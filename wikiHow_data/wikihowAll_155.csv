Take a big step forward with your right leg.,
Lower your body until your right knee is at a 90-degree angle.,
Push yourself upwards with your right foot.,
Repeat the forward lunge.",How to Do Lunges1," Start by standing up straight with your feet hip-width apart and flat on the ground. Relax your shoulders and allow your shoulder blades to sink down towards your hips. Keep yourself in this position by flexing your abdominal muscles to keep your spine straight and stable.Throughout a lunge exercise your arms and hands can be in any position that helps you maintain your balance. Some people may prefer to put their hands on their hips while others may prefer to keep their arms held out to the side or in front of them.
Ideally you should keep your back straight throughout a lunge exercise. This means you should try to keep your head upright while looking straight ahead; however, if you need to look down to ensure you’re in the right position, that’s okay.
Some people find it helpful to stare at a particular space on a wall (or another object) directly in front of them to help keep their balance.;
, Place your right foot on the ground, heel first. Lean your body forward so that about 70% of your weight is on your front foot. Keep your back and upper body straight. Hold this position.







, While keeping your upper body and back straight, continue to move your body forward until your right upper leg (thigh) is parallel to the floor. You may need to bend your hips slightly to stay in this position, but keep your back straight.








Do not to move your right knee past your toes. Your right knee should be positioned directly above your right ankle.
Once in the lunge position, your left (back) knee should also form a 90-degree angle, but your lower leg (shin) will be parallel to the ground while your upper leg (thigh) will be perpendicular to the ground.
Due to the position you’re in, you will only be able to keep your left toes on the ground. Your left heel will lift off the ground as you lean forward.

, Use your right foot to push yourself upwards. Return your body to the position you started in, standing straight with your feet hip-width apart.







, Once you’ve completed a lunge with your right leg, you can either switch sides and perform a lunge with your left leg, or you can continue to work your right side. It doesn’t matter what order you do lunges in, but try to do an equal number of lunges using both your left and right side before you finish.








Another alternative is to do a stationary lunge. Instead of stepping forward and back each time, rise up from the lunge by straightening your legs, but don't change the positioning of your feet. Then lower back down into the lunge by returning to bent knees.
Repeat this several times and then switch to your left side.

Exercise in short intervals.,
Work on high knees.,
Try burpees.,
Use skier jumps.,
Work on tap backs.,
Do squats.,
Work on corkscrews.,
Try donkey kicks.,
Move on to mountain climbers.,
Move back and forth in sets.",How to Do Cardio at Home2," Cardio requires that you keep your heart up for a certain amount of time. For this reason, it is best to time your exercise within sets of 30 to 60 seconds. Rest for 30 seconds between each set and exercise.

When you first begin, you might carry on these intervals and rest breaks until you have done ten minutes of exercise. As time goes on, work your way up to exercising for twenty or thirty minutes at a time.

, This workout is basically walking in place. However, you bring your knees up much higher than you normally would, until your thigh is about perpendicular to your body or a bit higher. As you bring one knee up, swing the opposite arm up, too. Alternate between knees for between 30 and 60 seconds. Go at a fast, steady rhythm., When doing a burpee, start in a standing position. Using your knees to prepare yourself (bend down), jump up into the air, swinging your arms as you go. As you land, bend your knees down, and move to the ground. Get in a plank position, with your palms on the ground, then do a pushup. As you come out of the pushup, propel yourself back to standing and start over again. Trying doing burpees for a solid minute straight., In a standing position, place your legs and feet together. Now, jump back and forth from side to side, going as fast as you can. Try to land gently by bending your knees. Keep your chest out. Go back and forth for about a minute., Stand up straight with your legs shoulder-width apart. Step back with one leg. As you step back, swing your arms forward so that they're out straight in front of you. Switch to the other leg. You aren't actually moving backwards, just alternating legs and swinging your arms forward.Aim to do between 15 and 24 tap backs within thirty to sixty seconds., Stand with your feet at shoulder-width. Your arms should be straight out in front of you. Bend your knees to lower yourself to the floor. Your thighs should end up like you're sitting in a chair, and your back should stay straight. Your knees should stay above your ankle, not go over the front of your feet.Try to do 15 to 24 squats over the period of 30 to 60 seconds for one set. If you can't do that many, just do what you can within that time.
Work your way up to doing two or three sets. Once you are able to do that, you can start adding weight, either by using dumbbells or by holding something heavy, such as a jug of water.

, Begin in a plank or pushup position. Your hands should be flat on the ground at shoulder width, and you should be supporting yourself on the balls of your feet with your body straight. Kick your left leg out under you towards your right hand, extending your right hand as you do. Touch your foot, and return your leg and arm back to the starting position. Do the same with the other leg and arm.Alternate legs for up to a minute., Start in a plank or pushup position. Your palms should be flat to the floor, and you should have the balls of your feet supporting you. Your body should be mostly straight. From this position, kick your feet up into the air behind you. You're trying to lightly kick yourself in the butt, but just get as far as you can. Land back on the balls of your feet, making sure to straighten your legs back out.Start with 30 seconds of this exercise and then work your way up to a full minute.

, To do a mountain climber, get down on the ground like you're going to do a pushup. Your palms should be on the ground, shoulder-width apart. Your body should be up in the air but straight. The balls of your feet and toes should be on the ground, supporting your weight.Bring one knee up towards your chest. It should be under your body, and you should look like a runner about to take off on a race.
Move that knee back down and bring up the other knee.
Alternate legs for between ten and sixty seconds.

, Once you find some exercises you like, try moving back and forth in sets. If you're just starting out, try 6 sets of various exercises. If you're a bit more advance, do 8 sets. If you've been working out for a while, you can do 10 sets instead. Alternating between different exercises will help you work up a sweat, as well as work on different muscle groups."

Determine what you will culture.,
Prepare the culture environment.,
Decide what type of substrate you will provide.,
Follow the manufacturer’s protocols for starting the culture.,
Feed the cells if you are working with mammalian cells.,
Split cultures that are starting to get crowded.",How to Do a Tissue Culture," It is possible to culture both plant and animal cells. Sometimes people want to culture tissue that has been obtained directly from a plant or animal. Other times the cells are cultured from a cell line that was previously cultured and stored.New cultures may be created from taking tissue from an organism. These cells are called a primary culture. They will only divide for so long before they go through senescence.
A continuous cell line has been altered using chemicals or viruses so that the cells will continue to divide indefinitely.;
, The conditions will be different for different types of cells, but in general, the culture will require:A controlled temperature. The best temperature will vary on the type of cells you are growing, but it will probably be between 20-45 C.
A controlled pH. The best pH will likely be somewhere between 6.0 and 7.5.
A controlled osmotic pressure
Adequate exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide
Hormones
Growth factors
A substrate that will provide the cells with the nutrients they need. This includes amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals.
Light. Light is crucial if you are growing plant cells which must photosynthesize., Many cell types grow best when they are attached to a substrate. Possible types of substrates include:A solid substrate, also called adherent. Tissues obtained from organs like kidneys are usually adherent because they are fixed in connective tissue.
A semi-solid or monolayer substrate. These types of cultures generally form a layer one cell deep on the bottom.
A suspension culture. Cells of this type do not need to be anchored to the substrate, and will grow while floating instead. Cells from blood are often cultured in suspension.

, There are several companies that supply laboratories with materials and equipment for conducting cultures. When you purchase the materials, they will also come with protocols for starting the culture. These protocols will describe exactly how you should transfer the sample that you want to culture into the culture environment. Several well-known companies include:


Qiagen
Fisher Scientific
Thermo Scientific

, It is generally necessary to replenish the culture media every 2 – 3 days. Follow the manufacturer’s protocols for feeding the cells.This process should take 20 minutes or less.
If you do not provide sufficient nutrients, the cells that you do have will die.

, In order to keep the culture growing, you may need to move some of the cells into a new dish with a lower density. This will enable both the original culture and the new one to continue growing.You can also freeze some of the cultures for future work or to repeat experiments if you have problems with contamination in the future. Follow the provided protocols to determine the temperature for cryopreservation or freezing the cultures.

Monitor any itching in the abdomen that you feel.,
Look for any rashes on your body.,
Pay attention to any pain you feel in your abdomen.,
Monitor any sudden and unexplained weight loss.,
Watch out for gagging or coughing that you experience.,
Look for any blood in your stool.",How to Deworm Yourself1," If you have worms, you may feel an itching in your abdomen that is not normal. This itchiness occurs because the worms release toxins in your body that your immune system responds to like an allergic reaction., Like the itchiness you feel, another reaction that your immune system will produce is a rash. This is again caused by the toxic fluids that the worms leak into our system that causes a hypersensitive reaction in the form of a rash.


The rash will most likely show up as red bumps that might itch.

, Some worms can create an obstruction (or blockage) in your intestines. A few worms will causes ulcers, which in turn can cause severe pain in your abdomen. Worms that can cause obstructions in the intestine includeRound worms.
Tapeworms.
Hookworms.

, If you have a worm (or worms) in your body, you may experience sudden weight loss without trying to lose weight. This is because worms extract the nutrients from the food that you eat, which means that you don’t get any of the good nutrients that you normally get when you eat food.

, These symptoms are most commonly associated with roundworms. This type of worm has a tendency to travel from the stomach, up into the chest area. When they move, they can cause you to gag because they are a foreign body moving through your system.

, Some types of worms, particularly hookworms, actually hook themselves into the lining of your intestine, which can cause a wound to form. Whether or not the worm moves, the wound will continue to bleed. This blood can make its way through your intestine and into your stool.


The blood can show up as a reddish color in your stool, or your stools may look black, signifying older blood.

Pick a 30-day period to complete the challenge.,
Perform at least 100 lunges per week.,
Work your way up to 100 lunges per day.,
Track your achievement.",How to Do Lunges5," A 30-day lunge challenge is a great way to practice all types of lunges and get a great workout on a regular basis. Having a specific goal in mind when exercising can at times, increase your motivation. Before you get started, however, you’ll need to select a 30-day period that works best for you. Using an actual calendar month will probably be the most convenient and easiest to follow., Ideally, you should perform some lunges on a daily basis, but you don’t need to perform all 100 every day right from day one. Start by performing 20 – 30 lunges per day until you can build up your endurance; however, try to fit in at least 100 lunges every week.







, Once you’ve built up some endurance and energy, try to perform all 100 lunges every day. The lunges can be broken down as follows:








30 forward lunges, 15 for each leg
40 side lunges, 20 to each side
30 reverse lunges, 15 for each leg

, Keep track of the number of lunges you do every day, and which lunges you were able to perform. Even if you are not able to work your way up to 100 lunges a day, by tracking your progress you’ll be able to see how much you’ve improved over the 30 days.Regardless of your progress, reward yourself with something at the end of the 30 days. Keep that reward in mind throughout the 30 days as an incentive to keep going. (If you're trying to lose weight, don't reward yourself with food. A movie, a new book or an afternoon walk in the park are better rewards.)

Determine if you have a family history of colon or uterine cancer.,
Watch for signs of colon cancer.",How to Diagnose Lynch Syndrome1," One of the main symptoms for Lynch syndrome is a family history of colon and uterine cancer, especially at a young age.If you have recently been diagnosed with colon cancer you may have Lynch syndrome, especially if you are under 50 years old.
If you are healthy and young, but more than one immediate family member had confirmed colon cancer at age 50 or younger, you may be carrying the gene for Lynch syndrome that puts you at higher risk, and you should see a doctor for genetic testing. This can help identify if you should begin screening with colonoscopies at much younger age than normally recommended.;
, Lynch syndrome is a genetic mutation that causes an increased risk of colon and uterine cancer — Lynch syndrome itself does not have any symptoms. The only way to diagnose Lynch syndrome is to get tested by your doctor. If you believe you may be at risk because of a family history of colon or uterine cancer, you should be vigilant for signs of colon cancer, even at a young age.


Monitor changes of bowel habits. The changes in bowel habits may last for more than a few days. These changes may be diarrhea, constipation, a thinner or narrower stool, and the feeling that you need to have a bowel movement after just passing one.Look for blood in the stool. Another symptom of colon cancer is traces of blood in your bowel movements. This includes rectal bleeding or blood in the stool. You may see red blood or the stool may look very dark and tarry.Monitor for other bodily changes. Lynch syndrome connected with colon or other cancers may cause weakness and fatigue in someone who has it. A person may also experience unintended or unexplained weight loss.You may also experience cramping or abdominal pain.

Recognize the signs and symptoms of a streptococcal infection.Scarlet fever is caused by the bacteria Group A Strep, which is the same bacteria that causes strep throat.,
Be on the lookout for the characteristic scarlet fever rash.In addition to a sore throat, the hallmark of how scarlet fever presents is as a skin infection.,
Know who is at higher risk.Scarlet fever is most common in children and adolescents between the ages of five and 15.",How to Diagnose and Treat Scarlet Fever1," The most common early symptoms are a fever and a sore throat, as well as sore and swollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck. This may or may not be followed by abdominal pain, vomiting, and/or chills.


With a Group A Strep infection, your tonsils are often coated with white chunks (called ""exudate"") that can be seen if you open your mouth very wide and look in a mirror.
A sore throat caused by Group A Strep usually does not have a cough, which is one way that you can differentiate it from other infections.;
, The scarlet fever rash caused by Group A Strep is usually red with a rough feel, similar to sandpaper. The rash may be the first symptom to appear, or it may appear up to seven days following the onset of other signs and symptoms.


The rash typically begins by affecting your neck, your underarms, and your groin area.
The rash can then spread to affect other areas of the body.
The rash is often accompanied by a very red tongue (called a ""strawberry tongue""), a flushed face, and red lines in various skin folds including the groin, armpits, knees and elbows.

, Therefore, if your child develops these symptoms, it is important to bring him or her to a doctor immediately. Keep in mind, however, that Group A Strep infections and scarlet fever can develop in people of any age.

Choose an ALS expert.,
Check with your health insurance.",How to Diagnose ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)," If you have a family history of ALS, you should talk with a doctor about watching out for symptoms.Having a family member who has ALS is the only known risk factor for the disease.;
, People with a family history of ALS might want to talk to a genetic counselor to find out more about risk for the disease.


Ten percent of people who have ALS have a genetic predisposition for the disease., If you have symptoms of ALS, contact your doctor. Frequently the first symptoms of ALS include:Muscle weakness in arm(s) or leg(s)
Arm or leg twitching
Slurred or labored speech
More advanced symptoms of ALS can include: difficulty swallowing, difficulty walking or performing daily activities, lack of voluntary muscle control needed for tasks like eating, speaking, and breathing.

, Talk to a doctor or clinic about getting evaluated for ALS if you have symptoms and especially if you also have a family history of the disease.


Testing can take several days and require a variety of different evaluations.
No single test can determine if you have ALS.Diagnosis includes observation of some symptoms and test to rule out other diseases.,  Physicians will often look for the CK enzyme (Creatine Kinase), which presents in the blood after muscle damage from ALS has occurred. Blood tests can also be used to check for genetic predisposition, as certain cases of ALS can be familial.,  Muscle biopsies can be performed to determine if other muscular disorders are present in an attempt rule out ALS. In this test, the doctor removes a small bit of muscle tissue to test using a needle or a small incision. The test only uses local anesthesia and does not usually require a hospital stay. The muscle may be sore for a few days., Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain can help to identify other possible neurological conditions that present with similar symptoms as ALS.


The test uses magnets to create a detailed picture of your brain or spine. The test involves laying very still for a period of time while the machine creates an image of your body.,  Physicians can extract a small amount of CSF from the spine to attempt to identify other possible conditions. CSF circulates through the brain and spinal cord and is an effective medium for identifying neurological conditions.For this test the patient usually lies on her side. The doctor injects an anesthetic to numb the lower spine area. Then a needle is inserted into the lower spine and a sample of spinal fluid is collected.The procedure only takes about 30 minutes. It can include minor pain and discomfort., Electromyogram (EMG) can be used to measure electrical signals in your muscles. This allows doctors to see if the muscle nerves are working normally.A tiny instrument is inserted into a muscle to record its electrical activity. The test may cause a feeling like a twinge or spasm and may produce minor pain or discomfort., Nerve condition studies (NCS) can be used to measure your the electrical signals in your muscles and nerves. This test uses small electrodes placed on the skin to measure the passage of electrical signals in between. It may feel like a mild tingling feeling.If needles are used to insert electrodes there may be a small amount of pain from the needle., If your condition is harming the muscles that control breathing a repository test may be used to find out.These tests usually involve different ways to measure breathing. They are usually short and just involve breathing into different testing devices under particular conditions., After speaking to your regular doctor, follow up with another physician to get a second opinion. The ALS association recommends that ALS patients always get an opinion from a second doctor who works in this field because there are other diseases that have the same set of symptoms as ALS., Even if you feel reluctant to bring this up with your current doctor, he or she will likely be supportive because this is a complicated and serious condition.Ask your doctor to recommend a second person to see.

, When getting a second opinion about an ALS diagnosis, talk to an ALS expert who works with many ALS patients.Even some doctors who specialize in neurological conditions do not regularly diagnose and treat patients with ALS, so talking to someone with specific experience is important.
Between 10% and 15% of patients diagnosed with ALS actually have a different condition or disease.As many as 40% of people with ALS are first diagnosed as having a different disease with similar symptoms even though they actually have ALS., Before you get a second opinion you may want to check with your health insurance company to find out how your policy covers the cost of a second opinion.Some health insurance policies do not cover second opinion doctor visits.
Some policies have particular rules about selecting physicians for a second opinion so that the cost is covered by the plan.

Drink lots and lots of water.,
Fill up on fruit.,
Don't forget the berries!,
Incorporate more barley into your diet.,
Keep away from things like alcohol, caffeine, and chocolate.,
Avoid protein.,
Try dandelion.,
Experiment with uva ursi or Bear’s grape.,
Consider using gokshura.,
Look into using European barberry.,
Always talk to your doctor before taking alternative medicines.,
Seek medical treatment for serious kidney problems.,
Diagnose a kidney infection.,
Know the symptoms of kidney stones.,
Understand the limits of natural treatments.",How to Detoxify Your Kidneys Naturally," The most important thing for a regular kidney detox is to have a high intake of natural, clean water. Having around 8 glasses of water per day (more if you sweat or are athletic) helps to filter out the accumulated toxins. A good indication of this would be passing clear urine which is not very strong smelling. If the urine is anything deeper than a pale yellow, it means that it is concentrated. Passing clear urine is an indication of a clean filtering system.Fluids in the form of colas, coffees and aerated drinks are not a good substitute for natural water.


Different teas and juices have been advocated for the detoxification of kidneys, this is true. However, medically, it is only pure clean water that has been proven to help your kidneys. It is true that different teas and juices can have helpful substances such as vitamins and minerals. However, these also contain high concentrations of caffeine or sugar which can also be detrimental to your kidneys. Remember that water is still the best.;
, Fruits and vegetables that are rich in potassium aid in cleansing the kidneys. Citrus fruits like grapes, sweet lime, oranges, cantaloupes, bananas, kiwis, apricots and prunes are all rich sources of potassium.Milk and yogurt are another good source of potassium, too.


Including these fruits in your daily diet helps maintain the level of electrolytes in your blood which then keeps the kidney functioning at its optimum. A glass of grape juice consumed daily in the morning or afternoon is known to clear the build up of excess uric acid, a by product of kidney filtration.
One must have a balanced intake of potassium rich food. Excessive intake of potassium can lead to a condition known as hyperkalemia which can prove fatal and cause a cardiac arrest. People who have kidney problems like kidney failure cannot have too much potassium. A healthy person is allowed to have up to 4.7 grams of potassium per day., Berries like cranberries help in cleansing the kidney. Cranberries contain a nutrient called quinine which converts itself into hippuric acid through a series of metabolic changes in the liver. Hippuric acid clears the excess buildup of urea and uric acid in the kidneys. A cupful of cranberries is enough to cleanse the kidney each day.Scientific studies have proven that cranberry is also very useful in treating as preventing urinary tract infections as it as an anti-bacterial., Barley is another excellent grain that is used to cleanse as well as to prevent damage happening in the kidney due to uncontrolled diabetes. Note that barley is not a cure, but just an adjunct along with other methods to maintain optimum functioning of the kidneys. Barley is a whole grain, and substituting barley flour in place of refined flours is a good way of including barley in your diet.


Another way to get more barley is to soak a handful of barley in water at night and drink the same water first thing in the morning. This cleanses and repairs the build up of kidney toxins.It has also been seen that regular consumption of barley helps in maintaining the creatinine levels, or bringing it down to normal in the case of diabetics., Though scientists still argue about this, the possible list of things to avoid includes alcohol, caffeine, chocolate, nuts, and processed foods.These are not so much recommended to be avoided because they're bad for your kidneys, but that they can have adverse reactions in your body overall. Regardless of whether you're detoxifying or not, it's a good idea to limit your intake of all these things.


However, do know that studies show no conclusive evidence that supports the claim that these should be avoided when it comes to your kidneys. Up to now, there is no final conclusion when it comes to this subject matter.

, The only kind of food that has been proven to be detrimental to the kidneys is high-protein foods. Not often you hear that, huh? Turns out they are harmful because their digestion and metabolism produce the highest amount of waste by-products. This waste by-product is called creatinine and is the main reason why creatinine is being measured in patients with kidney disease. If the creatinine levels go up, then there must be a problem in the filtering and eliminating function of the kidney. For this reason, to keep your creatinine down, eat less protein.


For adults with a kidney disease such as chronic renal failure, it is recommended to limit the daily protein intake to only 0.8 gram per kg body weight per day. This is according to the KDOQI (National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) Clinical Practice Guidelines and Clinical Practice Recommendations for Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease. So for the usual 60-kg adult male, only 48 grams of protein is allowed per day. This is roughly equivalent to only one slice of pork chop and one slice of cheese!
Talk to your doctor about this beforehand. Protein is a very important element of your diet and should not be avoided for most individuals.

, Dandelion is an herb which is used as a food additive in various preparations like salads, dressings, teas, coffees and chocolates. Dandelion is rich in potassium and has a diuretic-like action, meaning it helps clear away excess water from the body. Hence, its very useful in increasing the urinary output.


As a cleansing agent, taking about 10-15 drops of dandelion mother tincture 3 times a day is useful to detox the kidneys and can be safely continued for up to 6 months., This is an excellent natural supplement for kidney detox. It helps to repair the inflammation and injury caused to the tissues in the kidney as a result of infections or stones. It contains a glycoside known as arbutin which has anti-microbial properties, thereby helping in treating urinary tract infections.


There's more! It also has a muscle relaxant-like action which helps to bring down the swelling in the urinary tract or muscles. It neutralises the acidic content of the urine thereby alleviating the burning pain caused due to infections.
It is generally safe to have this supplement, however a word of caution for patients who are on anti psychotic drugs like lithium. Uva ursi can interfere with the way the body gets rid of lithium and this could lead to a high level of lithium in the blood which can be toxic or fatal.Hence, people with any other co-morbidities must be careful before employing Uva ursi in detoxing their kidneys.

, This is an Ayurvedic supplement which boosts kidney health and is beneficial to those who suffer from recurrent urinary tract infections as well as recurrent renal stones. It helps in maintaining the flow of urine and also cools and soothes the urinary membranes there by relieving the pain. Along with it, it also possesses antibiotic properties and takes care of bladder infections.


A capsule of Gokshura can be consumed once or twice a day to maintain renal function.

, This is an age old supplement known to flush out renal stones. In homeopathy, a mother tincture prepared from this herb, known as Berberis Vulgaris, has relieved umpteen patients from renal colic and has saved them from going under the knife. However, the size of the stones should be smaller than the diameter of urethra, otherwise a bigger stone can harm the epithelium of the urethra when it attempts to come out.10-15 drops of the mother tincture mixed with a little water taken three times a day often flushes out the stones within a few weeks.

, This detox is not for people in poor health. It's not a balanced diet, it's not sustainable, and it has to be done correctly. What's more, certain supplements may not be good for you. To do this the most effective way, talk to a health professional.


Certain medicines that you are on for your blood pressure or diabetes could interfere with these diets and wreak havoc on the kidneys. Hence when on certain medications, you should be cautious. For example, the anti-hypertensive group of drugs like ACE inhibitors, with trade names like ramipril, lisinopril, benazepril, etc., increase the level of potassium in the blood. Along with this if you have a high potassium diet, it can lead to a significantly high level of potassium in the blood which can be fatal. Patients who have an abnormal creatinine level should refrain from eating on a diet that is very high in protein.
Thus, the maximum benefit of a kidney detox programme can be attained by people who are otherwise healthy, but have a history of recurrent urinary tract infections or kidney stones.

, Natural detoxification may be effective for strengthening your body and healing mild kidney damage. However, your condition might be too far advanced for natural treatment if you're suffering from a severe case like a kidney stone, an infection, a tumor, or a cyst. In especially serious cases, a kidney malfunction can lead to organ failure and system shutdown. Be proactive and catch it early!, Common symptoms of kidney infections include fever and chills; fatigue, confusion, and loss of appetite; back or side pain, where your kidney is located; bloody, cloudy, or foul-smelling urine; and painful, frequent urination.Make an appointment with a doctor if you notice many of these symptoms, and if you are at all worried that you're developing a kidney infection. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these symptoms in combination with bloody urine, nausea, or vomiting.A severe kidney infection can cause life-threatening complications. Do not take this lightly!

, One in 20 people develop kidney stones at some point during their life, and it never hurts to inform yourself about the possibility.Visit a doctor as soon as possible—or head to the emergency room— if you experience many of the following symptoms:

Severe pain in the flank and back, below the ribs. This may spread to the lower abdomen and groin. It will come in waves and fluctuate in intensity.
Painful urination; a persistent need to urinate more than usual; and urinating in small amounts.
Pink, red or brown urine; cloudy or foul-smelling urine
Nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills., A kidney detox may supplement another recovery program, and it can be a great way to maintain general health and well-being. However, severe kidney afflictions may require surgeries, prescription regimes, or even dialysis. If you are trying to detoxify your kidneys in order to treat a painful or serious condition, make sure to ask a doctor for advice before leaping into any radical diet or supplement regimen."

Determine your required protein intake.,
Determine your required fat intake.,
Add the calories from protein and fats, and subtract this calculated number from your required daily calories to determine the number of calories you can have from carbohydrates.,
Determine the grams of carbohydrates required/day.",How to Determine Your Required Macronutrient Intake," A safe recommendation is 1g/lb of body weight.


For example, if you are 200lbs, that correlates to 200g of protein/day. Since protein is 4 calories/g, this means that 800 (200 x 4) of the required calories for the day need to come from protein.;
, This can be anywhere from 0.35 to 0.5g per pound of body weight.


For women, the recommended amount is towards the higher end of the range. Since fats are 9 calories/g, determine how many calories need to come from fat using the same method as step 1.
For example, for a 200lb male, the number of grams of fat could be anywhere from 70-100g, or 630 to 900 calories from fat.

,


Using the previous example of a 200lbs male, this would equal 1430-1700 calories from fats and protein, which when subtracted from the required daily calories would yield the calories available from carbohydrates.

, This is done by dividing the available calories from carbohydrates by 4 since 1g of carbohydrate is 4 calories.

Eat the seeds of a papaya.,
Up your intake of pineapple.,
Mix a banana and lemon juice.,
Drink pomegranate juice.,
Eat pumpkin seeds.,
Take one to two tablespoons of castor oil a day.,
Try different herbs and extracts.",How to Deworm Yourself3," The seeds inside a papaya contain carpaine, benzylisothiocyanate, benzylglucosinolate, glucotropacolin, benzylthiourea, hentriacontane, sitosterol, caricin and an enzyme called myrosin, all of which help to kill parasites. They also help the intestines to contract and reduce inflammation caused by the worms. You can eat the seeds whole or dry them and make them into a powder that you can eat with yogurt and honey.

, This fruit contains a digestive enzyme called bromelain that specifically combats tapeworms by removing the free radicals the worm produces. The acidity of the pineapple also decreases the amount of glucose available to the worm, which causes it to starve and die., Take one banana, mush it up, and mix it with one teaspoon of lemon juice. Bananas act like a natural laxative, which helps to remove worms. The oligosaccharides present in bananas stimulate the intestine to contract, while lemon has antibacterial, antiprotozoal properties that help kill parasites., You can drink five glasses of pomegranate juice a day to cleanse your intestines and rid yourself of parasites. Each glass should contain about eight ounces of pomegranate juice.

, Pumpkin seeds contain a compound called as cucurbitacins which paralyze the worms in your body by attacking their nervous system, which causes them to stop growing and eventually die. These seeds also contain several other worm-killing nutrients like flavonoids, palmitic, oleic and linoleic acids.


You should eat at least 10 to 15 pumpkin seeds a day., If you decide to use this method, you should take the castor oil on an empty stomach for a greater effect. The oil induces diarrhea which helps to flush the worms from your symptom.


You should talk to your doctor before using this method, as some worms, like hookworms, attach to your intestines and having diarrhea could make them dig in harder and more painfully.

, Some herbs and extracts also have worm-killing properties. You can increase the amount of these herbs that you use in your cooking, or take supplements. The herbs and extract include:


Garlic: Studies have shown that eating one to two cloves of garlic a day can combat intestinal parasites. This is because garlic contains allicin, a broad spectrum antibiotic that kills parasites.Coconut oil: Coconut oil contains caprylic acid which has medium-chain fatty acids that have anti-parasitic and anti-bacterial components.
Oil of oregano: This extract contains two antimicrobial properties, thymol and carvacrol, which help to manage parasitic infections.

It does this by promoting the creation of more white blood cells, which fight parasites and other infections.You should take 500 mg of echinacea supplement once a day.

, This is a type of spice that helps to cleanse the body and rid it of disease-causing bacteria, including bad bacteria and worms found in your intestine. It also contains curcumin, a nutrient that eradicates worms and bad bacteria.You can 500 mg of turmeric supplements twice a day.

, Uva ursi, or bearberry, supplements contain a substance called arbutin. It has a bactericidal effect on worms, meaning that it inhibits cell wall repair, so worms and other bad microorganisms die.Take 800 mg a day with food.

, Vitaklenz is a supplement that contains 12 all-natural herbs that help to cleanse the intestines. It also stimulates your body to produce more phagocytes, which are cells that destroy foreign bodies like worms and other parasites.You can take one capsule of vitaklenz three times a day.

Visit your doctor.,
Determine if you are genetically predisposed.,
Get a tumor test.,
Get a genetic test.",How to Diagnose Lynch Syndrome2," If you think you are at risk for Lynch syndrome, you should visit your doctor, who will most likely refer you to see a specialist in genetics called a Medical Geneticist. They are experts in providing genetic testing, counseling, and management of genetic disease like lynch syndrome.


You should see your doctor if you experience any of the physical symptoms, or have a family history of colon or other related cancer.

, Lynch syndrome may be suspected if there is a family history of colon, endometrial, and other cancers, especially if those cancers showed up in younger family members. The diagnosis is determined by doing genetic testing.Your doctor may also ask about relatives with tumors of the stomach, small intestine, brain, kidney, liver, or ovaries, as the gene that is mutated in Lynch syndrome increases the risk for a number of different cancers.
Your doctor will probably ask about cancer in previous generations, especially if you have multigenerational cancer patients in your family.

, If you or a family member have tumors, the doctor can do testing on the tumor to see if you have Lynch syndrome. He can determine if certain proteins are in the tumors which indicate Lynch syndrome.If the tumor test proves positive, you may not have Lynch Syndrome. The mutations may develop just in the tumors or cancer cells. After a positive, your doctor can perform genetic tests to decide for sure if you have Lynch Syndrome.
If anyone in your family has had cancer in the last few years, the hospital may still have a tissue sample your doctor can test.

, Currently there are tests available for a number of the mutations that occur in Lynch syndrome. These tests screen for mutations in the the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and EPCAM genes.You can have your doctor send out your blood for testing, but you can also have your blood tested by a number of different labs. If you are interested in outside testing, check out Myriad myRisk, Quest Diagnostics, and Invitae.

Know that Lynch syndrome is a heredity condition.,
Understand what being positive for Lynch syndrome means.,
See your doctor for a cancer prevention program.",How to Diagnose Lynch Syndrome3," Lynch syndrome is a genetic condition. The genetic error that exists in those people with Lynch syndrome is a group of genes that code for proteins that actually help to repair genes.


This group of genes are for “mismatch repair genes,” which are those genes that repair the relatively common mistakes when DNA reproduces itself. Errors in this matching process can be repaired normally, but in Lynch Syndrome, they cannot be repaired because the genes that code for the proteins that do the repair are themselves damaged.The cause of the cancers associated with Lynch syndrome is believed to be an accumulation of these errors mutations in the DNA.
If a mother or a father has one copy out of two of this gene, there is a 50% chance that it was passed on to their child.

, If your genetic test is positive for Lynch syndrome, it means that your lifetime risk of cancer is between 60 and 80%. It does not mean you will definitely have colon or endometrial cancer, but the risk of colon and endometrial cancer as well as other cancers is increased.


The lifetime risk of endometrial cancer can range from 20 to 60%.
The lifetime risk of other cancers are increased by less than 20%., Lynch syndrome is not treatable. If your genetic testing is positive, this means that you will need to consult with a genetic counselor as well as your physician to determine your best course of action for cancer prevention and future screening.This is likely to include a yearly colonoscopy, a yearly endometrial biopsy, as well as other screening tests, depending on your gender.

See your physician.If you have a severe sore throat without a cough and white exudate on your tonsils, you should definitely book an appointment to see your doctor as soon as possible.,
Obtain a throat swab.If your doctor agrees that your sore throat is worrisome for Group A Strep, she will perform a throat swab right then and there in the office.,
See your doctor immediately if you have developed the characteristic rash of scarlet fever.",How to Diagnose and Treat Scarlet Fever2," A sore throat that presents in this way is likely to be caused by Group A Strep. Your doctor will perform diagnostic tests to confirm it and will offer you treatment as needed.

, It is a procedure that does not take more than a few minutes. A sample is taken from the back of your throat and sent into the lab to test for the presence of streptococcal bacteria. If the test comes back positive, you will need to proceed with antibiotic treatment.

, Your doctor will perform a physical exam to evaluate the rash and the potential signs of scarlet fever in more detail. If enough signs and symptoms are present, he will offer you immediate antibiotic treatment.

Take over-the-counter painkillers.To manage the pain of your sore throat and also to control fever, your best bet is to take Acetaminophen (Tylenol), which is available over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or drugstore.,
Use throat lozenges.Another way to help control the pain of a sore throat is to purchase lozenges — these can often be found at either a grocery store or a pharmacy.,
Drink plenty of fluids.Anytime your body is in the midst of fighting off an infection, you become more prone than normal to dehydration.,
Ask for a prescription for Penicillin.Penicillin is usually the antibiotic of choice in the treatment of streptococcal infections (the bacteria responsible for scarlet fever).,
Understand the risk of developing long-term complications from scarlet fever.The most important reason to receive antibiotics is not to treat the initial infection, but rather, to prevent serious complications from developing down the road.",How to Diagnose and Treat Scarlet Fever3," The typical dosing is limited to a total of 3000 mg in a 24 hour period;follow the specific dosing instructions on the bottle, and pay attention to dose adjustments (to smaller amounts) for children.


Another over-the-counter pain control medication that you can try is Ibuprofen (Advil). Follow the dosing instructions on the bottle, which is typically 400mg every four to six hours as needed. Again, you will want to adjust the dosing for children.

, Many lozenges contain anti-microbial properties to help fight off infection, as well as anesthetic (numbing) properties to help diminish the pain of a sore throat. Do not take more lozenges per day than the number recommended on the label.


Another way to soothe sore throat pain is to try a saltwater gargle, which can be done several times a day.

, Therefore, it is key to consume at least eight to ten 8-ounce cups of water per day, and more if you are feeling thirsty. A fever also worsens dehydration, so it is important to make an effort to stay adequately hydrated.

, If your throat swab comes back positive for Group A Strep, or if you have the characteristic rash of scarlet fever, it is important to follow through with a full course of antibiotic treatment for a number of reasons. These include:


Antibiotics will help your symptoms to clear up faster, and will help your immune system to fight off the infection.Treatment with antibiotics will diminish the risk of your infection spreading to others.
Most importantly, completing the full course of antibiotics, even if you appear to be getting better on your own, is key to preventing antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains from developing.
The biggest risk with scarlet fever is not the infection itself, but rather, the risk of long-term complications.

, Potential long-term complications of scarlet fever include:


Kidney disease
More serious skin infections
Pneumonia
Rheumatic fever (an inflammatory disease that can lead to valvular damage of the heart that leads to heart failure)Ear infections
Arthritis in your joints
Throat abscesses (serious infections in the throat area that can be very difficult to treat)

Wipe off your mat.,
Consider placing towels on your mat during practice.,
Air out your mat regularly.",How to Clean a Yoga Mat," You should wash your yoga mat completely every couple of months, and more often if you don’t practice regular maintenance or you perform yoga every day. This can not only extend the life of your mat, but will also keep it from smelling and transferring bacteria to you.If you practice yoga every day, you may want to wash your mat once a month, especially during hot weather.
The more soil you see on your mat, the more likely it needs to be thoroughly washed.
If your yoga mat is peeling or pieces of it are adhering to your clothes, consider purchasing a new mat.;
, Use a solution of warm water and a mild detergent such as dish soap. Submerge your yoga mat in a bathtub and allow it to soak for a few minutes. This will help dislodge dirt, oils and any odors.Dish soap or hypoallergenic laundry detergent are two of the best options for mild cleaners for your yoga mat.Avoid using too much detergent in the warm water. You want just enough soap to clean off your mat. Using too much detergent can make your mat slippery and difficult to practice asanas on.Mix 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of laundry detergent or dish soap for every 1 gallon (3.7 l) of lukewarm tap water.
Some sources suggest using vinegar to wash your mat. Be aware that this can leave a lasting and unpleasant scent on the surface of your mat, which could make practicing yoga less enjoyable. Depending on the material of your yoga mat, vinegar may also degrade the quality of the mat.

, Once your mat has soaked for a few minutes, use a soft cloth to wash both sides of the mat. Thoroughly wipe each side, concentrating on the areas that your hands and feet touch most often.You can tell the areas you use the most because they will likely have a slightly different color to the rest of your mat.
Make sure you wipe each side gently so that you do not degrade the mat or pull off any chunks of it.
If you do not see bubbles from the detergent, that is fine. Remember that you only want enough detergent—and bubbles—to clean the mat and not make it slippery.
Never put your yoga mat in a washing machine. It can significantly degrade the quality of your mat and make it impossible to practice on the mat because it is too slippery.

, Drain the tub in which you have your mat and rinse the washed mat with clean water. This will help remove any residue from the soap and minimize the risk of having a slippery mat.Rinse off the mat until you notice that the water is clear.If the water does not clear quickly, consider washing it off again with the soft cloth.

, Shake off your mat to remove water on the surface of your mat. Lay the mat flat on a dry towel and roll the two together to squeeze out remaining moisture.Do not wring out your mat! It may cause wrinkling, tearing or warping.
You can step on the rolled up mat and towel, which is more effective at getting out excess water., When you are done with squeezing out excess water, unroll your yoga mat from the towel. Hang it up until it is thoroughly dry.You can use pant hangers to hang up your mat, but understand these may leave marks.
If you have a laundry drying rack, drape your yoga mat over this, which can effectively dry both sides of your mat.
Never put a yoga mat in a clothes dryer. Not only can doing this ruin your mat, but may cause a fire.
Only use your mat again once it is completely dry. Squeezing bits of the mat between your fingers can help you feel remaining moisture.

, Dirt, oils, and sweat can quickly degrade the quality of your mat and make it more difficult to practice. Performing simple maintenance tasks on your yoga mat after each use can help extend its life and decrease how often you need to thoroughly wash the mat. If you practice yoga daily or multiple times per week, it’s important to clean off and store your mat properly after each use., Your hands and feet will constantly touch your mat, and these areas of the body tend to be dirty. Using your mat with clean skin can help extend the life of your mat and help bacteria from spreading between your skin and mat surface.


Cleaning your hands and feet will also wash off any lotions or creams that can degrade the mat and make you slip during practice.If you cannot wash your hands and feet prior to practice, consider using gentle baby wipes so that you can wipe off your palms and soles., Each time you practice yoga on your mat, wipe it off with either baby wipe, yoga mat specific wipe, or a cloth with some mild soap. Roll it up after it dries, and you are good to go. This can help to keep your mat clean and free of sweat, dirt, and oils, but may also extend its life.Wipes that are specifically formulated for yoga mats are available at sports stores or online at specialty yoga retailers.If you decide to use baby wipes to clean off your mat, buy a gentle version that does not have many detergents or soap on it to keep your mat from being slippery.If you decide to use a cloth with some soap, make sure to not overdo it with soap or water. Wipe off any excessive soap so that your mat does not get slippery.

, If you sweat a lot, you are in a hot room or just want a layer between you and your mat, place a towel on your mat. Towels can absorb excess moisture and make it easier to grip your mat.


Regular towels may slip around during use. It can become a hazard.
Try a yoga towel. These super absorbent towels come with special grips that will keep the material—and you—from slipping all over your mat.
You can buy yoga towels at some sports stores and at most online yoga specialty retailers.

, Most people will roll up their yoga mats after each use and cleaning and either store it in a mat bag or in a corner of their home or studio. Ideally, allow your mat to air out regularly to help evaporate lingering sweat or moisture and keep it smelling fresh.


You can hang up your mat on hangers or place it over a laundry rack. You want to make sure you are airing out both sides of your mat, even if you only practice on one side.
Consider only using your mat carrier for transport purposes so that your mat can air out thoroughly after each use.
Keep your mat in a cool, dry, location out of direct sunlight. This will also keep it from degrading. It will also avoid it accumulating excess moisture, which can help bacteria or fungi breed.

A first glance inside the cockpit at the 310 panel will reveal many more instruments and controls, and more modern ones.

,
Two tachometers
Two manifold pressure gauges
Two sets of engine temperature and pressure gauges.;
,,

The most noticeable difference, for this article, is in the Dual Control Pedestal.
The controls from left to right are:
Two throttles.
Two propeller controls.
Two fuel mixture controls.
Two fuel tank controls. Under the pedestal.

,

This panel has the newer ""Glass Panel"" which has all the instrumentation of the six pack panel, but concentrated into one glass panel, in a different format where airspeed and altitude are in vertical bar displays.
Note that three round gauges below the glass panel, were kept for backup. In case of glass panel failure.
Airspeed Indicator.
Artificial Horizon.
Altimeter.

, Memorize these speeds, you are sure to be asked about them in the oral test. These speeds vary with each aircraft, check in the manual of your aircraft.

VMC-93 knots. Minimum control speed. The airspeed, below which, the aircraft cannot be controlled, in flight with one engine out.
Vyse-106 knots. Best-Rate-of-Climb. The speed giving the best climb on one engine.
Vxse-95 knots. Best-Angle-of-Climb. The speed giving the best climb to clear a 50 feet (15.2 m) airport departure obstacle on one engine.

,
Must have a minimum of 10 hours of flight time, with an FAA qualified Flight Instructor, in a twin engine aircraft.
Must have made at least 5 take-offs and landings in the last 90 days, in a twin.
Sufficient training to master flight with one engine shut down.
Ground training in performing a more complicated pre-flight walk-around.
Know all the special speed, and other requirements with operation on both engines, and with one engine off.
Pass an oral exam with an FAA Inspector in all the items above.
Pass a flight check, with an FAA inspector, demonstrating all of the above.

, The following is an example of most check items, use the checklist from your aircraft manual.

Remove all control locks, internal and external, if installed.
Check condition of elevator, rudder, trim tabs, hinge bolts and actuator rods.
Check static pressure holes for obstruction.
Check baggage compartment and door.
Check ailerons in same manor as elevator.

, (Use your aircraft check list).

Landing gear switch in down position. (Before turning power on).
Elevator and aileron trimmed for takeoff.
Check throttle friction knobs for proper friction.
Set mixture to full rich.
Prop controls to full forward.
Set flaps at recommend position, some use 10degrees. Check your manual. (Do not confuse flap switch with landing gear switch).
Fuel selector valves set to main tank.
Carburetor heat, to cold (Full forward).
Check fuel gauges for sufficient fuel.
Boost pumps on.
Controls free and movement correct.
Cowl flaps open.

,

Check all 4 fuel gauges for full tank, if appropriate.
The 310 has 4 fuel tanks, two 50 gal. wing tip tanks and two 15 gallon (56.8 L). aux tanks, giving you a possible range of 1000 miles.
The total fuel weight is 1170 lbs. so beware of over loading the aircraft. You may have to leave some fuel behind.

, (If in a clear area). Follow your aircraft manual.

Start the left engine first since the battery is located there.
Start the right engine.
Check both engine instruments in the green.
Altimeter set to field elevation.
Gyros set.
Doors and windows properly locked.
Seat belts on, including passengers. (No passengers allowed until getting your Multiengine Certificate.

,

A 310 run-up will be the same as a complex single engine run-up, per engine.
Check magnetos, carburetor heat, Prop controls, per your 310 aircraft manual.

,

Before taking off from any airport in any aircraft, calculate the required runway length for your aircraft, fully loaded. See your aircraft manual.
With a multiengine aircraft, you have to check, not only the required runway length, but the ""Start-Stop"" distance for your aircraft.
Start-Stop distance is the distance required, for this aircraft to accelerate at full speed to VMC, then bring the aircraft to a full stop on the runway. The distance should be approximately 2400 feet of runway in the average 310.
Some pilots like to double this number to 5000 feet and use that as the minimum runway for this aircraft.
Single Engine Service Ceiling of a later model turbo 310 is approximately 17000 ft., but, an early model 310 is only about 7700 ft. Check your manual and memorize your maximum service ceiling. Best not to land at an airport elevation above 7000 ft. if you have an early model 310.

,

Apply both mixture controls to maximum, or as stated in your manual.
Apply both propeller controls to maximum, or as stated in your manual.
Apply both throttle controls to maximum, or as stated in your manual.
Stay on runway center line with rudder as required.
Verify max propeller to be at least 2600 RPM, or as per manual.
Check engine gauges are in the green, as required.
Watch airspeed for VMC (Velocity Minimum Control),
Do not rotate until VMC, 96knots, or as required.

, (If you need to clear a 50 ft. obstacle, use Best-angle-of-Climb.

Maintain Best-Rate-of-climb,106 knots.
Establish stabilized climb at 106 knots, Verify rate at least 500 fpm, vertical climb indicator.
Once positive climb is established, Gear up, ease flaps up (If any flap used).
Maintain climb at 25 inches Manifold Pressure at 2400 RPM until reaching desired altitude.

,

Lower nose slightly and reduce power, throttle, to 23 inches manifold pressure.
Set prop control to 2300 RPM for best cruise power of 65% power.
Maintain this power setting and hold altitude with small adjustments of yoke and throttle.
Trim as desired to maintain cruise altitude.

, You'll be tested by an FAA Inspector on engine out recognition and recovery.

Have your instructor walk you through engine out procedures, first at a safe altitude.
The instructor will show you how to tell which engine failed and how to fly the aircraft on one engine.
The instructor may kill one engine when you least expect it.
You'll have to demonstrate your ability to perform the following procedures.

,

The cockpit will suddenly get a little quieter and the aircraft will yaw in the direction of the dead engine. This is more difficult at night.
Practice this, at a safe altitude, and at night. Try using needle ball, it may help by showing the sudden change of yaw.

,

First verify the throttles are both on full power, both prop controls in full forward, and mixtures in full rich.
Some pilots use the ""Dead Foot Dead Engine"" procedure. Meaning, if the left engine failed, you'll have to push a lot of right rudder to fly straight, if left foot isn't needed, then the left engine must be dead.
Some say, ""That's simple, the prop will stop and the RPM will drop"".
Well, in actuality, the prop continues to spin at the same RPM.
A windmilling prop has the same drag as a solid disk of the same diameter so you need to get the prop feathered and stopped immediately.

,

Now that you've identified the dead engine, verify full power is applied to the good engine.

,

Reduce the drag from the bad engine prop by putting the prop into feather position. (Prop Control all the way back).
Feathering puts the prop edgeways to the wind to eliminate drag, and stop the prop from rotating.
You don't need the extreme drag of a windmilling prop which will cause the aircraft to be un-controllable.

,

Get the aircraft flying straight ahead with no loss of altitude.
Try to maintain straight ahead flight. Raising the dead engine side wing higher to balance out the good engine power and dead engine drag and yaw conditions.
Always practice dead engine procedures at a safe altitude.
Always hold the dead engine wing high until landing (but, Only if you really have a dead engine).

,


ADS-B, or (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast), is a cornerstone of Next Generation air traffic modernization.
Mandated soon by the FAA for all aircraft operating in airspace that now requires a Mode C transponder must be equipped with ADS-B.
This new system, when properly installed and operated, will allow the pilot to see, and be seen, and avoid all other aircraft in the vicinity.
In addition to aircraft traffic, in flight services and weather information can also be sent to the pilot in flight.

Cultivate gratitude.",How to Benefit from Power Yoga," Whatever your level, yoga starts with breathing. Breathing properly will help you keep your rhythm throughout your practice, know your limits and maintain good habits. When your breathing and your asanas (poses) are in perfect sync, you'll really feel the flow of power yoga.


It is common to hold your breath or use short, shallow breathing when exercising or holding a pose. However, this causes body tension and stress, the opposite of what you want while practicing yoga.There are multiple ways to breathe during poses, depending on the teacher. Find a proper breathing method that works for you.
Most yogic traditions recommend deep, belly breathing as a foundation. This type of breathing causes your abdomen to rise as you inhale and lower as you exhale. You inhale and exhale through your nose slowly, while counting seconds silently—inhale for 5 counts and exhale for 5 more before starting a new breath.
Paying attention to your breathing helps you stay focused and relaxed when you practice yoga.;
, Power yoga has roots in Ashtanga Yoga practices, which utilizes “the victorious breath” technique for breath control. Breathing this way utilizes sound and movement with exercises to promote wellbeing. First, sit down with a straight spine and eyes closed.


Take a deep breath slowly through your nose. Exhale through your mouth. Make the sound: “HAAA”. Next time you exhale, close your mouth and make the same sound in your throat.
Keep your throat relaxed and inhale while generating the same sound. It might sound a little like Dark Vader from Star Wars!
Now lift your arms when you inhale. Lower your arms when you exhale. Rest your hands in your lap and breathe. Repeat.
Return to normal breathing when you are finished. After practice, you will be able to use this breathing technique as you perform poses. It's beneficial for the body because it helps muscles get oxygen more efficiently and allows you do to more physically without fatiguing.

, The act of doing yoga is a form of meditation that requires intense concentration. It is best to practice a basic meditation to prepare you for other forms. Meditation reduces blood pressure, anxiety, insomnia, depression and flu infections.Find a comfortable place. You can lay down or sit—it doesn’t matter as long as you are comfortable. Close your eyes and pay attention to your breathing. Breathe in for 5 seconds and out for 5 seconds.
Clear your mind or focus on a particular sound, object, word or phrase. You could also imagine a place that makes you happy—such as a beach, an old memory or an imagined place.
Whenever your mind drifts to other thoughts, gently bring it back to whatever it is you have chosen to focus on.
Meditate for as long as you want—a few minutes to an hour or longer. There will be a lot of distractions at first but soon you will find it easier and easier to meditate for longer periods of time.

, You might want to do power yoga first thing in the morning, when an energetic routine is most likely to get you going for the rest of the day. Try pairing that practice with a very short, relaxing routine at night if you can. Even just a few poses may help you sleep and set the tone for the next morning.


Start each practice with some slow, easy breaths. Sit up straight with your body still. Begin the ujjayi pranayama by taking deeper breaths and exhaling through the nose. Your breathing should be audible in the back of the throat. As you move, try to match each movement to an inhale or exhale.

, Many students who pick a power yoga class or home practice do so because they're hoping to achieve health benefits along with an aerobic workout. Power yoga offers these things, but it's important to remember that the benefits of yoga accrue slowly, over time. Don't get frustrated if you need to pause in a class and rest in child's pose or another pose.


Modify poses that are difficult for you. You will learn to do them correctly in time. It's better to complete a practice performing only half the poses than to give up halfway through.

, Decide what you're looking for and set gradual, incremental goals. It may be helpful to start with a short class and easy poses, then work your way up to avoid burnout.


Before you select a class, DVD or audio home practice, figure out what you want to get out of power yoga. Are you looking for aerobic exercise? Strength training? Increased flexibility? Mental ease? This will determine what steps you take to work toward your goal in the time frame you want.

, Once you've identified your goals, look for a class that meets those needs. Think about your personality as well when selecting how you're going to practice power yoga.


If it's hard for you to make yourself practice, having a friend come over to do yoga together may make you honest and less likely to skip than alone or with a group.
If you're worried about injury or don't know proper alignment yet, you'll probably want to practice with a teacher. Guidance can be crucial as you learn the basics of power yoga and get the most out of its benefits.
If budget is a concern or you want to practice at home, there are many audio and DVD classes available. Some people prefer to do power yoga solo, which is perfectly fine too.
Specialty classes target strength, flexibility, weight loss and other goals. You can even find classes for pregnant women, larger bodies, runners, cyclists and many other groups. Don't be afraid to shop around and try different things until something ""feels right"".

, If you picked power yoga because you lose patience easily, you may not want to take beginning classes. Spend some time learning the poses and proper alignment first, then head to an advanced beginner or intermediate class that gets into vinyasa (matching breath to movement) right away. Many beginner classes start rather slowly as they explain each pose and demonstrate proper form.

, If you like to be busy, you probably selected power yoga because it feels less challenging than a slower, more meditative class. However, after every challenging workout, don't forget to spend at least five minutes in savasana, meditating to maximize benefits:


Lie flat on your back, legs slightly apart, palms facing up at your sides.
Let your feet fall open and your eyes close.
Breathe deeply and concentrate on your breath. This asana is more beneficial than all the others combined, and is a great time to soak in the benefits of your challenging practice.

, This is “the mountain pose” and is a starter pose for most standing positions. It is useful to practice this pose in order to learn more difficult poses later on.


You can include dumbbells into your poses to really get a workout. It is not a requirement, however, as Power Yoga alone is a great workout on its own.
You will need to stand up with your hands at your sides, back straight. Your big toes should be touching and your heels be slightly apart. Pick up some dumbbells and hold them at your sides.
Raise your arms upwards and stretch your hands toward the ceiling as if you can touch it. At the same time, lift your body and try to balance on your toes. Remain in the pose for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Don’t forget to breathe in tandem with your movements.
Be aware that most Power Yoga workouts have little to no rests between poses.

, This pose is also called “the chair pose”. This pose, like most poses, can be performed near a wall to help keep you balanced. When you bend forward, your tailbone can touch the wall and help you maintain balance.


Stand in the starter pose, Tadasana. Inhale while you raise your arms upward, stretching, with your dumbbells. Exhale as you bend your knees like you are going to sit in a car.
Keep your thighs parallel to the floor and your upper body leaning slightly at a right angle to your thighs. Hold the pose for 30 seconds to1 minute.
Inhale and straighten your knees. As you exhale, move your arms back to your sides into the starting position.

, This is the “triangle pose” and requires you to keep your eyes open to maintain balance. It can be challenging but has many benefits because it affects multiple areas of the body. Like the other poses, you will start out in Tadasana.


Separate your feet about 4 ft. apart, or to whatever distance is comfortable. Hold barbells, if desired. Turn your right foot out about 90 degrees while your left foot is slightly angled in.
Inhale. While you exhale, bend your body to the right side, downward from your hips. Keep your waist straight and move your left arm up in the air. Move your right arm toward the floor--both arms will be in a straight line. Hold for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Repeat this pose on the left side.

, This is “the warrior pose” and has multiple pose variations. It represents the spiritual warrior as he or she faces self-ignorance in battle. Self-ignorance is considered the source of human suffering and this pose attempts to overcome it.Start out in Tadasana, then separate your feet 4 ft. Holding dumbbells, raise your arms and stretch them. Turn your right foot 90 degrees to the right side and your left foot about 45 degrees in the same direction.
Exhale and turn your upper body to the left, keeping your back straight. Bend your right knee over your ankle. Look upwards toward the ceiling.

, Balasana, “child’s pose,” is a resting pose and can be used before or after any other pose. Many people use it when they start to get tired. It stretches the hips, thighs and ankles while relieving stress as well as back or neck pain.


Sit on your heels with your big toes touching and align your knees with your hips. While you exhale, bend your upper body forward and lay on the ground with your arms alongside, palms up. Remain in the position for at least 30 seconds.

, Power Yoga does not have a set group of poses or sequence that you have to use. Explore other poses and do those that you find challenging. In time, your health will improve.

, Good nutrition nourishes your body, gives you energy, helps you concentrate, keeps your weight balanced and allows you to practice yoga effectively. Focus on natural foods, such as fruit, whole grains, seeds, nuts, beans and vegetables. Never eat your food in a rush or while in a stressful environment.Avoid processed, fried and artificial foods. These include artificial sweeteners, sugary foods like donuts, foods made from white flour and drinks like soda.
Don't eat salty, overly processed canned foods. Only eat canned food if it is naturally canned without chemical preservatives.
Avoid alcohol, tobacco and genetically engineered food. Also, don't eat foods that have been overly cooked or microwaved.

, For ethical, spiritual and health reasons, it may be beneficial for you to only eat food that does not cause harm to animals. Yoga promotes love, compassion and the concept of non-harm for all living beings, including animals. Some yoga practitioners believe that eating meat is more difficult to digest and causes disharmony and tension in the body.

, Swimming, dance, walking and pilates are all good choices to compliment your Power Yoga practice. The core strength developed in pilates, for example, can provide enhanced stability with yoga poses. You will want to do Power Yoga at least 3 times a week but adding other exercises to your weekly routine can be fun and add variety.


You may want to avoid weight training, which some feel can stiffen muscles and reduce your ability to perform yoga as well.

, Be grateful for the chance to live life and all the wonderful experiences and relationships available to you. Before you consume any food or while preparing food, remember to feel grateful for what you will be eating. Every day, before you go to bed, think over all the good things that happened to you that day. Be thankful for a roof over your head, clean water to drink, for love and kindness and anything else you can think of.

, If your aircraft is equipped with a shoulder belt, secure it beside your hip and confirm that the belt runs from your hip across to your opposite shoulder.

,, Is there anything that could present a potential hazard? Stow or jettison any articles that could cause harm to either you or the aircraft. If you are wearing eyeglasses take them off and stow them in a pocket.

, In a C172 there are two main doors, one located on each side of the aircraft.

, There is a cargo door located on the left side (if seated in a forward facing seat) of the aircraft that can be kicked out if needed. Both the front and back windows in a C172 are made out of Plexiglas, both these windows can be kicked out.

, This item will be folded into a square and placed in front of your face for cushion just prior to touchdown.

, If you are sitting in the co-pilot seat, the pilot will request at 200 feet (61.0 m). above the ground that you open your door and lock it open. Do not be worried you will not be sucked out and the door will just bang against the cabin.

Allow the auto-rotation (spin) to develop by holding the full rudder input and the back-pressure on the control column.,
Pull the throttle completely back, setting the engine to idle.

,
Apply and hold full rudder opposite to the direction of rotation.

,
Once full rudder is engaged, apply forward pressure on the control column to break the stall with a nose down attitude.

,
Hold both rudder and nose down attitude until the rotation stops.

,
Once the rotation is stopped, neutralize the rudder, level the wings, and climb back to your assigned altitude.

",How to Spin and Recover a Cessna 150,"


H – Height: make sure you are at least 4,000 feet (1,219.2 m)+ AGL (Above Ground Level). A higher altitude is safer.






A – Area: check that you are over a relatively empty area of ground.






S – Security: verify your that your seat belt and doors are secured.






E – Engine: make sure your fuel valve is set to ON, your mixture knob is set to rich (all the way in), the carb heat is pulled HOT, oil and temperature gauges are within the green limits, and that your magnetos are set to both with the master switch (red switch on left) is set to on. This can be accomplished using a “7-Up Check” which will be described in the notes.






L – Lookout: perform a gentle turn (no more than 15 degrees of bank) to the left and then the right, forming an S. This is to verify for traffic below you and around you.

The first instruction begins after the majority of the circuit has been flown and you are on final approach to the runway.,
Next a minimum of 20 degrees of flaps needs to be lowered.,
When you are short final (approximately 200 feet away from the threshold of the runway) the air speed needs to be decreased to 65 knots.,
The plane should be over top of the runway at this point approximately 10 to 15 feet (3.0 to 4.6 m) above the ground and the rpm needs to be at 1200 plus or minus 100.,Reduce the power to idle by pulling the throttle all the way out.,you should be approximately 3–5 feet (0.9–1.5 m) above the ground and in line with the center line on the runway at this point as pulling the power to idle will decrease your height.,
Begin to flare (pulling back on the control column and pitching the nose of the plane up).,
The main landing gear should touch down at this point.,Bring the flaps all the way up and put the carburetor heat back to cold.,
Continue to hold the control column back to minimize any vibrations.",How to Perform a Short Field Landing in a Cessna 150," The approach speed should be 70kts and you can control this speed by pitching either up to decrease speed or pitching down to increase speed.
, However if winds permit fully extend the flaps to 40 degrees. A guide line to go by is if the wind is more than 15 knots only take 20 degrees of flaps, if the wind is between 10 and 15 knots use 30 degrees of flaps and if the wind is less than 10 knots use 40 degrees of flaps., This can be done by further decreasing power and pitching the nose of the aircraft up by pulling back on the control column., The rpm is controlled by the throttle.,,, This will cause you to lose your remaining altitude., Apply full brakes. The brakes are applied by pushing on the tops of the rudder pedals.,, Congratulations you have successfully completed a short field landing in a Cessna 150."
"
When executing a forward slip to lose altitude, power to idle, and slow the plane to 80 knots before starting the slip.,
Pick a point far in front of you and make it your heading or target.

,
Bank into the wind.,
To recover from the slip, simultaneously release the rudder pedal and level the plane with the ailerons.

",How to Perform a Forward Slip in a Cessna 152 to Descend Rapidly," Typically flaps are not used in this situation, but consult your Pilots' Operating Handbook (POH) before deciding whether flaps are necessary.;
,, As soon as your target starts moving, apply opposite rudder in order to keep moving towards your target. (Ex. Left rudder, right aileron) Make sure the nose of the plane is low enough to keep your airspeed up. Do not apply too much aileron because you can become inverted. Do not allow the airspeed go above 80 knots because that will stress the plane. Do not allow the airspeed to drop below 60 knots because you can get into a cross-control stall and induce a spin.

Calm your nerves with a seated forward bend.,
Transition between cat and cow.,
Rest in child's pose.,
Use downward facing dog to warm yourself up.,
Release spinal tension with a standing forward bend.,
Practice breathing deeply.",How to Debloat Using Yoga1," The seated forward bend is a relatively simple stretch that provides whole-body relaxation. If your digestive troubles are related to stress or tension, this pose may help you debloat with yoga.Start from a seated position on the floor with your legs extended in front of you. You may want to place a blanket or towel under your hips to help keep you in alignment or to cushion your sitting bones.
On an exhale, raise your arms over your head and slowly hinge forward from your hips, keeping your back straight and flat. Lower yourself as far as you comfortably can to your legs. Ultimately, you may get to the point where you can recline fully with the top of your head resting against your legs and your forearms and palms against the floor.
Hold the fold for 5 to 10 deep breaths, then slowly raise your torso to a seated position on an inhale.;
, The cat-cow flow stretches and relaxes your spine as well as stretching out your torso. This relaxing exercise is done as a vinyasa flow, with a breath for each movement.Start this pose on all fours, with your knees directly below your hips and your ankles in line with your shoulders. Roll your shoulders back, allowing your shoulder blades to melt back alongside your spine.
As you inhale, arch your back, drawing your navel towards the floor and opening your chest. This is the ""cow"" position.
When you exhale, reverse the movement starting with your tail bone. Drop your tail bone towards the floor and your navel toward your spine, curving your back upward and lowering your head slightly. This is the ""cat"" position.
Repeat this flow for 10 to 15 breath cycles, feeling the stretch in your spine.

, Child's pose is the ultimate resting position in yoga, and will give you full body relaxation to calm your nervous system and help ease digestive troubles. You may want a block or pillow for your head.Start by sitting on your knees, legs wide apart and big toes touching. On an exhale, reach forward and fold over your thighs, resting your forehead on the floor and reaching out ahead of you. Keep your hips lowered against your heels.
If you're coming from all fours, slowly lower your hips back to your heels on an exhale, reaching forward with your hands as you lower.
Hold this position for at least five deep breaths. If it feels good, you can hold this gentle pose as long as you want.
If you have abdominal cramps, you can ease them by adding a twist to child's pose. Simply walk your hands to the left, hold for 10 to 15 breath cycles, then slowly move back to center and repeat on the other side., Downward facing dog engages your whole body to get your circulation flowing, while the inversion can help relax your nervous system and encourage improved digestion.If you're moving from child's pose, rise up to all fours with your legs about hip-width apart and your wrists in line with your shoulders. Your knees should be directly in line with your hips, so you make a tabletop shape.
Tuck your toes under your heels, and on an exhale lift your hips up to the ceiling. Straighten your legs as much as possible, pressing your heels towards the floor. Make sure your neck is not crunched. You can gaze through your legs or toward your navel.
Stay in downward facing dog for four or five breath cycles, thinking about lifting with each exhale and pressing down with every inhale.

, A standing forward bend helps further warm up your belly while relieving tension all the way down your spine. This also may help stimulate digestion and ease bloating.Start this position from a standing position, big toes together and heels slightly apart. You also can have your feet about hip-width apart if you find that is easier for you.
On an exhale, fold forward from your hips, engaging a core and maintaining a flat back as long as possible before you fold into yourself.
Ideally, you will end with your palms flat on the ground, fingertips in line with your toes. If you aren't that flexible yet, just fold as far as you comfortably can and rest your palms on a block, or on your shins or knees.
Hold this fold for 10 breath cycles, then on an inhale slowly rise and return to stand.

, Deep breathing has a relaxing effect on your whole body and also can help stimulate digestive processes to relieve cramps, gas, and bloating. It's most effective to take some time to get in touch with your breath both before and after you practice yoga.Come to a comfortable seated position with your back straight, heart over pelvis, shoulder blades melting down along your spine. Relax your face and neck and close your eyes or soften your gaze.
Begin by inhaling deeply through your nose, lifting your chest and expanding your belly to take in as much air as possible.
Pause after your inhale, then exhale slowly through your mouth, making a whispered ""ha"" sound in the back of your throat. With practice, you'll be able to make this relaxing sound while exhaling through your nose.
Try to clear your mind and focus on your breath. Let your awareness of the sounds around you slowly fade. Stay here for at least five minutes.

Take stock of your normal breathing.,
Lie on your back and relax the body.,
Place your hands in the right position.,
Inhale and then exhale.,
Repeat throughout the week.,
Sit down.,
Place your hands in the right positions.,
Breathe in and breathe out.",How to Do Abdominal Breathing," Before you practice abdominal breathing, pay attention to your normal patterns of breathing. Abdominal breathing should work to alter the normal pace and size of your breaths to promote relaxation.


Close your eyes and pay attention to your breathing. Try to focus slowly on your breaths and block out other stimulants like noises or smells. If possible, do this in a closed off room away from distractions.Do you breathe into your chest or abdomen? Does your breathing feel slow? Fast? Are your breaths too shallow? See if there's anything about your breathing that feels abnormal. Doing occasional abdominal breathing exercises can help regulate normal breathing.;
, Find a flat surface and lie down. You should lie down on your back with you knees slightly bent and your feet flat against the surface. If you need extra support, put a pillow under your legs to keep your knees up., Once you're lying down, you'll need to position your hands in a way that will allow you to track your breathing. Place one hand on your upper chest and the other just below your ribcage. Relax your hands as much as you can, allowing your elbows to rest on the ground, bed, or sofa., Once you're in the proper position, you can begin the breathing exercise. You'll need to inhale and exhale slowly.


Inhale through your nose. You should inhale into your abdomen, so the hand on your stomach moves upward while the hand on your chest remains as still as possible. You do not need to count but you should inhale until you cannot take in more air comfortable. As you exhale, tighten your stomach muscles. The air should be pushed out through your stomach as you exhale. Breathe through pursed lips as you let the breath out. Once again, counting is unnecessary. Just exhale until you cannot comfortably continue to breathe out.Continue this exercise for about 5 to 10 minutes., Abdominal breathing has several benefits. It strengthens your diaphragm, slows your breath rate, decreases your oxygen demand, and will eventually result in your breathing more efficiently overall. Do the exercise 3 to 4 times a day for 5 to 10 minutes, increasing the duration with time., It is probably easier for you to initially practice abdominal breathing while lying down. However, as you get better at the activity is might be more efficient do to so while sitting. If you can do deep breathing exercises sitting, you'll be able to do so while out of your house. This might be more convenient as you can practice during downtime at work.


Sit down in a comfortable, firm chair. Keep your knees bent and your shoulders and neck relaxed., As with the original exercise, you'll need to position your hands correctly. Place one hand on your chest and another hand on your lower stomach. Your hands will once again help you tell if you're breathing correctly., Once you're seated with your hands in the right position, you can begin breathing. Inhale and exhale, focus on the position of your hands as you do so.


Inhale through your nose, making sure the hand on your lower stomach rises while the hand on your chest remains relatively still. inhale until you cannot take in any more air comfortably.Contract your stomach muscles to exhale, breathing out through pursed lips.Continue this exercise for about 5 to 10 minutes."

Position yourself in a comfortable way.,
Inhale through your nose.,
Breathe deeply from the diaphragm.,
Exhale through your mouth.",How to Breathe1," You might find it easier to take deep, slow breaths if you are lying down or sitting in a comfortable chair. Try laying on your back on a blanket, sofa, or on a bed. Let your arms lay loosely at your sides. You can keep your legs straight or bend your knees slightly.You can also use pillows to support your head and knees. Just try to make yourself as comfortable as possible.;
, It is best to breathe in through your nose when doing deep breathing, or even just when you are breathing regularly. The process of breathing through your nose allows your body to filter out viruses and bacteria.To breathe through your nose, keep your mouth closed. Your automatic nervous system will continue breathing, and the breath will come through your nostrils.
Nasal breathing allows the body to warm and humidify any cold, dry air so that it's easier to absorb., To tell whether or not you are breathing into your diaphragm, put one hand on your upper chest, the other hand on your belly, just below your rib cage. Breathe in slowly through your nose until you feel your belly start to rise. Try to make sure that your chest remains still, and that it is not moving upward. When your belly is as full of air as you can comfortably make it, start to tighten your stomach muscles. This will force air slowly from your diaphragm and out of your lungs.The diaphragm is the large, dome-shaped muscle at the base of the lungs. When you allow your diaphragm to expand and contract to control your breathing, you'll breathe more easily and efficiently.
Breathing from the diaphragm can slow your heartbeat and lower or stabilize blood pressure.You may get tired rather quickly from this exercise, but you will soon find that the strengthened diaphragm muscle allows for increased oxygen intake and energy.

, When you exhale, part your lips slightly and push the air out of your mouth using your diaphragm to force the air up and out. You should feel your diaphragm fall as you do this. Pause for a moment after exhaling your breath and then take in another breath when you feel ready.


Try doing deep breathing for five to 20 minutes every day."

You also can hold this pose with both knees against your chest at the same time.

, Twists increase circulation to your abdomen, stimulating digestion and encouraging the release of gas to ease bloating. This twist can be done directly from Apanasana, or you can create a flow between the two poses.On your back with your right knee against your chest as in Apanasana, roll your hips to twist your right knee to the left. You can put your left hand on top of your right knee to deepen the stretch, but don't force it.
Extend your right arm out to your side from your shoulder and hold the twist for 10 breath cycles. Slowly return to center and repeat on the other side.
You also can do this twist while seated, by crossing one leg over the other and twisting your torso in the other direction., The eagle twist can increase the side-to-side flexibility in your spine, as well as loosening up your stomach and other abdominal organs to ease cramps as well as bloating.Start by lying on your back with your knees up, feet flat on the floor. Cross your left leg over your right, wrapping your left toes around the back of your right ankle to twist your legs together.
Your arms should be extended out to the sides from your shoulder, with your palms facing up and your elbows at 90-degree angles, so your hands are on either side of your head.
On an exhale, lower both knees to the left slowly. Try to rest them on the floor, but take care to keep your shoulders pressed to the floor. Turn your head to the right.
Hold the twist for at least 10 breath cycles. With every exhale, try to deepen the twist a little more. Feel the stretch in your spine.

, The bridge pose increases blood flow to your abdomen and strengthens your abdominal muscles to ease cramps and aid in digestion. You can make a vinyasa of this pose or you can simply hold it for five breaths, then release.Start by lying on your back with your arms down your sides and your shoulder blades tucked under and into your back. Your feet should be flat on the floor near your fingertips, knees bent.
On an inhale, lift your hips up toward the sky, your chest toward your chin. Make sure your neck is soft and not crunched. On an exhale, slowly lower your hips to the floor.
You also can alternate hips to better stimulate and massage your digestive system.

, The twisting and bending detoxifies and stimulates your intestinal tract to help alleviate bloating. If you're not as flexible, you may need to use a yoga block or other prop to maintain proper alignment in this pose.Come to a stand and walk or jump your feet wide apart. Turn your right toes out to the right and straighten your right leg. Your left leg should remain facing forward. You may even want to turn your left foot inward so you're a little pigeon-toed, for some extra stability.
On an exhale, slowly lower your right arm towards the floor, taking care to keep your back neutral and in line with your pelvis, rather than folding forward. You can rest your right hand on the floor, or on a block or your shin.
Lift your left arm up towards the ceiling, forming a straight line from the tips of your right fingers to the tips of your left fingers. Stay in this position for five breath cycles, lifting with every inhale and deepening the twist with every exhale. Keep your neck long and soft.
On an inhale, slowly lift back to center and repeat on the other side.

, The bow pose will stretch your torso as well as strengthening your abdominal muscles to massage your intestinal organs and help you debloat. Do not do this pose if you cannot breathe through it.Start this pose lying on your belly. Bend your knees and reach back to grab each of your ankles. Point or flex your feet and lift off the floor as high as you can, shifting your weight forward. The arch point should be your navel, not your pelvis. Curve your back and open your chest.
Hold this pose for five smooth, deep breaths if you can. If your breath is shaky or you find yourself holding your breath, allow yourself to recline back to your belly.

, These three poses combined together with a breath for each movement will really get the blood flowing to your abdomen and massage your abdominal organs to get your digestion moving.Start on all fours with your knees hip-width apart and your hands directly below your shoulders. On an exhale, lift your hips toward the ceiling and press up into downward facing dog.

Clench your fist when you breathe.,
Sigh as you exhale.,
Visualize your breath.,
Practice pursed lip breathing.,
Try to breathe slowly to prevent a panic attack.,
Use the 7-11 breathing pattern to stop hyperventilating.",How to Breathe2," Clenching your fists and pumping your arms while you breathe can help to increase your oxygen intake and stimulate your circulation.Start by standing with your arms at your sides.


As you take in a breath, clench your fists tightly and begin to raise your arms out in front of you.
Then, bring your fists towards your shoulders as you exhale the breath.
Take in another breath and straighten out your arms out in front of you again, keeping your fists clenched.
Then, exhale as you bring your fists to your shoulders.
Keep repeating this exercise for several minutes.

, Sighing when you exhale can help you to relax.To sigh on your exhales, take in a deep breath through your nose and then open your mouth wide just before you exhale. Exhale the breath out of your mouth with a bit of force.


Try saying “ahhhhh” as you exhale the breath.
Repeat the sighing breath several times when you need to relax.

, Imagining what your breath looks like and where it is in your body can also help to deepen your relaxation as you breathe. Close your eyes before you start breathing. You may also want to sit or lie down in a comfortable spot.As you breathe, imagine that the air coming into your body is bright white.
Imagine the air flowing to every part of your body and bringing energy to your limbs and organs as you inhale.
As you exhale, imagine black air coming out of your body and taking all of the fatigue and negative energy away with it.
Repeat this exercise for about five to 10 minutes.

, Pursed lip breathing can help you slow your breathing process, calm down, and relax. Whenever you're feeling short of breath, try to breathe using this technique.First, find a comfortable seated position. If you are in a chair, keep both feet on the floor.
Breathe in slowly through your nose as you count to two.
Feel your diaphragm expand, and your belly rise, as you inhale. You may feel your rib cage gently expanding.
Bend your lips into an O-shape, as if you were going to direct your breath towards blowing out a candle.
Breathe out through your mouth as you count to four.
As you continue to breathe in this method, you can change the counts, gradually increasing the lengths of your inhales and exhales.

, One of the best ways to calm yourself before a panic attack is to control your breathing. To do this, take a long slow breath. Fill your lower lungs with air, then fill your upper lungs with air. When your lungs are as full as they can be, hold your breath as you mentally count to three. Then slowly exhale your breath through pursed lips.As you exhale, try to relax the muscles in your face, chest, jaws and shoulders. It might help you to tense each of these muscles groups one by one and then release the muscles.
You can use this breathing technique any time you start to feel anxious.

, Breathing too quickly, or hyperventilating, can sometimes feel similar to breathing too little. Both conditions are associated with panic disorders or social phobias.To calm yourself, bring your breath back to a healthy rate of speed by using the 7-11 breathing pattern. Close your eyes, and breathe in through your nose for a count of seven. Pause, then breathe out for a count of 11. Pause at the end of the breath, and repeat.
Hyperventilation is usually a result of chest breathing, rather than diaphragm breathing. Taking slow, deep breaths from the diaphragm, with longer exhales than inhales, can restore your breath.
Practicing this style of breathing will help your overall anxiety level. You might find that you start breathing this way without thinking about it when you start to feel anxious.

Reduce your exposure to irritants.,
Avoid exposure to allergens.,
Exercise regularly.,
Keep your airways clear.,
Lose weight if you are overweight.,
Take care of your immune system.,
Avoid exertion at high elevations.,
See your doctor if you are struggling to breathe.",How to Breathe3," Smoke, dust, chemical fumes, and other irritants can affect your breathing. If you are often exposed to these irritants, then this may be affecting your breathing. Some things you can do to reduce the irritants in your home include:Minimizing your time outdoors when air quality is poor. Air pollution will be worse outside than inside.

Quitting smoking if you are a smoker.
Ensuring that your home is well-ventilated when you clean with chemicals, such as by opening a window and running a fan.
Using an air purifier to remove airborne irritants in your home, such as dust and mold.

, Allergens can also make it harder for you to breathe. Stay indoors on dry, sunny days that tend to be higher in allergens, and more time outside just after the rain. Avoid chores outside that provoke allergies, like mowing the grass or pulling weeds. Dry your clothes in a dryer rather than hanging them on the line, where they can get filled with pollen.When pollen counts are high, keep your doors and windows closed. Use air conditioning, and a dehumidifier.
Avoid outdoor activity in the hours of the early morning, as pollen counts are generally highest at this time.
Seasonal or chronic allergies may require help from an allergy specialist.
If you're allergic to pets, avoid spending time in areas where pets are or have been. Use a vacuum with a HEPA filter to clean pet areas. This may help you avoid difficulty breathing as a result of exposure to pet dander.

, Getting regular exercise can help to improve your lung capacity and make breathing easier in general; however, this can be hard to start if you find it difficult to breathe. Talk with your doctor about some safe exercise options for your current fitness level.You might just start with short walks around your home or neighborhood.


Make sure that you breathe correctly during exercise. It's important to maintain controlled breathing while exercising so that your muscles remain fully oxygenated. Avoid holding your breath at any time during exercise.
If you start to feel fatigued when exercising, check your breathing. If you're not breathing properly, you'll become tired more quickly.

, It can be hard to breathe properly if you have a stuffy nose or phlegm in your throat. Try to keep your airways as clear as possible to improve your breathing.Blow your nose or spit to remove minor congestion.
If you have a cold, then try using a mentholated chest rub to help open up your airways, such as Vicks VapoRub.
You can also take a decongestant for severe congestion due to a cold.
Talk to your doctor if having blocked airways is a regular problem for you. You may require prescription medicine to treat the problem.

, Being overweight can also make it harder to breathe.If you are overweight, then losing some weight may help to ease your breathing. To lose weight, you will need to reduce your caloric intake and increase your activity level.


Excess fat across the abdominal area can cause breathing difficulties by pushing on the diaphragm and chest wall, making it harder for the lungs to fill with air.
Being overweight can also result in greater difficulty breathing when exercising.
Talk to your doctor for help constructing a weight loss program to suit your needs.

, Allowing yourself to feel tired or ""run down"" without attending to the underlying issues can weaken and damage your immune system. Maintaining a healthy weight, getting plenty of sleep, and staying hydrated are all ways that you can help take care of your immune system.Don't smoke. If you are a smoker, talk to your doctor about how to quit. Stay away from passive (second-hand) smoking.
Eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Avoid eating too much saturated fat, sugar or sodium.
Drink alcohol only in moderation, or abstain altogether.

, If you find yourself in locations higher than 5,000 feet (1,524 meters), you'll notice that you may have difficulty breathing. This is because there's less oxygen found in higher altitudes, and your body must work twice as hard to get the same amount. This leads to breathlessness, dizziness and fatigue associated with altitude sickness.Your body should be able to adjust to the higher elevations within a few days. Drink plenty of water, and avoid exercise until you've adapted.
If you're traveling to a high-altitude location, your doctor may prescribe a medication to help you avoid altitude sickness.

, If you are having trouble breathing and you do not know why, then see your doctor as soon as possible.Difficulty breathing may indicate that you have a serious condition, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. Your doctor can provide you with a diagnosis and treatment options.

Breathe through your nose.,
Breathe through your diaphragm.,
Breathe rhythmically.,
Maintain an upright posture.,
Breathe slowly.",How to Breathe Better,"  While this may seem obvious, most people do not do it all that often.  Breathing through your nose has many advantages to it, the most important one being the filtering ability of your nose.  When you breathe through your mouth, you will automatically inhale cold, unfiltered air that is full of different viruses and bacteria, but most of these get filtered when you breath through the nose.;
,  The air is not automatically sucked into your stomach, it actually requires lots of muscles to do so, such as the diaphragm, abdomen, chest, neck and shoulders.  70-80% of your breathing should be done by the diaphragm.  This has many advantages, with some of them being.


The pressure in your chest is decreased, preventing the heart from working as hard
It is much more efficient than breathing with youre other muscles, because the more effective muscles come into use

,  Everything in our body has a naturel rhythm, and breathing is no different. The hormones in our body follow a natural rhythm, and when you breathe rhythmically, you will find your breathing being in tune with your bod, providing a better and more efficient breathing.

,  When you are standing/ sitting with a straight back, your diaphragm will have more space to breath, eventually leading to a more efficient breathing (refer to step 2).  An upright position also helps you to breathe through your nose more easily.

,  Slow breathing will lead to a lower heart rate and blood pressure, and also feeling more relaxed and entering a ""Rest-and-Digest"" position.  Breathing at a pace of 10 or less breathes per minute will result in a better and more relaxed breathing.

Fill your cheeks with air, and breathe in and out through your nose.,
Blow out the air you have been holding in your mouth.,
Switch to exhaling using your lungs when the air in your mouth runs out.,
Fill your cheeks with air again.,
Repeat this sequence continuously.,
Practice spitting.,
Use a straw.,
Vocalize.,
Try your mouthpiece.,
Try it as soon as possible.,
Work your way up.,
Practice a little bit each day.",How to Circular Breathe," What you’re doing is establishing a second source of air that you can use when your lungs run out.While this may make you look like a chipmunk, the more useful analogy is to think of yourself as a human bagpipe, and your cheeks as the bellows.;
, Close your jaw, but make a tiny opening in your mouth, and use your cheek muscles to push the air out slowly.Continue to breathe in deeply through your nose.Control the motion so that it takes between three and five seconds to blow out the air in your mouthExperts differ somewhat on this step. Some recommend keeping your cheeks puffed out the entire time, refilling them frequently with little bits of air from the lungs.Others, however, suggest that it might be more natural to let your cheeks return to a normal breathing position as you let the air out of your mouth.Experiment with both to determine which is more comfortable—and effective—for you and your instrument.

, Since you have been breathing in through your nose the whole time, your lungs should fill up by the time the air in your mouth runs out.You can change where the air is coming from by closing your soft palate., You should do this right before your lungs run out, so you have time to fill your lungs again while you are using the air stored in your mouth., Once you are able to turn it into a seamless process, you will never have to pause to take a breath while playing your instrument again., Spitting a thin stream of water can give you a good sense of the technique, in part because water is visible while air is not. Spitting while circular breathing will also more closely replicate the force you will need to produce sound on your instrument.Fill your mouth with as much water as you can.
Breathing in and out through your nose, spit the water into the sink in a thin, continuous stream.

, Pursing your lips around a straw will mimic the embouchure (mouth position) you use to play your instrument, so this is a good way to practice. Put a straw in a glass of water, and follow the steps for circular breathing while trying to blow in such a way that produces a constant stream of bubbles., Circular breathing may have been first developed to play the didgeridoo, most often used to produce long, sustained notes. Teachers of this instrument suggest that vocalizing can lead to a smoother process.Make a strong “HA” sound when switching from the air in your cheeks to the air in your lungs.

, Blowing through a straw can help with technique, but it won’t give you any sense of how it sounds. With just your mouthpiece, you’ll know if you’re producing sound without having to worry too much about its resonance or quality.If you hear any noticeable break in the sound, you are probably waiting until one source of air is fully depleted before switching to the other one. Switch from your mouth to your lungs and vice versa the second before the one you are using runs out of air.
This exercise is also helpful because it will give you a sense of how firmly you need to hold your lips for the technique to be successful.

, Don’t wait until you have mastered the technique in practice settings to apply it to your instrument. The only way to get better at it is to do it, so add the rest of your instrument as soon as you can make a sound using just your mouthpiece., Do not start with complicated music, or with songs at all. Instead, start by holding single notes, then move on to easy, repetitive exercises. This will let you continue to perfect your technique.Some registers will make this easier than others. You may find it easier to start with exercises that hit the higher part of your instrument’s range., Circular breathing can be mentally and physically tiring at first, so you might find it hard to keep it up for long. However, this doesn't mean that you should only practice once in a while. Instead, try three daily sessions of a few minutes each while you are learning the technique."

The risk has been in modern times that in an effort to strip mindfulness practices from its traditional religious source, it has also stripped itself of many of the internal checks and balances without providing adequate compensations for these very important tools. It is wise to read widely before engaging in any practice.;
, For mindfulness to work, it is crucial to adapt your lifestyle in the beginning, as well as during the time you practice. This is a very important safeguard, but also makes the mindfulness more effective. You may balance your lifestyle by considering the following checklist.


Time: If you live a very busy life at work or school, as well as at home, it can be very difficult to practice. Dedicating some private time for your own practice, or reducing your duties will aid progress immensely. With a mind that is too busy, it can be too difficult to identify the root cause of the problem you are currently dealing with.
Perspective. If you have a positive outlook, even in times of trouble and stress, then you have an enormous advantage. If you incline towards more negative moods and perspectives, intentionally start to look for a silver lining in the situation, and ultimately a view of letting go. This in itself may seem trivial, but actually acts as a very effective way of separating yourself from an issue that may be otherwise all-consuming.
Energy. If developed well, mindfulness may give you more energy and enthusiasm as it reveals new and interesting aspects of your interactions with life and people, that can give you room for creativity and inspiration. However, it takes energy to get the ball rolling. If you are tired, then it is always better to rest, meditate or have a pamper session to recuperate. As your practice develops then these times of low energy can actually be very revealing and helpful.
Physical and Mental Health. Unfortunately, mindfulness has occasionally been mis-represented as a cure-all and for practitioners suffering from a mental condition such as paranoia, severe anxiety, severe depression or borderline personality complexes should not undertake mindfulness with the view of a quick-fix, or without qualified instruction. Physical health is also important as good health and dietary habits make the practice more easy.

, In the Buddhist tradition, the ancient word used for mindfulness also means: recognition, awareness, memory, intent and wakefulness. Simple observation or noting techniques are actually only one third of the practice, the next third is recognizing or identifying what is going on, and finally experimenting and learning about the experience so that you may then act effectively. For this reason, mindfulness is a personal journey that develops as you go.

, Wether you are busy in the moment or taking some quiet introspection time, such as meditation, look at what you feel, what you are thinking, what is going on around you.

, Some techniques involve a personal narrative, such as ""I am feeling tired"" or ""I am feeling frustrated"", but other methods are simply pure observation. Use whichever is easiest for you. Ultimately, when your practice has developed, the personal narrative is not necessary, but can still be used as you see fit. Mindfulness is not a fixed system.

, This means essentially that you don't become tied up with the experience, because the trap is creating more feelings and thoughts about existing feelings and thoughts, thus complicating your experience and making things worse! When you begin, it is best to practice on neutral or pleasant experience because it can be a much simpler way to learn how to look at things impartially, for example as you might look at a nice flower in a vase, or an article in the paper. When handling difficult situations as a beginner, take it slowly and use different skills and means such as discussing the issue with a trusted friend, or simply taking a rest so that you can deal with it later and then reflecting on what happened.

, Again, only do this when you are confident, because mindfulness techniques really start to become effective is when you feel more confident to face the experience with an open mind. The more you learn about the experience, be it a negative one; the less it will dominate you, but at the same time the more you explore a pleasant experience, you can appreciate it with far more happiness and depth of heart.

, Mindfulness in many ways is understanding your habitual ways of responding to a situation, as well as understanding the situation you are in. Sometimes it can become clear that your habitual way of response is the source of your stress, sometimes it is seeing a solution to the problem itself. By relieving yourself of expectations and pressures, you give yourself a much easier time to understand how gradually the habits can be changed, and how your own insight can be developed to give you far more freedom. As your practice develops, you may be surprised suddenly to recognize that simply by knowing what you experience had dissolved the complexity and stress in itself.

, No matter how challenging the experience, eventually an experienced practitioner recognizes the experience itself was not the enemy, nor were their emotions, sensations or thoughts the enemy. People are internally primed to fight off all conflicts without understanding that the real problem as such, was always the lack of understanding. The cause of stress is the wild, confused, habitual and frightened mind lashing out at imagined monsters, making mountains out of molehills, or wanting to change the world.

, This is an aspect of mindfulness that in its traditional form is crucial, yet often is abandoned in secular forms because many inherently reject or feel uncomfortable with the idea - which in itself is actually a telling expression of self-aversion. The kindness and compassion recognises that you don't need to fight your own mind or with other people, and that it heals the mind in a way that is both deep and groundbreaking. It can also, just by its presence, soothe and remove many internal subtle problems that were not evident at the time.

, This is a very advanced and difficult stage to manage. There will always be tragedies that are beyond resolution, so mindfulness is about recognising and accepting ones' own limitations. This in many ways relieves the pressures from a person, because when the nature of some challenges is that they can never be changed reveals that a practitioner can always do their best, but when it is beyond help it is not a failure. This is the ground of healing, of letting go of stress and moving on, without becoming trapped in the past.

, As an extension of the practice of kindness, boosting your pleasant experiences with similar feelings of joy, self worth, gratitude and generosity will reset your habitual ways of dealing with stress as well as enriching ordinary experiences. A simple cup of tea made by a loved one, or one that you made for a loved one can become a deeply wonderful moment, and a practitioner eventually inclines to looking for opportunities to make someone's day. These experiences will often overpower negative experiences and give the practitioner a deep sense of contentment and confidence.

, By reflecting often on quality states of mind and quality experiences, a skilled practitioner often shares these skills with others without even applying effort, such as being a good friend to those you know who are experiencing their own troubles, or enriching one's relationships and interactions in life. This in turn, deepens your own mindfulness and insight to living a stress free life.

Breathe deeply and steadily.,
Breathe from your belly.,
Try not to hold back air between notes.",How to Breathe when Singing1," Take a deep breath, and then let the air out at a slow, even pace. Become aware of the rhythm of your breathing, and make it a conscious exercise. Learn to quickly inhale a large volume of air, then release it gradually as you sing.This will help you hold notes longer and more powerfully.;
, You can draw a much fuller sound from your abdomen than you can from your nose or your chest. Focus on your abdomen when you sing. Let your belly expand as you inhale. Allow your stomach to shrink inward when you exhale.Imagine a ring around your stomach and waist. It expands as you inhale, and it contracts as you exhale. Let each breath move the air from the bottom of your lungs, up through your chest, and then out of your mouth.Notice the natural rising and falling of your chest. When you aren't singing, this is perfectly fine. Only worry about controlling your breath in this way while you are engaged in the act of singing.

, Some singers try to ""stop"" their voice in between inhaling and exhaling – to take a breath after a sustained note. This interrupts your flow and can actually make for less efficient singing. Instead, focus on breathing “into” your note: try to silently exhale air just before you resume singing. Take deep breaths when you have the chance, but don't let them interrupt the song.


If you are singing a pre-written song, try to take the natural breaths in the piece. If you're performing with a group, make sure to communicate with everyone else: some directors and composers are very specific as to where you breathe.

Learn how to do something new.,
Find something positive about any situation.,
Talk it through.,
Tell people when they've overstepped your boundaries.,
Smile.,
Sleep well.,

If none of the above works, see a professional.",How to Unwind," Take a day off to sort out what's bugging you and to have a rest. Nobody can keep going on full throttle without taking a break. Take a moment to sort out your thoughts - write out everything on a piece of paper or in a diary, spill in a private blog, tell your pet bird - whatever works for you, do it. Clear all your worries and problems out of your system, and out of your mind.


Organizing your daily routines can be a major step in the right direction. Give yourself enough time to properly do things without rushing so that you can enjoy things.
Find out if your job insures any paid sick days or personal days. If they do, use them!

It's recommended that you keep a record of your thoughts by writing them down because this helps you to sort through them and also gives you an anchor point for moving forward from.
Be careful what you post on the internet when using a blog, because as soon as you click send, unless you've made sure it's set for private publication only, then anything you've written becomes public. It is not a good idea to vent about the people who are bugging you in a public forum!;
, To relax, you have to actually try to relax and to give yourself the space and time to do so. Take a few deep breaths and remember that worrying will make things worse, and that you are entitled to find a centered inner place to help you go forward



Meditation will help relax both your body and mind. Take 20 deep breaths in and out for a quick mood booster. See wikiHow's various meditation articles for more good tips and tricks on meditating.
Seek meditation classes. Sometimes it's easier to learn to relax with other people.

, Lessons, a workshop, after hours learning, etc., can all provide you with an opportunity to unwind and learn more about the world and yourself at the same time. You might not think that it's possible to unwind while learning but provided it's fun and it's with people who are enthusiastic, this can be an incredible buzz and time of sheer creativity for you.

, Tired? Stressed? Being positive can make a huge difference to your feelings and your outlook on the problems in your way. Remember every con has a pro, and being negative isn't going to help you sort through the options. Acting sarcastic about everything isn't going to give you the right key to unlock solutions. Put down your umbrella and live the sunshine. Positivity is a virus everyone wants to catch, so spread it!


Be around positive people. Surrounding yourself with negative people may cause you to feel down. And that doesn't mean hanging around the laugh of the party all the time – it just means finding people who make you feel good when you're in their presence. And don't dismiss everyone who isn't upbeat – be aware that everyone gets a little down now and then over losses in their life; make your decisions about who is good to be around based on knowing people as a whole, not just from an odd occasion.
Do something small but valuable for the community. Community service makes you feel good inside, as well as being beneficial for the people you help out. It can be as simple as helping collect your neighbor's mail while they're on vacation to as involved as helping out with the local soup kitchen. Give the time you have.

Exercise! Exercising helps you to feel happy, and it is a great stress reliever. Next time you need to unwind, jog around the block or do a few laps in your pool to work off any irritation or stress.

, Talking is definitely one of the best remedies. Whether it's your spouse, your parents, your best friend or your counselor, if decisions you need to make or things you're thinking are just too hard, talk to someone you trust to help you sort through the issues. Speak to someone you know you can always trust, and who is always there for you. Sleep on your problems, and when you wake up, say what you have to say.

, Let them know that their way of treating you is not welcome, and that they should stop. Let them say their side of the story as well as expecting them to listen to yours. Accept their opinions for what they are, and remember that honesty is the best policy. However, do be considerate when being honest.

, Even when you're feeling down, smiling can make a big difference to your feelings and to other people's. Trying to be happy when someone is around can make them happy and can lighten up everyone's mood. And if a smile isn't enough, laughter is the best medicine.

, Sleeping is a way to shut down and restart your body. Forget about the external strife and rest for internal strength. Make your bed a comfortable environment by adding lots of pillows, throw a nice blanket over the top and add whatever makes you get to sleep easiest (music, reading, light/darkness, heat/cold air etc.) Have a warm bath or shower beforehand so you are refreshed, get a massage to relax and go to sleep. Pamper yourself. You don't deserve to be put under pressure. Sleep is a key point to unwinding.Know that resting gives your body some time to organize everything. Things will seem much clearer when you wake up.


Make sure to get at least seven to eight hours of sleep per night. Know your sleep needs and stick to them.
Try to get to bed earlier and wake up earlier. This can allow you space at the commencement of the day to get more things done while you're refreshed and it's quiet around you.

, Slow down and enjoy life. Going too fast will wear you out, while going top speed is guaranteed to wind you up, which defeats the purpose of your desire to unwind. Realize that it's not about how fast you can be. It's about the outcome you achieve. The outcome you're aiming for is to unwind, so relax! There's no need to rush - take note of this experience for next time.

, Any instrument, from your old piano, to a baritone saxophone, or a piccolo. An instrument requires discipline, focus, a sense of rhythm and will help you to reconnect with keeping a healthy pace with the music and ultimately, with life.

, This is important. No good human deserves to be stressed. Admitting you need to see someone is hard, but shows a lot of courage when you do. There is much relief to be gained from non-judgmental help.

, Let go of inhibitions to become more susceptible to the sensations your body experiences.


Confidence doesn't come overnight. Build yourself up each day by remembering to stay positive and optimistic.

, Your vision has been your primary sense throughout your life and is responsible for about 80% of the information your brain receives. Without the ability to rely on our vision, we become more aware of what the rest of our senses are experiencing. Give your other sense the opportunity to interpret your environment., Notice every sound and try to judge the distance it's traveling to reach you. Isolate individual sounds like a bird singing. Try following two individual sounds separately.Listen to music with headphones. For a bigger challenge, listen with two sets of headphones and a different song in each ear. Try to follow each song separately.
Listen to music you love. Ask yourself why you love it.

, While your sense of taste and smell are controlled by separate receptor organs, the two senses are entwined and responsible for how your brain perceives taste.Let your eyes close during each bite. Chew slowly and focus on the taste, texture, and smell.
Seek out aromas that you enjoy. Bake some cookies or light a scented candle.
Add different herbs and spices to your meals and try to single them out by their taste.

, Your skin is your largest organ and is responsible for giving you important information about your environment. Your skin keeps you updated on different temperatures, textures, pressure, vibrations, and more. Seek out activities that target your sense of touch.Enjoy your favorite fabric and pay attention to the texture.
Relax in a warm bath or shower.
Get a massage.

, You won't have time to indulge in your senses if you are rushing around trying to get to work. Give yourself an extra fifteen minutes in the morning to savor that cup of coffee.

, You have probably brought some of your favorite things home with you already. Now, you just need to give yourself a chance to really enjoy that new sound system or scented candle by using it! As you become more attuned to your senses, you will naturally create time to pursue them.

, The simple presence of your phone is distracting enough.Texting or checking emails can give you tunnel vision and block out your senses. If you find yourself reaching for your phone, look around you instead. Notice the color of the bartender’s eyes, or the texture of the chair you are sitting on. Listen to the sounds in your environment. Become aware of as many things around you as possible.

, Let go of mental stress and take some personal time away from thoughts of work or your social life. Pamper your body with a massage or a long soothing bath. Enjoy your favorite scented lotions and wrap up in your favorite fabric. Treat your body to a special day of rest and relaxation.Letting go of stress will allow you to enjoy your senses more.

, Trying new things is a great way to awaken your senses. Give yourself the opportunity to expand on the things that your senses enjoy.Listen to different types music. Attend a live concert. Visit an art museum and pretend you can take a painting home with you. Which one would it be?
Spend time in the great outdoors. Visit a new city or a national park. Go on a camping trip. Take a vacation dedicated to your senses.
Try a new restaurant, go wine tasting, or visit a local farmers market and bring home ingredients for a home cooked meal. Savor each bite. Pure enjoyment and gratitude is the key.

, Remember, being sensuous doesn't have to mean being sexual. Physical contact has the power to create a stronger bond between you and your partner, friend, or child.Our sense of touch is the first one we acquire and we pick up a lot of emotional queues through touch.


Embrace your friends. Physical contact with your friends can build trust and enhance lasting relationships.Touch your partner. When you kiss them, linger. Hold their hand when you walk together and caress their fingers. Let yourself enjoy the contact. You may be surprised at the bond it builds between you.
Ruffle your hands through your childs hair. Hug them when you see them. Physical contact with children has been shown to increase their developmental abilities., Look into someones eyes when you see them and hold the contact. Simple eye contact has the power to stimulate love and affection.Keep your eyes warm. Smile. You may be surprised at how many people will smile back.

, Often we are moving too quickly to “stop and smell the roses."" Indulging in your senses can be a great therapy to reduce stress.You will become more sensuous as you notice more things about the world around you.


Slowing down doesn't have to mean spending more time. Use the time you have to focus on the physical aspects of your environment rather than the intellectual ones.
Savor the taste of your coffee or notice the new outfit your friend is wearing. Run your hand down your partners face and let yourself simply enjoy being in their company without any obligations.

Hold yourself upright.,
Keep your head up.,
Shift your weight slightly forward.,
Open your mouth wider when you sing.",How to Breathe when Singing2," Push your chest out and keep your shoulders back. Relax, but do not slouch forward. Be confident. Consciously hold your shoulders back, and catch yourself when they hunch up around your ears. Let your shoulders pull your chest up, slightly, making room for your lungs to hold more air.Don’t force it. Control your posture, but not so much that you are rigid. Keep your shoulders as far back as possible, but don't make yourself uncomfortable.
Flatten your belly, but do not flex your abdominal muscles. Be upright, but relaxed. Do not bend forwards or backwards from the waist. Stand up straight so that your shoulders are above your ankles.

, Gaze straight forward so that your chin is parallel to the floor. Avoid looking up or down when you sing, lest you constrict your vocal chords and limit your range. Try to keep your throat as open and straight as possible – do not twist or stretch your neck out of its natural position.

, Stand with your feet about six inches apart, toes facing forward. Place one foot slightly further forward than the other. Rest on the heels and soles of your feet, and make sure that you are stable.Keep your knees and your elbows slightly bent. Let yourself relax into a comfortable and natural singing position.

, Many singers let their mouths close slightly as they sing, which can muffle the effect. Less space in your mouth means less sound coming out of your mouth. Open your mouth to lend resonance to your voice!Use the ""two finger rule"" as a litmus. When you are singing open vowels like ""ah"" and ""oh,"" try to fit two fingers between your teeth. If you can fit two fingers between your teeth, then your mouth is open wide enough. If you can’t fit two fingers: open your mouth wider.

Exit your meditation.",How to Rest with Your Eyes Open," This can either be sitting up or lying down. The only rule is that you must be comfortable. How you achieve that is totally up to you.


As much as possible, refrain from moving around or squirming while meditating.
You may want to purchase a travel pillow or a blanket to make you more comfortable, if possible.;
, Although the goal is to rest with your eyes open, you'll find it much easier to commit to the meditation if you keep your eyes half-closed. It helps block out distractions and will prevent your eyes from getting tired/stinging from being open too long.

, We’ve all stared into space until our world blurs and we’re not really “seeing” anything anymore. This is the state you want to achieve, so as much as you can, try not to register the objects, noises or smells around you. This may be difficult at first, but the more you practice, the decision to ignore your surroundings becomes more natural and, eventually, second nature.


Try to focus on a single object. Choose something small and unmoving like a crack in the wall or a flower in a vase. You can even choose something with no definable characteristics, like a plain white wall or floor. Once you've stared at it long enough, your eyes should begin to glaze over and just like that, you've shut out external influences.
Another method is to try focusing on your breathing. This practice includes ""belly breathing,"" meaning you draw your breath into your abdomen, not your chest. Rest your hands on your stomach and try to lift them by filling your belly with a deep breath. Then feel them lower as you exhale. This type of breathing (diaphragmatic) can stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, which can relax you.

, Try not to think about your worries or frustrations, your fears, or what you're excited about doing this coming week or weekend. Let that all float away as you stare as mindlessly as possible at that object.


""Clearing your mind"" is not as easy as it sounds, and you may become frustrated if you become fixated on this idea. If you find yourself starting to worry, that's okay. Just gently bring your awareness back to your breathing. This is part of what is known as mindful (or mindfulness) meditation.

, Imagine a quiet and motionless place, such as a deserted beach or mountaintop. Fill in all of the details: the sights, sounds, and smells. Soon enough, this peaceful image will replace the world around you and leave you feeling relaxed and refreshed.There are tons of guided meditation videos and audio to be found online. Try searching for ""guided imagery"" on YouTube. Pick a video, plug in your headphones, and zone out while you listen (you don't need to actually watch the video).

, Another method of relaxation meditation involves making a conscious effort to relax your muscles. Begin with your toes, focusing solely on their physical state. Try tensing them for five seconds, then releasing. You want them to feel loose and tension-free.


Slowly work your way through each muscle in your body. Move from your toes to your feet, then your ankles, your calves, and so on. Try to pinpoint areas where you feel tense or tight, then consciously try to let go of that tension.
By the time you reach the top of your head, your entire body should feel loose and relaxed.
This is therapeutic technique that can be used to treat anxiety and nervousness.

, It’s important to slowly work your way back to complete wakefulness. You can do so by acknowledging outside stimuli a little at a time (e.g. wind in the trees, distant music).


Once you've roused yourself fully, take a quick moment to acknowledge how peaceful the meditation experience was. Now that you've ""closed"" your rest this way, you can get back into your day with a new sense of energy and resolve.

, Zazen is a form of meditation that's traditionally done in Zen Buddhist temples or monasteries, but you can try it in any quiet location.


Try sitting in a room by yourself, or positioning yourself outside (if you don't find the sounds of nature too disruptive).

, On the floor, ground, or on a cushion, sit in a lotus or half-lotus position, with your knees bent and your feet resting on or near the opposite thighs. Keep your chin tucked in, head tilted down, and your eyes gazing at a point two to three feet in front of you.It’s important to keep your spine straight but relaxed and your hands folded loosely together over your belly.
You can even sit in a chair as long as you keep your spine straight, your hands folded, and your gaze on that point 2 to 3 feet in front of you.

, During zazen meditation eyes are kept half-closed so that the meditator is not influenced by outside forces but is not completely shutting them out either.

, Focus on fully expanding your lungs as you breathe in and deflating them as much as possible when you exhale.

, ""Nonthinkingness"" is the concept of remaining in the present moment and not dwelling on anything for too long. Try to imagine the world passing you by slowly and acknowledging what's happening without letting it affect your own sense of well-being.


If you're struggling with nonthinkingness, try to focus only on your breathing. This should help you relax as other thoughts fall away from your mind.
“Nonthinkingness” is similar to practicing mindfulness in that you concentrate on breathing and relaxing without a mantra.

, Some monks practice zazen for extended periods of time, but for yourself, try starting with five- or 10-minute sessions with a goal of building up to 20 or 30 minutes. Set a timer or alarm to alert you when time is up.


Don’t feel bad if you have trouble at first. Your mind might wander, you might start thinking of other things, or you might even fall asleep. All of these are normal. Have patience and keep practicing. Eventually you’ll get it.

, Don't try to snap yourself out of meditation or hop up and get right back to work. Allow yourself to emerge slowly. You can do this by starting to notice outside stimuli (the sound of birds singing, for instance). Bring yourself back into the present moment.


Studies on Zazen meditation and the synchronization of breathing and heartbeat have suggested a high correlation between mediation and your cardio-pulmonary health. Further, these results were observed in patients that have never meditated before., Try sitting in a room by yourself or positioning yourself outside (if you don't find the natural sounds too disruptive).

, On the floor, ground, or on a cushion, sit in a lotus or half-lotus position with your knees bent and your feet resting on or near the opposite thighs. Tilt your head down and let your eyes rest about two to three feet in front of you.Keep your spine straight but not rigid. Fold your hands loosely and allow them to rest on your belly.
You can perform this meditation in a chair as well. Just make sure you sit up straight (again, keeping the spine relaxed).

, Each eye needs its own object. One should be only in the left eye’s field of vision, the other in only the right eye’s field of vision. Each object should also be stationary.Each object should be at a slightly greater than 45-degree angle from your face. This is close enough that your eyes can be in the normal position facing forward while simultaneously being able to focus individually on two separate objects, each unable to see the object on the opposite side.
For best results, make sure each object is two or three feet in front of you so you can sit, eyes half-open and chin tucked in, just as you would in a Zazen meditation position.

, Each eye is fully aware of the presence of the object in its own field of vision. As you become better practiced at this you will begin to achieve a profound sense of relaxation.


As with other forms of meditation, patience is key. It may take several attempts before your focus improves to the point that you empty your mind and achieve a heightened level of relaxation.

, Allow yourself to slowly come back to complete wakefulness. Try becoming aware of your environment a little bit at a time (the smell of someone making coffee in the other room, the sound of a clock, etc.).

Blow out the candle after the session.",How to Use Candles for Meditation," Many candles are made from toxic chemicals, such as paraffin. These release harmful vapours while the candle is lit and should not be used for candle meditation. Instead, select a candle made from a non-toxic or natural substance, such as beeswax or soy wax.;
, While meditating you will be looking at and focusing on the candle. Some people believe that certain colours can have symbolic meaning and can enhance your meditation experience. If you want to meditate for protection, purification, inner peace, spirituality, or intuition, you should use a white blue, or purple candle., If you want to focus your meditation session on love, romance, passion, power, or happiness, you should use a red or pink candle., Perhaps you want to use your meditation session to focus on prosperity and wealth. If this is the case then you should use a green candle. Green candles can also be used for fertility., Some people find that scents help them reach a deeper level of relaxation. Others; however, may be allergic or sensitive to certain scents and prefer to use a non-scented candle. Experiment with both options and choose the one that helps you focus and relax.Some scents to consider for meditation include lavender, vanilla, pine, peppermint, cinnamon, or jasmine.

, Meditation is a relaxing experience, and you want your location to match your inner state. Find a place where you won't be disturbed for the duration of the session, typically 15 to 30 minutes. Pick a room that is free of household traffic and loud noises., Before you begin meditating, dim the lights in the room and pull down the window shades. It will be much easier to focus on the candle in a dimly lit room. If the room is too bright you may experience eye strain., When you meditate, you want to clear your mind and focus solely on the candle. Turn off your phone and/or other technology that may disturb your meditation and relaxation., You should try and be completely comfortable while you are meditating. If you are wearing uncomfortable clothing, your mind may stray and focus on your discomfort. Instead, wear flowing clothes that are loose around the waist, chest, and hips., When using candles for meditation, you are supposed to keep your eyes open and look at the candle. For maximum comfort the candle should be positioned at eye level, or just below eye level. This way you will not have to strain your neck to look up or down at the candle., Place the candle approximately 20 inches (50 cm) in front of where you will be sitting. If the candle is closer to you it will appear too bright and may distract you from your meditation., It is important that you sit in a comfortable position. You can either sit in a chair with your feet firmly planted on the ground and your back straight, or cross-legged on the ground with a straight back. Your hands should be placed in a relaxed position on your lap., Some people enjoy meditating with multiple candles lit. Candles can help to create a relaxing environment for all types of meditation and prayer. Along with candle gazing meditation, you could light candles while practicing other forms of meditation, such as mindfulness meditation, guided visualization, and transcendental meditation., Once the candle is lit, gaze at the candle and let the flame occupy your mind. In the beginning your eyes may water slightly from the candle light, but this should fade throughout the session. Some people find that focusing on an object while meditating is much easier than focusing on a mantra.

, Begin your meditation by steadily breathing and staring at the flame. Let yourself become absorbed by the beauty, clarity, and purity of the light. You will find that it is actually quite easy to get lost in the flame. You will also notice that your thoughts will naturally begin to wander. Each time you catch your mind drifting, bring your thoughts back to the flame.This will help improve your focus and relaxation.

, Once you are finished meditating make sure you blow out the candle and extinguish the flame. Candles can be fire hazards and should not be left unattended. Always make sure you extinguish any candles before leaving the room."

Focus on little details.,
Focus on your breath.,
Try progressive muscle relaxation.,
Sing, play music, or chant.,
Try just sitting.",How to Slow Down Time1," There are a lot of theories about why time seems to speed up as we grow older, both subjective and scientific The neural pathways we form as children are almost always new, as each experience is new.It's as if every little detail is significant. As we get older and more familiar with the world we inhabit, however, those little details don't carry the punch they once did.


To reclaim some of the wonder of your youth, try to train yourself to focus on little things as much as possible. Take a short time each day to–yeah, literally–appreciate some flowers, or watch a sunset, or do a meditative task, like playing music or gardening.
Engage all your senses to try to be fully present, even if the event is insignificant. The smaller, the better. While you're sitting in traffic, stay focused on the temperature, the tactile feeling of your body on the seat, the smells of the car and the traffic. How strange it is to be driving at all!;
, Breath-meditation is one of the easiest and most common methods of training yourself to slow down and become more aware. Center yourself in basic breathing rituals to be more present in the moment, and slow down time.


Sit in a comfortable chair, upright, using good posture, and take a deep breath. Hold it, then exhale it slowly. Do this at least ten times while your eyes are closed. Feel the oxygen coming into your body, nourishing you, and feel it leaving your body.
Move the air you breathe to different parts of your body as you meditate. Feel it working for you.
After your ten controlled breaths are done, open your eyes and pay attention to details around you. If you are outside, look at the sky, the horizon, listen to sounds around you. If you are inside, look at the ceiling, the walls and any furniture. Be in the moment.
If you don't like the idea of ""meditating,"" just think about it as breathing. There doesn't have to be a lot of spiritual jargon wrapped up in it for it to be effective for you.

, Progressive muscle relaxation is a basic, but formalized way of relaxing your body without doing much of anything but focusing your attention on different places in your body, and pushing your presence into those places. It's a way of both relaxing and staying active, and can be a helpful way to focus yourself in a simple activity and slow time.


To start, sit upright in a comfortable chair, focusing on your breath. Then pick a part of your body, starting either at your feet or you head, and tense a muscle. Try contouring your face, as if you just ate something sour, holding it for a count of 15 seconds, then slowly releasing it and feeling the tension melt away.
Continue moving to different parts of your body, tensing muscles, holding it, and then releasing the tension slowly, until you've moved around all your body. This is an excellent way of centering yourself, being present in the moment, and relaxing.

, Another commonly used tactic of transcending time is to use a repetitive vocalization as a chant, to center yourself and to work into a kind of trance. This can be done by singing, chanting, or by playing music, and is done in lots of traditions, from Pentecostal Christians to the Hare Krishna.You can chant any single phrase, mantra, or fragment. Try chanting the Hare Krishna, or just sing Beyonce over and over: ""I'm a survivor"" is a perfectly effective mantra.
If you play an instrument, you may be very familiar with the experience of losing track of time while playing a repetitive fragment or a series of chords. Just repeat the same three notes on piano, letting them ring out slowly, and sit with the notes, focusing on your breath. Time will slow.
If you don't play, and aren't interested in chanting or singing, try listening to some soft ambient or drone-like music. Some excellent compositions for blissing out and slowing down time include William Basinski's Disintegration Loops, Jordan De La Sierra's Gymnosphere, and anything by Brian Eno.

, If you ask a Zen monk what meditation is, they will usually say, ""Just sitting."" If you ask what Zen is, again, the answer will probably be, ""Just sitting."" The big secret to meditation and to slowing time is that there is no secret to awareness. If you're feeling agitated and want to slow down time, just sit. Do nothing. Center yourself in the act of sitting, and just be.


Try to only do one thing at one time. When you're sitting, just sit. When you're reading, just read. Don't read, and eat bagels, and text your friend, and think about the weekend. Just read.

Work on breathing with your belly.,
Practice hissing.,
Correct impatient breath habits.",How to Breathe when Singing3," To start, lie on the floor with both hands on your stomach. Inhale deeply, and let the breath puff out your stomach so that your hands rise above your chest. Then, exhale gradually. Let your deflating belly carry your hands back to the starting position., Take a deep breath, then exhale a thin and steady stream of air. Inhale for 4 counts: 1, 2, 3, 4 . Then, exhale for 4 counts. Gradually push your lung capacity until you can inhale for 6 counts and exhale for 10. Make your inhalations quicker and your hisses longer until you can breathe in for one count, then exhale for 20.Try ""hiss singing"" for a few minutes in the mornings and the evenings. It's most important that you make this type of breathing into a daily practice.

, In order to sing well, you'll need to override some of the natural rhythms of your breath. It's common to make mistakes when you're trying to focus on breathing and singing at the same time. Catch yourself when you are trying to hold in too much air or trying to exhale it too quickly.

Avoid ""tanking up."" Many beginning singers try to breathe too deeply, filling up their lungs as much as possible to avoid running out of air. Don't focus on volume – focus on efficiency. Exhale as steadily as possible to preserve your air.Avoid ""pushing air."" A heightened focus on your breath might cause you to breathe out forcefully. Be sure to let the air out gradually. Take the time to focus on your breath.

Change up your routes to regular places.,
Do the same activity in a variety of locations.,
Do things that scare you.,
Explore.,
Do fewer things in a day.,
Stop multi-tasking.,
Practice systematic recall, daily.",How to Slow Down Time2," Have you ever had the experience of getting into your car and automatically driving to work, when you meant to run to the store? Repetitive actions form pathways in your brain that make it much easier to go on autopilot, performing the same task without realizing what you're doing. Those actions can speed by. So, the trick is to learn to shake up your routines to make your brain experience new things as often as possible.try to take as many different routes and methods of getting to the different places you need to go. Ride a bike sometimes, drive other times, walk other times. Find the best route for each and the worst route for each, and take all of them in between.

, Some people like to work at the same desk every day, for the same number of hours, doing the same activities. Consistency does have the effect of making time fly by. But if you want to slow it down, force yourself to go elsewhere to do tasks that you need to do repeatedly.


Don't study in your room at your desk every night, but go in a circuit. Try different rooms in your hours, try the library, try studying outside under a tree in the park. Study everywhere.
If you're a runner, don't run in the same place more than once or twice. Always explore new neighborhoods, new parks, new trails. Don't let routine become routine.

, In a recent study, a researcher asked riders on a scary thrill ride to describe how long the ride took, to plunge a couple hundred feet in a few seconds. Every participant overestimated the amount of time by roughly 30%. When we experience moments that make us nervous, moments that make us scared, time seems to drag on in a palpable way, even if it doesn't really.Try easy jump-scares, or digging out the occasional horror movie if you want to give yourself some jumps without engaging in actually risky or frightening activities. Scare yourself from the safety of your living room.
Don't engage in dangerous behaviors, but take calculated risks and put yourself out there. If it scares you to sing in front of people, take your guitar to an open mic and make yourself do it. It'll be the longest 15 minutes of your life.

, The world is a strange and beautiful place that too often we limit to a tiny skull-sized kingdom. We're at home, then we go to school or work, then we come home, and watch TV. That's a good way to make time fly by. Instead, force yourself go exploring. Explore your own neighborhood, your own world, and your own head.


How many different places can you buy a toothbrush, a sandwich, or a pair of sneakers in your own neighborhood? What's the cheapest? Where are the weirdest? Find out.
Explore your own abilities as well as your surroundings. Can you write a narrative poem? Challenge yourself. Can you play banjo? Try. Learning new things helps us reclaim that beginner's mind, which works slowly. This is the joy of exploration.

, If you want to slow down time, your goal should be to take on fewer tasks each day, and to experience each one of them fully and more completely. If you want time to slow down, slow down yourself, and slow down your rate of consuming.


Most people carry around a couple hundred hours of music on their computer, or their phone, and the instantaneous experience of access makes it hard to slow down and experience those songs. If you don't like the first thirty seconds, you can skip 'em. Try sitting with a song you really like, and listening over and over, instead of listening to an hour of Pandora.
Even if you're doing something small, like reading or looking at a book, don't try to cram the whole thing into your brain at once. Don't built up a huge stack of books at your bedside. Sit with one for a month. Sit with one poem for a year. Really experience it.

, The more you divide your attention into multiple tasks, the more difficult a time you'll have in staying focused on what you're doing, centering yourself, and slowing down the way that you're perceiving time. When you do one thing, just devote yourself to that thing until you're done with it.


Multi-tasking is usually done to ""save time"" for other things. We think, ""Hey, if I can make dinner and watch House of Cards and call my sister, I'll save time later,"" but at the end of the day, you'll hardly remember what happened on the show, the dinner will be scorched, and your sister will
Instead, focus on doing the one thing you're doing well and rightly. Make it take a long time. Make it go slowly. When you cook food, pay attention to each ingredient that you chop up. Do it right.

, At the end of each day, try a little exercise. Remember one thing you did today and describe it in as specific a detail as possible. It might be the look your friend gave you after you told a hilarious joke, or a sign you saw in someone's yard, or a particular cloud formation. Be specific, and be detailed.


After you do today, try to do yesterday. What was something, different from you you recalled yesterday, that you remember from yesterday? After you do that, go to last week. Go to a month ago. Ten years. Your childhood. try to progressively draw up specific and detailed memories from different points in your life.

",How to Prepare for Yoga Meditation," You can also do yoga meditation outside, as long as it is not noisy and in direct sunlight.;
, Yoga meditation is best done regularly at the same time, so make sure you are choosing a time that will work well most days of the week.


Many people like to do yoga meditation in the morning because the air is fresh and the mind is calm from sleeping. Other people prefer to do yoga meditation at night to rid the body of stress and relax before sleeping.

, Use the toilet, wash your hands (and feet, if you wish), and get into comfortable clothing. Eat or drink if you are hungry or thirsty. Then, wait a little while to allow your body to digest.

, Roll out your yoga mat and place blankets nearby. Focus on making it a calm space by doing 1 or all of the following:


Close doors to block out noise.
Turn the temperature up or down so you will be comfortable. If the weather is good, open a window to increase ventilation.
Light an aromatherapy candle, made of a relaxing scent. Focus as you light it, and picture it burning away negative thoughts.

, The purpose of Hatha and some other kinds of yoga is to prepare your mind for meditation. Practicing your favorite yoga poses releases tension and helps you to turn the focus inside to your breathing.


If you often do flow or Ashtanga yoga, then do 3 sun salutations to prepare for the yoga mediation.

,


Sit in a cross legged position with your knees as close to the ground as possible. If your hips are inflexible, place 1 or 2 blankets under your buttocks.
Do 10 shoulder shrugs to loosen the shoulders, lifting your shoulders up while you inhale, holding them for a second, and then releasing them on an exhale.
Roll your neck from right to left 5 times and from left to right 5 times.
Move your legs so that your knees are still bent outward and your feet are touching. Pull your feet in toward you. Bring your knees up and down for 2 minutes, in the butterfly position.
Get on your hands and knees, with hands shoulder width apart and knees hip width apart. Arch your back gently, like a cat, and hold the posture for a breath. Allow your head and pelvis to fall as you do this. Move to the opposite position, with your back flexed and your head and pelvis pointing up. Hold for a breath. Do this slowly for 2 to 3 minutes.
Sit back on your knees with the top of your feet flat on the ground. Spread your knees apart and lay down so that your head is resting on the ground. Place your hands either straight above your head with palms facing down, or straight, next to your feet with palms facing up. Stay in this baby pose for 2 to 3 minutes.

, If you are not flexible, sit in a crossed leg position on 1 or 2 blankets. Your back should be straight.


If you have a knee problem, place bolsters or blankets beneath your knees to protect them from strain.
If you have a back problem and cannot sit up straight, use pillows or blankets to find a comfortable semi-upright position, preferably with a straight spine.
Yoga meditation should not be done lying down. Although this is a relaxing position, it encourages sleep rather than concentration. Your spine should be straight and your chest should be facing up to properly perform yoga meditation.

,, Sustain the word ""Aum"" (pronounced ""Ohm"" as long as you can. This mantra focuses on purification and dissolving negativity.

, Start to do diaphragmatic, deep breathing for 2 minutes.


A good way to practice is to breathe in 3 steps for 8 seconds each. Inhale slowly, hold your breath steady and exhale slowly. Repeat for 2 minutes.
After you become familiar with breathing techniques, you can practice yoga meditation breathing that energizes the body. For example, you can do bhastrika or kapalabhati for 2 to 5 minutes before breathing deeply.

Determine if Qigong is right for you.,
Find a teacher.",How to Practice Qigong," As you prepare for Qigong, settle into a full, relaxed rhythm of breath before your begin your practice. The quality of your breath is directly related to the quality of your practice. For the vast majority of people, breath is bound by habitual patterns and stored tension.


Your goal is a state where the breath rolls in and out smoothly, like calm waves.
No rushed exhales, no gasped inhales.
However, do not force it or you will only generate a new form of tension and distract yourself from the practice.;
, It is beneficial to stretch the breath before you begin your practice, but forget about it while you practice. Stretching your breath will help you relax more and will help you commit yourself better to Qigong.


To stretch the breath start with a simple inhale for a slow count of six, hold for three, exhale for six, hold for two, repeat.
Anytime you become short of breath or tense let the pattern go until comfortable and then return to the holds.
As this becomes easier expand the breath to a count of eight, ten, etc. holding for half at the top of the inhale, a third at the bottom.
After working the breath for ten minutes or so relax into a natural rhythm again., Settling your mind is one of the most important things before you practice Qigong. If our focus is scattered, our energy will be scattered, too. In addition, settling the mind is one of the most important skills that Qigong will help you cultivate. This is a skill that will not only bring you peace, but potentially help reduce blood pressure and stress levels – prolonging your life.


Don't waste time and create tension by trying to force the mind to be silent. Instead, look for silence underneath the noise of random daily thoughts.
Focus your attention on watching your breath.
As thoughts come up, no matter how clever or seemingly prevalent, notice that you are thinking them and turn back to the breath. Gradually, the mind will become quieter.
You can settle the mind as you are stretching your breath., After mental relaxation, you need to relax your body. Bodily relaxation is key to Qigong and key to promoting good overall health. Relaxing your body, though, is a very mental activity, too. Make sure to:


Scan very slowly through the body, head to toe, releasing tension as you go.
Repeat three times.
Every part of your body should feel at ease and heavy--don't stay rigid and tensed up. Any tension or muscle anxiety should vanish. Your body should feel as if you are sinking toward the ground. , Qigong is movement and breath in unison. In general, unless specifically trained to do otherwise for certain movements or forms, you should maintain deep, relaxed, even breaths. Because the breath and movements are linked, the moves should be slow, and maintain that deeply rooted relaxation.

, Once you’ve mastered body and mind regulative techniques, you’ll be ready to start completing Qigong sets of postures. The sitting posture is one of the most common and one you can practice extremely often depending on your situation and environment. The sitting posture will improve your overall posture and promote a feeling of confidence.


Sit upright in a chair with your feet on the ground.
Your legs should be separated.
Your torso will be a right angle to your thigh.
Rest your eyes and mouth by closing them. Do not try to smile, but allow your mouth to take a natural shape., The standing posture is one that you can work on at various times throughout the day. It is a relatively easy posture to practice and master and will build on other postures and promote confidence and overall well-being.


Stand upright.
Your feet should be parallel and separated by shoulder width.
Allow your knees to bend slightly.
Raise your arms so that your hands are even to or just slightly lower than your shoulders.
Your elbows should be allowed to bend slightly.
Your hands should be about a foot length apart and your palms should be pointed downward.
Allow your fingers to be separated and slightly curved. Pretend you are holding a ball in a relaxed manner.
As with sitting posture, your eyes and mouth should be closed in a natural and unforced way., The walking posture is one you can practice in your spare time and will help relax you. The walking posture definitely requires a larger space to practice then the sitting or standing posture, so plan accordingly. When working on your walking posture, make sure to:


Always lift your feet up heel first.
Move forward with your left foot first.
Your body and hands should sway rightward as you move.
Only move forward with your right foot as your left is completely on the ground.
Practice for thirty minutes or longer., There are a wide variety of other postures you can learn and work on when practicing Qigong. Different postures will focus on different parts of the body. They will also help you hone different mental techniques and promote spiritual awareness. All of them will demand that you rely on breathing techniques and mental relaxation techniques. Consider:


The supine posture. This is a laying down posture. Lie on your back and put your legs straight out and your arms straight by your sides. This posture is intended to relax you.
The sideways lying posture. Lie on your side. Keep your upper body straight, but make sure to bend your legs slightly. Put your upper hand on your hip and your lower hand by your head. This posture is intended to relax you.
The half-lotus posture. In this posture, you will sit up. Your left foot will rest on your right thigh, which will be under your left knee. Also, make sure to rest your hands on your knees. This will stretch your legs and lower body.
The cross-legged posture. Sit upright and cross your legs. Rest your hands in front of your stomach. This will help stretch your legs and relax you., Qigong is an ancient Chinese exercise and health system that uses physical exercise, breathing, and mental techniques to promote overall health. Qigong dates back to at least 300 BCE, and probably before. Over the last 2300 years, it has developed into a complete wellness regimen with a variety of derivations and practices. Here are a few basics about Qigong:


”Qi” pronounced “chee” is often translated to mean “life force.”
Qigong is an all-encompassing approach that addresses mental, physical, and spiritual improvement.
Qigong not only improves physical health but mental and spiritual as well, as it can reduce stress and increase your ability to focus mentally., After learning about Qigong, you need to know exactly what Qigong practice entails. This will enable you to prepare for practice and to better commit yourself to the comprehensive health program that Qigong represents. Know that when you practice Qigong, you will:


Practice breathing techniques.
Practice different postures.
Meditate.
Engage yourself in guided imagery. This guided imagery will help you focus and help you put your mind on the goals you want to complete in life.
Practicing Qigong could take as little as 30 minutes a day or much longer., After you’ve learned about Qigong and know what it entails, you should think about whether Qigong is right for you. In order to figure this out, you need to think about your goals and what you want to accomplish with Qigong or in your life in general. Think about the following:


Are you solely interested in physical improvement? If so, Qigong might not be able to help you build substantial muscle tone or bulk up. However, it could be a great supplement for a larger exercise and weight-training regimen.
Do you have the time to practice Qigong? While you can practice Qigong in as little as 30 minutes a day, you’ll have to commit a decent amount of time to really understand and perfect your form and figure out how to meditate (if you have no previous experience). In addition, Qigong has its best results if you commit to practicing it over the long-term – for years.
Do you have patience? One of the most important things in determining if Qigong is right for you is your level of patience. With Qigong, results don’t come instantaneously. Instead, you’ll have to concentrate, focus, and practice in order to see results. While some results might come quickly (such as a feeling of relaxation after meditation), overall results will require work., Seek out a skilled teacher—someone who can train you on a full system. While you can learn and succeed at Qigong, teachers are extremely helpful in making sure you are perfecting certain techniques and have the knowledge to advance and master new forms.


The best teachers are those who strongly encourage individual practice.
They should also be able to offer exercises and meditations to develop the right state on being mentally and otherwise.
What you want to avoid is someone who just has a form to show you, or even a few forms. Forms are just one piece of the whole and many are of limited use unless you've done the exercises to support them.
Additionally, if the teacher spends too much time speaking about grand theory or what the form will eventually do for you, this is a negative mark. The focus should be on the practice and where you are at now. Theory is good, but avoid those who rely too heavily on words."

You might want to devote time for meditation in the mornings or before you go to bed. Remove yourself from any distractions such as your cell phone, television, or other people or things that may take your attention. Wear comfortable clothing and consider taking your shoes off. Get comfortable by either sitting or lying down. Begin to relax by focusing on your breathing and lengthening your breath.When doing the loving-kindness meditation, set aside 15-20 minutes to complete it.;
, Think of someone you love and admire. This can be a parent, romantic partner, child, or pet such as a dog or cat. Notice how you feel in your heart when you think of this person. You might feel warmth, tenderness, gentleness, or openness. As you calmly breathe, imagine a golden light extending from your heart and reaching this person’s heart, bringing them peace and happiness.As you extend the golden light, say out loud or silently to yourself, “May you be happy. May you be free from suffering. May you experience joy and ease.” Repeat this phrase again.
While you may want to start with these words, you can say whatever you want to show love and kindness to this person. You may wish to say, for example, “May you be healthy and strong. May you having loving relationships.”

, Once you’ve sent kindness to your loved one, think of a time when this person was suffering. Perhaps this person experienced an illness, injury, or difficult time in their life. Place your attention to your heart once again, and notice how you feel. Do you feel warmth, tenderness, and love? Perhaps you feel sadness or an ache in your heart. Notice these feelings. Extend the golden light once again, imagining that it is easing this person’s suffering.Silently to yourself or out loud, say, “May you be free from this suffering. May you feel joy and happiness.” Repeat this one time.

, Just as you did for the loved one, send kindness and compassion to yourself. If you experience low self-esteem, it can be difficult for you to be loving and gentle with yourself. Stay with it. Think of a time when you were suffering: perhaps you went through a difficult breakup, endured a loss, or experienced failure. Focus on how your heart feels. Do you feel sad, angry, lonely, aching, warm, open, loving, or tender? Just as you wished for your loved one’s pain to end, envision your own suffering leaving you so that you can experience more joy and happiness.As you breathe, focus on building kindness for yourself and your own suffering.Repeat the phrase, “May I be free from this suffering. May I feel joy and happiness.”

, Think about someone you feel neutral toward. This might be someone you sat next to on a bus, a grocery store clerk, a classmate, a server at a restaurant, or a co-worker you occasionally see. You should feel neither positively nor negatively toward this person.Think about how this person may suffer. Perhaps they have arguments with loved ones, struggle to pay bills, or have suffered an illness. Notice, once again, your heart and how it feels. Feel the golden light you extend begin to ease the person’s suffering.


Say to this person, “May you be free from this suffering. May you feel joy and happiness.”

, Lastly, place your focus on an enemy or someone you dislike. This might be an ex-romantic partner, parent, roommate, family member, professor, or co-worker with whom you do not get along. Despite your negative feelings for this person, think about how this person may suffer. Perhaps this person has been ill, struggles to maintain meaningful relationships, or has experienced failure. Notice how your heart feels when you think about this person’s suffering. Does it feel similar or different than when you envisioned your loved one’s suffering? Again, extend the golden light and imagine easing this person’s suffering.Say to this person, “May you be free from this suffering. May you feel joy and happiness.”

, Finally, think of all beings and the suffering they endure. Consider the people across the world in difficult living conditions, animals in the wild whose habitats have been taken over and those in factory farms. Consider all beings and notice the feeling in your heart as you reflect on the suffering across the world. Connect once again with your heart and notice what you feel when you contemplate this suffering.Just like the individuals above, say, “May all beings be free from suffering. May all beings feel joy and happiness.”
You can focus on specific populations as well, for example, all women, children, orphans, political leaders, animals, etc.

, If you’re not sure where to begin in your meditation, consider listening to an audio recording.This can help your mind stay focused and concentrate on kindness and compassion in your meditation practice. While the format stays the same each day, you get some choice as to where to place your kindness and compassion for each item.


You can search for audios and videos online to help guide you through meditations for kindness.

, If you want to meditate but have difficulty finding time or motivation to do so, enlist the help of a friend. You can use an audio or video format to guide the meditation if you’d like. This way, you can be accountable for doing the meditation and have someone to process your thoughts and feelings with afterward.


Find one day each week where you can meditate together. Find a space that feels comfortable and is convenient for both of you.

, Whether you chose to attend a spiritual meditation group or a different kind of group, you can increase your awareness and compassion in this setting. It can feel uplifting to gather with other people for a similar cause. While it can be difficult to make time to meditate on your own, it may be easier to commit to a meditation group once or twice each week. Having accountability can help increase your practice.Find a meditation group in your community that focuses on kindness. This kind of group can also help you put into action your new skills and nicer persona.

, You may want to start a meditation practice by reading certain scripts to help you focus on being nice and kind. You can follow a script to go at your own pace instead of following the pace of an audio recording or group setting. Like all other meditation practices, you’re encouraged to set aside some quiet time, get into a comfortable position, and relax before beginning the meditation., Once you’ve gotten the hang of the loving-kindness meditation, practice it in your day-to-day activities. For example, if you’re interacting with someone you dislike, imagine extending the golden light toward them and feeling compassion for their suffering. If you feel like not being nice to someone or responding to someone in a rude way, feel in your heart the way you feel during meditation.


If you come across someone that irks you, include them in that day’s meditation!

, As you meditate, keep a journal about your feelings. For example, if you practice the loving-kindness/compassion meditation, notice how it feels to send compassion to an enemy. It may be difficult at first, but notice how your feelings change over time. Do you find it easier to feel compassion for this person? Does it affect how you treat this person in real life? Has it changed how you treat other people? Write down your feelings and see how your feelings change over time. Journaling can be useful in working through feelings and solving problems.Find a journal you like and begin a practice of writing. You don’t have to write every day; instead, aim to journal every week or every few days.

, If you want to be nicer, start spending time with people. If you struggle to get along with people, notice if your interactions change.

Confront your anxieties.,
Set a time limit on worrying.,
Consider meditation.,
Do some yoga.",How to Take Your Mind off Things1," While it may seem counter intuitive, the best way to take your mind off of problems in the long term is to confront and overcome them. Otherwise, the same issues will continue to crop up and cause anxiety until they are dealt with.


Ruminating -- a tendency to replay anxious thoughts over and over in your mind -- is a mental habit that has to be broken. Begin by allowing yourself to consider the root source of your anxious thoughts. What is the scenario you fear most, and why do you worry about it?After you have identified the source of your anxiety, let yourself imagine the worst-case scenario. Often we let open-ended scenarios frighten us, when in reality we can handle the worst-case scenario. Ask yourself, what is the worst thing that can happen, and can I handle it?;
, It is impossible to force yourself to not worry about your problems, especially if the problems present real challenges to your daily life (like finances or relationships). Giving yourself a set time period each day to worry can help you find freedom the rest of the day.


Schedule 20-30 minutes at the same time every day to think about the issues that worry you. Remind yourself at other times that it is not the time to worry.Be sure your ""worry period"" is early enough in the day that it does not interfere with your sleep., Contrary to what you might see on TV, meditation doesn't have to be complicated, spooky, or mystical. Lots of ordinary people practice simple varieties of meditation to help calm their minds. Meditation is about developing the discipline to quiet or focus your mind.


Start by sitting in a comfortable, quiet room free of distractions. Sit in a position that is comfortable for you, but keep a straight back and good posture. Use a chair if you prefer.Close your eyes gently and breathe naturally in and out through your nose. Focus your attention on the way the air feels entering your nose, then your throat, then your lungs; and then on how it feels leaving again.If you find it hard to focus on your breath and your mind starts to wander, just gently redirect your thoughts back to your breath. You can do this for just a few minutes and then gradually increase the time you spend clearing your mind., Like meditation, yoga is a common but often misunderstood mind and body exercise that many people use to calm and center themselves after a long day. Like meditation, it can be relaxing and quieting, but unlike meditation it also involves a sometimes-rigorous exercise component that helps to keep you in shape and makes you actively focus on things other than whatever is bothering you.


Try investigating a yoga studio in your area. Many studios will allow you to take a class for no charge to see if it’s a good fit for you.
If you can't afford classes in a studio or gym, consider your local community center or YMCA, which often have yoga and other classes at a discount or on a pay-per-class basis.
If group classes are not right for you, purchase a DVD series or try YouTube lessons. These can be just as effective as a course in a studio, and when you learn the moves well enough, you can do them without the video.

Learn about mindfulness.,
Be aware.,
Start by taking stock of your life.,
Notice each time when you act in ways that are not in harmony with what it is you are trying to achieve.,
Bring your awareness to your breath.,
Take this a step further.,
Rest and focus.",How to Practice Mindfulness As a Way of Life," It's important to understand exactly what mindfulness is so that you can begin practicing it. Search for internet articles or critically-acclaimed books that describe how to feel mindful in the present.;
, This is a key element of being mindful. Be aware of yourself, your actions and the sensations in your body. Most time is spent time unaware of how you are feeling, or how stressed you are, and most importantly how out of touch with yourself you are.When embarking on a mindfulness journey, you are making a commitment to yourself to slow your life down, take responsibility for yourself, and to become more self-aware. This is an important first step, and usually only taken when you reach a point of despair and feel that you cannot carry on as you are.

, Write down all the things that are causing you a problem. This helps you to bring awareness to everything you are coping with.


Once you have an awareness of what is challenging you, take some time to reflect on whether they are happening for your growth or to cause you problems. Life generally brings you challenges to assist with your growth, meaning that everything you face is an opportunity to either grow and learn, or to become a victim of your circumstances.
Look at your feelings about your situation and how you are dealing with those problems/challenges. Is it helpful to you or is your response/reaction to the problems creating more problems for you? Can you think of how you can deal with them differently or more effectively?

, Once you have identified your challenges and how they are affecting you, it is easier to do this. Is there a more patient, mindful way to handle this problem? Do your actions now align with your goals, and if not, what could you do?

, Notice your natural breath. Is it shallow, deep, laboured or otherwise? Do not try to change it, just notice how it is at this time.


Next, move your attention to the area between your upper lip and nostrils; see if you can feel the breath as it enters and leaves the body in this tiny area. Try throughout the day to keep a background awareness of the breath as it enters and leaves the body.
Do you feel different when doing this? Do you feel more in control? While you are doing this, are you aware of any problems? Are you worrying about anything? Do you feel calm? It is simple to bring your attention within yourself in this way. This practice allows you to stay focused on the breath, how you are feeling, any sensations in the body and it occupies the mind in the present instead of in the past or future worries.

, Mindfulness-in-action can help your life become a living meditation. Now you are starting to become more self-aware, more aware of how you react in certain situations, it is time to bring mindfulness to your everyday activities. The purpose is to keep the mind in the present moment, focused on what you are doing now. Usually the mind is concerned with past challenges or future worries. However, when you stop and look around at this moment, what is actually happening to cause you stress or upset? Is it all happening in your mind? Wouldn't it be great to be free of that?


To assist with being in the present moment, keep a background awareness on the breath during whatever you are doing. You can bring mindfulness into all situations. Take walking for example; start by noticing each footstep, the rise and fall of the foot, the strides you take, and how it feels in your body to walk. Mostly walking is just an activity that is given no thought, however, when you bring your attention to it you can experience walking in a different way.
In the same way, you can bring mindfulness into eating, washing the dishes, cleaning, dressing, showering, driving, working, talking and any other activity you are engaged in. The purpose is to give the mind something to do in the present moment, which in turn halts the otherwise anxious and debilitating thoughts that tend to otherwise inhabit the mind.

, At the end of the day, you can greatly assist your mindfulness practice by sitting quietly with your eyes shut, and focusing on the breath. This helps to keep you calm, relaxed and it instills the new behaviour of mindfulness awareness into your consciousness.


Being mindful at first can feel strange, and unnatural, since you are focusing on things that you usually do on automatic pilot. However, the benefits are huge. You will start to become more self-aware, conscious of how you function without awareness, which can assist you with breaking the cycles of anxiety and depression.
Mindfulness can be used very effectively to identify the thoughts that cause stress, and alert you that it is time to maybe see things in a different way. Once you become aware of how your thoughts affect how you feel, react, interact and function in the world, it becomes easier to challenge them and look at things with a new perspective.

Hide your triggers.,
Go for a hike.,
Listen to music.",How to Take Your Mind off Things2," Whatever it is that is bothering you, distracting you, or stressing you out, put it somewhere out of the way for a while and ignore it.


If you just got home from work, hide your laptop, your phone, those bills that are overdue, and all the other things that you associate with working. If you just broke up with someone, clear out all the things that remind you of that person. Make it too difficult to think about the things that are bothering you.
For many people who struggle with general anxiety, avoiding television or internet news feeds can help, since the news is often sensationalized to capitalize on your worries., Spending time in a park, the woods, around a lake, or in a nearby meadow can help ground you to your surroundings, keeping your mind off troubling things. In addition to benefits to your physical health, spending time outdoors has been shown to improve concentration and increase reported levels of happiness.It's important that you don't allow your time outdoors to become a place to dwell on the issues that are bothering you. During your hikes, pause to notice the texture of the grass or the changing light on a tree or mountain, the ripples of a lake. Sets of serenity can be built in our minds and they are places where we can go more simply in our minds. Remember this.
If you find it hard to focus on your surroundings and your mind wanders back to your troubles, consider setting out on your walk or hike with a specific purpose in mind, such as collecting interesting seed pods, identifying various types of birds, or tracking wildlife. Having a task to do can help refocus your attention.

, Music is a great way to just let loose and dance, or meditate and relax. Whatever style of music you favor, listening actively can help clear your mind and leave you feeling refreshed.


Music with slow, methodical beats can put you in a meditative state and has been shown to reduce stress and anxiety much like hypnosis and meditation.Alternately, if you don't want to relax but still need a distraction, try listening to music with complicated lyrics that you'll have to follow closely. Staying closely engaged will help to keep your mind off other things. Check out Leonard Cohen, Patty Smith, Bill Callahan, or Vic Chesnutt.

Call your friends.,

, If your family and friends are busy, consider heading to a public place and just being around people. Even if you don't want to sit somewhere and try to talk to strangers, people watching can be a nice way of keeping your mind off things.


Head to the library, a coffee house, a bar, a local park, or a record store to socialize or people-watch.
While it's true that bars can be great neighborhood hangouts and places to socialize over a few drinks, drinking is not recommended as a way to distract your mind, as it can lead to serious problems with alcohol dependency. Go to the bar to socialize, not to drink your trouble away.

, If you can't have your friends come to you, send something to your friends. Write up a letter to get in touch, asking questions to help catch up and filling your friend in on your own life.


Want to go really old school? Make a mix tape and send it to a friend in the mail.

Open your eyes and try to bring the darkness into the room for five minutes.,
Understand darkness meditation takes a lot of practice.,
Reconsider darkness meditation if you have a phobia of the dark.,
Do not substitute darkness meditation for therapy.,
Try not to stay unattached after meditating.",How to Practice Darkness Meditation," Before you begin a darkness meditation routine, you'll need to assess your current feelings. Darkness can be scary, so you'll need to know where you stand going in to see what adjustments you need to make.People often think of death or negative emotions when they think of darkness. You may have been afraid of darkness as a child.
Are you frightened of the dark or of being alone? If so, you'll need to work on changing your assumptions going into the meditation routine. You want to make sure you can embrace darkness in a healthy, positive way.;
, With darkness meditation, the goal is to see darkness as less of a negative space and more as a quantitive and reflective one. Work on fostering some positive associations with darkness that will allow you to fully experience the meditation routine.Many people who practice darkness meditation feel darkness contains a lot of energy. As the womb is dark, you are born from a place of darkness. Instead of thinking of darkness as blank space, think of it as a source of life.
People often think of darkness as a base as well. In some religious traditions, darkness is thought of as what lies under all creation. Everything else is added to darkness. This can be helpful with darkness meditation as you can think of darkness as a base to which you can add reflection and insight.

, You should also prepare on a basic level to meditate. You do not want any unnecessary distractions during a meditation session, so make sure you have comfortable clothing. Anything too tight, itchy, or otherwise uncomfortable may distract from the process of clearing your mind. Choose a loose-fitting garment you feel comfortable wearing., You also want to make sure you're comfortable when you're sitting down. If you choose to sit in a chair that isn't comfortable, you'll be distracted. Choose a nice, comfortable place in your home or apartment where you can meditate in peace. You can, for example, you can sit in the middle of your couch with your back straight and your feet firmly on the floor.There is no precise pose or atmosphere required for darkness meditation. Just choose a position and location that feels right for you. The most important thing is that you're comfortable and free from outside distractions.
You do not actually need to be in a dark room to practice darkness meditation. It's important, however, that you find a room where you can concentrate. If it's warm and uncomfortable in your bedroom, this may not be the best place to meditate. If your living room is generally a good temperature and relatively quiet, meditate here.

, Many types of darkness meditation focus on cultivating an internal sense of darkness. You do not necessarily need to be in a pitch dark room to practice the meditation. However, some types of darkness meditation do advocate that you aim for a room that is literally dark. In fact, people do go on darkness retreats with the goal of meditating in darkness for days. If you'd like to incorporate this type of darkness meditation, consider meditating in a dark room. The lack of light will supposedly allow you to focus more on your own thoughts and feelings given the lack of outer stimuli., Darkness meditation requires an intense level of concentration. You may want to warm up before you begin. Try to wind down and clear your mind a bit, especially if you're under a lot of stress. Do something relaxing like reading a book or doing a jigsaw puzzle before attempting to meditate., To start, you will close your eyes. You'll then want to try to clear your mind. During darkness meditation, you want to focus solely on the darkness.Many people allow their thoughts to wander when they close their eyes. You may begin thinking of other things, such as what you have to do later today. Try to ignore these thoughts. When you begin experiencing them, return your thoughts to the darkness.
You want to focus overcoming your fear of darkness, and everything that's represented in that fear. For example, darkness can represent the unknown and also death. Try to gain an acute sense of darkness. You'll want to focus on the darkness. What does the darkness look like? What does it feel like?

, When your eyes are closed, it's common to see images emerge on the screen of your mind. You may see colors, shapes, and may even feel like you're beginning to dream. Try to push such images away and remember to focus on the darkness only. You only want to be looking at darkness.Keep your eyes closed tight if other images creep into your mind's eye. If this is your first time doing darkness meditation, it's very likely you'll see some images. It takes awhile to really be able to commit to seeing darkness.
Consider the darkness you're seeing. If you begin to feel fearful, remember the positive associations with darkness. Think about being inside the womb and then emerging. Think about darkness as a blank slate. You are returning to a blank slate of non-being on which you can build yourself and your thoughts.

, You should keep your eyes closed for about 20 minutes. Set a timer if necessary. During this time, you should deeply consider the darkness. Try to hyper-focus on how the darkness feels, what it means, and any insight you're gaining.Your mind may go to scary places during the duration of this meditation. That's okay. Darkness can bring about a lot of fear. Hyper focusing on darkness for a set period of time can help alleviate some of that fear.
Try to keep focusing on the darkness and how you feel about it. Examine any preconceived notions you have about darkness. Let bad associations give way to more positive ones. Again, think of darkness as a blank slate or in terms of your time in the womb.

, After 20 minutes have passed, open your eyes. Try to bring the sense of darkness into the room with you. Think about what you saw, thought, and experienced in the darkness. Try to imagine the room has that same feeling of darkness. Try to linger for about 5 minutes as you come out of your dream., You should not feel discouraged if your first attempt at darkness meditation does not meet your expectations. It takes a tremendous amount of practice to clear your mind and avoid going into dream mode when closing your eyes. Give it time. It may take months before you master the art of darkness meditation.Practice darkness meditation as often as you feel comfortable. If you have a bad reaction to darkness meditation, you may want to taper off practicing until you feel more calm.

, If you have an intense phobia of the dark, you may want to reconsider darkness meditation. While darkness meditation can help lessen fears or apprehensions regarding darkness, a phobia is a far more intense fear. Phobias should be addressed with a mental health professional and it may be dangerous to try to tackle a phobia on your own.

, Meditation can help with a variety of mental health problems, but it is not therapy in and of itself. If you are experiencing an issue like depression and anxiety, do not attempt to treat it yourself with therapy. Seek out the assistance of a counselor or therapist.You can your regular doctor for a referral to a therapist. You can also call your insurance company and ask for a list of therapists in your network.
If you're a student, you may be entitled to free counseling through your university.

, It's important to come back to the real world after meditating. Meditation can provide a break from troublesome thoughts and allow you to take your mind off certain issues. However, you do not want to remain in a unattached state long term, as this can interfere with your ability to interact with others. Always try to return to the present moment after meditating."

Understand the relationship between color and the chakras.,
Meditate on a specific color to address any emotional or physical dilemma you are facing.,
Try an overall color meditation.",How to Practice Color Meditation," Chakra is the Sanskrit word for wheel.

,


Sit or lie down in a comfortable position in a quiet room.
Take a few deep cleansing breaths.
Start breathing slowly and evenly.
Visualize a golden light over your head and draw the light down through your body, all the way to your toes.
Allow the light to illuminate every aspect of your being.
When you feel completely relaxed, begin meditating on each chakra and its color. Start at your root chakra, which is red, and focus on the aspects of that chakra while you visualize the color red. Continue focusing on each color and chakra until you reach the crown chakra.
Finish your meditation by taking a few more deep cleansing breaths.
Once again, visualize your being with golden light before you come out of your meditative state.

The inner hub represents the 'knowing,' or space of awareness in which any experience happens.
The spokes represent the 'attention' through which we become aware of anything in the outer rim.
The outer rim represents anything we can be aware of. This rim can be divided into 4 segments:

The first segment (top right) represents sense perceptions, including taste, touch, smell, hearing and sight. It's about how we perceive the world through sense perceptions.
The second segment (top left) represents sensations from the inner body. It is also called as sixth sense in science.
The third segment represents our thoughts, images, memories, sounds and how they arrive and leave from our space of consciousness or hub.
The fourth segment represents sense of connection with other people outside of our bodily self.

;
, Before you start, maintain a good posture. Keep a straight back and relax your shoulders, face muscles etc. If its hard for you, then lie down. Alternatively, choose your own comfortable position., The next sections combined as a whole practice take about 20-30 minutes. Practice each step for a few seconds or minutes or however it feels natural.,

Look to the middle of the room. Now to the wall. And again focus your attention to the middle of the room.
Now let the attention come to about a book reading distance from you, as if you are reading a book.
Can you notice that you have the ability to focus your attention at different distances?

, Focus your attention on the breath and feel the sensation of the air as it comes in and out.

Let the sensation from rising and falling of the chest, as you breathe, fill awareness.
Let the sensation from the belly, as it expands and contracts, fill awareness.
Now feel the sensation from the breathe wherever it feels most natural to you. Like sensation from nostrils, sound of breath, chest, belly etc. Ride the wave of the breath in and out.
Let the thoughts come and go. Now take a deep breath and let this breath practice go for now.
Imagine the wheel of awareness as you ride the breath wave and imagine being in the hub of the wheel of knowing. You don't have to visualize it, if it's difficult. Just focus on the sensations.

, Let sounds from the environment fill awareness., Let the light fill awareness. Like light from closed eyelids or the environment, if your eyes are open., Let smell fill awareness., Move the spoke to sense of taste and let it fill awareness., Like the place you are sitting, where hands are touching etc.

Now take a deeper breath.

, Start with muscles and bones and let it fill your awareness., Focus your attention on the forehead and scalp then back of the head and ears. Then to throat, neck and shoulders., Stream attention to both arms to the ends of the fingers. Move to the muscles and bones of upper chest, lower back, abdomen and hip region., Then to pelvic and then opening awareness to genitals., Follow the gut sensation, from the esophagus to all the way to the interior of the throat. Now to the interior of the mouth., Sinuses followed to the back of the nose, from the trachea to the interior of the chest. Open the sensation of the lungs.,, Open the signals of the body and realize them as the source of wisdom and truth.

Now take a deeper breath.

, As explained before, segment 3 represents thoughts, emotions, feeling, ideas, beliefs, visuals etc. Let's explore it in two aspects:

From the hub of knowing, simply invite anything to come into it. It could be thought, visual, sound, etc. Open your mind to whatever comes or doesn't come.
In the second aspect, notice the thoughts and space between the thoughts. Notice how a thought presents itself and how it stays and leaves awareness.
Notice how the next thoughts comes and how the gaps between thoughts feel like.
Now take a deep breath.

, This step is a little advanced so if it feels too subtle then just focus attention on breath.

For those who want to try it out, here it goes: From the hub of knowing bend the spoke of attention back to 'hub of knowing'. Imagine a spoke of attention being pulled back to its source. Be aware of it for a few minutes or as much as it feels natural.
Now ride the wave of the breath, in and out.

,

Open that awareness to all the people around you.

, Open the sense of connection to your friends and family. Now to people with whom you work, and then the people in your neighborhood, Focus on the people in your city, then the people in the state/province, and then all living beings on earth., When repeated to yourself, the following phrases may help improve health and happiness. Silently say them to yourself:

Say to yourself, ""May all living beings be happy and live with a playful joyful heart. May all living beings be healthy. May all living beings be safe and protected from all sorts of harm. May all living beings flourish, thrive and live with the ease of well being.""
Now take a deeper breath.
Say to yourself, ""May I be happy and live with a playful, joyful and grateful heart. May I be healthy and have a body that gives me energy, flexibility, strength and stability. May I be safe and be protected from all sorts of inner and outer harm. May I flourish and thrive and live with the ease of well being.""
Send another wish and taking into account that 'me and 'we' are equally important.
Say to yourself, ""May 'mwe' be happy and have a playful, grateful and joyful heart. May mwe be healthy in a body that gives flexibility, strength and stability. May mwe be safe and be protected from all sorts of inner and outer harm. May mwe flourish and thrive and live with the ease of well being.""

, Whenever you are ready, open your eyes."

If we are listening to music that we naturally like, it is much easier for the binaural beats to do their job in reducing brainwave activity and we can achieve much more concentrated and relaxing meditative states.

Obtain a pen and paper.You should write down the results of your meditation experience.,
Choose your meditation method.,
Choose when you want to meditate.When you incorporate mediation into your daily schedule, you should try to keep it around the same time each day.,
Create an appropriate meditation environment.Your meditation environment can be a bedroom, living room, public park, or other space.,
State your intention.Before meditating, you must get into the right frame of mind.,
Repeat the statement of intention for several minutes.Unless you’re performing a moving or walking mediation, close your eyes.,

Use your recorded meditation experiences to track your progress over time.;
, Meditation is simply the process of reflecting on your situation, centering yourself, and becoming more aware of yourself and your surroundings. There are many varieties of meditation. For instance, you might:Try a walking meditation. In this meditation, you walk through a forest or other relaxing natural setting. Move slowly and deliberately through the forest. Pay close attention to each movement of your feet. Make yourself aware of how your foot feels in your shoe, the feeling of your heel rising from the earth, and the feel of your leg swinging forward with each step. This is not only a great meditation, but a relaxing form of exercise.
Try a gratitude mediation. If you’re not interested in walking meditation, you could try a simple gratitude mediation. Simply envision the face of someone for whom you’re thankful, and say “Thank you for…” and then one or several reasons why you’re thankful for that person. You can say this either quietly to yourself or out loud. This is best performed at the end or beginning of each day.
Try a mantra mediation. If neither a walking meditation or a gratitude meditation interest you, a mantra meditation might. As its name suggests, the mantra meditation utilizes a mantra -- either a single word like “Om” or a short, positive phrase like “I will achieve victory” -- to clear the mind and bring a sense of calm. Sit in a comfortable, quiet place. You can adopt a cross-legged position and sit on a mat or thin pillow if you wish. Speak, sing, or whisper the mantra aloud., This will allow your body and mind to get used to the rhythms of meditation, and can help you slip more easily into a meditative state over time. If you have a spirit animal that is nocturnal like the aardvark, owl, or badger, you might find it beneficial to meditate at night.

, State aloud, “I am going to meet my power animal. Together, we will attain peace of mind. Together, we will become one.”

If you wish to devise your own statement of intention, ensure that it is honest, brief, direct, and positive. State simply what you wish to achieve by meditating with the power animal.

, Speak each syllable slowly and deliberately. Relax into yourself. Open your mind by visualizing your power animal. Where are you? What are you and your power animal doing? Take in as many details as possible.


After 5-10 minutes, end the meditation.

, Did your power animal reveal anything to you? Do you have new insight into yourself or the world around you? Be specific.


Read the details you’ve written the next day. Think them over and look for instances where the insights might be useful.
As you continue to meditate with your power animal, consider bringing concerns and problems into the meditation sessions. Use the meditation to relax and leave behind worries.

Does it have any special calls or make a unique sound?

, Our Mind is constantly active. Seeking stillness within the Mind that is in motion is impossible if you do not use the motion itself. The art of meditation is the art of stillness.

, Chose an object of Beauty that is a symbol of Consciousness… Focus your mind on light (candle flame or imagined light), on feeling of love, feeling of peace, or pure consciousness, allowing the mind to keep ‘busy’ while we connect with the source of power, love, peace and knowledge using the powerful imagery of light, love, peace.

, Allow your body to disappear, your mind to dissolve, open, expand and become one with the Divine Consciousness. All is One. You are One. All is Love. You are Love.

Entering cosmic consciousness we realize that we are not the mind nor the body and that we can transcend space and time. Entering divine consciousness brings to us the sense of One in All and All in One, the sense of expansion, the presence of Divinity in our hearts.

Find a quiet, featureless space.,
Find a soft surface.,
Remove distractions.,
Sit in a comfortable position.",How to Meditate on Breath1," Find a space without loud noises or noticeable odors that might distract you. You should also avoid spaces with excessive decoration or colors that might draw your attention.Indoor spaces are less likely to have distracting sounds but you can meditate outside if you prefer the fresh air and you have some distance from cars or other people.;
, Most people sit down when they meditate so find a spot where you can sit comfortably for more than 10 minutes. Plush carpeting or soft grass are ideal. You could also lay down a yoga mat or even just a towel.

, Turn off or silence your phone and anything else that might make a noise. If there are other people around, tell them you plan to meditate and ask to be left alone for the next few minutes.

Remember that occasional bad thoughts are normal.,
Think about what makes the thought “bad.” Why are you upset about this thought?,
Slow down your thoughts with a few deep breaths.,
Ask yourself why you’re having negative or bad thoughts.,
Remain in the moment.,
Put your thoughts in perspective.,
Distract yourself with something specific that you know gives you comfort.,
Don’t try and run away from your thoughts or “push” them out.,
Work on “letting go” of problems.,
Literally “throw your problem away.” This may sound odd, but an Ohio State study found that people who write down their bad thoughts and then throw the paper away had a better self-image than people who kept the paper.,
Talk through your bad thoughts with someone you trust.",How to Get Rid of Bad Thoughts1," This is possibly the single easiest way to start addressing your problems. Too often you believe that you are the only one with problems, or that no one understands what you are going through, but bad thoughts are a part of life and, most importantly, they will go away. Don’t beat yourself up for having bad thoughts, because they aren’t your fault.Avoid language like ‘this is my fault,” “I shouldn’t be thinking this,” or “I hate this thought.”
You’ve had bad thoughts before, and you’ll have them again. But you are still here, alive, and healthy. Your bad thoughts won’t kill you if you don’t turn them into monsters.;
, What is making it stick in your head? Oftentimes bad thoughts persist because you feel guilty, angry, or unsure about the future, so thinking about why you are caught on the same thought can help give it shape and find ways to address the problem. Common reasons for tough thoughts include:


Guilt
Anxiety
Jealousy
Temptation
Failure or Fear of Failure., It is natural to feel anxious or nervous when a bad thought suddenly crops up in your brain, but resist the urge to get upset. Take 30 seconds to stop what you are doing and take five deep, long breaths. Give yourself a moment to address the thought instead of jumping right to irrational or extreme conclusions.


Try counting to 15 if you still feel nervous.
Head outside, remove yourself from the room, or take a short walk to clear your head., Once you’ve slowed down and thought about the reason you are upset, it’s time to question why the thought is so negative. Some good questions to ask include:


What hard evidence do I have for my anxiety or fears?
What are the positives of the situation I am forgetting?
Is there another way to look at this situation? How would someone else see me?
Will this matter in 5 years?, You cannot control the future and you cannot control the past. What you can do is deal with the present. Many bad thoughts stem from forgetting this fact and making projections or guesses about what is to come. For example, you may tell yourself that your test tomorrow is going to be super hard, and you will definitely fail, but your bad thought has no basis in reality. When the test does arrive on your desk you’ve already told yourself it will be terrible instead of finding ways to make it easier the night before. Don’t let your guesses about the future ruin the present., Your initial reaction to a bad thought will be to blow it out of proportion: “I was tempted by another woman, I must not love my wife,” “My boss didn’t like the presentation, I’m going to be fired,” “Everyone else has a nice car, I must be a failure.” These thoughts are not only simplistic, they are often flat-out wrong. Remember that you are not the center of the universe and that most problems in your life will not ultimately mean much to your happiness.


Remember problems from years past, like getting grounded or dumped – while they might have felt like horrible thoughts at the time, chances are good you have long since moved on without any real damage., Return to something that you know and love to help take your mind off your problems. Experiencing something tied to good memories can put the bad thought in perspective – things haven’t always been bad, and they won’t always be bad in the future.Re-read your favorite book.

, Telling yourself not to think about something is as good as thinking about it. You spend all of your time saying “stop thinking about my breakup” that you don’t realize you are still talking about your breakup! You need to either move your thoughts in another direction or try and tackle the bad thought head on. Trying to consciously push the thought out, however, will only prolong your problems.

, Instead of fighting bad thoughts, take a deep breath, acknowledge them, and move on. This is difficult to learn, but mastering this skill is the best way to fight negative thoughts for the rest of your life.For example, you may be worried that your spouse was fired. When the worries about money hit you, don’t race to find ways to blame someone or think things you could have done to avoid the issue. Note the issue and then forget about it. It will come back, but you can always use the same strategy when it does.


Think things like, “I cannot control everything in the world,” “I can’t change the past,” and “it is time to move forward.”

, Writing is a way of expressing your problems, and physically getting rid of them tells your body that it is time to move on.The same study found that even dragging a file to your computer’s Trash Bin has the same positive effects.

, Getting your bad thoughts off your chest and into the open is a great way to work through what makes a thought so bad. It also, more often than not, helps you realize that the thought is not as bad as it seemed. Once you’ve put words to your anxiety, you can get valuable advice and perspective from someone who has likely had similar anxieties. Many psychiatrists have found that simply telling your thoughts in a comfortable setting may be enough to eliminate them.


Bad thoughts are basically talking to yourself, and everything you say sounds true. Having another perspective can help you find the flaws in your logic and end the thought."

Time your breaths.,
Hold your breath in for 2 seconds.,
Focus on your muscle reaction.,
Redirect your wandering mind.",How to Meditate on Breath2," The purpose of any meditative technique is to take your mind off potentially distracting thoughts that may pop up as you attempt to center yourself. Exhale and then slowly inhale until your lungs feel full. Count the seconds and then try to take the same amount of time to exhale. The length of time will depend on your lung capacity but you should generally try to breathe slowly. Continue breathing on this number of seconds to prevent other thoughts from entering your mind.Try breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth.For a slower, more relaxing meditation, try the 4-7-8 exercise. Exhale, then close your mouth and inhale for four seconds, hold your breath for 7 seven seconds, and exhale over the course of 8 seconds., Focus on the curve of your breath. The curve is part where you change from inhaling to exhaling and vice versa. Try not to curve your breath too quickly.It may help to add a 2 second waiting period between when your lungs are full and when they are empty to slow down your curve.

, Focus your mind on how parts of your body react to your breathing. Feel your diaphragm, throat muscles, and shoulders shift as you inhale and exhale to occupy your mind. This should not be a painful strain but you should feel your muscles stretching in these areas. If may help to place your hand on your diaphragm so you can feel the muscle reaction.You can also focus on the relaxed parts of your body. Leave your hands and arms in a comfortable pose that doesn’t require you work any of their muscles and keep your mind focused there.

, Think of a word or phrase like “breathe” to repeat to yourself when you catch your mind wandering. Accept that this is natural and don’t give up if you’re struggling to stay focused. Remember that you should be concentrating on your breathing pattern."

Recognize people that trigger bad thoughts.,
Be proactive about solving bad thoughts.,
Find a creative outlet for your negativity.,
Remember to smile.,
See a professional if you cannot shake your thoughts.",How to Get Rid of Bad Thoughts2," Positive affirmation is taking the time to recognize that you are happy, healthy, and have a sense of self-worth. Negative thoughts (self-deprecating, unworthiness, etc) can be helped with positive affirmations. Practice saying “I am...” and following it with something you love about yourself, such as “I am smart,” “I am good at my job,” or “I am a loving part of my family.”Make a list of your positive attributes and put it somewhere you can see it daily, like on your desk or bathroom mirror.
Fight bad thoughts head on: If you keep saying “I am too dumb,” recognize the many things you do know with positive affirmations like “I know how to fix cars,” “I can cook,” or “I am intelligent.”

, Most bad thoughts come during periods of free time when you brain is allowed to wander without distraction. Find things to do that will eliminate too much time alone, like starting an exercise routine, beginning a writing or art project, or community service.


Being alone is not bad, but being alone with no idea what to do can create anxiety and apprehension.

, Relationships are some of the most fraught, psychologically difficult landscapes to navigate. You may find yourself trying in vain to figure out what the other person is thinking, if your friend meant to insult you, or if someone is talking behind your back. If you have a friend or significant other who constantly triggers bad thoughts, however, this is not your fault. For whatever reason, this relationship may not be healthy.Give yourself some space from negative people – do the bad thoughts disappear when you haven’t seen them for a while?
Avoid friends who constantly insult your or make jokes at your expense, skip meetings with you, or don’t respect your time or hobbies.

, Make a list of all the things you could do to address your bad thought. For example, if you are worrying incessantly about your relationship, ask yourself what you can do to make things more comfortable. Plan a date, purchase some flowers for your significant other, talk to your partner, and go out with some of your friends to have fun on your own.


You might not be able to accomplish everything on your list, but having a group of actions you could take helps you regain control of your thoughts.

, Writing things down, losing yourself in an instrument, or painting out your feelings are all valuable ways to explore your negative thoughts and begin dealing with them. Remember to refrain from judgement—the point of art is to express your thoughts, not criticize them. Even if you never show your project to anyone, simply making it can be a great way to direct your bad thoughts through another outlet., Smiling has been proven to release chemicals inside your body that makes you happier. So show off your pearly whites and let the world know you are happy, and you’ll be surprised to see people smiling back. Between the social and chemical reinforcement, this can actually make the difference between a sunny, happy outlook and being trapped by bad thoughts.The inverse is also true, so making frowny or sad faces can lead to more negative thoughts as well.

, If you are depressed, suicidal, or chronically hurting, you should call a mental health professional immediately. They are trained to help you on the road to recovering your positive thoughts, and will be there to support you as you learn.

Take care of your body.,
Begin a meditation practice.,
Work towards long-term goals.,
Have a sense of humor when faced with hardship.,
Find a friend or family member that you can be honest with.",How to Get Rid of Bad Thoughts3," There is a direct correlation between mental and physical health, and one will suffer if you neglect the other. Make sure you prioritize your body so that your brain is well equipped to handle stress and difficult or bad thoughts. Exercise 3-5 times a day for at least 30 minutes.
Eat a balanced diet and avoid junk foods.
Hydrate with 6-8 full glasses of water each day.
Get 6-8 hours of regular sleep each night.

, Shown time and time again to promote positive thinking and mental health, meditation is the process of clearing your mind and coming to peace with your thoughts. Find 10-15 minutes a day to sit quietly with your thoughts. Focus on your breathing and let your thoughts drift freely. As you progress you’ll find yourself taking more and more time to meditate, and your bad thoughts will start to slowly fade into the background., Most people feel bad thoughts creeping in when they imagine their future, creating stress and insecurity. Write down your goals, then break them up into small, manageable tasks you can tackle easily. Celebrate when you hit milestones, and always you’re your end goal in sight when things get tough.


For example, you might be worried about thoughts that you will never finish the novel you dream of writing. Instead of worrying, set aside 30 minutes a day to write. As you get more comfortable, make it 1 hours, then 2 hours until you have a few chapters to start editing.

, Laughing away accidents and misfortune is one of the best ways to stay sharp and sane. Humor will “re-set” negative events in a positive manner, ending the stress and worry. Laughter will give you much needed perspective on your thoughts and make it easier to keep bad thoughts at bay.Laugh at yourself too – you shouldn't take your life so seriously that you forget to enjoy it.
Laughter is contagious, so join people who laugh a lot or tell jokes. If you gravitate towards people who like to laugh, you’ll find yourself laughing more as well.

, Just knowing that there is someone who you can be open and honest with can make bad thoughts seem much less daunting. Building trust with someone takes time, and you’ll need to be a little vulnerable sharing your concerns with another person, but having this bond will ultimately help you realize that you are not alone. You can deal with your bad thoughts when they appear, and there will be someone to help you.


If you feel like you can’t share your thoughts with someone for whatever reason, consider making an appointment with a professional therapist. They are trained to listen well and help you work through your problems.

Know your motivation and keep it top of mind.,
Schedule a time for your meditation.,
Set a timer.,
Use Guided Instruction.If you are just beginning a meditation practice, it is strongly recommend that you listen to guided instruction for the first several weeks or months of practice.,
Community.",How to Keep Up a Daily Meditation Practice," In order to stick with daily meditation you need to know why you are meditating. Otherwise, there will always be something that will feel more important and productive than sitting and following your breath for 30 minutes. Some of the most common reasons people meditate include: to manage stress, to feel happier, to improve concentration and focus, to feel more relaxed, to deal with pain, to decrease depression and to sleep better. There is scientific research evidence that daily meditation helps with all of these things. If you meditate for a period of time and notice some positive effects, write those down and read them when you’re feeling unmotivated.;
, Research has shown that people who schedule a specific time to do something are 8 times as likely to follow through compared to those who don’t set a time. By scheduling a time to do something, you won’t spend the day thinking, when am I going to do it? If you can’t do the same time every day, that’s okay. You may want to sit down and plan what time you can meditate each day of the week and for how long. Write it in a calendar. Set a reminder in your phone.

, When you sit for meditation set a timer for the length of practice you want to do. Commit to yourself that you will not get up until the timer goes off. You will probably want to stop at some point during a sitting period. But let the timer tell you when to stop. This gives you the opportunity to sit through the urge to stop and to observe the sensations, thoughts and feelings that may have been causing you to want to stop.

, Gradually you will internalize the instruction, but to start you will benefit from good guidance from a trained instructor. Over time you can alternate days with guidance and days without. There are many good CDs and MP3s out there with meditation instructions. Here are some recommended teachers who have meditation CDs and MP3s: Jon Kabat Zinn, Jack cornfield, Sharon Salsberg, Joseph Goldstein or Stephen Levine.

, Community is probably the most essential aspect of keeping up a meditation practice. Connecting with a group of people who meditate together (a sangha) and a teacher to guide you will help motivate you and will ensure you continue to grow in your practice. Through a sangha you will continue to learn from a teacher and fellow meditators, and get support if you are facing barriers or obstacles. Meditation sitting groups are pretty common in big cities, where you can drop in and pay by donation. For a list of sitting groups in your city, do an online search for ""meditation sitting group"" or ""sangha"" in your area.

Choose a time when you can meditate every day.,
Find a place where you can meditate without interruption.,
Decide how long you will meditate.",How to Meditate and Have a Calm Mind1," Think about your daily routine and find a time of day that’s usually free. Morning is usually best because your mind is calmer before you dive into your day. It doesn’t have to be a long period of time—even five minutes of meditation can be beneficial, and you can meditate more than once a day if that works better for your schedule. The important thing is that you make meditation part of your daily routine., Ideally, you’ll be able to find a place you can leave set up for your meditation. The main thing to look for is a place that is quiet and relatively free of distractions.You’ll need a place where you can fit a cushion or chair to meditate on, and where you can sit comfortably.
You may want to set up your meditation space with incense, candles, or soothing images, but this is not required. Set your meditation space to be whatever makes you most comfortable.

, The general guideline is that you should meditate for however long you are comfortable, plus five minutes. It may take a few tries to figure out how long is best for you. Your meditation period will seem like forever in the beginning, but you’ll get used to it as you practice. Then you’ll be able to sit for longer, if you have the time.You can use a timer or phone alarm if you want to, but make sure that it has a soothing alarm. You don’t want to be startled out of your meditation. Make sure that you keep the device far enough away that you don’t feel compelled to check it while you’re meditating.

Dress comfortably.,
Stretch.,
Settle into a straight posture.,
Relax your muscles.,
Focus on your breathing.,
Try using a mantra.,
Ease out of your meditation.",How to Meditate and Have a Calm Mind2," Wear something that you can sit in comfortably without adjusting. This could be pajamas or workout clothes, or just a comfy T-shirt and jeans—whatever works for you. Many people take off their shoes when they meditate, but don’t feel like you have to if you don’t want to.

, A few gentle stretches will loosen your body up and get it ready for meditation. Do some neck and back rolls, stretch your arms up above your head, touch your toes (or get as close as you can).

, Sit or kneel comfortably on a chair or cushion. Your arms should hang at your sides and your hands should be loose or in your lap. The most important thing is to keep your spine tall and straight and to face forward with your chin tucked in slightly.You may find it helpful at first to meditate with your back against a wall or a straight-backed chair until you feel comfortable sitting up straight on your own.

, Once you’ve set your posture, take some time to relax all of your other muscles. Your shoulders, arms, legs, and belly should all be soft and hang loose. Breathe in through your nose and as you breathe out through your mouth, relax any muscles that are still tense. You may need to do this a few times before you feel fully relaxed.It’s also a good idea to close or unfocus your eyes. Visual stimulation will distract you and make it harder to relax., Pay attention to the way your breath moves in and out of your body. Don’t worry about altering your breathing, just be mindful of how it’s happening. After a few breaths, start counting your breaths, starting with one on your first inhalation, two on your first exhalation, three on the next inhalation, and so on until you reach ten. Then start again with one on the inhale.


If your mind starts to wander as you do this, don’t panic. Just bring your attention back to your breathing and continue counting where you left off. If you can’t remember where you left off, start back at one., If you want to, after 30 seconds of focusing on your breathing, you can add in a mantra. A mantra is a word that makes you feel relaxed and calm, which you repeat silently to yourself while meditating.


The word can be anything you want, as long as you can remember it and as long as it brings out your inner calm. Don’t pick a word that will make you angry or make you want to laugh.
Silently repeat the mantra to yourself.
If you find your mind wandering, don’t feel bad. Just gently bring your focus back to your mantra and your breathing.
Continue repeating your mantra until your time is over., Don’t just get up when your timer sounds. This will shake your mind out of its calmness and diminish the effects of your meditation. Instead, take it slow.


Take note of your body and its physical surroundings. Feel the cushion or chair beneath you and the position of your body.
Take in any smells, tastes, or physical sensations you feel.
Open your eyes only when you feel ready, part of the physical world once again."
"
While sitting or standing with the spine straight take a few breaths to relax and settle into your position.,
Now, place the palm of one hand on your lower abdomen and the other on the small of your back.,
Now, begin to stretch the breath and release all of those habits of tension.,
As this becomes comfortable lengthen the count to six, then eight, twelve, etc.",How to Improve Breathing Habits,";
, As you inhale, feel your core pressing out on each palm and relax the perineum (the pelvic floor). Don’t tense any muscles to do so, just let the air push the diaphragm down and expand the lower torso. As you exhale, don’t push the air out. Gradually relax and let the air flow out, drawing the walls of the lower torso in with it. Once this begins to feel natural you can relax the arms and breathe with the use of the palms.

, Inhale for a slow count of four, exhale for a slow count of four.

, There is no limit to how far you can work the breath as long as you are inhaling and exhaling smoothly without pause. Play this breathing pattern for anywhere from five to thirty minutes.

Prioritize your tasks.,
Focus on doing one thing at a time.,
Exercise regularly.,
Spend some time each day without screens.,
Cut back on the coffee.,
Practice mindfulness.,
Count your blessings.",How to Meditate and Have a Calm Mind3," It’s easy to feel overwhelmed when you’ve got a thousand things to do at once. But looking at your to-do list as a path rather than a mountain can help you to feel less stressed. Ask yourself which tasks are most urgent and which you can save until tomorrow, or even the next day. Acknowledge that you won’t necessarily be able to get everything done today and that stress will only make the work you do feel harder.Where possible, try doing a little bit of work every day on the big tasks you have to accomplish. This slow-and-steady approach will help you to feel calm as deadlines approach and will also allow you to focus the bulk of your attention on more immediate tasks without neglecting bigger, long-term ones.

, If you’re feeling so frazzled by all the things you have to get done that you’re having trouble doing anything, try picking one simple task and focusing on that. Then pick one more task and focus on just doing that. Eventually, you’ll get some momentum going and you won’t feel so overwhelmed. You’ll just move on to the next thing.


Avoid multitasking. Trying to do three, or six, or ten things at once isn’t efficient. You can’t do any of the tasks as well when you’re doing all of them at once, and you’ll end up making mistakes that will require you to do more work than you otherwise would have. Instead, focus on one thing at a time and do it as well as you can. When you feel comfortable with your work, move on to the next thing., Exercise is a great stress reliever. It gives you a chance to exorcise your anxiety and also releases endorphins, which are hormones that make you feel happy.Regular exercise is best, but even a short walk or an office “dance break” when you’re feeling overwhelmed can beat your anxiety into submission., Studies show that constant access to email and social media may contribute to higher stress levels and loss of focus. If you want to calm your mind, try taking a break from your computer and your smart phone for an hour a day. Worst case scenario, you get to focus on something else for a while., Coffee is a stimulant, so it can raise your blood pressure and make your brain activity more frenetic. If you drink a lot of coffee, it may be contributing to your stress. If you want to have a calm mind, try drinking water or tea after your first cup or two of coffee.

, Mindfulness is the practice of focusing on your body and your senses for a period of time. When you have a quiet moment, spend some time focusing on whatever you are doing in the present time. Ask yourself, “What am I doing right now?” Pay close attention to your body—your posture, your senses, your physical movements.Don’t analyze or critique what you’re doing. Just notice it as if you are a casual observer.
If you feel your mind wandering focus on your breathing for a moment, like you would during meditation.
Notice all five of your senses. Pay attention not just to physical sensations or sights, but also smells, sounds and tastes.
If you find yourself having thoughts that won’t go away, take some time out of your mindfulness to write the thoughts down. Then you can go back to being mindful, knowing that you’ll get back to those thoughts when you’re finished., Set aside some time in each day to remind yourself of the good things in your life. They can be different things every day or the same things, and there can be as many as you want. Your blessings can be as simple as a delicious meal you ate that day or as major as the love of your family—whatever makes you feel grateful."

Practice deep breathing when you get stressed out.,
Give yourself a mini-massage.,
Go outside.,
Spend some time with your (or a friend’s) pet.,
Listen to some relaxing music.",How to Meditate and Have a Calm Mind4," We breathe differently when we are calm than we do when we are anxious, and deep breathing sends a signal to the body that it’s time to relax. Close your eyes and feel your body settle into the ground. Take in a deep breath through your nose, then breath out slowly through your mouth. Imagine your stress escaping your body as you exhale., Make yourself comfortable and rub your hands over your neck and shoulders or calves and feet. You can also roll a tennis ball over your muscles with the palm of your hand.You can also apply pressure to pressure points like the skin between your thumb and forefinger. This one is especially handy if you get stressed out in a meeting or other place where you can’t give yourself a full-on massage., Another great way to beat feelings of stress is to change your environment for a few minutes. Five minutes outside in the sunshine can do wonders for your mood. If you can’t go outside, even just getting away from your current setting can break those anxious feelings. Grab a cup of tea or chat with a friend—anything to give your mind a mini-vacation from whatever is stressing you out., Studies suggest that spending time with an animal you’ve bonded with can relieve stress. Even something as simple as petting a cat or dog can calm your nerves and make you feel happier. Your pet will never judge you—they’re just happy to get some of your attention. If you don’t have a pet of your own, borrow a friend’s., Music is another mood-booster. Turning on some slow-rhythmed, up-beat tunes can make you feel happier, steady your heart rate, and release endorphins.Try making a playlist of songs that make you feel happy when you hear them. That way when you’re stressed, you can just start listening.

Ask yourself for solutions.",How to Meditate for Health," Generally speaking, meditation can replace medical treatment only in very advanced practitioners, so it is necessary to consult your physician prior to starting to see how it can best suit your needs. Because meditation and mindfulness practices are increasingly known in the medical sphere many physicians can recommend local community services that offer meditation classes.;
, It may be simple stress management, injury healing or helping the body recover from an illness. Generally, the biggest obstacles to healing or health improvement is either fighting or rejecting the condition you suffer, or trying directly to improve your condition - which is essentially the same as rejecting it, just in another style. These are both very effective obstacles both to meditation and improving your health.


In nearly all meditation traditions, the most important states to develop for good health or health improvement are those of kindness, acceptance and a letting be. These are always the most important as meditation is simply a dual process of letting go, or more properly, getting out of the way of the body's natural health and immune systems so they can work more effectively, as well as encouraging and developing conditions for them to act at peak levels.

, The best forms of meditation for health are sometimes not the simple styles of sitting on a cushion. Moving forms such as Qi Gong, Tai Chi and very gentle forms of stretching like yoga, can be more effective.


For viruses such as colds and flus, excessive sitting can reduce your circulation and therefore make your immune system less effective when it is already working on an illness.

While the rest and relaxation that can be gained through sitting meditation is certainly important, it is wise to balance your practice or incorporate moving forms to boost your immune health. For pain management, lying down to meditate can be the most effective, for stress or mental health, most postures are fine. For physical health, moving forms such as Qi Gong and Tai Chi are about the best forms available as they have been developed over thousands of years in some cases, and are excellent for health in age related contexts.



, The problem that prevents most health improvement or injury healing meditations doing their work, is that people can often treat illness or pain as the enemy, or the body as a traitor for getting ill. There are plenty of other patterns this may occur in, but ultimately, for these processes to work, you have to allow things to be in order for your health to improve naturally.


Your immune system is also boosted by these practices of kindness and generosity, so it is ideal to reflect on your good qualities to give yourself inspiration.

, Once you have meditated for some time and the mind becomes peaceful, you may ask yourself for advice - this is a same function in a way as dreaming, where the mind sometimes sends you a ""wake up call"" about your lifestyle to act on in your dreams. Meditation is a more inviting method where you can ask yourself how you can improve your health. Sometimes it may point to aspects of your environment that can cause a sense of depression or illness, and sometimes it can present itself as a feeling, such as being tired and overworked. Sometimes the mind itself tells you something directly - such as to stop eating certain foods that it can no longer digest well, or that it is becoming allergic to.


However, it is always wise to get a second opinion from your physician on any advice your mind offers. Sometimes people are convinced they know what the answer is and so tell themselves what they really want to hear, which isn't necessarily what they really need.

, For general health, sitting posture is ideal, for recovering from illness, moving meditations such as Qi Gong or Tai Chi are particularly beneficial.

, Take a good few minutes scanning your body starting wherever feels comfortable for you. You may move head to toes or toes up to the head, or in a circular movement clockwise or anticlockwise. Use these moment to become aware of and relax any tension you can find.

, Locate and imagine all illnesses as blockages in your body, like a traffic jam on the freeway or a dam in a mountain stream. Choose any symbolism that seems apt to you. Often it will take on its own form of representation which gives you clues how you can act. In can also appear as a more clear and distinct physical sensation or tension for those who are more sensation strong in their awareness.

, You might imagine the rocks of the dam starting to roll away as the water starts to flow through them, or the tension turning into vapor.

, This should be done very gently - sometimes it will happen all on its own if the illness is caused by stress or lifestyle problems. Sometimes however, it needs a little imagination and improvisation, such as imagining it flowing into a box which you mentally post to outer space, or transforming it into something else like a beautiful flower which you plant in the garden, or into little birds which fly away.


Another common practice that is quite effective is you can also imagine it flowing out as you breathe out.

, Sometimes, you may feel like five minutes is sufficient and doing this everyday for your health can make a remarkable improvement to your immune health. Sometimes, the body may simply want to take a lot longer, and that is fine too.

, For pain management, choose the most comfortable posture for you. Part of the skill of pain management is setting the foundation first as it makes far less work.

, At this stage, don't focus too much on the direct area of the pain. This allows the mind to expand slightly more than just focussing solely on the aches and pain - in many cases this reduces the pain to quite a moderate extent allowing it to be more manageable.

, This is very difficult for beginners and takes a lot of practice, but for chronic long term sufferers this is a skill which becomes more and more important and effective for pain management.


You may use words or just develop the feeling by thinking about something that inspires kindness and compassion in you, then when it is strong enough, gradually transfer that feeling to the pain. It is very important to come to the stage where you understand that the chronic pain, or your body, is not the enemy.

, It can appear in any form that is apt to you, such as a warm massage like feeling; a cooling, soothing feeling; a warm glow in a beautiful colour or anything that you feel is appropriate.

, You may continue to do this for as long as you like, but even a few seconds can make a big difference to healing and pain management.

, Often people mentally encapsulate the injury or feeling with tension - something they are not always aware of, but stems from rejecting or trying to fight or get away from the injury. The problem is this makes the injury heal much slower and makes the pain, far worse. Continue to relax any tension as it becomes evident, this may involve giving it a gentle massage with your hands if necessary.

, This completes the session. This type of meditation can be practiced as often as you wish. It is very difficult to practice because it requires the practitioner to develop kindness towards something people inherently want to get away from.

, It is recommended to become quite aware of the feelings in your body as often physical tension creates mental stress, and mental tension can create physical tension. It is important to balance the two.

, Often people who suffer extreme anxiety, work related stress and panic attacks frequently find tension in the chest, shoulders and arms. By relaxing these parts of the body, it typically removes a great deal of the stress that causes panic attacks.


Long standing practitioners of this form of meditation often find that is resolves their stress, anxiety and panic attacks because it gives them not only a direct skill to handle it, but also the knowledge and understanding of experience that these stressful events can be gently reduced and prevented from spiralling out of control. It essentially gives them the power to direct their attention more beneficially.

, This is often just wishing yourself well because when you no longer are fighting yourself, you find the mind is vastly more motivated and cooperative in working with you to put an end to stress and tension.

, A very good one is to imagine the past and future being put away for the time being, so that for the time you meditate, you don't have to be concerned with them. While it may mean after your meditation you have to pick them up again and carry on working, it gives you a rest time that you can use whenever you need it.

, As mentioned above, the mind can often be very creative in giving you solutions to resolves problems in your family, school or workplace.

Consider what your aim is.,
Make full use of free time.,
Form a group.,
Develop kindness in your space.,
Use a variety of styles.,
Develop your awareness.",How to Meditate at Work1," Meditation as part of our everyday lives has a wide range of applications - such as relaxation, creative thinking and inspiration, analytical problem solving etc - and for this reason, each has different requirements or conditions for them to be effective. By understanding what you are looking for, you can far more easily develop the meditation.;
, It is not usually easy to break away for a long period if you are busy, nor should you waste your lunch break by eating to fast to make room for meditation because eating too fast can make you feel uncomfortable in meditation. The best system is to favour quality over quantity in a busy workplace, so this may mean coming in early to the office when it is quiet, or just taking a regular five minute break every hour or so for a quiet few minutes. Even if you don't meditate, those regular short breaks give you more energy generally, so a few quiet minutes can always offer great benefits.


People in small workspaces such as offices or workshops often can't break away and find a quiet room during their work-time, so it is advantageous to make use of external spaces such as behind the buildings, rooftops, the toilet / bathroom, even in your car if it is not possible to come in early when the office is empty and quiet.

, Group sittings can build a great deal of energy and harmony in the workplace, but when you have several people interested in meditating, it can be much easier to ask for a special room or time when you can meditate and therefore your meditation feels more comfortable and stable. You can also seek permission to renovate the workspace to be more bright and friendly to be in.


If you include your team into the equation, stronger and more tolerant network connections can be built in the team dynamic.

, This is an area that is largely anecdotal, but many practitioners feel that by sending kindness to the space in which they work, they feel that space becoming almost like a battery for good energy. Other people who come into that space - even if they don't meditate - often can feel that energy and feel more comfortable to be in that space, which is very useful in an team work environment, or when dealing with customers.


This also can work in a very tense or busy office environment that by sending kindness to it, eventually it feels a less harsh environment to be in.

, You do not need a special place or single type of meditation; you can sit in an office chair, practice standing meditation in a corner or walk up and down in a free corridor. Varying your practice in this way has its advantages when you try and incorporate the relaxation into any posture; therefore you can relax in any situation - especially busy ones.

, Being aware of the subtle things around you - that everyone often forgets about - gives you a new sense of perspective and can sharpen your focus. This skill is very useful in negotiation, in planning and in conflict management.

Tension is a common cause of stress and fatigue, which comes from the tiredness or aches and pains from thinking, working, sitting or standing too long. This tension causes more stress when you start to feel and react to it, so what could be resolved quite easily is often snowballed into a bigger problem.

, This means, when you are sitting, that you put your attention on your feet and wiggle them gently, then you relax them entirely. Then allow this foot movement to include your legs from the knees down and you stretch them, then allowing them to relax completely. Then you change over to gently tensing or wiggling your thighs and backside, then including your spine as part of this movement, and then relax completely.


Eventually you follow this pattern to move from one area of the body to another such as moving your hands and then including your arms and shoulders. This process releases a lot of tension and improves circulation. You may also do any simple stretching methods that you may know as an alternative to this method.

, This allows you to notice any possible things or problems that may need to be changed in your design that may have slipped past unnoticed.


Alternatively, if you are dealing with a problem in the office, you can imagine sitting down and talking to that person and see what feelings come up. This helps you to interact better with them in real life as well as to allow deeper solutions your mind may offer to come to the surface.
This method actually has an enormous scope as it can easily be used for any challenge or new design idea to come forward. It helps build a high degree of confidence in the practitioner because they have more tools in their box when it comes to making new innovations, or solving difficult challenges.

You can also go to a local meditation center. There are both secular and religious centers with a focus on meditation. Many meditation centers will have times when you can drop in and meditate with other people, as well as classes and other events.
If you want to meditate someplace with other people, the Center for Mindfulness has a list of meditation centers: People meditate in airports, parks, hospitals and other places. Once you have learned to meditate, you can meditate in many different places. To start, it is best to find someplace quiet and relaxing.;
, Do a few stretches before you start meditating. You can choose a few simple stretches to perform prior to sitting on your meditation cushion or chair. Try two or three of the following stretches before meditating:


Do a cow pose. Put your knees on the ground and your hands on the ground in front of you. Inhale and drop your spine and belly to the ground. At the same time, lift your chest upwards.Do the cat pose. You can do this stretch after the cow pose. Put your knees on the ground and your hands on the ground in front of you. As you exhale, drop your head to the ground and lift your back up to the ceiling.Stretch your shoulders. Stand up with your arms to the side. Your arms should be at a ninety-degree angle to your torso. As you inhale, roll your arms so that your palms face the ceiling. Then, as you exhale, roll your arms the other way so that they are facing backwards.Shrug your shoulders. As you inhale, lift your shoulders up high as if you were trying to reach the ceiling. Hold for one second. As you exhale, let your shoulders drop down. Repeat three times., Prior to meditating, it is helpful to decide how long you want to practice. There is no rule for how long you need to meditate. Try meditating for five minutes to see how it feels. If you like it and have more time, try meditating for ten or fifteen minutes the next time you practice.Although experienced meditators will meditate for days, weeks and even months at a time, you can get many of the benefits of meditation by practicing for short periods every day.
Try meditating for five minutes every day and then work your way up to longer periods of meditation.

, Set the timer on your watch or the meditation application on your phone.

Alternately, you can choose a traditional meditation posture such as cross legged on a meditation cushion. Regardless of the posture you choose, you should sit with a straight spine, an open chest and a relaxed body. If the posture feels uncomfortable, you might want to shift postures until you find a comfortable way of sitting.


If you are just starting to meditate and have not received instruction, it might be easiest to sit in a chair. Find a chair that is comfortable but not too relaxed. For instance, you might want to sit on a kitchen chair and avoid the La-Z-Boy in the living room. Put both of your feet firmly on the ground in front of you and place your hands palm down on your thighs.
You can sit on a meditation cushion with your feet cross legged. You do not have to assume a lotus pose. Simply sit on the cushion with your feet crossed in front of you. Keep your back straight.

, If you have practiced yoga or martial arts, you may prefer half-lotus, full-lotus or kneeling. These are traditional meditation postures that are used in yoga and other traditions. If you have learned these poses in yoga class or elsewhere, you may wish to meditate in these postures. However, if you have not tried them, you may want to use a chair or simply sit cross legged on a cushion.


Exercise caution if you have never tried the half or full lotus positions. If you have a bad knee or back, you might want to avoid them.
In the full lotus position, you are sitting cross legged with your feet on opposing thighs. Start by sitting on the floor with both of your legs extended in front of you. Start by pulling your right knee into your chest. Then, put your right ankle on top of your left hip. Bend your left knee and hug it into your chest. Then, put your left ankle on top of your right shin. Pull your knees close together. Rest your hands on your knees with your palms facing up.In the half lotus position, you are sitting cross legged with one foot on the opposing thigh.

As the buses come and go, you may feel more aware or mindful of yourself., As the thought buses come and go, keep coming back to the feeling of the breath as it enters and leaves your body. You should focus your attention on the feeling of your breath and let the thought buses come and go.It is good to observe where your mind goes during meditation, but avoid following it.

Reap the benefits of new experiences.",How to Visit a Nudist Resort or Beach," Spend some time familiarizing yourself with different beaches and resorts. While most beaches and resorts are technically ""clothing optional"", there are some places where complete nudity is more enthusiastically encouraged. Some resorts and beaches allow nudity or going topless, but it is not necessarily embraced by everyone. At other sites, full nudity is the norm. Read reviews from previous visitors. If you are looking into a resort, look for reviews on travel sites. You'll be able to get a feel for what type of experience to expect.
Ask around. If you have heard about a particular beach where nudity is an often, ask people from the area if they have ever been. You should also find out whether nudity is merely accepted, or if it is actually legal. Some towns or states have statutes against public nudity, whereas others allow it in certain areas.
Decide whether you want to spend several hours or several days nude. This can help you determine whether you want to just try visiting a beach, or whether you want to book a stay at a resort.
Make sure that the resort is reputable. Some resorts claim to embrace the nudist lifestyle but are actually more like a singles scene. A beach that embraces the nudist philosophy will usually not focus on sexuality, whereas that might be a component at some couples resorts. This is a personal preference, but one you should be aware of when deciding where to go. Read reviews from previous travelers or beach goers to get a good sense of the atmosphere.;
, Your next step is to decide what type of activities you would like to do. If you would like to just kick back on a beach and relax, there are plenty of options out there for you. But you should also know that there are many active nudist vacations that you can take, too. You can choose from a wide array of adventures while you experience the nudist lifestyle.There are travel packages available that include excursions such as hiking, tennis, and water sports.
If you choose to visit a nudist resort, you should be aware that many people will spend the entire time sans clothing. Be prepared to eat your meals and check your e-mail with people who are unclothed.

, There are many people who go to nude beaches and resorts on their own. This is a perfectly acceptable option if that is within your comfort zone. But if you are nervous to be naked in front of strangers for the first time, you might feel better if you take along a trusted friend or family member.


Think carefully about who you want to invite on the trip. The person you choose should be open-minded and open to the same experience as you. Talk about your expectations before you book any travel arrangements.

, This might seem strange, since you won't need to bring many clothes. But there are actually a lot of essentials you want to remember if you are visiting a nude beach or resort. For the beach, your most important item is your towel. You don't want to be completely naked on the sand all day--it's not comfortable.You should also make sure to bring plenty of sunscreen. You are going to be getting a lot of sun, and some areas of your body won't be used to the exposure. Make sure to fully lotion up several times a day.
Weather can be unpredictable. If it grows suddenly cold or rainy, you'll want to be able to add layers of clothing. As with any trip, try to pack for the unexpected cold snap.
Most nudist resorts and beaches frown upon cameras, for obvious reasons. You can leave this item at home, unless explicitly told that it is okay to bring.

, There are many rules to follow when you are visiting a nudist area. Some are unwritten, but some are explicitly stated. Think about things that would make you uncomfortable while you are sunbathing nude. Then avoid doing those things. Pay attention to the behavior of others, and conform to social niceties.


Some nudist resorts are adults only. If it doesn't specifically say that in the site's promotional materials, feel free to inquire. If you want your children to visit a nude beach, find an area that is kid friendly. This is much more common in Europe than it is in the United States.
Avoid staring at others. No one likes to be gawked at. Pay attention to yourself, and those you came with.
Don't make the situation sexual. Nudists are there because they embrace the freedom of the lifestyle, not because they are seeking a romantic encounter.
Don't be an exhibitionist. This means not engaging in any sexual activity in front of others, or engaging in any physical acts that could be considered lewd.

, Many people cite growing confidence as one of the major benefits of nudism. Even though it might be uncomfortable your first time, try to be confident in your own skin. You will soon realize that nudism isn't about looking a certain way--it is about feeling at ease. No one expects you to have a perfect body, so just feel good about what you have.


Give yourself a pep talk before stripping down. Think of your favorite part of yourself and concentrate on that. Are your legs strong from doing a lot of walking lately? Let that be your focus.

, One of the main components of the nudist community is acceptance. You don't want to be judged by others, so make sure to practice that same mindset. Avoid thinking about people's physical attributes and instead focus on your own experience. Go into this knowing that you will see all types of bodies.Nudists believe that human bodies are beautiful. Make this your mindset, too.

, This should be an enjoyable experience. After all, it is a day at that beach or a vacation. Try to treat it like you would treat any other sun filled excursion. Take your usual beach materials, such as an engaging book or some music.


Don't be hard on yourself. If you feel uncomfortable at first, give yourself some time to start enjoying the experience.

, Exploring the nudist lifestyle is a great way to feel empowered. It can be exhilarating to experience an extended period of time not worrying about what you are wearing or what you look like. Research shows that nudists generally have high levels of self-esteem.Take some time to enjoy the experience. Think about how great it feels to be in a new environment and the new sensations that you are experiencing.

, One of the major components of nudist resorts and beaches is that the people who frequent them are generally very open-minded people. Knowing that you are not being judged is a great way to help you feel relaxed and more confident. It is a place where body image is not relevant.People naturally observe other people's clothing. When no one has any on, it removes one of the things that we tend to judge.

, Trying something new is beneficial for your mind. Trying something new requires you to be brave, which is a good trait to have. New experiences also require to you grow mentally. Your mind will absorb new emotions as you try new things.Trying something new is the only way that you can find something new to enjoy.

Breathe deeply and evenly during the movement.,
Remain on the floor for 2-3 minutes before getting up after the machine stops.,Stretch out your spine and hips, then roll to one side and get up off the floor.,Drink a full glass of water.",How to Use the Chi Machine,", Make sure there is room underneath the machine for air movement.,

If you have low back or knee pain, place a pillow underneath your knees for extra support until your body becomes accustomed to the movement.

,, Make sure the ankle bone is about 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) over the edge of the cradle so your feet can move freely back and forth., There are a few variations you can try:

Stretched Back Position: Place both arms above your head and keep them as straight as possible. This may assist with weight loss, shoulder tendinitis, releasing muscle tension, and releasing nervous pressure.
Mid Position: Place both hands under your head in a position that results in your upper body and legs being slightly lifted off the floor. This may assist with migraine headaches, bone spurs, misaligned spine, sore back, gout, and arthritis.

Hum to yourself.,
Chant “OM” or “AUM.” Chanting has been used by many cultures throughout history to uplift the spirit.,
Use toning as a form of therapy.",How to Use Sound for Therapy1," If you suffer from sinusitis and upper respiratory issues, try humming to yourself. A study conducted by a Swedish researcher found that humming increases ventilation in the paranasal sinus cavities. The increased flow of oxygen promotes healthy blood circulation in the paranasal sinus cavities, and thus, can decrease sinus and respiratory infections.Find a quiet place. Close your eyes, straighten your neck and spine, and relax your shoulders. Gently touch your lips together and relax your jaw. Take a deep, slow breath in. As you exhale, create an “mmm” sound without opening your lips. Hum for the length of your exhale. Continue the breathing and humming for a minute. Eventually work your way up to 15 minutes.;
, Today, research studies reveal that chanting can stabilize your heart rate, improve circulation, lower your blood pressure, produce endorphins, and aid the process of metabolism.Take a deep breath in. As you exhale, chant the sound “OM” or “Aaa-Uuu-Mmm.” If you chant “AUM,” feel the “Aaa” in your stomach, the “Uuu” in your chest, and the “Mmm” in your head. When you run out of breath, breathe in again and repeat the chant., Toning is slightly different from humming and chanting. While chanting is used as a general therapy for the whole body, you can use toning to direct healing to certain areas of your body. For example, if you have a problem with your stomach, and you know the sound relating to the stomach, you can activate the healing process by chanting the sound and directing the vibration to your stomach area. You can promote healing in certain areas of your body by humming:""Mmm"" for the sinuses.
""Nnn"" for the ears.
""Eemm"" for the eyes.
""Lmm"" for the nose.
""Pamm"" for the stomach.
""Ma"" for the heart.
""Kaa-Gaa-Gha"" for the throat.
If you do not know the specific sound for a body part, then hum or chant any of the vowel sounds. Direct its vibration into the area of the body that needs healing.

, Turn on your television, set your work or other duties aside and take a deep breath. Computers are also helpful in procrastination because it can distract you of the worries it may cause later.

, Music has a way of reaching one's soul, and if you purchase the ""soothing sounds of nature,"" it can be guaranteed that you will find yourself in an aura of utter and complete relaxation where even your biggest worry seems like a small ant in a room full of anteaters. If you can still hear your other surroundings, turn your volume up, shut your windows and your door, or tell them to quiet down.

, Water and tea work best when trying to relax, as caffeine usually stimulates the person and causes them to be anxious.

Close your eyes.,
Visualize an image in your head.Choose a calming scene or one that you take comfort in.,
Gradually fill in visual details.,
Introduce sound details.,
Imagine the smells.,
Think about the way things physically feel.,
Focus on one detail.,
Avoid making emotional judgments.",How to Get Balance With Visual Meditation2," For subjective visual meditation, you will be focusing on a visual image inside your mind. It will be easier to focus on an imaginary scene if you do not have a tangible scene in front of your eyes to distract you.


If you begin to feel as though you might fall asleep, however, you should open your eyes. You need to be relaxed during meditation, but being that relaxed will prevent you from focusing on the exercise.

, Scenes that include water have a tendency to be especially relaxing. For instance, you could visualize a forest with a stream running through it or a sandy ocean beach.

, Once you have the basic image in mind, visualize smaller details to make the image more realistic.


If using a beach image, visualize bits of shells or stones that have washed up on shore or seagulls flying in the distance. Avoid visualizing people or man-made structures.
If using a forest scene, visualize various plant life. Imagine looking at the stream in your forest and peering down into the clear water and looking at the pebbles underneath.

, Once you have a clear visualization, give the scene greater life by imagining the types of sound you might expect to hear.


For a beach visualization, imagine the sound of crashing waves and seagulls.
For a forest visualization, think about the sound of the babbling brook, birds singing in the distance, or the breeze as it rushes through the trees.

, Smells can be a difficult sense to imagine, but if you chose a scene that you are familiar enough with in the real world, it will be easier to tap into your memory bank.


Imagine the smell of salt water at the beach or the smell of fresh flowers in a forest.

, The sense of touch is the final sensory detail you will need to complete the visualization exercise. Make full use of your sense of touch, imagining the way things feel on your feet, hands, or face.


When you visualize yourself on the beach, imagine the feeling of warm sand on your soles and brisk wind tickling the rest of your skin.
When visualizing yourself in a forest, imagine the cool soil and grass in between your toes. Bend down in your scene and feel the water in the stream with your hands.

, Once you have managed to complete the scene to the best of your ability, filling in as many details as possible, narrow your focus back down to one specific detail. Do not make it a broad, general object, such as the ocean or the stream. Instead, focus on a minor detail that you may not have noticed if you had not first expanded the scene. For example, you could focus on a small, luminescent stone lying on the shore of the beach or a tiny silverfish swimming in your forest’s stream.

, If any of the details you imagine trigger an emotional response, acknowledge the emotion and release it by refocusing your attention back on the visualization itself. In doing so, you release the feelings that leave you imbalanced, making your overall mental state more balanced in the process.

Place a simple object in front of you.,
Stare at the object.,
Fixate on the visual qualities of the object.,
Imagine the non-visual qualities of the object.,
Acknowledge and dismiss feelings.",How to Get Balance With Visual Meditation3," You can select a more complex image, like a landscape photograph or the picture of an important religious figure, but simple objects tend to be easier to work with when specifically trying to achieve a sense of balance. A good object to start with would be a candle or a clear crystal.

, Keep your eyes partially open but not wide. Fixate on the object without thinking or making any observations for several minutes. If you catch your eyes or mind beginning to wander, snap your attention back to the object. Continue staring until your mind wanders significantly less.

, Once your mind is completely fixated on the object, make note of its visual qualities.


For a lit candle, make note of the way the wax drips down the side, the way the flame wiggles, and the way the light of the flame looks.
For a crystal, note how clear the crystal is. Look at its angles and the way the crystal has been cut, and consider other objects the crystal reminds you of, like water.

, Sound and smell are already present, so focus your energy on imagining the sense of touch. It is important that you only imagine the sense, rather than extending your hand out to the object and actually touching it.


For a flame, imagine its warmth. For a crystal, imagine how heavy it might feel and whether it would be cool or warm to the touch.

, If any emotions are triggered during the exercise, acknowledge their presence before quickly dismissing them. Do not linger on the feelings or stop to analyze them. Acknowledge the emotions that make you feel imbalanced and release them to achieve a more complete state of balance.

Purchase a singing bowl.,
Hold the singing bowl and grasp the mallet.,
Rub the mallet clockwise.",How to Use Sound for Therapy2," You can purchase a metal or crystal singing bowl online. You can also visit your local apothecary; they might have singing bowls for purchase. A singing bowl sings when you run a felt-tipped mallet around the bowl’s edges. The vibrations produced by the bowl can slow down your breathing, heart rate, and brain waves. This can produce a deep sense of calm and well-being., In the palm of your hand, hold the singing bowl. Then, grasp the mallet at mid-length with your palm facing downward, i.e., with all your fingertips facing downward and touching the wood. Gently tap the side of the singing bowl with the mallet. This is called warming up the bell.Hold smaller singing bowls, i.e., seven inches and under, on your fingertips.

, Using a full arm movement, like stirring a big pot, rub the mallet clockwise along the outside edge of the bowl’s rim. Use even pressure as you rub the mallet on the outside edge of the bowl’s rim. Make sure the mallet is positioned vertically, i.e., straight up and down.It is not a wrist movement, but a full arm movement.
Remember to apply pressure. The friction of the mallet against the singing bowl’s outer rim is what produces the vibration and the sound.
Try not to go too fast. Let the sound build up slowly as the bowl picks up the vibrations.

Take a deep breath.,
Practice yoga or meditation.,
Get a massage.,
Get enough sleep.",How to Stop Shaking1," An excess of adrenaline can cause your body to shake. This shaking will probably be most noticeable in your hands and legs. If you find that you are shaking as a result of a fear or nervousness, the best thing that you can do is take a deep breath. Deep breathing stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system, which is associated with sleep and relaxation. By taking a few deep breaths, you can put yourself into a more relaxed state.Inhale a long, deep breath through your nose and hold it for a few seconds. Then, exhale through your mouth.
Take several deep breaths to help yourself calm down. If you are able, recline or lay down for a few minutes to make your deep breathing even more effective.;
, Stress and anxiety may be the cause of your shaking or it may be making your shaking worse. Relaxation techniques like yoga and meditation can help you stop shaking by reducing stress and anxiety. Try taking a beginner yoga or meditation class to see how it helps your shaking., Massage has been shown to reduce shaking in people who have essential tremor, a condition that causes the arms, legs, and head to shake at all times. In the study, the intensity of the subject’s shaking decreased right after the massage.Whether you shake from stress and anxiety or from essential tremor, you may get some relief by having regular massages. Try a massage to see if it stops your shaking.

, Not getting enough sleep can cause your hands and legs to shake or make shaking worse if you have an essential tremor.Make sure that you get the recommended amount of sleep every night. Teenagers need between 8.5 and 9.5 hours of sleep per night, while adults need between 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night."
"
If possible, disengage from your stressor(s).,
Take a bubble bath.,
Take in some fresh air.,
Fill your mind with positive feelings.,
Choose your response.",How to Stay Relaxed in Times of Stress1," One way to be more relaxed is to, when possible, remove yourself from the situation. For example, if you are in a big fight with your partner, you could excuse yourself and say something like ""This is really stressing me out and I just need a 30 minute break to help clear my head and calm down, then I will gladly continue the conversation."" Keep in mind that it may not always be possible to disengage from your stressful situation, but try to look for little breaks where you can get them.;
, Use your favorite shampoo or bubble bath formula and let the bubbles fill the tub. Just sink in and close your eyes and do your best to get your mind off whatever has been stressing you out.


Try to keep in mind that, in the current moment, all that matters is you enjoying and relaxing in your bath. You can deal with your problems another time; what matters now is pure relaxation.

, Try to let your mind go free while thinking of the nature that you are in. If it is sunny out, soak up those rays. If it is raining, listen closely to the pounding of the raindrops on the things in your environment. If it is cold, watch your breath as you breathe slowly in and out. The key is to be present in the moment, with nature, so as to clear your mind from what you are stressed about.


Studies show that being in awe of nature can be good for your health; this can combat the negative health impacts of stress and help increase your well-being., Stress and negative feelings often go hand in hand; one way to be more relaxed and combat your stress is to try to make yourself feel happier with some tricks of the trade. There are a few different ways to feel more positive:


Try smiling. The facial feedback hypothesis suggests there is a bi-directional relationship between the facial muscles and emotions. While typically you feel happy and so smile, you can also smile to feel happy.To force yourself to smile, you can try holding a pencil between your teeth so that the eraser part is at the left side of your mouth and the writing part is at the right side of your mouth.
Spend money or some of your time on other people. Research shows that doing so can increase the happiness of the donor.Do some physical activity to get your endorphin levels up, which can make you feel happier., Generally, you can do one of two things when faced with stress: you can try to change the situation or your response to it.Sometimes, you may be powerless to change the source of your stress, but in these cases you can still choose how to respond to the stressors. Consider some questions when deciding your approach.


Can you avoid the stressor? This isn't always appropriate — if you are always fighting with your husband and choose to get up and leave the room instead of working out your issues, then avoidance is not a good tactic. But if your stressor is a coworker who has no influence over your work or isn't a part of your team, then it may be smart to avoid him in order to keep your own stress levels down. Another example of when avoidance is appropriate is if you are stressed out by traffic — avoid the congestion by taking the train or going to work earlier, thereby avoiding the weekday traffic jam.
Can you alter the stressor in some way? While some stressors can’t be avoided, in some cases you can still alter the stressor to some degree. For example, you and your romantic partner will have disagreements at some point; this is natural for all relationships, even the best of them. However, these arguments can be less stressful if you and your partner have made a plan or discussed how to deal with conflict. For example, you may agree to go to separate rooms to calm yourselves down during a heated argument; use ""I"" language do express your feelings; never blame or shame or use negative language (""You never..."", ""You always..."", ""It really sucks when...""); avoid yelling and name-calling; agree to disagree and/or compromise; and so on.
Can you adapt to the stressor? Sometimes you can change your behavior to reduce stress, even if you can’t change the situation. Again using the example of rush-hour traffic, if you frequently find yourself stressed by rush-hour traffic, you can’t change that: you have to get to work, and rush-hour traffic is a worldwide problem. However, you could alter your approach by taking the bus to work, changing your driving route, or leaving at a time outside the window of rush hour traffic.
Can you accept the stressor? Some stressors can't be changed or altered. For example, you largely can't change others' behavior or thoughts. Or, you can’t change that it rained on your wedding day. However, you can work to accept these as things beyond your control and let go of your need to control them. You can also view them as learning experiences from which you can grow.
You can combine these responses to resolve your stress. We often use many techniques at once throughout the day to cope with one problem or issue.

Breathe deeply.,
Focus your mind on a soothing word.,
Exercise.,
Relax your muscles.,
Get social.",How to Stay Relaxed in Times of Stress2," This is a relaxation technique that involves deep abdominal breathing. Breathing deeply increases the flow of oxygen to the brain, stimulating your parasympathetic nervous system; this helps activate your relaxation response, which slows your heartbeat, lowers your blood pressure, and relaxes your muscles.To engage in this relaxation technique: Place one hand on your lower abdomen just below your ribs and one on your chest.Inhale slowly through your nose. Try to breathe in for 4 seconds if you can. You should feel your stomach and chest expand as you inhale.
Hold the breath for 1-2 seconds. Then, slowly exhale through your nose or mouth. Try to exhale for 4 seconds if you can. Repeat this process around 8 times per minute for a few minutes or until you feel more relaxed.

, You may also try focusing your mind on a single soothing word such as calm or peace. Repeat this word in your mind several times over the course of 5 minutes. If you are having trouble focusing on the word, try visualizing a representation of that word. So, if your word is ""calm,"" try to picture a tranquil lake. This can have a similar effect, activating your relaxation response., Studies show that getting exercise is a great way to combat stress and so feel more relaxed. Go for a run, go to the gym, or join in on an activity such as basketball, ball hockey, or softball to help you break a sweat and reduce your stress levels.Try listening to upbeat music as you exercise to improve your workout.

, Stress can cause you to tense your muscles, which can feedback and make you feel even more stressed. Using progressive muscle relaxation, or PMR, can allow you to release that tension and make you feel more relaxed. There are free PMR routines online that you can follow along with such as:

Berkeley's routine MIT's guide Find a quiet, comfortable place if you can, but this is not required for some PMR techniques.
Loosen tight clothing if you can. Sit comfortably and breathe in and out in even amounts as you do PMR.
Start with your facial muscles, as this is a common area of tension. Begin by opening your eyes as wide as they will go and hold that for five seconds, then slowly release the tension. Next, squeeze your eyes shut tightly for five seconds, then slowly release the tension. Give yourself 10 seconds to notice how these areas feel after performing those exercises.
Move to the next group. Purse your lips tightly for five seconds, then release slowly. Next, smile as wide as you possibly can for five seconds, then release slowly. Again, let yourself feel your now more relaxed muscles for around 10 seconds before moving on.
Continue to tense muscle groups for five seconds and then release the tension. Give yourself a 10 second relaxation break between groups.
Progress through the rest of your muscle groups as you see fit: neck, shoulders, arms, chest, stomach, buttocks, thighs, lower legs, feet, and toes.
If you don't have time for a full PMR exercise, try to do just your facial muscles. You can also try a quick hand massage, since we often carry stress-related tension in our hands.

, One way to combat stress is to engage with your family and friends. Studies show that social support can buffer against stress. Call up a friend or family member and make some plans with them. Discuss what is eating at you. If that doesn't work, try getting your mind off of your situation entirely and instead focus on enjoying your friend's company.

Think about future plans.,
Daydream to relieve yourself from boredom.,
Allow your mind to make random connections.,
Take a mental vacations.,
Focus in situations where it's necessary.,
Zone out to alleviate boredom.,
Let your mind wander when you're feeling stressed.,
Take a break from a creative task to do an activity that allows you to zone out.,
Problem solve during menial tasks.,
Zone out in moderation.",How to Zone Out," One of the most effective means to remove yourself from the current moment and zone out is by thinking about future plans. If you find yourself stressed or frustrated in a situation, think about your future.When you're doing a menial task at work, think to the future. What do you want to be doing later tonight? What do you want to be doing a year from now? How do you want your life to unfold? Indulge in some daydreams of a happy future for yourself.
Some studies indicate zoning out and thinking of the future has some evolutionary benefit. It helps us get a clear sense of what we want, allowing us to make serious plans to achieve our goals. Researchers also find people who zone out to focus on the future have higher working memories.;
, Daydreaming can be a great way to reduce boredom in a given situation. Daydreaming while waiting for the bus or waiting at the pharmacy can allow you to escape the inherent boredom of the situation. Strive to daydream only in situations where your full attention is not necessary.Daydream about things that are realistic. Studies show that people who daydream about things that are unobtainable tend to be more unhappy. Focus your daydreams on your current relationships and things that could very well happen in the near future. For example, daydream about going to brunch with your closest friends.
Daydreaming can help you improve your memory if you focus your daydreams on your current situation. Daydreaming about faraway places and fantasy lands can be harmful to memory. However, you can instead focus your daydreams on places and people that surround you. This can help sharpen your memory as you'll have to imagine faces and images that are familiar to you.

, One of the biggest advantages of zoning out is that you make connection when you do so. If you're thinking intellectually when zoning out, you may make unexpected connections between disparate themes.Let your mind explore intellectual reveries. If you're trying to read a book, for example, you may suddenly be reminded of another novel, forming a literary connection between the two works.
Instead of cutting off this trail, allow your mind to pursue this thought. Zoning out while reading may allow you to make a connection you would otherwise miss.

, While you should generally daydream about realistic things, it's okay to occasionally take a mental vacation if you're growing very bored. You may, for example, find your mind wandering to a fantasy world from a book and imagining what it would be like to inhabit that space. You may read about a location in Russia and imagine what it would be like to travel there. If you're very bored, and do not have work to do, taking a mental vacation can occasionally be helpful. It may also be very helpful if you're stressed, as this form of escapism can help shut out the outside world.Keep in mind, however, daydreams should mostly be realistic in nature. Limit more fantastic mental vacations to occasions of extreme stress and boredom.
If you want to keep your mind grounded in the realistic, take a mental vacation to a place you've already been. Visit a favorite childhood vacation spot, for example.

, Zoning out is not a good idea for every situation. You want to make sure you're able to focus when you need to, and you do not use zoning out as an excuse to shirk your responsibilities.Do not zone out during times when you need to concentrate. Zoning out during work or school, or while taking a test, is a bad idea. You should also not zone out in conversation with another person, as this can be considered rude.
Avoid zoning out when doing tasks like driving. This could potentially cause a dangerous situation.

, If you're feeling bored, zoning out can be incredibly helpful. Sometimes, at work, school, or in your daily errands, you'll find there are moments where your mind does not need to be occupied. If a task does not necessarily excite you or require heavy focus, mind-wandering can help make time go by faster.There are little tasks we have to do every day that can get cumbersome. While you're chopping onions for dinner, it's appropriate to zone out for a moment.
Life is full of dull moments that can be made better by zoning out. For example, you may have downtime during work for about half an hour each Wednesday. This would be a good time to let your mind wander.

, Zoning out can be a great way to relieve stress as well as boredom. If you're butting heads with a task, you may be so frustrated you're not getting anything done. Try taking a break and zoning out for half an hour. Then, return to the task with a fresh mind and see if your performance improves., Creative types tend to benefit the most from zoning out. If you're struggling with a creative task, like writing an essay or a poem, zoning out can be hugely beneficial. Studies show creative people benefit from zoning out due to unconscious thought. Even when a problem or work is not directly on your mind, it's in the background. The random thoughts you experience when zoning out may help you find the inspiration necessary to complete a problem.If you're struggling with a creative project, stop. Allow yourself to have some distance from the work. Do an activity that allows you to zone out. Go for a walk. Take a bath. Le on the couch and close your eyes for a bit.
You'll have a variety of random thoughts when you zone out that may connect to the task at hand. While you may not directly see the connections playing out, you may find it's easier to concentrate when you return to the work. You may find it's easier to complete the projects, as you'll suddenly be seeing connections in the work that you missed before.

, There are many menial tasks we have to do throughout the day. Things like doing dishes, doing laundry, showering, and more do not require our full attention. These are prime opportunities for zoning out in a way that encourages problem solving.If you're having an ongoing issue, address it when zoning out during menial tasks. You do not need to focus on washing dishes, as it's likely something you do every day. Instead, turn your attention to problems that are weighing on your mind.
Say you've been having a conflict with a coworker. As you zone out, think of ways to solve the problem. Imagine successful interactions with this person. Try to put yourself in your coworkers shoes. You may find zoning out during dull moments helps you see solutions you previously missed.

, You should not zone out all the time. While zoning out in moderation can reduce stress and improve memory, constant zoning out tends to make people unhappy. Most people are happier when they're focused for much of the day and zone out only in moderation.If you've been zoning out for much of the day, try to find ways to focus your attention on the present. You could, for example, observe your surroundings using all your senses. You could also read a book, do a crossword puzzle, or do another mentally demanding task.

Cut your caffeine intake.,
Avoid drinking alcohol.,
Eat lightly.",How to Sleep Before an Exciting Event1," Caffeine can stay in your bloodstream for 4-6 hours. This means that if you drink caffeine within 4-6 hours before bedtime, the caffeine will keep you awake as you’re trying to fall asleep. Avoid drinking anything with caffeine at least 6 hours before bedtime. Some studies suggest cutting caffeine out at least twelve hours before you go to sleep.Caffeine is also a diuretic, which means that drinking it before you go to bed will cause more bathroom trips through the night.

Take a risk.,
Do something that scares you.,
Go to a haunted house.",How to Get an Adrenaline Rush1," Scary movies are by nature designed to make people fearful. If you are bothered by frightening stimuli in a scary movie, this may encourage a fight or flight response. This can cause your body to release epinephrine.If you want to get an adrenaline rush, watch a scary movie online or rent a DVD.


Choose a theme that genuinely bothers you. If zombies have never really scared you, marathoning The Walking Dead is unlikely to encourage an adrenaline rush. However, if you have a longstanding fear of the paranormal you may be frightened by a movie like The Ring.

Pay attention to outside opinions. Certain movies are generally considered scary by critics and audiences. Psycho, Night of the Living Dead, Alien, and The Exorcist are considered amongst the scariest films of all time.If you want an adrenaline rush, a movie with a lot of jump scares and surprise moments might be better than something's that frightening on a psychological level. Remember, you're trying to stimulate a fight or flight response so something that's direct and action-based will work best. Go for a scary movie with a lot of action. For example, a film from the Halloween franchise might be a better option than Rosemary Baby.;
, If you're really into a computer or video game, you may get an adrenaline rush. Violent games tend to result in the release of adrenaline. Consider renting or purchasing an action-packed game with a high level of gore and violence. Military games and first person shooter games often encourage the release of adrenaline in the body., Risk-taking on occasion can release adrenaline in the body.In addition to causing an adrenaline rush, periodically taking small risks is healthy as it encourages you to step outside your comfort zone.


The idea here is not to do something that could potentially hurt you. Closing your eyes while driving will certainly give you an adrenaline rush, but it's absolutely not worth the risk. Instead, stick to behaviors that would normally make you uncomfortable.
Ask someone out on a date. Sing karaoke at a bar. Dance with a stranger. Buy a lottery ticket. Audition for a play. Anything that feels risky to you can cause an adrenaline rush.
If you're interested in a bigger rush, there a certain behaviors that provide a kind of controlled risk. Things like bungee jumping and ski diving, for example, feel risky as you're falling from large heights. However, as long as you're working with an experienced sky diver or bungee jumper you should be safe. If you choose to engage in such activities, work with a trained professional and follow all safety instructions exactly.

, Fear can also stimulate the release of adrenaline.Facing your fears periodically, in safe and controlled situations, can provide you with a nice adrenaline rush.


Think of something that scares you. If you're afraid of heights, for example, makes plans to go to a rooftop bar with friends. If you have a longstanding fear of dogs, go to a local dog park. Expose yourself to small things that scare you. This can result in the fight or flight response that can trigger an adrenaline rush.

, Haunted houses can often cause adrenaline rushes for those in attendance. This can trigger the fight or flight response that releases adrenaline. The nice thing about a haunted house is that it's a controlled setting. You can expose yourself to scary stimuli while knowing logically you are still safe, allowing you to experience an adrenaline rush without genuine anxiety or fear.Seasonally, it's easiest to find a haunted house around Halloween. However, keep your eyes open throughout the year. Some organizations may do haunted houses as part of special benefits or fundraisers during odd seasons.
If you live near an amusement park, there may be a haunted house attraction that's opened year-round.

Avoid a fight.,
Try not to get defensive.,
Stay in the present.,
Stay calm and quiet.,
Apologize if you were in the wrong.,
Don’t say “calm down.” Someone who is really angry is being ruled by his emotions and is not accessing the rational part of his brain.,

Get to safety if the situation turns violent.",How to Calm an Angry Person," When someone else is at a boiling point, getting equally angry is only going to make matters worse. Focus on keeping yourself calm, or else the situation might quickly spiral into an argument. This is not to say you should act completely unemotional, but try not to let your own feelings get too heated.


A way to remain neutral is to let go of your own ego and not take things personally.It can be natural to respond to an angry person by defending yourself or your reputation, but it’s important to remember that someone who is very angry cannot be reasoned with until they have calmed down.;
, When someone’s so mad they can barely speak in a level tone, it’s easy to absorb that negativity and feel defensive. When you’re communicating with someone who is angry, realize that the anger is likely not about you.Separate the person’s emotions from your own so you can be there for the person without feeling the anger is directed toward you.

, People who are angry will often bring up situations or conversations from the past, particularly if they are trying to draw you into their anger.Try to counteract that by keeping them focused on the present situation and solving a solution to the current problem. Don’t let yourself get drawn in to feeling angry about past events.


If the conversation seems to be drifting towards past events, try saying something like, “We can talk about that later. I think right now, we should focus on what is immediately upsetting you and finding a solution to that problem. Let’s take one thing at a time.”

, If someone is yelling or venting, you can decide to let them vent to blow off steam, but the best thing for you to do is to remain quiet or to say nothing. If you do speak, keep a quiet level voice. If you remain quiet, try to keep a neutral facial expression and open body language. You remain in more control if you do not react to the “bait” of the person yelling.There is a difference between letting someone vent and being the victim of verbal abuse. If the person is berating you, calling you names, or directing unrelated anger towards you, you may want to make a statement such as, “I understand that you are frustrated and I would like to be here for you. But please do not take your anger out on me.”

, If you did something to anger the person, maybe what they need is a heartfelt apology. Apologizing is not a sign of weakness. It shows that you care about the feelings of the other person.Reflect on the situation to see if you did something wrong, and if you did, say you’re sorry. Sometimes that’s all a person needs to hear to feel better about what happened.


If you don’t feel you were in the wrong, however, then don’t apologize just to calm the person down.
An effective apology may be, “I’m very sorry that I spent the money you were saving for retirement on a time share in Hawaii. I don’t know what I was thinking, and I can understand why you are angry. Let’s work together to find a solution.”

, Trying to use reason or making suggestions to “remain calm” or “be reasonable” are likely to fuel the fire and make the person feel invalidated., When people are feeling emotional they want to know someone else understands. Really listen to the person talk. Look him or her in the eye, nod when appropriate, and ask questions to find out more. The act of conversing and feeling heard could help the person calm down.


Of course, sometimes angry people don’t want to be asked questions, and they might feel so angry they don’t believe anyone can really understand. All you can do is try your best; if the person isn't in the mood for a heart-to-heart, don’t force it.

, Everyone gets angry from time to time. Sometimes anger actually masks another emotion, like feeling hurt, embarrassed, or sad. Whatever the reason for the person’s anger, listen to him and respond by validating his feelings (without necessarily agreeing with him). You should also withhold judgment of the person, as judging will likely come through in your words or body language as a lack of support.


An example of validating someone’s emotions is making statements like “that must be difficult” or “I understand how you could be frustrated.”
Statements that are not as helpful include “you should let it go” or “I experienced the same thing and got over it.”

, Empathy can take the form of understanding another’s perspective, feeling distress at the plight of another person, and being able to relate to the emotions of another.Showing empathy towards someone who is angry may take the form of showing that you have been listening to him and know what he is saying.To empathize with someone who is angry, try paraphrasing the source of their anger back to them. You might say, “So, you are saying that you feel angry because you think you have to take on all of the household responsibilities alone.”
You may be inclined to say, “I understand how you feel,” but know that this can sometimes make someone more angry. They may believe that no one really knows how they feel.

, You may have to read the situation or know the angry person fairly well to determine whether this approach will work. Humor can effectively fight anger because it changes the chemical processes in the body. Making a joke or stopping and pointing out something funny in the situation and getting both of you laughing can diffuse the situation and could potentially snap the person out of his anger.

, Some people are talkers, and some people prefer to process their emotions alone. If the idea of talking it out just seems to make the person madder, give them some space and time instead. Most people take at least 20 minutes to calm down from anger, but some may need even longer.If you think someone needs some time alone, try saying, “I understand that you are angry, but I don’t feel like I am helping you feel any better, and I think you may need a few minutes to yourself. I’ll be right here for you if or when you feel ready to talk.”

, If the source of the anger is related to a solvable problem, maybe you can help. If the person is calm enough to listen to reason, offer solutions and help to lay out a plan that will correct the situation.In some cases, an angry person can’t be reasoned with in this way. Assess the situation and determine whether you should wait until the person has calmed down enough to listen to positive reasoning.

, It is important to focus on the present when processing feelings of anger, but you should try to get the person to focus on the future when finding a solution.This can help the person think more reasonably and focus on the improved results from the solution instead of continuing to dwell in the anger of the past or present.

, Not every problem or situation that makes someone angry has a solution. If this is the case, it’s important to emphasize that the person needs to work through his emotions and move on. , If the person is pushing your buttons or enticing you to feel angry, you should leave if possible. Becoming angry yourself will likely cause the situation to worsen, so leaving when you feel angry can prevent an escalation or fight., Anger and abuse are not the same things. Anger is a normal human emotion that needs to be dealt with. Abuse is an unhealthy and potentially dangerous way of interacting with another. The following are strategies that indicate abuse, not anger:Physical intimidation (whether or not it leads to actual violence)
Making you feel guilty
Calling names or belittling
Sexual control or coercion, If you’re dealing with a person who has anger management problems and you fear for your safety, leave right away and get to a safe place. Domestic abuse is an ongoing cycle, and if abuse happens once it’s likely to happen again. It’s very important for you to keep yourself and your family physically and emotionally safe.In the US, the domestic abuse hotline is 1-800-799-7233 (SAFE).Here are the signs that the situation might be abusive:


You feel afraid of making the person angry
The person humiliates you, criticizes you or puts you down
The person has a violent and unpredictable temper
The person blames you for his or her abusive behavior
The person threatens to hurt you

Exercise early.,
Read a relaxing book.,
Listen to soothing and relaxing music.,
Set aside time to think about the day.,
Stretch your muscles.,
Take a hot bath.,
Use breathing exercises.While you lay in bed, put your arms at your side.,
Get more sunlight during the day.",How to Sleep Before an Exciting Event2," Exercise will help you fall asleep, but you want to do it at least six hours before bedtime. Since exercise raises your body’s temperature for 5-6 hours, it can keep you awake. Your body’s temperature needs to drop so that you can sleep.The exercise will help to make you more exhausted, thus helping you fall asleep.
Try jogging.
Weight training can also help.

, Try to read for thirty minutes to an hour before you go to bed. Avoid reading an exciting book as this could stimulate you and keep you awake. Read under a dim light so that your mind relaxes.Avoid reading from a back-lit device. If you are reading an electronic book, try to read it on a device that requires additional lighting.
If you find yourself falling asleep, let yourself.

, Make sure the music has a slow tempo and is an instrumental. Avoid listening to anything loud, as it will wake you up. Listen to the music in a different room so that you don’t have to worry about getting up to turn it off. This works like a lullaby.Try using “nature sounds”. Buy or download a CD or MP3 which has several hours of rainstorms, ocean sounds, rushing wind or birds.
What you consider relaxing may vary. Some people find death metal relaxing and are very annoyed by smooth jazz or whale calls. Make sure to choose something right for you.

, Plan to set aside fifteen minutes before you go to bed to let your mind go through everything that happened during the day. Make sure you do this before you go to bed to avoid tossing and turning over these thoughts as you’re trying to fall asleep. If you still have things on your mind at the end of this time, write them down.If you have trouble sleeping because your mind is going over the big event or something stressful, write down what you need to do. Keep a paper pad beside your bed, and when you wake up, write down what needs to be done. This will help set your mind at ease.Sometimes this can be done in the form of a prayer. Talk through your day in the manner of your regular religious conveyance. Prayer varies widely between religions. If you are unsure how to pray in your religion, talk to your community leaders.

, This will help your muscles relax, which will help you sleep faster. You only need to do a few basic stretches for it to have an optimal effect. Stretching will also prevent muscle cramping, which can wake you up in the middle of the night.


Try doing some yoga-like stretches. Look up poses online.
Stretch like a cat. This means randomly stretching parts of your body that feel tight. Think about how cats stretch when you are trying.

, Taking a long bath will help relax muscles and relieve pain. Avoid showers as they wake you up instead of helping you sleep.Part of this may be due to the fact that many people associate showering with getting up in the morning. Adding a few drops of essential oils, such as lavender, can help relax you.

, Monitor your breathing and watch your abdomen move up and down as you breathe. As you breathe in, tense a part of your body such as your leg muscles. When you breathe out, relax that part of your body. Do this from your head to your toes.


Take a meditation class, so that you can learn esoteric breathing techniques.
Talk to your doctor or therapist to learn exercises for breathing.

, Your body’s internal clock responds to natural light. As soon as you wake up, seek out sunlight. You can open your curtains or take a short walk outside. Throughout the day, take a break and find some sun. This will help your body start a routine to wind down when it’s dark outside. If sunlight is a limited resource, think of getting a sun lamp. These are available online, and they can help to supplement natural sunlight.
Leave your bedroom blinds open when you go to sleep. This can help you to wake up from light exposure.

Turn off blue light devices.,
Eliminate distractions.,
Keep your bedroom as dark and cool.,
Quiet your surroundings.,
Wear an eye mask and a pair of earplugs.",How to Sleep Before an Exciting Event3," The most commonly used blue light devices are cell phones, tablets, and computer monitors. These devices block your melatonin production, which can cause going to sleep to be much more difficult. Turn off these devices 2-3 hours before you go to sleep.Be careful of night lights.
Streetlights can also contribute.

, Stop checking your email, social media, and text messages an hour and a half before you go to bed. This will help settle your mind before you go to sleep. Turning off these distractions gives your mind time to decompress and focus on sleeping.

, You’re more likely to have nightmares if you sleep in a warm bedroom, which will lead to a restless night. Try to keep the bedroom’s temperature around 65 degrees as that’s the ideal sleeping temperature for your body. Cooler temperatures help induce sleep.Keep your bedroom as dark as possible as even a little light can keep you awake.


Consider getting blackout curtains if there is too much light coming into your bedroom from the outside.Buy a separate air-conditioner to cool the room. This can help you to drastically reduce the temperature.

, Turn off all loud devices or go to a quiet room. If you have trouble eliminating the noise (if it’s coming from outside your house for instance), consider using a fan or white noise to mask the sounds.


Use a radio to create white noise. Put the dial in between radio stations and turn the volume down to a background level.Get noise-canceling headphones by visiting the website of a retailer and ordering them online.

, If you cannot change your environment to be quieter and darker, then use these to block everything out.Cheap earplugs and eye masks may not be as comfortable as higher quality ones. Some people may find that it is difficult to sleep with these items on. This may be due to the fact that the cheap materials or design are uncomfortable.

Take short breaths.,
Engage in action sports.,
Try interval training.,
Engage in a new form of physical activity.,
Drink coffee.",How to Get an Adrenaline Rush2," Physically, taking short rapid breaths can cause an adrenaline rush. This may be because people often breathe quicker in response to danger. If you want to stimulate an adrenaline rush, try taking a few short and quick breathes and see if you feel an increase in your heart rate and overall energy.Be careful. If you feel yourself losing control of your breathing, stop. You do not want to accidentally begin hyperventilating.

, Action sports are a great way to increase adrenaline. Regular physical activity is also great for your overall health. If you're looking for an adrenaline rush, try something like mountain biking, snowboarding, or surfing.For an added effect, pick an activity that scares you a little. This can increase your adrenaline. If you're a little scared of open water, go surfing.You can also try engaging in team action sports, like joining a hockey or football league in your area. Playing a sport that requires a lot of physical exertion as well as contact with other players may release some adrenaline.

, Interval training is a form of exercise where you alternate between an even, steady pace and exerting yourself as much as possible. For example, you may spend 4 minutes biking at a steady pace and then spend 2 minutes biking like you're being chased by a wild animal. Not only can this cause a spike in adrenaline, you'll end up burning more calories and building your overall strength.When first starting interval training, go slowly. The adrenaline released will often make you feel like you can push yourself harder. However, you should stick to 1 to 2 minute intervals of intense training to avoid straining yourself., Simply switching things up can sometimes help release adrenaline. Our brains are naturally wired to fear the unknown. Trying something new can result in a sudden increase in adrenaline. Try a new sport or physical activity in place of your regular work out. See if you notice an adrenaline rush., Coffee can stimulate the adrenal glands in the kidneys, releasing adrenaline and triggering a fight or flight response in your body. This can lead to an adrenaline rush. However, use this method with caution. Too much caffeine too often can result in fatigue, leaving you feeling more tired than you were before your cup of coffee. If you drink coffee, stick to one or two cups at a time."
"
Keep track of your physical symptoms.,
Do not induce an adrenaline rush too often.,
Avoid potentially harmful activities.",How to Get an Adrenaline Rush3," When experiencing an adrenaline rush, take note of your physical symptoms. Usually, an adrenaline rush will pass over on its own. However, be aware of your symptoms and take precautions when necessary.


You may notice an increase in strength. If you're at the gym, for example, you may suddenly be able to lift more weight. You may also feel less pain physically as adrenaline protects our bodies from pain. Be careful when experiencing these symptoms. Try to keep in mind this is an adrenaline rush and you should not overexert yourself. You will feel the pain when the rush passes.You may also notice a sudden boost of energy and rapid breathing. If these symptoms feel extreme, take measures to calm yourself down. Take long, deep breaths. Go somewhere and sit down. Take in the scene around you. This will help take your mind off whatever caused the adrenaline rush., Exposing yourself to extremely high levels of stress over long periods of time is not healthy.Even short-lived stress can cause physical symptoms like stomach cramps, heart palpitations, and an increase in blood pressure.Therefore, do not try to stimulate an adrenaline rush multiple times a day every day. It can be fun and healthy to occasionally push yourself out of your comfort zone but give yourself time to unwind afterwards. For example, watch a funny cartoon show after watching a scary movie.

, Minor risks and scares are a great way to stimulate an adrenaline rush. However, you should not engage in situations that could cause harm to yourself or others simply to get an adrenaline rush. Stick to situations that are safe and controlled.


If you routinely engage in risky behavior in hopes of stimulating adrenaline, talk to a psychiatrist or therapist. This can be a sign of an underlying mental health condition. Borderline personality disorder is especially associated with a tendency towards risky behaviors."

Plan to sleep at the same time every day.,
Plan out what you need for your big event.,
Create a bedtime schedule.",How to Sleep Before an Exciting Event4," If you have a set schedule, then your body is much more likely to sleep even with the stress of a big event. A normal routine lets your body knows when it needs to go to sleep. Some of this may be conditioning, some of it may be natural inclination.Avoid trying to sleep when you’re not tired. If you lay in bed fully awake, then you will toss and turn, which could cause you considerable more stress. If you are still awake after fifteen minutes, get up and find a relaxing activity to do such as light reading.Be rigid. Variability can be ruinous to developing routines.

, It’s best to have everything you need for the big event, like clothes or items, ready long before you go to bed. Avoid staying up late to gather what you need as it will cause stress and keep you up.Write it all down.
Avoid this if you know you have a tendency to be obsessive.

, A ritual will help tell your body that it’s time to go to bed. It will also help clear your head so that your fall asleep faster. Create a schedule for the two hours before bedtime. In this schedule, set-aside 30-minute blocks for relaxing activities.


For instance, if you went to bed at 10 pm, make that the time when you turn off any electronic or blue screen devices is at 8 pm.
At 8 pm, take a warm bath.
At 8:30, take time to reflect on the day and any pressing thoughts.
At 9:00, do a relaxing activity such as reading a book or stretching.
During the last thirty minutes, write down anything that is still troubling your thoughts. Write out possible solutions or outcomes to this problem instead of reiterating the problem."

Use a white noise track.,
Don’t keep any work-related materials in your room.,
Make sure bedroom walls are pale and simple.,
Keep the room uncluttered.",How to Sleep in Zen Relaxation," In order to do this, you focus on a muscle and contract it for about 5 seconds and then allow it to relax for 10 seconds. While there is no one right sequence of muscles, most either go from head to toe or vice versa., Avoid rehashing the day or going over some problem. This will distract you from your purpose. Slowly let you mind wind down. Don't encourage any ruminative patterns, but consciously let them go.Here are some ways to help you let go of your thoughts:Don't be drawn in to a conversation with ruminative thoughts.
Reassure yourself that the thoughts will go away.
Practice mindfulness.

, Once you've achieved physical and mental relaxation, allow yourself to fall asleep. This means surrendering to your relaxation. In some forms, this means opening oneself up to the divine. In others, it simply means letting yourself go.Part of this is removing distractions. Make sure your phone is on silent or off and that other electronics are removed from around your bed., To maintain zen relaxation within sleep, you'll need some level of awareness. Lucid dreams are a way to do this. Lucid dreams typically mean inducing awareness in your sleep while dreaming. There are different methods to achieving lucid dreams, including telling yourself to dream something in particular, prepping your mind for lucid dreaming by reading about others' experiences, and doing reality checks (or doing some kind of gesture repeatedly throughout the day to show that your awake). The reality check may then show up in your dream and allow you to dream lucidly.It's worth noting that people who meditate and practice mindfulness are more likely to have lucid dreams., This means working on the vividness of your dreams. Part of that is working on remembering your dreams to begin with. With daily meditation and mindfulness practice, you should start remembering your dreams more. Write down the dreams you remember when you wake up. Write down all the details you can remember. With time, this should improve your dream recall.You'll want to practice visualization when awake. This means closing your eyes and picturing different objects. If you visualize an apple, for instance, you'll start with a basic image. Then you'll ask yourself, ""What color is it?"" Notice what your brain does to the image. Does it change from red to a different color? Does the shading become more nuanced? Then work on manipulating the apple. Imagine it being sliced, and reforming, changing shape and color. With time the visualization will become easier and more vivid.

, While having such dreams during lucid dreaming (or regular dreaming), can be quite a powerful experience, it is important to realize that random synapse firings still affect dreams, and that regular life can get mixed up in dreams as well. Instead, focus on experiencing, recalling, and allowing the dream to be, rather than trying to force a meaning on it., This can help to make you more relaxed during the day and more ready to go to sleep at night. Try introducing meditation slowly by doing short stints of meditation. You can use guided meditation, if you’re afraid of setting out on your own. Or you can find a community that practices zen meditation., Zen practice often focuses on the breath. It will help you become more relaxed during your day and before you sleep. Breathing deeply is a natural way to you’re your body if you feel anxious or agitated., This awareness of what is going on in the moment can help reduce stress. If you are fully engaged in your experience as it is happening—paying attention to your breath, the senses, your body’s experience—it can be difficult to worry about anything else. It is important to do this practice without judgment. It may even be a tool you use in combination with the other methods in this article to enhance those experiences., This may take time as the options are many. Select a meditation that suits your going to sleep ritual. If you tend to fall asleep very quickly, you may want to select a shorter track. If you’re an insomniac, you may want a longer one that focuses on muscle or breathing relaxation.Do what feels right. If you are more comfortable with a certain type of voice (smooth or whispery; deeper or higher-pitched), use a meditation that with that type of voice.

, Technical disruptions interrupt pre-sleep meditation and relaxation. They can also interrupt your sleep after your sleep meditation has allowed you to drift off. The light from devices can also disrupt your sleep, so make sure the brightness is turned all the way down., Make sure you’re comfortable. In yoga, sleeping on the left side for about half the night is considered ideal. The rest of the time should be other positions, such as on your back, on your stomach, or on your right side. Doing so promotes full-body health., This can often be uncomfortable for those who haven’t tried meditation before, as you don’t know what to expect, and may not like what you find. If you’re already laying down to sleep, try giving the track a few minutes before giving up on it. You may well be asleep before you change your mind.If you’re worried about what may be on the meditation, try listening to your sleep meditation earlier in the day so you know what to expect. This allows you the freedom to change the meditation before you’re trying to go to sleep.

, There are quite a few options for music that are supposed to help with sleep. Some are called “zen” music, and often include relaxing tones and rhythms.Listening to music can improve sleep quality., A fountain can produce a gentle sound that your mind can focus on as you drift off.Not only is the sound of water a natural way to calm yourself, the sound can also mask more disruptive sounds that would disturb zen relaxation., If you can’t have a fountain in your room, or you simply like other sounds than water, you can download all kinds of white noise apps. Nature sounds such as the ocean or a garden can soothe you back to sleep. Even whale sounds are available to help you sleep. To sleep in zen relaxation, you might need a sound that helps you drift off., Your bedroom should be a place for sleep, not work. If you have a limited space (or live in a studio apartment), try to create a barrier between where you sleep and where you work. This will help your mind associate your room with rest., Bright colors or busy patterns in a bedroom can disrupt sleep. Pale pink or pale blue can be good choices. This will help give you a calming feeling when you enter the room., Clutter can disrupt the good energy in the room, and make the space feel less serene. A simple décor with few disruptive elements is best. Avoid the accumulation of items unnecessary for sleep."

Exhale as you relax the muscle quickly. Pay close attention to the difference you feel between a tense muscle and a relaxed one. Remain relaxed for 15 seconds.
Move on to the next muscle group and repeat. Do this for all muscles in your body.

Listen to some soothing music or nature sounds.,
Watch your favorite movie or TV show.,
Get a pretty coloring book and nice art pencils or markers.,
Read a book or magazine.Reading is a great way to unwind and stop thinking about all the things you did or didn’t get done during the day.,
Get outside if you can.,
Practice your favorite hobby.,
Spend time with your pet(s).Pet therapy is popular for a good reason: bonding with your pet promotes relaxation and happiness.,
Call or spend time with a friend or loved one.",How to Relax After a Long Day2," Buy or download a CD with instrumental music, like classical, or light jazz. Or try a recording of nature sounds. Birds chirping, waves crashing on a beach, a babbling brook, etc. There are many options.Any type of music you enjoy will work, as long as it promotes peaceful feelings and happiness. If rock is your favorite genre, you might try slow ballads or some classic rock over more dissonant, heavy sounds.

, But don’t overdo it! Choose a comedy to get you laughing, which immediately promotes a relaxed attitude and body.Limit your TV and other screen time at night. Don’t watch 2-3 hours before bedtime because the bright light may activate, rather than relax, your brain.
Make it a treat by choosing what to watch carefully. The less often you watch TV, the better it makes you feel when you do it. Set aside 30 minutes or an hour to watch your favorite show at night, or save up time and watch a movie every Thursday evening, for example.

, Adult coloring books are a huge trend right now, and you can easily find one in most craft and office supply stores, shopping centers, or even online. They are more intricate than the coloring books you had as kids, and often printed on nice quality paper. Buy yourself some multicolored sharpies or nice art pencils for less than $20 to really make it a treat.

, It’s also a wonderful way to get ready for bed, since a book doesn’t require screen time. Pick a novel you want to read and set aside 30 minutes before bed to read a chapter, or save up your magazine subscriptions for this time of day.


Listen to an audio book if you prefer. Visualize the action and setting in your head while you sit or lay comfortably.
If you prefer using an e-reader or tablet, try to use it without backlighting, if possible. A simple kindle screen looks just like a page in a book, and many tablets have a setting where you can adjust the lighting to look more like paper than a screen.
Horror books or intense mysteries might not be the best thing to read before bed. Use your own judgment: if it will keep you up thinking about it all night, save this title for a day off and pick something light-hearted instead.

, Especially if you have been working inside all day.Sometimes called “ecotherapy,” spending time in nature helps reset your mental energy so you can be productive again tomorrow.It’s best to get a little exercise if you can, but even sitting outside in a lawn chair or on your porch will help you unwind. Bring a cup of herbal tea with you, and an ottoman to put your feet up.
Get a rocking chair for your porch or deck, if possible. Turn on a small fan if it’s a warm night with no breeze.
Use some citronella candles to keep bugs away in the summertime. Having a fan blowing on you will also help keep flying insects out of your personal space.

, Whatever you love to do, have a short and long task ready to do on any given night to make yourself more likely to engage in something fun after a long or difficult day. If your day has been mostly physical work, choose a mentally-related hobby, and vice versa.Start a new sport by joining a league or taking a class. Martial arts is both fun and helps train your mind to pay attention to the moment. If you like Frisbee, find an Ultimate Frisbee league near you that practices a few times a week.
If you spend most of your day being active, try something like painting or woodworking. Build a model ship, learn to cross stitch, or paint an abstract scene focusing on colors and textures.

, No doubt they missed you all day, so set aside some time to play with your dog or brush your cat.


Make this quality time both of you enjoy. Don’t try to give your dog a bath or clip your kitty’s nails now. That’s a chore, not a fun activity!
Do double duty by taking your dog for a walk. You’ll be spending time together and getting some exercise for both of you!

, If you have family at home, do something special together when you get home, especially if your time together is limited. If you live alone, set up a date or phone date with your BFF or mom or sibling just to check in and share some laughs.


Being in the same room with a family member does not mean you are spending time with them. Give them your attention and don’t stay glued to the TV or your iPad."

Try aromatherapy.,
Write in your journal.",How to Relax After a Long Day3," Meditating for 10-20 minutes a day can help you lower overall stress, and even a brief 5 minute meditation when you feel overwhelmed can help you refocus during a stressful situation or workday.

Feel the air in your body as it moves and release all tension with each exhale. If your mind wonders away, gently bring your attention back to your breath.
If you want to try guided imagery, do the same thing while imagining yourself in a calm, beautiful, or safe place. It could be your granny’s kitchen table, a beach on the Indian Ocean, a hot air balloon ride, or anywhere you want. Picture yourself there by using your senses, like sight, sound, smell, and even touch. The more completely you can imagine it, the easier to feel relaxed.Download a meditation app to your phone, like Headspace, for a free trial. Headspace offers 10 days of 10 minute meditations to teach you how to meditate. It’s amazing what just 10 minutes will do for you! Or try one of The Chopra Center’s meditation apps.

Good ones for letting go of a long day include: “Sometimes things are the way they are for a reason;” “Tomorrow is a new day;” and “At this hour, you cannot do anything to change, so rest instead.”, Try chamomile, lemon grass or lemon balm, or verbena.


Be careful not to have any caffeine or it could disrupt your sleep.
Don’t ingest too much sugar close to bedtime.
Having a small piece of chocolate or another treat is ok, but don’t eat a lot within 3 hours of bedtime or it may disrupt your sleep.

, Lavender, in particular, is a great scent for relaxing before bedtime., There are lots of options for what type of journal you keep, and it’s up to you! Write down your accomplishments for the day to remind yourself of how hard you worked. Or, start a daily gratitude journal. Just write about your day to get it all off your mind so you can relax. Plan for the next day so you aren’t thinking about tomorrow all evening and wasting your free time.


Writing down 3-5 things you are grateful for each day is a great way to keep your mood high and release stress. Read it the next morning if you wake up and feel dread about the day ahead.

Cooperate.,
Ask for clarification in the right way.,
Speak directly and only if required.,
Do not fight the robber or offer resistance.,
Take note of as many details as you can.,
Call the police and lock all doors after the robber leaves.",How to Stay Calm During a Robbery2," During a robbery it is important to demonstrate that you are not a threat or obstacle to the robber. A good way to convey this is to remain calm and cooperate with the robber. Work with the robber's commands to help keep both yourself and everyone else as safe as can be during the robbery. Do not offer to volunteer or actively help the robber. Only do what they ask of you.
Listen carefully to commands and work quickly and effectively to fulfill them.
Inform the robber directly about any steps you need to take and explain why you are doing them.
Ask them permission for any actions like putting your hands in a drawer or your pockets before doing so.

, If you are given a command by the robber and you don't understand what they are asking, you may need to ask for clarification. Doing so can be dangerous as the robber is likely to be highly agitated and nervous. Try asking a question using some of the following techniques to make sure you keep the situation as calm as can be:Keep your question direct and short. Saying something like “I'm sorry. I don't understand.” can be simple enough and still get your intention across.
If you misheard something try rephrasing what you thought you heard as a question. For example “You wanted only 10 dollar bills?”
You should ask for permission before doing anything that might alarm the robber. For example “I must reach under the counter to get the keys. Is this okay?”
Never ask any questions that are not relevant to your own confusion about what the robber was asking.

, Normally during the course of a robbery you should remain as silent as you can. However, there may be a time when the robbery asks you a question that requires a response from you. Speaking honestly and directly can help keep you stay calm in your response.


Long responses during a robbery can increase stress and panic.
Try to frame responses in a positive way, working with the robber and showing compliance.
Always answer honestly.
Never try to change the robbers mind.
For example, if you are asked where money might be located and how to access it, you might reply “In the safe. It's here behind the counter”. Don't go into any more detail about the money or safe unless asked.

, Robbers do not want a fight. Fighting will only get you and possibly other people hurt or killed. Remain calm throughout the robbery and do not try to put and end to it by fighting the robbers or trying to get in their way.Move slowly and calmly. Quick movements may appear threatening to the robber.

, Keeping track of details regarding the robber and the robbery can be of use to police and can also help to keep your mind focused and calm. Pay careful attention to details about both the robber and what the robber did during the crime to help keep you relaxed.Remember what the robber looked liked. Take mental notes of height, weight, clothes, or other distinguishing aspects.
Remember what the robber did. Keep a mental record of everything the robber did and in what order.
Don't stare or make eye contact with the robber. Take quick glances only.
Don't go out of your way to take in the details as this can put you in danger.

, Immediately after the robber leaves lock all doors and windows and contact law enforcement to report your situation. Locking doors and windows will help keep the robber from returning as well as preserve the crime scene for when law enforcement arrives.Work with law enforcement to explain the details of the robbery that you recall.
Talk with others at the crime scene to help keep you calm and recall details about the robbery.
Do not touch anything in the area as police will need to investigate it.
Check the condition of those present once the doors and windows have been secured.

Realize that you're losing your temper with this person.,
Breathe deeply and slowly.,
Count to 10 in your head.,
Be polite and short.,
Find a pillow to punch and punch it a few dozen times.,
Keep a diary to write in.,
Let it go.,
Don't linger on the past.,
Acknowledge the anxiety and tension that comes with being frustrated and annoyed with other people.,
Let go of the need to be in control or to have everything perfect.,
Use mindfulness to remain calm.",How to Keep Calm when You Are Annoyed With Someone," This is important, otherwise you might simply let out your annoyance or feel justified in being irritated.;
, Keep your cool by breathing deeply and slowly, to calm down your nervous system and to buy yourself some thinking space.


Try inhaling for 4 seconds, holding for 2, exhaling for 8, waiting for 2 and repeat. This will help to calm you down.

, Once again, this buys you some time to think about what you'll do and say next.

, Say something neutral to allow you to excuse yourself from the situation so that you can go and calm down away from the source of the irritation. Walk away from the person and the situation with dignity, keeping calm as you leave.


If things come to a head, don't be afraid to be the stronger person and just walk away. It's easier to let the other person calm down a bit and try to talk later, and it will be easier for both of you.

, This can help you to release your annoyance initially. This step is optional, as not everyone finds this sort of physical release useful or warranted.

, This can allow you to scribble down all your concerns, thoughts and solutions. Work it out through writing.

, It's easier to just let things go and move on.


For example if someone said they'd do something for you and they forgot, don't get annoyed. Instead, ask them if they could remember to do it at the next possible moment and send them a text close to that time to remind them to do it. Don't focus on the fact that they forgot, forgive them and move on, it's not worth the hassle for you.

, If someone has done something to bug you or even unknowingly annoys you, don't tell them what they should have done. If you need to say this, just say it's ok for now but in the future could they please do it differently. Keep your calm.


If you're communicating with this person through texting or messaging, then avoid using all capitals and focus on your punctuation. ""Please could you not do that"" is much more polite and calmer than ""DNT DO THT"" this will also work to help calm the other person down if they are reacting like this.

, This is doing you harm, especially in the long run, as the inability to relax and find a place of calm leaves you constantly on edge. For the sake of your own health, tap into your inner calm and rely on it to deal with future annoying situations and people.

, Realize that if you have a need to control or perfect situations or outcomes, then you are probably going to get annoyed a lot. By letting go of this tendency and letting things unfold as they will, you will feel less annoyance when things don't turn out the way you hoped they would.


Snap out of autopilot. When you approach the world with a set of expectations and run yourself according to that instead of being flexible and aware of the moment, it's easy to become annoyed. You're actually not ready for interacting clearly with other people in this situation because you're following a prepared script of how the world ""ought to be"" rather than how it actually is. Teach yourself to be more aware of the world around you and less determined to shape it to your preferences.

, This will help you to put the small things into perspective. It can also help you to accept that people are going to do things that aren't necessarily in agreement with what you'd like done or said. Mindfulness will help you to respond rather than react to such ""annoyances"" or deviations in your preferences. Through mindfulness, you can see what is actually happening and stay non-judgmental. This lets you sort out whether or not there is actually something worth being annoyed about, and often there won't be. Even where there is, by being mindful, you can focus on finding a mutually agreeable solution instead of letting your frustrated feelings take center stage.


Mindfulness takes practice. It's not something you whip out for use once in a while––it's a whole way of being, of thinking and of approaching the world. To assist you, see further How to be mindful and How to exercise mindfulness to be happier.
Mindfulness allows you to access your self- and other-compassion. This is vital for effective treatment of annoyance.

Make it your top priority when you wake, or take your gym bag to work or school. That way, you’ll be more likely to stick to your workout.

, Chronic stress can prompt you to reach for unhealthy foods like fast food or convenience meals that you can eat on the go. But, such empty-calorie foods only make you feel worse. Strive to eat a balanced diet of nutritionally-dense foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats, and lean protein.Make it easier on yourself to eat healthy by prepping your meals over the weekend.

This includes defining for the office staff what would be an “emergency”. Limit the access to your emergency contact information to a trustworthy and experienced co-worker you can trust to buffer you from unneeded contact. When you tell someone you won’t be checking messages, stick to it., Don't allow the phone to intrude on your vacation. Resist the urge to constantly check for updates. If your message says you are checking voicemail once an evening, do just that. Tell people before you leave that you won't be checking it often, so if there is an emergency, have them call the hotel or resort if they can't reach you.

Don't simply fill every hour of your schedule just because you think you should.Also consider making additional preparations to suit any kids on the trip. For example, if you may want to veg out on the beach but children may start to get bored doing this each day. Schedule in some fun kid-friendly activities to keep them engaged, satisfied and out of your hair.

,


No one wants to survive a 14-hour long flight across the globe and then have to show up for work in the next 10-12 hours after the plan lands. Always give yourself ample time to bounce back from your vacation by scheduling in enough time to fully recuperate after your travels and before returning to work.

, If your thoughts keep returning to work, studies, and solving world problems, remind yourself that you're on vacation and that a rested mind is a more productive one upon return.


Resting and fully relaxing will allow you to be more creative, thereby sparking new ways of seeing things, new ways of solving problems and new ways of fixing what isn't working in your life. Don't deny yourself these possibilities.

, Focus on your surroundings and experience everything you can. Remind yourself to slow down enough to listen to the waves, feel the breeze on the beach and breathe in clean ocean air. Wherever you are, take in the physical surroundings., Just as it’s important to release those mental worries, it’s also significant to relieve physical tension. There are lots of great ways to do this, here are just a few: Go for regular swims that involve bobbing around the pool or watering spot. Just enjoy the water. Swimming is great for de-stressing your muscles, and it can really make you feel more like you are on holiday.
Get a massage. Visit the spa for a soothing massage as often as you can. Enjoy them thoroughly.
Do some meditation. If you don't know how, use the vacation to find someone to show you and share this joyous journey together.

, Explore what makes you feel relaxed and rejuvenated. Whatever was stressing you, it is over right now. Savor this moment as one to recall for later. Trust your co-workers to handle things while you are gone, and give yourself permission to do self-care.Practice using a positive self mantra if you find yourself worrying about work. Remind yourself, “I am not working this week and I left work in good hands.”

, Enjoy the warmth on your skin and resist setting an alarm. Before you fall asleep, imagine that you are relaxing from toe to head. Start by letting your toes go limp, then your ankles, legs, hips, torso, arms, chest, neck and finally, your head. You should try to do this as slowly as possible, really focus on releasing every ounce of tension.


Do not worry about making it all the way through the exercise. There is a good chance you will peacefully fall asleep. When you wake up, you should feel relaxed., These are great for de-stressing you, especially chamomile. Tea can be enjoyed warm or in a big glass with ice. Enjoy the taste and smell of the tea.

, Take advantage of the time you have away from work to truly relax on your vacation and cherish this special time with loved ones.

, Ensure that the remaining staff is prepared to take care of anything you usually handle. This means being organized and systematic prior to going on vacation, to ensure that the tasks that need doing will occur without you.Pass on vital files, notes, action items and meetings to a colleague or supervisor. Make sure your team is on the same page as far as who is stepping in to take care of which tasks and which tasks can simply wait for your return.Take special care to inform others who the contact person is while you are gone so they know who to call. Inform this person of what needs doing while you're away and what to do in an emergency--without having to contact you.
Clearly define what you see as being an “emergency” and make sure everyone involved is empowered to act to solve an emergency.
Update your outgoing voicemail message to include the facts about how long you are out of the office and contact information as to who callers can contact if they need someone before your return. Include a disclaimer that messages will not be checked until your return.
Proactively touch bases with any high contact clients to make sure they know you are going to be out and offer any assistance you can prior to leaving.
Put an ""out of office"" notice on your emails. Set an auto-reply to send a simple note back about your vacation in reply to emails. In this message include contact information for those who are covering for you.
Leave tricky business with a competent person. Be wise and choose someone you know can handle the potentially explosive client, the nosy neighbor, or the meddling supervisor. This will help you to relax and you can expect a full report after the vacation.Always create a paper and email trail that shares who is covering what in case something does happen.

, Be mindful of the difference between traveling for fun or business. You will need comfortable clothes for the vacation, fun things to do (e.g. puzzles, books to read, craft items, etc.), tickets, passports, a cozy pillow, and anything else you can use to focus on down time. Travel without that suit bag you always carry for work and focus on light weight bags that travel easy.You do not need your work files or study notes, your deadline projects and anything else that is likely to disturb your chances of relaxation.
Do not bring the office into your vacation rental. If you do have an emergency come up that requires a minimal amount of work, arrange to do the work in a conference room. This can include attending a meeting via Skype. Set aside a short window of time to do the work and stick to that schedule.

, It can be hard to enjoy a vacation if you're going on it with someone who cannot switch off work or studies but keeps focusing on these things instead of the vacation.Make arrangements to take once-in-a-lifetime adventures while vacationing to keep you and your vacation partners occupied. Sometimes the best way to avoid work is to stay busy., While it may not be reasonable to fully disconnect, chances are, any emergency contacts can be made through a single device.Look at the primary use of each of the electronic devices you are thinking about packing. The laptop you use for work does not need to go on vacation. You may want to take a digital camera and even a tablet for uploading pictures. If the item is purely for creative, fun and enjoyable purposes that feed into the vacation theme of relaxing, then maybe... but otherwise, be strict about not taking or using it."

Wear an outfit that makes you feel confident.,
Wear loose clothing.,
Avoid heavy or awkward clothing.,
Designate a meditation outfit.",How to Wear Meditation Clothes1," There is no right or wrong clothing to mediate in. The right outfit varies from person to person. Some people meditate naked in the comfort of their own homes while others wear sweat pants, yoga pants, tank tops, or T-shirts. Wear whatever feels comfortable to you today.If you feel good in your clothing, you will have better meditation.;
, Avoid wearing tight-fitting clothes that may prevent you from breathing comfortably and meditating. Pick something on the loose side, but not so loose that it bothers you or gets in the way. Flowing robes are ideal for meditation.If you feel any tingling, numbness, or like your legs have “gone to sleep” your clothing may be too tight.
Pants with elastic waistbands are ideal. They will be comfortable no matter what position you meditate in.

, It's difficult to meditate in a heavy coat or jacket, so take it off when possible. Jeans, tights, hoodies, and headbands can also be awkward, as they tend to pinch or need frequent adjustment. If you are not able to change your clothes, remove your belt and untuck your shirt.


Your clothes should never be a distraction or a hindrance. They should allow you to focus on your inner self.
Drawstrings and jewelry tend to get in the way as well.

, Once you've found something comfortable, you might want to make it your permanent meditation outfit. Think of your mediation outfit as a uniform. When you put it on, you know it is time to get down to business.A special mediation outfit may also help you get into deeper mediation more quickly.

Don’t worry if you have trouble focusing at first.,
Decide what kind of meditation works best for you.,
Try different types of music each time.,
Try using music at different volumes.,
Seek the advice of a meditation guide.",How to Use Music With Meditation," Make sure the room is a comfortable temperature for you, and that your body is comfortable where you are sitting. Choose a quiet room, so that you can focus on the music you choose.


Keep a good posture, keep your eyes closed, and relax your neck and shoulders while you meditate.;
, Turn off the TV, and make sure you are in a room where there aren’t too many things to divert your attention to. Get pressing things done ahead of time so you won’t feel the need to worry about them while you meditate.


Close the door and let other people in your household know that you are busy, and not to disturb you.Turn off your cell phone or put it on silent and leave it outside of the room, or put it face down so it will not disturb you.

, If you choose to use headphones, it may help to feel like the music is coming from inside of your head, rather than from across the room. This can help your focus.

Noise cancelling headphones can also help cut down distractions and allow you to focus more deeply on the music you choose to listen to while you meditate.

, It doesn’t have to be very long—even 5 minutes will do. Adjust this time as needed, or add to it slowly over time.Meditation is meant as a relaxation tool, so don’t stress yourself out trying to work it into your schedule. This might make it feel like an obligation or a chore rather than a relaxing activity., Trying a few different yoga positions can help get your mind into the right state for meditation, and relax your body. It can also stretch out your muscles and help make you more comfortable.Sukshma yoga is used specifically for relaxation. These moves do not take up much time or space, and can be done anywhere at anytime. Some sukshma yoga moves include rotating your neck slowly one way and then the other, shaking out your hands for a few minutes, and slowly opening and closing your jaw., There are many people who believe you can only use certain types of music with meditation, but that isn’t entirely true. You can really use whatever type of music you want.


Since meditation is meant to promote mindfulness, or the state of being present and mindful of the moment you are in, any kind of music can help. Be mindful and aware of how the music makes you feel, and what you are thinking while you listen to it.If you do have trouble meditating with music that has lyrics or loud instruments, try the more traditional meditation music, like instrumental music, meditation bells, or nature sounds., Finding something to focus on and hone in on when meditating can be a challenge at first. By using music, you are giving yourself something specific to focus on.


Listening to music, all on its own, can be seen as a form of meditation. By focusing on it and being aware of yourself and your thoughts while you listen, you are essentially practicing mindfulness meditation in the process., By thinking about how the music makes you feel, you’re gaining insight into your relationship with that particular song or kind of music, and this is a key in mindfulness.There have been studies that showed that listening to music you enjoy can help your mental state and heal psychological wounds, so using music you love during meditation could be a positive addition to the practice., Breath is an essential aspect of any form of meditation. Make sure you are breathing deeply and slowly, and that you are aware of your breath as it enters and leaves your body.


Taking a few long, slow, deep breaths can help you get started when you meditate. Focus on the part of your body where the breath is most easily felt, be it your nose, your chest, or your belly. Acknowledge the feeling of the breath coming and going from this spot.You can even try using music with a tempo that allows you to align your breaths with the music.

, If you are new to meditation, you might find it difficult to calm your thoughts and focus. This is normal, as meditation takes time and practice.


The important thing with meditation is being able to redirect your thoughts back to your focus once you realize you have moved away from it. Don’t beat yourself up if you have trouble keeping your focus, just work towards redirecting it when you do lose it., This might mean trying multiple forms of mediation to see which one works best. This will also help you decide how to best use music in your practice.


Different types of meditation include sound meditation, where you would repeat a personal mantra to yourself over and over, and mindfulness meditation, which focuses on breath and feeling., Each time you sit down to meditate, try a different kind of music. If soft, soothing music doesn’t work, try something with a more upbeat melody the next time. Or, if instrumental music was unhelpful, try something with lyrics.


You don’t always have to use music traditionally associated with meditation, like nature sounds or chanting. You can use whatever music you are most comfortable listening to, even if that music is heavy metal! If you can relax and focus and gain insight while listening, then you can use it while meditating., Many meditation guides will advise you to keep the volume relatively low, so that it doesn’t become the dominating factor of your session, and can better be used as a background noise.This might take some guessing and testing. Just like you will want to try different kinds of music, you will want to try different volumes as well. Make sure you aren’t listening too loudly as to hurt your ears or become uncomfortable, but not too quietly that you can’t hear it at all.

, There might be classes offered at your school or in your community, or you could find a book that details different meditation methods and how to pursue them.


The internet is a great resource for e-books and podcasts that can help you learn both how to meditate and how to incorporate music into your sessions. There are also podcasts and digital albums that can be used for guided meditation, to listen to while you meditate."

Know that colors vibrate.,
Choose a color based on your purpose.,
Experiment with different colors.",How to Wear Meditation Clothes2," Colors have energy and vibrations that can affect how you feel and act. You can absorb the energy of a color, and color can be used to heal and restore balance. The colors that you wear when you meditate can help or hinder what you are trying to accomplish.Simply imagining a color when you meditate can influence your meditation. The colors that you wear are even more powerful.

, Your goal of your meditation will vary depending on your personal circumstances and needs. Before you meditate, identify what you would like to get out of the session. Then choose an outfit that incorporates the colors that you need.Red is the most powerful color and encourages physical activity, passion, strength, and courage.
Orange encourages change and communication.
Yellow encourages creativity, happiness, and intellect.
Green encourages healing and prosperity.
Blue encourages spiritual connection and peace.
Purple encourages power.
Indigo promotes your intuition and insight.
White encourages protection and virtue.
Pink encourages affection, kindness, and compassion.
Brown encourages you to be grounded and practical.
Black is the absence of color and is often associated with evil.
For example, if you were struggling with depression, you may meditate while wearing yellow. If you are sick, you may meditate while wearing green.

, As you meditate in different colors, take notes about how you felt. Some colors may work better for you than others. If you do not have a variety of colors to wear, you can change the colors of your mediation cushion covers for the same effect.The colors are only suggestions. Use your personal judgement to decide what is best for you.

Be modest.,
Layer your clothing.,
Check the rules.",How to Wear Meditation Clothes3," If you are meditating in a class or group environment, your clothing should be on the modest side. Avoid any low cut tops or tops with loose necklines or collars. Make sure your top is long enough to cover your torso no matter what position you are in.In a group setting, your clothing should not be a distraction to the other people that you are around either.

, If you layer your clothing, you will can be comfortable in any environment. You may be cold at the beginning of your mediation but warm up as you go along. You may be in a studio or gym that blasts the air conditioning. Keep a light jacket, hoodie, or shawl with you. If you have to be barefoot, bring some socks in case your feet get cold.Cotton and silk are breathable fabrics that are good for layering.

, Many people meditate at religious temples or meditation centers. These places often have dress codes that you must follow. Call the location or check their website before you go meditate. You do not want to be turned away because your outfit is not appropriate.


Common limitations include no shorts, tank tops, tight fitting clothes, or shoes. You may also have to wear clothes that cover your knees.

Choose a quiet space.,
Sit comfortably.,
Keep a solid posture.,
Soften your gaze or close your eyes.,
Relax your hands.",How to Start Meditating1," Choose a space to meditate in that is quiet and free from distraction. The quieter and cleaner the space the less likely you will be distracted by other objects, sounds, or people. Quiet spaces can sometimes be hard to come by, especially if both your home and work are busy places. If this is the case, you may have to schedule your meditation at a time when a space is quieter than usual, like early in the morning or late in the evening.


You may want to start meditating in a place where you can adjust the lighting to be less distracting, especially if it’s bright.
Try meditating in your bedroom first thing in the morning or just before bed.;
, There are many options for seated postures in meditation. However, if you are just starting out, it is best to find a way to sit that is comfortable. Don’t worry about how your legs are crossed or in which direction your toes are pointed. Find a comfortable seat, which can even be a small stool or chair, and sit comfortably. If you are sitting on the floor, a mat, or a meditation cushion, try gently crossing your legs.There are five main sitting postures for seated meditation: full lotus, half lotus (crossed-legs), kneeling, chair sitting, and lying.Seated postures can also affect your flexibility. You may find that you need to change the way you sit over time.
Over time, you may find that you will need a meditation cushion to properly support your posture. Meditation cushions are relatively cheap and can be purchased through online vendors., Keeping an upright and solid posture will help you maintain attention and increase circulation. This may take some strength at first, but over time you core will adjust and be able to support you for longer amounts of time. A general rule for meditation posture is to stay straight and stay relaxed. Try to imagine that the top of your head is connected to a string and that the rest of your spine is hanging with gravity.If you notice that you begin to slouch or that sitting upright becomes uncomfortable, take a different posture or take a rest.

, Different styles of meditation call for different eye positions. However, it’s best to try to find what is most comfortable when you are starting out. Closed eye meditation can be advanced in some traditions and novice in others. If you decide to keep your eyes open, soften your gaze so that your vision almost becomes blurry. Try to focus on a specific point, preferably on the floor so that your gaze is lowered.Feel free to try both options during the same meditation session. If you feel as though keeping your eyes open is too distracting, close them for a minute or so.

, Hand positions can vary depending on which tradition you are meditating within. Instead of focusing on specific hand positions, simply rest the palms of your hands gently on your knees. Keeping your hands relaxed will in turn help relax your arms, shoulders, and neck. If you find that you are stretching your arms to place your hands on your knees, simply drag your hands back toward your body until you find a comfortable position.


Other hand positions include touching your thumb to your index finger, or touching your thumb to your ring finger.

Meditate while sitting in a chair.,
Sit with your back against a wall.,
Sit with support under your knees.",How to Sit During Meditation1," This is perhaps the simplest meditation pose, as it doesn’t involve any bodily stretching or contortion. Find a chair with a straight back, and sit forward in the seat, with the balls of your feet resting firmly on the floor.Sitting in a chair is a good method to strengthen your back muscles, which will prepare you for more difficult unsupported positions.
If you find that it’s strenuous on your back to sit up straight without assistance, place a few pillows between your back and the back of the chair.;
, The wall will support your back and help you maintain a steady posture. You can sit with your legs crossed beneath you or extended out in front of you. Use whichever pose is more comfortable.If you don’t have a conveniently located wall, try sitting with your back against a heavy piece of furniture, such as a large bookcase.
If it’s uncomfortable to sit directly on the ground, use a pillow or folded blanket.

, If sitting in a chair feels too stiff, try kneeling directly on the floor, but with support propped under your knees. In this position, you’re still technically sitting (weight on your buttocks), but the knee support will make the pose easier to hold.To achieve the position, kneel directly on the floor. Then tuck a folded blanket or pillow behind your knees, and then lower your body into a seated position on the folded support.
Consider buying a meditation bench, This is a small wooden bench that allows you to kneel on the floor, then sit back and rest your buttocks on the padded seat of the bench."

Come back slowly.",How to Relax With the Sun Meditation," Keep the tension, stop all thoughts and breathe into the legs. Then we relax. Stretch the muscles of the arms and hands. Breathe into the arms and hands and relax. Tense the muscles of the head and face. Breathe into the face and relax. Tense the muscles of the whole body. Breathe into the whole body and relax.;
, Our mind calms. Focus on the chest, breathe into the chest and count the numbers 1 to 20 in the chest. Breathe in the belly, and count there the numbers 1 to 20. Focus on the legs and feet, and count there the numbers 1 to 20. Visualize under the soles a large ball and count the numbers from 1 to 20 in the ball.

, She sends her rays down on us. We feel her light and warmth on our skin. It is as if we are on holiday in the sun. We enjoy the sunlight. We wrap our whole body with light. We take a golden ray of sun and let the sunlight everywhere circle around us. Think the mantra ""Light."" Let the sunlight flow into us and fill us with light. We think the mantra ""Light.""

, Envelop him with light and let the light flow into him. Think many times the word ""Light"". After that we send light all over the world. We wrap the whole world with light, fill it with light and think often ""Light.""

, Stop all other thoughts. Feel calmness, serenity and peace in us. Stop a minute every thought and move gently our feet. We focus on our feet and move on, until our mind comes completely to rest. We relax. We lie a few minutes relaxed just there. We are in harmony with ourselves, our life and our world.

, Move your feet and hands. Stretch and move yourselves. Sit up and are back. Life can come. We have the sun within us.

Deal with toxic people.Toxic relationships can be a powerful obstacle to having peace of mind in your life.",How to Have Peace of Mind," Intentional breathing is a simple activity, but it's one of the most powerful ways to create peace of mind. Emotions and breathing are closely connected. If you slow your breath and learn to breathe evenly and fully, your emotions will calm down as well. Breathing practices have been shown to reduce cortisol, the stress hormone. They also activate the ""rest and digest"" part of the nervous system, known as the parasympathetic nervous system.Here are steps you can take:Find a comfortable place to sit.
Put one hand on your belly and one on your chest.
Breathe in deeply from your belly, so that your stomach extends out but your chest stays in place.
Hold this breath for a couple seconds and then breathe out.
Repeat this sequence until you find a steady rhythm. Try to do this practice for 10 minutes every day.;
, Regular exercise is one of the best things you can do for your body and mind. You should do 30-60 minutes of aerobic exercise (walking, running, bicycling, swimming, etc) 3-5 times per week for good results. Here are some of the things exercise does:Lifts your mood by flooding your brain with endorphins and serotonin, which are ""happy chemicals"" in the brain.Boosts your energy and reduces fatigue.Improves sleep, even chronic insomnia.Reduces your risk for diseases such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes., Sunlight produces Vitamin D in your body, which also increases your serotonin levels. You can't get the same effect from indoor lighting, so try to spend time outside when you can.Here are some activities you can do:


Play sports.
Go for a swim.
Pack a picnic.

, One of the best ways to experience peace of mind and happiness is to get into a flow state. A flow state is where you are completely involved in an activity without overthinking things. You enter flow states when you are doing things you love and when you are being challenged in a way that's suitable to your abilities.Do what you love to do. This could be anything from playing darts on the weekend to landing your dream job as an accountant.

, Generosity actually causes us to be happier and increases peace of mind.Giving away money can decrease the stress hormone cortisol. It can also extend how long you live, and it can even promote mental health. People who are more generous are less likely to be depressed.How you want to be generous is up to you, but here are a few suggestions:


Volunteer at a soup kitchen or another community service organization.
Donate to your favorite charity.
Offer to help friends and family members with finances, home development, or babysitting.

, Gratefulness decreases stress and increases things like optimism and life satisfaction. You don't even need to have a lot to be grateful; there's always something you can be grateful for. Here are steps you can take to be more grateful:


Keep a gratitude journal. People who have a gratitude journal feel better about their lives as a whole. Each day, write down what you're thankful for.
See the positive side to challenges. For example, if you have a noisy neighbor, this can improve your patience and ability to deal with irritation.

, People generally prefer being with others to being alone. Also, connecting with other people gives us an endless stream of peace and happiness. Many sources of ""quick fix"" happiness or peace of mind tend to go away the more we engage in the activity, but spending time with people we are close to seems to be an exception.For example, if you identify with a particular religion, find a good church, temple, mosque, or synagogue to attend.
For more examples, join a sports team or a reading group.

, Creative arts can be a powerful source of happiness and peace of mind.Different ways to express yourself artistically can help you feel better about your life. Here are a few suggestions for things to do:


Draw, color, or paint. You don't have to be amazing; you'll get the benefits of catharsis and engaging your imagination either way.
Dance. Join a dance class or just make a habit out of dancing to music in your home.
Play an instrument. Guitar, piano, and other instruments are a great way to express yourself through music.

, If something is preventing you from achieving peace of mind, it's a good idea to figure out what it is. That way, you can make a game plan for overcoming these obstacles and reaching a peaceful state. Try making a list of things in your life that you're unhappy with. Writing them down is a good way to brainstorm more effectively.

, Is there an event in your past that still haunts you? Maybe you made a mistake that derailed your career or didn't tell someone you loved them? Try to make peace with your past in order to exorcise those old ghosts that may still be haunting you. Peace in the present moment can sometimes be blocked by a past that hasn't been dealt with.Forgive yourself if appropriate. You probably didn't have the same knowledge that you do now.Let go of your anger. Write about your inner rage privately. No need to hold back or censor yourself because no one will see these thoughts. It’s important to not keep your angry feelings bottled up inside and let the negativity fester.Accept what has happened. Playing events over and over in your mind only continues the cycle of hurt feelings. Acceptance and moving forward helps to begin the healing process so you can focus on your future. , If your relationships with parents or loved ones are strained, repair these connections so that you can more fully accept yourself and your life. Sometimes the best way to create peace of mind is to fix the current issues that make it difficult. Close relationships are one of the most important sources of happiness and peace of mind, so it's worth it to try and iron these things out.Seek couples counseling if you feel like your marriage or relationship is falling apart.
Ask for forgiveness if you've hurt someone. Be sure to accept responsibility for your actions.
Write a letter to the person expressing your desire to reconnect.
Social isolation is a huge source of discontentment in life. Avoid isolating yourself, so that you can have the social connections necessary for true peace of mind. Participating in a shared activity is a great way to connect with others. You could volunteer, take a class, join a book club, or exercise in a group setting., It's easy to hold grudges, but forgiving people who have hurt us is really important for mental health and better relationships. If you want peace of mind, you'll need to let go of any bitterness you have toward people from your past. You don't actually need to reconcile with these people if you don't want to; forgiveness is something that happens inside of you rather than between you and another person.When you forgive, you are allowing yourself to heal because you are letting go of your grievances and negative judgements.Holding onto grudges can negatively affect you by bringing anger and bitterness into every new situation, not being able to enjoy the present, losing connection with others, feeling like your life lacks meaning, and becoming depressed or anxious.A good exercise is to write down the names of people you're angry at and the reasons you're angry. You can then say ""I forgive you"" to each of the people. Lack of forgiveness can hurt you more than the other people, so do this for your own sake.

, Buying things is not a good method for creating peace of mind. You may feel a surge of happiness when you first get a new belonging, but this will wear off more quickly than other sources of happiness such as strong relationships.Materialism increases competitiveness, and people who have more tend to have higher rates of depression and marital dissatisfaction.If you want peace of mind, avoid the trap of buying things to feel good.

, You may need to make significant changes in your life in order to feel at peace. For instance, living in a bad neighborhood can negatively affect your mind, causing things like depression.If you feel really stressed by life circumstances such as your current job or where you live, it's recommended that you take steps to changing your surroundings. A job that makes you miserable or an unsafe neighborhood may seem tolerable, but they can have strong effects on your mental health and prevent you from having peace of mind. Here are some tips to help you make lasting changes:Make plans that you will stand by. Make sure when you're in the planning process that it's what you really want. For instance, if you want to move to a new place, make sure it's somewhere that you'd enjoy living in terms of culture, food, political affiliation, etc.
Start with small, reasonable steps. Avoid planning to move across the country this coming weekend. If you do want to move, start small by researching housing options, school options, and more.
Involve the other people in your life. Don't do it all on your own. Enlist help from friends and family members. If you want to move, ask what they think and see if they will help you pack up.

, These people may drain your emotions and never give anything back. They may take advantage of you. It may feel like everything is about them in the relationship. You may feel uncomfortable being yourself around them. Here are some tips for how to deal with these kinds of toxic relationships:


Avoid being in denial. It's easy to make excuses for the people we enjoy being around, but ask yourself how you feel after you've spent time with them. Ask yourself if you actually want to spend time with them or if it feels like you have to. Ask yourself if you expect something from them that you never get.
Identify what you get out of the relationship. Even toxic relationships have some kind of draw, or you wouldn't be in them. Maybe the person makes you feel comfortable, even if they hurt you. Maybe they buy you things to make up for their negative behavior.
Find alternative sources. The likelihood is that you can find other ways to fill these wants and needs for yourself. You don't need to stick around in a friendship or romantic relationship that's toxic; you can find the same perks elsewhere without all the baggage. Try meeting new people.

Set a timer.,
Get comfortable.,
Focus on your breath.,
Soften your attention.",How to Start Meditating2," Set a timer for the amount of time you are going to sit and meditate. This can be however long or short you have. If you only have one minute to meditate, then set your timer for one minute.Try using a soothing alarm to bring you gently back into your day. There are many meditation timers that can be downloaded on mobile devices, like Insight Timer., Relax and get comfortable. Find your seat, adjust your posture, and set your gaze. There is no reason to rush your initial preparation for meditation. Take your time and find points where your body and mind can relax.Consider your initial seating with how long you will be sitting. If you haven’t sat in full lotus before, then you might not want to try it for 20 minutes your first time.

, Focusing on your breath will help you ease into meditation and loosen your attention. The more fixed on your breath you are, the easier it will be to clear your mind and let go of any thoughts.It might help to count your breaths when you first begin meditating.

, Softening your attention is another way of saying that you need to clear your mind and let go of your daily thoughts. Instead of focusing on what you need to do after you finish meditating, or what just happened right before you sat down, clear your head and be present in the space you are currently in. Let your attention drift from everything but the present moment!However, keep in mind that “ordinary” thoughts are part of the meditative experience. You will come back to schedules, chores, lists, and stories. Don’t get frustrated or hung up on them. Instead, focus on your breath when your mind inevitably wanders. Return to your breath each time this happens and begin to let these thoughts go."

Think about what you would like to receive from meditation.,
Make a consistent schedule.,
Start small.",How to Start Meditating3," There are many great benefits to meditation, from improved memory to reduced anxiety. Spending time thinking about why you would like to meditate and what you would like to gain from meditation will help keep you focused and determined. No reason is too small or insignificant to start meditating. Whatever your reason or intention is, stick to it and stay committed., Meditation, especially for those who are beginners or have not meditated for some time, can be difficult. Many of the effects of meditation only come after significant time and work is spent meditating. The more frequently and consistently you can meditate the better and more developed your results will be. Try to schedule at least some time each day to sit and meditate, even if it is only for two minutes.A consistent schedule does not mean a demanding schedule. In other words, don’t get caught up in how you are meditating, just do!Try committing to meditating first thing in the morning, every morning, no matter how long you can meditate for.

, It can be difficult, and occasionally frustrating, to start meditating. It takes time to relax and to clear your mind. Instead of giving yourself difficult tasks up front, like sitting for 30 minutes straight, try starting small to ease into your practice. After all, it is called a practice for a reason, and it takes time to improve!Start by sitting for only a few minutes, like 2 or 3, when you first meditate. Build up minute by minute as you feel you are able. If you increase your time too quickly, don’t worry! Just reduce your meditation by a few minutes the next time you sit.
Remember, meditation, even though it can be hard work, is meant to be relaxing! Don’t insist and don’t resist!

Begin with the Burmese position.,
Try the Quarter Lotus position.,
Move into the Half Lotus Position.,
Meditate in the Full Lotus position once you’re comfortable.,
Lay down to meditate.",How to Sit During Meditation2," The Burmese position is considered to be the easiest of all unsupported, seated positions, and is great for beginners. To achieve this position, sit flat on the floor, and bend your knees so that your feet are both in front of you. Sit so that the heel of your left foot is touching the top of your right foot (or ankle), but don’t actually cross your legs.The Burmese position places little strain on your legs, knees, and feet.

, This is a relatively simple cross-legged pose. To get into the Quarter Lotus, cross your legs in front of you, by keeping your left foot on the floor below your right thigh, and cross your right foot over to rest on your left calf.If you struggle to achieve this pose initially, try sitting on a small pillow. This will elevate your body and make it easier to fold your legs.

, As the name suggests, the Half Lotus is similar to the Quarter Lotus pose. Move your body into a Quarter Lotus pose, but cross your right foot so that it rests on top of your left thigh (instead of your left calf).If this pose becomes difficult to hold, move back into the Quarter Lotus.

, To achieve the Full Lotus, begin by sitting in the Half Lotus position so that your right foot is resting on top of your left thigh. Then bring your left foot up over your right leg, and rest your left foot on top of your right thigh.The Full Lotus is the most symmetrical and stable meditation pose.For beginners, this pose can be uncomfortable, as you have to put both feet on top of the other leg’s thigh. Never force your body into this pose, as you can hurt your knees.

, Although this is an uncommon position, it’s fine to recline flat on your back in order to mediate.As long as you can breathe properly, you feel comfortable, and your spine is straight, feel free to practice meditation on your back.


If you find it uncomfortable to lay directly on the floor, put down a blanket.
Avoid becoming too comfortable while you’re meditating in a reclining pose. You don’t want to fall asleep.

Wear comfortable clothing.,
Find a time to meditate.,
Meditate in a peaceful place.",How to Sit During Meditation3," When you’re meditating, you’ll want to wear something that lets you move and stretch.Comfortable clothing should be loose, made of a soft material, and allow you to move your body around freely without being restrained.


Avoid wearing jeans.
Yoga pants are a good option, especially when combined with a spandex or acrylic top.
Gym shorts or athletic shorts and a cotton t-shirt are a fine option.

, Set a specific time aside for your meditation (at least 30 minutes), or take advantage of an opening during your schedule. This should be a time when you do not have any meetings or any work left. You may choose to meditate:


During an early morning or late evening, when people around you are still asleep or going to bed.
On a lunch break during your workday.

, The space you meditate in should be well lit (preferably with natural light) and ventilated. Choose a place where you will not be distracted by things including:


Children (yours or other people’s).
Pets or other animals.
Noises from traffic or machinery.
Your cell phone or computer.

Understand the benefits of raising your frequency.,
Focus on your breathing.,

Keep a journal.",How to Raise Your Vibration," The idea of frequency, or vibrations, revolves around the concept of energy. All matter in the universe is comprised of energy that vibrates at different frequencies at the quantum level. Raising your personal vibration is a tool for using the power of positive thinking to influence your life for the better.


Frequency harkens back to centuries of different cultural beliefs regarding energy. The Chinese have used Tai Chi for thousands of years as a means of healing through energy, Kundalini energy has long been practiced in India, and Japanese Reiki healers have been at work with energy fields for countless generations.;
, Essentially, the theory of raising your vibrations grew from the discovery of subatomic particles and their behavior. Electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom, and sometimes transfer from one nucleus to another. When that shift occurs, energy is released. Thus, the relationship between energy and matter exists.Those who subscribe to personal vibration as a means of changing the physical world believe a similar concept is at work when humans release energy at different frequencies.
It's important to remember that personal frequency is only a theory, and doesn't have the support of much of the scientific community. However, following these steps and understanding the basis of the theory can still help change your life.

, This is also known as the Scale of Consciousness. It stretches from 1 to 1,000 and was designed by Dr. David Dawkins in 2002, based on principles of muscle testing and kinesiology. Where you fall on the scale is a reflection of how the energy you give off, your frequency, manifests in your life and what sort of circumstances and events your energy attracts.


A high score corresponds to a vibrant, thriving energy, while a low score reflects a low frequency output.
The average rating on the scale for humanity is about 207.
Although the average is somewhat low, a single person operating at a high frequency can lift the vibrations of those he or she encounters dramatically.

, The best way to bring positive results into your life, based on the theory of frequency and vibrations, is to raise your frequency by concentrating on positive ideas like love, compassion, and happiness. On the contrary, feelings of anger, distrust, guilt, and shame lower one’s frequency.


To achieve higher frequency and avoid lower frequency in life, it’s important to remember to both think and act in ways that directly affect your personal vibration.

, Those who believe in the power of raising their personal frequency set out with the goal of greater quality of life. The idea is that emitting high frequency attracts high frequency, and therefore raising your vibrations will attract love, wealth, joy, and spiritual enlightenment. It is similar to the Law of Attraction, the idea that like goes with like, that staying positive will help you recognize positives in your life., This is a simple way to clear your mind of the unimportant and negative thoughts that impact your frequency. By taking a few conscious breaths, and thinking about the simplicity of breathing and what truly matters in life, you’ll gain perspective that helps align you with a positive mentality.


Deep breaths lead to clarity and stillness, which have positive effects on vibration., Chances are, if you’re reading this article on a computer or smartphone, you aren’t starving or homeless. Take stock of the wonderful aspects of your life and be grateful for them. Appreciate the little things in life, from a pretty flower to a healthy relative.


Keeping the positive aspects of life at the forefront of your mind helps keep the daily stressors and negativity out of the picture. You’ll be surprised by how much you have to be thankful for when you slow down to look.

, Cursing and insults are obviously forms of anger and hate, which correspond with low frequency. Avoid these and actively replace them with positive alternatives, like compliments. The shift in your behavior and mindset will take time, but will pay dividends in the long run.


Negativity in language comes from other sources, too. Don’t let a defeatist attitude cloud your positive energy. Instead of saying “I can’t,” say, “I’ll try harder next time.” Finding little ways to shift negativity into positive energy will raise your vibration and help bring your goals in life closer to reality.

, This is real life, and there will be times where hardships befall you and depressing events occur. It’s normal to feel down. Your vibration will lower during these times. The key is to bounce back and recover. A great way to do this is through showing compassion and donating your time and energy to charity. Helping others less fortunate will help you feel better about yourself, remind you of all the positives in life, and act as a catalyst for raising your frequency.This step is especially helpful when the dark times come, as you’ll be able to rely on those close to you to recognize your pain and exercise compassion towards you to help. Remember, the people close to you are a reflection of your own frequency.

, Harboring negativity in the form of a grudge or feelings of guilt will cloud your mind from happier thoughts. Let go of the negative energy by forgiving others and forgiving yourself. Understand that nobody is perfect and that when you’re upset, they are likely upset as well. Be open and forward with your emotions and find a way to live in harmony with the people around you.


Laughter is an incredible tool for forgiveness and letting go of negative energy. Try to take a long-term perspective on your current problems. Think about how your old problems seem small and how you laugh about them now. You’ll laugh about today’s problems tomorrow.

, To keep your personal frequency at the high end of the scale you need to consider how your body and mind work in tandem. Your diet directly effects your mood. A lack of physical exercise will negate the positives of better thinking. Don’t ignore the physical aspects of your self and focus too hard to the mental. You can’t thrive without both.


Cut out fast foods, sodas, high sodium products, and sugars. Instead, concentrate on eating fresh fruits and vegetables and lean proteins. You may even consider becoming vegetarian or vegan to further enhance the spiritual connection between your body and nature.
Always read food labels and check for red flags like preservatives, trans fats, and hydrogenated oils.
Daily exercise, even something as simple as a short jog or an evening walk, will connect you to nature and keep your body active. Both of these will increase your vibrations., Remember, like attracts like. Surrounding yourself with the right friends and eliminating relationships with low frequency people will contribute immensely to your overall wellbeing by raising your vibrations. Being your true self will attract others with the same values and frequency.Negative people criticize and bring down your frequency with their low energy. Cut these relationships out of your life. You don’t have to “break up” with a friend, but gradually putting less effort into maintaining the relationship will ease the transition and lead to more opportunities for high frequency people to fill the void.

, Meditating helps clear the mind of troublesome thoughts and increases awareness of the self. This doesn’t need to be an intense practice, but finding a few quiet minutes to focus on your breathing, close your eyes, and slow down your life can have a major impact on increasing your personal frequency and lead to continuous, sustainable positive energy., Writing down the positive experiences you had each day will help commit them to your memory and keep them at the forefront of your consciousness. It’s a great habit to help you remember what’s important and all the aspects of your life you should be grateful for.


Try to end each day by making a list of the positive thoughts and actions you had that day.
Track the compliments you gave and received, as well as the moments you were able to forgive, show compassion, and laugh.

Take twelve minutes in the morning.,
Participate in acts that encourage meditation.,
Take a walk in nature.,
Grow a green thumb.,
Commute quietly.",How to Find Peace1," Mornings are often full of the activities of getting ready for the day. Since you just woke up it might not occur to you to take twelve minutes to relax your mind before you start your day. Science proves that it takes approximately twelve minutes of calm to lower your cortisol, “the stress hormone” in the morning when it is at a high level. Cortisol impacts the body’s ability to maintain homeostasis.
Instead of turning on the computer or phone to check mail or messages, take a cup of tea outside and clear your mind as the sun comes up.;
, When you think of meditation, you might imagine sitting on a pillow, legs crossed, eyes closed. While this is one way to meditate, the truth is you can meditate at any time and, in fact, certain types of activity can actually encourage you to enter a meditative or mindful state. Try doing something slightly repetitive that doesn't demand too much brain power. This could be a chore, such as washing dishes, chopping vegetables, or sweeping the floor, or it could be an activity like knitting, coloring, or throwing clay on a pottery wheel. Find a quiet, distraction-free place to work (turn off the television, etc.) and simply allow yourself to focus on your senses as you work.For instance, if you're washing the dishes, notice how the water feels on your skin and the sponge feels in your hand. Listen to the splash of the water and smell the scent of the soap. Don't judge, label, or think too hard about what you're doing. Just allow yourself to fully experience the moment.
If you find you are distracted by a nagging thought, try writing it down and going back to your activity.

, The quietness of nature is a simple way to find immediately silence. The background noise of the wind blowing, animals bustling about, and your phone turned off, helps the mind to relax on nothingness. If you decide to take a walk in the woods, leave the cell phone, iPod, or tablet at home. These noisy devices can become active at any moment disrupting the peace and quiet.
Or, if you live in the city, hiking in open spaces, strolling through the park, or even watching nature scenes on television has proven to bring about a peaceful environment.

, Besides the production of healthy food, gardening provides an exercise that has many benefits to finding peace. First, gardening puts you outside close to nature and, second, it is mostly a quiet, solo activity. Planting fruits and vegetables will help bring down the stress level. Fresh air and physical exertion that is a part of gardening has shown to reduce stress, release aggression, and reduce weight while, at the same time, provide pride in your production.

, Travel in your car with the music turned off and, instead, reflect on the day’s events to revive a tired spirit and restore peace. Take a break from cell phones, video games, computers, and other electronic devices while driving to or from work to regain some peace in your life. Instead of turning the radio off, play specially made music that focuses on meditation. This type of music usually drowns out the hubbub of the commute and helps reduce stress and bring peace.
Use your commute as an opportunity to bring awareness of your thoughts and feelings without judgment. This mindful exercise will help reduce the negative emotions of a long commute or the impatience of being stuck in traffic.
While commuting, find an enjoyable activity to pass the time. You can use your daily commute a period of peace between other obligations. If you drive, try listening to meditation or classical music. If you take public transportation, read a book or grab a quick nap.

Accept what you cannot change.,
Control your thoughts.,
Release the need to be perfect.,
Avoid spending time with angry or stressful people.,
Practice mindfulness and meditation.",How to Find Your Inner Peace1," The only person that you can change is yourself. You cannot change anyone else’s words, feelings, opinions, or actions. However, that does not mean that this will not affect your life. If someone else’s actions are affecting your life negatively, consider the things you can change and accept the things that you cannot change.For example, if a co-worker always has a negative attitude and brings down your whole office’s morale, you must consider the things that you can change. You could find another job, ask to move departments, or simply chose to meet your co-worker’s negativity with love and kindness.;
, Try to think about positive outcomes to any situation. It is much easier to immediately think about all of the things that could go wrong instead of thinking about all of the things that could go right. Try to match your thoughts to the kind of person that you want to be.After a job interview you may think, “I completely failed that interview.” Instead of thinking of all the things that went wrong during the interview, consider the positive things. You made it through the first phase of the application process and secured an interview. You got the chance to practice your interview skills. The more practice you get, the better you’ll be.

, We live in a society where so many people strive for perfection. Recognize that nothing and nobody is perfect. Finding your inner peace will require you to release the need to be perfect. Realize that there is no perfect career, no perfect relationship, and no perfect body or life. The only person you need to please is yourself. Not others. Be your normal human authentic self and stop striving to be someone you're not. In the process you may empower others to follow your lead and do the same., Spending your time with angry people will in turn make you an angrier person. Living with so much anger can lead to turmoil in all aspects of your life. Surround yourself with positive and uplifting people.Choose to spend your time with friends that treat their spouses and children with kindness and respect instead of friends that always fight and argue with their family members.

, Take some time each day to stop thinking about your life and think about nothing. Clear your mind for a few moments each day to help reach your inner peace. This can be done formally and informally throughout your day. You can spend 30 minutes each morning practicing meditation or spend two or three minutes several times throughout the day to focus on nothing but breathing.Keep in mind that mindfulness doesn’t mean we have to eliminate every thought that flows through our minds. All mindfulness means is that we are living in the moment. As your thoughts come through, acknowledge them, and just let them flow out by refocusing on something in your present moment. Remember that you cannot change anything that has happened in your past (so let it go), and you cannot truly know what will happen in the future. The only thing you can affect is the moment you are in right now.
If meditation is difficult for you, consider a guided meditation or a meditation class.
Even if you are busy, find time each day to practice meditation or mindfulness. It can be done in the shower, while brushing your teeth, or on your commute to work."

Start in a relaxing environment.,
Focus on your breath.,
Focus on your suffering.,
Acknowledge your feelings.,
Visualize your suffering leaving you.",How to Try Compassion Meditation3," Begin meditating in a quiet, calm, relaxing environment. This may be quiet room in your home or an undisturbed area outside. Get into a relaxed position where you are comfortable. Sit on the floor or bed or lie flat.Make sure you are undisturbed during this time. Get rid of all electronic devices.

, As you begin, focus on your breathing. Inhale slowly through your nose. Your abdomen should expand while you inhale. Exhale slowly, letting all the air leave your body until your belly is flat. This should take around two to three seconds.Continue breathing in this way for a few minutes.
Pay attention to each breath as you breathe in and out. Focus on the moment and be aware of your breathing and body.

, Compassion meditation doesn’t just extend to others. You can also practice self-meditation. As you breathe, think of your own suffering. What conflicts or sufferings have you experienced?Think of a time when you experienced loss, faced a conflict, were injured, or were physically ill.

, As you visualize and name your suffering, pay attention to how this makes you feel. How does your heart and soul feel? Do you feel happy and open? Or do you feel an ache or other unpleasant sensation?Acknowledge and name your feelings. These may be positive or negative feelings.

, As you breathe, focus on letting go of your suffering. Imagine that your pain and suffering is connected to a light, balloon, cloud, or bubble. Think about yourself and your feelings and that the light is helping you feel better or that the balloon is filling with the negative feelings.As you exhale, feel each negative thought lessen and drift away.
Tell yourself, “I am not free from this pain” or “I will now have peace and happiness.”

Turn off cell phone notifications.,
Complete unfinished tasks.,
Remove clutter.,
Unplug the television.",How to Find Peace2," Cell phones are easily the greatest distraction in modern society. Research indicates that, on average, people check their cell phones 150 times every day, or every six minutes in a 16 hour day. This cacophony does not promote a peaceful environment. Simply turn off all nonessential notifications – facebook, twitter, game updates, and email – as your default setting.
Make a few scheduled times throughout the day to check all your notifications.

, Work on your time-management skills. It is not uncommon to have several unfinished projects lined up around the house or work. The list may seem unending — household chores, unanswered mail, balancing the checkbook, hungry pets — but many of these projects can be completed in rather short time if you focus on completing them immediately. Adopt a “one-minute rule” mentality as most of unfinished chores can be completed in less than two minutes. By completing these projects as quickly as possible, it will remove many of the small, irritable distractions you deal with on a daily basis.
Keep a short to-do list to keep your day organized and efficient. By writing your tasks down on a piece of paper, you can let that thought leave your mind.

, An unclean environment is not pleasant to anybody’s eyes and a large amount of clutter lying around causes stress. Eyes are very attentive and subtly pick up many details of the surrounding area. Clutter does not allow you to focus your thoughts or attention because of all the visual distractions. Clean your desk, walls, and counters in your home and office of all unnecessary possessions so that you are not easily distracted.
The same goes for digital clutter. Dozens of desktop icons, opened programs, games, or instant messaging all compete for attention. Removing these items will help your focus.

, Or, cancel your cable or satellite subscription. There are fewer time consuming distractions than the television. Indeed, the average person watches between 37-40 hours of television each week. Cable or satellite television now offers nearly two hundred channels. Think about the amount of time you waste simply surfing through all of these stations and end up watching nothing.
If peace in the house is not a strong motivator, think about cost. The average cable package is now more than $100 per month, or $1,200 per year.

Focus on breathing.,
Rest your eyes.,
Relax while you sit in a chair.,
Kneel or use a pillow.,
Sit cross-legged.",How to Find Peace3," Breathing is so natural that we rarely take time to ever think about paying attention to its healthy benefits. Taking short, three minute breaks a few times every day to stop what you are doing and inhale and exhale deeply can help clarify your thoughts, calm you down, and make you more productive. Make sure you find a quiet space so that you can concentrate on breathing as the air circulates throughout your entire body. Start by deliberately preparing to engage in a breathing exercise by either sitting or standing in a quiet area. As you close your eyes to begin inhaling, ask yourself what thoughts, feelings, and sensations you are currently experiencing. Do this for one minute.
After one minute, redirect your focus on your breathing from inhale to exhale as you gather and focus your attention on physical sensations. As you exhale, do not let your mind wonder. Do this for another one minute.
During the final minute, expand your attention by including thoughts about your posture and facial expressions and search for any discomfort or tension. If so, concentrate your attention by imagining the intensity of your breath to the location of the pain.
Breathing has a dual impact: it’s a meditation that helps you to maintain compassion and thoughtfulness, and allows you to reduce stress and pressure by taking control of the situation.

, Most people believe that it is a fundamental act to close your eyes while performing meditation, but many forms of meditation require “open eyes” to avoid falling asleep. Most techniques want you to keep your eyes half open while others suggest you perform a full stare. Although both “eyes open” and “eyes shut” are acceptable while trying to find peace in your day. Start by focusing your eyes on a static point while relaxing your body. Take three deep breaths and as you exhale, relax your shoulders, jaw, and face.
Be aware of the world around you — sounds, smells, and temperature — to help you realize what you are thinking and feeling on the inside.
Accept all of the sensory information you are processing. It is important not to make an effort to control or change anything.
Remember that meditation is a practice. Just like any other exercise or sport, you must set aside time to develop your skills for practical use. Indeed, the goal of open eye meditation is to maintain a centered awareness while you perform the duties of life.

, There are several ways to relax your body sitting in a variety of positions. The most important factor is that you choose a position that affords you the most comfort. Although sitting in a chair is the easiest position, you should make sure that your spine is upright; your spine, shoulders, and head should be relaxed; and never slouch or slump over. Avoid putting yourself in a position that demands more flexibility than you really have. Remember the point is to be relaxed.
Place blocks of wood or a telephone directory to raise the back legs of the chair in order to make sure you are using correct posture: sit upright without having to either hold your back rigidly, or leaning against the back of the chair, only the base of your spine should touch the back of the chair.
Your hands should be on your thighs with your palms facing down unless you place a pillow on your lap then your palms should face up.
Keep your feet flat on the ground. If your feet cannot reach the ground, then place a folded blanket under your feet to keep them from dangling.

, If sitting in a chair is too easy and you cannot sit cross-legged, then you might want to consider just sitting on the floor. The floor is a safe venue for you to mediate because it provides solid base allowing you to concentrate on easing your mind. It is okay to just kneel or you can place a pillow or bench to support your full body weight. If you use pillows, make sure they are really firm and supportive (zafus are specially-designed pillows made for meditation).
Make sure the height of the pillows is appropriate, otherwise you might slump which causes discomfort, pinching, and a lack of concentration.
You can place your hands in several different positions, but it might be easiest if you just have your hands supported in front of you. If there is discomfort, you can always place another pillow or a blanket in front of you to rest your hands on.

, Similar to the half-lotus and full-lotus position in yoga, sitting cross-legged is the most difficult position to mediate in. Therefore, caution should be taken not to force yourself into this uncomfortable posture since it could cause long-term damage to muscles and joints. You also will not be able to concentrate if you are in pain. For mediators, the tailor position is the simplest and most common cross-legged position.
For this pose, make sure both your knees are on the ground for proper support. If you cannot get both knees on the floor, use a firm cushion or folded blanket to keep your knees stable by placing it under the knee that is not touching the ground.
If you cannot reach the complete position, trying doing yoga exercises to loosen your hips.

Show your loved ones how much you care about them.,
Practice the art of forgiveness.,
Accept love from others.,
Approach tense and stressful situations with understanding.",How to Find Your Inner Peace2," Always treat them with the love and respect that they deserve. It is easy to take out your built up stress and anger on the people who you are the closest to and love the most. Your partner can be a great person to vent your frustrations to but you must also remember to connect with them in other ways.Hold your partner and children’s hands.
Simply tell your family that you love them whenever you part ways.

, Let it go. Everyone makes mistakes in life, and no one is perfect. Holding on to inner anger, hurt, resentment, or any other internal pain will not serve your mind or body any good. If anything, when holding on to negative energy your body and mind will slowly deteriorate leaving you with feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. By practicing forgiveness, not only for others but also for yourself will help you release your inner turmoil, lifting the weight off your shoulders.

Forgiveness is not saying that you agree with what other people may have done to you, or accepting that it was okay. It means that you are just letting that hurt go so you can move on.

, Do not reject love that comes from friends, family, or even strangers. Sometimes low self-esteem or a rough past can make you feel as though you are not worthy of being loved. Everyone deserves love, regardless of the mistakes that you have made., It is easy to forget that other people are dealing with tough situations in their lives which can cause them to be rude or unkind. Instead of matching their rudeness with more rudeness, choose to come at them with kindness.For example, you are serving a table with a very rude woman. She has continuously insulted your serving skills and insists that you got her order wrong even when you know you did not. Try to remember that you do not know what is happening in this woman’s personal life. Choose to counter her anger with kindness by using polite words and a genuine smile.

See a therapist.,

You might also find a group therapy session to be helpful in achieving inner peace.Do your research on different religions and spiritual practices before attending a group session. You should have a basic knowledge of the religion or practice before attending so that you do not do something that is extremely offensive to their religion or culture.

Think … don’t overthink.",How to Redeem Yourself," Wrongdoing (or betrayal) can include a number of different situations. In general it means that you’ve broken some sort of agreement (formal or informal) with someone or something.Examples of possible wrongdoings — you might have wronged your spouse through cheating, broken someone’s trust by lying, or gone against your moral or ethical code by stealing something.;
, You know you’ve betrayed someone, so don’t wait to talk to this person when it is discovered via another means. Waiting for the other person to find out from someone else will only make things a lot worse, and will make a resolution much harder to accomplish., Committing any sort of wrong is hard to overcome. It may take the other person a long time to trust you again. You need to help achieve that trust by committing to be different or changing in the future. And once you’ve made that commitment, you need to actually follow through and be different or change., The person you wronged will likely ask you a lot of questions about what you did. This person will likely want to know all the details, including why you did it and what you were thinking. Work to answer these questions in a honest way that doesn’t end up blaming others.For example, if you cheated on your partner, they may ask you why you did it. If you seriously want to overcome the cheating and make your relationship work, blaming your partner for your cheating is not the answer. Instead you need to answer honestly about why you went ahead with the cheating — e.g. because you did not have enough confidence to talk to your partner about your needs and instead turned somewhere else to get satisfaction.

, The person you wronged is likely to have some pretty extreme emotions, and that person is also likely to want to share some or all of those emotions with you. You need to listen; after all, you were the cause of those emotions. Refrain from analyzing, evaluating or judging what the person is telling you.In this conversation (or multiple conversations) this person is simply expressing emotions — rational or not. You don’t need to agree to listen. But at the same time you need to realize that these are emotions, and emotions don’t always make sense.

, Depending on the extent of your wrongdoing, the healing process may take a very long time. You need to give the person you betrayed the time to regain the trust in you that used to exist, and you need to actively demonstrate you want that trust back., Do not attempt to make excuses, come up with rationalizations or justifications, or avoid explaining what happened or why it happened.For example, if you shoplifted don’t say you did it because all your friends do it too. This is an excuse where you are attempting to remove any personal blame for your personal actions. This type of excuse will not get back the trust of the person you betrayed.

, The three Rs of an apology are regret, responsibility and remedy. Regret means being empathetic and acknowledging that what you did was hurtful. Responsibility means to accept that you made a mistake and that it’s your responsibility to fix it and make amends. Remedy means that you realize you need to make up for your actions., One of the biggest aspects of an apology is your sincerity. This comes from the fact that you actually regret what you did and you realize you hurt someone. If you don’t feel sorry for what you did, or you either don’t accept or don’t care that you hurt someone with your actions, your apology will not be sincere.Regret doesn’t mean you admit you did anything hurtful on purpose. It means you realize that what you did was hurtful to another person and you’re sorry you hurt that person.
Some examples of how you can apologize such that you show your sincerity and regret are:

I’m very sorry for what I did. I really regret having hurt you.
I am so sorry. I realize I hurt your feelings and I feel absolutely awful about it.



, As with regret, taking responsibility doesn’t mean you intentionally meant to hurt anyone. Responsibility is demonstrating to the person you hurt that you are accepting the blame for what happened.Some examples of how you can apologize such that you take responsibility are:

I am very sorry. I know you’ve had trouble trusting people and me lying to you hasn’t made that any better. I should not have lied to you.
I am so sorry. There is absolutely no good excuse for what I did. I know I hurt you and I take full responsibility for that.



, You can’t take back what you said, or have a do-over, but you can make up for it somehow. This restitution to the person you hurt could be promising never to do it again, or to make up for the situation by doing something specific.Some examples of how you can apologize such that you offer a remedy are:

I am so sorry I made us late for the movie and we missed the start. Next time we go to the movies, it’s on me!
I regret having lied to you yesterday. It was totally the wrong thing to do and I will never do it again.
I’m sorry for treating you so badly at the meeting, I really do not know what got into me. I will do everything in my power to make sure that I never act like that again.



, Any and all apologies should be sincere. If you’ve decided to apologize for something because someone else told you you should, or because you realize that an apology will get you something in return, you’ve made the wrong decision. An apology like this will be noticed for its insincerity and will only make you come off worse., When we realize we’ve made a mistake, it can be really easy to try to come up with every excuse under the sun as to why it isn’t our fault. Before you apologize to the person you’ve hurt you need to recognize the mistake for what it is and forgive yourself first.Start by realizing you made a mistake and there are no good excuses for why it happened.
Think about what you did and how it’s affected other people. Think about how you’d feel if you were on the receiving end.
Recognize that humans make mistake and you are just a human. Forgive yourself for making the mistake and try to eliminate your feeling of guilt.
Work to forgive the other person, if required. If the mistake you made was because you’re in a conflict with this other person, you may also need to forgive them before you can apologize. In a situation like this you need to be the bigger person and recognize your mistake and take responsibility for it, even if the other person refuses to do so.
Plan out how you’re going to apologize, including what you’re going to say, how you’re going to make amends, and where you’re going to present the apology. Try not to apologize without at least a little bit of preparation or you may get tangled up in what you’re saying if you’re really nervous.

, Don’t rush the situation. The person you’ve wronged may need some time to think through what happened and decide what to do.When you talk to the person you’ve wronged, specifically tell this person you’ll follow-up after a certain period of time. Allow the person to inform you if more or less time is needed, or how the decision will be communicated.
Different situations require different amounts of time. If you forgot your wife’s birthday, she might need 24 hours to cool down and give you an answer. But if you hit a neighbour’s dog or crashed someone else’s car, several days or weeks may be needed to determine the best possible method for you to make amends.

, Once the person you’ve apologized to has had time to think about your apology, listen to the response this person gives you. It is important that you not only listen to what is said, but you read between the lines and understand what is meant.Listen intently to the person in an environment free from distractions. If you’re in a crowded coffee shop or in a place with TVs playing in the background, suggest relocating somewhere with less distractions.
Do not lose focus of the fact that the person is talking. If you’re too tired or have something on your mind that isn’t allowing you to fully concentrate, maybe this isn’t the best time to have this conversation.
Avoid trying to defend yourself if the person is upset or angry. This person may simply need some time to vent because you hurt them. Your job at this point is simply to listen.
Pay attention to your own body language. Look directly at the person talking. Make sure your facial expression is appropriate for what is being said. Don’t cross your arms in front of you. Nod or say yes to encourage the person to continue talking.
Repeat back to the person what was said in order to ensure you fully understand and to show the person you were sincerely paying attention.

, When you've gained experience at something, or have had time to generate a strong opinion about something, it can be hard to consider other perspectives or opinions. This behaviour can make you come across as thinking you’re always right or are too stubborn to listen. Allow yourself to consider other perspectives and options, and don’t assume you’re always right.This is especially important if you’ve wronged someone. Your initial thinking when you wronged them may have been that your perspective was the ‘right’ perspective, or that you were doing it for the right reasons. Re-evaluate that now and take a moment to understand the perspectives you did not consider before.

, Take a moment to realize that you have value. Realize that you deserve to be cared for and loved. Try to avoid endlessly judging and criticizing yourself for the wrong you have done. Show yourself the same level of compassion that you would show someone else.Show yourself self-compassion by writing yourself a letter. Pretend you’re someone else and write the letter to yourself providing advice and showing compassion.
Write down the negative thoughts or criticisms you’re saying or thinking to yourself. Read them over and consider whether you’d actually say those things to a friend.

, As children we often avoid doing things because we’re afraid of the outcome. Unfortunately we carry this behavior into our adult years and it prevents us from doing things that could otherwise benefit us. When you’re considering doing something new, don’t allow the fear of what might happen prevent you from giving it a try.Alternatively, you may have had a bad experience previously that is making you fearful of trying it again. For example, maybe you had a car accident when you were learning to drive, so you never bothered to get your driver’s license. Don’t allow this one mistake in your past to cause you to suffer in the future.
If you’ve wronged someone you may be hesitant to put yourself in a similar situation in the future for fear that you’ll repeat your mistake. Realize that you now know what you did wrong and you can focus on not repeating that mistake — you do not need to avoid the situation.

, The shame we feel can originate from a number of places, including our childhoods and what we were taught in school and at home. Most of the things that cause us to feel shame were learned subconsciously and as adults we continue to feel shame about these things because we haven’t been able to acknowledge who we really are.Your real self is who you want to be for your own personal reasons. It is not the self your parents or teachers wanted you to be for their reasons.
Showing your real self to others can not only be liberating, it can build deep relationships with those people. You may find yourself being able to relax around these people because you know they trust you and they won’t judge you.
You may have wronged someone based on a preconceived notion you subconsciously learned as a child. You are now feeling ashamed of yourself because the notions you used in the situation are not ones you actually believe in.

, Reality can be annoying, difficult and painful. And because of those annoyances, difficulties and pain, it can be tempting to pretend these realities don't exist. But it can also be dangerous to pretend these realities don’t exist. Take the chance to face your realities and you will likely find yourself feeling liberated, renewed and energetic.The reality is that you wronged someone. This reality will be hard to face and admit, but in order to heal and get past the hurt, you have to acknowledge the reality of what you did.

, If you have an analytical mind chances are you think about everything in your life in a lot of detail. This type of thinking can be useful at times, but can be damaging at other times. It is hard to change the way you think, but at the very least, try to recognize when you’re dwelling on something so you can identify its origin.If you find yourself dwelling on something, do something to distract yourself. Watch your favourite movie, read an interesting book, colour, go for a walk outside, etc.
Knowing you’ve wronged someone does mean you’re going to have to think about what you did, and think about potential solutions to the problem(s) you caused. But it doesn’t mean you have to dwell on the situation endlessly. Dwelling can lead to stress and anxiety.

Getting outdoors and focusing on nature can be even more helpful. Taking a walk will help you burn off some of that negative energy instantly and can help you get away from the problem. If you're in the middle of a heated argument, there's nothing wrong with saying, ""I'm going to go for a walk.""


Remember most situations do not require an immediate response. You can often leave the room or the building and give yourself time to cool down before responding to someone., If you're prone to fits of anger, then it's likely that your first impulse is not a good one. Maybe you want to kick your car, punch a wall, or scream at someone. Instead of acting on this initial impulse, ask yourself if what you want to do is a really good and productive thing to do. Take a minute to understand how you should really act and to consider what would calm you down the most.


Your first impulse may often be violent, destructive, and completely irrational. Don't make things worse for yourself by giving in to this kind of impulse.

, You may think that the last thing you want to do when you're really angry is to dance, which is precisely why you should do it. If you're feeling too caught up in your anger, turn on your favorite dance tune and start dancing and belting the lyrics. This will distract your toxic impulses through external stimuli.If this method really works for you, then you can even pick your go-to dance song to play every time you feel yourself getting overwhelmed by anger.

, Sit straight upright in a chair. Breathe in deeply through your nose, counting to 6. Then slowly breathe out, counting to 8 or 9. Pause and repeat 10 times.Try to focus only on your breathing, clearing your mind of whatever has upset you.

, Counting aloud or even whispering the numbers to yourself can make you instantly calm down in less than a minute. Try to keep your body calm while you do this, so that the only thing you have to worry about are the numbers. Focusing on this simple and concrete task will keep you from being overwhelmed in the moment and will make you face your problem with a more even head.


If you're still angry, repeat the exercise, or even count back from 100.

, Meditation can help you regulate your emotions. Therefore, if you are feeling as though you are going to lose control of your temper, give yourself a little mental vacation through meditation. Remove yourself from the situation causing the anger: go outside, to a stairwell, or even to the bathroom. Take slow, deep breaths. Maintaining this breathing will likely bring down your elevated heart rate. Your breaths should be deep enough that your belly extends on the “in” breath.
Visualize a golden-white light filling your body as you breathe in, relaxing your mind. When you breathe out, visualize muddy or dark colors leaving your body.
Making a habit of meditating every morning, even when you're not angry, will make you feel more calm in general.

, Close your eyes and imagine your favorite place in the world, whether it's the beach where you used to vacation as a child or the beautiful lake you still remember from your teenage days. It can also be a scene from a place you've never been before; a forest, a field of flowers, or a beautiful landscape. Pick a place that makes you instantly feel more calm and at peace and you'll quickly find your breath returning to normal.


Focus on every little detail. The more details you see, the more you can pull away from your angry thoughts.

, Unwinding to some of your favorite singers might calm you down and get you in the mood. Music is proven to make you feel a certain way when you hear it and bring back memories. It can calm people who are angry or agitated, even if they’re not aware of the source of that agitation.Classical music and jazz are particularly helpful for calming people down, but you have to find what works for you.

, You can help reduce your anger by trying to focus more clearly on your positive thoughts. Close your eyes, banish every negative thought that comes your way, and think of at least three positive things.The positive thoughts can be positive aspects of the situation you're worrying about, or just thoughts about something else you have to look forward to or something that makes you happy.
Some examples of positive thoughts include:

This will pass.
I am strong enough to handle this.
Challenging situations are opportunities to grow.
I will not feel angry forever; this is a temporary feeling.



, This means changing the way that you think about things. It can be easy to focus on the things that are making you angry to such an extent that you will begin to believe irrational things, like that everything in your life is bad. Cognitive restructuring encourages you to use rational and positive thoughts to have a more positive view of what is going on in your life.


For example, you might think “everything that happens to me is bad.” However, if you think rationally about things that happen to you, you may realize that a mix of good and bad things happen: you could get a flat tire, find a dollar on the ground, get in trouble at work, and get a surprise gift from a friend all in one day. This is a mix of good and bad, and if you spend more time focusing on the good in the group, you may feel better about your life.
Another example of replacing negative thoughts with positive is changing ""This always happens, and I can't stand it anymore!"" to ""This has happened a lot, and I've dealt with it successfully in the past; I will get through this.""

, Write down details about your feelings of anger. If you have an episode or event in which you lost control of your emotions, write it down. Be sure to include exactly how you felt, what caused you to be angry, where you were, who you were with, how you reacted, and how you felt afterwards.After you have kept your journal for a while, you should begin to look for commonalities among entries to identify the people, places, or things that trigger your anger.

, In addition to learning to calm yourself down when you get angry, try to understand the anger by identifying your triggers and working to reduce your anger response. Many people find that by identifying what things trigger their anger and assessing why they become so angry, they can work to reduce their emotional responses. , You may be making yourself more angry by instantly saying the first thing that comes to your head, which may lead you to fire yourself up, make the other person more angry, and generally to make the situation look and feel worse than it really is. When something angers you, take a moment to think about what is really at the source of your anger, and then say what you're really feeling.One form of positive communication is known as assertive expression of anger. Rather than expressing yourself passively (being angry without saying anything) or aggressively (exploding in a way that may seem disproportionate to the stressor), try assertive communication. To practice assertive expression, use the facts involved (not exaggerated by emotion) to communicate requests (rather than demands) of others in a respectful way. Communicate clearly and express your feelings effectively so that everyone’s needs are met.

, Many people can deal with anger problems at home. However, you may need to deal with an anger problem with professional help if the following are true: Insignificant things make you very angry.
When you’re angry, you display aggressive behaviors, including yelling, screaming, or hitting.
The problem is chronic; it happens over and over again.

, Anger management programs have been proven to be highly successful. Effective programs help you understand anger, develop short-term strategies to deal with anger, and build your emotional control skills. There are many options available for finding a program that is right for you. Individual programs may be available in your area for specific age groups, occupations, or life situations.
To find an anger management program that is right for you, try searching online for “anger management class” plus the name of your city, state, or region. You can also include search terms like “for teens” or “for PTSD” to find a group tailored to your specific situation.
You can also look for appropriate programs by asking your physician or therapist, or consulting the self-improvement course offerings at your local community center.

, The best way to learn to stay calm is to identify and treat the root of your anger problems. A therapist can give you relaxation techniques to use in situations that make you feel angry. She can help you develop emotional coping skills and communication training. Additionally, a psychoanalyst who specializes in helping resolve problems from someone’s past (such as neglect or abuse from childhood) can help mitigate anger tied to past events. You can search for a therapist specializing in anger management in North America here and in the United Kingdom here.

, Surround yourself with happy things. Whether they're scented candles, potted plants, or photographs of your friends and family,surround yourself with things that make you happy. Keeping your work or home space uncluttered, positive, and sunny can make you feel more positive and less stressed in your daily life.


The less clutter you have, the more easily you'll be able to accomplish your tasks. You'll be less prone to being angry if you can easily find everything you need.

, Part of the reason that you feel angry may be because you feel like you never have any time for yourself and are always stuck doing a bunch of things that you don't want to do.So, if you love to paint, read, or run, make enough time in your daily or weekly schedule to let yourself do that thing. You'll be less prone to anger because you'll spend more time being right where you want to be.


If you find that you really don't have something that you're passionate about or which really makes you happy, then you should try to find whatever it is to make yourself feel more at peace.

, Many people are familiar with the feeling of being “hangry” (hungry and angry). Avoid this feeling by remembering to eat healthy meals packed with protein, fruits, and vegetables. This will help you stave off hunger and blood sugar crashes. Be sure to start with a healthy breakfast, which will help you prepare for the rest of the day., You need to get plenty of sleep every night to thrive physically and emotionally.Being sleep deprived can contribute to a wide range of health problems, including the inability to manage emotions properly. Getting adequate sleep can help you stay calm in stressful situations.


If you have trouble sleeping, talk to a physician about dietary or lifestyle changes to improve your sleep. You may also wish to try medicinal sleep aids.

, This can be hard, especially when you're really, really upset. But smiling and laughing is proven to perk you up a little bit even when you're feeling mad, and laughing can change the chemical processes in your body that are making you feel angry. Spending more time laughing every day can make you take yourself less seriously and will make it easier for you to find the humor in a bad situation when the time comes.Read some jokes or when you feel better enough, get some friends to make you laugh. Maybe watch a funny video.

Whenever you feel nervous or anxious, take a few seconds to focus on your breathing.,
Focus on the present conversation.,
Seek out social situations where you're comfortable, and slowly build confidence in social situations where you aren't comfortable.,
Identify your ""safety behaviors"" and work on overcoming them.,
Stop trying to please other people by being someone you're not.,
Fake it until you make it.,
Meet new people and show them your best side.",How to Calm Down and Be Yourself1," Deep breathing is the single best relaxation technique. Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for three seconds, and slowly exhale through your mouth. Repeat three times, and feel the stress melt away. Do this whenever you start to feel anxious or stressed.


You can even do this method in the middle of a conversation.
Practice on your own. It seems simple enough, but deep breathing is a skill. Practice breathing with your diaphragm, which is right below the rib cage and above the stomach. Diaphragm breathing is the most relaxing and calming way to breath.
Be mindful of your breathing. When you start to get nervous or frustrated, you'll notice your breathing is sharp and quick, and your heart is pounding. This disrupts the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide leading to more anxiety problems like dizziness and muscle tension. When you're calm, your breath is slow and deliberate.
Meditate to focus in on your breathing. Sit still in a quiet place and focus on your rhythmic breathing until all your thoughts float away.;
, Too often we dwell on negative social interactions or we focus on our appearance. This distracts us from the present social situation, and we lose confidence to start new conversations.


Remember that social anxiety is hardly visible at all. Other people can't tell you're nervous. If you act confident and sociable, people will think you are.
Listen intently and think of things to say while somebody else is talking. Look them in the eyes. Nod your head. Occasionally respond or affirm things they said with an ""okay"" or a ""wow."" This will instantly make you a better conversationalist.
Be conscious of your thoughts when you're in a social situation. If you find yourself dwelling on negative thoughts like ""I was boring in that last conversation"" or ""Nobody wanted to talk to me,"" replace those thoughts with positive ones. Remember how well you were mingling earlier or how strong you present conversation is. After all, odds are your negative thoughts are based on misconceptions.

, This will help you build confidence. If you are at your best playing sports with friends or studying in a group or lounging on the beach, actively seek out those activities. If you're less comfortable in parties, start off going to small parties hosted by friends and only mingle with people you know. Slowly, go to parties where you're more out of your comfort zone.


Make a list of both kinds of social situations. Rank the settings and people from most comfortable to least comfortable. This way you know your strengths. Favor the activities at the top of the list.
Slowly go to the activities more towards the bottom of the list. Have friends come with you, and let them know if you're uncomfortable. They'll help you on your way.
If there are activities that you're confident you'll never be comfortable in, feel free to avoid them entirely.

, Safety behaviors are the crutches you use in social situations. Common safety behaviors are drinking to build confidence, avoiding eye contact, or frequently making excuses to leave conversations. While these can be used productively, they can also be very unhealthy as they let you avoid the underlying problem.


Write down all the safety behaviors you use. Go through your list and see if you abuse any of those behaviors. For instance, if you have to drink before any social setting where you're uncomfortable, that's abuse and you need to stop.
Slowly phase out safety behaviors that you identify as unhealthy. Do this by facing your fears. If you avoid eye contact, make an effort to look people in the eyes. Start small and practice eye contact with friends. Slowly work up to strangers.
Identify when you use which safety behaviors. The situations where you compensate the most are the situations you're the most afraid of. Face these fears last. Work on smaller fears first and work your way up.

, People like you for being you. Nobody likes a poser. If you bend over backwards to make people like you or to fit in, people will notice and you won't be happy. Focus on your own happiness first, and that will radiate and make other people happy too!


If you catch yourself saying a phrase just because other people say it, cut that phrase out of your dictionary.
Follow your intuition and avoid overthinking. Overthinking will only bog you down. Instead, act spontaneously. Spur of the moment decisions are more likely to embody your self than the person society wants you to be.
Don't replay parts of a conversation over again unless it's to remember something you did particularly well.
Remember that silences are not your fault, nor are they necessarily bad. Every conversation has lulls. Both parties have the responsibility to keep a conversation going.

, This is a tried and true method. Even if you don't feel happy or confident, smile and carry your body in a confident manner. This will trick your mind into believing you're happy and confident, and before long you'll actually be happy and confident.


Smile in the mirror. Try to do this every morning and even every time you go to the bathroom. Studies show that smiling even when you aren't happy will help you calm down and be happy.Similarly, do a ""power pose"" in the mirror. Puff out your chest, stretch your arms out to the side or put your hands on your hips, and stick up you chin. This will trick your mind into believing you're confident. Practice this regularly and you will actually start to become confident.
Practice proper posture throughout the day. Keep you shoulders back and your spine straight. Don't slouch and keep your head up. This will make you appear more confident.
Act sociable and friendly even when you don't fee like it. This will build a habit and make others see you as more friendly and happy. Their perception will quickly become a reality.

, Every new person you meet is a chance to show them your true self. If they don't like you, it's not the end of the world. You don't have to like them either. What's important is that you tried. The more friendly or recognizable faces you see in a room, the more comfortable and confident you'll be.


At parties or social gatherings, make a point to mingle and meet new people. Have a friend make an introduction.
Join clubs and groups. This is the best way to meet new people. If you like sailing, join a sailing club. If you're an avid reader, join a book club.
Exchange numbers with mutual friends and organize a time to meet up for coffee or lunch.
Keep in touch with people you meet by texting them occasionally.

Become mindful.,
Practice conscious physical immobility.,
Perform yoga.,
Count backwards.,
Come back to center.",How to Find Peace4," Throughout the day your mind might go on autopilot as you mindlessly rush around without much conscious thought about what you are doing. Our brains are constantly flooded with both visual and mental clutter as we endure the frenzied and chaotic world around us. Mindfulness exercises enable us to become more fully immersed in the present moment, and break the chain of stress and worry. As with many other meditation techniques, breathing exercises that concentrate on inhaling, exhaling, and the air moving throughout your body is important for bringing awareness to your center and ultimately back to your surroundings. This exercise brings mindfulness to the moment-by-moment awareness of thoughts, sensations, feelings, and a sense of the environment around you.
Eating is another way to achieve mindfulness. An example would be eating a raisin or other dried fruit that you can hold, feel its texture, see its color, smell, and taste it. As you eat the raisin, follow the same procedure as you swallow it. By eating the raisin, you have experienced the wide-range of senses in a mindful manner, taking note of how meaningful the exercise is.
Mindfulness can be achieved by carrying out everyday chores and activities. Similar to the raisin exercise, engage with every process of the exercise instead of mindlessly completing it like you usually do.
Try to only complete one mindful activity per day for about ten minutes. At the end of the week, write down your reactions to each experience and explain what it was like to engage in these activities in a more mindful manner. Most important, try to evaluate the difference between performing the activity mindlessly and mindfully.
Remember that mindfulness is about acceptance and non-judgment – the way they are – rather than trying to change or control the activity. Mindfulness is an exercise that requires practice and participation to fully benefit from it.

, Stillness is a high state of energy that provides undivided attention to experiencing the truth about yourself. Stillness is an absence of negative energy that is unopposed, dynamic, harmonious, and provides a new sense of aliveness. Achieving the highest levels of stillness will bring peace and spontaneously transform the way you think about yourself and how you view the world. Understanding yourself by being with yourself is the lowest level of stillness. First, pay attention to your body’s sensations as you practice being quiet both physically and mentally. This is accomplished by being wide awake and consciously relaxing your body in your current environment.
Let go of all your contradictory self-evaluations by reaching deep inside yourself to experience yourself and find your true identity. After you resolve your internal conflict and turmoil, you will experience peace.
Once you achieve this stage, you can move onto living your daily life with confidence of your new found certainty. This means staying in touch with the truth about yourself at all times throughout the day and letting go of judgments, evaluations, and false opinions about yourself.
Stay centered on your inner peace to keep your perspective grounded. This will help validate your new identity to yourself and to others.

, Yoga helps you uncover and discover your true nature so that you can live with your new awareness. Experiencing your true nature – thoughts, feelings, and emotions – through yoga will enable you to move into stillness. These behaviors, in turn, determine how you think, what you do, and how you interact with the environment. In short, it could factor in your quality of life. Although many yoga poses will help you achieve both peace and stillness, the corpse pose, or Savasana, is an easy pose to begin with. This pose is lying on your back, arms and legs spread at 45 degrees, with deep breathes. This position is meant for total relaxation and releasing tension.
Stay in the present, keep your eyes shut, and be aware of your surroundings.
Relax your facial muscles and breathe deeply and slowly through your nose.
Starting at the top of the head and working your way down to the feet, bring your attention to each part of your body, consciously relaxing it before proceeding on to the next.
Perform this for three to five minutes and avoid falling asleep.

, Counting backwards is a breathing exercise meant to calm your body, bring stillness, and achieve peace during a busy day. Simply find a quiet space and count backwards from fifty to zero while synchronizing the numbers with your breathing. Even numbers are for exhaling and odd numbers are for inhaling. This also helps with counting in case you lose track. Try counting only on exhales.
Make sure your back is straight and your eyes are closed. You can sit on a chair or on the floor, whichever is more comfortable.
When you reach zero, stop counting but be aware of the natural state of your breathing.
Breathe normally as the goal is to stay in control by breathing freely without deep breathes.
By counting backwards, you remain centered and develop concentration, but you also become aware of your thoughts and surroundings as your mind becomes active during the process.

, Typically, motionless sitting is the easiest way to achieve stillness, but this does not necessarily mean you have to be physically motionless. Instead, you should become more familiar with the energy of stillness through the practice of motionless sitting. Spend only a few seconds doing this exercise, but try to do it often throughout the day.
Motionless sitting can be performed at your desk at work, driving in the car, in the midst of conversation, or even during a meal. The goal is to feel peace and happiness, therefore, try coming back to center many times throughout the day.

Spend time with friends and family.,
Engage in meaningful work.,
Believe in yourself.,
Seek professional advice.",How to Find Peace5," Sometimes having inner emptiness or loneliness is filled with a busy lifestyle. What you might be missing is love and support. Visiting with friends and family can help fill that void by helping you to relax and give balance to your busy life.Talking with people you love and trust is a good way to relieve stress, think positive, and take your mind off of work and other pressing issues.
Regardless of how busy your weekly schedule is, take one day of the week to dedicate to friends and family. Your body and mind will appreciate it.
Family and friends also provide companionship, camaraderie, and happier encounters that reduce feelings of loneliness and stress.

, Recent research illustrates that participating in meaningful work, like volunteering, is linked to increased well-being, lower rates of depression, and reduced risk of dying.Instead of laying around the house all day, consider getting out and volunteering. The benefits of good physical activity and helping others are sure to get you in a good frame of mind.
Making social connections with human beings and not your computer or cell phone will make you feel good because humans were created to see, touch, and interact with each other. Biologically, this interaction releases the hormone oxytocin, which is associated with bonding, caring, and reducing stress levels.
Volunteering is a feel-good activity that should give you a deep sense of worth and happiness.

, There are times when even the best human being occasionally acts on impure motivations. We tell small lies to avoid larger problems, act improperly to get social approval, or console a friend or acquaintance to get a favor in return. Although these actions are not necessarily illegal, they do build up and come with guilt and other unsavory feelings.Think about the true motivations for your actions by asking yourself what the real reason is for doing something. In other words, don’t lie to yourself or others. Believe your reason is a good reason.
Believing in yourself and telling the truth about why you do what you do will gradually cleanse your inner self.
It would be a good idea to separate yourself from individuals who continue to lie and deceive so that you do not fall back into that pattern.
Continue to cleanse your mind and soul of inappropriate thoughts as move through life and you will eventually choose activities that connect you to things you enjoy and the people you love.

, If you are struggling to find inner peace by yourself, then you should consider finding a psychologist or a therapy treatment. Professional counselors will examine your mood, anxieties, focus, and your relationships to find a treatment plan to address your issues.Professional psychologists are highly trained in clinical evaluation and assessment to help people cope more effectively with finding peace. You should never be afraid to seek out professional help.
Many people believe that professional psychologists only treat people with severe mental problems like depression, anger management, or other brain traumas, but, in reality, they can help with a wide range of health problems, including physical problems.
Psychologists also work with primary care physicians, pediatricians, and psychiatrists to help you find peace medically, physically, or therapeutically.

Keep a journal.,
Be conscious of your thoughts.,
Build positive relationships and learn about yourself through others.,
Get in touch with your younger self.",How to Calm Down and Be Yourself2," Get in touch with yourself by writing down your thoughts and writing about events in your life. This introspection will be therapeutic and get you to be comfortable with yourself.


Write down anything and everything you want. You can't write anything that's wrong. Write the first thing that comes to your head.
Write your most personal thoughts and ideas. Don't be self-conscious about what you write. You're the only one that will ever see it.
Write about yourself. Get to know your thoughts and actions more intimately. Instead of going through life without thinking about what you do, be conscious of your actions and why you do them. If you don't like what you do and think, you'll learn that about yourself. You'll also find areas of yourself that you love!
List things you like and things you don't like about yourself. For every entry, write a way to keep doing the positive or a way to improve the negative.

, One of the biggest challenges to being yourself is lingering negative thoughts. These negative thoughts are almost always baseless and self-destructive. Once you're aware of your negative thoughts you can overcome them. Work on replacing them with positive thoughts!


Write down you negative thoughts as they happen. Once they're written down, you can work on changing them.
Analyze those negative thoughts. Why are you having them? Are they even true? Are there any counter-examples? Are they productive or destructive? Do you fixate on those thoughts? Answer these questions and more about every negative thought you have. Before long, you'll start to realize how absurd and counterproductive your negative thoughts are.
Replace negative thoughts with positive ones. Instead of ""I'm always left out of conversations,"" think ""I had a great conversation earlier"" or ""I had all these interesting and funny things to say, but I chose not to."" Instead of ""Nobody thinks I'm clever"" think of that one time you made a great pun and everybody cracked up. Make a habit of focusing on the positive.
Laugh at yourself. Laughter really is the best medicine. Once you can identify your negative thoughts, you'll start to realize how baseless they are. After a while, those thoughts can be funny. Once you can laugh at your negative thoughts, you've conquered them.

, Actively seek new relationships and work on building your current relationships. Initiate meet ups with friends or strangers. Finally, reflect on your relationships and your communication skills and shortcomings. Notice patterns in the people you choose to hang out with, and seek more people like that. Take note of the way you talk and interact, and work on improving that.


If you prefer people who do active things with you like skiing or bowling, that means you're probably an active person too. Keep having active social meetings.
If you have problems maintaining relationships or starting conversation, practice those skills with friends. take social skills classes. These are often offered at local adult education centers, and they can be enormously beneficial.
Play to your strengths. If you find people laughing at your jokes often, have your communication center around jokes.
Ask your friends about yourself. Have an honest conversation with them about your personality. Ask what you can improve on and what you're already good at. One of the best ways to learn about yourself is through other people.

, Over time, you get socialized to be someone you're not. This happens to everyone. But when you're young, social norms haven't instantiated themselves on you. Remember what's it's like to be young and carefree again, and channel that pure version of yourself in social scenarios.


Within reason, try acting on impulse. Your intuitive actions are more likely to represent your true self rather than your socialized self.
Don't worry about being judged. Just do what you want and forget the haters.
Appreciate the moment. Don't dwell on the past or focus on the future. Love each moment and get caught up in the present.
When you were young, you didn't care what other people thought. You listened to the music you wanted, you read what you wanted, you said what you wanted, and you did what you wanted. Try to recapture that mentality.
Read old books you used to like or do things you used to like as a kid. Do cartwheels or build a sandcastle!

Try yoga and meditation.,
Exercise!,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Quit smoking and drink only in moderation.,
If these steps don't work, consider going to a therapist or taking medication.",How to Calm Down and Be Yourself3," Your breath and thought largely determine your behavior.Wake up early and do 15 minutes of yoga every morning. When you feel stressed, take a break and meditate. This can be enormously calming. You'll feel more comfortable and your body will relax.



Learn yoga by using a video online or going to a local class.

Learn how to meditate by practicing calming breathing techniques in a quiet place.
You can do yoga or meditation virtually anywhere, even in the middle of a conversation. Do yoga stretches on an airplane or meditate for a few seconds when you feel nervous during a party.

, Physical activity is scientifically proven to reduce stress, fight anxiety, and boost self-esteem.Exercise also releases pleasure-inducing endorphins. Even just 15 minutes of exercise a day can help you settle down and be happy.


Exercise doesn't have to be in the gym. You can go for a run or play pick up basketball with friends. In fact, exercising with friends can be more fun and more beneficial than working out alone.
Set a work out plan and stick to it. Decide when and how often you want to work out. Aim to exercise significantly four times a week, while still getting some physical activity every day.
Walking or riding your bike to work rather than driving is a great way to work in exercise to your everyday routine.
Exercise also has enormous health benefits like increased energy levels and a stronger heart, both of which will help you calm down and be more confident.

, Doctors recommend seven to nine hours of sleep every night. When you're sleep deprived, you're more at risk for anxiety and depression. However, when you're well rested, you're more likely to stay calm and composed in social situations.


Beware of oversleeping. Sleeping ten hours or more can make your problems worse.
Avoid caffeine and chocolate. These will keep you up late and independently act as stimulants which increase anxiety symptoms., Nicotine is a stimulant that leads to greater anxiety levels and lower self esteem. Drinking also acts as an unhealthy crutch. It can seem like a good solution, but in reality alcohol increases your chances of an anxiety attack.


Make a plan to quit smoking. Tell your family and friends what you're doing, and go to meetings. Use nicotine patches and reward yourself for going without a cigarette.
Similarly, make a plan to quit drinking or cut back significantly. Always be conscious of how much you're drinking. If you're having trouble, consider going to alcoholics anonymous.

, About 13 percent of the population suffers from some kind of social anxiety so you are not alone.Self-help doesn't work for everybody, and at some point, you need to get help.


Tell your family and friends about your condition first. They want to help you and they can give you the same or better help that a therapist would give you.
Don't self-medicate. Seek a doctor first. They'll refer you to a specialist who can give you beta blockers or antidepressants to fight the symptoms of social anxiety. They won't fight the underlying cause, however. If you stop taking your medication, the problem will likely come back full force.
Always try self-help methods first, but there's nothing to be ashamed about in seeking professional help. In fact, it can be incredibly difficult and brave.

Stop what you're doing.,
Re-focus your senses.,
Breathe.,
Relax your muscles.,
Distract yourself.,
Use self-soothing behaviors.,
Use soothing touch.",How to Calm Down Quickly2," One of the best ways to calm down is to stop interacting with what’s upsetting you. In the short term, this may mean telling the person you’re speaking with that you need to take a quick break. If you’re with company, politely excuse yourself for a moment. Get to a quiet place away from what’s upsetting you and focus on calming thoughts.

, When we're anxious, upset, or angry, our bodies go into ""flight or fight"" mode. Our sympathetic nervous system kicks our bodies into high gear by activating hormones like adrenaline. These hormones boost your heart rate and breathing, tense your muscles, and constrict blood vessels.Take a break from what is causing this stress response and focus on what your body is experiencing. This can help you stay in the present and reduce what's known as ""automatic reactivity.""""Automatic reactivity"" happens when your brain forms habits of reacting to stimuli, such as stressors. You brain activates these habitual pathways whenever it encounters that stimulus. Studies have shown that breaking the circuit of this reaction by refocusing on what your sensory experiences actually are can help your brain make new “habits.”Don’t judge your experiences, just acknowledge them. For example, if you’re really angry about something someone just said, your heart is probably beating faster, and your face may be flushed or feel hot. Acknowledge these sensory details, but don’t judge them as being “wrong” or “right.”, When your body’s sympathetic nervous system is activated by stress, one of the first things to go is your calm, even breathing. Focusing on breathing deeply and evenly has a host of benefits. It restores oxygen to your body, regulates your brain’s brainwaves, and decreases the level of lactate in your blood. These things help you feel calm and relaxed.Breathe from your diaphragm, not your upper chest. If you place your hand on your belly just below your ribs, you should be able to feel your abdomen rise when you inhale and fall when you exhale.
Sit upright, stand, or lie flat on your back to help your chest stay open. It’s harder to breathe when you’re slouched. Inhale slowly through your nose for a count of 10. You should feel your lungs and belly expand as they fill with air. Then, slowly exhale through your nose or mouth. Aim for 6-10 deep, cleansing breaths per minute.
Focus on the rhythm of your breathing. Try not to let yourself get distracted by anything else, including how upset you might feel. You can count your breaths if you feel yourself getting distracted, or repeat a calming word or phrase.As you breathe in, envision a beautiful golden light that represents love and acceptance. Feel its relaxing warmth spread from your lungs to your heart, and then throughout your body. As you slowly exhale, imagine that all of your stress is leaving your body. Repeat 3 or 4 times.

, When emotional or stress responses occur, your body’s muscles tense and tighten. You may literally feel “wound up.” Progressive Muscle Relaxation, or PMR, can help you consciously release the tension in your body by tensing and then releasing particular muscle groups. With a little practice, PMR can help you bust stress and anxiety very quickly.There are several free guided PMR routines available online. MIT has a free eleven-minute audio guide to PMR.Find a quiet, comfortable place. It should be relatively dark.
Lie down or sit comfortably. Loosen or remove tight clothing.
Focus on a particular muscle group. You can start at your toes and work up, or start with your forehead and work down.
Tense all the muscles in that group as hard as you can. For example, if you’re starting with your head, raise your eyebrows as far as they will go and open your eyes wide. Hold for 5 seconds, then release. Squeeze your eyes shut tightly. Hold for 5 seconds, then release.
Move to the next muscle group and tense those muscles. For example, purse your lips tightly for 5 seconds, then release. Then, smile as wide as you can for 5 seconds, then release.
Progress through the rest of your muscle groups, such as neck, shoulders, arms, chest, stomach, buttocks, thighs, lower legs, feet, and toes.

, If you can, distract yourself from worrying over what has you upset. If you allow yourself to focus on what has upset you, you could set off a cycle of ruminating, where you think the same thoughts over and over again. Ruminating fosters anxiety and depressive symptoms.Distraction is not a long-term solution, but it can be a good way to get your mind off your troubles long enough for you to calm down. Then, you can return to deal with the issue with a clear head.Chat with a friend. Socializing with someone you love will help take your mind off what has upset you and will help you feel relaxed and loved. Studies have shown that rats who are able to socialize with each other develop fewer ulcers from stress than rats who are all alone.Watch a happy movie or a funny TV show. “Silly humor” can help calm you down and get some distances from what’s upset you. Try to keep away from bitter or sarcastic humor, however, as it may make you angrier, not less.Listen to some soothing music. Find music with around 70 beats per minute (Classical and soft “New Age” pop like Enya are good choices). Angry or driving beats may actually make you feel more upset, not less.Look at pictures that give you a lift. Humans are biologically prone to find small things with big eyes -- like puppies and babies --- adorable. Looking up some cute kitten pictures may actually inspire a chemical “happiness” reaction.Go somewhere and shake all your limbs, like a wet dog does. “Shaking it off” may help you feel better because it gives your brain new sensations to process., Self-soothing behaviors can help you reduce immediate feelings of stress and anxiety. They focus on comforting and being kind to yourself.Take a warm bath or a hot shower. Research has shown that physical warmth has a soothing effect on many people.Use calming essential oils, such as lavender and chamomile.Play with your pet. Petting your dog or cat has a soothing effect and can even lower your blood pressure., When humans are touched with kindness, our bodies release oxytocin, a powerful mood elevator.While you can also get this boost from a friendly hug, you can also relax yourself with your own touch.


Put your hand over your heart. Focus on the warmth of your skin and the beat of your heart. Allow yourself to breathe slowly and evenly. Feel your chest expand as you inhale and fall as you exhale.
Give yourself a hug. Cross your arms over your chest and put your hands on your upper arms. Give yourself a little squeeze. Notice the warmth and pressure of your hands and arms.
Cup your face with your hands. You can stroke the muscles of your jaw or near your eyes with your fingertips. Run your hands through your hair. Give yourself a scalp massage.

Check your dietary habits.,

Avoid upsetting scenarios when possible.,
Express your feelings.,
Spend time with others who calm you.,
See a therapist or counselor.",How to Calm Down Quickly3," The body and mind are not separate entities. What one does directly impacts the other, and this is true for your diet as well. Reduce caffeine. Caffeine is a stimulant. Too much can make you feel jittery and anxious.Eat foods high in protein. Protein can help you feel fuller for longer, and can keep your blood sugar from plummeting or spiking throughout the day. Lean proteins such as poultry and fish are great choices.Complex carbohydrates with a lot of fiber may cause your brain to release serotonin, a relaxing hormone. Good options include whole-grain breads and pastas, brown rice, beans and lentils, and fruits and vegetables.Avoid high-sugar and high-fat foods. These can make you feel more stressed and upset.Limit alcohol intake. Alcohol is a depressant, so it may initially make you feel calmer. However, it can also cause depressive symptoms, and it may make you feel on edge. It can interfere with your healthy sleep patterns, which will make you more irritable., Physical exercise releases endorphins, your body’s natural “feel-good” chemicals.You don’t have to be a bodybuilder to get this effect, either. Research has shown that even moderate exercise, such as walking and gardening, can help you feel calmer, happier, and more relaxed.Exercises that combine meditation with gentle movement, such as Tai Chi and Yoga, have been shown to have positive effects on anxiety and depression. They can reduce pain and increase feelings of well-being., Meditation has a long and respected history in Eastern traditions. Scientific studies have also shown that meditation can promote relaxation and feelings of well-being. It can even rewire how your brain deals with outside stimuli.There are many types of meditation, although ""mindfulness"" meditation is one of the types with the most research support.You don't even have to leave your house to learn how to meditate. MIT has several downloadable meditation MP3 files.So does the UCLA Mindful Awareness Research Center., Stressors can build up so gradually that we are not even aware of them. In many cases, it’s not one big event that makes you lose your cool but a mountain of small annoyances and irritations that have built up over time.Try to distinguish between primary and secondary emotions. For example, if you were supposed to meet a friend at the movies and s/he never showed, you might immediately feel hurt. That would be the primary emotion. You might then feel frustrated, disappointed, or angry. These would be the secondary emotions. Having an idea of the source of your feelings can help you figure out why you’re experiencing these feelings.More often than not, you’ll feel more than one thing at once. Try to sort through what you are feeling and give each experience a name. Once you have named your emotion, you will have a better sense of how to handle it.One common reason people feel upset is that they believe things ought to go a certain way (usually, their way). Remind yourself that you will never be able to control everything in life -- nor should you want to.Don’t judge these emotional responses. Acknowledge and try to understand them.

, Obviously, it’s impossible to never become upset. Experiencing unpleasant or troubling events and experiences is part of being human. However, if you are able to remove stressors from your life, you will be able to better handle the ones that you simply can’t avoid.You can try to “outsmart” upsetting situations. For example, if you find getting stuck in rush hour traffic upsetting -- and who doesn’t? -- you could consider leaving earlier or later from work, or find an alternate route.
Look for the bright side. Reframing upsetting situations as learning experiences can help you stay calm because you're giving yourself some power. Rather than just being something that happens to you, the situation becomes something you can use to learn for the future.If people are upsetting you, consider why. What exactly about their behavior is bothering you? Are you doing the same things as they are? Trying to understand a person’s motivation may help keep you from being as upset. Remember, we’re all human, and we all have bad days.

, There is nothing inherently unhealthy with any emotion, including anger.What can be unhealthy is ignoring or repressing your feelings instead of acknowledging them.Acknowledging your feelings doesn’t mean you mope or feel sorry for yourself, or that you blow your lid and rage at others. Instead, you acknowledge that you are human, and that experiencing a range of emotions is natural for humans. Your feelings occur, and they should not be judged. Your responses to your emotions are what you’re in charge of.Once you have acknowledged your feelings, think about how you can respond to them. For example, it may be perfectly natural to feel angry if your contribution to a big project has been overlooked, or if a romantic partner has been unfaithful to you. However, you have a choice whether you let your anger explode, or whether you use techniques such as those in this article to calm yourself down and handle your feelings with care.

, Research has shown that humans tend to let others’ emotions “rub off” on us. The anxiety levels of those we spend time with can affect our own. Spend time with people whom you find relaxing and calming, and you’ll feel more calm yourself.Try to spend time with people whom you feel support you. Feeling isolated or judged can increase feelings of stress.

, A common myth is that you have to have huge “issues” to see a therapist, but this isn’t true. A therapist can help you process your feelings and learn to cope with even everyday anxiety and stress in more healthy, helpful ways.Many organizations provide therapy and counseling services. Contact a community clinic or health center, hospital, or even a private provider for services.

, If you are standing, sit down and if you are sitting, lie down on a nearby sofa or on the floor. This helps you to relax for a while and also diverts your attention, to some extent, from the reason that made you angry.

Start the process with a dedicated stretch of time – 15 minutes is a good starting point – to practice. , Suggestions from the Buddha are under a tree in the forest or a very quiet, isolated location. The key is to be somewhere you can be completely comfortable and away from as many distractions as possible.Being in a room alone may do the trick, but beware of sounds from adjacent rooms or from outside.
A light, open room with plenty of space can aid in the meditation process, and an unkempt room can harm the process.Do not try to soundproof the location. Having some exterior sounds can actually aid the process., Cross your legs and sit in an erect posture at roughly a 90 degree angle. Sitting for long periods with a curved back could cause pain or fatigue and distract you from the meditation process. An additional benefit is the core muscle focus required to sit straight for an extended period of time.If you have back issues, and a normal, crossed-leg position is uncomfortable, then using a chair may help you to get into the correct posture.
To put your body at peace, you may have to sit for a long period of time. Ensure the position is one you can sit comfortably in for quite some time.
Various meditation positions such as Half or Full lotus are also acceptable., Once you sit down and find your comfortable position, close your eyes and start relaxing. Closing your eyes will help you to reduce distractions and allow yourself to completely focus on mediation., You do not have to change the way that you breathe. Just breathe naturally and think about the pathway of the breath moving from the nostrils, down your chest, filling your lungs and abdomen., Focusing on a specific part of your respiratory system, like your nostrils, lungs, or diaphragm, will help your mind to stay focused. It sharpens your attention.It’s possible to become somewhat sleepy when you are really focusing on breathing. Refocus your attention to the breathing, letting your mind and concentration take control.

, Awareness of the different sensations during the breathing process, how the chest and abdomen rise and lower, should be continuous. Do not segment the breathing just so you can identify each part or each muscle movement. Instead, just breathe deeply and identify when each part is happening.


It may help to associate the process with simple words or phrases (e.g. full, empty, high, low) and think about them while breathing.Sometimes placing a palm on the abdomen helps focus on the breathing., Do not focus on the muscles or the abdomen itself. Think about the movement on the outside of the abdomen. Imagine the movement going forward and backward, as if there were a general line at the starting and ending point.


Think of this process as a buoy’s movement in the water. When focusing on a buoy, you notice the movement of the buoy. It floats up and down, and you hardly notice the actual water forcing the movement., Whenever there is an outside noise, any sort of disturbance, you should consciously and immediately focus awareness towards that sound. Just as you labeled the rising and falling of the abdomen, label the exterior sound in your mind., If your mind is playing tricks on you, or convincing you to stop, you may need to set a specific limit or focus. Avoid the internal distraction by telling yourself to meditate for just one minute per day without distraction. Or try to focus solely on a single rise or fall of the abdomen. Repeat the process until you’re in a natural rhythm and can expand into longer periods of meditation., Once the disturbance is noted and labeled, and your meditation is focused, return to breathing. It’s possible for the meditation process to bounce back and forth from distraction to breathing fairly regularly. Remain undistracted by living in the current moment, embracing interaction, and allowing a connection between breathing and the outside world to occur naturally.


The process can be free of thought, just allowing the mind to focus on the surroundings. If you’re distracted, refocus on your breathing until you can establish a calm understanding of smaller sounds around you."

Reframe your perspective for a calmer lifestyle.",How to Calm Down After a Long Day," Breathing can be very calming and therapeutic. You take so many breaths each day without ever thinking about it, but most of that breathing is shallow and only reaches the chest. Deep breathing requires you to measure your breathing patterns and take long, slow breaths that extend all the way down into your belly.Breathe in slowly through your nostrils to the count of four.
Hold in your breath to the count of four.
Exhale slowly to a count of four, either through your nostrils or though pursed lips.
Rest for a count of four without taking any breaths until you've hit the four count.
Take two normal breaths.
Repeat the whole process. You should start to feel calmer fairly quickly.;
, Meditation is an excellent way to relieve stress and fatigue, alleviate the symptoms of mental/emotional conditions like anxiety and depression, and even reduce the symptoms of physical pain/discomfort.It doesn't matter how you meditate; if you sit in silent meditation, you will quickly feel the calming effects.Find a quiet, calm place free from distractions. Turn off your television and silence your cellphone.
Get into a comfortable position. You can sit on a cushion or the floor with your legs folded, sit upright in a chair, or even lie down.
Take slow, deep breaths down into your diaphragm (below your ribcage). Aim for an even, steady breathing pace.
Focus your attention on your breathing. Notice the sensations of breath: the way air feels as it passes through your nostrils, the feeling of your belly rising and falling, and so on.
Any time your mind gets distracted and you start thinking outside thoughts, simply return your focus to your breathing.
You can sit in meditation for as brief or as long a period of time as you would like. The important thing is to set aside some uninterrupted time to practice breathing and meditating.

, Mindfulness is a form of meditation that can help you lower your stress levels, reduce unpleasant distractions, and improve your overall mood.Mindfulness can be practiced any time throughout the day, but may be particularly helpful for when you need to disengage from a stressful day.Focus on your breathing. Take slow, deep breaths through your nostrils and down into your diaphragm.
Pay close attention to everything around you. Notice your immediate environment and all of the sensory details (sight, smell, sound, feel) present in that space.
Dive into your senses. If you eat something, notice the way it looks, the way it smells, the way it feels in your hands, the way it tastes, and the texture of the food as you slowly and mindfully chew it.

, Reading is a great way to unwind after a long day. It can also help your body and mind relax and get ready for bed.


Try avoiding books/magazines about stressful topics like war, crime, or terrorism.
Choose a book that lets you delve into the fictional world within its pages.

, Music is often used as a tool to help manage stress, anxiety, and depression. If you're trying to calm down after a long day, try listening to music that soothes you. You can do this at home as well as in the car on your commute home from work/school.Choose something relaxing. It doesn't have to be classical music, though it can be if you enjoy it. The goal is to spend time listening to music that takes you out of a stressful moment.
If you don't have any relaxing music of your own, try listening to jazz. It can be very soothing while still being upbeat, and the fact that it's often all instrumental may help your mind disengage from your stressful day.

, Exercising is a great way to get outdoors, but you don't have to be active to sit outside and enjoy the fresh air. Sometimes simply being outside the house - especially if you live near nature - can calm your anxious mind and reduce your stress levels.Try sitting outside. You can watch the sunset, or simply set aside a half hour before or after dinner to enjoy a cup of decaffeinated tea outdoors.
If you have a porch or patio you can sit there. If not, you can simply sit in the grass, or set up a lawn chair in your yard.

, If you're feeling tense after a long day, a hot shower or bath can help relieve sore muscles and reduce your stress levels.Just make sure you don't make the water too hot so that you don't burn yourself.

, Though it may not always be possible, it's best to disengage from your work life when you come home. Some individuals may be required to read and respond to emails at home, be on call in case of a situation, or take tasks home to complete. These individuals won't have much choice, as failing to do these things could lead to discipline or even dismissal. However, if you're allowed to leave your work at your place of employment when you clock out, it's best to do so.


Unless you're required to, resist the urge to check or respond to work emails. They'll still be there in the morning, and dealing with them at home after a long day could make you more stressed out.
Try not to think about work. It may be difficult, especially if something at work is stressing you out or you have a deadline looming, but if you can distance your home life from your work stress you'll be much better off.

, Depending on your personality, you may want to choose a sport or form of exercise that won't cause you any further stress. The last thing you want to do is come home from a long day and feel angry or frustrated with yourself or others.If you want to run, try running alone. Or, if you want to run with others, train yourself to stop seeing it as a race or competition.
Bicycling is a great form of exercise that can be done on your own. You can even incorporate biking into your day by riding to and from work/school instead of driving.
If you're prone to having a competitive mindset, consider a less intense form of exercise like Pilates or yoga. These are workouts that you can do alone or in groups and there's no element of competition.
Ultimately, the form of exercise you choose should be something you enjoy doing.

, Exercise should be a regular part of every healthy lifestyle. However, it's important that you don't try to push yourself too hard without the proper training or muscle development.You may end up injuring yourself if you attempt to do too much too soon.
Start small and work your way up. For example, try going for long walks before you take up running.

, It may feel daunting to think about when you can find time to work out. After work you'll have the commute home, then you'll need to make dinner and tend to any domestic responsibilities. However, exercise doesn't have to be done all at once in a long, exhausting block. You can cater your workout schedule to meet your needs by working around other obligations.If you can't make time for a long block of exercise or if you're not yet physically capable of longer workouts, try breaking it up into chunks that can be incorporated throughout your day.
For example, if 30 minutes is too much, try spacing out three 10-minute workout sessions.
You might also try interval training, which alternates between short bursts of high-intensity exercise lasting around 60 to 90 seconds with periods of lower-intensity walking/jogging.

, If you're stressed out after a long day, working out may be the last thing on your mind. But studies show that exercise can help relieve stress by releasing endorphins and improving your overall mood.Exercise can actually work similar to meditation. It takes your mind off of your problems and forces you to focus on the task at hand.
Exercise should be part of an overall healthy lifestyle, including lifestyle changes that you make to reduce or manage stress.
Talk to your doctor before beginning any new exercise regimen to be sure that you are physically healthy enough to participate.

, An overall healthy lifestyle, including a healthy and balanced diet, can help you better manage stress and make you feel better in general.Part of eating a balanced diet requires you to make good choices about what kinds of foods you eat and how much you eat in each meal.For each meal, approximately half of your plate should consist of fruits and vegetables.
Most adults should be eating six to eight ounces of grains each day. When you eat grains, choose whole grains instead of refined grains.Make sure you eat five to six-and-a-half ounces of lean protein each day, depending on your age and sex. That can include tofu, beans, eggs, nuts/seeds, poultry, fish, or lean meat.Try to limit yourself to five or six teaspoons of oil (or the equivalent) each day. When you do use oils, opt for plant-based oils (like coconut, palm oil, and olive oil), as these have very little if any cholesterol.Opt for low-fat or fat-free dairy products, and aim to get about three cups of dairy (or non-dairy substitutes) per day., Your quantity and quality of sleep can affect your ability to cope with stress throughout the day.Make sure you're getting enough sleep each night, and take steps to ensure that the sleep that you get is restful.Most adults need between seven and nine hours of sleep, though some individuals may need even more sleep to feel fully rested.
Follow a sleep schedule, even on weekends and before days off.Find something to do before bed that relaxes you. Try to make it a nightly ritual.
Block light out of your room using thick curtains or blinds.
Avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening, as it can easily interrupt your normal sleep schedule.
Alcohol can also affect your sleep. It's best to avoid drinking in order to protect your quality of sleep.
Turn off or avoid all electronic products at least 30 minutes before bed. The glare of a cellphone, computer, tablet, or television screen can suppress your body's melatonin production and upset your circadian rhythm.Keep your room on the cool side, but not so cold that you're uncomfortable. Experts generally recommend keeping your bedroom between 60 and 67 degrees Fahrenheit (15.5 to 19.5 degrees Celsius), but if you need it slightly warmer go with what's most comfortable., Many people believe that indulging in drugs or alcohol will help relieve stress. While the temporary euphoria associated with intoxication may feel relaxing in the moment, it can actually create far more problems than it's worth.Getting intoxicated instead of working through stressful situations can cause you to have trouble dealing with stress in the future. Over time it reduces your ability to successfully cope with your day-to-day stress.
Drinking or doing drugs to cope with stress can quickly lead to addiction and dependency.
In addition to addiction, drug and alcohol abuse can also lead to other health problems.
Rather than seeking a quick ""solution,"" it's best to learn how to cope with stress and find healthier ways to relax and calm down.

, One of the best lifestyle changes you can make to reduce stress and feel happier in general is to practice gratitude. Practicing gratitude does not mean ignoring your problems or pretending they don't exist. Instead, you work to change the way you approach day-to-day stress.Any time you find yourself feeling stressed, think about all the things in your life that you have to be grateful for.
Think about your family and friends, your health, the beauty of nature, and the personal experiences that helped you become the strong and talented individual you are today.

, In stressful situations, it may feel like the pressures of work will never let up. You may feel exhausted, anxious, or even angry, and in the moment it may seem like the problems you experienced that day are the most important thing in the world. However, it's important to step back and remember that most of the problems you experience on a day-to-day basis will be quickly forgotten about and won't have any lasting impact on your life.Ask yourself how important a given problem really is.
Consider whether that problem will matter in a day, a week, a month, or a year.
Any problems that won't impact your life beyond the short term are generally not worth worrying about. It's a waste of time and energy that could have been spent doing something calming and enjoyable.

Practice STOPP-ing.,
Watch out for personalization.,
Steer conversations away from upsetting topics.,
Avoid too much negativity.",How to Calm Down Quickly4," STOPP is a handy acronym to help you remember to keep your calm in a situation. It has five easy steps:Stop your immediate reaction. “Automatic thoughts” are habits of thinking that we’ve become accustomed to over our lives, but they’re often damaging. Stop what you’re doing and wait to react for a moment.

Take a breath. Use the deep breathing techniques in this article to take a few deep, calming breaths. You’ll think better afterward.

Observe what’s happening. Ask yourself what you’re thinking, what you’re focusing on, what you’re reacting to, and what sensations you’re experiencing in your body.

Pull back from the situation. Look at the bigger picture. Are your thoughts fact-based, or opinion? Is there another way to look at the situation? How do your reactions affect others? How would I want others to react here? How important is this, really?

Practice what works. Consider what the consequences of your actions are, for you and for others. What’s the best way to handle this? Choose what will be most helpful.

, One common distortion in our thinking habits is personalization, where we make ourselves responsible for things that are not our responsibility. This can lead to us feeling angry and upset, because we can’t control others’ actions. We can, however, control our responses.


For example, imagine that a coworker who often has anger issues yells at you for something. This is understandably upsetting. It’s not appropriate behavior. Now you have a choice: you can react automatically, or you can stop and think about what might really be going on.
An automatic reaction might be “Joe must really be angry with me. What did I do? I hate this!” While understandable, this reaction doesn’t really help you calm down.
A more helpful reaction could look like this: “Joe yelled me. That sucked, but I’m not the only person he yells at, and he flies off the handle pretty easily. He could be responding to something else in his life. Or he could just be an angry person. I don’t think I did anything wrong in this situation. His yelling isn’t fair, but it isn’t my problem.” These statements acknowledge that you feel upset, but focus on a way to avoid obsessing over it.
Note that watching out for personalization is not the same as accepting abuse. It would be perfectly appropriate to talk with your boss about Joe’s angry behavior. However, by reminding yourself that you can’t control others’ actions and they’re often not about you, you can learn to calm down more quickly.

, A sure-fire way to get the blood boiling is to talk about topics you feel strongly about with someone who feels equally strongly on the opposite side. If you feel able to have a productive discussion with someone, that’s fine. If the conversation feels like it’s two opposing monologues, try diverting the topic to something less incendiary.It can feel uncomfortable to suggest a change of topic, but the relief from the stress and tension is well worth the momentary awkwardness. Don’t be afraid to take charge and say something like, “You know, it looks like we may have to agree to disagree on this subject. How about we talk about that basketball game last night?”If the other person continues to talk about what’s upsetting you, excuse yourself from the conversation. You can use an “I” statement to avoid sounding blaming: “I’m feeling a little overwhelmed by this topic. You all can continue to discuss it, but I’m going to need to step away.”
If you truly can’t leave the situation, you can mentally retreat from the conversation. Visualize yourself in somewhere peaceful. This should only be used as a last resort, because it will usually become obvious that you aren’t really listening. That could offend or upset the other person., Exposure to too much negativity can actually cause problems in how you think, learn, and remember information.Constant exposure to negativity will encourage your brain to make a habit of negative thinking.While it’s common to have complaining sessions at work or school, be careful that these don’t become too frequent, or you might find yourself more upset than you expected.The problem is particularly bad if someone is complaining to you about something that also makes you feel wronged. You may become as upset as if the injury happened to you. However, you may not have any avenues to rectify the wrong, which can leave you upset and frustrated.
Like any other emotions, complaining and negativity are also contagious. Even 30 minutes of a stressor such as listening to someone complain can elevate your cortisol levels, a stress hormone that makes it harder to think calmlyTry to think about situations productively instead. It’s normal to feel frustrated when situations go badly. A momentary venting of feelings can be helpful. However, it’s more helpful in the long run to think about what you can change in a given situation to make it work better next time than it is to focus on how badly things already went wrong.

Locate a quiet place.,
Decide on a comfortable position.,
Control your breathing.,
Focus on something.,
Engage in prayer.,
Know that there is no “right way” to meditate.,
Enjoy yourself.",How to Meditate to Relieve Stress1," The world is a distracting place and this may not be an easy request. However, a quiet spot where you can meditate without interruption is valuable when learning to meditate to reduce stress. As you become more proficient with meditation, outside distractions will bother you less and less.


At first, many things will probably distract you. You will hear cars driving by, birds and people talking. It is best to turn off all electronic devices like cell phones and television to minimize things that could draw your attention away from your meditative task.
A room with a door you can close usually works well but you can also get earplugs if needed.
As you develop greater meditation skill, you will find that you can meditate anywhere—even in high-stress situations, such as traffic, work or crowded stores.;
, Meditation can be done lying down, walking, sitting or really any position. The key is to be comfortable so that discomfort does not distract you.


Some people may feel more connected in a traditional cross-legged position. This can be uncomfortable for beginners, though, so consider propping your bottom up on a pillow, sitting in a chair or using a wall to support your back., All meditation uses controlled breathing. Breathing deeply helps your body and mind relax. In fact, effective meditation can be practiced just by focusing on your breathing.


Breathe in through your nose and then out through your nose. You will want your mouth closed but relaxed while you breathe. Listen to the sound your breath makes.
Use the diaphragm muscle to expand your lungs. Put your hand on your stomach. It should rise as you inhale and lower as you exhale. Breathe in and breathe out at regular intervals.
Controlling your breath allows you to slow the rate of your breathing and fill your lungs with more oxygen per breath.
Taking deep breaths relaxes the muscles of your upper torso, such as those in the shoulder, neck and chest. Deep diaphragm breathing is more efficient than shallow breathing with your upper chest area.

, Paying attention to something or even nothing at all is an important component of effective meditation. The goal is to free your mind from distractions that cause stress so your body and mind will get a break. Some people choose to focus on an object, image, mantra or each breath but you can also focus on a blank screen or something else.


Your mind will probably wander during meditation. This is normal and to be expected—even for those who have been practicing meditation for a long time. When this happens, just bring your thoughts back to what you were focusing on when you started your meditation, whether it was an object, your breathing or a feeling. , Praying is a type of meditation practiced all over the world in many different religious and non-religious contexts. Adapt the prayer to meet your needs, personal beliefs and meditative goals.You can pray out loud, silently or write down your prayer. It can be in your own words or those of others.
Prayers can be devout or casual. Decide what best fits who you are, your belief systems and what you want the prayer to do. You can pray to a god, the universe, yourself or to nothing in particular. It is up to you.

, If you stress out about how you’re breathing, what you’re thinking (or not thinking) about or whether you’re meditating correctly, then you’re only adding to the problem. Meditation is adaptable to suit your lifestyle and the situation. It’s about taking a few moments to relax your way in a busy, stressful world.


It can be helpful to add meditation to your daily routine so you practice regularly. For example, you can choose to begin or end each day with a few minutes of meditation.
There are many different types of meditation techniques you can try. Experiment by trying various methods. Soon, you will find one that works for you that you really enjoy.Meditation centers and classes are probably available in your area. If you find that you work better in a group setting with trained guides, then consider attending a meditation at one of these places. You can usually get more information by searching for meditation and your location on the internet, looking in the newspaper or visiting your local meditation center or temple.

, While meditation can provide short and long-term benefits for you, it also should be a pleasant experience. Some resistance to clearing your mind and relaxing is normal when we are so used to being under a lot of stress but don’t force yourself to meditate a certain way if you don’t enjoy it.


The key is to find a sense of peace in the moment. Don’t ignore the opportunity to meditate while doing ordinary activities. Mundane tasks like washing dishes, folding laundry or fixing the truck are all opportunities to use relaxation methods, such as deep breathing, to meditate.
Don’t forget that creative, relaxing activities also work well to meditate. Listen to music, paint, read, garden, write in a journal, or watch a flame in the fireplace. These activities can focus your mind, decrease stress and alter brain waves into a meditative state.

Remember happy moments.,
Listen to calming music.,
Ground yourself in the present moment.,
Imagine calming scenarios.",How to Calm Down After Reading or Watching a Creepypasta1," After you finish reading Creepypasta, try to think happy thoughts. Distract yourself by recalling the happiest, most carefree moments in your life. Place your attention here instead of going over the scary stories in your mind.Think about moments when you were your happiest and having a lot of fun. Relive and reimagine fun moments in as much detail as possible. Close your eyes, for example, and remember the peaceful beach day you had with friends a few weeks ago. What did it smell like, sound like, feel like, and so on?
You can also think about lighthearted media, or even watch something lighthearted. What's a movie that always calms you down? When reeling from fear over Creepypasta, maybe you can remember moments from your favorite childhood movie. See if you can find clips from this movie on YouTube.;
, Make a playlist of your most calming songs. Choose things with a soothing beat and lots of calming instrumentals. Pick songs that are uplifting and have a happy message. Pop in your headphones and listen to this mix, making a point of focusing on the music. This can help distract you from the distressing stories.If you're experiencing the physical effects of fear, like a rapid heartbeat, music can help with this as well. Your body's rhythm naturally adapts to the sound of music. If you listen to a slow-paced song, your heartbeat may slow down and your breathing may return to normal.

, After reading or watching something scary, it's easy to let your mind wander. Instead of remaining calm, you may replay a frightening scenario over and over again in your mind. It can help to take in the present moment. Grounding yourself in the present can really help ease fears.Take in your surroundings. Notice how you're connected to your present surroundings.
For example, what are your feet doing? Pay attention to how they're touching the floor. Pay attention to how your back and buttocks feel in your chair. This will help keep you in the present and prevent you from indulging in scary thoughts.

, Think about something relaxing, even if it's something unrealistic. Imagine yourself floating on a soft, fluffy cloud. Picture yourself flying over your neighborhood. Let your imagination run wild.Your imagination can get the better of you after watching scary media. You may imagine running into a scary character from a Creepypasta, for example.
Instead of letting your imagination take you down a scary path, force it to think of something pleasant. You can even invent a happy story for yourself. Imagine yourself running into a pleasant fictional character instead of a dangerous one, for example.

Seek out guided meditation.,
Listen to brain wave entrainment.,
Focus with concentrative meditation.,
Practice mindfulness meditation.,
Practice a movement meditation.",How to Meditate to Relieve Stress2," Guided meditation can be very helpful for beginners because someone else leads you in your effort to relax and enter a meditative state. These are usually narrated through instruction, stories, imagery or music and can be accessed via a sound file (mp3, CD/DVD, ect.) on your computer, phone, tablet or by video.


Guided meditation uses the senses. You utilize smells, sights, sounds and textures to visualize various methods of relaxation. Often, you follow along as a guide offers directions on how to breathe, relax muscle groups and create a sensation of inner peace., There are many audio apps, CD/DVD and other forms of meditation available now that use binaural beats to facilitate deep meditation very quickly. These beats synchronize brain waves so that the frequencies are altered to help the mind reach various states of consciousness., Concentrative meditation has you focusing your attention on an image, object, sound or positive mantra. You can think of a peaceful beach, a bright apple or a calming word or phrase. The idea is that what you choose to focus on helps block out distracting thoughts.


For your mantra, repeat a word or phrase that calms you. You can choose something like “I feel at peace” or “I love myself” but really anything that makes you feel better will work. You can say it out loud or silently, whichever you prefer.It can be helpful to place a hand on your stomach so you can feel your breathing while you practice controlled breaths, visualizing or mantra repetition.
Consider Japa meditation. It utilizes the repetition of a Sanskrit term or word along with a beaded rosary to meditate. You may also want to try passage meditation, which uses spiritual or inspirational passages to focus and achieve meditation.

, Meditating this way focuses your attention on the present moment. You bring awareness to what is happening right now and your experience during meditation, such as your breathing. You recognize what you feel, think and what is happening around you without actively trying to change it.


While you meditate, observe the thoughts going through your head and what you feel but don’t judge or try to stop them. Let your thoughts and emotions pass on their own. Mindfulness meditation works because you are able to forget the past and the future. Stress results from thinking too much about things that are out of our control—things that already happened and things that may happen. With this type of meditation, you are able to stop worrying about everything.
You can bring your thoughts and feelings back to mindful meditation by focusing on the present moment. Pay attention to your body. Is your breathing deep and slow? Are your fingers touching? You don’t stop wandering thoughts or feelings--just think about what is happening now.Try practicing a loving kindness meditation. This is a deep desire for well-being and happiness for yourself. You focus on the feeling of love and well-being in the moment. Then you extend that feeling out to everyone else in the world.

, Yoga and T’ai Chi are well-known stress relief meditative practices that use movement and breathing to promote well-being. Research shows that they are effective ways to meditate and maintain health.Yoga uses different movements and a series of postures along with controlled breathing exercises to reduce stress and help you relax. The poses require balance and concentration so you are less able to think about stressors.
T’ai Chi is a Chinese martial arts that uses a gentle series of postures and movements to meditate. The movements are self-paced and done slowly in a graceful manner alongside controlled breathing.Walk and meditate. Slow down your pace and focus on your legs and feet. Observe what the movement feels like as you move your leg and your foot touches the ground. Note whatever sensations arise. If it helps, you can try silently repeating action words that have to do with walking—""lift"", ""move"", ""foot down"", ect.

Relax your body.,
Take your time.",How to Meditate to Relieve Stress3," It could be anywhere. Outside under a tree, in a bedroom with the lights off, or even in your living room. Anywhere that makes you feel comfortable is great. Make sure that there is no distractions in the area you have chosen and make sure there are no future distractions. You need to be focused on the here and now.

, Whether it would be sitting, laying down, or standing up the decision is up to you. Make sure that it's comfortable for you. Once you find your position, close your eyes.


If you are sitting up, you’ll want to have good posture so you can breathe better. Your back should be straight, chest slightly lifted and shoulders back. Lift your chin slightly but do not strain your neck. Your wrists should rest lightly on your knees, palms open and facing up.

, As you are in your position with your eyes closed, take in a slow, deep breath. As you are taking in your breath, relax yourself. Loosen your shoulder and neck, wiggle your toes or fingers. Breathe in slowly, and as you breathe out, imagine all your stress and worries leaving your body whenever you exhale.

, Put off any tasks that can wait until after you're done meditating. As you are taking in your breaths, let all your worries go. Stop stressing or thinking about commitments, appointments and responsibilities. Save that for later. Instead, become self-aware. Notice your breathing, your relaxation. Be in the moment and benefit from it.


Of course, if the phone rings, or you need to do any important task, then take care of it. You can always return to this meditation later.

, This may be from a holiday a few years ago, when you were younger, an imaginary place or you simply sitting alone in a park. The point is that you get a good feeling from the location.


Another option is to practice mindfulness meditation. Simply focus on what you are experiencing at the moment. Focus on your breathing, what you hear or smell right now. Bring your mind back to your breathing as often as possible.

, Keep your eyes closed, continue to breathe deeply and imagine all your body slowing down. Your heartbeat, your blood flow, all the way down to your feet—everything should begin to feel loose and heavy. Continue imagining yourself in your happy place while breathing slowly for the next few minutes.


Scan your body to find areas that feel tense from stress. Start with your toes and move all the way up to your scalp. Imagine that each deep breath flows into that body part as heat or light. Do this for 1 to 2 minutes and repeat for each tense area., Don't worry how long you should meditate for. Keep meditating until you feel yourself relaxed and refreshed. If you need a time frame, studies show that 5-15 minutes is beneficial. Once you feel like it's over, open your eyes and feel the benefits.

Accept your fears.,
Remind yourself the stories are imaginary.,
Laugh it off.,
Re-frame your thinking.",How to Calm Down After Reading or Watching a Creepypasta2," It may sound strange, but accepting your fears can help you get over them. If you try too hard to push fears out of your mind, this may backfire. Trying too hard not to think about something can make you think about it more.If you try to force yourself out of a fearful mood, this may create more anxiety. You may say something to yourself like, ""It's just a story. You need to grow up and relax."" If you find you don't relax, you may feel frustrated with yourself, leading to more stress and anxiety.
Instead, just acknowledge you're upset. Take a moment to accept the situation and deal with it from there. Think something like, ""I'm scared because I read a story about a ghost. Now, I'm jumping at small noises in my home. It's scary, but that's okay. I can watch something else to calm down.""

, While you know logically the stories are made up, when you're scared it's sometimes hard to remember this. Keep reminding yourself what you read is not real. While stories like Slender Man can seem compelling, they were made up by users on the Creepypasta website.Think to yourself, ""This story is imaginary. The characters cannot hurt me.""
Look at your fears from a rational perspective. In reality, you honestly have nothing to fear. The characters in the stories are not going to harm you, as they don't exist. Keep telling yourself this.

, Humor can help you confront your fears. Instead of pushing them away, which can backfire, you're facing your fears head on. Find a way to laugh at the Creepypastas you've read. You will find your anxiety lessens greatly if you laugh off the stories.Think about Slendy and Jeff going to ballet class, or smile dog getting his teeth whitened. Look at whatever story you've just read, and find a way to make it humorous. It can be something as simple as imagining a character doing something ridiculous or stupid.
You could also watch videos that make fun of Creepypasta. You can find these videos online. Google something like, ""Silly Creepypasta"" or watch people comically reading the stories and laughing.

, If you're having trouble calming down, it may be how you're looking at the situation. Instead of dwelling on your fear, examine it. Find a way to reassess the situation in a more positive light.For example, you're scared because you read a story about a murderer. You keep thinking about it, even though you don't want to.
Think of an explanation for your fear. Think about what you're really scared of. You're scared of danger, like most people.
Do not beat yourself up over this. Instead, think something like, ""It's good and healthy to be afraid of danger. Being watchful for danger can protect me. Even though I don't really need to be afraid right now, this could be a positive in the future.""

Slow your breathing.,
Tense and relax your muscles.,
Write down your thoughts.,
Get some exercise.",How to Calm Down After Reading or Watching a Creepypasta3," Simply being aware of your breath can help you calm down. After reading a Creepypasta, do some basic breathing exercises to ease your anxiety.Breathe in through your nose. Make sure to channel your breath so your stomach rises.
Then, exhale slowly through your mouth.
Repeat this 10 times. You should notice yourself becoming increasingly calm.

, Muscle relaxation is another simple way to ease tension. If you're having trouble unwinding, try tensing and releasing your muscles to ease anxiety.Move from your head to your toes. Tense muscles, like your shoulders, for a few seconds and then release them. Move downward, until you've reached your toes.
If you're stressed, your muscles naturally tense up. By consciously tensing them and releasing them, you're relieving yourself of some of the physical feelings of stress.

, If you can't get a Creepypasta out of your head, journal about your feelings. Pull out a notebook and pen and pencil and write. Purge your feelings about how and why the story scared you. Do a free write until you can't think of anything else to say. Jotting down your thoughts can help you get them out of your system.For example, you can start with something like, ""I'm so scared of the story I just read. It was about a woman who can talk to spirits, and it was just so disturbing.""
Continue venting your thoughts. For example, ""I don't really think spirits are real, and if they are they probably won't hurt me. But I'm still nervous, which is frustrating.""

, Exercise can reduce anxiety. If you're unable to relax after reading Creepypasta, do something physical. This can help ease your fears.Go for a walk or run.
Go for a bike ride.
Do some jumping jacks or light cardio in your living room.

Find a quiet place.,
Get comfortable.,
State your goals.,
Close your eyes.,
Emphasize your breathing.,
Focus your attention.",How to Meditate for Self Discovery1," Before you begin meditating, you will want to find a quiet place that is free of any distractions. Make sure that there is nothing in the room that might break your concentration. Turn off all electronic devices or leave them in another room.Try to avoid places with lots of people or that have heavy foot traffic.
If there is outside noise that you find distracting, consider playing some soft ambient music.;
, In order to facilitate your meditation, you will want to get as comfortable as you can. You should wear lose fitting clothes that breathe easily. Be sure to sit on a chair or cushion in a way that is comfortable for you. Although practitioners of meditation are often depicted sitting cross-legged, this is not an essential pose. However, you will want to sit in a way that facilitates your breathing, so be sure to keep your back straight.If you intend to make meditation a regular practice, you may want to consider purchasing a meditation pillow.
You may be interested in walking meditation. However, this is typically done by more advanced practitioners.Avoid lying down, which might cause you to fall asleep. With meditation, you want to be relaxed yet alert.

, Once you are in a comfortable position, state to yourself what you want out of your practice. If you are looking for self-discovery, say things like “I want to know myself better” or “find my strengths.” Stating your goals will give your practice purpose and help you better focus.


Try to make your goal a mantra. For example, “strength” or “knowledge” may be good mantras for self-discovery.

, After you state your goals, close your eyes. In your mind, check out how your body feels.Concentrate on and investigate any sensations that come along.Take some time and mentally move through your body, examining all its sensations.

, Take deep breaths in and out. You will want to fill your lungs with air and slowly release it. Concentrate on your breathing and the movement of your body.Try to breathe from your diaphragm. This will help you take in more oxygen and slow your breathing, helping you relax.

, Once you have started your breathing, continue to concentrate on each breath. Place all of your attention on your breathing. This frees your mind from the stress and anxiety that can cloud it.You might want to try repeating a mantra to help you focus. This is a word that you will repeat to help your focus and express your intention. For example, if you are trying to better understand yourself, try mantras like “truth,” “discovery” or “authentic.”
You may also find that looking at an image or stationary object helps your practice. Some people concentrate by looking at the flame of a candle.

Plan a few meditation sessions.,
Try meditating first thing in the morning.,
Default to short and consistent sessions.,
Set up reminders.,
Meditate before or after another habit.",How to Find Time for Daily Meditation1," Consistency is one of the most important factors in establishing a meditation routine. Of course, if you’re struggling to find time to meditate, a consistent meditation routine may seem like a lofty goal. By planning ahead, however, you can ensure you’ll get the chance to meditate, and may find that a particular time of day works especially well.Look at your plans for the next few days. Pick a few time slots where you’re open, and plan to meditate during these time slots, even if only for a few minutes.
If you know you’ll have a few free minutes at the same time every day, commit to meditating at the same time every day. Choosing a time will help you establish a routine.
Again, don’t worry too much about the length of time you have to mediate starting out. Even a few minutes will feel great once you establish a routine!;
, As soon as you wake up tomorrow morning, get up, use the restroom, and sit down somewhere to meditate. If you use an alarm to wake up, set it ten minutes earlier than you would have otherwise. Early morning meditation is optimal for several reasons. In particular, you are less likely to be distracted, and your meditation session will help you start the day off with clarity and energy.Don’t wake anyone else up when you rise. Wake loved ones after you’ve meditated.
Avoid checking your phone as soon as you wake up. It can wait ten minutes!

, As you’re trying to establish a routine, you may find that the time slots you set aside for meditation are sometimes shortened by your day to day responsibilities. It’s perfectly alright if you have less time than expected; the important thing is to stick with it. Maintaining a regular routine should take precedence to any concerns regarding the length of your meditation sessions. Even if you’ll only be able to meditate for a few minutes, do it!
A daily five-minute meditation session is better than a 30 minute session every three days, as you’re more likely to develop a successful routine by staying consistent!

, Scheduling meditation sessions will only help if you actually keep them! To help remember your commitment to meditate at a certain day and time, create an alert in an online calendar or your phone’s alarm clock.There are even a few popular apps that will help you get in the practice of meditating everyday. Check out Headspace, The Mindfulness App, and Insight Timer., Is there something you already do every day? Meditate before or after another daily habit – such as brushing your teeth – to build associations between the activities. This will help get you in the practice of performing these activities together regularly.For instance, meditate before – or even during – your daily exercise regimen. One great option is focusing on your steps while you run (ensuring you’re on a safe route, free of vehicles or other danger).

, Make sure you have plenty of room to move about chaotically, for at least an hour.

, Focus on exhaling as thoroughly as possible before inhaling. Try to make your breathing get faster and faster, but make sure you always breathe deeply into your lungs.

Make sure you have a safe place to walk.,
Decide how long you want to walk.,
Stand still.,
Start walking.,
Become aware of your feet.,
Keep returning to the walking.,
Return back to home/school/work whenever you feel ready.",How to Meditate and Calm Down1," While you can practice walking meditation any time you are walking anywhere (e.g. while walking to school or work), if you are new to the practice, it’s best to choose a place where you can walk without encountering traffic.It is important to be safe while walking. While this type of meditation is great for calming down and relaxing, you do have to remain aware of what you are doing and where you are walking. It is not meant to be a trance-like state.;
, You can walk for five minutes if that's all you have time for, but you can also walk for 30 minutes or an hour if you have the time, and are feeling particularly anxious and caught up in the daily grind.


Knowing how long you want to walk can be helpful in choosing a place to walk. If you know you’re only going to walk for five minutes, you can probably find a small park to walk through.
If you are feeling very upset about something you can also skip this step and just dive straight into walking. You can walk for as long as you feel like walking or until you feel that you’ve calmed down.

, Before you begin your walking meditation, start by standing still outside. Take a few deep breaths, and breathe as deeply as you can into your belly. Try to notice your breath and how it feels going into your body, and then how it feels as you exhale.After you take a few deep breaths, return to your normal breathing, but try to stay focused on your normal breathing.
Try to become aware of how your body is feeling. Notice any soreness you might have or any tension you are feeling.
Some also recommend setting an “intention” before each meditation session. If you are meditating to calm down, you could make this your intention. For example, while you are standing there breathing, think about exactly what it is that is upsetting you, but don’t think about what you are going to do about it. Say to yourself, “During this meditation, I want to calm myself.” You could also simply say to yourself, “Calm.”, Now that you have become more aware of your physical and emotional feelings, start walking. You don’t need to walk fast. Instead, just walk at a pace that feels comfortable for you.While you walk, try to stay focused on the physical sensations that you feel as you walk. For example, do you notice any pain in your knees? How do your feet feel as they touch the ground?
You will probably get distracted by something you notice while you are walking, or your mind will want to wander back to whatever upset you. Don’t get even more upset by beating yourself up about this. When you notice your thoughts have wandered, simply go back to focusing on how walking feels.

, As you walk, start to pay attention to how your feet feel. How do they feel as they touch the ground? How do the socks feel on your feet? Are your shoes tied tightly, or are they a bit loose?Once you have spent some time focusing on your feet, slowly start to move upwards. For example, move to your ankles. Think about the sensation of your ankle joints allowing your feet to flex and relax. Then continue to move slowly up your body stopping anywhere you notice tension.
When you notice tension in the body, focus on letting that tension go. Let the tension in your hips relax, and allow them to swing loosely. Visualize the tension leaving your body and floating away.

, Inevitably, especially if you are very stressed, you will find it difficult to remain focused on yourself. Don’t get upset about this as it is normal for most people. When you notice that your mind has wandered to something that has upset you or that has stressed you out just do your best to refocus your mind on the sensations of walking.Remember that meditation is a practice. This means that you aren’t meant to become the ultimate master of meditation in a month or even a year, but instead that you can practice meditating to become better at it. You will have some days where it is very easy to stay calm and focused, and some days you will find it nearly impossible.

, If you have set yourself a time limit, then return when your time is up. On the other hand, if you are walking until you feel more calm, return when you feel like you have calmed down enough.


Having a calm mind will allow you to deal with the problem with less anger, and may help you see solutions you weren’t able to see before.

Meditate every day at the same time.,
Find a clean, comfortable and airy space.,
Sit properly.,

Remember that meditation is not about control but practice.,

Trust the process.,
Take meditation beyond your sits.",How to Improve Your Meditation," We all lead very busy lives, and it can be hard to find a time to dedicate to taking care of ourselves. However, setting a routine will make it easier to commit to this practice.


The best times to meditate are generally right after waking up or just before going to bed. This is when you're less easily distracted by other activities. You can also meditate at other times of the day if these work better for you, as long as you commit to a schedule. In any case, make sure you set aside a time in which you feel calm and your attention is not driven to other things.;
, For example, you can reserve a special corner in your home for it. Even better, you can meditate in your garden if you have one. Whichever place you choose, make it become your regular space for meditation.Get a cushion, a mat or a chair that you really like and that you can use specifically for your practice.
Burn some incense, if you find it helpful. Aromas help many people concentrate and relax.

, Posture is extremely important in determining the outcome of your sit. This can vary based on the specific form of meditation you practice. Whether you are sitting on a chair or a cushion, push your shoulder back, keep your back straight and bring your chin to your chest a little so that you can extend the rear of your neck.


If you are sitting cross-legged, find a comfortable position that you can maintain throughout the practice. Put your hands on your lap, either with your palms up or in a position that feels comfortable for you.
Keep your body warm and relaxed; do not clench or tighten your muscles.

, When choosing a space, it is important that you don't usually perform other activities in it that might divert your attention. For example, a lounge with a TV can be a highly distracting space. Instead, a bedroom is a space where you are more naturally led to relax and focus on yourself.


People are by far the most likely form of distraction. If you meditate at home, choose a time when no one else is around. if you meditate in a park, opt for a secluded spot. It's okay to meditate in the presence of other people if they're also practicing some form of meditation.
Switch off your phone and other devices. You don't want to have to answer calls when you're in the middle of a sit. Put away anything else that might act as a distraction, such as books or food.
If you can't avoid some background noise, try to get used to it so that it no longer affects you after a while. It is impossible to find perfect silence; your mind needs to make the best of what you can get.

, According to a popular saying: ‘You are what you eat’. Eat light meals in order to prepare your body for a practice, and try to meditate away from larger meals if you can. The digestion process can take up most of your energies, which you would need for the practice.Avoid foods you might be particularly sensitive to: again, digestion issues can work as a distraction.
If you eat a lot of fried food, use too much oil or spices, you might feel restless while meditating. On the other hand, eating too much meat, canned food and food that has gone off can make you sleepy during your practice.

, At the start of your practice, have a gentle dialogue with your mind. Ask yourself what your purpose in life is. Talk to your mind sincerely as if it were a friend: you might not like everything about it, but by listening to your thoughts you will learn how it works and find a deeper connection with it.Ask yourself what you want to achieve through your practice, for example: ""Do I want to get to know myself better?"", or ""Do I want to develop new habits?"" Try to understand which thoughts can be helpful for your meditation and which are not., Take a deep breath, inhaling and exhaling with your nose and/or mouth. Regularity is very important to ease into relaxation and empty your mind of any unwanted interference.


Listen to the sound of your breath and focus on its flow: as you inhale, this goes from your nose and mouth to your chest and all the way to your lower stomach. Once this cycle is over, push the air out with a long exhale.
Breathe at your own pace. Just like meditation, breathing is about ‘letting go’. Hence, don't let the breathing become irregular or fainter as you go deeper into your meditation: keep up with your chosen rhythm.
When you get caught up in your thoughts, focusing on your breathing rather than on keeping them on a leash will help you concentrate.

, This could be just your breath, music, a given mantra or one you come up with. Listening to a monotonous sound while meditating will help you focus on your body rhythms and relax you more quickly.A mantra can be a single sound (o), a syllable (aum), a word (peace), a sentence (I am at peace). These are all useful to disconnect from all those undesired thoughts getting in the way of full relaxation.
You can choose to repeat a given mantra, for example the most popular ‘aum’, but you can also create your own. Coming up with your personal one will make you slide into a meditative state because you won't have to worry about whether you're pronouncing it right.Repeat the mantra throughout the entire time of your meditation. This will keep you going and make you feel refreshed.

, It is common for those who meditate to get lost in all sorts of thinking. For example, it is normal to go from having a clear mind one minute to thinking about the laundry you have to do after the practice. In this case, try not to control your mind too much. Allowing your thoughts to arise freely will help you understand how your mind functions.Remember that the need to control oneself can be just as powerful a distraction as anything else.

, If you wish to improve your practice, there must be something that prevents you from enjoying your sits to the fullest. Find out what the problem is in order to address it. By doing so, you'll be able to come up with a plan to get the most out of your your sits.


For example, your problem might be lack of motivation. In that case, you'll have to find motivation in your life to make the practice worthwhile. If your problem is distraction, you'll have to eliminate the source of distraction. If time never seems to be enough to save some time to meditate, you'll have to make some room in your daily schedule for your practice.
In many cases, the problem might simply be that, as a beginner, you're unsure of how to get the most out of your sits. If that is your case, working out a routine that works best for you will require some experimentation. You can try different mantras or positions and see which is the one that relaxes you the most.

, Everyone comes to meditation from a different background. You first need to ask yourself why you approached meditation in the first place and how you think this could improve your life. Having clear goals will help you define how to best use meditation to your advantage and perfect your skills.


Make a list of the aspects of your life on which meditation can have a positive impact. For example, if you stress out easily, mark ""stress"" as one of the things you want to fix through meditation.
Once you have this list, use it as a starting point around which you can design your practice. For example, if you want to use meditation as a way to free yourself from other people's judgment, start each session by clearing your mind from such worries and focusing on your own well-being.
If your issue with meditation is due to lack of motivation, having this list will give you enough reasons why meditation can help you. Use it each day to motivate yourself by taking a look at it before a session. After a while, you'll have internalized the motivation and you'll no longer need to remind yourself why you wanted to meditate in the first place.

, It's always good to get advice from someone who can expertly guide you through the process and give you personalized tips on what can work best for you. If you meditate as part of a group, try to replicate the same techniques when you're practicing on your own.It's always better to start meditating as part of a group. Guidance is necessary as a beginner. You can switch to meditating on your own when you feel confident you're familiar with the practice.

, Disbelief is by far the most powerful of all distractions. It's very hard to focus at all if you think the whole practice is useless. Have faith in your meditation techniques and in the fact that they will work. Take meditation as an ordinary procedure that helps you connect your body and mind and find a quicker way into relaxation.


As much as you trust in it, you shouldn't expect miracles from meditation. You might not be able to notice any change for a while during your practice.

, The teachings of meditation should be put in practice in your daily life. Meditation is about ‘discipline’, which has more to do with regularity than self-control. In order to achieve a better way of living, you have to train yourself and commit to it.Sticking to a routine in your day-to-day life is a way to extend your practice and turn your whole lifestyle into a longer form of meditation.
For example, get out of bed every morning right after you wake up. Do not allow yourself to get lazy. Give each day a purpose.

Be patient.,
Consider guided meditation.",How to Meditate for Self Discovery2," In order to strengthen your practice and continue on your journey of self-discovery, you will need to meditate regularly.

This will ensure that you are physically able to develop and grow in your meditation practice.Being disciplined about your diet and exercise may grant you knew discoveries about yourself.

, It is important to recognize that you will not immediately arrive at a point of self-awareness and discovery. It takes a lot of time and practice.

Meditate to break bad habits.",How to Find Time for Daily Meditation2," One of the best ways you can enhance your lunch break – and likely the rest of your day – is by meditating during lunch. Right before you eat, go somewhere you won’t be disturbed and meditate for five or ten minutes. Doing this just a few times can be especially routine-enhancing, as your brain will start to crave meditation as your belly starts gurgling for lunch., If you aren’t a morning person, there are plenty of other options that might be perfect for a daily meditation session. Try to get in the habit of meditating every day after work. For instance, if you have a commute, meditate outside before getting into your vehicle.Meditating as soon as you get home is another great option. Post-work meditation sessions may be especially beneficial, as they will help you shift gears from your work day to your life at home.

, Another good way to increase your familiarity and appreciate for meditation is by simply taking the opportunity to meditate whenever it comes up. If you’re having trouble deciding on a time and sticking to it, shoot to meditate for one minute at least five times in the course of a day.Set a timer for 60 seconds and close your eyes. Focus only on your breath, thinking of how it feels entering and leaving your mouth, your throat, your lungs. This alone will increase your calmness.
Points in your day where you could likely meditate for at least a minute include right when you wake up, right when you arrive at work (perhaps before entering the building), between completing tasks, and right before preparing or eating dinner.

, There are lots of opportunities to meditate that may be passing you by unnoticed. Next time you’re doing the dishes, in the shower, or hanging with a pet, meditate. Simply choose something to focus on. A great option is the way something feels, or the ways a repetitious or cyclical noise sounds. Think only about whatever you choose, pushing away any other thoughts that arise., Do you find yourself scrolling through your Instagram feed pretty often, perhaps even looking blankly at the same posts more than once? Whenever you catch yourself wasting time, immediately sit down to meditate.Many, many people fill the momentary pauses in their lives with further stimulation – often via their phones. Look to stop using your phone simply to kill time, and use that time to meditate instead!

Ensure an environment conducive to meditation.,
Focus on one thing.,
Observe your physical senses.,
Remind yourself that you are not your thoughts.,
Congratulate yourself.",How to Find Time for Daily Meditation3," One of the greatest benefits of meditation is the mental calm it can help you achieve. Of course, the world around you can make that more challenging. To help stay focused, meditate sitting up straight. This will prevent you from getting groggy.Avoid eating right before meditating. Digestion can also contribute to lethargy and mental fogginess.
Wear noise-canceling headphones if you find yourself distracted by noise. You may even want to listen to ambient sound or chanting.

, The classic thing to focus on while meditating is your own breath. Definitely try this if you haven’t before. Think about how the air feels as you inhale, and you lungs are replenished with oxygen. Acknowledge how it feels to exhale as well. If any thought unrelated to your breath arises, push it away.If you’re visually inclined, focus on the flame of a candle, or even a specific spot on a wall in front of you.
Another example is a mantra. Repeat a word or phrase over and over in your mind.
Don’t be frustrated when other thoughts arise. This is perfectly natural. Simply push them away without analyzing the thoughts and refocus.

, Your physical senses are another great source of simple information to focus on while mediating. For instance, ask yourself: “What can I feel with my skin?” There is likely air moving around you. Think only about this air and how it feels upon your skin.Similarly, ask yourself: “What am I hearing?” Phase out any peripheral noise and focus on one thing, such as a bird singing outside. Think only about the sound. If you start to think about the bird or the tree on which it sits, pull yourself back to the sound.

, Meditation is challenging, especially at first. It’s practically impossible to literally stop thinking. This is part of the reason meditation can seem so challenging. When you sit and try not to think, you become keenly away of all the mental static that’s constantly bombarding your mind!A busy mind is perfectly normal. Do not judge yourself when thoughts continue to break your concentration. In fact, take these intrusions as a sign that you will likely benefit greatly from meditating. Keep pushing thoughts away and refocusing on your meditation practice.

, There are as many ways to meditate as there are people who attempt it. Simply by attempting to meditate, you are. It’s impossible to fail! Even when a thought arises and breaks your focus – you notice it and recognize is for what it is: simply a thought. Stick with it, and you’ll soon be meditating regularly – not to mention recognizing the healthy, positive effects that increased mindfulness will have upon your life."

Find a peaceful place where you won’t be bothered.,
Set a timer.,
Find a comfortable sitting position.,
Set an intention.,
Rest your arms on your lap.,
Relax your gaze.,
Begin to notice your breathing.,
Return to your breathing.",How to Meditate and Calm Down2," You can meditate anywhere, but it will be easier to focus if you can find a quiet place where you will be left alone. You can meditate in your bedroom or even outside if you want to.Try to minimize distractions. Turn off the television, the computer, the stereo, and close the door to the room you are in to keep any pets from wandering in.

, This is not a requirement, but it can be helpful for allowing you to completely focus without wondering how long you’ve been meditating. Nearly all smartphones come with a timer, so you can just set it for however long you want to meditate, and start it once you’re ready to begin. Try choosing an alarm sound that isn't too jarring — try setting it to the sound of chimes or something melodic so you won't be shocked out of meditation when it goes off.


If you’re brand new to meditating, try to aim for a short time, maybe five minutes.
If you are very upset by something, meditating for a bit longer (say 10 minutes) may be very helpful in allowing you to center yourself.

, You can sit on the floor on a meditation cushion, you can sit in a chair with your feet flat on the floor. The important part is that you find a stable position to sit in.You will want to sit up straight while you meditate, so make sure that you will be able to comfortably do so in your chosen sitting position.

, This is not totally necessary, but it may be helpful if you want to calm down through meditation. Give yourself a few minutes to think about what is upsetting you without trying to solve the problem. Think about the emotions you are feeling. Then, think about what you hope to accomplish through meditation. For example, “I want to calm down so I can deal with this problem better.”


Your intention can even be a single word or phrase. For example, the intention of your meditation might be to calm down, so you could simply say to yourself, “Calm.” It can be helpful to say the word or phrase that is your intention aloud, but if you don’t want to, then just say it silently to yourself., You should try to rest your arms so that your upper arms are parallel with your body. You can rest your forearms on your lap with each arm resting gently on the legs.You don’t have to sit with your hands in any particular position (e.g. with palms facing upwards and index finger and thumb touching), just sit however feels most comfortable for you.

, You should allow your chin to gently drop just a little bit, and allow your gaze to rest on a point in front of you.You don’t need to stare at a fixed point, just let your gaze land wherever feels comfortable.
You can also close your eyes if that is most comfortable for you.

, Focusing on the breath is the biggest part of mindfulness meditation. All you have to do is focus on your breath going in and out. Is it cool going into your nostrils? Is one nostril more open than the other?You can focus more on the in-breath for awhile and then switch your focus to noticing the out-breath more for awhile. You can also focus on the whole pattern of breathing from start to finish if you like.
If you find that you absolutely cannot clear your mind, then incorporate your anger/worry/stress into your meditation. For example, imagine your anger leaving your body through each out-breath. Think of each in-breath entering your body and “cleaning up” all the anger, and carrying it away as it leaves your body.

, If your mind starts to wander (and it probably will), just simply take notice that you are now thinking about something else. Now that you have become aware, return to focusing on your breathing.The key is not to get angry with yourself. — if you start to get angry or frustrated, remind yourself that it's normal for your thoughts to wander. Make a conscious decision to stop your line of thinking and go back to focusing on the breaths as often as it occurs.
Keep going if you notice that you’ve been thinking about something that upset you for the last two minutes, simply go back to the breath.
You can also try visualizing your problems floating away as you become more calm or you can visualize yourself in a more positive state of mind. The point here is to find a way to make your meditation helpful to you. If you find that you are getting more frustrated because you can’t keep your mind clear, then switch your focus to something that feels helpful, such as visualizing your problems leaving your mind, for example.

Perform a mini breathing meditation.,
Do a relaxing breath exercise.,
Count your breath.",How to Manage Student Stress with Meditation2," Students have limited time. That means you may not be able to spend a long time meditating. However, you can do a short mini breathing meditation in just a few seconds. This meditation technique can be used anywhere at anytime.Take a moment to stop whatever you are doing. Either step aside or sit down somewhere.
Take a deep breath in through your nose. Hold it as you count to five. Exhale slowly. Repeat five times.
To make sure you are breathing correctly, look at your lower abs. Your lower abdomen should expand outward as you inhale and go down as you exhale.

, The relaxing breath exercise is a basic breathing meditation technique. You can take a moment to perfect this breathing technique anywhere.Start by sitting with your back straight. The tip of your tongue should be resting against the roof of your mouth right behind your teeth. Keep your tongue there, even when you exhale through your mouth past your tongue.
Exhale to get out any air. Then, close your mouth. Inhale slowly through your nose for a count of four. Hold the breath as you count to seven. Exhale completely through your mouth for a count of eight.
Repeat that three times. You should complete four breaths in all.

, Breath counting is slightly more difficult. For each cycle, you should only count to five. Don’t let yourself count beyond five. Each time you get to five, start back at one. Do this focused breathing meditation exercise for 10 minutes.Sit in a comfortable position. Make sure your back is straight and tilt your head forward slightly. Close your eyes and sit there for a moment breathing naturally.
Exhale and count to your head one. Inhale slowly, and when you exhale, make a mental count of two. Continue repeating this until you hit five.
When you hit five, start a new cycle. Exhale and count one. Repeat until you hit five.
Repeat for 10 minutes.

Get comfortable.,
Settle into the position.,
Be present.,
Breathe.,
Remain here for a few minutes.,
Come out of the meditation.",How to Manage Student Stress with Meditation3," To go through this mindfulness meditation exercise, you should get in a comfortable position. You can sit down and lie down somewhere comfortable, like a bed, comfortable chair, or a mat on the floor.Let your hands rest loosely by your side with the palms facing up or rest them on your torso. Remember, you should be comfortable.
Your body should not be tense. Make sure to soften any tense places on your body, like your shoulders or jaw.

, Mindfulness meditation focuses on the moment you are in. Settle onto the floor, letting your body relax. Feel all the places where your body connects with the surface beneath you.Be aware of the physical sensations of your body. Think about the temperature of your body and the air that touches your skin. Think about where your body touches the surface beneath you and the clothes you’re wearing.

, Focus only on the moment you are in. Do not focus on your stress or anxiety, forget about what you have to do for your classes. Don’t think about the past or the future. Focus only on this specific moment.Focus your mind on any thoughts or feelings you have in this moment. Try to keep your thoughts about this particular moment, not the past or present.
Don’t judge your feelings, thoughts, or physical sensations. One of the points of meditation is to become aware without being judgmental. Eliminate all criticism and negativity in your mind. Replace it with positivity. Be kind to yourself.

, Next, focus on your breathing. Breathe normally without trying to breathe some way you think you should. Let the breaths come naturally. Pay attention to how you breathe. Listen to the sounds your each inhale and exhale. Notice how the inhales and exhales feel physically.Think about how your chest and abdomen moves because of your breathing.
Remember not to judge. You are only observing. You are just breathing and being in the moment.

, Stay in this focused condition where you are thinking about the present and your breath for a few moments.Expand your sensations broader than yourself. Try to focus on any pleasant sensations, smells, sounds, or experiences around you.This expanded awareness can include the way your arms rest on the floor, the sound of your breath, the material of your shirt, or the sound of the music.

, After you have focused on your breath as long as you want, end the meditation. To do this, expand your mind to your body, then the room around you. Slowly, become aware of your surroundings. Slowly, open your eyes. Slowly move your body as you return to awareness."

Stress-relieving events are also good ways to get out of your dorm room or the library and socialize.
Some campuses may have a meditation group. The meditation group may meet weekly or monthly for a block of time.

Practice mindfulness of breath.,
View a body in various stages of decomposition.,
Prepare a lighter meditation, such as mindfulness of breathing, to help balance yourself after asubha meditation.,
Use the images of the body as a the object of meditation.,
Relate the image to your own body.,
Meditate on each stage of decomposition one after another.,
Steadily increase the time of your asubha meditation.,
Remember that the purpose of the meditation is not to engender hatred of the body but to help you gain a sense of detachment from it.,
Practice asubha meditation in moderation if you do not have a qualified teacher.,
Try to make a connection with an authentic teacher.,
Attend their lessons.,
Research different traditions.,
Be wary of cults and charlatans.",How to Do Asubha Meditation," This well help prepare you for the asubha meditation at hand and may help you reach the first jhana (or altered state of consciousness), when doing the asubha meditation.Initial meditation practice should include sustained attention on an object, such as your breath.If you feel your mind wandering during meditation, just bring your attention back to your breath without judgment and continue concentrating.;
, As these are not readily available in many countries, you may have to rely on photos or your imagination. In all, there are ten different stages of decomposition you need to see to prepare for the meditation.It is important that you see different stages, including the bloated corpse, a body that is blue/black, the festering body, a body with skin that is cracking, the mangled corpse, a body that has been cut up, a mutilated body, a bloody body, the worm-ridden corpse, and the skeleton. There are a few different versions of this sequence out there., Without the direct guidance of a teacher, this practice can be dangerous, as the canon of Buddhist literature includes a story of the Buddha teaching this mediation to pupils, a lot of whom commit suicide while the Buddha is in retreat., It is best to use the worst image you have seen for starting this meditation. This helps you get a sense of the corruptibility of the body., Think of the relationship between your body and that body. It is important to acknowledge your own corruptibility. You can do this by likening your body to the corpse you have seen., This will allow you to know the corruptibility of the body in all its forms, from bloated corpse to skeleton. This can help you reach the first jhana. If you have already reached the fourth jhana, it will simply help you learn to control the image, by focusing on a single aspect., Your goal should be to get to one or two hours of asubha meditation. The focus on the object for that time will allow you to go from thinking ‘learning sign’ or the pictures of the corpse as you saw them to the ‘counterpart sign’ or the perfected mental image., It is not so much to encourage you to live ascetically. Rather it is that you respect the body and its corruptibility. Focusing on foulness will lessen your attachment, but with practice it will also engender a healthy respect for your body., The practice can be very powerful, and can lead to hatred of the body without guidance. It is not surprising that such focus can lead to suicidal thoughts, but with guidance it can be an important meditation for your practice., This can be through email, or by seeing a photograph, or meeting in person. The important thing is that you connect. Don’t rush into a student-pupil relationship. The right relationship will become apparent with time., The best way to know if you have a connection is to listen to them teach. Going in person when you’re new to Buddhism can feel daunting, but all students start as beginners. If you can’t attend in person, listen to them online., There are major, as well as minor, differences between the different traditions of Buddhism that may help you toward a particular path. You may even want to ask for recommendations from someone you trust., Both of these will be harmful to your practice, and will likely you turn you off of Buddhism if they don’t manage to trap you whether through money or manipulation. Although there are many good teachers out there, it is important to do your research, and avoid such characters. If a teacher or group seems like they are too charismatic or too divisive, then you’ll want to avoid them."

Recuperate at home for the first 2 to 3 days after an acute back injury.,
Make an appointment with your doctor if you are experiencing shooting pains or numbness in your legs, hips or arms.,
Research potential osteopaths within the first month of your back injury.,
Check that the osteopath is licensed.,
Make an appointment and undergo an initial physical and evaluation with the osteopath.,
Start your treatments of osteopathic manipulation.,
Discuss your day-to-day activities with your osteopath, so that recommendations can be made for back-friendly changes.,
Try osteopathy for a few months to see if it is right for your condition.",How to Use Osteopathy to Treat Back Pain," Most people strain their muscles or tendons, which can be addressed with bed rest, slow walking, anti-inflammatories and ice for 72 hours. Begin to increase your exercise and gentle stretching after 3 days.;
, This could be a sign of nerve problems and damage. Your doctor is likely to recommend Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to properly diagnose the problem before a treatment is recommended.


People who are already experiencing chronic back pain should consult their regular doctor before getting osteopathic treatment, especially if they are using other methods of treatment, such as pain medication, epidural injections or physical therapy. Inform your doctor and seek recommendations before trying this alternative form of therapy.

, Osteopathy sites suggest it is most useful if treatment is sought within the first month. Read reviews online or get recommendations from friends before making your appointment.


A study conducted by WebMD and published by The New England Journal of Medicine found that people who suffered from a back injury recovered equally well if they used osteopathy or if they chose physical therapy and anti-inflammatories.

, Most European countries and all 50 states require an osteopath to pass an examination to be licensed. Check the credentials on a state or country licensure website or by calling up the osteopath's office.

, After reviewing your condition, the osteopath will recommend a plan to relieve your symptoms. Prepare for a series of weekly or monthly appointments that are usually recommended to treat back pain.

, There are a number of methods that are used.


A common procedure is called the high-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA) thrust. This is used to correct asymmetry in a facet joint. There is often a cracking sound associated with this movement. It is often considered the most uncomfortable portion of the appointment, but it rarely includes an increase in acute pain.
Another Osteopathic Manipulation Technique (OMT) is massage. The soft-tissue is manipulated with hands and pressure near the back muscles and facet joints. The osteopath often uses traction, where the head or feet are slightly lifted and pulled to relieve stress on the discs and nerves. This part of the appointment may be associated with a pleasant feeling in the muscles and back.
Counter force techniques are applied when the osteopath applies pressure against a muscle, in the hopes of helping it release. The patient is often asked to move their muscles against the pressure.

, Sometimes, the best pain relief is changing the way you stand, sit or lift. The osteopath may recommend daily changes in the following ways:


An osteopath will usually promote an active lifestyle. Similar to a general practitioner, an osteopath will recommend low-impact exercise, activity and weight-loss, if applicable. Diet change and weight loss can mean less stress on the muscles, discs and nerves in the back, relieving pain over time.
An osteopath will attempt to correct posture at most appointments. They will look to make sure that the spine is aligned from hips to shoulders to the neck. Changing your posture can be difficult, so make sure to think of it as your ""homework,"" and it may result in a back pain relief.
Discuss stress-management with your osteopath. Not all osteopathic methods are strictly medical. The practitioner may recommend stress-relief techniques like deep breathing, meditation, light yoga, relaxing baths and more, which can relieve muscle tension and relieve pain.

, Stop if you feel an increase in acute pain. You may feel a few days of muscle soreness after each appointment.

Choose a peaceful place.,
Take a few minutes to examine your thoughts.,
Choose a mantra.,
Take a few minutes to focus on the breathing.,
Take a deep breath before each time you say your mantra.,
Allow the mantra to fall in sync with your breathing pattern.,
Don’t think about the meaning of the words.,
Repeat for as long as desired.",How to Meditate and Calm Down3," When practicing mantra meditation it is not entirely necessary to practice in the traditional way (e.g. sitting down with eyes closed). If this is not possible, you can also practice mantra meditation wherever you are and whatever you’re doing.If you can spare a few minutes to sit quietly, try to do it in a peaceful place where you won’t be bothered.
For example, you could also try this type of meditation while washing the dishes, or while walking to school or work.

, Before you begin your meditation, it may be helpful to take one or two minutes to think about what has upset you. Think about the emotions you are feeling a bit more deeply. Are you feeling scared, sad, worried?


Realize that if you say you are “angry” that there is a more primary emotion underneath that. For example, if you think to yourself, “Oh, I am so angry because of that negative feedback I received on my work.” Think about the reason for your anger. For example, maybe you feel worried that you might lose your job, or you feel scared that you aren’t good enough.
If you feel that you have exhausted yourself by thinking of your problem, then skip this part. It is simply a way to help get your thoughts in order, but it is not necessary for a successful meditation.

, When using mantra meditation as a means to calm down, you can choose a word, phrase, or sound that helps you to relax. If possible, you should say your mantra out loud, but you can also say it internally to yourself.For example, your mantra could be, “Let it be,” “Take a step back,” or “It’s not the end of the world.” Remember that these are just examples, and that you can choose whatever helps you to become more calm.

, Before you begin chanting your mantra, just take a bit of time to center yourself. Take a few slow, deep breaths and notice how they feel going in and out. Allow your breath to return to normal and then continue to follow the breath for a bit longer.The purpose of this is to give yourself a more calm feeling.

, If you are saying the mantra out loud, take a deep breath in before you begin to say it. When you begin to say the mantra try to say it in one exhale.If you are saying the mantra internally, you can still practice this. To do this, take a deep breath in and then, as you breathe out, say it silently to yourself.

, Ideally, you will take a deep breath in, and as you breathe out, you will say your mantra. You can allow the last sounds of your mantra to linger if you are still breathing out.These are not hard and fast rules, but will help you get into a more meditative state.

, The word, sound, or phrase will take on a meaning of it’s own as you get into a rhythm of saying it. Instead, focus on your breath and the mantra as it flows with the breath.The point of meditation is to help your mind become more focused and relaxed. If you spend time analyzing the meaning of the words, your mind will not become relaxed.

, As with other types of meditation, you can set yourself a timer for a specific amount of time; however, if you just want to calm down, you could also repeat the mantra for as long as you need to begin to feel more calm.


Try to keep in mind that there are guidelines for meditation, but the purpose is to make you feel more calm and centered. If you stress yourself out about meditating “correctly” then you are defeating the purpose.

Learn how to tighten different muscle groups.,
Get ready.,
Tense your muscles.,
Relax your muscles.,
Repeat with the other muscle groups.",How to Stop Back Pain by Relaxing1," Progressive muscle relaxation works by focusing on tensing and then relaxing various muscle groups. In clinical studies, it's shown to be effective for some in alleviating back pain.Learn the different muscle groups, and how to tense and relax them, before engaging in PMR.


To tense and relax your lower body, focus first one foot, then your foot and calf, and then your entire leg. Begin by curling your toes, then pulling your toes towards you to tighten your calf, and then finally squeezing your thigh muscle.Then, you'll focus on your sides, tightening your left and right sides one at a time. Tighten your hand by clenching your fist and then tightening your biceps by bringing your forearm towards your shoulder.You should move then to the buttocks, stomach, chest, neck, and shoulders. You pull your buttocks together to tighten it, you suck your stomach in, and tighten your chest by taking a deep breath.Then, tighten the muscles on your face. Open your mouth wide, clench your eyelids shut tight, and raise your eyebrows as far as they can go.;
, Once you've familiarized yourself with how to tighten various muscle groups, prepare to engage in PMR. Find a quiet, comfortable place to sit that's free from outside distractions. Sit with your eyes closed. Remove your shoes and wear loose, comfortable clothing., The first thing you do when engaging in PMR is choose one muscle group to focus on. Tense these muscles as discussed earlier. For example, start with your lower body on the left side. Curl your toes toes on your left foot, then your tighten your calf, and then tense your entire left leg.


Hold the tension for about 5 seconds. It's important to squeeze hard and really feel the tension building. This may cause some discomfort or shaking.If you start to feel intense, shooting pain stop tensing your muscles and relax. While some discomfort is normal, you could end up hurting yourself if you feel pain and this may worsen back pain., Release all the tightness in the tensed muscle group. Notice the difference between tension and relaxation. Exhale and allow the muscles to become loose and limp. Focus on relaxing for 15 seconds before moving on to the next muscle group., Repeat the process with all other muscle groups. Continue to practice PMR twice a day until you get used to it. After that, you can practice it once a day or even only 3 or 4 times a week."

Watch for signs of stress.,
Get some exercise.,
Eat healthy snacks.,
Call a friend.,
Create a bedtime ritual.",How to Stay Relaxed1," The most effective way to stay relaxed is to prevent stress from accumulating. Unfortunately, the signs that you are experiencing stress can be subtle, and you may not realize it until it’s too late. So keep an eye out for stress-signals and take some steps to get relaxed. Take a few minutes each day to check in with yourself and looks for signs that you may be experiencing too much stress.Check your quality of sleep. Are you having a hard time falling asleep? Are you waking up several times during the night? Do you get plenty of sleep but still feel worn out?
How is your mental focus? Do you feel foggy? Is it hard for you to concentrate?
How are you eating? Have you been forgetting to eat regularly? Or perhaps you’ve been eating too much?
How are your interactions with others? Are you able to be patient, or are you irritable or snippy?;
, Physical movement of any kind is the quickest and easiest way to bust stress and stay relaxed. You don’t need to join a gym (although that is one option). You can take a walk around the block, put on some music and dance, or play in the pool with your family. You can use exercise to zap stress when it comes up, or you can make exercise part of your daily routine to keep stress away.Exercise doesn't have to be a major time commitment — it doesn't have to happen in a 30 minute or hour block of time. Squeezing in a 10 minute walk during your lunch break and then another one during your child's soccer practice may be more feasible and just as beneficial.

, Diet plays a major role in the ways that our bodies handle stress. When we are stressed, it is natural to reach for sugary or high-carb options to get a quick boost. But foods high in processed sugars and carbohydrate will actually spike your blood sugar, making you feel jittery, and even less relaxed. Instead reach for fruit high in vitamin C to help stabilize your mood, or dark chocolate to help reduce cortisol (the stress hormone)., Any time you need to let off a bit of steam, it is a great idea to call a friend and talk. Even if you don’t feel like talking about what’s bothering you, just some friendly chit-chat is an excellent stress reducer. Feeling a connection to someone produces the happiness hormone oxytocin, so calling a friend is an effective way to process stressful emotions., A good night’s sleep is one of best antidotes to stress, and a great way to stay relaxed. Unfortunately, bedtime can be the moment when all the day’s anxieties come rushing back to you. You can prevent this cycle and ensure restful sleep by creating a bedtime ritual that you do each nightPut on some gentle music while you get ready for bed (using the same song each night is a good idea).
Put on your pjs, brush your teeth, and wash your face.
Get a drink of water.
Do this ritual the same way each night. Within a week, you should experience deeper sleep.

Learn different bodily sensations.,
Prepare.,
Choose a position.,
Focus on different sensations in your body.",How to Stop Back Pain by Relaxing2," Autogenic relaxation has shown to improve symptoms of back pain for some patients.Autogenic relaxation is somewhat similar to PMR in that you pay attention to different sections of the body. In autogenic relaxation, however, you're more focused on different bodily sensation than tensing or relaxing different muscle groups. Learn about the different sensations you should focus on before attempting autogenic relaxation.Heaviness - Does your body feel weighted down in certain areas? Light in others?
Warmth - Are certain areas of your body warmer or colder than others?
Heartbeat - Pay attention to the beating of your heart. Try to stay in tune to the rhythm.
Breathing - Allow yourself to breath naturally and take stock of your normal rate of inhaling and exhaling., To prepare for Autogenic training, find an area of your house with few outside distractions. Choose a comfortable place to sit or lie down. Wear loose-fitting clothing., There are three different positions you can use to practice autogenic relaxation. Select one of the following:


Choose an arm chair that supports your arms and hands. Tilt your head back.Sit in a stool with your body slumped forward slightly. Rest your arms on your thighs and place your hands between your knees.Lie down with your legs eight inches apart, toes pointed forward, and your arms resting on your sides without touching your body., Once you're chosen a position, autogenic relaxation takes about 8 minutes. Move from one section of the body to the next. Many people find it easiest to move from their head to the feet or vice versa. Focus on the sensations in various body points. Do you feel warm, cold, heavy, relaxed? Focus on your heartbeat and breathing as you move through your chest. Pay attention to the cooling and warming sensations of your head and abdomen. Once you're finished, take a few slow, deep relaxing breaths."
"
Get to know your anger.,
Stop and breathe.,
Loosen your muscles.,
View “cursing” as a red flag.,
See the humanity in others.,
Imagine an asteroid is hurtling toward Earth.",How to Stay Relaxed2," Our brains are hardwired for survival. Part of that survival means protecting our emotions. As a result, we become addicted to negative emotional responses (anger, blaming, irritation). But the truth is, every little discomfort is not a threat to our survival. When you begin to recognize anger, you can begin to break the negative pattern.Notice the feelings in your body when you become agitated. It usually begins with a tightness in the stomach.
Next comes the blaming. You may find yourself saying, “How could they…” or “I can’t believe they would do this to me.”
When you feel this or hear these thoughts, stop and remember that this is survival tactic. Do you feel like you need to be angry right now in order to “survive”? If not, then you can break the habit.

, Perhaps the most ancient and sure-fire way to stay calm and help diffuse a moment of conflict is to simply stop and breathe. If someone makes you angry or defensive, do not immediately respond. Instead, stop, breathe, and count to ten (inhale on one, exhale on two, and so on). Just five breaths is usually enough for you to get your bearings and respond from a relaxed place, instead of firing off an angry or defensive retort., Scan your body for places that are tight. If you are in the midst of a heated discussion, aim to release tension stored in your body. By doing so, you improve your circulation, make it easier to think clearly, and increase your ability to stay calm.Quickly scan your body. Is there anywhere that you are holding tension?
Common locations for stored tension include the jaw, shoulders, and abdomen.
Take a deep breath in, and when you exhale, focus on releasing the tension from one area of the body.
Then repeat, releasing the tension from another spot.

, Sometimes letting an exclamation slip out can act as a kind of release valve. Rather than preventing yourself from cursing, the important thing is to view this outburst as a “red flag,” or a sign that you’ve reached a critical level of frustration. Whenever you become upset enough to curse, immediately stop and relax.Try the “stop and breathe” technique.
Perform a body scan and release tension.
Walk a way for a moment to compose yourself.

, Very often, we lose our cool dealing with people in a consumer capacity. We may become angry at the customer service representative, or the waitress, or the manager of a grocery store. In these situations, it is easy to focus solely on what it is you want, and fail to see the humanity in the person you are dealing with. In these moments, remind yourself that you are talking to a person with a family and a life, who is probably just doing his job.Remind yourself that the person you are dealing with has parents, and possibly children of his own.
Remind yourself that the person you are dealing with has his own daily struggles.
Remind yourself that this person eat breakfast, pays bills, and hugs his loved ones, just like you.

, When faced with a moment of intense stress or conflict, stop and imagine an asteroid is hurtling toward Earth. If this were your last hour on the planet, would winning this argument be important at all? The truth is, none of us know how much longer we have to be alive. Calling this to mind can enable you to be relaxed, let minor things go, and be your most positive self."

Change your attitude toward “discomfort.” Pain and discomfort serve important purposes in life.,
Exercise your patience.,
Chew your food.,
Focus on the journey.",How to Stay Relaxed3," Unfortunately, most people will do anything they can to alleviate discomfort rather than truly experience it. When you feel emotional pain or when you are inconvenienced, don’t look for the easiest solution. Take some time to consider the best possible solution. In some cases, that may just mean giving a situation some time.For instance, if you are in a new relationship and you get in an argument, your instinct may be to run, because you feel uncomfortable or experience emotional pain. Ending things might seem like the easiest solution and the best way to protect yourself from further discomfort, but in doing so, you miss out on the opportunity to grow, learn, and stay in a potentially rewarding and wonderful relationship. Remember that growing can be painful, but it's usually worth it.

, Patience is like a muscle: the more you use it the stronger it gets. You can put yourself in positions to strengthen your attitude toward patience. Try to do something like this everyday.Get in the longest line at the bank.
Go inside a restaurant instead of using the drive-thru.
Park in the last row when you go to the grocery store.

, Impatience is often expressed by the way we eat. Impatient people tend to rapidly gobble down their food, while relaxed folks take their time. You can work to cultivate patience by taking the time to chew your food. It will take a bit of discipline at first, but in time, you will stoke your ability to remain relaxed and at the same time, improve your digestion., When you focus only on some future goal, it robs you of the ability to enjoy what’s happening in the present. A person with a future-oriented mindset has trouble being relaxed. The worst part is, the future never really arrives, so you end up spending your whole life in an anxious state. Instead, focus on the journey and enjoy the ride.Stop to notice details during your day.
Name five or more features about what is happening in the present moment.
You may notice, for example, that the sky is a deep blue with a few clouds, a Tom Petty song is playing, or your dog is splashing in water and looks so happy.

Make a list of activities you want to do.,
Sleep in, if you like.,
Eat your favorite foods.,
Do your favorite activities, alone or with your loved ones.,
Go to bed early.",How to Spoil Yourself1," To make sure you spend your special day doing all the fun stuff you like to do, make a list. Just once, forget about chores or obligations for the day. Write down all the activities that brighten your mood. You may even add some interesting activities you have wanted to try.


Plan your special day on a national holiday, on a weekend, or you can use a vacation day to spoil yourself.;
, If you typically have to rise early, treat yourself by having a lie-in. Set your alarm for a little later than usual. Don’t stress about it—it’s your day, remember? Once you wake, don’t feel rushed to take on the day. You can bring a book or magazine back to bed, cuddle with your partner or pet, or simply just enjoy the comfort of the sheets., Think about the yummy foods you have been craving. Choose one or two delicious meals to cook for yourself or order out. Only cook if you actually like cooking. Otherwise, that falls under the chore category, and you’re skipping those for the day.In addition to your basic breakfast, lunch, and dinner, choose tasty snacks or desserts that you like.
Try to keep it balanced. You’ll be low on energy and unable to enjoy your day, if you only eat fried or sugary processed foods.

, Take your list of activities and start moving down the list. You can do these activities on your own, or you can ask a buddy to join you. Keep in mind that others may try to influence your plans, so if you really want to spoil yourself, go solo. This day is supposed to be about you.


You might see a movie at a local theatre, go for a swim, feed the ducks at the pond, ride your bike, or binge-watch your favorite TV show.

, After a long, satisfying day doing all your favorite activities, you should probably turn in early. That way, you’ll wake energized and ready to take on your usual responsibilities. Plus, getting seven to nine hours of sleep will ensure that you have a positive mood.Close the drapes, dim the lights, and lower the temperature so that you can sleep more comfortably.

Choose a suitable container.,
Fill the jar or bottle with water.,
Pour in the glitter glue.,
Add a few drops of food coloring.,
Shake in a little extra glitter.,
Glue the lid into place.,
Make jars in an assortment of colors.,
Add fun glitter shapes.,
Try out different containers.,
Hold the jar in both hands and shake.,
Watch the glitter swirl until it settles.,
Help your child work through their emotions.",How to Make a Calm Down Jar," For your calm down jar, you can start with any safe, transparent container. Plastic containers will be your best bet, as they’re less likely to break and cause accidents. The container you go with should have a solid one-piece lid or cap that screws on and stays put.Mason jars are a good place to start if you have older children that you trust to handle glass.
Clear plastic containers are safer and better choices for younger individuals. A quick look through recycling can often yield good results.
Many crafters recommend Voss or SmartWater bottles for their large size and smooth, sturdy construction.;
, Turn on the tap and run warm water into the jar until it’s about three quarters of the way full. From here, you’ll add each of the other components individually. Together, they’ll form a suspension in the water.Warm water will help melt the glue, resulting in a smoother suspension with no noticeable globs or separation.
Leave an inch or two of space at the top of the container so that the glitter mixture has room to move when shaken., Stir the glue to distribute it throughout the water and break up any clumps. For larger containers, use 1-2 small tubes of glitter glue. For small calm down jars, a single tube will likely do the trick.Use a toothpick or cotton swab to assist in scraping the glue out of the slender tubes.

, Swish the jar gently to help the food coloring diffuse throughout the water-glue mixture. The amount you use is largely up to you. Less food coloring will give the jar a bright, translucent look, whereas denser color will produce a mesmerizing galactic swirl.Stir in the food coloring gradually until you reach the desired shade.
Be careful not to add too much color. This will darken the contents of the jar and make it difficult to see the glitter., Grab an additional tube of extra-fine glitter and funnel it into the opening of the jar. The glitter is the main attraction of the calm down jar and should be pretty concentrated, so don’t be afraid to use a lot. You and your child can decide when your calm down jar has just the right level of shimmer.The more glitter you use, the longer it will take to settle.
Play around with different proportions of ingredients to change the speed of the jar., Now that all the necessary components are in place, top off the jar the rest of the way with water, leaving about half an inch of space at the top. Dab the underside of the lid with a strong adhesive, like super glue or rubber cement. Twist it firmly into place over the opening of the jar or bottle. Allow several minutes for the adhesive to take hold.This will keep the lid securely attached to the jar so that there’s no risk of it being pried off by small children or coming dislodged if it’s dropped.
Be careful when handling strong adhesives. Since there will be glitter everywhere, there’s a lot of potential to make a mess.

, Don’t stop at just one calm down jar—create as many as you please! Pick out a few bold complementary colors, or fill each of the jars with a different color and create a rainbow display. Letting your child gaze at their favorite color will only enhance the calming effect of the jar.Make enough calm down jars for every child in the household to have their own. This will help prevent stressful arguments over what belongs to who.
Soft colors like blue, pink, green, and lavender are especially soothing., Purchase a special craft glitter to mix in with the regular glitter and glitter glue. When you shake the jar, you’ll be able to see smiley faces, stars and dinosaurs floating around inside. This is a great way to add a more personal touch to the jar and encourage your child’s creative interests.Check craft supply stores for unique and interesting types of glitter.

, In addition to ordinary jars and bottles, look for other items that might make good calm down jar. An unused sunscreen or condiment bottle can be cleaned out and turned into a perfect travel-sized calm down jar. You could also make an oversized version using a repurposed peanut or pickle jar that all the little ones can gather around at once.Make sure the container you select is clear, can be gripped easily and won’t shatter if it’s dropped or thrown.Fill a keychain bottle of hand sanitizer with glitter to give your kids something to play with while you’re grocery shopping.

, Vigorously shaking the jar will give your child a physical outlet to blow off steam while they’re still worked up. They can jostle it as hard as they want for as long as they want until their frustration begins to subside. When shaken, the liquid inside the jar will shift, causing the glitter to dance in a brilliant cascade.Demonstrate how the jar works and explain that it’s supposed to make you feel better when you’re unhappy.Make sure small children can safely hold and shake the jar themselves. If not, you can get it started for them.

, After shaking the jar, your child can sit and marvel at the movement within, which will soon become slow and serene. Observing the shimmering liquid can be quite enthralling. With their attention on the jar, they’ll forget about what it was that upset them in the first place.It will take a few minutes for the glitter to completely settle, during which time your child’s mind and heart rate will stop racing.

, Have your child sit or lie down while they’re focused on the jar. If they’re still anxious or irritable, get them to concentrate on taking deep, relaxing breaths. Before long, they’ll find their mood settling along with the glitter.Calm down jars work because they subconsciously mirror your child’s emotional state. They’ll be responding to the behavior of the jar without even being aware of it.
Encourage them to keep the calm down jar in their room or take it with them to a quiet place where they can have a few minutes alone to cool off.

Slow down your breathing.,
Engage your body at your workstation.,
Raise your heart rate.",How to Calm Down at Work1," Deep, measured breathing can calm your mind and your body considerably.

, Nothing says “I’m special!” like a new outfit. You know the one you’ve been eyeing at the shop each time you visit but, you refuse to buy it because of the price tag or because you don’t have anywhere to wear it. Go to the store and make the purchase. Then, instead of waiting for a special occasion, make one of your own.

Take a couple normal breaths, then repeat the diaphragm breathing until you feel less anxious.Diaphragm breathing makes sure that your breaths are getting air all the way to the bottom of your lungs. This can be especially helpful when you feel like breathing is hard or you can't get a full breath (usually when you're anxious, angry, or stressed).


Controlled breathing patterns can signal your body that it needs to calm down. It does this by releasing neurotransmitters that calm you.;
, Mindfulness can be used to gently quiet the mind by bringing your attention to your sensations and surroundings. Start focusing on sounds, the temperature, what you smell or feel, and your breathing. Focus on these things until you start to relax.This can quiet your mind and research shows that it can reduce stress, lower blood pressure, and help with chronic pain.This can help you have more emotional control and awareness.The body physically responds to strong emotions by making you feel out of control. It secretes adrenaline which is released into your bloodstream. Adrenaline increases your heart rate, muscle strength, and blood pressure,which is your body's way of preparing for a ""fight or flight” response., Start by tightening and releasing the muscle groups in order from your head to your toes. Begin by focusing on your facial muscles, tightening them for 6 seconds and then letting the muscles release for 6 seconds.

You could even just write down phrases or words, if it helps calm you down. It's the process of thinking and recording your conflicts that is most important.Keeping a journal can also keep you from dwelling on things that bother you. Once you've written down the issue and your feelings, you can begin moving on., Cultivating a happy attitude can help you remember the good times and let go of things that you cannot control. Once you realize you can't control every situation, you can focus on managing your own emotions. This can help you take a step back and calm down.

Be consistent with this and eventually, you'll see most situations in a positive light., While this may be different for each person, know where to head when you start feeling overwhelmed. For example, you may want to escape to nature. Spend time watching or soaking in water and let it calm your mood.Or, maybe you'd feel more relaxed by surrounding yourself with people who respect and support you. Avoid spending too much time with people who get you worked up.


If you can, avoid stressful situations. For example, if you know that large social functions cause you anxiety, consider only going for a short while or just meeting up with friends on a smaller scale., If you've tried adjusting calming your body and your mind, without seeing any change, you may want to get professional help.

Improve shoulder motion.,
Lift weights to build muscle.,
Pick up small objects.,
Exercise your hands with a rubber band.",How to Use Physical Therapy to Recover From a Stroke2," At least three times a day, move your arms through their full range of motion. Arm exercises will help your balance when you are walking as well as your ability to pick up and lift objects again.


First, stretch out your affected arm until you can feel a slight burn. Hold it for 60 seconds (or as long as you are physically able) before relaxing.
Make a wide circle with your arms. Go slowly, and try to reach out as far and high as you are able.Raise your arms above your head before lowering them. Repeat this motion at least five times.

Keep something you like to look at within sight.,
Try vocal toning.,
Listen to something you enjoy.,
Smell, touch, or taste something enjoyable.",How to Calm Down at Work2," A photo of a loved one or a favorite personal memento are the best examples. Keep such an item somewhere you can glance at it whenever you wish to do so. A vase of flowers on your desk is another good example.If there’s nothing in your immediate vicinity to look at, imagine a place or person you enjoy and picture them in your head. This type of simple mental imaging can help calm you down.

, Vocal toning is a practice that can reduce the amount of stress hormones in your system. It is similar to making the “ohm” sound that is popular with yoga practitioners. Find somewhere private and quiet to try it out.Sit up straight and make an “mmmm” sound while keeping your lips together and your teeth a bit apart.
Though this may seem silly at first, the breathing and the vibrations that this leads to can cause pleasant sensations in your face, heart, and stomach.

, If you’re generally on edge or otherwise anxious at work, a bit of soothing background noise can help calm you down. Singing or humming along with a tune can be especially effective, but so can simply listening to music you enjoy.Soundtracks of nature noise(s) can also be reliably soothing. You can find all sorts of recordings of waves, wind, and birds online.

Find a solution.,
Talk it out with a sympathetic party.,
Reassure yourself verbally.,
Write down the reason you are upset.,
Re-frame frustrating scenarios in a way that amuses you.,
Work smarter, not harder.,
Fake calmness.,
Seek professional help.",How to Calm Down at Work3," Frustration usually happens when you feel that you are not able to get what you want out of a situation. At work, that might mean not getting the lead on a project or not getting timely emails back from your coworker. Remind yourself that there is a solution to every problem. Staying passive in the situation will only cause you more stress and frustration down the road, so take steps to identify a solution for your issues.

Focus only on what you can control. For example, you cannot change someone, but you can change how you react to them.
Make a list of your frustrations and brainstorm ways to work around them.
Without complaining about your personal issues or gossiping, ask a seasoned coworker or mentor for advice on how they would approach the issues you're having. Be careful not to talk inappropriately about other people at your workplace.

, In addition to mindful breathing, talking to someone is a great way to calm down. Face-to-face interaction with someone else that is relaxed is especially helpful, particularly when it is someone you trust.You can also incorporate some morale-boosting games and incentives to help you and your coworkers be more relaxed at work and feel better about yourselves and the situation. This could also help you build a better bond with your coworkers.


Meanwhile, good communication with your professional peers is vital. If you and another co-worker are consistently frustrated with one another, set up a time to speak with them. Having access to a support system with your colleagues will help you learn better ways to cope with your underlying issues at work. Say something like, ""Hey, Sarah, let's sit down sometime soon and chat to make sure we're on the same page about our upcoming project.""
Be careful of venting. Talking about the frustrations and problems to someone else in the office can relieve negative feelings. It can be useful. However, venting to a co-worker may blow up if your boss overhears you or someone hears you complaining. Also, simply venting is not helpful if it is not followed up by action to actually address the problem.

, Whatever the cause of your distress, it can be helpful to remind yourself that the world isn’t ending. Thinking to yourself, “This is only temporary,” can be a surprisingly effective way to calm down. Even better, state this phrase or something like it to yourself out loud.Your thoughts as well as your words affect both the way you feel, as well as how you behave. Reassuring yourself can not only calm you down, it can help you get in a better mindset to proceed with your day.
Other simple reassuring statements that might work include, “I’m okay,” and “This is going to work out.”

, Forcing yourself to address the specific reason you are upset can help you calm down. The best way to try to figure out exactly what’s bothering you is trying to write it down.Not only is the act of writing itself calming, getting your thoughts and feelings out on paper can help clarify an issue you're having.
Writing down your thoughts can even help you determine the best way to address the source or your frustration or anxiety and move forward.

, You may be able to laugh at yourself by stepping back and reassessing stressful or frustrating experiences. To increase your ability to do so, come up with a way to head-off potential frustrations by contextualizing them humorously.One particular option: make a Bingo card that includes all of the things about work that frustrate you from time to time. Next time any of those things happen, you may wind up chuckling while you mark your Bingo card instead of getting worked up.

, Set priorities and better manage your time so that you don't feel the pressure to scramble in order to get your work done. Procrastination can add a lot of stress in the workplace, but keeping yourself on-track to complete your projects on time can remove that stressor. Managing your time well will also help you feel more productive, which will give you a sense of satisfaction with your work.

Put your tasks in order based on priority.
Break up large tasks to make them more manageable.
Get tasks out of the way early if doing so can help relieve some of your stress.

, Though this one may be a bit challenging, it’s worth noting that it can actually work. Focus on controlling your emotions and acting as though you are not upset. Your mindset will sometimes shift to match the way you’re acting., If you consistently struggle with stress, frustration, or anger, it’s worth speaking with a mental health professional. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with seeking assistance handling your emotions, and you’re likely to wind up more calm, more content, and even more productive at work.Call your doctor for a recommendation about mental health professionals in your area.
Alternatively, look online for forums or in-person support groups about work place frustrations. There are likely other people experiencing the same sort of struggles, and you may be able to support one another and exchange advice.

Get enough sleep.",How to Remove All Tension from Your Body2," Meditation practices are traditionally buddhist techniques that can help develop concentration, clarity, emotional positivity, and a calm acceptance of the true nature of things.Do about 15-30 minutes of centering meditation (such as mindfulness or kindness and compassion meditation) daily to relax your muscles, relieve your stress, and as a result, remove the tension from your body.Try either kneeling, laying down on your back, or sitting with your legs crossed in front of you while you meditate. There are many different ways you can position your hands while meditating, and each are thought to have different effects on the body. Some of these so-called mudras include:

Surya, Breathing exercises can help to calm down an anxious or stressed mind and are particularly useful for releasing tension to enable sleep.

Try the 4-7-8 exercise by pressing your tongue against the back of your teeth, inhaling for 4 seconds, holding your breath for 7 seconds, and exhaling for 8. Then, repeat this 3 more times.Try alternate nostril breathing by sitting with your back straight and closing your eyes. Close your left nostril with your right ring finger and inhale. Then, close off your right nostril with your thumb as you exhale.Make sure to take deep belly breaths when you practice yoga. This will naturally invigorate you and help dissolve tension and tightness in your muscles., Stress is one of the most significant sources of tension. Avoiding stressful situations whenever possible will also help ensure that you don’t have tension in your body.Organizing your day and allowing time to relax will help you relieve and avoid unnecessary stress.Step back from any stressful situation if you can.

Make it a priority to get 7-9 hours of sleep every night to help you avoid stress and tension.Increased stress and tension are one of the negative consequences of insufficient sleep. Make sure you get enough sleep every night so that you don’t exacerbate any stress or tension in your body.Short naps of 20-30 minutes can also help relieve stress."

Learn to be aware of cognitive distortions.,
Understand Common Types of Cognitive Distortions.,
Identify ""all or nothing"" ways of thinking.,
Take a deep breath before responding.,
Identify patterns in your overreactions.,
Get some perspective.,
Retrain your brain.,
See a professional.",How to Avoid Overreacting1," Cognitive distortions are automatic thinking patterns that cause the person to distort reality. For people who have overreactions, it is typically because of negative or highly self-critical judgement that make a person feel negatively about his or herself. Unless a person learns to recognize a cognitive distortion, he or she will continue to react in a way that does not reflect reality. Everything gets blown out of proportion, often leading to over-reaction. These are typically formed in childhood. Having an authority figure (such as a parent or teacher) with a high level of perfectionism, or is overly critical, or with unrealistic expectations can easily lead to this.
""Don't believe everything you think!"" Becoming more aware of patterns of cognitive distortion allows you to make other choices in how to react. Just because you think something, does not automatically mean you have to accept it as fact. Challenging unhelpful or unscrutinized thoughts can lead to freedom.
Only seeing the potential for negative outcomes, and habitually disqualifying the positive, is a common cognitive distortion.;
, Everyone has had experience or at least seen others over-react to situations. For some people, these reactions can become a habit or way of seeing the world. These include:

Over-generalization. For example, a child who had a bad experience with a large dog may forever be nervous around dogs.
Jumping to conclusions. Example: A girl is nervous about an upcoming date. The boy texts that he has to reschedule. The girl decides he must not be interested in her or that would not happen, so cancels the date. In reality, the boy was interested.
""Catastrophising"". A woman is having a rough time at work, and worries that she will be fired and then will be homeless. Instead of focusing on her time management skills, she suffers from constant anxiety.
""Black and White"" Thinking--being inflexible. On a family vacation, the father is frustrated by the poor quality hotel room. Instead of focusing on the lovely beach, and the kids who scarcely spend any time at the room, he constantly grumbles and ruins the fun for everyone else.
""Should, Must, and Ought-to"" These words are often loaded with judgement. If you find yourself using these words about yourself in a negative, judgmental way, consider re-phrasing it. For example:

Negative: ""I'm out of shape; I should go to the gym."" More positive: ""I want to be healthier, and I will check out if there is a class I might like at the gym.""
Negative: ""I must get my kid to pay attention to me when I talk."" Positive: ""How can I talk so that he will listen to me more?""
Negative: ""I ought to get better than a B on my exam!"" Positive: ""I know I can get better than a B. But if I don't, a B is still a respectable grade.""
Sometimes things must, should, or ought to be done...there are some things that are properly worded in such a way. But catching yourself using these words negatively and in a rigid way indicates a way of thinking that may be unnecessarily negative and rigid.


Write down automatic thoughts in a journal or diary. Just listing what you think can help you recognize its existence, when it happens, what it is, and help you observe them.Ask yourself if there is any other way to consider the source of your cognitive distortion. Is this automatic thought part of a pattern? If so, where did it start? How is it serving you now? Becoming more conscious of your own subconscious thought patters will help keep you from overreacting., This kind of automatic thought pattern, also known as ""black and white"" thinking, is a primary cause of overreaction. Automatic thoughts are not based in rational thought, but in fearful, overly emotional reactions to stressful situations.The ""all or nothing"" thinking is a common cognitive distortion. Sometimes things are all-or-nothing, but normally there are ways to get some or most of what you want, or find an alternative.
Learn to listen critically to your inner self-talk, and notice what it's telling you. If your inner self-talk is filled with cognitive distortions, that can help you recognize that the ""voice"" that is talking to you is not necessarily accurate.
Consider practicing affirmations to follow the automatic thought. Affirmations allow you to reframe the negative, ""all or nothing"" thinking with a positive statement that reflects your new beliefs. For example, remind yourself, ""A mistake isn't failure. It's a learning process. Everyone makes mistakes. Others will understand."", Pausing to take a breath allows you time to consider possible alternatives. It may disengage you from automatic thought patterns. Breathe in through the nose for a count of four; hold the breath for a count of three, then slowly breathe out through the mouth for a count of five. Repeat if necessary.When your breathing is rapid, your body believes it is engaged in a ""fight or flight"" struggle, and raises your anxiety level. You will be more likely to respond with heightened emotions and fear.
If your breath is slower, your body will believe you're calm, and you'll be more likely to be able to access rational thought.

, Most people have ""triggers,"" which may generate emotional overreactions. Common triggers include envy, rejection, criticism, and control. By learning more about your own triggers, you'll be more likely to control your emotional reactions to them.Envy is when someone else gets something you want, or that you feel you deserve.
Rejection occurs when someone isn't excluded or turned away. Exclusion from a group activates the same brain receptors as physical pain.
Criticism allows someone to engage in the cognitive distortion of overgeneralizing. The person confuses a critical response with not being liked or appreciated as a person, not just the single act that's being criticized.
Control issues cause overreaction when you're overly worried about not getting what you want or losing what you have. This is also an example of catastrophising.

, Ask yourself, ""How important is this? Will I remember it tomorrow? Or a year from now? How about 20 years from now?"" If the answer is no, then whatever you're reacting to in the moment isn't a big deal. Allow yourself to take a step back from the situation, and acknowledge that it might not be that important.Is there any part of the situation that you can do anything about? Are there ways that you can work together with another person to make the changes that will help you? If there are, then try these.
Try to become willing to accept the parts of the situation that you can't change. This doesn't mean allowing another person to hurt you or that you shouldn't have boundaries. Sometimes it means accepting that you can't change the situation, and deciding to leave.

, When someone habitually has a difficult time regulating their temper, the brain has a weak connection between its highly responsive emotional center, and the part of the brain responsible for rational thought. Building a stronger connection between these two brain centers helps to avoid overreacting.Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) is one treatment that has been shown to be effective with people who have emotional regulation challenges. It works through increasing self-knowledge and offering cognitive restructuring.Neurofeedback and biofeedback are both therapies shown to be effective in treating people with emotional regulation issues. The patient learns to monitor his psychological response, and therefore gain control over his overreactions., Overreacting might be the result of long-standing issues that a therapist can help you sort out. Understanding the underlying causes of your overreactions can help you gain control over them.If your overreactions are affecting your relationship or marriage, consider seeing the therapist together with your partner or spouse.
A good therapist will have practical suggestions for the present challenges, but will also look for issues from your past which may be surfacing through your emotional responses.
Be patient. If your emotional overreactions are the result of long-buried issues, the treatment is likely to take some time. Don't expect results overnight.
In some cases, you may be a candidate for medication. Although ""talk therapy"" is extremely helpful for many, sometimes certain medications can help. For instance, a person with anxiety that causes a lot of overreactions, anti-anxiety medication can be helpful.

, If you're clean, you'll feel much better! Make sure you wash your whole body, shampoo (and condition) your hair, shave, wash your face, etc.

If you don't have Epsom salt, you can always use sea salt, though it won't give as much of an effect as Epsom salt. Add 1 or 2 cups to your bath, stir it with your hand for a second, then get in.

, A few facts and benefits of Epsom salt: The wonders of Epsom salt have been well known for hundreds of years and unlike other salts, Epsom salt has beneficial properties that can soothe the body, mind and soul. Some of the countless health benefits include relaxing the nervous system, curing skin problems, soothing back pain and aching limbs, easing muscle strain, healing cuts, treating cold and congestion, and drawing toxins from the body. One of the simplest ways to ease stress and stress-related problems is to soak in a tub full of hot water with a few cups of Epsom salt. Stress drains the body of magnesium and increases levels of adrenaline. When dissolved in warm water, Epsom salt is absorbed through the skin and replenishes the level of magnesium in the body. The magnesium helps to produce serotonin, a mood-elevating chemical within the brain that creates a feeling of calm and relaxation. Research shows that magnesium also increases energy and stamina by encouraging the production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the energy packets made in the cells. Experts believe that bathing with Epsom salt at least three times a week helps you to look better, feel better and gain more energy. Magnesium ions also relax and reduce irritability by lowering the effects of adrenaline. They lower blood pressure, create a relaxed feeling, improve sleep and concentration, and help muscles and nerves to function properly. Epsom salt is believed to improve heart health and help prevent heart disease and strokes by improving blood circulation, lowering blood pressure, protecting the elasticity of arteries, preventing blood clots and reducing the risk of sudden heart attack deaths. The sulfates in Epsom salt help flush toxins and heavy metals from the cells, easing muscle pain and helping the body to eliminate harmful substances. Your skin is a highly porous membrane and adding the right minerals to your bathwater triggers a process called reverse osmosis, which actually pulls salt out of your body, and harmful toxins along with it. For a detoxifying bath, at least once weekly add two cups of Epsom salt to the water in a bathtub and soak for 10 minutes., Gently massage into skin and rinse with cold water.

, Apply this mixture to the blackheads with a cotton ball.

, Once you're done soaking in your bath for 10-20 minutes, dry yourself with a clean, fresh towel. Before putting clothes on, moisturize your skin with your favorite smelling lotion, and then lightly spray on a body spray. Get into some comfy clothes- no skinny jeans, no belts, no bracelets or necklaces. Remember, you want to have a hassle free day, so don't add on a bunch of stuff. NO makeup either, you want to have clean, smooth skin, not powdery, smudgy stuff. If you hate your face without makeup, think about the people who don't even have a face. Some peoples faces get burned off or wounded. You should be happy that you have a face, so be happy, and feel pretty.

, Today's your day to relax. Maybe take a nap, write, draw, dream, clean your room. Just do whatever makes you happy!

, Though some people prefer doing yoga and meditation around sunset or after, you can do whatever you like. Light a scented candle, turn off the lights (or have them dimmed), open the window, have on some repeating calm music, and you're ready!

, It requires no special equipment, and is not complicated to learn. It can be practiced anywhere, at any given moment, and it is not time consuming (15-20 min. per day is good). Best of all, meditation has NO negative side effects. Bottom line, there is nothing but positive to be gained from it! With such a huge list of benefits, the question you should ask yourself is, “why am I not meditating yet?”


If you need a point to start from, you should try guided meditation courses. They are inexpensive and can provide you with a good foundation from which to begin meditating.

How do you meditate? Well, however you like! If you have ever loved somebody, counted, had happy emotions, then you've already meditated without thinking. Though that isn't enough, you have to know your meditating. So, first things first, get a chair with a back to it. Sit up straight in it. If you need to, place a soft pillow behind. Close you eyes. Your protected. Your loved. Listen to the wind in the window, the soft, soft music. Listen to your body. Are you in pain? Focus on that spot. Breath in through your nose. Imagine there's a tube from your mouth that goes up into your brain, and then goes down your belly. So when you breath in, imagine that air going up, up into your brain, then down to your belly, then you can breathe out. Make sure you sitting up straight, and when you exhale you breath out your mouth. Imagine little clouds far from you, but you can still see them. When you breathe in, the clouds come up to you, and when you breathe out, they zip away, out of sight. Keep doing that. Have a faint smile on your face, and keep doing this for as long as you like. Remember, this is not the only form of meditation. There's many methods, you can even create your own. Once you have practiced meditation for a while, you can even fit it into regular day things. If you're working out, you can meditate. If you are doing yoga, you can meditate.

Get enough rest.,
Make sure to eat regularly.,
Exercise regularly.,
Be aware of your emotions.",How to Avoid Overreacting2," Sleep deprivation is a common source of stress, and can result in short tempers and overly-emotional responses to everyday situations. Taking care of yourself involves getting plenty of rest. If you're not getting enough sleep, it will be harder to change patterns of overreaction.Avoid caffeine if it interferes with your sleep. Caffeine is found in sodas, coffee, teas, and other beverages. If you're drinking a beverage, make sure it doesn't contain caffeine.
Feeling tired increases your stress level, and may cause you to think irrationally.
If you can't alter your sleep schedule, try to include rest and relaxation times as a part of your daily schedule. Short naps may help.

, If you're hungry, you're more likely to overreact. Include healthy, regular meals throughout your day. Make sure to eat a healthy breakfast with lots of protein and avoid hidden sugars in breakfast foods.Avoid junk foods, sugary foods or other foods that may result in rapid elevation of blood sugar. Sugary snacks contribute to stress.

, Exercise helps emotional regulation, and brings about a more positive mood. 30 minutes of moderate exercise at least 5 times per week has been shown to have benefits for mood regulation.Aerobic exercises, such as swimming, walking, running or cycling, use the lungs and heart. Include aerobic exercises as part of your workout routine no matter what other exercises you choose to include. If you can't spare 30 minutes per day, start with a shorter time period. Even 10-15 minutes will bring improvement.Strength training, such as weight lifting or resistance training, helps strengthen bones as well as muscles.
Flexibility exercises, such as stretching and yoga, help prevent injury. Yoga helps address anxiety and stress, and is highly recommended for those trying to avoid overreacting.

, When someone isn't aware of their feelings until they're already overreacting, it can be difficult to change. The trick is to become aware of your emotions before they're too big. Learn to identify within yourself the precursors to being overly reactive.Signs may be physical, such as a stiff neck or rapid heartbeat.
Naming the feeling means that you're able to employ both sides of your brain in developing coping strategies.
The more aware you become of your own internal reactions, the less likely you will be to become overwhelmed by them.

Set aside five minutes.,
Get into position.,
Take deep breaths into your abdomen.",How to Do a Quick and Easy Meditation2," You don't need a lot of time to perform breathing exercises, though you can take as much time as you want. The important thing is to make time for calm, relaxing breathing as soon as you notice yourself feeling tense or anxious.It won't take long for you to feel the effects of deep breathing exercises, though you can continue deep breathing for as long as you'd like.
Try to find a place where you won't be disturbed. If you can't find a quiet place inside, try sitting outside.

, When you're ready to begin, you should get into a comfortable position. You can sit on the floor or in a chair, so long as you can keep a straight posture.Sit up straight, keeping your back and neck aligned.
Close your eyes. This can help block out distractions and promote a state of relaxation.
You may want to put one hand on your belly. This can help you feel your breathing, which can help you recognize whether or not you're breathing deeply.

, Deep breathing is as simple as taking slow, deep, long inhalations and slow, extended exhalations. You can do it for as long or as short as you need to. Any time your mind wanders back to something stressful, simply focus on your breath.Inhale slowly through your nostrils.
Feel your breath travel down into your abdomen to your diaphragm (just below the ribs).
Focus on the sensations of breathing deeply, in and out.
You should be able to feel your belly rise and fall on each breath with your hand. If you don't feel your breath, you may need to take slower, deeper breaths.

Find a quiet space.,
Get comfortable.,
Focus on your breath.,
Open your eyes slowly.",How to Do a Quick and Easy Meditation3," You can meditate anywhere, but it's best to find a quiet place free of distractions. If you're at work and you have an office, try closing the door. If you don't have your own space, you can go for a walk on your lunch break and find a peaceful place away from the office.If possible, reduce distractions by silencing your cellphone and turning off your computer.
Try and find someplace you can be alone for 5 to 10 minutes. If you can't find a quiet space indoors, you might want to try sitting outside (if the weather permits it).

, Comfort is very important when you meditate. There's no prescribed position; it's just crucial that you get into a position that helps you relax.When some people think of seated meditation, they picture a meditation master sitting in perfect lotus position with the legs crossed. If this is comfortable for you, then go ahead, but if not just find what makes you relaxed.
You can try sitting with your legs crossed, sitting in a regular chair or on a bench, or even lying flat on the floor.
If you're comfortable (and feel safe) closing your eyes, then go ahead. If not, keep your eyes open but try to focus on a point on the ground just in front of you.

, Deep breathing is at the heart of meditation. Concentrate on the sensation of breathing, and try to block out any other thoughts. Any time you find your mind wandering or your thoughts racing, simply return your focus to your breath.Don't take shallow breaths in your chest; instead, take deep breaths that go all the way down to your diaphragm (below the ribs).
Feel the air flow through your nostrils and into your lungs. Notice the sensation of your belly rising and falling with each inhalation and exhalation.
You can either set a timer for 5 to 10 minutes, or simply breathe until you feel a sense of calm come over you.
You can take these little meditation breaks anytime and any place when you need to calm down and quiet an anxious mind.

, When you're finished, slowly open your eyes. Don't get up right away; give your eyes and your mind a moment to adjust to your present environment.You may have things to do, but it's important to let the sense of calmness linger for a moment. Open your eyes slowly and carefully, taking in your surroundings.
Stand up slowly. If you hit a level of deep relaxation during your meditation, standing up too quickly could cause you to get light headed or disoriented.

Get comfortable and breathe deeply.,
Choose relaxing sensations.,
Open your eyes and stand up slowly.",How to Do a Quick and Easy Meditation4," Try to find a quiet place where you'll be able to relax. Use deep breathing exercises, feeling the air pass through your nostrils and raising/lowering your abdomen.Sit in a quiet spot and eliminate as many distractions as you can. Silence your cellphone and close the door (if possible).
Loosen any tight clothing so that you won't be restricted.
Close your eyes and concentrate on your breathing.

, You can visualize whatever you want. It can be a real place you've been, or a place that you completely imagine. Try to incorporate as many sensory details as possible to ""trick"" your brain into thinking you're really there in that moment.Start by picturing a visual image. Choose a place that is totally relaxing. It doesn't matter if you've never been there, just imagine a place of peace and tranquility.
Imagine the sounds you'd hear there. For example, if your visual image was a quiet beach, you might imagine the sound of waves slowly lapping or surging against the shore.
Next, imagine the physical sensations you might experience there. If you're on a beach, you might imagine the sun warming your skin and the gritty feeling of sand underneath you.
Try to incorporate an olfactory sense, if you can. On the beach, for example, you might smell the ocean's salty water wafting in on the breeze, or perhaps the smell of sun screen on your body.

, You can continue visualizing for as long as you'd like. When you're ready, simply open your eyes (slowly) and get ready to stand up. Take it slow, since your body and mind just left a state of relaxation and may need to readjust to waking life.


Open your eyes slowly. After closing your eyes and imagining a quiet, peaceful place, it may be jarring to remember your actual immediate surroundings.
Don't try to stand up too quickly or you might get disoriented.
You may want to stretch out your muscles before you stand up to get the blood flowing again.
Fix any clothing you might have loosened, and you should be calm and ready to tackle the rest of your day.

Slow down your breathing.,
Tense and hold your muscles in sequence.,
Keep breathing and open your eyes.",How to Do a Quick and Easy Meditation5," Before you begin tensing your muscles, it may be helpful to engage in deep breathing. Breathe all the way down into your abdomen slowly, focusing on the sensation of your breath. Keep taking deep breaths until you feel a sense of calm and are ready to begin., Go through the list of muscle groups in sequence. As you work through each muscle group, tense the muscles for about five seconds each, then let go and let the muscles relax for about 10 seconds.Start by making a fist with your right hand and tensing your forearm.
Lift your right forearm to tense your upper arm, as though you were flexing your muscles.
Repeat these steps for the left hand/arm.
Tense your forehead by lifting your eyebrows as high as they can go.
Squeeze your eyes closed tightly.
Open your mouth as wide as you can to flex your facial muscles.
Lift your shoulders up towards your ears. Then push them back, trying to touch your shoulder blades together.
Tense your stomach muscles. Then move to your hips and buttocks, squeezing your muscles together.
Tighten the muscles in your right thigh, then (slowly) stretch your calf muscle while curling your toes at a downward angle.
Repeat for your left leg/foot.

, When you've finished tensing and relaxing your muscle groups, take a few moments to keep taking deep breaths. You may also want to stretch out your muscles to resume normal blood flow.Open your eyes and regain a sense of your surroundings.
Don't stand up too quickly, or you may get disoriented or experience tense muscles.
Simply sit for a few moments, breathing and stretching.

Think about what you want to achieve with your meditation.,
Find a distraction-free area.,
Use a meditation cushion.,
Wear comfortable clothes.,
Choose a time when you’re comfortable.,
Have a timer at hand.,
Sit on your cushion or chair with a straight back.,
Don’t fret about what to do with your hands.,
Tilt your chin as though you’re looking downward.,
Set your timer.,
Keep your mouth closed as you breathe.You should both inhale and exhale through your nose when meditating.,
Focus on your breathing.This is what meditation’s all about.,
Observe your breath, but don’t analyze it.The goal is to be present within each breath, not to be able to describe it.,
Bring your attention back to your breath if it wanders.,
Don’t be too hard on yourself.",How to Meditate for Beginners," People come to meditation for a wide range of reasons — whether to improve their creativity, help visualize a goal, quiet their inner chatter, or make a spiritual connection. If your only goal is to spend a few minutes every day being present in your body without worrying about everything you have to do, that’s reason enough to meditate. Try not to over-complicate your reasons for meditating. At its core, meditation is just about relaxing and refusing to be caught up in everyday anxieties.;
, Especially when you’re just starting out, it’s important to clear your environment of distracting sensations. Turn off the TV and radio, close your windows against the street sounds outside, and close your door to noisy roommates. If you share your home with roommates or family members, you may find it difficult to find a quiet space where you can focus on meditation. Ask the people you live with if they would be willing to keep quiet for the duration of your meditation exercise. Promise to come tell them as soon as you’re finished, so they can resume their normal activities.


A scented candle, a bouquet of flowers, or incense can be great little touches to enhance your meditation experience.
Dim or turn out the lights to help you concentrate.

, Meditation cushions are also known as zafus. A zafu is a circular cushion that allows you to sit on the ground while meditating. Because it does not have a back, like a chair does, it doesn’t let you slump back and lose focus on your energy. If you don’t have a zafu, any old pillow or sofa cushion will do to keep you from getting sore during long stretches of cross-legged sitting.


If you find that sitting without a chair-back hurts your back, feel free to use a chair. Try to be present in your body and maintain a straight back for as long as it feels comfortable, then lean back until you feel you can do it again.

, You don’t want anything to pull you out of your meditative thinking, so avoid restrictive clothing that might pull on you, like jeans or tight pants. Think about what you might wear to exercise or to sleep in — those types of loose, breathable clothes are your best bet.

, When you’re more familiar with meditation, you might use it to calm you down when you’re feeling anxious or overwhelmed. But if you’re a beginner, you may find it hard to concentrate at first if you’re not in the right frame of mind. When you’re starting out, meditate when you already feel relaxed — perhaps first thing in the morning, or after you’ve had to unwind after school or work.


Remove every distraction you can think of before you sit down to meditate. Grab a light snack if you’re feeling hungry, use the restroom if you need to, and so on.

, You want to ensure you practice your meditation for long enough, but you also don’t want to break your concentration by checking the time. Set a timer for the length of time you wish to meditate — whether 10 minutes or an hour. Your phone may have a built-in timer on it, or you can find many websites and apps that will time your sessions for you., The upright posture helps you to concentrate on your breathing as you purposefully inhale and exhale. If you’re sitting in a chair with a back, try not to lean back against it or slouch. Stay as erect as possible.


Position your legs in whichever manner is comfortable to you. You can extend them out in front of you or cross them beneath you like a pretzel if you’re using a cushion on the ground. The most important thing is that your posture remains straight.

, In the media, we often see people holding their hands at their knees when meditating, but if that’s uncomfortable for you, don’t worry about it. You can fold them in your lap, let them hang at your sides — whatever allows you to clear your mind and concentrate on your breathing.

, It doesn’t matter if your eyes are opened or closed when you meditate, though many people find it easier to block out visual distractions with closed eyes. Either way, tilting your head as though you’re looking down helps open up the chest and ease your breathing.

, When you’re in a comfortable position and are ready to get started, set your timer for however long you’d like to meditate. Don’t feel any pressure to reach an hour-long transcendental state during your first week. Start small with 3-5 minute sessions, and work your way up to half an hour, or even longer if you’d like., However, make sure your jaw muscles are relaxed, even though your mouth is closed. Don’t clench your jaws or grind your teeth; simply relax.

, Instead of trying not to think about the things that might stress you out on a day-to-day basis, give yourself something positive to focus on: your breath. By focusing all of your concentrating on your inhalations and exhalations, you’ll find that all other thoughts from the outside world fall away on their own, without you having to worry about how to ignore them.


Concentrate on your breathing in the way that’s most comfortable for you. Some people like to focus on how the lungs expand and contract, while others like to think about how air passes through the nose when they breathe.
You might even focus on the sound of your breathing. Just bring yourself to a state of mind where you’re solely focused on some aspect of your breath.

, Don’t worry about remembering what you’re feeling, or being able to explain the experience at a later time. Just experience each breath in the moment. When it passes, experience the next breath. Try not to think about the breathing with your mind – just experience it through your senses.

, Even when you’ve gained a lot of experience with meditation, you’ll find that your thoughts might wander. You’ll start thinking about work or bills or the errands you have to run later. Whenever you notice the outside world creeping in, don’t panic and try to ignore them. Instead, gently nudge your focus back to the sensation of your breath in your body, and let other thoughts fall away again.


You may find it easier to maintain your focus on inhalations than on exhalations. Keep this in mind if you find it to be true. Try to concentrate especially on the feeling of your breath as it leaves your body.
Try counting your breaths if you’re having trouble refocusing your attention.

, Accept that focus will be hard for you when you’re just starting out. Don't berate yourself––all beginners experience the inner chatter. In fact, some would say that this continual return to the present moment is the ""practice"" of meditation. Furthermore, don’t expect your meditation practice to change your life overnight. Mindfulness takes time to exert its influence. Keep coming back to meditation every day for at least a few minutes, lengthening your sessions when possible.

, Bedrooms are generally not a good place to meditate, especially if you meditate in the morning. Move to another quiet room or nook.


If you don't have another comfortable place to meditate, you can set aside an area of your bedroom to be used only for meditation or worship.

, Choose a place where you can expect privacy for the duration of your meditation. Avoid places with noise, television screens, and other distractions. Keep the area clean and free from clutter, even when you are not using it.

, Some people prefer to sit on a cushion (zafu in Zen Buddhist tradition) or other special object used only for meditating. This and other materials are completely optional, but include them in your meditation area if they help.


If you have an appointment you need to make, have a stop watch or phone set to notify you when you need to stop meditating.
You don't need the picture-perfect meditation set up. Incense and mood lighting are entirely optional.

, All you really need to meditate is the desire to do it. Setting up a meditation area can help, especially for beginners, but don't use noise or discomfort as an excuse not to try it. Meditation can happen anywhere.

, The natural silence of the early morning can be the perfect catalyst for meditation. Wake up, wash your face, and go to your meditation spot.

, Many people meditate because it's on the schedule, or because it's supposed to be good for them. Going through the motions like this makes it difficult to benefit from the experience.

Find the right spot.There is no one size or location for a meditation chamber that is better than others.,
Draw a boundary line.,
Paint the walls a relaxing color.If you have the ability to change the wall color of your meditation chamber, switch it to a light, relaxing hue.,
Give yourself a place to sit.,
Create an altar.,
Set the ambiance with the right sort of lighting.,
Include a CD player.,
Keep your decorations simple and meaningful.Avoid filling your space with extra clutter.",How to Create a Meditation Chamber," An open, spacious room can work just as well as a small closet or a secluded corner. It all depends on what you need to help you focus. A large, empty room can feel spacious and fresh, but a small space can provide you with the comfort of a makeshift womb. Just make sure that whatever space you choose can be set aside for use as a meditation chamber. A space that receives a lot of foot traffic can cause distraction, which is not conducive to a calming meditation chamber.


If you are someone who connects well with nature, you can also create a meditation chamber outside in your backyard or garden. This works best if you live in a quiet neighborhood with little distraction, however.;
, Keep your meditation chamber distinct from the surrounding area.


If you have the good fortune of having a meditation chamber in a room or closet with a door, the problem is already solved for you. Even so, you may want to consider hanging some sheer curtains to let just enough soft light in while blocking out unnecessary distractions from outside.
If you have to share part of a larger room, even if that room is your own private bedroom, specifically set aside your chamber space by creating a boundary. Hang a curtain or put up a wood panel floor screen.

, Cool tone colors like green, blue, or purple work best, especially in pastel shades. White or off-white can also work, and you may also be able to get away with pastel shades of a few warmer tones like tan, blush, or yellow. In general, though, you should stay away from warmer colors since they tend to energize a space rather than calm it. Bold red and orange are especially unbefitting.

, Few people can relax while standing. You can opt to sit in a chair, sit on the floor, or kneel while meditating. Regardless of what you choose, though, you should make sure that your chamber has a place to do it at.


If you prefer sitting in a chair, choose a chair that is both simple and relatively comfortable. A hard metal fold-up chair will probably be too uncomfortable, but a fancy recliner may be too extravagant. A wooden table or desk chair with a cushion might be a good in between option to consider.
If you prefer sitting on the floor or kneeling, keep a cushion or mat in the room. A cushion is especially useful if you plan on sitting, while a mat tends to be the floor covering of choice for people who kneel.

, An altar can really give your chamber a sense if sacredness. You can use just about any flat surface to create an altar, even a windowsill. If you can, though, you may want to consider a small stone slab or low wooden prayer table. You could leave the space empty if you want, but usually, an altar is where you would place items that help you focus during meditation.

, Low, dim lighting is ideal. Bright lights can be distracting and may leave you feeling exposed or out in the open. By contrast, dim lights have a warm, soothing effect that make the chamber feel more personal. If you have a meditation chamber with windows, letting natural daylight filter in through sheer curtains may provide you with all the light you need. If you are meditating in a windowless chamber or at night, consider lining the area with candles. You can place a few on your altar or around the chamber.


You can also create an appropriate ambiance simply by using a dimmer switch to tone down the overhead lighting of the room. Floor lamps or desk lamps with dim settings will work, as well.

, If you plan on meditating in silence, then obviously, a CD player is unnecessary. For many, however, the right music or background noise can make the meditation experience more effective. If you have yet to do so, try filling your meditation chamber with classical or other calm music. If music is too distracting, find a CD of calming sounds to fill your space with. Think babbling brooks, ocean waves, and singing birds.

, A meditation chamber should create a clean sensation, which will be hard to accomplish in a room that is dirtied by piles of clutter. Simple wall decorations can work well. Decorations that have spiritual significance tend to work even better.


Look for sacred pieces. Sacred texts, sayings, talismans, or statues are fairly common.
Make the space personal. Mementos that hold personal significance or photographs of loved ones emphasize that your mediation chamber is a place close to your heart.
Bring in a bit of nature. Flowers, plants, stones, and shells are all elements of the outdoors that often have the potential to soothe people.

Scented bath oil
Body lotion
Face mask
Hair products (Shampoo/conditioner)
Soap
Body scrub
Bath salts
Waterproof bath pillow or rolled hand towel
Candles
Music
Bathrobe
Bath sheets/towels;
, Candles are great for relaxing as they create a softer, more ambient light. You can use your favorite scented candles to add an extra relaxing aroma.


Pick a scent that relaxes you. Suggestions include vanilla, lavender, verbena, or whatever you prefer.Place candles safely. Avoid placing them near anything flammable such as draperies, towels, or paper products.
If you are placing candles around the tub, be careful not to accidentally burn yourself on them. Also, be careful not to knock them into the water.
Avoid wax drips by using candles in holders or self-contained in jars.

, Music has many neurological effects and can be very relaxing.It can help you to relax and reduce stress. Play your favorite music while taking a bath.


There are waterproof speakers you can purchase that stick to the side of the tub or shower.
Avoid bringing electronics into the bath with you. Water can damage your electronics.
To play music, try setting your smartphone or tablet on the sink (or another dry area) to play music through its speaker.

, Place them near the tub so you do not have to search for them when getting out. For extra comfort, warm up your towels in a dryer before your bath.


Another effective way to keep your towels warm is to hang them above a heat vent in your bathroom. Be careful not to place them directly over a heat source as it may cause a fire hazard., If you do not plan on getting your hair or face wet, you can use a face mask or exfoliant on your skin for extra pampering. Place this on your face before you get into the tub to let it set and relax you.


There are many DIY face mask recipes out there. For example, an avocado (1 large avocado) and honey (2 tablespoons) mask is very easy and contains many healthy vitamins and minerals for your face., If you live with others, you may find it difficult to get time to yourself. Make sure you tell the others in your household that you plan on taking a relaxing bath and you wish for some time alone. This will help mitigate intrusion and help you relax without worrying about interruptions.


Consider locking the door for extra privacy.

, A grungy tub does not make for a relaxing bath. Start with a clean tub for best results.


A quick way to clean a tub without a harsh chemical smell is to use baking soda. This cuts through soap scum without harsh smells. You can make a simple baking soda paste with 1 cup baking soda and add water for the desired consistency.
Add the paste to the tub and let it dry. Wipe out the baking soda with a warm sponge, making sure to scrub any stubborn residue.

, You will want a water temperature warm enough to relax you but not hot enough to damage your skin or burn you. Try to get a temperature between 95-101 degrees Fahrenheit.Make sure the drain is closed and fill the tub.

, While the water is running, add desired infusions such as bubble bath or oils. The running water will disperse the bubbles and scents more easily.


If you wait until the tub is full and the water is off, the oil may just sink to the bottom of the tub.
Choose a scent that you like that makes you feel good. Good scents may be something like honey, almond, lavender, sea salt, vanilla., You can use bath bombs or epsom salt to help with relaxation.Epsom salt baths include many benefits including pain relief, stress relief, and skin care.
Bath bombs come in many scents! They are also quite easy to make and can provide an interesting fizz to a normal bath.

, Once the tub is full of warm, scented water, slowly get into the tub and lower yourself into the water. Be careful as areas may be slick.


If you want to rest your head against the tub, you can use a waterproof bath pillow or hand towel (rolled length-wise). Place the pillow or towel behind your neck and relax.

, This will help your mind relax more efficiently.You can try to meditate by breathing in through your mouth and out through pursed lips. This will help you relax.If desired dip your head underwater to get your hair and face wet.


Be careful not to get too relaxed and fall asleep. This can cause you to drown.

, You do not want to be interrupted or distracted with the outside world. Try to leave electronics like smartphones out of the bathroom or away from reach. This is time for solitude.


You may choose to use your smartphone to listen to music. Try to avoid using it for internet browsing or for checking your e-mail.

, When you are sufficiently relaxed or the water has gone cold, grab a towel and get out of the bath. Wrap yourself up and dry yourself off.


Put lotion on your body to moisturize your skin. This will trap the moisture into your skin.
Wash off your facemask, if applicable.

This will enable you to focus exclusively on the task at hand and avoid bombarding your mind with outside stimuli. Try to find a place where you will not be interrupted for the duration of your meditation - whether it lasts five minutes or half an hour. The space does not need to be very large - a walk-in closet or even your office can be used for meditation, as long as it's somewhere private.


For those new to meditation, it's especially important to avoid any external distractions. Turn off TV sets, the phone or other noisy appliances. If you play music, choose calm, repetitive and gentle tunes, so as not to break your concentration. Another option is to turn on a small water fountain - the sound of running water can be extremely calming.
Understand that the meditation space does not need to be completely silent, so there should be no need to reach for the earplugs. The sound of a lawnmower running or the dog barking next door shouldn't prevent effective meditation. In fact, being aware of these noises but not letting them dominate your thoughts is an important component of successful meditation.
Meditating outside works for many meditators. As long as you don't sit near a busy roadway or another source of loud noise, you can find peace under a tree or sitting upon some lush grass in a favorite corner of the garden.

, One of the major goals of meditation is to calm the mind and block out external factors. This can be difficult if you feel physically uncomfortable due to tight or restrictive clothing. Try to wear loose clothing during meditation practice and make sure to remove your shoes.


Wear a sweater or cardigan if you plan on meditating someplace cool. If you don't, the sensation of being cold will consume your thoughts and you will be tempted to cut your practice short.
If you are in the office, or somewhere that you can't easily change your clothes, do your best to make yourself as comfortable as possible. Take off your shoes and jacket, open the collar of your shirt or blouse and remove your belt.

, Before you begin, you should decide how long you are going to meditate. While many seasoned meditators recommend twenty minute sessions twice a day, beginners can start out doing as little as five minutes, once a day.


You should also try to meditate at the same time each day - whether it's 15 minutes first thing in the morning, or five minutes on your lunch hour. Whatever time you choose, try to make meditation an unshakable part of your daily routine.
Once you have decided on a time frame, try to stick to it. Don't just give up because you feel like it isn't working - it will take time and practice to achieve successful meditation - right now, the most important thing is to keep trying.
Although you will want to keep track of your meditation time, it is not beneficial to be constantly checking your watch. Think about setting a gentle alarm to alert you when your practice is up, or time your practice to end with a certain event - such as your partner getting out of bed, or the sun hitting a certain spot on the wall.

, Meditation involves sitting in one spot for a certain period of time, so it is important to minimize any tension or tightness before you begin. Doing a couple of minutes of light stretching can really help to loosen you up and prepare both your body and mind for meditation. It will also prevent you from focusing on any sore spots instead of relaxing your mind.


Remember to stretch your neck and shoulders, especially if you've been sitting in front of a computer, and don't forget your lower back. Stretching out your legs, particularly those on the inner thigh, can be helpful when meditating in the lotus position.
More information on specific stretching techniques can be found here.

, As stated above, it is very important that you are comfortable while you meditate, which is why finding the best position for you is essential. Traditionally, meditation is practiced by sitting on a cushion on the ground, in a lotus, or half-lotus position. Unless your legs, hips, and low back are very flexible, lotus postures tend to bow your low back and prevent you from balancing your torso around your spine. Choose a posture that allows you to be balanced tall and straight.


However, you can also sit without crossing your legs, on a cushion, chair, or meditation bench. Your pelvis needs to be tilted forwards enough for your spine to be centered over the two bony bits in your butt, the spots that bear your weight. To tilt your pelvis into the right position, sit on the forward edge of a thick cushion, or place something about 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2 cm) thick under the back legs of a chair. Meditation benches are usually built with a tilted seat. If not, put something under it to tilt it forward between a half inch and an inch.
The most important thing is that you are comfortable, relaxed, and your torso is balanced so that your spine supports all of your weight from the waist up.
Tilt your pelvis forward. Then, starting from your bottom, stack up the vertebrae in your spine, so that they are balanced one on top of another and support the whole weight of your torso, neck, and head. It requires practice to find the position that allows you to relax your whole torso almost completely, only slight effort being used to maintain your balance. Whenever you feel tension, relax the area. If you can't relax it without slumping, check the alignment of your posture and seek to re-balance your torso so that area can relax.
The traditional hand placement involves resting your hands in your lap, palms facing upward, with your right hand on top of your left. However, your can also just rest your hands on your knees or leave them hanging down by your side - whichever you prefer.

, Meditation can be performed with the eyes open or closed, however as a beginner it may be best to first try meditating with your eyes closed. This will block out any external visual stimulation and prevent you from becoming distracted as you focus on calming your mind.


Once you have grown accustomed to meditation, you can try practicing with your eyes open. This can be helpful if you find you are either falling asleep or concentrating too hard with your eyes closed, or if you are experiencing disturbing mental images (which happens to a small proportion of people).When you keep your eyes open, you will need to keep them ""soft"" - that is, not focused on anything in particular. However, you don't want to go into a trance-like state either - the goal is to feel relaxed but alert., The most basic and universal of all meditation techniques, breathing meditation is a great place to start your practice. Pick a spot above your navel and focus on that spot with your mind. Become aware of the rising and falling of your abdomen as you breathe in and out. Don't make a conscious effort to change your breathing patterns, just breathe normally.


Try to focus on your breathing and only your breathing. Don't think about your breathing or pass any sort of judgment of it (e.g. that breath was shorter than the last one), just attempt to know it and be aware of it.Some mental images which might help you include: imagining a coin sitting on the spot above your navel, rising and falling with your breath; imagining a buoy floating in the ocean, bobbing up and down with the swell and lull of your breathing; or imagining a lotus flower sitting in your belly, unfurling its petals with every intake of breath.
Don't worry if your mind starts to wander - you are a beginner and, like anything, becoming good at meditation takes practice. Just make an effort to refocus your mind on your breathing and try to think of nothing else. Drown out the chatter and attempt to clear your mind

,


To meditate, you must focus on one thing maximum
If you're a beginner, it might help to focus on one thing, like a mantra or visual object. More advanced meditators may try to clear their minds completely.

, Mantra meditation is another common form of meditation, which involves repeating a mantra (a sound, word or phrase) over and over, until you silence the mind and enter a deep meditative state. The mantra can be anything you choose, as long as it is easy to remember.


Some good mantras to start out with include words like one, peace, calm, tranquil, and silence. If you want to use more traditional mantras, you can use the word ""Om"" which symbolizes omnipresent consciousness, or the phrase ""Sat, Chit, Ananda"" which means ""Existence, Consciousness, Bliss"".
In Sanskrit, the word mantra means ""instrument of the mind"". The mantra is an instrument which creates vibrations in the mind, allowing you to disconnect from your thoughts and enter a deeper state of consciousness.
Silently repeat the mantra over and over to yourself as you meditate, allowing the word or phrase to whisper through your mind. Don't worry if your mind wanders off, just refocus your attention and return to repeating the word.As you enter a deeper level of awareness and consciousness, it may become unnecessary to continue repeating the mantra.

, In a similar way to using a mantra, you can use a simple visual object to fill your mind and allow you to reach a level of deeper consciousness. This is a form of open-eye meditation, which many people find easier when they have something to focus their gaze on.


The visual object can be anything you wish, though many people find the flame of a lit candle particularly pleasant. Other possible objects include crystals, flowers, and pictures or statues of divine beings, such as the Buddha.
Place the object at eye level, so you don't need to strain your head and neck to view it. Gaze at it and nothing else, until your peripheral vision starts to dim and the object consumes your vision.
Once you are focused entirely on the object, with no other stimuli reaching your brain, you should feel a sense of profound serenity., Visualization is another popular meditation technique, which involves creating a peaceful place in your mind and exploring it, until you reach a state of complete calm. The place can be anywhere you like - however, it should not be entirely real, it should be unique and personalized for you.


The place you visualize could be a warm, sandy beach, a flower-filled meadow, a quiet forest or even a comfortable sitting room with a roaring fire. Whatever place you choose, allow it to be your sanctuary.
Once you have entered your sanctuary, allow yourself to explore. There's no need to ""create"" your surroundings, they are already there. Allow them to come to the forefront of your mind.
Take in the sights, sounds and scents of your surroundings - feel the fresh breeze against your face, or the heat of the flames warming your body. Enjoy the space for as long as you wish, allowing it to naturally expand and become more tangible. When you are ready to leave, take a few deep breaths, then open your eyes.
Know that you can come back to this same place the next time you meditate to visualization, or you can simply create a new space. Any space you create will be unique to you and a reflection of your individual personality.

, Doing a body scan involves focusing on each individual body part in turn and consciously relaxing it. It is a simple meditation technique which allows you to relax the mind as you relax the body.


Close your eyes and pick a starting point on your body, usually the toes. Concentrate on whatever sensations you can feel in your toes, and make a conscious effort to relax any contracted muscles and release any tension or tightness. Once the toes are fully relaxed, move on to your feet and repeat the relaxation process.
Continue along your body, moving upwards from your feet to your calves, knees, thighs, buttocks, hips, abdomen, chest, back, shoulders, arms, hands, fingers, neck, face, ears and top of your head. Take as long as you want.
Once you have completed the relaxation of each individual body part, focus on your body as a whole and enjoy the sensation of calmness and looseness you have achieved. Focus on your breathing for several minutes before coming out of your meditation practice.

, The heart chakra is one of seven chakras, or energy centers, located within the body. The heart chakra is located in the center of the chest and is associated with love, compassion, peace and acceptance. Heart chakra meditation involves getting in touch with these feelings and sending them out into the world.


To begin, close your eyes and rub the palms of your hands together to create warmth and energy. Then, place your right hand on the center of your chest, over your heart chakra, and place the left hand on top.
Take a deep breath and as you exhale, say the word ""yam"", which is the vibration associated with the heart chakra. As you do this, imagine a glowing green energy radiating from your chest and into your palms.
This green energy is love, life and whatever other positive emotions you are feeling at that moment. When you are ready, take your hands from your chest and allow the energy to escape from your palms, sending your love to your loved ones and the world.
Feel your body from the inside. Can you feel the energy field in your body, especially in your arms and legs? If you don't feel it, it's fine. But think: How are we able to move different parts of the body? It's the energy field that flows in our body. Focusing your attention on that energy field will not only help you stay in the present but also will help you connect with your Being and flow of life in you.

, Walking meditation is alternate form of meditation which involves observing the movement of the feet and becoming aware of your body's connection to the earth. If you plan on performing long, seated meditation sessions, it is a good idea to break them up up with some walking meditation.


Choose a quiet location to practice your walking meditation, with as few distractions as possible. The space doesn't need to be very large, but you should be able to walk at least seven paces in a straight line before needing to turn around. Remove your shoes, if possible.
Holding your head up with your gaze directed straight ahead, and your hands clasped together in front of you. Take a slow, deliberate step with your right foot. Forget about any sensations or feelings in the foot and try to concentrate on the movement itself. After taking the first step, stop for a moment before taking the next. Only one foot should be moving at any given time.
When you reach the end of your walking path, stop completely, with your feet together. Then, pivot on the right foot and turn around. Continue walking in the opposite direction, using the same slow, deliberate movements as before.
While practicing walking meditation, try to focus on the movement of the feet and nothing else, in the same way that you focus on the rising and falling of your breath during breathing meditation. Try to clear your mind and become aware of the connection between your foot and the earth below., Meditation doesn't have to be limited to strictly defined practice sessions, you can also practice mindfulness throughout your day to day life.


For example, in moments of stress, try to take a few seconds to focus solely on your breathing and empty your mind of any negative thoughts or emotions.
You can also practice mindfulness while you eat, becoming aware of the food and of the sensations you experience as you eat.
No matter what actions you perform in your day to day life, whether it's sitting at a computer or sweeping the floor, try to become more aware of your body's movements and how you feel in the present moment. This is living mindfully., A healthy lifestyle can contribute to more effective and beneficial meditation, so try to eat healthily, exercise and get enough sleep. You should also avoid watching too much television, or drinking or smoking before meditation, as these activities can numb the mind and prevent you from achieving the level of concentration necessary for successful meditation., Though not for everyone, some people find that reading spiritual books and sacred writings can help them to further understand meditation and inspire them to strive for inner peace and spiritual understanding.


Some good books to start with include A Profound Mind: Cultivating Wisdom in Everyday Life by the Dalai Lama, The Nature of Personal Reality by Jane Roberts, ""A New Earth"" by Eckhart tolle and One-Minute Mindfulness by Donald Altman.
If you wish, you can pick out any nuggets of wisdom that resonate with you from any spiritual or sacred texts and reflect on them during your next meditation session.

, If you are unsure about where to begin when it comes to meditating at home, it may be a good idea to take a guided meditation class with an experienced teacher first.


Meditation classes exist for most types of meditation, but you could also try going on a spiritual retreat where you will get a chance to sample different types of meditation and find out what works best for you.

, It is important that you make an effort to do your meditation practice at the same time each day. This way, the meditation will quickly become a part of your everyday routine and you will feel its benefits much more profoundly.


Early in the morning is a good time to meditate, before your mind becomes consumed with the stresses and worries of the day.
It is not a good idea to meditate directly after eating though, as you may feel uncomfortable and this will interfere with your concentration.

, The purpose of meditation is to calm the mind, achieve inner peace and, eventually, reach a higher spiritual dimension, often referred to simply as being.


However, it is important to realize that it may take years of practice to achieve the level of awareness or higher consciousness experienced by yogis and monks. This does not matter.
Meditation is a journey, akin to climbing a mountain, where every step along the path of enlightenment brings you closer to the summit.
When starting off, you shouldn't be too concerned with the quality of the meditation itself. As long as you feel calmer, happier and more at peace at the end of your practice, you will know that your meditation was successful."

Visualize good health.,
Breathe to relax your stomach.,
Manage your stress.,
Progressively relax your muscles.",How to Relax Your Stomach1," Scientists are increasingly arguing that there is a solid connection between thoughts and physical health.

You can use this technique to help relax your stomach.Begin by relaxing. You might need a quiet space for this. Relax and become aware of your breathing.
Picture good health. Your idea of feeling well is unique to you. Imagine your stomach feeling better, what you’d do if your stomach felt great. Be detailed. You might be able to see a mental picture or you may just have a feeling – either is appropriate.
Take steps to bring what you imagined to reality. You were detailed in your visualization, and you can employ some of those details in your everyday life.;
, You likely breathe from your chest rather than your stomach, as most of us were taught to do. Many believe that breathing from your stomach, the way you did as an infant, offers a list of health benefits, including relaxing your stomach. Qigong breathing, or belly breathing, may take some getting used to, but is well worth the effort.If you can, breathe only through your nose.
Take long, steady, slow breaths.
As you inhale, focus on your breath coming in and travelling through your body, all the way to your stomach. Let your lower stomach expand to receive the breath.
As you exhale, focus on your breath leaving your body, letting your stomach retract first.
After you have mastered this, focus on expanding your mid-belly, and then, after that, your upper belly.

, Stress causes a bevy or physical and mental issues, and can really do a number on your stomach. Unfortunately, stress is a part of most of our lives, and isn’t completely avoidable. You can manage it, though. Think about what situations, responsibilities, or people are causing you the most stress and then develop a plan to handle each differently.Your job may be a significant source of stress for you. Consider what exactly it is about your job that is causing you to feel this way. Be as specific as possible. This will help you develop a plan.
Finances may be causing you substantial stress. Again, isolate the issue and decide how to best resolve it.
Your relationship may be stressful, and once you figure out what it is that is causing you stress, you can speak to your partner about changes that need to be made, such as counseling or even them taking over the laundry and trash responsibilities.

, Progressive muscle relaxation is a great technique for isolating and calming particular muscle groups on your body. Your stomach, of course, because it’s the core of your body, is full of muscles and an excellent candidate for progressive muscle relaxation.You only need about 15 minutes per day and a quiet space to reap the rewards of this technique.

Then exhale, letting all the tension out of your muscles. Stay relaxed for 15 seconds.
Repeat as comfortable.
Make sure that you pay attention to how you’re feeling and stop if you feel any discomfort.

Don’t eat trigger foods.,
Avoid foods that cause gas.,
Eat smaller portions more frequently.,
Manage your weight.,
Take a yoga class.,
Take an over-the-counter medicine.",How to Relax Your Stomach3," There are some foods that may upset your stomach that seem perfectly harmless for other people. Pay attention to what your stomach is telling you after you eat, and if you don’t feel well, try omitting those foods that trigger you. Unless you see an allergist or have a specific list of foods to avoid from your physician, this is largely a trial-and-error effort and will take some time to figure out.

, Gas is a natural byproduct of any food that you don’t digest. Also, some foods naturally cause gas when they are being digested. In either case, limiting gas-causing foods may relax and calm your stomach.You might be lactose intolerant, which is much different than being allergic to milk. Lactose intolerance is pretty common and is the culprit behind many upset stomachs.
Some vegetables, such as cauliflower, onions, cucumbers, corn, and broccoli can cause a gassy stomach.
Other people find that starchy foods, like potatoes or pasta, upset their stomachs.

, Eating smaller portions is not only great for managing your weight, but is quite helpful in preventing stomach upset. It’s quite simple: the larger your portions, the more your stomach expands, the more it has to work to digest food, and the more gas you’ll produce from undigested foods. Eat smaller portions five or six times per day to help prevent an uncomfortable stomach., Your stomach makes up a significant portion of the core of your body, and is responsible for your abilities to sit upright and turn at the waist. Excess weight makes this more challenging for your abdominal muscle groups and can lead to stomach unrest. Also, most of your internal organs are housed in your core, and excess weight can cause your organs to get pushed or moved, causing stomach discomfort., Yoga has a host of benefits, including flexibility, increased blood flow, and a sense of emotional and cognitive calm. Additionally, yoga can help relax your stomach, whether it is upset from IBS or anxiety.

Apply muscle tension to your sore muscles.,
Relax stiff muscles by stretching.,
Practice low-intensity cardio.",How to Relax Muscles3," By gently squeezing and releasing your muscles, you can increase blood circulation and help relax muscles.For example, use your left hand to squeeze the deltoid muscle on your right arm. Take a slow, deep breath, and hold the pressure for five seconds. Then, release your hand and slowly exhale. Keep your arm relaxed so you don't cause stress to surrounding muscles. Keep doing this for about five minutes before moving on to another muscle., Before and after you perform physical activity, practice effective stretches. Each muscle group needs to be flexed or stretched for about 15 to 30 seconds in order to be effective. Be sure to stretch the muscle until you feel a good pull with no serious pain.Here are some good stretches to practice:Slowly roll your ankle and foot in circles.
Pull your foot towards you, and then point your foot back down while squeezing to work your calf muscle.
Raise your shoulders up to touch your ears, and then roll them back down and around.
Lean your head to each shoulder, and keep it there for 15 to 20 seconds. Be sure to stop when the pull becomes too intense.

, Performing light cardio is a good way to relax and loosen your muscles by increasing blood circulation.


Simply walk on a treadmill or outside at a quick pace for 15 to 20 minutes. Remember to keep the pace faster than a walk, but not too fast as the purpose is to relax your muscles and not cause any tension.

List the reasons why you avoid meditation.Knowing why you avoid meditating is half the battle for motivating yourself to start.,
Overcome the feeling that you don’t have time.Part of finding the motivation to meditate is realizing you don’t need as much time as you may think.You can also overcome the obstacle of feeling that you don’t have time if you meditate when it's least likely to be interrupted by other people or tasks.,
Handle forgetfulness by scheduling meditation in.You may want to meditate, but simply forget to do it with so many other things on your mind.,
Don’t let physical problems stop you.Even though most people picture the full lotus position when they picture someone meditating, there is no correct position for meditating.So, don’t let stiff knees, back problems, or other physical problems stop you from meditating.,
Address your fears of failing.You may be afraid that you won’t be ‘good’ at meditating or be able to keep it up.,
Meditate on your reasons for not meditating.If you have other reasons for avoiding meditation, analyze them and create your own solutions.",How to Find Motivation to Meditate1," By listing your obstacles, you can begin to address and overcome them.


Be honest with yourself when making your list. Don’t write, “I have no time” if the real reason is that you don’t know how to get started.
Creating an honest list of reasons can also help you see that you don’t have as many obstacles as you thought.
For example, you may think you have lots of obstacles to you meditating, but after writing them down, find out that you only have two or three.;
,


If you don't have time to spend an hour meditating, or you get frustrated easily, then try half an hour. Or ten minutes.
One true moment in meditation will be greater than one hour spent fidgeting and grumbling.
Try meditating first thing in the morning or last thing at night. At these times, you will probably be least busy and will find it easier to be motivated to meditate.
Moreover, early morning meditation may help you focus throughout the day, and late night meditation may help you sleep more deeply.

, While simply scheduling it in may not motivate you to meditate, at least you won't have anything else to do at that moment. And since you don’t have anything else to do, why not meditate?


Get out your calendar, planner, or agenda and write the time in for meditation each day or every few days.
Add it to your daily To Do list or set a daily alarm on your electronic device.
You may want to start by scheduling about half an hour for your meditation session and then increasing it over time.

, If you feel physically uncomfortable in one posture, then motivate yourself to meditate by trying another position.


If you are uncomfortable, you'll hardly be able to motivate yourself to practice meditation on a regular basis!
Try sitting on a pillow, cushion, or mat if you are going to meditate on the floor. You can lean against a wall as you sit if you need to.
Meditate while sitting in a chair. Sit back in the chair and make sure you feel comfortable before you begin meditating.
You can also meditate while lying down.

, But, you can motivate yourself to meditate if you remind yourself that in meditation, there is no such thing as failure.Or success, really. With meditation you are attached to the process, not to your results.


Tell yourself, “I can’t be good or bad at meditating. I can’t succeed at it or fail. But, I can do it.”
If you must think of things in terms of success or failure, then consider it a success anytime you attempt to meditate.
For example, if you can only meditate for a minute or two at a time, then give yourself credit for that!

, By thinking about your reasons you will be addressing obstacles to you meditating. And just by focusing your thinking on this one topic, you will actually be meditating.


For example, focus your mind on the thought, “I can find a way to overcome the obstacles to me meditating.”
Allow your thoughts and concerns about meditation to flow freely. Gently redirect your thoughts if they stray from the topic of meditating.
You might say to yourself, “I’m thinking about dinner. Let me think more about meditating.”
As you think of obstacles, ask yourself, “How can I overcome this obstacle?”

Muscles are meant to contract for short durations, then completely relax. However, performing similar movements over and over (due to athletics, weightlifting, cleaning the house, etc.) or sustaining certain postures while at work strains muscles fibers and causes them to remain contracted. As such, chronic muscle strains and knots respond well to light stretching because it relieves the tension, promotes blood flow and improves flexibility.As a general rule, hold the stretches (without bouncing) for about 30 seconds and do them at least three times daily until the achiness from the knot fades away.


While standing or sitting up straight, reach around the front of your body and grab the opposite elbow with your hand. Gently pull on the back of the elbow across your chest until you feel a stretch in the corresponding shoulder. Be sure to drop your shoulder away from your ear (don't hike it up). This stretch is great for the outer and rear muscles of the shoulder.
While standing or sitting up straight, reach behind your back and grab the wrist of the other hand (the one with the shoulder knot). Slowly pull down on the wrist until you feel a good stretch in the affected shoulder. This stretch is great for shoulder muscles that attach to your neck. To increase the stretch, you can drop your ear towards the opposite shoulder;
, Feeling for a knot in larger muscles like those in the shoulder is not too difficult. The knot should feel harder than the surrounding tissue and get achy with applied pressure. Unlike acute muscle injuries, there likely won't be obvious evidence of inflammation, swelling or redness. So feel around your shoulder and locate the knot, which is also called a trigger point.Once found, use a handheld vibrating massager over the knot for between five to 10 minutes and see if that works the knot out. You may need to apply more pressure for longer periods of time for noticeable results.


Although handheld massagers are commonly found in pharmacies and usually inexpensive, you can also use handheld wooden massage devices for working out knots. They may require more exertion, but they typically cost less.

, If your shoulder knot is closer to your shoulder blade and difficult to reach, then consider using a tennis ball to roll on. Place a tennis ball right beneath your knot and lie directly on it for about five minutes or so. This may be uncomfortable at first, but you should feel the knot slowly melt away.

, As noted above, muscle knots are a type of chronic injury and don't typically involve inflammation and sharp pain like acute muscle injuries do. As such, applying ice to muscle knots is not appropriate because you actually want more blood flow. Instead, apply moist heat to your shoulder muscle knot. Moist heat warms up the soft tissues (muscles, tendons and ligaments) and increases blood flow, which can be helpful for chronically tight muscles and knots.Great sources of moist heat include microwavable bags filled with grains (usually wheat or rice), herbs and/or essential oils. Warm the bag in the microwave for about two minutes or so and then apply the moist heat to the muscle knot for about 15 minutes at least three times daily.


Applying moist heat before exercise can help reduce muscle tension and pain, and also increase tissue extensibility.
Taking a warm bath also provides your muscles with moist heat. Try adding some Epsom salt (which is rich in magnesium) for even more muscle relaxing potential.
Avoid applying dry heat from traditional heating pads because it dehydrates soft tissues and increases the risk of further injury.
If your gym has a steam room, try spending some time relaxing there, as this is another good source of moist heat.

, Muscle relaxants (such as cyclobenzaprine) can be helpful for muscle spasms and knots because they release the tension in muscles. However, when you take medications orally (through the mouth) their effects are not limited to the problematic area. As such, muscle relaxants can cause strange sensations in some users because they reduce muscle contractions throughout the body. If your muscle knot is particularly achy, then non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen or aspirin might be more effective and cause fewer side effects.


Some of these medications can be hard on your stomach, kidneys and liver, so it's best not to take them for more than two weeks.Regardless, of what type of medication you choose, take them on a full stomach.
Always follow the instructions on the medication's package or ask your doctor for clear instructions on the appropriate dosing regimen.
Try applying a pain-relieving cream such as Icy-Hot or Bengay directly over the problem area.

, If your shoulder knot is obviously not caused by playing sports or working out, then consider how your work station/desk might be involved. For example, if your computer, desk or chair isn't positioned properly for your size it can put strain on your shoulders, neck and mid-back (between your shoulder blades). While sitting at your desk and looking straight ahead your eyes should be level with the top 1/3 of your monitor; your forearms should be close to parallel with the floor when typing and supported by stable arm rests; your elbows should be within a few inches from your sides; and your feet should be placed flat on the floor.If your arm position is too high or low due to the level of your desk or chair, then your risk of shoulder problems is greater.
To prevent shoulder strain, minimize overhead work by using a taller ladder or getting closer to your task.
Don't cradle the phone between your neck and shoulder. Use a headset or speakerphone setting instead.
If you spend a lot of time in the car commuting, this may contribute to your shoulder pain. Try keeping your hands low on the steering wheel with your palms downwards., If using a vibrating massager or tennis ball is ineffective at working out your shoulder knot, then consider seeing a professional massage therapist. A deep tissue massage is helpful for chronic strains and knots because it reduces muscle spasm and tension, stimulates blood circulation and promotes relaxation.Start with a 30-minute massage session, focusing on your sore shoulder and surrounding areas (lower neck and mid back). Allow the massage therapist to go as deep into the muscle fibers as you can tolerate.


The massage therapist may do some trigger point therapy, which involves pressing a thumb or tip of an elbow into the knot to get the muscle fibers to release. It can be painful but effective, so trust in the therapist's experience and knowledge.
Always drink lots of purified water immediately following a massage so that any inflammatory by-products and lactic acid is flushed out of your body. Failure to do so might result in a mild headache or soreness the next day.

, Acupuncture is an ancient healing technique that involves sticking thin needles into specific points within the skin / muscle in efforts to reduce pain and promote healing.The procedure is not particularly painful because it triggers the release of natural painkillers (called endorphins) and treatments last anywhere from 15 – 45 minutes for most musculoskeletal problems. Acupuncture for shoulder injuries can be very effective, especially if it's done shortly after you notice the symptoms.


A single acupuncture treatment may not completely get rid of your shoulder knot, so consider at least three treatments before your render judgement on its effectiveness.
Keep in mind that the acupuncture points that can relieve your muscle knot are not all located in the shoulder — some can be in distant areas of the body.
Acupuncture is practiced by a wide variety of medical professionals including some physicians, chiropractors, naturopaths and physiotherapists — whoever you choose should be NCCAOM certified.

, Chiropractors are musculoskeletal specialists who focus on establishing normal motion and function within muscles and joints of the spine and related areas, such as the shoulder. If your shoulder knot is closer to your shoulder blade or neck, then there's a good chance that your mid-back or neck is also involved. A chiropractor is trained in manual techniques to stretch tight muscles, release knots and adjust involved joints. Joint adjustments often elicit ""popping"" or ""cracking"" sounds, which aren't painful. An interesting sequel of a joint adjustment is that it relaxes all surrounding / related muscles almost immediately


Although one chiropractic treatment can sometimes completely dissolve your shoulder knot, it's likely that a few treatments will be needed to notice significant results.
Other medical professionals who perform joint adjustments include some Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) (also known as osteopathic physicians), Doctors of Medicine (MD), physiotherapists, and non-physician osteopaths.
Health insurance policies do not all cover chiropractic services, so you may have to pay out of pocket for treatments.

, If your shoulder knot is not resolved with home care, professional massage therapy or chiropractic treatments, then you need to consider some form of shoulder rehabilitation guided by a physiotherapist. Your family physician can refer you to a physiotherapist, who can show you specific stretches and strengthening exercises to rehabilitate your involved shoulder muscles.The therapist may utilize machines, free weights, rubber bands and/or exercise balls to strengthen your shoulder so it can withstand the rigors of your sport or work environment.


Physiotherapists are also trained to treat muscle knots with therapeutic ultrasound or electronic muscle stimulation if necessary.
Physical rehabilitation is typically required 2-3x per week for 4-8 weeks to significantly impact chronic shoulder issues.
Good general strengthening activities for your shoulders include rowing, swimming, push-ups and pull-ups.

Practice concentration meditation.,
Train with reflective meditation.,
Learn mindfulness meditation.,
Try heart-centered meditation.,
Discover guided meditation.",How to Understand Different Types of Meditation1," Concentration meditation is the foundation of all the other types of meditation. Meditation works best when you strengthen your concentration to the point of cutting out all distractions, or intense focus on nothingness. Reaching this level allows your mind to be calm and to move beyond your sense of self. Once attained, you can use it for wellness and a positive outlook.One of the methods to practice this type of mediation is to concentrate on a single object like an image, sound, or even your own breath. By consistently returning to focus on the object, the mind develops the capacity to remain calm.
Different types of popular concentration meditations are transcendental, zen, om, shine or Samadhi, and chakra meditation.;
, Reflective meditation, or analytical meditation, stimulates the power of dramatic change by providing you with great conviction and strength to reorder your life ways. This type of meditation requires “disciplined thinking.” In this case, a question, theme, or topic is chosen to contemplate for analysis. It is okay to let your mind wander for a short time, but it is vital that you bring your thought back to the reflection to make your mind stronger.It would be a good idea to master concentration meditation first since this type requires a higher degree of concentration and contemplation.
Typical questions you can focus on are: “Who am I?” “What is the true purpose of my life?” “What is my role in the universe?” or “How can I help remove the suffering of others?”

, Mindfulness mediation is a combination of concentration and open awareness. It emphasizes the cultivation of highly receptive attention toward any object or action within your sphere of influence. It is simply being “mindful,” or “paying attention” to your surroundings. Practitioners claim the benefits provide pain relief and helps support sufferers of anxiety and depression.This is the most popular meditation type in the Western Hemisphere.
You practice this meditation type by concentrating on an object such as breath, thoughts, feelings, or sounds but not as narrow as in concentration meditation. Instead, there is allowance for simultaneous awareness of other phenomena in your surroundings.
This meditation practice can be adapted to daily routines such as eating, walking, driving, or performing household chores. This adaptation removes all rigorous contemplative training.
Mindful meditation is often associated with the Theravada Buddhist practice of vipassana, or “insight meditation,” but other techniques such as deep-breathing, body scan, visualization, mindful breathing, sitting meditation, and walking meditation now exist.

, Heart-centered meditation, or heat chakra meditation, is performed to remove negative energy and release your fears and sadness. As your heart heals, your mind will embrace loving kindness and compassion, and encourage you to help heal the hearts of others.Find a quiet place, set your posture, and focus on your heart while you calmly and slowly inhale and exhale. Concentrate on connecting your heart to the heart of another person you feel compassion for.
Try this type of meditation when grieving or when suffering from great personal loss. This will put your mind at ease and heal your heart.

, Guided, or sometimes called creative or visualization, meditation focuses on cultivating and strengthening various qualities of your mind. Qualities such as appreciation, joy, compassion, patience, empathy, love, gratitude, compassion, humility, fearlessness, and tenderness can be the areas of your concentration.Beginners start with a teacher who provide auditory guidance that encourages the elicitation of certain images, affirmations, states (such as peacefulness), or desired experiences.
This type of meditation is popular in western culture as a way to promote health, well-being, and as a visualization of a successful outcome to a surgery or competition.

Ask your doctor to recommend the best physical therapist for your condition.,
Call your insurance to ask how many visits are covered.,
Ask the physical therapy office if you can have a discounted rate, if you are paying out of pocket.",How to Make the Most of Your Physical Therapy1," Many people have to decide based on who their insurance will cover; however, some physical therapists specialize in certain conditions and can offer expertise that an insurance-covered physical therapist cannot. Choose based on what you can afford and how important your timely recovery is.;
, Many insurance plans have caps on physical therapy treatments, from 10 to 35. After severe injuries, you may be able to apply to the insurance company for more treatments, if they are absolutely necessary.

, Insurance companies often get a discounted rate, so they may afford you the same price. Ask the physical therapist directly, rather than the secretary, because it is the physical therapist that is agreeing to alter their wages.

Develop your motivation and inspiration first.,
Use friendly ground-rules.,
Practice styles that shape the experience.,
Try this fun experiment to learn about centering.,
Take your time.,
Let the body be when you meditate.,
Allow the mind to be.,
Avoid trying to center yourself.,
Continue to let go.",How to Center Yourself in Meditation," Where most meditations fail is because the motivation is absent. Often people will try to meditate without motivation and it invariably stays dry and uninteresting. Simple ways to build motivation include reflecting on the benefits of meditation, such as the sense of ease and rejuvenation, or recollect on an inspiring person who has good qualities.


The motivation and inspiration serves as a ""glue"" to keep things together, so it can be very hard to meditate without it.;
, To keep your meditation together so it centers more easily, use ground-rules such as determining to stay in the present moment or to stay with your area of focus. What keeps your mind on the object (such as the breath) is a deep sense of affection for it, so an important ground-rule is always to respect your meditation practice as well as those who teach and inspire you.


A good trick is to relinquish the distracting thoughts or all your worries and tiredness from the day as a gift to your meditation, which properly speaking is a gift to yourself while you relax. You can visualise putting them in a box and gift wrapping it, or imagine putting them away in a filing cabinet so you can close the door on it, but pull it back out when you need it later.

, Meditations such as loving kindness and compassion not only shape the mind itself, but also train you to shape your experience. This is so when you see the mind drifting off, or some unresolved issues rear their ugly head, you have a skilled way to resolve them or move around them.

, Stand with your feet shoulder width apart, feet at a comfortable angle. Stand with your hands at a comfortable, well balanced position. Now close your eyes and relax, and stay in the position for at least 5 minutes while watching your breath. This standing meditation can teach you a lot about centering, since you will fall over very quickly if you are not aware and able to let the body look after itself.


This shows that your meditation will ""fall over"" and not go very deep if you try to stay still. This control actually will make you struggle and wobble even more! You have to step back and allow the body balance itself - which it does all the time.

, In most cases, deep meditation can require a good few hours before the foundation is laid down, certainly there are times the mind will settle and center very quickly, but these can be quite rare and something the mind does on its own so its not something you can repeat easily.


It also takes a long time to develop the skills to 'drive' yourself into deeper states, so its generally best to let the mind find its own levels. Going on meditation retreats can be a great experience and opportunity to develop that experience.

, Let the body just be the body, feelings just feelings and sounds just be sounds. Spend your time preparing your meditation, then be kind to it by letting it relax on its own time.


This is part of the process that makes meditation so fascinating. To center the mind, the body gradually fades away because its no longer as important - it's not in any stressful situation so its not calling your attention to it. You can begin by paying attention to the body's needs at the beginning, then when its settled you can place more interest in your meditation object.

, Essentially, this means you have the reflection that if you don't stay with your meditation object so your mind can relax and settle, you will either feel tired, get frustrated or get bored as if your time is not being productive. The beauty of the mind is it very easily looks after itself so it does not need to be interacted with. This in many ways makes meditation much easier because its far less work.

, This may same contradictory, but what basically happens is this additional activity - the trying or the intention to center - will actually get in the way because it has created additional activities in the mind and you can often try to measure your progress to see how centered you are. This basically un-does all your good work so far. To center, you have to go the other way and reduce the activities.


This is actually an extension of the experiment above - if you try to keep your body still, it will move, if you try to keep your mind centered, it will go all over the place.

, The centered mind is just like a flower, it is quite soft, delicate and fragile - it's easy to knock it around at the early and intermediate stages. So the things that knock it around have to be allowed to fade away first because that centered, unified mind on its own will never be able to overpower all the stuff that goes on that we constantly engage with. When they have completely faded away, then the centered mind becomes the strongest thing and can last a long time as a beautiful, stable and enriching life experience.

Practice meditation.",How to Relax Muscles4," It is important for everyone to get the recommended amount of sleep for their age, regardless of a busy schedule. Teenagers should shoot for about eight hours of sleep per night, and adults should try to get at least seven hours of sleep. Proper sleep allows your muscles to relax and heal after a long day., Taking slow and deep breaths can help you relieve muscle tension by spreading oxygen throughout the body. Slowly inhale and exhale on a 4:4 second count. During your deep breaths, picture any stress or tension leaving each part of your body., Meditation works to mentally reduce muscle tension and stress. While you can practice meditation at any time of the day, the evening hours can be very beneficial as they will prepare your body for rest. Find a quiet area where you will not be disturbed. You can either cross your legs and sit up straight, or you can lie flat on your back as you concentrate on your breathing by taking slow, deep breaths.Let go of any stress that may be on your mind, and visualize your muscle tension leaving your body. Work your way through your entire body, focusing on one body part at a time.

Give yourself permission to meditate.,
Create a ‘meditation zone’.A meditation zone is a space in your home dedicated to meditation.,
Play soothing music.,
Remind yourself why you want to meditate.You can motivate yourself to meditate and make meditation a part of your lifestyle if you remind yourself why want you to do it.",How to Find Motivation to Meditate2," You may feel that you could or should do something else with your time other than meditate. But, if you treat meditation like it is a part of a healthy lifestyle then you will find yourself more motivated to do it.


You deserve to be peaceful as much as you deserve to eat, sleep, or breathe. It is a part of who you are.
Furthermore, the world around you—–your family, your friends, your companion animals, even strangers—–deserve for you to be peaceful, too.
”Tell yourself, “It’s okay for me to take the time to meditate. This is a part of being healthy. It’ll help me be calmer and more peaceful. “

, You can even tell the rest of the household that this area is off limits during the times you are using it for meditation. Having a dedicated space that you enjoy can help you find the motivation to meditate.Use scented candles, incense, or aromatherapy fragrance makers to make your meditation zone appealing.
Add light as part of the enjoyment. Use low-key colored lights or pretty hanging lights to create an atmosphere that draws you to this area for ""me time"".
By making the space where you meditate a special place, in time you will become aware that you are calmer here, because it will be associated with peace and reflection.

, Listening to relaxing music playing quietly in the background can help you relax and get into the ‘meditation mood’. And the more you are in the mood to meditate, the more motivated you will be to meditate.


Create a meditation playlist of your own made up of music that calms you and helps you be more peaceful.
Find a relaxing channel or playlist on an internet radio or video provider by searching for the term ‘meditation music’.
If you can, wear headphones, as this also allows you to block out any other noises and distractions.
Don’t allow the music or sounds to become a distraction. You want to focus on meditating, not the music., So keep the positive effects of meditation and your personal reasons for trying it in mind as a way to motivate yourself.


For example, tell yourself, “One benefit is that it can help me remain more aware and focused. That will make all those tasks I have to perform much easier!
Or, you might remind yourself, “Meditation can help me appreciate time and learn to manage it better. Then I’ll feel less rushed and busy.”
Remind yourself if you want to use meditation as a way to think about a specific issue or question in depth. You might say, “Meditation is the way that I am going to think through this problem.”
Think about your spiritual and religious reasons for wanting to meditate. For example, remind yourself that you want to contemplate your higher power and become insightful.
If you feel emotionally or physically disturbed, then you may have some mental or emotional issues you need to address. Meditation may help.

You don't want to nod off in the middle of your session., Loose-fitting clothes are best; don't wear anything too tight, as this will limit your movement. And don't forget to take off your shoes so you can properly tense and relax your feet., Often, when people are very relaxed they become chilly. Have a blanket or sheet nearby that you can drape over yourself if you get cold.

Practice pranayama breathing technique.,
Train with diaphragmatic breathing.,
Engage in mindful breathing.,
Connect through chakra breathing technique.",How to Understand Different Types of Meditation2," This breathing technique is considered to be an exact science that focuses on the regulation of prana (breathe) by stopping inhalation and exhalation. In a connected way, controlling your inhales and exhales enables you to better control your subtle prana, which in turn, allows you to control your mind.Controlling your mind through Pranayama removes impurities from your body. To achieve this level you have to practice daily in a quiet location free from external distractions.

, With diaphragmatic breathing, you will want continuously inhale and exhale without pause. This is the opposite of the Pranayama breathing technique.The diaphragm is the efficient muscle used in breathing. By strengthening the diaphragm through this breathing technique, you will decrease the rate of breathing, oxygen demand, and the exertion of less energy to breathe bringing stillness to your body.
Since breathing is interconnected to the nervous system as well as the mind, practice diaphragmatic breathing in the early morning and just prior to sunset for maximum effect.

, The primary goal of mindful breathing is to practice focusing on your own breathing. You must focus on every single inhalation and every single exhalation. This is known as mindfulness-of-breathing. In doing so, you will sharpen your concentration.If you have trouble starting out, try counting your breaths to get your mind in the right place.
When you begin, start by gently moving your attention towards the process of breathing. Choose to concentrate on each breath as it happens or on the rise and fall of your chest or abdomen. The point is to understand what it is truly like to breathe without altering the natural process.
When finished, try to stay connected to the present moment and expand your awareness to the environment around you. Contemplate your experience and remember how you feel at this very moment.

, Chakra breathing is designed to assist and improve the flow of energy throughout your body. This is possible because there are seven chakras located within the body. By concentrating on each of the chakras, you will be able to move energy throughout your body by connecting the chakra with your breath. This will create harmony, balance, and positive energy flow, keeping your body healthy both physically and emotionally.The seven chakra are: root chakra on the base of spine; sacral chakra situated in the lower abdomen; solar plexus chakra situated in the solar plexus; heart chakra located at the center of the chest; throat chakra in the throat; third eye chakra located at the center of the forehead; and the crown chakra at the top of the head.

Gain enlightenment.,
Reduce stress.,
Improve concentration.",How to Understand Different Types of Meditation3," Meditation is a practice meant to discover the reality of the mind as it is and to help the world to remove negativity. It is possible to replace negativity with positive thoughts and actions, and to achieve physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual change with all those you come into contact with.Meditation also makes you realize how important the construction of your body is and what goes in and out of it. As a result, people who practice meditation tend to eat healthier. They recognize the foods they are putting into their body and how it can either maintain or disrupt balance.
Another product from meditation is self-awareness. Not only do you recognize what you put into your body but also who you are. Meditation allows you to clear your mind of the day’s busy activities, anger, stress, and anxiety, making you more comfortable with yourself.

, Meditation allows you take control over your body, especially your own nervous system and emotions. In a world full of agitation, meditation calms the mind and brings inner peace.Certain types of meditation specifically associate with reducing stress. New studies have shown that meditation can help people deal with the symptoms of social anxiety disorders.
Meditation stimulates brain signaling in the left side of the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with happy emotions. While, at the same time, decreases activity in the right side where negative emotions originate. This also improves your overall well-being.

, Since concentration is the foundation of meditation, it only makes sense that you will drastically improve this if you practice daily. People have claimed that not only do they have better focus and energy but they also multitask better because of the improvement in concentration.Recent studies suggest that it takes less than one month of practicing meditation to significant improvement in focus and memory. Since a vital part of meditation is the strong focus on an object or idea, it makes sense that concentration improves significantly.

See if you need to make a major life change to really loosen up.",How to Loosen Up," One of the biggest reasons some people have a hard time loosening up is because they want to be in control of every situation. They want to be able to predict exactly what’s going to happen and when. They want to know when they will succeed, how their boss/best friend/parents will react, and they want to believe that they know exactly what they have to do to get what they want. Unfortunately, life doesn’t work that way. It’s filled with surprises and curve balls, both good and bad. If you really want to loosen up, then you have to get ready to expect the unexpected.


It takes baby steps to get here. One way you can start is to start thinking of the multiple outcomes that can happen. Let’s say you’re up for a promotion. Instead of assuming you’ll get it, think of the different options and how you’ll react to them – you may get the promotion, or you may be told that you will get it pretty soon, or you may be told that you need to work harder if you really want that promotion. Whatever happens, if you’re prepared in advance, you’ll be less freaked out when “the unexpected” happens.
There are some things you really can’t prepare for in advance. Maybe you and your boyfriend are on your way to a romantic getaway when your car breaks down. Yeah, it sucks, but sometimes, you have to learn to laugh at the things you can’t control.
Let go of being a micro-planner. If you obsessively plan every fifteen-minute block of your day, then you are guaranteed to be frustrated and disappointed when something doesn’t go your way.;
, This is another thing that may be in the way of you loosening up. You may expect everyone to be on their best behavior 24/7. You may think that your teachers, your boss, your friends, your significant other, or anyone else in your life is able to read your mind all the time. You may think that the world should give you what you deserve. Well, if you want to loosen up, then you have to learn to accept the imperfections of the world around you; if you want to be able to determine how everyone around you should act, then you should go play the SIMS.


Once you stop expecting people to act the way you want them to act, you’ll be pleasantly surprised when they exceed your expectations.
People aren’t perfect. Sometimes, they will be rude, insensitive, and immature. And that’s okay. This goes back to the “letting go of control” thing – let go of your high expectations of everything around you, and you are guaranteed to loosen up.
This includes letting go of the unrealistic standards you set for yourself. If you expect yourself to be a CEO/Oscar-winning actress/best-selling author by the time you turn 25, then yeah, you are bound to be tense and disappointed when it doesn’t happen for you.

, People who are uptight freak out anytime something they have planned doesn’t go perfectly because they made a mistake, big or small. You have to learn to embrace failure as a learning experience, instead of punishing yourself for not doing something as well as you could have. Mistakes are a part of life and life would be no fun if we all completed our tasks like robots. If you’ve made a mistake, think about what you learned from it, what you would have done differently, and how you can use this knowledge in the future.


People who can’t loosen up are so stuck in expecting themselves to be perfect that they feel like huge losers if they misstep somewhere down the line.

, People who can’t loosen up get hung up on every little thing someone does wrong and every little annoying personality trait that someone around them possesses. Sure, Katie got too drunk at your birthday party, or your lab partner forgot to do his part of the project, and that sucks, but how much energy do you want to spend wishing other people acted differently? The answer is, no energy at all. Learn to take a deep breath, accept that it takes all kinds of people to make the world, and move on with your day.


If someone is really partaking in irritating behavior that is driving you crazy, take some deep breaths, take a bathroom break if you need to, and learn to look past it. The worst thing you can do is to tell everyone within a 25-mile radius about how annoying the person’s behavior is; talking about it will only make you look uptight and is guaranteed to make you feel worse.
Try to think about the scheme of things. Will Bill’s antics or Mallory’s loudmouth really annoy you even twelve hours from right now? If the answer is no, then why not stop letting it annoy you this moment?

, This can also help you loosen up a bit. Before you go into a situation, make a list of all of the different things that can happen, instead of the one thing you expect to happen, and you’ll be better off for it. Let’s say you’re throwing yourself a birthday party. Best case scenario: everyone shows up, it’s the best party ever, people will be talking about it for years, etc. But more realistically, some things are bound to go wrong: maybe a few guests who promised to come won’t make it, a few people will have five tequila shots too many and may fall into your bookshelf, and maybe your crush will act lame. The more scenarios you have in your head, the less likely you are to freak out if something doesn’t happen according to plan.


That’s not to say that you shouldn’t keep up a positive attitude and expect the best. But if you’re aware of the other possibilities, you’re much less likely to freak out and cause a ruckus if something less-than-great happens.

, This is another quality that people who have trouble loosening up all share. You may have a hard time laughing in the face of crisis, understanding when someone is just teasing you, or even understanding your own foibles because you think that you are a very serious, important, busy person who cannot be bothered to point out his or her own imperfections. Make a list of your flaws and learn to poke fun at them! It’s better that you realize what your weaknesses are than to have someone else point them out.


The key is not to be so darn sensitive. If you act like you’re going to cry or get upset about every little thing someone says about you, then no one will feel like they can relax around you. You don’t want to be that person who stops people from having a little harmless fun, do you?

, Another trick to being able to relax is to understand where all of those pesky people who are bothering you are coming from. So Marcia got too drunk at your birthday party and tried to make out with your lamp. Maybe that’s annoying, but remember that Marcia got dumped that week and she’s been acting a little off ever since. Maybe Mark didn’t turn in his project on time; remember that he has been taking care of his sick mother and has been a little under the weather. Humans are, well, human, and if you think about some of the reasons that people may not act the way you want them to act, then you’ll be able to accept their behavior more readily.


This doesn’t mean that there’s always a great reason for someone to act out of line. But more often than not, if you dig deeper, you’ll be able to find an explanation for it. And that’s what people who need to relax live on – explanations.

, You can still think of yourself as the smart one or the serious one and relax and have some fun once in a while. Go bowling. Play charades. Get a little drunk on wine and giggle with your girlfriends. Try on silly costumes. Run around the beach. Do something that requires 0% of your brain power. It’ll feel good. Let those worries, ambitions, and problems go and just live in the moment. Living in the moment and being fun and silly will help you be a happier and less tense person over all.


Be spontaneous. You don’t have to plan a time for having brainless fun. If you’re hanging out with friends and suddenly don’t feel like talking about your stock options, then get silly!
Do something completely new. Take a salsa class, go to a comedy show, or have fun putting temporary tattoos on your friends’ faces. If it would appeal to a fifth grader, even better!

, This is key to loosening up. If someone teases you, makes fun of you, or makes a joke as a response to a comment you’ve made, you have to learn to laugh it off – and maybe even to give it right back! If you can never take a joke directed toward you, even if it’s harmless, then you will have a reputation for being uptight and no fun to be around. Laugh at yourself, agree with the person, and then dish it right back. If the joke is really meant to be hurtful, then you have the right to be upset, but in most cases, people are just trying to keep you on your toes and to let you know that nobody’s perfect!

, This doesn’t mean you should break into a car or steal an iPod. But it does mean that you should stop being so obsessed about sticking to the rules that you go crazy if you see somebody breaking them. Don’t follow every assignment to a T. It’ll feel good when you find yourself doing things your way instead of doing what other people want you to do 100% of the time.


And if you’re hanging out with friends who are acting slightly reckless – drinking too much, speeding a little, being annoying at the drive-thru – then yeah, you can be the person who says, “Stop it, you guys!” or you can roll with it and see that nothing bad will happen.

, Sometimes you just need to take a break in the middle of all the action to really relax. If you feel like you’re as tight as a drum in the middle of work, school, or even a fun session with friends, then you just need to cool it for a few minutes, to step outside, to look at cute photos of cats, to call your mom, or just to do whatever it is you think will help you feel normal again. There’s nothing wrong with taking a break from the action, and it does not mean that you’re showing weakness. If stepping out for a bit in the middle of a tense time will help you loosen up, then go for it!


If you’re really a type-A, hardworking person, then you may feel like you won’t get a moment of rest until whatever task is at hand gets done, but in reality, if you take half an hour away from your task, you may be able to get it done more easily and with a more level head.

, One of the reasons you may find it so hard to loosen up is because your body is chronically exhausted without you realizing it. If you get enough rest, you’ll have more energy and peace of mind for facing the day, and won’t let the most basic challenges upset you. Aim to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep and to go to bed around the same time every night and wake up around the same time every morning. Limit caffeine after noon so you don’t feel wired and restless when it’s time for bed. These small changes can make a big impact on how you see the world.


If you’re really feeling stressed out in the middle of the day, don’t underestimate the power of a good 15-20 minute power nap to helping reboot your system.

, Just stepping outdoors, getting some fresh air, and walking around for 20 minutes a day can make you feel more relaxed, more at peace, and more at one with the world. Make sure to go outside at least 2-3 times a day if you work from home or just if you tend to spend most of your time at home. You’ll be surprised by how relaxed and invigorated you feel just from being outdoors, and how much less the small stuff will start to bother you.

, This is a big one. If you want to be able to loosen up and not be so obsessed with being perfect, then you have to hang out with other people who are much more chill than you are. They don’t have to be guitar-playing hippies, but they should be people who are a lot less obsessed with the small details of life who know how to be spontaneous and to kick back whenever they feel like it. These people will rub off on you and you will feel more relaxed in no time.


And on the opposite end of the spectrum, hanging out with people who are super uptight, who are obsessed with perfect grades, the perfect career, etc, are bound to make you even more uptight, too.

, Though organizing your desk or cleaning out your closet may not sound like the path to a more relaxed life, you will see that, if you feel more organized and on top of your game, that you’ll actually feel like a more relaxed person. You may find it hard to loosen up because you can’t find anything in your closet or because you keep losing important documents, or just because of all the clutter in your life. So, take some time (maybe just 30 minutes a day) to start sorting out your space, and you’ll be amazed by how much lighter you’ll feel.

, Getting some exercise will help you burn steam, will give your body a positive outlet, and will give you the energy you need to face the day. Make a goal of exercising for at least 30 minutes a day, whether you’re running, biking, rock climbing, or swimming, and you’ll see that you’ll be able to burn off a lot of that negative, pent-up energy. Get a buddy to exercise with so you can laugh while you burn some calories.


If you’re super stressed out all the time, you may feel like you don’t have time for things like exercise. But if you can move your schedule around, you’ll find that you’ll be able to carve out the time for your mind and your body.

, Go to a massage parlor and take care of that tension in your neck, back, and body. If you’re uncomfortable about this, then get a trusted friend to give you a massage. It will definitely help you relax, especially in moments of high stress or tension. Don’t knock it until you try it. Before you know it, you may be signing up for weekly massages!

, Yoga has been proven to have countless benefits on your mind and body, one of which is helping people relax and live in the moment. You can take a power yoga class if you want more of a workout or a more calming and meditation-focused class if you want to focus on your mind. Just practicing 2-3 times a week can really help you loosen up and feel more centered. If you really enjoy the classes, then you may even end up practicing on your own.

, Blast your music and dance alone in your room or get into a spontaneous dance contest with your friends. Whether you’re hanging out at home, hitting up the clubs, or even enrolled in a dance class, dancing can help you get rid of some of that negative energy, learn to experiment and not take yourself so seriously, and can help you generally unwind and have fun.

, Just 10-20 minutes of mediation a day can help you be more loose and relaxed throughout the day. Find a quiet place in your home, take a seat, close your eyes, and focus on your breath. Feel the breath going in and out of your body as you relax your body one part at a time. Ignore any noises and distractions in your way and focus on reaching a calm, happy place. When you’re done, you’ll be much more equipped for facing the challenges ahead of you.

, For many people, the routine of brewing a cup of tea or coffee is just as relaxing as the drink itself. So, partake in this morning ritual to get your day started on a calm, relaxing note. Make sure not to overdo it on the caffeine, though, or you will actually make yourself more tense.

, Laughter really is the best medicine and it can definitely help you loosen up, no matter how bad of a day you’re having. Make a habit of laughing more during your daily life, whether it means watching a comedy, watching silly videos on YouTube, hanging out with your funniest friend more, or catching a comedy show. Though it may sound silly to “force” yourself to laugh, this will help you take any challenges with a grain of salt and to be able to stand back and laugh at your foibles instead of feeling tense whenever something goes wrong.

, Maybe your job is sucking all of the life out of you. Maybe your three best friends are neurotic basket cases who have turned you into a complete worrywart for no reason. Maybe you’ve spent way too much effort doing exactly what your parents expect you to do and feel like you have no wiggle room to do what you really want to do. If changing your attitude and making a series of small changes just isn’t working for you, then you may have to stop and think about any big changes that may be necessary to your future happiness.


Make a list of all of the things that are leading you to be stressed and unhappy. If you notice a pattern and see that most of them are coming from one source, then it may be time to make a big move. This may be scary, but in the end, you’ll be a happier person because of it!

, Think about releasing your muscles down into the floor rather than forcing them to relax. Force and relaxation do not go together.

Steal time.,
Find a quiet place to sit.,
Eliminate distractions.,
Try DIY sensory deprivation.,
Just sit.,
Try clearing your mind and ""watching"" your thoughts.,
Find a meditative activity.,
Try progressive muscle relaxation.",How to Do Nothing1," Life gets loud, stressful, and tense. When you're ready to pull the trigger on some serious leisure, set a block of time and keep it. Doing nothing on a regular basis is very healthy for your mind, body, and emotional life, especially if you find that you're really wearing yourself thin. Every now and then, it's ok.


If you're feeling stressed and overwhelmed, you don't need to set aside hours and hours of nothingness, which would just be silly. Steal 15 minutes every now and then, and you can seriously de-stress.;
, Go somewhere you can escape, zone out, and find some peace. If you live in a small apartment, set aside a corner of a larger room with floor pillows, a softly scented candle and maybe a cozy throw. Wherever it is, make sure you can feel comfortable and calm.


You don't have to be a monk sitting on top of a mountain in Japan to find peace and quiet. Hit up a quiet corner of the public park, or set out a deck chair in your backyard. Park your car in an empty lot and just sit there.

, If you're looking at your phone, you're doing something. Turn off your phone, computer, radio, television and any other means of sending or receiving calls or messages. These distractions will only keep you from enjoying the nothing.


It can be nice to set an alarm, if necessary, so you can remind yourself when your period of ""nothing time"" is over.

, Some people pay good money for the experience of sensory deprivation, which is basically doing nothing in a dark tank set at your body temperature. While you might not be able to get it perfect, you can approximate the experience.


Draw a warm bath and wait until it gets as close as possible to your body temperature. Turn off all the lights, put some earmuffs on, and try to float in the tub for a while. Trippy stuff.

, Zazen, commonly shortened ""zen"" is a kind of meditation known as ""just sitting"" meditation. If you ask Zen monks what they're doing during meditation, they would say, ""Just sitting."" There is no goal to sitting meditation, no end result.Doing nothing is sometimes a lot harder than doing something, and one of the central learnings of Zen is to just ""do"" whatever it is you're doing. When you're eating lunch, just eat lunch. When you're sitting, just sit. When you're collating data at work, just collate data at work.

, Meditation is not thinking. Meditation is allowing your thoughts to occur, unaffected. Let your thoughts of work, worries, family go - not by simply letting them go, but by watching them leave from a distance. Doing this not only allows your body to do nothing but your mind as well.


Imagine that you're pulling the camera back away from your thoughts, watching them from a distance. Who's doing this watching? Keep pulling the camera back until you can't. Look for stillness.
Don't be discouraged if you find your mind quite active in meditation. Buddhist monks dedicate their entire lives to freeing their minds. For now, shed your worries as much as you can and revel in feeling lighter and less encumbered.

, While this may not be ""nothing,"" strictly speaking, some people find it easier to avoid distressing thoughts if their mind is focused on a rote activity. Try arranging a Zen garden, or stacking rocks, or engaging in a repetitive activity such as crocheting. Pay attention to only what your hands are doing, and don't allow other thoughts to intrude.

, This process can help you achieve deep relaxation while doing nothing. Focus on relaxing each muscle group, from your face to your feet, slowly and with regular, even breaths.

Prepare the couch potato spot.,
Prepare the sustenance.,
Prepare the couch distractions.,
Deal with the potential for distractions.,
Enjoy your sojourn on the couch.,
Bribe some servants.,
Exercise the couch potato way.,
Be a couch potato in moderation.",How to Be a Couch Potato," Choose the best place in the room for reclining in complete comfort. If there's competition for the best spot, reserve it, or do a deal to get it for your couch potato slouch time. Perfect places to sit include a recliner chair, beanbag, or (you knew it was coming) a couch.


Add cushions, pillows, blankets, and anything else that will increase your comfort level. Make it even more comfortable than it already is, but with minimal effort, of course!
Angle the couch for optimal TV viewing if it's not already in position.
Be sure to have the remote control (or controls) all within easy reach of your chosen spot. A TV guide is also a good item to keep handy.
It's a good idea to locate a small trash can near the couch so that you can toss packaging, lids, and anything else hassling you straight into it without having to get up. It makes cleaning up after your couch potato experience a breeze.;
, A couch slouch needs to be accompanied by snacks and drinks. Junk food is a couch potato's traditional fare but you don't have to stick to just chips, nuts, candies, and chocolate. You might also like unbuttered popcorn, veggie sticks and dips, pumpkin seeds, toast, and jam, etc. Basically, whatever you enjoy consuming in front of the TV is the best choice!


Drinks can range from water, juice, milk, and soda, to beer, wine, and spirits. If you've got a bar fridge nearby, keep them cool and handy. If not, find a helper willing to fetch for you when you run out of your favorite drink.

, While the main aim of being a couch potato is to watch TV, the occasional distraction is welcome. Stock up on celebrity magazines, comic books, graphic novels, handheld games machines, iPad or laptop for surfing at leisure, and maybe a pack or cards for a game of Solitaire. If you've got a Wii, Playstation, Xbox, or any other game device, make sure it's all in order and ready to play.


When surfing, places to find out key information about what you're watching include Hulu, IMDB, and Fancast, as well as the TV show's own homepage. The modern couch potato no longer has to lie there wondering ""who's that guy?!"" when a flick of the iPad placed right next to your couch can reveal all.
If you're not so keen to watch what's on TV, have a pile of DVDs already slotted in to go, or access to paid movies via your provider.
Have your favorite video games sorted and ready to play.

, If there are other members of the household wanting to use the same room or even couch, it's deal time. Negotiate your space for the duration of your couch potato relaxation and ask politely that they either don't disturb you, or join in. The more couch potatoes, the merrier, provided they're all on the same wavelength.


Turn off all phones; don't forget to unhook the landline.
Turn off or go invisible on your Facebook, Skype, and Gmail chat programs, and any other chat program that lets people know you're online. That way, unless you feel like chatting while being a couch potato, an occasional surf from the couch won't alert anyone to your presence.

, You've set everything up, removed the distractions, and settled in. Now it's time to enjoy your couch potato fest.



Turn on the TV. Flip through TV channels if you don't like what's on. Channel surfing can take up a good deal of time until it bores you. Give each show about 10 seconds to entertain you, and if it doesn't, just move onto the next one. If it does, watch until the show ends, or until you lose interest.
Munch on snacks and sip your drinks.
Play video games when the TV gets too boring. Or do both at the same time – watch TV and play a game.
Watch DVDs if you don't like the TV programming.
Snooze as and when you like.
Basically, don't do anything that requires much effort, or any effort at all. Take care not to play any video games that are too strenuous and require you to move too much!

, Siblings, friends, or housemates might be amenable to being bribed into fetching more food and drinks for you if you're lucky. Your luck will depend on who you ask and how, as well as what's in it for them. Be super nice and suck up to them; promise them something similar in return when they want to do the couch potato. Or just give in to their choice of TV for half an hour.


Consider training your dog to fetch your beer. No need to get up and Fido gets a workout inspire of your supine state.

, If you're feeling a bit guilty that you haven't been to the gym that day because you were just too pooped, try these couch potato exercises while continuing to watch TV:Lie across your couch, on your back. Bring one knee up to your chest, hold for 10 seconds, then release. Repeat three times with alternate legs.
Briefly stand up and hold your arms out to the sides. While watching TV, make eight big circles in one direction, then eight in the other direction.
While standing, raise one foot and use it to trace the letters of the alphabet in the air in front of you (use the couch arm to support you). Repeat with the other foot. Then lie on the floor and tense your thigh and abdominal muscles. Raise one leg about 6 inches (15 cm) off the ground, then lower. Repeat four to six times before switching to the other leg.
Get back on the couch now, you're probably exhausted.

, Obviously, following a couch potato lifestyle daily isn't conducive to good health, and a sedentary lifestyle without proper exercise and nutrition is the cause of numerous preventable health problems, including ones that can lead to early death.It's also a really bad message to send to any kids around you.However, a couch potato session undertaken now and then as part of lifestyle focused on a healthy diet and exercise won't do you any harm, and will improve your sense of well-being as a result of the pleasure and relaxation derived from it.


Make it a friends' affair. Socializing with people you care about and have fun with is better than health insurance.

This practice has been shown to positively effect mood, and to reduce anxiety and fatigue.You can use imagery along with deep breathing before you start to put yourself in a relaxed state.
Alternately, you can wait until you are relaxed and then imagine yourself in a safe, relaxing space to increase your sense of relaxation.

, Think of a real or imagined place where you feel safe, calm, and happy. There is no ""wrong"" place. It is, however, best to stick with a place once you choose it, as this makes reaching a relaxed state easier.Common safe places include:


A beach
The woods
A mountaintop
A sunny park
A spot you visited on vacation
Your favorite room in your house, past or present

, Feel the calmness as you imagine each detail. Use all of your senses, not just sight. For example, if your safe place were a sunny meadow, you might concentrate on:The colors – the green of the grass, the pure blue of the sky
The sounds – the buzz of bees, the trill of birdsong, the whistle of the wind in the grass
The sensations – the wind on your skin, the warm sun on your face, the grass under your arms
Smells – the clean air with a hint of grass and wildflowers

, When thoughts to arise, don't fight them. Gently return your focus to the details of the calm, relaxing space.


If you have difficulty ridding yourself of a thought, imagine putting an image of it on a TV screen, then use a remote control to turn it off.You can also imagine putting the image in a drawer and closing the drawer.

, You are completely relaxed, with no desire to be anywhere else, to do anything else. Your mind and body are at ease.

Practice looking busy.,
Volunteer for brainless tasks.,
Lie about how long it takes to do things.,
""Let the foreman find you."",
Let someone else do it.,
Take a long lunch.,
Play to your strengths.,
Fail in calculated ways.,
Get a job that's basically like doing nothing.",How to Do Nothing2," Get in the habit of making rushed runs to different rooms in your office, with a frowning look on your face, shuffling papers through your hands. When people see you, they'll think, ""Must be really busy.""


Always keep moving around when you're at work. If you're just sitting there doing nothing, someone will notice. But if you're all over the place, nobody will think to question whether or not you're doing something, or just wandering around.
If you're working on a computer, tilt your screen so nobody can see it and type furiously. Listen to music or podcasts instead.

, Does your boss need someone to sweep up the kitchen? Volunteer. Does somebody have to sit out back and sort boxes? Sounds good. The more brainless the task, the more like doing nothing it will be. The more stressful thinking required, the more difficult the job.


Alternatively, it may be better to never volunteer for anything. If you ever find yourself standing around on the clock, just keep standing there. That's good money.

, Scotty said it best on Star Trek: ""Tell the captain it's gonna take you four hours, so you can look like a genius when you get it done in two."" If nobody else can do what you do, then nobody knows how long it should take.


Tell your boss it took you all day to drive around selling ads, or that you're running into all sorts of problems filling out that report, so you haven't gotten it finished, and it'll probably take a few more hours. If you're already done, just sit there doing nothing and making your money.

, An old adage from automotive factory lines, passed down from older hands to new workers was to just sit tight if something went wrong. If your machine stops working and the line stops, don't go running off to tell someone. Just stand there. You're getting paid either way.


You don't have to work in a factory to abide by this basic rule. If you're ever working and something goes wrong, or breaks, just kick back. Put on your confused ""trying-to-figure-it-out"" face and scrutinize things closely, doing absolutely nothing.

, Some people let their egos get in the way of their doing nothing. You're not in a productivity competition with your coworkers. You don't need to be hyperactive if you're being paid hourly and you're on the clock. If something comes up that anyone can do, let someone else do it.


You can even help this process along. Learn to say, ""I could do it, I guess, but that's totally in Jim's wheelhouse. He'll knock that out of the park.""
Of course, at some workplaces, your paycheck does depend on your productivity. You usually can't let someone else do everything for you.

, Take as long a break in the middle of the day as possible while you're working, especially if you're on the clock for it. When five o'clock rolls around, that extra fifteen minutes you got to steal to finish your sandwich will be the last thing on everyone's mind.


At most jobs, you'll have to feel this out to see how far you can push it. If you're on the clock from 8-3, you can always say that you've got to be somewhere else and you can't stay when it's time to leave.
Just ignore anyone who makes comments or tries to make you feel ""lazy"" for taking a decent break. Unless it affects your employment, it's not your job to care.

, Depending on what kind of worker you are and what kind of job you have, you can always find a way to emphasize your good characteristics as a worker to allow for a lot more laziness.


If you're a talkative, active presence, make that presence known at meetings and in group situations by talking a lot. Be the ""idea"" person in the room. You'll seem like you're busy and valuable, even if when you're alone, you do basically nothing.
If you're a quiet, but studious worker, get away with doing nothing by putting it off until later. Do nothing Monday through Wednesday, but slam yourself on Thursday and Friday to get all your work done for the week.

, You don't have to be the best worker at your job, you just have to be good enough to keep getting paid. That's all that you have to worry about. If your boss saddles you with a big responsibility, it's ok to fail. In the future, you won't be asked to take on special responsibilities again. Good deal.


It's important to look as if you came close, but couldn't get it done. Take a project in the completely wrong direction, but take some time to do it. It's better to make good-natured mistakes.

, If you could do nothing and get paid for it, that'd be a pretty sweet deal. Jobs in which it's very easy to steal time include:


Night security
Ticket-taking
House-sitting
Writer of spa reviews
Cute pet video aggregator
Food testing
Any telecommuting job

Keep your inbox full.,
Be positive.,
Eliminate your attachments.,
Accept the charity of others.,
Commit to happiness, not responsibility.,
Sleep in.",How to Do Nothing3," If people try to get a hold of you on the phone and get the full inbox treatment, they'll think you're so busy you're totally swamped with things to do. Here's the secret: just don't listen to any of them.

, If you're good-natured, hapless, and lazy, people will think it's just part of your personality. If you're a jerk and try to get away with doing nothing all the time, people will think you're a super-jerk.


If somebody catches you doing nothing, or gets on your case about it, just admit that you're confused: ""I wasn't sure about that. You're right, you're right. Thanks for getting me on track!""

, The less personal responsibility required of you, the less you'll have to do. It's hard to get away with doing nothing if you got to pick up kids from soccer practice, walk a dog, or go on lots of dates. If you want to do nothing in the long-term, keep your life and simple and streamlined as possible.


Be a minimalist. Keep your relationships few and far between and your belongings cut to the absolute bare essentials.

, When you let other people do things for you, that's less you have to do for yourself. If you let your studious and friendly neighbor know that you don't have a lawnmower because you can't afford one, watch how fast your grass gets mowed. Even if the real problem is laziness, coax out charity from others to get away with doing less.

, Anytime you ""have to"" do something, it's less satisfactory than doing something you want to do. While some people think fulfilling your responsibilities is a rewarding and wholesome way of living life, it's also meh. If you want to do nothing, stay focused on having fun and idling, not ladder-climbing social responsibilities.


Often, we define doing something and nothing in terms of whether or not we deem it ""useful."" Your happiness? Yeah, that's useful. That means taking some time, every now and then, to do nothing., Great way to do nothing? Sleep. It'll cut into your opportunity to be productive throughout the day, and it'll be the most comfortable and restorative way of doing nothing in the long term.

Don’t try to relax.",How to Relax in Bed," Whether it’s morning or night, you want your relaxing in bedtime to just be you and your bed (and maybe a cup of tea or a book). Anything else should be turned off and put away. Turn your alarm clock away from you, turn off your phone, shut your computer, and lock the door.


Having electronics on cues our bodies to stay on the alert. Apart from the light that they emit (that messes with our sleep-awake cycle), they keep us thinking about the million things we have to do. Get rid of them and your brain may be able to shut off, too.To help with this, try staying away from all electronics and artificial light sources that would keep your brain awake for at least one hour before you go to bed.
Alright, so the one caveat here is TV if done correctly. We’ll talk about how to do this the right way in the next section.;
, If it’s Sunday morning and you’re looking for a luxurious lie-in, throw open the curtains and get your room filled with natural light. Soak up that vitamin D from the sun and let the light warm the room.


If it’s at night, match the lighting to your needs. If you’re reading a book, turn on a lamp by your bed. Apart from that, have the lighting be dim. If you don’t intend to sleep, you can have the lighting be a bit brighter, but it shouldn’t be anything that offends your retinas.

, If you eventually want to fall asleep, it’s a good idea to lower the temperature to around 66°F (19°C). Not only does this program your body to go into sleep mode, but recent science says it can also up your metabolism and even regulate your insulin levels (helping fight against diabetes). If that’s not reason enough, what is?


If you don’t want to fall asleep, make the temperature a little higher, but not too high. You want that sweet spot where your body wants to climb under the covers but not fall asleep. It’ll likely be somewhere around 69° (20°C).

, There is some pretty decent research on the effects of aromatherapy, and it all points to increased relaxation. If you don’t take essential oils yourself, you can put them in a diffuser and fill the room with a scent that tells your body it’s time to relax.Why not let your nose do the work?


Some good scents are lavender, petitgrain, chamomile, geranium, sandalwood and rose. However, any scent you enjoy could put you in zen garden mode.

, Even if the temperature is perfect, your bed is comfy, the lighting is dim, and the room smells great, you’re not going to have a relaxing time wearing your Sunday best. Get out of presentation mode and into your pajamas. Or heck, into your birthday suit.


You should adjust the temperature to match the clothes you’re wearing. If you’re wearing long johns and a sweater to bed, the room can be a bit colder. If you’re going like the day you were born, you may want to make it a little warmer.

, For many people, writing in a journal is something we've all done, vowing to keep at it and quitting within the week. But what most of us don't know is that journaling can actually reduce anxiety and stress – in fact, journaling about our worries helps get rid of them and helps us perform better in daily life.If you didn't have a reason to journal before, why not do it for your mental health?


If you have a notebook and pen in hand but don't know quite what to write about, look out the window for inspiration. What do you hear? What kind of trees are those? Those birds, what are they? What are you noticing that you didn't notice before?

, You probably know that doing brain games and reading books are good for you intellectually, but did you also know that they're good for eliminating stress and taking your mind off of your worries?Having something else to concentrate on may be all you need.


It's not just crossword puzzles, of course. You could also take a load off with sudoku, word finds, or other math and word puzzles, too.

, We all need to remind ourselves sometimes that we are cared for and safe – even by our own selves. Take a morning, afternoon, or evening and just do whatever makes you feel good. You could sit in bed with an avocado face mask on while you paint your nails, put a hot oil mixture on your hair, or just lie down with a heated massage pad and soak the moment in.Sometimes there's too much on our minds to spend time primping. If that rings true for you, instead, take this time to organize your mind, writing down to-do lists, planning out your budget or meals for the week, and just getting a firm hold on the steering wheel of your life. When you have this feeling, the rest could fall into place.

, All right, so in general, electronics are bad. But that being said, some people do find TV in bed to be a good way to wind down from the stress of everyday life. If this sounds familiar, don’t try to unwind with your favorite crime drama or even the news (since most of it is so negative). Stick to something light and cheerful to keep your brain light and cheerful.Your favorite old-school sitcom is a good bet. Find a program where you can turn your brain off and enjoy the laughs. Avoid the ones that make you worry or evoke a negative emotional reaction, like fear or anger.

, In addition to the feeling of having something warm in your hands being quite comforting, tea itself can help you relax and destress. Passionflower and chamomile are especially good if you’re looking to go to sleep, and green tea is good for destressing and getting rid of anger. Add honey to your tea for an extra stress-fighting boost. It supposedly reduces inflammation in the brain, lowering depression and anxiety., But be careful not to get crumbs in the sheets! If you’re looking for a snack, here’s a few things to put on your relax-in-bed menu:Dark chocolate. Just a little bit (about an ounce and a half) has been shown to reduce cortisol levels, which is the hormone in your body that produces stress. It may also be able to help regulate your metabolism.Mango. This fruit has high amounts of linalool, which has also been shown to be a serious stress-buster.Chewing gum. And it doesn’t matter the flavor, either. Just a few minutes of chewing can help lower stress levels, or so recent science has shown.Anything crunchy. Stressed individuals tend to crave crunchy things, and it seems that crunching away can be a stress-reducer. So grab a handful of nuts or celery and start working on your peace of mind., We all know that feeling of holding an adorable kitten, puppy, or even baby. It warms our hearts and puts our mind in a good place. Now imagine that feeling in bed! That feeling of unconditional love will seep into your veins and you’ll never want to get out of bed.


It turns out that owning a pet has health benefits too. Owners of furry, four-legged friends tend to have lower blood pressure levels and are at lower risk for depression., Sometimes all we need to relax is just to get out of the past or the present and delve ourselves into the potential of the future. Grab a notebook and start working on something you can look forward to, like a vacation. Picture the locale in your mind. What do you want to do? Where do you want to go?


This is should be thought of as a sort of practical visualization. You’re not only thinking of how wonderful your destination is, but also how happy you’ll be. It may also serve as motivation to save up money, get in shape, and feel good about where your life is going.

, A good way to focus on your body and bring your mind into the present is to monitor your breathing. It's the first step of meditation, after all. Get comfortable and focus on a deep inhale in and a deep exhale out. How do your lungs feel? Your diaphragm? Your nostrils and throat? Focusing on this can take you to an entirely different place mentally – a stress-free place of calm.


Try starting out with breathing in for four beats and breathing out for eight. Do this for a few times, and gradually move up to inhaling for eight and breathing out for sixteen. As you breathe slower, your heart rate will also slow down, cuing your body to relax.

, When it comes to progressive relaxation, you have two basic options, and they’re both quite effective. Here are the details:Progressive muscle relaxation. As you're laying down focusing on your breathing, start moving your focus to your toes. Relax them completely. Move up to your ankles. Let those go, too. Slowly but surely move up your body until every bit of you is consciously relaxed.
Progressive tension release. For this type of relaxation, take a deep breath in. When you let it out, relax your body just a little. Then when you inhale in, let your body be. Don't try to do anything. But on the exhale, relax a little more. Continue this until your body feels completely relaxed.

, If you're the religious type, a little bit of prayer in bed may be all you need to feel a little more at peace. As you're doing so, remember to take a second to listen – it doesn't have to be just you talking, talking, talking.


If that doesn't appeal to you, try meditation. Why? Tons of research has denoted that meditation helps alleviate levels of stress, anxiety, and depression.And you don't have to sit-up and say, ""ommm,"" either. Just focus on your breath, and let everything you notice sweep over you without reacting. It's not about clearing your mind, it's about letting absolutely nothing fester.

, Sometimes the only thing you feel capable of is closing your eyes, and that's totally a-okay in the name of relaxation. As you do so, picture your version of paradise. Be sure to make it as sensory as possible, using all 5 of your senses. The more complete of a picture you paint, the more effective your visualization will be.


Let's say you're on a deserted beach. Are you standing or sitting? How does the sand feel? Is there a breeze? Are there droplets of water in the breeze, too? What do the waves sound like? Are there birds? Can you smell the fish? How bright is it?

, Did you know that a hand massage can actually slow a pounding heart? It’s true.Whether it’s you giving it to yourself or someone else being graciously giving, it can help calm you down and center you for ultimate relaxation.


Acupressure can also be quite effective. It's similar to a massage, but there's less movement. Try squeezing the pad of skin between your pointer finger and thumb and hold it there for five seconds before releasing. Your body has several pressure points, and tuning into them can help your muscles release tension., You know those people that try to be cool and fail miserably? And how it’s because they’re trying to be cool and that’s just not how it works? Well, it’s not how relaxing works either. Don’t try to relax. If you do, you’ll just be focused on how you’re not relaxed and get frustrated. Instead, just slow down. Pick whatever relaxing activity you have in mind and the relaxing will come. Trust it.


This list is by no means exhaustive. If it inspires you to do something else equally as relaxing, then do it. It's about what makes you feel good and grants you zen, not what anybody else says. If you want crumbs in the bed, then let crumbs be in the bed. Why not?

Increase your lung capacity.,
Create a peaceful environment.,
Wait an hour or two after eating.,
Avoid injury.",How to Do Breathing Exercises3," Although you can't increase the size of your lungs with aerobic activity or breathing exercises, you can improve their efficiency.

Brainstorm ideas.,
Think of a time when you felt safe or happy.,
Create different rooms.,
Fill it with your favorite people.,
Engage all of your senses.,
Write down every detail.",How to Create a Safe Place in Your Mind1," The goal of a safe place is to feel safe, happy, calm, and secure. To create your own mental safe place, you should try to come up with a place that makes you happy or secure. Look through old photographs, books, magazines, and pieces of art. Choose ones that give you positive emotions, and set these aside.


Do you feel more at peace in natural settings, such as the beach or in a garden, or do you feel more secure inside a building, such as a castle or a house?
Are there any quotes, poems, or stories that make you feel at peace?
Do you prefer energetic and populated places or tranquil and isolated places?;
, Your memories are one of the best places to find what makes you happy. Try to think of times when you were calm, happy, or peaceful. Pin down where these memories took place. It could be your grandma’s kitchen, the place where you married your spouse, a playground, or a favorite park.Ask yourself:


Where did this take place?
Who was with me?
How old was I?
Why does this make me happy?

, Your safe place can have several different sections, rooms, or compartments to allow yourself various places to go. These rooms can be organized by emotion, theme, or problem. These will allow you space to move through your safe space, and it can help you compartmentalize and deal with individual problems.For example, you may want to have a garden where you go if you are stressed from work. If you’re feeling nervous or anxious, you can travel from your garden into a tranquility room, where you can find peace. This might be an uncluttered room in light colors, such as lavender or soft blue.
If your safe place is outside, you can still have different areas. For example, if your safe place is in a jungle, you can have one area that is by a great river, another that is up high in a tree, and another that is in a patch of flowers.

, While some people may prefer to have a quiet, isolated safe place, others might find it comforting to see friends and family members in their safe place. Think about people who make you happy, and imagine them greeting you in your safe place.


If there are any deceased friends or family members who you would like to see again, you can imagine that they are in your safe place. You can have conversations with them or ask them for advice.

, Your safe place should not just be a scene that you see. Use all of your senses to imagine this mental sanctuary. Smell, sounds, touch, and taste can help you immerse yourself.What do you see? You might imagine trees, mountains, streams, or caves. There might be a garden or a library. If you have a favorite quote or mantra, you might imagine that it is posted to the wall of a room.
What does it smell like? If you think of the ocean, smell the salt air. If you’re on a mountain, you might smell pine trees. If you’re in an old childhood home, you might smell baked goods.
What does it sound like? You might hear the wind blowing through the trees or the gentle roar of the ocean. There might be birds chirping or wind chimes jingling.
Imagine yourself touching your surroundings. What do you feel? Is it smooth, rough, gritty, or polished? Is it hot or cold? Hard or soft?
Can you taste anything? If you imagine yourself sitting in a Parisian cafe, you might taste the bread. If you are on the ocean, you might taste the salty air.

, Once you have created your safe place, write down every single detail that you can recall. Describe it in great detail so that you can return to it easily whenever you need to go. If you prefer, you can draw, paint, sculpt, or video tape your description.


What is the setting?
What surrounds you?
What colors do you see?
How big or small is it?
What sensations do you feel?
Are there animals or other people there?

Return to breathing naturally.After completing your final inhale/exhale sequence, sit quietly and return to normal breathing for about five minutes.,
Try a simple walking meditation.,
Practice gratitude.In addition to -- or instead of -- the walking meditation, try another quick meditation by practicing gratitude.",How to Do Alternate Nostril Breathing2," When you’re ready, open your eyes, relax your arms, and rise.

, Alternate nostril breathing is often performed before meditation.Walking meditation involves finding a quiet outdoor space in a park or backyard, and walking through it at a slow or medium pace. Stay aware of the many sensations in your feet: your feet touching the ground, the movement of your legs, and the fit of your socks and shoes.


If you have trouble engaging in meditation at first, be patient with yourself and keep at it. The more you practice meditation, the better your technique will be, and you’ll be able to find more ways to focus on staying mindful and calm.

, Close your eyes and picture someone that you’re grateful for. Think of one aspect of their face that you really like -- their eyes, nose, or mouth, for instance. Send them a mental thank-you note by simply thinking, “I am thankful you’re in my life.” Repeat for five or six friends and family members.

Incorporate a mudra into you breathing.A mudra is a symbolic hand gesture used in yoga, as well as Hindu and Buddhist ceremonies, that many practitioners of yoga believe can channel energy in particular ways.,
Breathe in for a given length of time.,
Inhale through the opposite nostril that you exhale from.In this variation, breathe in through your right nostril after first covering your left nostril with your thumb.,
Alternate your breathing patterns.",How to Do Alternate Nostril Breathing3," It is not uncommon for someone performing alternate nostril breathing to employ the Mrigi mudra in their exercise.


Bring your index and middle finger down to touch your palm. Keep your other fingers straight and stiff.
Instead of closing your nostrils with your thumbs, use the pinkie and ring fingers of the opposite hand.
For instance, you could close your left nostril by forming a Mrigi mudra with your right hand, then bringing the ring and pinkie fingers of that hand to your left nostril and gently push it closed.

, Instead of counting the individual inhalations and exhalations during your alternate nostril breathing session, you could simply set a watch or clock for a certain time during the breathing. For instance, you might set a watch for three minutes, then close your right nostril and breathe in long and deep, hold your breath, then breathe out. After three minutes, reset the alarm and do the same on the left nostril.This will relieve you of the need to count each inhale/exhale cycle.

, When you’re ready to exhale, bring your left index finger across your nose and squeeze it gently against your right nostril. In the same motion, remove your left thumb from against your left nostril. Exhale through your left nostril. Repeat for as many cycles as you wish.


Alternately, you could start by covering your right nostril first. It makes no difference.
If you wish, you could bring your opposite thumb up to close each nostril, instead of moving your index finger across your nose to close your opposite nostril.

, When you’re starting out, the length of your inhalation, pause, and exhalation should be equal in length. For instance, you might breathe in slowly for five seconds, hold the breath for five seconds, then breathe out for five seconds before switching nostrils. You could, however, try to adjust these ratios to suit your own style and needs.If you wish to relax more deeply, increase the amount of time you spend exhaling. For instance, if you breathe in for five seconds, breathe out for about seven seconds.
If you find that you feel tired after practicing alternate nostril breathing, try adjusting your rate of inhalation so that it lasts longer than your exhalation. For instance, if you breathe in for five seconds, breathe out over a period of about three seconds. This will boost alertness and help you perk up.

Try pursed lip breathing.,
Focus on keeping a steady breathing pattern.,
Take a deep breath and then brace your core while engaged in high intensity sports.,
Exhale while lifting a weight and then inhale at top of the lift.",How to Develop Good Breathing Habits2," This will keep your airways open longer and reduce the number of breaths you have to take. Breathe in through your nose, and then exhale through your mouth with pursed lips for at least twice as long as it took you to inhale. Doing this while exercising will also help you to control your breathing more effectively., It’s easy to find yourself out of breath while running or taking a walk. Focus on keeping an even breathing pattern and exhaling completely.If you find yourself out of breath, slow down and begin breathing slower. Counting can also be a helpful tool. Try counting to two while inhaling and then counting to four while exhaling.
If you’re running, try taking one breath for every two times your foot strikes the ground. Then take another two steps while breathing out.

, This can be helpful when you are anticipating an impact, like being tackled in a game of football. It will aid in stabilizing the core and protecting the spine., Be sure you keep your core engaged. Don't hold your breath as this can negatively affect blood flow and heart rate."

Do this 4 times.

, Meditation helps calm the mind and regulate our breathing. Sit in a quiet room with your eyes partially closed. Breathe slowly in and out through your nose. Be mindful of your breath but don't attempt to control it.

While some people prefer to meditate in a cross-legged lotus position, you can sit any way you like so long as you are not in pain.If you work in an office, you might want to close your door while you meditate. If you do not have a door, slip away to a bathroom, empty conference room, or to your car.
If you lie down while you meditate, you may fall asleep.

, Breathing is an important part of the process. It helps you relax and control your body as you go to your safe place. Start with a deep breath, and slowly exhale.

Walk along this trail until you arrive at your safe place., Try not to bring any negativity, anger, resentment, insecurities, or guilt into your safe space with you. Let go of them at the door. If you're having difficulty doing this, try using a mantra. Repeat the mantra until you no longer feel stressed, tense, angry, or upset.A simple mantra you can use is ""Let go"" or ""I'm calm.""

, When you arrive at your safe place, walk through it until you find the room, area, or destination you’re looking for. Allow the safe place to come alive around you. Instead of a static image, let the leaves blow in the wind, birds fly in the air, or clouds float overhead. Take a hike through the mountain or rock in a hammock. These actions not only make the safe place seem more real in your head, but they provide calming relief to you as well.


You are not limited to realistic actions either. If you want to fly through the air or swim through the depths of the oceans, you can do it, provided that it is a sensation that makes you feel peaceful and free. , If something is worrying you, you can deal with it in your safe place. Identify the problem and why it is worrying you. Allow it to take on a physical form or shape. It could be a rock, a marble, or a box. Now picture that object being destroyed or taken far away from you.For example, you might imagine your problems as appearing on a long piece of paper. Crumple up that paper and throw it in the trash. You can bury the paper, or you can tear it into many different pieces.

Read your description.,
Play music.,
Choose a good time of day.,
Give yourself enough time.",How to Create a Safe Place in Your Mind3," To help you return to your safe place, you can start by looking back over your description of it. You can also look at any drawings, images, or tapes that you made about your safe place. Use these to help you re-visualize your safe place.


It may be helpful to write down anything new you discover about your safe place as you develop it. Set aside five minutes after each meditation to write down or draw anything new you found or created during this session.

, Find a relaxing song or recording that helps you visualize your safe place. This could be classical music, recordings of nature, chanting, or wind chimes. If you play this music every time you visualize your safe place, you will find that it helps you return there more quickly and effectively.

, There are certain times of day that are better for meditation than others. If you are going to make visualizing your safe place a regular habit, choose a time when you are neither distracted nor sleepy. If you find yourself falling asleep during your visualization, you may need to pick a different time.The morning, early evening, and lunch time may be ideal for meditating. If you try meditating before you go to bed, however, you may fall asleep., At the beginning, you may only be able to visit your safe place for three to five minutes at a time. This is normal. With practice, this period can become longer. You may be able to sustain your meditation for fifteen or thirty minutes.When you visit your safe place, make sure that you have at least twenty minutes when you will be uninterrupted.


You should turn off all distractions, such as your phone. If you are expecting a phone call, you may want to save your visualization for later.

Antioxidants have been shown to enhance lung capacity and improve the quality of breathing in patients.Blueberries, broccoli, spinach, grapes, sweet potatoes, green tea, and fish in particularly are high in anti-oxidants.;
, Regular exercise will help keep your lungs working to their strongest capacity. You should aim for either;


At least 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity (like walking, swimming or golf), four to five times a week. OR
At least 25 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity (like jogging/running, biking or playing basketball) at least three days per week., Smoking tobacco is one of the leading causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Smoking can also cause emphysema and lung cancer. The toxins from cigarettes can cause damaging inflammation in the bronchus, making it difficult to breathe.To protect your lungs, do not use smokeless tobacco products such as chewing tobacco or snuff. These increase your risk of mouth cancer, as well as gum disease, tooth decay, and pancreatic cancer.E-cigarettes may also be dangerous to your lung health New studies have found that some companies use a flavouring in e-cigarettes which comes from a toxic chemical called Diacetyl. This chemical has been linked to constrictive bronchiolitis, a rare and life-threatening form of non-reversible obstructive lung disease in which the bronchioles are compressed and narrowed by scar tissue and/or inflammation.To detox your lungs, don't use any kind of smoking or tobacco product.

, Make sure that the environments you are in most frequently -- such as your workplace and home -- are well ventilated. When working with with hazardous materials, such as paint fumes, dust at construction sites, or chemicals from hair dyes and treatments, be sure that you have proper ventilation or proper respiratory protection equipment such as a dust mask or personal respirator.


Make sure that you have open vents and windows to keep fresh air circulating.
Consider wearing a respirator when working in a small space.
If you are cleaning with strong chemicals such as bleach, be sure that you have open windows in the room, and that you have the opportunity to leave the space and give your lungs a break.


Do not mix bleach with ammonia. Together they generate a toxic chloramine vapor which damages the mucous membranes of the lungs.


Avoid using fireplaces and wood-burning stoves indoors as these can also put harmful toxins in your lungs.

, Some plants emit spores, pollen, and other potential irritants into the air. Make sure that household plants are not aggravating your lungs.

, Choosing a HEPA filter that can remove small particles of debris and allergens from the air can help your lungs stay healthy.Ozone air purifiers are not as effective at reducing allergens and other particles in the environment, and may even irritate the lungs., One of the best ways to naturally strengthen your lungs is to breathe properly. Inhale from your diaphragm, expanding and pushing out the muscles in your lower belly. As you exhale, your muscles should retract back inward.Breathing from your diaphragm, as opposed to breathing from your throat, will help expand the capacity of your lungs and make them stronger.

, Inhale and then exhale. As you do both, count the seconds it takes to breathe. Try to gradually extend the time it takes to breathe by one or two counts.


Be sure not to strain yourself or hold your breath for too long. This could cause you to deprive oxygen to the brain, which could cause dizziness, or fainting

, Sitting and standing up straight can help you breathe so your lungs gain strength.


An exercise to help expand the capacity of your lung, is to sit on a chair with your back straight, and lift your arms above your head while breathing deeply., Oregano's primary benefits are due to its carvacrol and rosmarinic acid content. Both compounds are natural decongestants and histamine reducers that have shown to be of benefit to the respiratory tract and nasal passage airflow.The volatile oils in oregano, thymol and carvacol, have been shown to inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria like staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Oregano can be consume in fresh or dried forms, and two to three drops of oregano oil can be added to milk or juice daily.

, Eucalyptus is a common ingredient in cough lozenges and syrups. It owes its effectiveness to an expectorant compound called cineole, which can ease a cough, fight congestion, and soothe irritated sinus passages.


To use as a steam inhalation, add a few drops of eucalyptus oil to hot water and inhale steam for up to 15 minutes.Be aware: Eucalyptus oil may decrease how quickly the liver breaks down some medications. Taking eucalyptus oil along with some medications can increase their effects and side effects. Before using eucalyptus oil, talk to your healthcare provider to determine if you take any medications that may be effected,

Medications such as Voltaren, Ibuprofen, Motrin, Celebrex, Warfarin, Allegra, and others.



, A sauna or hot water shower increases the secretion of sweat, and helps the lungs rid themselves of toxic substances.


Be sure to drink water after you take a long shower or spend time in a sauna because you do not want to risk becoming dehydrated.
Ensure any hot tubs are properly cleaned to avoid any infections. High heat encourages bacterial growth, and although the water or surroundings may smell strongly of chlorine, it is hard to maintain bactericidal levels of dissolved chlorine gas in hot water. On testing, the bath may be found to contain high levels of chlorine, but most of it may be in a form that has little effect on contaminating organisms.

, Peppermint and peppermint oil contain menthol, a soothing ingredient known to relax the smooth muscles of the respiratory tract and promote free breathing.


Paired with the antihistamine effect of peppermint, menthol is a fantastic decongestant. Consider chewing two to three peppermint leaves (as opposed to candied versions) in order to get the most immediate benefits. Many find relief using therapeutic chest balms and other inhalants that contain menthol to help break up congestion.

, The mullein plant has been known to clear mucus and cleanse the bronchial tubes. Both the flowers and the leaves of the mullein plant are used to make an herbal extract that may help to strengthen the lungs.


Mullein is used by herbal practitioners to clear excess mucus from the lungs, cleanse the bronchial tubes, and reduce inflammation present in the respiratory tract.
You can make a tea can from one teaspoon of the dried herb and one cup of boiled water., If you are congested, you might find licorice root tea to be particularly soothing. Licorice is thought to decrease swelling, thin mucus secretions, and decrease coughing. Licorice may help to thin the phlegm in the respiratory tract, aiding in the expulsion of mucus.
It is also thought to have antibacterial and antiviral effects which may help fight off viral and bacterial infections.

, It is currently being studied for its possible role in the prevention of some cancers, including lung cancer, as it has been shown to inhibit the growth of certain non-small cancer cells.Consuming ginger root tea mixed with lemon can facilitate less laborious breathing.
Raw or cooked ginger can also improve digestion.

, If you have a cough or cough that persists for more than a month, or that causes difficulty breathing and shortness of breath, you should consult your physician promptly., Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease describes both chronic bronchitis and emphysema, most people with COPD have a combination of both conditions. This disease is generally progressive, meaning it develops over a period of time. COPD is the fourth highest cause of death in the United States.COPD affects the lungs, specifically the alveoli, which are small air sacs that facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

Emphysema is a condition where the bronchi and bronchioles are inflamed and continually swollen and clogged. This causes the alveoli to swell. These fragile air sacs burst and merge together. This damage to the alveoli makes it more difficult for the transfer of oxygen and carbon dioxide to take place.
Chronic bronchitis causes the lungs produce more mucus, which then clogs airways and coats the alveoli, making it difficult to breath., Although anyone can develop COPD, there are a few demographics that are more likely to suffer from it. COPD tends to affect adults, especially those over 40, more regularly than children.


Men and women develop it in equal numbers, but cigarette smokers have an especially high risk for developing COPD."

Count the breaths.,
Determine whether the breathing rate is within the normal range.,
Look for signs of respiratory distress.,
Check breaths per minute as needed.,
Call emergency services.,
Get breathing assistance.,
Avoid hyperventilation due to anxiety.",How to Check Someone's Breathing Rate (Rate of Respiration)," Breathing is measured in breaths per minute or bpm. To get an accurate measurement, the person must be at rest. This means she is not breathing faster than usual due to exercising. She should be still for at least 10 minutes before you count her breaths.Have the person sit up straight. If you are measuring an infant, lay the baby flat on her back on a firm surface.
Use a stop watch to time one minute. Count the number of times the person’s chest rises and falls during that minute.
If you tell the person that you are going to measure her breathing, she is likely to change her breathing rate without realizing it. Tell her to breathe normally. To improve the accuracy of your result, you can take the measurement three times and average the answers.
If you are pressed for time, count the breaths in a 15 second window, then multiply the number of breaths by 4. This gives a close approximation of breaths per minute and is useful in emergency situations.;
, Children breathe faster than adults so you need to compare your number to the normal number of breaths per minute for the person’s age group. The rates are as follows30 to 60 bpm for an infant who is 0 to 6 months old
24 to 30 bpm for an infant who is 6 to 12 months old
20 to 30 bpm for a child who is 1 to 5 years old
12 to 20 for a child who is 6 to 11 years old
12 to 18 for someone who is 12 or older

, If someone’s breathing rate is higher or lower than the expected range, and she has not been exercising, this could be an indication that something is wrong. Other signs of respiratory distress include:Flaring the nostrils during each breath.
The skin has a dusky color.
The ribs and center of the chest are pulled in.
The person makes a wheezing, grunting, or crying sound when breathing.
The person's lips and/or eyelids are blue.
The person is breathing with their entire shoulders/chest area. This is considered labored breathing.

, If you are with an individual and the breathing rate needs to be taken frequently, then try re-taking it every 15 minutes for non emergency cases. If the person is in an emergency situation, then check their breaths per minute every 5 minutes.

Checking the person's breaths per minute can give you early warning signs of deteriorating conditions, shock, or other changes.
If possible, try to keep a record of the person's breaths per minute in case you go to the hospital.

, If you or someone you are with is having trouble breathing, then call emergency services right away. Breathing too fast or too slow can be signs of a medical problem including:Asthma
Anxiety
Pneumonia
Heart failure
A drug overdose
Fever

, If someone needs help breathing, there are several ways that a doctor can administer oxygen. This includes:An oxygen mask. This is a mask that fits over the person’s face and delivers a higher concentration of oxygen than is present in the atmosphere. In the environment, the air is 21% oxygen. But if someone is having trouble breathing, they may need a higher concentration.
CPAP or continuous positive airway pressure. Tubes are put into the person’s nose and oxygen flows in under a small amount of air pressure. The pressure helps the airways and the lungs stay open.
Ventilation. This involves putting a breathing tube down through the person’s mouth and into the windpipe. Oxygen can then be administered directly into the lungs.

, Some people breathe very quickly, called hyperventilation, when they are anxious or panicking. This can lead to the feeling of not being able to catch your breath even though you are getting too much oxygen while breathing too fast. If someone you are with experiences this you can:Reassure the person and help her relax. Tell her that she is not having a heart attack and is not going to die. Assure her that she is doing ok.
Have the person adopt breathing techniques that will reduce the amount of oxygen she gets. She can: breathe into a paper bag, purse her lips, or cover one nostril and her mouth while breathing. As the balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen in her system returns to normal, she should feel better.
You can also help the person to relax by advising them to concentrate on a single object on the horizon, such as a tree or building. Or, you can also tell them to close their eyes to ease the sense of panic the person might feel.
Encourage the person to see a doctor.

Write pressing thoughts down.,
Use a journal.,
Focus on one task at a time.,
Learn to sort information.",How to Calm an Overactive Mind1," If you find your mind racing before a bed or while you're trying to work on something else, take a moment to organize your thoughts. Write down the things you need to get down on a to-do list. Put any ideas down in a notebook or computer file for that purpose. Jot any questions or thoughts down on a notepad. Once you've taken a few minutes to organize your thoughts on paper or a screen, your mind will be freer to work on other tasks., Another helpful writing technique is to make writing in a journal a part of your nightly routine. Taking time to write about your thoughts and feelings can have a similar effect to telling someone about them; that is, it helps draw out some of the tension and anxiety. Don't think you have to write about anything specific--just start writing, and see what comes out., It's tempting in today's busy world to try to do more than one thing at a time. However, your brain isn't built to work like that; rather, it's built to focus on one task at a time. If you try to focus on more than one task, your work becomes sloppier and you'll feel mentally disheveled., When you have too much information coming in, it can feel overwhelming. Try to develop a system to sort through information as it comes in, only keeping the important stuff. The extraneous details just bog down your mind. One way to know what's important is to listen to what's being repeated, as usually only the important stuff gets that treatment."

Start by applying acupressure to the acupressure points on the ear.,
Apply pressure to additional acupressure points that promote weight loss.,
Try a different point, or points, if one makes you uncomfortable or does not give you the results you want.",How to Use Acupressure for Weight Loss1," Place your thumb directly in front of the triangular shaped flap of tissue found at the front of each ear. The thumb is used because it covers the most area and will affect all three points.


Another way to find this point is to place your finger against your jaw and open and shut your mouth. Find the point that has most of the movement in your jaw.
Apply medium and constant pressure for three minutes to control appetite and hunger and improve digestion.
If you only want to use one point, use the ear points. It is the only part of the body where three or more acupressure points that control hunger and appetite can be found together.Acupressure points SI19, TW21, and GB2 are located around the ear. These have been studied most for weight loss.;
, There are a wide variety of other points that can help you reach your weight loss goals.


GV26 is located between the upper lip and the nose, in the crease or depression (the philtrum). Apply medium pressure for five minutes twice a day. This point can curb appetite and control hunger.
Ren 6 is found 3 cm directly below the belly button. Use your index and middle fingers to massage this point up and down two minutes twice a day. This point can improve digestion.
Knee Point ST36 is found 2 inches below the knee cap and slightly off center, towards the outer part of the leg. Apply pressure on this point for one minute with your forefinger. You can know you are in the right spot by flexing your foot — you should be able to feel the muscle move under your finger. Press this point for two minutes every day. This point supports healthy stomach function.
Elbow point LI 11 is found on the inner side of the elbow crease, near the outer part of the elbow. This point stimulates the function of the intestine by removing excess heat and unwanted moisture from the body. Use your thumb and apply pressure to this point for one minute every day.
Pressure point SP6 is found 2 inches above the ankle, on the inner side of the leg and behind the bone. Apply pressure for one minute every day with your thumb. Release slowly. This point helps balance fluids.
The abdominal sorrow points are located beneath your lowest ribs in a straight line down from your earlobes.Press into this point under each rib for five minutes a day. This point can also help relieve indigestion.

, Stay aware of how you are feeling and responding to the pressure. Each person may respond uniquely, depending on their situation. Don’t overdo it!


You can use these acupressure points until you have reached your ideal weight and then use them to help maintain that weight.
There are no known negative effects of this type of acupressure.

Try using a mantra.,
Focus on your breathing.,
Meditate anywhere.,
Use walking meditation.",How to Calm an Overactive Mind2," A mantra is just a simple phrase or word that you repeat over and over. You use it to clear your mind in meditation. For instance, one of the traditional phrases is ""om,"" usually drawn out (""ommmmm""). However, you can use any phrase you want from ""I love life"" to ""No more fear.""To try it out, take a moment to close your eyes, and breathe deeply. Repeat your phrase over and over, focusing your thoughts only on your mantra. If your mind wanders, focus back on your mantra.

, One way to meditate is to simply focus on your breathing. Sit quietly with your eyes closed. Pay attention only to your breathing as you try to slow it down. If it helps, try counting to eight as you breathe in and to eight as you breathe out. Your mind will wander off, but just bring it back to your breathing., Another way to meditate, which you can do almost anywhere, is to focus your attention on what your body is feeling. Sit or stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Focus your attention on what your muscles are feeling.For instance, on a subway, you might feel the movement under your feet. Sitting a park, you might just feel the weight of your body on the bench, the breeze on your face, the solidness of the ground under your feet.By focusing on what your body is feeling, you're pulling yourself out of your mind and calming down., Walking meditation is similar to breathing meditation; that is you focus on your breathing to pull yourself out of your head. However, you also focus on the steps you are taking as well.Slow down your pace. When you're using walking meditation, you need to be aware of each step, and you can only do that if you slow down your walking.The great thing about walking meditation is that you can do it almost anytime, even going around the grocery store."

Express your thoughts in writing.,
Express your thoughts in drawing.,
Have a discussion with another person.Maybe you're the kind of person who keeps their thoughts and emotions bubbled up inside.,
Hang out with a pet.,
Remind yourself of the truly important things in life.",How to Clear Your Mind1," If your mind is a tangled mess of thoughts, it can help to write them down. Start off writing in free-form: record how you're feeling, why you're feeling, and what you want to do about it. After recording this information, you'll have something concrete to reflect upon; this will help you feel a sense of accomplishment, even if you haven't ""done"" anything.


This really interesting trick will help you literally throw away your thoughts. Write all your troubles down on a piece of paper, discussing why they're bothering you. Then crumble it up and throw it away. Yes, throw it away! Researchers found that people who threw away their written concerns were less likely to be worried by them. ;
, So you may not be a Van Gogh, but you don't have to be to create art. All you need is a medium and a piece of paper. Have fun decorating with rainbow crayons; experiment with oil painting; get just the right shading with charcoal. Releasing your anxieties and clearing your mind through drawing can be an incredibly powerful force.

, That's not a bad a thing, necessarily, but it means that small concerns can quickly snowball into seemingly big ones overnight. In order to free your mind of worries you may be having — worries about love, stress about health, doubts about your job — learn to talk to someone.


Reach out to friends and family first. Your friends and family love you and understand you. They don't need rationalizations, and they won't sugarcoat advice. Tell them about what you're going through and listen for advice.
If your friends and family aren't the kind to lean a helping hand, consider talking to a therapist. A therapist is trained to listen to your particular concerns and find solutions based on calculated research and troves of experience. Don't feel like you're inferior for seeking the advice of a therapist.
Have a deep conversation with someone. Easier said than done — but totally worthwhile. Researchers have found that having deep conversations, in which you go beyond the superficial and share something thought-provoking or intimate, actually makes people happier., While there is no scientific evidence that owning a pet can directly help clear your mind, there is a host of evidence that is worth looking at. Owning a pet lowers your risk of depression; lowers blood pressure; elevates serotonin and dopamine; and lowers your risk of visiting the doctor if you're older than 65. If you're happier and healthier, wouldn't it also be easier to let go of things that are bothering you and embrace what you do have in your life?

, Sometimes, our minds become flooded with thoughts that, in retrospects, aren't very important. Perhaps you lost your job, or maybe your girlfriend just broke up with you. While definitely important, these things are by no means the end of the world. Remind your brain of all the truly important things that it has going for it:


Friends and family
Health and safety
Food and shelter
Opportunity and freedom

Remove contaminants from the air.,
Exchange harmful positive ions with helpful negative ions.,
Improve your mental health.,
Do not assume salt lamps will cure any medical ailments.",How to Use Himalayan Salt Lamps1," You may be wondering how a chunk of salt with a light bulb in it can clean and deodorize the air. The answer lies in a process, called hygroscopy. Himalayan salt attracts water molecules in the air and absorbs them. These water molecules carry tiny particles of dust, pollen, and smoke with them, which are deposited on the surface of the salt lamp.As the internal bulb heats the salt, the absorbed water evaporates back into the air, but the contaminants they previously carried remain stuck in the salt.
You can even fight allergy and asthma symptoms with salt lamps. Aside from dust and other everyday particles in the air, your Himalayan salt lamp will also remove pet dander, mold, and mildew from the air.;
, Many of the molecules floating around you home are positively charged. Positive ions have been associated with detrimental health effects, including a diminished ability to filter the air you breathe. However, hygroscopy - the process by which Himalayan salt cycles water molecules - not only cleans the molecules, it also changes their charge.During the absorption of water molecules from the air, Himalayan salt also removes any extra positive ions and converts them to negative ions.
These negative ions are then released independently, and may help your body filter the air you’re breathing. Note, however, that the negative ions released by salt lamps are different from those used in medical practices to help oxygenate blood.The most common sources of positive ions in contemporary homes are electronics. Accordingly, keep a salt lamp in any room that you store and use a lot of electronics - especially if you tend to leave them on.

, Salt lamps can also help you relax, and may help you maintain a positive mood. In fact, the potential for improved respiratory function and blood flow associated with negative ions may help more oxygen get to your brain. In turn, you may experience mental boosts, such as improved concentration and positive emotions.Negative ions in the air may even lead to higher amounts of serotonin in your brain, which contribute to feelings of happiness.
Use lamps to help fight seasonal affective disorder, as the ambient light offered by salt lamps can emulate sunlight.

, Claims about the health benefits of salt lamps should taken with a grain of... well, salt. For instance, halotherapy - which involves the inhalation of pulverized salt crystals and emulates breathing the air in a salt cave - is commonly said to help decrease breathlessness associate with pulmonary diseases. However, these claims are essentially unproven by medical research.In short, do not rely on salt lamps to treat a medical condition. Always seek and strongly consider the advice of a medical professional for persistent health maladies.

Learn what Qigong is.,
Find out how Qigong might be beneficial to you.,
Approach Qigong with patience.,
Educate yourself.,
Keep an open mind.,
Practice Qigong.",How to Understand Qi Gong1," The word Qi (pronounced “chee”) means “energy” and the word Gong (pronounced “gung”) means “exercise” or “practice.” It is a system that involves static postures, dynamic movements, meditation, and focus on breathing in order to learn to balance the Qi flowing through your body.Qigong believes in gathering “life force” through these different methods. It also believes that this vital life force is all around us, but that we must learn how to use it effectively.;
, The goal of Qigong is to help teach you to correct imbalances that you have gathered during your life; for example, from negative emotions such as anger, stress, and sadness, physical injuries, poor diet, and/or a lack of exercise. Practitioners believe that these imbalances can cause Qi to become stagnant in our bodies, or cause it to flow too quickly. Practicing Qigong will help you learn to balance your Qi better.You may feel skeptical about these ideas, but if you find Qigong interesting then go ahead and give it a try before you assume it doesn’t work.

, Qigong is not something you can master in a few days like you might be able to do in some other areas of your life. It is best to view it as a long-term journey. The person practicing Qigong can commit themselves to learning how to master Qi so that they are able to live longer, prevent disease, and heal themselves of any ailments.If you approach Qigong with an attitude of, “I’ll do this for a month and then all my problems will be solved” then you will find yourself very disappointed at the end of one month.

, If you were raised in the Western part of the world, you might feel skeptical about the concept of Qi, and using Qigong as a way to influence it. If you are skeptical of Qigong, but still want to learn more about it, try doing an internet search for “Qi” or “Qigong” and read everything you can find on the topic. This will help you determine for yourself whether this is something that is right for you.You could also seek out a Qigong teacher to learn more about the concept of Qi. This would also offer a good way to get any questions you may have answered. You can search for Qi instructors and therapists here.

, Qi is a concept that has been around for thousands of years. If you come from Western society it may be difficult for you to understand it. If you are interested in learning more, try to approach the concept with an open mind. If you don’t have an open mind you will never be able to understand the teachings as they don’t really conform to Western philosophies.For example, you may feel like you want someone to explain to you exactly what Qi is and how you can feel it. However, this is not really possible. Qi can be difficult to measure, but it refers to the flow of energy within the body and around the body. It can take a good deal of practice to be sensitive to Qi energy, but consistent practice is essential for anyone to sense the energy flowing into, through, and around your body.

, If you are interested in practicing Qigong in order to become more aware of your Qi, it may be very helpful to search for a skilled Qigong teacher who can guide you through a well-planned, complete practice. This doesn’t mean you have to stick with a teacher forever, but learning how to practice Qigong correctly will make a huge difference.You can find a list of Qigong teachers and therapists in the United States here.
Depending on your needs a complete practice will focus on breathing exercising, meditation, and movements meant to help you become more aware of Qi.

Follow an anti-inflammatory diet.,
Increase the amounts of vegetables and fruit in your diet.,
Increase the amount of fiber in your diet, as fiber can decrease inflammation.,
Limit red meat.,
Limit your intake of trans and saturated fats.,
Increase the amount of fish you eat.,
Make sure you include only complex carbohydrates.,
Begin exercising on a regular basis.,
Get between 75 – 300 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity.Aerobic activity is anything that increases your oxygen intake and your heart rate.",How to Use Acupressure for Weight Loss2," Certain foods can help you lose weight. In general, these are known as “anti-inflammatory” foods, which are used because having extra weight is an inflammatory condition.To follow this diet switch to organic foods as much as possible. These contain no pesticides or other chemicals, like hormones and antibiotics, that may be related to an increased risk of inflammation.


Limit the amount of processed and prepackaged food you eat as well. You want to limit the additives and preservatives that can cause some people increased inflammation if they have sensitivity to these additives and preservatives.
It may take some extra practice and planning, but the closer you can get to cooking from scratch, using whole foods that have not been processed (and therefore retain most of the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients) the healthier you will be.
A rule of thumb is that if the food is too white, like white bread, white rice, white pasta, it has been processed. Instead, eat whole grain breads, brown rice, and whole grain pasta.

, About ⅔ of your total food should be fruits, vegetables and whole grains.Fruits and vegetables contain high levels of antioxidants, which may decrease inflammation.


Choose brightly colored fruits and vegetables for the highest level of antioxidants. These include: berries (blueberries, raspberries), apples, plums, oranges and citrus fruit (Vitamin C is an excellent anti-oxidant), leafy green vegetables, both winter and summer squash, and bell peppers.
Fresh is best, but frozen vegetables and fruits can definitely be used.
Avoid eating vegetables in any sort of creamy sauces that may add fats to your diet.
Avoid fruits that have sugar or heavy syrup (with added sugars)

, You should be aiming for a minimum of 20 – 35 gm of fiber daily. High fiber foods include:


Whole grains like brown rice, bulgar wheat, buckwheat, oats, millet, quinoa.
Fruits, particularly those that you can eat with the skin — e.g. apples, pears, figs, dates, grapes, berries of all kinds.
Vegetables, especially leafy green vegetables (spinach, mustard, collard, Swiss chard, kale), carrots, broccoli, brussel sprouts, bok choy, beets
Beans and legumes including peas, lentils, all beans (kidney, black, white, lima)
Seeds including pumpkin, sesame, sunflower seeds, and nuts including almonds, pecans, walnuts and pistachio nuts

, In fact, try to limit the amount of meat you eat in general. If you do eat beef, make sure it is lean and preferably grass fed, as this meat has the natural ratio of omega-3 and omega-6 fats. If you eat poultry, make sure it is skinless and is raised without hormones or antibiotics (that goes for the red meat as well).

, The American Heart Association recommends for overall health that you avoid all trans fats and limit saturated fats to less than 7% of your total daily calories. Saturated fats are most easily avoided by avoiding butter, margarine, and shortening in your cooking.


Use olive oil or canola oil instead.
Trim the fats off any meats.
Avoid any food that has “partially hydrogenated fats” on the label. These may contain trans fats, even if the label says “0 trans fats”

, Fish is good quality protein and has good amounts of the healthier omega-3 fats. Higher omega-3 fat intake is associated with a decreased level of inflammation. Fish with higher levels of omega-3 fats include: salmon, tuna, trout, sardines and mackerel.

, If you avoid processed foods, you have essentially included only complex carbohydrates. The processing of food breaks down the carbohydrates into the simple carbohydrates. High amounts of simple carbohydrates can increase the levels of inflammation.

, Eating well, eating less, and exercising is the only real way to lose weight and to keep it off. However, the exercise doesn’t have to be, and shouldn’t be, a difficult chore. Start slow by walking more often. Park the car far away, use stairs instead of escalators or elevators, walk the dog, or just plain take a walk! If you want, join a gym and find a fitness coach.


Lift weights, do cardiovascular workouts, use an elliptical, whatever you enjoy and will stick with.
Make sure you talk to your physician and make sure you know what you should and shouldn’t be doing. Don’t push it too hard, just push it a bit!
Find an activity that you enjoy and that fits well into your life. Don’t overdo it, because workouts that are too strenuous can cause you to stop doing them.Try using a pedometer to track and monitor how many steps you take through the day. Gradually increase this number over time to increase your activity level.

, Examples include running, swimming, hiking, walking, jogging, dancing, martial arts and cycling.


These can also be done inside, using exercise equipment such as stationary bikes and ellipticals, or outside, in a park or in your neighborhood."

Look at using essential oils.,
Investigate herbal remedies.,
Look into eating different foods.,
Consider using holistic doctors.",How to Use Natural Remedies1," Many people find relief using essential oils to treat everything from headaches to bug bites. For example, some oils have analgesic results when used on the skin (relieving pain) or anti-inflammatory effects on muscles. For example, chamomile essential oil has been known to stop headaches and muscle spasms related to PMS.
Lavender essential oil is commonly used to treat insomnia because its scent promotes relaxation.
Peppermint essential oil is often used to relieve headaches and muscle aches because of its anti-inflammatory properties. (This oil should be avoided around children under age 6.)
Essential oils should be diluted with a carrier oil like olive oil or coconut oil and rubbed onto the skin. It is very important to only use two or three drops at a time, and to always use them with a carrier oil to keep them from irritating your skin. Do research before using them on children.;
, Herbs are another treatment option that many people use. Most kitchens are stocked with herbs for cooking, making them cheap and easy to access.For example, the spice turmeric can relieve muscle soreness because it reduces the enzyme that causes arthritis swelling.
Another useful herb is ginger, which is often used to reduce nausea. Its properties block serotonin and free radical production, both of which cause an upset stomach.
Garlic has a host of benefits, including reducing blood pressure, promoting cardiovascular health, and preventing strokes.
Most herbal remedies can be diluted into water (like when making tea) or added to healthy dishes (like a salad). Many, however, can be purchased in capsule form and swallowed like vitamin tablets.

, Herbs are not the only things you can eat or swallow that can provide a cure to physical ailments. Different foods, when consumed more frequently when you need relief, can bring quick physical aid. Although food is often more helpful as a preventive measure, some foods can provide relief in a day or so.For example, yogurt, when eaten without added sugars, can aid digestive health and reduce gas.
Dark brown honey can relieve a cough (though don’t use this solution for babies under the age of 12 months). Two teaspoons diluted into a cup of tea is an effective way to consume honey.
Orange juice can resolve afternoon drowsiness and renew your energy.

, Holistic doctors (or alternative medicine) are especially good at treating musculoskeletal pain and relieving it quickly. Many patients turn to homeopathic doctors to solve immediate physical ailments, finding relief without having to deal with the side effects of medications. Sometimes these treatments can even find the root cause of pain, resolving pain so that it does not return.You will need to find a holistic practitioner in your area, and a session can cost anywhere from $20 to $100 an hour or more. Check with your health insurance before going, as a growing number of holistic alternatives (like chiropractors) are starting to be covered.
Holistic medicine includes chiropractic, acupuncture, massage, and physical therapy, among others.

Place your forehead on the floor with your hands flat on the floor. Try to lean into the pose, and focus on your breathing. Hold this pose for about 5 minutes., Sit on the floor. Have your legs straight out in front of you. Lean forward, stretching towards your feet. If it hurts, try bending your knees a bit. Stay in the position for about 5 minutes., These types of position take much of your attention, as you're trying to balance. Therefore, they help clear your mind.One such position is called tree. Start with both legs on the ground. Push to balance on one leg. Bring up the other leg to about knee-level, letting your heel point upward. The bottom of your foot should be resting on the inside of your other leg. Make sure you are balanced, then either bring your hands together (flat-palmed) at chest level or raise your arms out to the sky. Count each breath, holding the pose until you reach 10; then move to the other leg., This pose is very simple; you just lay down flat on the floor, face up.

Try mindfulness exercises.,
Try a self-compassion break.,
Treat yourself as a friend.,
Practice mindfulness in daily activities.",How to Calm an Overactive Mind4," Mindfulness is a lot like taking meditation into everyday life. Except, instead of focusing on your breathing, you're focusing on everything that happens to you without passing judgment. So, for instance, instead of letting your mind wander away while you're drinking a cup of coffee, you focus on each sip, savoring the flavor and warmth., Bring a stressful situation in your current life to mind. Acknowledge that it is painful. You could say something like ""This situation is causing me suffering,"" or ""I find this painful.""Connect your suffering to others. Basically, you're acknowledging that suffering is part of life and that you are not alone in what you feel. You could say ""Suffering happens to everyone,"" or ""All of us feel pain from time to time.""Place your hands on your chest, and feel their weight there. Acknowledge that you need to be kind to yourself and not beat yourself up. You could say, ""I should be kind to myself,"" or ""May I be compassionate to myself.""

, If you think about, you may be easier on your friends than you are on yourself. Often, you're your own worst critic. However, you can use a mindfulness exercise to help change how you treat yourself.Get out something to write on. Bring to mind a time when a friend was struggling or felt bad about herself. Write down how you responded or tried to help.Now bring to mind a similar situation you faced. Write down how you responded to yourself.Notice if the responses are different. Question why they are different, and what anxieties lead to them being different. Employ that knowledge the next time you're feeling bad by responding to yourself as you would your friend., With each activity you do in a day, you have the opportunity to be mindful. That is, you have the opportunity to be truly present, to pay attention to what you're doing and feeling.For instance, while you're showering, you can pay attention to rubbing the shampoo in your hair, the sensation of your fingers on your scalp. You can feel the soap as you rub it into your body.
While eating, you can make sure you are tasting each bite, savoring the flavors.
Every time your mind wanders, bring it back to what you're doing."

Try walking meditation.,
Still your eyes.,
Try breathing exercises.,
Try different forms of meditation.,
Once you've begun meditating, learn to deepen your meditation skills.Once you've gotten a hang of the basics of meditation, learn how to enhance the effects of your efforts.",How to Clear Your Mind2," Walking meditation is exactly what it sounds: Using the openness and beauty of nature to inspire calm, positive thoughts in the brain. Be like Henry David Thoreau, walking through the wilderness and planning the site of your cabin-to-be. Or imagine you're Carl Linnaeus, the Swedish scientist, who classified many plants and animals. Being outside on a warm sunny day can do wonders for your disposition.

, This is a meditation technique that helps you clear your mind by obliterating your sense of time. Here's how to do it:


Focus your eyes on one point in the distance. Any stationary object about 10 feet (3.0 m) away works best; objects that are too far away are harder to focus on for longer periods of time. The object could be a wall, a vase, a speck of dirt — as long as it's not moving.
Dim your conscious mind and continue to focus on the object. Your brainpower is all being channeled toward one task. Continue focusing on the object, even if your eyes begin to stray or your mind begins to wander.
After a certain point, time will begin to slow. You'll be in the zone. Your concentration will not waver. You won't begin to worry about what was once worrying you because your concentration is 100% devoted to maintaining its gaze on the object. When you're ready, relax your concentration. Your mind should feel a little worn out, like it's just gone through mental calisthenics. You should feel better.

, Breathing is an essential part of meditation, which can be an essential part of clearing your mind. Mastering several different breathing techniques can help you achieve the open-minded clarity that comes with transcendence. Master this quick breathing technique — the complete breath— in order to better master meditation:


Standing up straight, exhale completely.
Relax your belly muscles as you begin to inhale. Concentrate on filling your belly with air.
Once your belly is completely filled with air, keep on breathing, expanding your chest and rib cage.
Momentarily hold your breath, fighting the instinct to exhale.
Exhale slowly — as slowly as possible. Feel the air moving out of your lips.
Relax your chest and rib cage, pulling in your belly in order to force out any remaining air.
Close your eyes, concentrate on your normal breathing, and clear your mind.
Repeat process for 5 to 30 minutes.

, There are many ways to skin a cat, and not all of them involve a knife. Learn the different forms of meditation, everything from mantra meditation to zen meditation.

, There are several ways to do this:


Relax the body completely. Make sure your body isn't unconsciously tensing up while you descend into mindlessness. Try tensing your body purposely, and then releasing the tension. Repeat this exercise until you know that your body is completely relaxed.
Try staying completely still while you meditate. It's hard achieving a state of enlightened mindlessness when your body is moving, sending sensation and demanding response from your brain. Make an effort to stay completely still.
Let your breathing flow naturally. After some initial breathing exercises, let go of the conscious exertion of your breath. Let it do what it wants. Focus your awareness out into the farther points of your body, and by doing so, eliminate that awareness.

Play sports or make a game out of something.,
Challenge yourself to an open-ended task.",How to Clear Your Mind3," Sometimes, clearing your mind is about distracting yourself from negative thoughts that creep into your consciousness. Nothing is more distracting than playing an absorbing game or making a game out of ordinary routine.


Getting physical exercise by playing sports is a great way to feel better and take your mind off whatever is bothering you. On top of that, physical activity is a great way to cure physiological ailments and soothe psychological disorders.Make a game out of whatever ordinary activity you are performing at the time. Have to organize your room? Make a game out of it by shooting dirty laundry into your hamper. Have to run errands? Challenge yourself to be frugal and spend half of what you normally spend.

, They say that idle hands are the devil's workshop, so the best thing that you can do to keep your mind clear is keep your hands occupied. Your metaphorical hands. And challenging yourself to an open-ended task is a great way to do that. Here are some ideas that you can try out to stay busy:


Take a picture of yourself every day for a year. You're probably seen the montage videos by now — the succession of pictures accompanied by music, chronicling the life of a human being in pictures. It's a great idea, and anyone can try it. But you need patience and persistence to do it every day for a year.
Do something you're afraid of — every day. This was Eleanor Roosevelt's famous advice, and one that strikes a chord with many people. Maybe you're afraid of interacting with other people. (Many people share this fear.) Go out and stop a stranger for directions, and then strike up a conversation. You'll slowly begin to conquer your fear, helping your mind realize that it can let go of other troubles, as well.

Keep salt lamps in each room you spend a lot of time in.,
Place a salt lamp in your living room.,
Keep a salt lamp in your bedroom.,
See particular advantages in the winter.",How to Use Himalayan Salt Lamps2," Aside from providing clean, easy-to-breathe air, salt lamps can also help you feel energized throughout the day. In order to receive these benefits, however, you’ll likely need multiple salt lamps.Have you ever felt refreshed during a visit to the beach, standing next to a waterfall, or simply in the shower? Each of these expose you to negative ions that are effectively the same as those generated by Himalayan salt lamps.
The shift won’t be immediate, but you’ll likely feel more energized about a week after installing lamps in the rooms where you spend a lot of your day.

, Especially if you store electronics in your living room, it’s worth featuring salt lamps as well. Since large electronics in particular emit plenty of positive ions, it can be beneficial to place salt lamps right next to computers or televisions.If you work in an environment that will allow it, place a salt lamp near your work computer as well.

, One of the most advantageous locations to place a salt lamp is your bedroom. This is in part because concentrations of positive ions can diminish your quality of sleep. The negative ions dispersed by your salt lamp, however, can help remove these positive ions and encourage oxygen supply to your brain.If the light emitted by the candle keeps you up, consider placing the lamp outside of your line of sight. You can also leave the candle on during the day to filter the air, and turn it off during the night.

, The air in your home is probably especially dirty and positively charged during the winter months. This is largely because closed windows means air is circulating much less than it does when it’s warm out.Not only can salt lamps be especially useful in cleaning indoor winter air, they can also help prevent you from getting sick from the cold and flu viruses that are also more common during the chillier months.

Purchase high quality Himalayan salt lamps.,
Get a big enough salt lamp.,
Watch out for copious sweating.,
Clean your lamp and check for build up.,
Use a Himalayan salt candle holder.",How to Use Himalayan Salt Lamps3," You will receive the greatest benefits from a lamp that is made of pure, food grade Himalayan salt. The light fixture itself should also be solid and made of high quality components. This will help prevent potential electrical risks involved with salt and liquid deposits within the lamp.There are a lot of fake, cheap “salt” lamps for sale. Check the country of origin. The salt itself should have originated in Pakistan, though assembly elsewhere can be okay.
Note that a real Himalayan salt lamp will provide dim, uneven light, will be rather fragile, and will feel damp to the touch sometimes.

, For an average bedroom, a roughly 5 lb (2.3 kg) salt lamp is sufficient. In a living room-type space, go for a larger lamp. Twelve pound (5.4kg) lamps are perfect for these spaces.As a rule of thumb, choose a lamp with one pound of salt crystal per sixteen square feet of floor space. If a room has high ceilings, choose a lamp with extra weight.
Note that multiples lamps will be equally effective as a large lamp. For instance, two six-pound lamps (2.7 kg each) can offer the same benefits as a twelve pound (5.4kg) lamp.

, One issue you may have to deal with is excessive sweating from your lamp. While a hot lamp will cause most of the moisture the salt absorbs to evaporate, the lamp may sweat water in especially damp climate. To prevent a sweating lamp from damaging the surface on which it sits, place a wooden coaster or ceramic dish beneath the lamp.Your lamp will also likely sweat when you turn it off, as there is no heat to promote evaporation. If you do not wish to leave the lamp on 24 hours a day, definitely place a coaster or something else to catch water underneath your lamp. Be sure to empty and replace anything you leave beneath a lamp that has collected water before turning the lamp back on.
Consider using a higher-wattage bulb in your lamp to promote more evaporation. Check the fixture's specifications for the maximum wattage, which will likely be located on the bulb’s receptacle.

, Your lamp will need to be cleaned from time to time, especially if it’s successfully pulling lots of dust and other particles from the air. Turn off the lamp and allow it to cool down, then wipe the lamp with a moist lint-free cloth or sponge. More importantly, ensure that liquid and salt have not built up within the lamp, as this can lead to dangerous electrical discharges.You will likely notice debris wiping off of the surface of the salt crystal. Once the crystal appears clean, turn it back on to evaporate any remaining moisture.
You can also use a dry, lint-free cloth to dry the crystal whenever you notice it is sweating. Doing this will also help clean the salt and prevent liquid accumulation beneath the lamp.

, As an alternative to electric salt lamps, you can also get blocks of Himalayan salt sculpted to hold tea candles. These are cheaper, just as visually appealing, and as effective as electronic options - though they are often smaller. For an especially relaxing (and refreshing) effect, place multiple salt crystal candle holders around your bathroom or bedroom.

Use medical Qigong to heal yourself.,
Sharpen your martial arts skills with Qigong.,
Become enlightened through spiritual Qigong.",How to Understand Qi Gong2," Though there may be many forms of Qi Gong, all of these forms fit within three types. One of these types is medical Qigong. Medical Qigong is the most popular, and also the oldest type. Medical Qigong focuses on movement and breathing to help promote self-healing.


Within this type of Qigong there are two sub-types: self-healing Qigong and external Qigong (also called Qi Emission). Self-healing Qigong will allow you to practice Qigong to heal your own ailments. External Qigong will allow a Qigong healer to influence the Qi of other people in order to help heal them.You can use Qigong movements to promote self-healing. If you become skilled in using Qi, you can use your skills to help heal others.

, Martial Qigong is used by practitioners to improve their physical capacities. You have probably seen movies where martial artists break bricks with their hands or pull of other impressive physical tasks, and practicing martial Qigong allows these martial artists to learn how to use Qi to accomplish these things.Don’t think that you will be able to break a brick with your bare hands after a couple of weeks of practicing. Martial Qigong requires a very disciplined student and years of practice.

, Spiritual Qigong uses meditation, mantras, hand positions, and prayers in pursuit of reaching enlightenment. While this may sound like the most relaxing type of Qigong, this type probably requires the most effort and discipline as those who practice spiritual Qigong must train their Qi to a much deeper level.The main goals of this type of Qigong are to teach the student discipline in order to become more self-aware, tranquil, and harmonious with their own bodies.

Get a massage from a Qigong healer.,
Have an acupuncture treatment.,
Receive Qi emission.,
Have an object empowered.",How to Understand Qi Gong3," This might not be the type of massage you are used to hearing about, but a “massage” from a Qigong healer will involve the healer touching your body using massage, accupressure, or just touch. The purpose of this treatment is to identify blockages in your body that might be causing your Qi to become stagnant, or where Qi may be flowing too quickly.


Qigong can be great for fixing ""blockages"" that prevent Qi from flowing freely through the body., During an acupuncture treatment, a Qi healer will insert thin, sterilized needles into the skin. Where these needles are inserted will depend on the problems you are having. Before you begin your acupuncture session, your Qi healer will gather information about you by asking you questions and by examining your body. Depending on your reasons for seeking acupuncture, you may need several treatments spread over a period of time.Acupuncture can be very beneficial for people who struggle with pain and even those suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).Other ailments that seem to respond well to acupuncture include (but are not limited to): headaches, back pain, depression, chronic nausea, sciatica, and rheumatoid arthritis., This type of healing involves having a Qi healer hold their hands a few inches above the patient’s body. They then use Qi to balance channels of energy, smoothing out imbalances and helping to remove negative influences.


Research into this type of healing appears that this type of healing can have a positive impact on the patient., Another method of receiving treatment from a Qigong healer involves having an object, such as a precious metal, a stone, or drinking or bathing water empowered. You might also ask a Qigong healer about teas and other herbal formulas that can help to balance your Qi and remove negative influences."

Understand the basic concepts of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).,
Understand how acupressure can be used to stimulate weight loss.,
Learn how to apply pressure on acupressure points.",How to Use Acupressure for Weight Loss3," Acupressure and acupuncture utilize various points along 12 basic meridians in the body. These meridians are energy pathways, which are believed to carry “qi” or “chi”, the Chinese terms for life energy. The basic concept is that illness is caused by a blockage in qi. The needles in acupuncture and the pressure in acupressure can unblock these energy pathways and restore the easy and unimpeded flow of qi.

, In TCM, weight loss can be encouraged by allowing excess “heat” and “moisture” to be expelled and by supporting the organs of digestion.The terms “heat” and “moisture” don’t necessarily have literal meanings. In other words, applying pressure at these points won’t significantly change the temperature of the skin or cause any dampness on the skin. The terms should be understood to indicate imbalances of energy that are viewed as heat and moisture.Some studies have indicated that acupressure on the ear points in particular can significantly help people achieve weight loss.Another somewhat related technique, the Tapas Acupressure Technique, has shown some positive results for maintaining weight loss, though no significant results for weight loss., Unless the point is on the center of your body, make sure you apply pressure on both sides for the same amount of time. The amount of pressure is generally light to medium-- find a level of pressure you are comfortable with. Never press hard.


Think of three levels of pressure — light pressure is the amount of pressure it would take for your finger to depress your skin slightly and moves the skin around the pressure point slightly. You won’t feel a pulse or bone —but will feel a muscle moving under the skin. Medium pressure depresses the skin more — and in areas where the skin is thin (e.g. around the ear) you should feel some bone and will feel joints and muscle moving. You may also feel a pulse around (for example) around the knee, elbow or ankle points.
You can apply acupressure anywhere: at work, at school, at home, or after (or during) a shower. Though it is usually best to be in a quiet and peaceful environment, it is not absolutely necessary.

Investigate essential oils.,
Consider herbal prevention.,
Eat specific foods.,
Take vitamins.,
Use alternative practitioners.",How to Use Natural Remedies2," You can use essential oils to prevent illness. To use essential oils as prevention, you can apply them to your skin on a daily basis, or at least 3 or 4 times a week. In fact, some say the best way is to dilute them in a carrier oil and rub them on the bottoms of the feet at bedtime to generally boost the immune system.A carrier oil is a basic oil like olive oil or coconut oil, and you mix one or two drops of essential with it before rubbing it into your skin. Essential oils are very powerful, and diluting them in other oil prevents them from irritating your skin.
Oils that are good to rub on your feet at night to boost the immune system include lavender, lemon, pine needle, and tea tree. Use one at a time or a combination of two or three, but do not exceed four drops on each foot with the carrier oil.
Use half this amount on children, and make sure it is safe to use each oil on a child. Most oils are safe after age 6, but certain oils like eucalyptus and peppermint should not be used on young children.
Don’t bathe for 7 hours after applying the oil so that you get the full benefits.
Essential oils can be found in many locations, such as vitamin stores, drug stores, health food stores, or from individuals who sell them from home.

, Herbs can be a very effective way to prevent illness. When you consume herbs on a regular basis, you are able to boost your immune system. In fact, herbs have been used for hundreds of years as preventive measures for illness.Many herbs have been shown to prevent cancer: turmeric may prevent colon cancer, rosemary may stop tumors from growing, and holy basil may prevent breast cancer.
Herbs also have a reputation for improving heart health: cinnamon lowers cholesterol, ginger lowers blood pressure, and garlic improves the cardiovascular system as a whole.

, Food and weight have always played a major role in our overall health. Having a healthy weight prevents many of the health problems that come with obesity, such as increased cholesterol and risk of heart disease. Eating the right foods can also help you prevent cancer and other diseases.For example, eating foods rich in antioxidants like berries, spinach, and beans can prevent free radicals from overwhelming your system and growing tumors.
Eat lean meats and whole grains to prevent iron deficiency., If you are eating a balanced diet, you don’t need a lot of vitamin supplements. But many of us don’t eat a perfectly balanced diet. A diet severely deficient in vitamins can allow your body to break down faster so that you end up with things like joint pain and skin discoloration. Taking vitamins can prevent a breakdown of health.For example, vitamin B12 deficiency can cause numbness, weakness, fatigue, and difficulty walking.

, Holistic medicine, such as at a chiropractor, acupuncturist, massage therapist, or other practitioner, can prevent your body from experiencing pain. For example, most chiropractors like to treat patients on a monthly basis to prevent pain from returning.

Find out how essential oils may help.,
Consider how herbs can change your mood.,
Eat for mental health.,
Take vitamin supplements to boost your mood.,
Seek holistic alternatives for mental clarity.",How to Use Natural Remedies3," Your physical body isn’t the only part of you that can benefit from natural remedies. People take medications for ailments of the mind like anxiety and depression, and essential oils can be used for mental problems as well. The aroma of many different oils can boost your mood and clear your mind.Oils like bergamot, frankincense, and lavender may banish the blues of depression.
Anxiety may be relieved with many different oils, but one reliable mixture is lavender, ylang ylang, and bergamot.
Clary sage may clear your mind and make you feel calm.
The aromatherapy practice of essential oils includes several different mediums. You can put a few drops on a piece of cloth and hold it to your nose; you can place a few drops in an essential oil diffuser, which is a small version of a cool mist humidifier; or you can place a few drop of oil in boiling water or a bowl of dry rice.

, Specific herbs can help you feel better if you are depressed or feeling stressed. Herbs for mental health can be taken as both extracts (usually dropped into a tea) or in pill form as supplements. Not all herbs do this, but if you find the right ones, you may start improving your quality of life.For example, the extract of holy basil (usually available in health food stores) can be added to tea and sipped at home. Holy basil reduces stress by increasing adrenaline and decreasing serotonin levels.
St. John’s wort can help boost mood and relieve anxiety because of the phytochemical hypericin. Just alert your doctor before use because it can interact with several medications.

, Food has a profound effect on the way we feel and think. When you eat a lot of simple sugars, blood sugar spikes may wreck your mood. On the other hand, the complex carbs of whole grains and the steady energy from lean protein levels your blood sugar supply. Likewise omega 3 fatty acids have been shown to reduce symptoms of schizophrenia and depression. In general, what we eat may be an important part of treating mental troubles.Whole grains such as oats, brown rice, and barley may be good for the mind.
Lean protein like chicken and turkey provide amino acids for the brain to use. Turkey’s famous by-product, tryptophan, produces serotonin.
Omega 3 fatty acids can be found in foods like fish and walnuts.

, Low levels of specific vitamins are linked to mood disorders like depression. For example, vitamin D deficiency is key for bone health, but it is also important because the brain actually contains vitamin D receptors and they are located in areas of the brain associated with depression., Exercise in general helps to relieve stress, and when you couple this with the body mechanics that are encouraged at most holistic practitioners, you are assured some release of stress. For example, massage therapy uses human touch to relieve tension in muscles, but also releases emotional tension."

Think through your anxiety.,
Use cognitive distancing.,
Tell yourself what you think isn't the whole truth.,
Learn to label your thoughts.,
Stop your own criticisms.,
Use bathing or showering to calm your mind.,
Learn to be grateful.",How to Calm an Overactive Mind5," Instead of letting anxiety throw you for a loop, let it guide you. Ask yourself three questions when you find yourself anxious: First, ask yourself what you can learn from your anxiety. Next, ask yourself what your mind is trying to say to you through its anxiety. Finally, ask what you can do to resolve the situation.For instance, say you're worrying about a job interview. This kind of anxiety can teach you that you find social situations nerve-wracking, and you may want to give yourself more time to prepare in the future. It could also be that your mind is trying to tell you you're not as prepared as you need to be, and you need to spend more time researching.

, Your mind is basically working itself up over nothing. That is, it's predicting that bad things will happen. However, you can balance out your mind's tendency to come up with negative scenarios by coming up with positive ones instead.For instance, consider the likeliness of negative scenario actually happening. Yes, you could be mugged because you're out after dark, but incidents are relatively rare.
Think about positive outcomes instead or at least non-negative ones. If you had an interview and you're worried you did badly, think about what could happen. Maybe you didn't do as badly as you think, and you'll get a call back. However, even if you did do badly and you don't get the job, you learned from the experience and can do better on the next one.
Analyze what's most likely to happen. Most of the time, the worst-case scenario your brain came up with is not likely to happen.

, Your brain puts together facts and ideas and mixes them with your experiences and thoughts. What goes on your brain isn't the objective truth that everyone else sees. Therefore, when you're having negative thoughts, step back from them a second see if what you perceive as a threat is really as bad as it seems; sometimes, your mind is just reacting instinctively.For instance, say you're looking around the room, and someone looks away as soon as you look at her. You may perceive this action as an affront. However, it could be just as likely that she was turning her head just as you came to her, and she didn't see you at all.

, One way to realize how negatively your thinking is to start labeling your thoughts. For instance, the next time you say ""My hair looks awful,"" label that as ""judgmental."" Alternatively, the next time you say, ""I hope my kid doesn't have a bicycle accident,"" label that as a ""worry."" Once you begin to see how much you worry or judge, you may realize you want to change those thoughts into something else.For instance, if you catch yourself saying, ""I hope my kid doesn't have a bicycle accident,"" you can tell yourself that you've done everything you can to make her safe on her bicycle (by providing safety gear and giving her a safe place to ride), and now you have to stop worrying and enjoy spending time with your kid.

, Often, you will be your own worst enemy. You may be criticizing yourself when no one is. If you can stop that criticism and turn it around, you can help slow down your overactive mind.For instance, if you find yourself thinking something negative about your body, try to turn it into something positive. You could say, ""I don't like the way my legs look. But they are strong, and they've carried me through many trials.""

, Sometimes, just hopping in the shower in and of itself will help calm your mind. However, it also helps to add a cleansing ritual to it. For instance, as you shower, think about everything you are worried about being sucked down the drain, meaning you don't have to hold on to those worries anymore., Sometimes, the only way to refocus an overactive mind is to turn it to what's good rather than focusing on what's bad. For instance, take some time each day to write down a couple of things you're grateful for. Alternatively, if you find your mind going off the rails, take a few minutes to think about the people and things in your life that you love and are grateful for."

Watch for jumping to conclusions.,
Pay attention to your mental filter.,
Look out for overgeneralization.,
Watch for all-or-nothing thinking.,
Make sure you're not catastrophizing.,
Understand these aren't the only cognitive distortions.",How to Calm an Overactive Mind6," Sometimes, your brain will jump to what it thinks is a logical conclusion, often a bad one. However, much of the time, that conclusion isn't correct. This type of thinking can lead to your brain working overtime, so learning how to notice it and change that thinking can help calm your mind.For instance, you may notice that you automatically think someone is snubbing you because she didn't invite you to lunch. Your mind jumped to that conclusion. However, it may be that she just didn't realize you were in your office.When you make a snap judgment, ask yourself if there could be another explanation.

, Your brain may latch on to the one negative part of an interaction or situation. In reality, it may be just a small part of the interaction that no one else pays attention to, but you hyper-focus on it, coloring everything negative. If you do this type of thinking all the time, your brain will be overactive, so trying to turn this filter off can help calm your mind.For instance, maybe you've made a meal for your family. Everyone seems to love it, except one of your kids, who makes a snide remark. Instead of focusing on the fact that everyone else loves it, you hyper-focus on the negative remark, wondering what you could have done better.Instead of looking for negativity, try to focus on the positive, especially if it far outweighs the negativity., You may also find yourself overgeneralizing from one incident. In other words, you had something bad happen once in a certain situation, so you decide to never put yourself or someone else in that situation again. If you overgeneralize everything, you're constantly thinking about what bad thing is going to happen next; to calm your mind, you need to learn to turn off this kind of thinking.For instance, say your kid cuts himself on a knife while helping you in the kitchen. You may decide that the best thing is to never let him help again to keep him safe, when really, he likely will learn from the experience and be more careful in the future. Maybe a more logical response would be to go over knife safety with him again.In other words, don't let one bad incident make up your mind, especially if you've had positive experiences in the past.

, This type of thinking can cause you to see everything as failure. It goes hand-in-hand with a perfectionist mentality; if you can't do something perfectly, than it's a failure. This type of thinking can make your mind overactive because you're always looking for your next mistake, so learning not to think this way can calm your mind down.For instance, say you have promised yourself that you are going to exercise everyday, and then you miss a day. If you're an all-or-nothing thinker, you may decide your exercise program is ruined and give up.Be forgiving of yourself. Not every situation is going to be perfect, and you're going to make mistakes. Give yourself permission to start over again with a clean slate., Basically, this type of cognitive distortion is always thinking the worst will happen. You might find yourself maximizing insignificant mistakes to justify the thought that the worst is coming. On the other hand, you might find yourself minimizing something to justify the same conclusion. Similar to other types of cognitive distortions, you'll find that this type of thinking has your brain going 24/7 thinking the worse, so turning this type of thinking off will help you calm down your mind.For instance, you might decide that because you forgot to send your kid's lunch to school, he's going to go hungry, and then he might eat someone else's lunch that has a peanut butter sandwich in it (which he's allergic to). You worry he might have an allergic reaction and die.Alternatively, maybe you decide that your friend (who has an impeccable driving record) isn't a good driver because she accidentally made a U-turn where she wasn't supposed to, and you use that to justify not riding with her because you don't want to get in a car crash.Look at each of the situations realistically. For instance, your kid is likely to remember he's allergic to peanuts, and even if he does accidentally eat some, a nurse is on hand at school to help deal with the situation. Alternatively, don't let your friend's one mistake ruin her whole record; everyone makes mistakes, and she's obviously a pretty good driver if she has a good record.

, Your mind is always willing to play tricks on you. Therefore, you should always take the time to step back from the situation and see if what you're thinking is really objective or true when your mind is on overdrive.

If a tea, steep five to 10 minutes for leaves and flowers and 10–20 minutes for roots, and drink two to four cups a day.

Cranberry — 400 mg twice daily — Cranberry helps to fight H. pylori infections by preventing the bacteria from attaching to tissues. Cranberry juice and pills are both effective.Mastic extract – 1,000-2,000 mg daily, taken in two to three doses – Has been shown to inhibit the growth of H. pylori bacteria.DGL-licorice extract – 250-500 mg, three times daily – Licorice reduces inflammation and fights H. pylori bacteria.DGL is licorice without glycyrrhizin — a chemical with negative side effects.
Peppermint — one .2 ml enteric-coated tablet, two to three times daily or as a tea after meals – Peppermint soothes the stomach and fights H. pylori bacteria.Ginger — Ginger helps to prevent ulcers and to reduce the amount of H. pylori in your gut. You can take it by chewing on fresh ginger, boiling it and drinking the liquid, or adding ginger powder to a drink., Regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen, is one of the major causes of gastritis.Try switching to another pain reliever, like acetaminophen, that causes less irritation. If you are still having problems, ask your doctor about other pain reliever choices., Gastritis can be aggravated by eating heavily processed, fried, or very spicy foods. If you can, cook your own food from fresh ingredients, and avoid:

Get a diagnosis.,
Take medications to tackle stomach acid.,
Get treatment for a Helicobacter pylori infection.",How to Treat Gastritis3," Your doctor will examine you and perform some tests in order to make a diagnosis. He or she will take your medical history and listen to your abdomen with a stethoscope.Be sure to describe your symptoms accurately and precisely to your doctor. He or she may recommend you have a blood test, a stool test, and/or a breathe test. These three tests can check for H. pylori infections as well as other potential causes and contributory factors.

In some cases your doctor might decide to perform an endoscopy. This is an examination which involves inserting a small tube, called an endoscope, down your esophagus and into your stomach. The endoscope has a camera to visualize lesions, and the ability to take biopsies to check for infections or other abnormal stomach conditions.
An alternative to an endoscopy is a barium swallow and X-Ray. This not as invasive, but is less accurate., Depending on your diagnosis, you will be prescribed medication which will relieve your symptoms by reducing the amount of acid in your stomach. This will allow the stomach lining to heal. The two major types of medication prescribed are:


H-2 blockers — Cimetidine (Tagamet),Ranitidine (Zantac),Nizatidine (Axid),and Famotidine (Pepcid)all work by lowering the amount of acid released into your digestive tract.Proton pump inhibitors — Esomeprazole (Nexium),Lansoprazole (Prevacid),Omeprazole (Prilosec),Pantoprazole (Protonix),and Rabeprazole (AcipHex)also lower acid levels in the gut. Some are available by prescription only, and some can be obtained over the counter.
Always follow the directions on the package or your doctor's instructions when taking medication. Do not take more than the recommended dose unless advised to do so by your doctor.

, An H. pylori infection is the leading cause of gastritis. If you have been diagnosed with one, your doctor will prescribe you a regimen of drugs to tackle the infection. This treatment is known as H. pylori eradication therapy, and generally involves taking a course of drugs which include two antibiotics as well as a proton pump inhibitor to reduce stomach acid and allow your stomach lining to heal.If you are prescribed a course of medication, be sure to take the full amount and continue taking the drugs until the end of the course.
For an H. pylori infection, you will typically have to take the medications for 10-14 days."

Be aware some centers prohibit smokers.",How to Undergo Salt Therapy2," Salt has multiple healing properties. It is considered antibacterial and anti-inflammatory. It is believed to help reduce mucus and remove pollutants., Salt therapy mimics what happens in natural salt caves. Walls and floors are covered with layers of salt, then a dry salt aerosol is released into the room. This creates an environment that is antibacterial and which has negative ions.Salt rooms use both Himalayan, Red Sea, and Dead Sea salt., Salt therapy is a holistic treatment for many different conditions, most commonly respiratory conditions. It is believed to help improve lung function by removing toxins from the lungs and sinuses. It also helps with asthma, COPD, and allergies.Salt therapy is believed to help clean your nostrils and sinuses.It may also help reduce your snoring.
Be aware that while some scientific research has supported the effectiveness of salt therapy and many doctors advocate for it, many do not.

Many believe, however, it does not do any damage., Salt therapy is believed to help and relieve symptoms of skin conditions. These conditions include eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis, and acne., Salt therapy may help strengthen your immune system. This can help keep you from catching a cold and the flu.Salt therapy is extremely relaxing, so it can relieve stress and help promote calm., Salt therapy is used to enhance performance of both athletes and vocal performers.

They may have treatments that are tailored to people with such anxieties, such as floatation rooms with high vault ceilings for people who experience claustrophobia. If you are scared of drowning, they will probably tell that the treatment is very safe since you are lying in very shallow water.Inquire: “Do you have any treatments that are better for people with claustrophobia?”
The pods usually have good air quality. However, if you are worried about being able to breath in the pod, you might ask: “Will there be adequate air circulation the pod?”If you fall asleep in the chamber, the salty water will wake you up., The goal of floatation therapy is to completely relax your body and mind.

Back up against a wall.,
Notice what touches the wall.,
Step away and hold your positioning.,
Remind yourself of the benefits.,
Practice good posture habits.,
Exercise with shoulder-blade pumps.,
Try chin tucks and drops.,
Strengthen your pectorals.",How to Stand Up Straight," If you can find a spot of floor and wall that are flat and roughly perpendicular, you can easily assess your current posture and reset your body into a proper alignment.Stand facing away from the wall, and slowly back up until you are standing in solid contact with it (but not leaning against it).
Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, flat on the floor beneath you, and a few inches off the wall.;
, Ideally, you want three contact points between your body and the wall: the back of your head, your shoulder blades, and your buttocks.If you have poor standing posture, you may find that your mid-back (perhaps along with your buttocks) touches the wall first.
Although less common, some people lean back too far instead of slouching forward, in which case your head alone may touch the wall first.
If you are not making contact with your head, shoulder blades, and buttocks, reorient your upper body without moving your feet so that you are in a proper standing position.

, Once you get a feel for standing up straight against the wall, try walking away while maintaining your proper upper-body posture.Before long, your body will want to revert to its former, familiar positioning. Try to focus on how proper positioning feels so that you can maintain it as long as possible.
Once you feel the “slouch” returning, go back against the wall to re-establish your posture.

, It is not a complicated process for most people to improve their posture, but it does take time and effort. It can be tempting to just go back to your familiar “hunch,” but keep in mind why it is well worth it to make the change.Although you may think of slouching as being more relaxed, it actually makes your muscles work harder, robbing energy from you in the process. It also makes it harder to breathe deeply and fully, which further reduces energy levels.
The pressure placed on the vertebrae due to poor posture can lead to pinched nerves, stiffness, decreased flexibility and mobility, and even reduced sensation in the extremities.
Good posture makes your muscles more limber; relaxes tension in your neck, shoulders, and back (which can reduce your stress level); and can even boost your mood and psyche. Studies indicate that people with good posture are on average more confident and energetic, and have better memory skills.

, Nowadays, whether we’re working, relaxing, or even walking around, we tend to be hunched over a glowing screen. Not surprisingly, this helps to instill poor posture habits. With active awareness and some simple changes, you can instill good habits instead.Focus on holding your cell phone at eye level when using it, instead of slouching over to look at it. This simple adjustment can do wonders for your posture.
Take note of your posture any time you stand in front of a mirror or pass a reflective window. Remaining vigilant will help you retrain your body.
When you have the option of standing or sitting, choose to stand. The human body is built for standing up, and standing is better for muscle development and overall health. Also, many bad posture habits are ingrained while sitting.
When you do sit, focus on keeping your feet flat on the floor and your back flat against an upright, sturdy chair. Place your computer or other screen at eye level, and desk high enough that your elbows can rest on it while extended straight ahead., Achieving good posture isn’t just about good habits and proper positioning; you also need to strengthen the muscles that keep you in alignment. Stronger shoulder muscles, for instance, can make it easier to fend off your tendency to slouch.Bend your arms and hold them in front of you, at shoulder level and parallel to the floor.
Squeeze your shoulder blades together. Don’t bring them together by pulling your outstretched arms apart. Instead, let your shoulder retraction pull your arms further apart. Focus on using the muscles in your upper back.
Hold each squeeze for one or two seconds, then release and repeat for two minutes. Do this exercise at least once, or up to several times per day.

, It may sound odd at first, but one of the best ways to strengthen your neck muscles is to do exercises that focus on moving your chin. Once you try them, though, you’ll quickly notice how they stretch and utilize your neck muscles.For a sitting chin tuck, sit upright in a chair with your head in a neutral (proper upright seating) position. Tuck your chin inward, as if trying to retract it, without dropping it downward. Use a hand as a guide (but only push gently) if necessary. You should feel your neck muscles tense and release along with the maneuver. Hold for one or two seconds, release, and repeat for two minutes.
To do a reclined chin tuck, lie flat on the floor on your back. Place your arms at your sides and bend your knees so that your feet are flat on the floor. Tuck your chin in (straight down toward the floor, not towards your chest) while keeping the back of your head on the floor. Hold, release, and repeat.
For a traditional chin drop, sit upright in a chair with your feet flat on the floor and your hands resting on your thighs. Rotate your head downward so that your chin touches your chest (or comes as close as you can do comfortably). Try to relax your neck muscles as they stretch out. Make sure not to “round” your shoulders forward as you tuck your chin downward. Hold the position for thirty seconds, then release and repeat several more times.
You can add greater stretching to a chin drop by placing one hand behind your head and gently pressing downward as you tuck your chin. Don’t press too hard, and stop if you feel unusual pain (that is, more than the typical “burn” from stretching your neck muscles).

, Developing more muscle tone in the pectorals not only makes a guy look better with his shirt off, it also helps men and women retain proper posture by keeping the shoulders from slouching forward.Stand facing a corner. Lift your arms to shoulder-height (parallel with the floor) with your arms bent at the elbow, so that one of your elbows and forearms rests on each of the two intersecting walls. Adjust your distance from the wall if necessary so that you are neither leaning in nor away from the wall in this starting position.
While keeping your forearms and elbows against the walls, begin to lean forward until you feel a pulling sensation in your pecs. Hold this position for thirty seconds, return to the starting position, and repeat several times per session and one or more times per day.

Measure your waistline.,
Check your blood pressure to see if it’s high.,
Check your good and bad cholesterol levels.,
See if your blood sugar is consistently high or low.,
Check your triglyceride levels.",How to Tell if You Have Metabolic Syndrome1," If you have a large waistline, it can be a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. While a large waistline may often depend upon your height, there are some measurements which will usually tell you if you are at risk for metabolic syndrome.For men, a waistline over 40 inches (100 cm) can be a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. A waistline over 35 inches (88.9 cm) is a risk for women.
Waist circumference does have a number of problems a predictor of metabolic syndrome, including ethnic differences and height. While it can be a risk factor, it should not be the only one to pay attention to for metabolic syndrome.;
, High blood pressure is another risk factor for metabolic syndrome. If you’re blood pressure is consistently at a high level, you may be at risk.Systolic blood over 130 mm Hg or more puts you at risk for metabolic syndrome. This is the top number if you are taking your own blood pressure or using a blood pressure machine.
Diastolic blood pressure over 85 mm HG or more is also a risk for metabolic syndrome. This is the bottom number when you are taking your blood pressure.

, Cholesterol levels are important indicators of potentially health difficulties, including metabolic syndrome. Too much bad cholesterol, as well as not enough good cholesterol, can both be bad for your health.The good cholesterol in your blood is high-density lipoprotein or HDL cholesterol. If this level is low, which generally means under 40 mg/Dl, then it can be a potential risk factor.
Bad cholesterol, or low-density lipoprotein (LDL), can cause plaque build-up in your blood and heart. LDL levels from 160-190 mg/Dl are usually a sign of high cholesterol levels., If your blood sugar is often too high or too low, this can be a sign of metabolic syndrome. It can also be a sign of pre-diabetes or even diabetes itself.High blood sugar is called hyperglycemia. If it’s over 240, then your blood sugar is very high. An ideal range is usually 150 at the most after meals.
Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. Blood sugar levels under 70 are too low and can be a problem.

, Triglycerides are fats that are in your blood left over after you’ve converted calories into energy. Testing is usually included in standard cholesterol testing, also called a lipid panel.Triglyceride levels can vary throughout the day. However, less than 150 mg/Dl is the normal level for triglycerides.
If your triglyceride is over 150 and up to 500, then you may have an issue with your triglyceride level. This can lead to serious health problems, including heart disease and stroke.

Shape the ear plugs and put one in each ear., Shower before getting inside the floatation pod or room. You need to shower in order to remove body oils and odors. After you shower, remember to dry your face so that you will be less tempted to touch your face or eyes with salty hands during the session., You will have control over a few aspects of the floatation experience such as music, whether the floatation ceiling is closed or open, and the level of darkness. Some rooms will play relaxation music whereas others will be quiet. If you have the choice of music, decide whether you want it on or off. If there is a choice of lighting, experiment to see what level of darkness you prefer. Some people prefer low lighting and others like it pitch black., Once you get inside the pool, you will be lying on your back in shallow salt water.

Take fish oil daily.,
Consider herbal supplements, with caution.,
Take L-Tryptophan for sleep and anxiety.,
Treat your depression with SAM-e.",How to Treat Depression With Supplements2," Before trying herbs and amino acids you should investigate a possible vitamin or mineral deficiency. This is because a poor diet (malnutrition) can lower mood by depriving the brain of important nutrients needed to function properly.B Vitamins. These include Vitamin B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B12 as well as folic acid and other associated names for them. B Vitamins are often sold separately or in a B-Complex, which combine the vitamins to support the nervous system and relieve stress, helping mild depression.

Vitamin C. Vitamin C is a health all-rounder and is most commonly referred to as reducing the severity of colds and the flu. Vitamin C is very cheap in its chewable form and is an essential addition to the formation of a depression diet.

Vitamin D. Many people get all the Vitamin D they need from sunlight, which helps the body to synthesize this vitamin. However for people with limited sun exposure particularly during the winter months, depressed mood can take its toll. Supplementing with Vitamin D3 has been proven to elevate mood where a deficiency exists and even for those who already get adequate levels from the sun. As well as being found in foods in small amounts, Vitamin D3 can be readily bought in differing strengths such as 4000IU.

Multivitamins. Take a multivitamin for a general overlay of important nutrients you may not be getting from your diet.

, The omega-3 in fish oil helps regulate not only healthy hearts but also healthy brains. Look for fish oil brands with a higher ratio of DHA (mental health) to EPA (heart health) - fatty acids found in fish oil. For example, 1g capsules of fish oil with 300mg DHA and 200mg EPA.

, Some such as St John's wort have been clinically proven to treat depression. However, St. John's wort can interact with popular prescription antidepressants such as Zoloft and Celexa. . Some supplements can be bought over the counter in pharmacies and health food stores, but your country's physician may also prescribe it. Other herbs like kava root may be an effective option, but take care to ask a shop assistant what their suggestion is for depression. Herbs can be a win-or-miss affair when treating depression, as unlike vitamins, minerals and fatty acids (omega-3s) no deficiencies exist in the human diet.

, Tryptophan is an important amino acid found naturally in the body and in a variety of food sources, include poultry, nuts and seeds. Tryptophan helps induce sleep and is also made into niacin (Vitamin B3) and serotonin inside the body. These products can reduce anxiety and elevate mood. If you don't want to take the tablet or capsule form of tryptophan, a great source of it is from lecithin granules found at a health food store. Sprinkle some in your smoothie or over your breakfast cereal for a daily supplement of this amino acid.

, Many studies have looked at SAM-e (pronounced ""Sammy""), and the results have showed it is quick in elevating mood. This important biological agent increases serotonin levels and performs other actions similar to conventional anti-depressants. However it comes at a high price (about $50-70 USD for 60 capsules). Try SAM-e for depression if you can afford it. It can be found in most health food stores.

Postpone your brain's aging.",How to Strengthen Your Mind1," If something you’re already doing consistently challenges you and keeps you engaged, it is strengthening your brain. In fact, your brain requires challenging stimulation to continue becoming more powerful. Hobbies that continually force you to do new things, like learning to play a new song, are ideal for working out your brain.An important distinction to consider: playing a difficult song that you’ve already memorized is much different than learning a new song. Learning the new song will engage your brain more aggressively, and provide you with a better mental workout.;
, Unfamiliar tasks force your brain to create new neural pathways that strengthen your ability to solve problems, execute tasks, and even process and recall information. One way to ensure your brain is faced with new mental tasks is to start learning a new skill. Ensure whatever skill you’re looking to pick up will be able to continually challenge you. Further, make sure you’re interested enough to stick with it.Perhaps the best example is learning a new language. Learning a new language is particularly challenging and mentally engaging.

, Repeating something over and over to yourself is one of the surest ways to get it to stick in your memory. The better you become at committing information to memory, the more capable your memory becomes generally. Your memory is even more likely to be engaged if you paraphrase the information you want to memorize slightly differently as you’re repeating it. For example, when you meet someone new, repeat their name back to them out loud. Then repeat it several times over in your head.When someone or some new fact pops back into your mind, repeat it to yourself again several times over. Each time, vary the thought slightly. For instance, “Her name is Jenny” and “That gal’s name is Jenny.”

, Even your grocery list can become a quick brain work out. Our brain enjoys organizing and building associations, and asking it to do so provides the mental equivalent of dropping and doing twenty. For instance, group the items on any list into like categories. For instance, reorganize your grocery list so all the produce items are together, and all the canned goods in a different category. This will specifically engage your short-term memory.This is also called “chunking.” Phone numbers are an example of how chunking can enhance your memory. Think of how hard it would be to remember ten straight digits, as opposed a few at a time, separated by dashes.

, Mnemonics are clues you can assign to certain information to help you remember something. One of the most classic examples is visual imaging. You want to remember who Michael Jordan is? Think a man wearing red shorts, floating through the air, ball cocked pack like a hatchet, legs spread to nearly a right angle.Imagining this image while thinking about the name Michael Jordan, for instance, makes it more likely that you remember the name.
Note colors and account for some three-dimensional depth. Make the image as vivid as you can. For instance, conjure another player, perhaps wearing a yellow jersey with a purple 8 on it, flopping and fading into the darkness.
Acronyms, such as “HOMES” to help remembers the names of each of North America’s Great Lakes, and rhymes are other mnemonics that can help you remember specific things, and increase your memory’s capacity overall.

, There are plenty of claims made by apps and online companies about strengthening your brain. Many will claim to improve your memory, attention span, ability to solve problems, and even boost your IQ. Research on the efficacy of these apps indicates that they don’t do any of these things. While you may get better at the particular sort of task the app asks you to perform, your intelligence, memory, and cognitive abilities are unlikely to be affected., Keep your mind active to help prevent the mental fogginess that many people experience as they age. You can even postpone the symptoms of diseases such as Alzheimer's by keeping your brain engaged. The steps in this section, as well as many in the following sections are important to keep your brain healthy as you age.If you're beginning to endure symptoms of mental decline, don't worry. Following the steps throughout this article - including eating healthy and exercising - can help your mind get back on track!
If you've been diagnosed with some form of dementia, you've likely noticed your mind begin to change substantially. Fortunately, changing your behavior in the ways mentioned here can slow these changes. Talk to your doctor about your medication options as well. Consider taking part in a clinical trial to get access to the newest drugs."

Avoid caffeine.,
Do some exercise.,
Listen to calming music.,
Have a shower or a bath.,
Reach out to family and friends.,
Think positively.",How to Relax Before An Exciting Event1," Do not ingest any caffeine after 12:00 pm the day before your event.Caffeine increases your stress response and your perception of stress. If you are already feeling stressed about your event, drinking caffeine will make your body have a stronger response to stress.You may feel more relaxed if you do not drink or eat any caffeine (e.g. chocolate, some teas, sodas, coffee).;
, Light exercise such as walking, yoga, or gardening can help you feel more relaxed.Exercise will increase the feel-good endorphins in your brain, reduce stress, and help you sleep better.Make sure you do some form of exercise that you actually enjoy. Exercise should not feel like a burden but should help you unwind before your event.

, Music can help you to calm down and relax before an event.Avoid music with a fast tempo or hard rock music. Music will help distract you from the event and decrease stress hormones. Turn your music up loudly so that you get lost in it.If you are not into music, try another creative hobby to distract your mind such as writing, sketching, or doodling.

, A warm bath or shower will help you to relax and can help you get a good night's sleep before your event.Add chamomile, lavender, or mandarin, or Frankincense oil to your bath for added benefits.As you soak in the bath, try not to think about your event. Close your eyes and breath deeply.


Soak in the bath for 15-20 minutes for the best results.

, A good support system can help you manage your excitement.Your family and friends know you well and want the best for you. If you do not want to talk about the event, they can help you take your mind off of it. If you feel nervous or stressed about the event, let them know how you feel. They will most likely offer you some encouraging words.

, Believe that the best possible outcome for the event will happen. If you have a negative thought about the event, counter that thought with something positive and affirming instead.Find a way to put a positive spin on the situation. Instead of saying, ""It's too difficult,"" say, ""I can make this work.""


Surround yourself with positive people before your event as well. Negative people can make you feel more stressed and cause you to doubt yourself.

Gather three balloons.,
Choose a filling.,
Blow up the balloon slightly (optional).,
Stick a funnel into the neck.,
Slowly fill the balloon.,
Pinch out excess air and tie closed.,
Snip off the excess rubber.,
Wrap around two more balloons.",How to Make a Stress Ball1," These should all be the same size and shape, and all uninflated. Don't use water balloons, which are too thin and weak for this purpose.;
, For a typical palm-sized stress ball, you'll need approximately ⅔ to 1 cup (160–240 mL) of filling. Any of these will do:


For a firm stress ball, use flour, baking soda, or cornstarch (a white powder called cornflour in the Commonwealth).
For a looser stress ball, use dry rice lentils, small beans, or split peas, or fine play sand from a hardware store.
Mix a small amount of dried rice into flour for something in between. This is also more durable than flour alone.

, This isn't always necessary, but can be useful if the balloon isn't elastic enough to fit the filling. Blow it up to about 3–5 inches (7.5–12.5 cm) across, then pinch the neck shut without tying it.


This is easiest to do with a clip or assistant to hold it closed.
This can make the filling process messier if the air escapes while you're filling it.

, If you do not have a funnel, spoon the filling into a plastic bottle instead, and fit the balloon over the neck. A plastic cup pinched to form a spout will work too, but tends to make a mess.

, For a typical palm-sized ball, you'll want to fill the balloon approximately 2–3 inches (5–7.5 cm) deep. Pour slowly to avoid clogging the neck of the balloon.


If it clogs, use a pencil or spoon handle to clear the opening.

, Remove the balloon from the funnel and let out as much air as you can. Tie the neck of the balloon closed tightly.


To release the air, pinch near the neck and separate your finger and thumb slightly. Too wide an opening can blow flour everywhere.

, Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut off the dangling end of the balloon. Don't try to cut too close to the knot, or it could come undone.

, Wrap the second balloon around your stress ball for additional strength. Tie closed, snip off the excess rubber, then repeat with a third balloon to finish the job.

Sit in a quiet space.,
Try progressive muscle relaxation.,
Practice a five minute meditation exercise.,
Do deep breathing exercises.,
Listen to calming music.",How to Relax and Clear Your Mind1," Find a quiet room and draw the curtains so there is no light to distract you.

Try to find a spot with no phones, computers, or co-workers or friends who can interrupt you.;
, This technique can help you relax the major muscle groups in your body.Sit on a yoga mat or lie down.
Start with your facial muscles. Frown hard for 5-10 seconds and then relax your facial muscles.
Scrunch up your face or knit your eyebrows for 5-10 seconds and then relax your muscles.
You should feel a noticeable difference between the tense and relaxed muscles.

Breathe deeply.,
Listen to soothing sounds.,
Keep a journal.,
Unplug for a period of time each day.,
Enjoy nature.",How to Make Yourself Relax1," One great way to relax is to meditate. You don't need to learn complicated techniques or yoga. A few minutes of simple meditation every day can help release tension and anxiety.The key to effective meditation is to find a quiet spot away from distractions. Focus your mind and energy without letting your mind wander.Try progressive muscle relaxation. Start by wearing loose clothes and being barefoot. Take a few slow, deep breaths to start relaxation. When you feel relaxed, focus on your right foot. Think about how it feels. Then, slowly tense the muscles in your foot and hold for 10 seconds. As you relax your foot, feel the tension releasing as your foot feels limp and loose. Breathe deep as you focus on the way your foot feels. Then, do the same thing for your left foot. Continue up your body, going back and forth between right and left side, with each muscle group.

This helps you reduce overwhelming stress by only focusing on the now.;
, Deep breathing is one of the most effective relaxation techniques. It is used as the basis for many other relaxation and meditation techniques. Breathing is easy to learn and can be done anywhere at anytime.


Start by sitting straight in a chair in a quiet room. Close your eyes. Clear your mind of outside thoughts. Focus only on your surroundings. Think about how your feet feel on the floor, the posture of your back, the clothes against your skin.
Turn your attention to your breathing. Inhale and exhale at a tempo that feels good and comfortable for you. Don't breathe too deeply. Keep the breaths calming and natural. Try to make the exhale last longer than the inhale.Make sure you are breathing through your belly. Place your hand on your stomach and feel each breath. Breathe in through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Your stomach should move while your chest does not., Sounds can have a powerful relaxation effect. Try closing your eyes and lying down while listening to something that relaxes you. If you are at work or driving, turn on music and focus on it while trying to push out other thoughts.


Listen to uplifting music. Put in your favorite CD, make a playlist of fun songs, or listen to a genre that makes you happy. Sing along to the songs for added relaxation.Put on nature CDs of crashing waves or rain. If you prefer music, try piano or violin instrumental music, or New Age sounds like Enya.
Buy a fountain and keep it by your desk at work. When you need to relax, take a moment to close your eyes and listen to the soothing water., Spend a few minutes every day writing about your day. You can journal about everything and anything. Write pages if you feel like it. Just jot down two lines. Make the activity about clearing your stress and allowing yourself to relax.


Write out your frustrations about the day. What bothered you? Can you fix it? If not, then just get it out so you can try to move on.Use the journal to boost your self esteem. Write reminders to yourself about your positive attributes. Assure yourself it is okay to have bad days. Write things like, ""You are awesome"" or ""I love myself.""
Don't add journaling into your relaxation practice if it adds even more stress., Spend time each day where you are not influenced by technology. Distractions and responsibilities linked to e-mail, social media, and the internet can keep you stressed without you realizing it. Set aside time every day to free yourself from those distractions.Put your cell phone in another room, log off your laptop, and turn off the television. Go for a walk. Sit in the park and watch the squirrels. Take a bath. Read. Cook dinner. It doesn't matter what you do; just focus on your task and enjoy the moment without technological distractions.
Try going for 30 minutes on weekdays without technology. Try an hour a day on the weekends.

, Nature has great restorative properties. Research has even shown how being in nature can improve mental health. Sunshine contains Vitamin D, which helps boost moods. Fresh air also provides mental and physical benefits.Take a walk. Garden. Play an outdoor sport. Go to a state park and go hiking. If you have the time, go camping for the weekend.
You don't have to exercise to enjoy the restorative qualities of nature. Sit in the park and feed the pigeons. Eat dinner on your patio. Talk on the phone outside."

Hang out with your friends.,
Allow yourself to laugh.,
Read classic literature.",How to Strengthen Your Mind2," That’s right. You can strengthen your mind simply by hanging out with other humans and enjoying each other’s company. In fact, our brain’s health requires that we have a strong social support system. Believe it or not: the more social your life, the slower your memory will decline with age.There are plenty of ways to up your social interaction. Start volunteering with an organization the works on issues you care about, or simply call up an old friend you haven’t spoken to in a while and catch up.

, If you realize you’ve been taking life a bit too seriously, think about something you’ve done recently that you could have handled more calmly. Here’s the kicker: laugh at yourself for being so darn high-strung sometimes! Forcing yourself to confront ways in which you sometimes behave humorously without realizing it will also help you start to change those behaviors. Further, laughing immediately reduces stress, thus contributing to a healthy, happier brain.Perhaps the best way to find something to laugh about is to hang around fun people. The more someone laughs in your company, the more likely you’ll catch the giggles yourself. Children, in particular, are a consistently reliable source of laugh-inducing statements and behaviors.
Place reminders to lighten up where you’ll see them often. Hang a doll from your rear view mirror, put a meme on your computer’s background, or put some laugh-inducing photos of you and your friends on your desk. Seeing these throughout the day will help keep your mind at ease.

, Expose your mind to emotional and social extremes from the safety of a book. Authors like Jane Austen and David Foster Wallace are capable of spinning webs of intrigue that can stimulate and expand your mind. Further, they create realistic social environments than you can learn from and experience from the comfort of an armchair. All of this helps ultimately helps improve your social skills, and can even generate connections between the emotional and social parts of your brain."

Exercise daily.,
Get plenty of sleep.,
Eat with mental health in mind.,
Drink brain emboldening beverages.,
Opt for complex carbs.",How to Strengthen Your Mind3," Get your heart rate up for at least a few minutes every day. The healthy benefits of exercise cannot be understated. Exercise boosts neuroplasticity and provides an immediate reduction in stress hormones. Further, memory-sapping health maladies, such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, are less likely to develop in active individuals.Favor aerobic exercises that get your blood pumping, like swimming or jogging
Games like basketball, which require hand-eye coordination and engage your motor skills, are great, as they give your brain a work out along with your body.
If you can, exercise first thing in the morning. Not only will this help you wake your brain up, it will jumpstart learning for the rest of the day.
Even a walk around the block or a couple dozen jumping jacks can give your mind a body a quick jolt of focus and energy., You may be getting “enough” sleep, but in order to maximize your brain’s potential, you probably need more. Almost all adults require 7.5 to 9 hours of sleep in order to enjoy full mental strength during the day. Your memory, ability to learn new things, and even creativity can’t reach their full potential if your brain and body aren’t fully rested.Quality of sleep matters immensely as well. To help fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night, get on a regular sleeping schedule. Try to get to bed and get up around the same time everyday. Keep this schedule on the weekends too!
Help yourself wind down by avoiding screens of any type for the hour before you go to bed. Try reading instead!

, Certain dietary habits can help keep your brain functioning at full speed, and even diminish the risk of developing dementia. In particular, make sure omega-3 is consistently present in your diet. These fatty acids are most commonly found in cold water fish like salmon and tuna. They are also in flaxseeds, walnuts, spinach, and soybeans.Make fruits and veggies are greater portion of your overall diet. This will help cut back on other foods that are more likely to cause mental and physical sluggishness.

, Green tea contains loads of antioxidants that help rid your body of brain cell-damaging free radicals. Red wine, on the other hand, can help increase blood flow to the brain and can reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s. Alternatively, grape and cranberry juice offer these same benefits.Keep alcohol consumption around 1 glass per day. While alcohol in moderation may actually contribute to improved mental capacity, too much alcohol kills brain cells.

, All carbs provide energy that your brain can use. Simple carbs, such as those in foods made with sugar or refined grain will give your body a short energy boost and a dramatic crash. Instead, go for foods that include complex carbs. These include whole wheat bread, brown rice, oatmeal, cereal with lots of fiber, lentils, and beans.

Address recurring sources of stress.,
Meditate daily.,
See a mental health professional.",How to Strengthen Your Mind4," If you find yourself agitated, nervous, or frantic with regularity, you need to figure out how to reduce the amount of stress your body and mind endures. Chronic stress can damage and even destroy brain cells, harming your ability to form new memories or retrieve old ones. One of the most immediate ways to reduce stress is taking brief breaks from your daily grind. Relatedly, try to live a life that balances professional obligations and other responsibilities with fun and relaxing pursuits.If you find yourself constantly worrying about achieving expectations, you should re-evalauate the expectations you’re setting for yourself. Trying to achieve things that are unrealistic will actually diminish your productivity overall.

Start practicing by closing your eyes somewhere quiet, holding still, and counting. Try to push away thoughts as they arise and focus solely on counting.

, If you’ve been dealing with any sort of mental discomfort for some time, consider meeting with someone who can talk to you about your options. This is especially important for constant stress or depression. Therapists can talk to you about what you’re experiencing and help you plan a path to address the way you’re feeling and thinking. Further, it’s important to express your feelings, and many people find that this is easy to do with a trained mental health professional.Depression makes concentrating and remembering things harder. Treating depression can return your memory to its full capabilities.

Sew the foam around the rubber ball.,
Sew a sock or piece of thick fabric around the memory foam.",How to Make a Stress Ball2," You can find the rubber ball from children's toy stores, and memory foam at some fabric stores or specialized online stores. You'll want a piece of memory foam roughly 3.5 x 5 inches (9 x 12.5 cm) in size, and anywhere from 1 to 3 inches (2.5–7.5 cm) thick.

Reading from light-emitting electronic readers also has been shown to interfere with sleep quality, and lowers the secretion of melatonin, a sleep-inducing hormone., Not getting enough sleep means lower cognitive abilities, being more moody, irritable and cranky, and lower grades in school.

, Taking a hot bath is a great way to relax the body, relieving tension and soreness in your muscles. Think about adding some of your favorite scents, bath salts or decorating the room with candles or other relaxing items. Once you've prepared your bath all that's left to do is soak and enjoy.

, You can go out to a spa and get a massage which can be an excellent way to relax. However, if you want to stay home and enjoy a day to yourself you can give yourself a massage, working out tension in your muscles and bringing about a sense of relaxation.Massage your scalp by gently rubbing the sides of your head near the temples.
Massage your face by using your fingertips, rubbing your jawline, hairline, cheekbones, and earlobes.
Massage your arm by laying it flat on your leg and using your opposite palm to rub down your forearm towards your wrist.
Massage your thighs using your palm or elbows, applying gentle pressure as you move down towards your knee.

Pick a type of meditation that appeals to you.,
Get comfortable.,
Try mindfulness meditation.,
Consider visualization techniques.,
Slowly return to normal activity.",How to Have a Relaxing Day3," The term meditation describes the general practice of working with your mental life to reduce stress there. Although the term itself is general there are specific forms of meditation that you can engage in. Examine the following overview to get you started in finding a form of meditation that feels right for you:You can create a safe and wonderful space in your mind and explore it, imagining it with all your senses.
Repeating a phrase or word can help keep your focus on the phrase instead of bothersome or distracting thoughts.
Try simply watching your thoughts and feelings, allowing them to pass by without judgment or attachment.

, The first step in meditating will be to manage your environment, making it calm and distraction free. The focus during meditation will be on your inner mental life and outside distractions can cause you to lose that focus. Make your space stress free and get your body relaxed and comfortable before you start to meditate.You might find that laying down or comfortably sitting are good postures for meditation.
Make sure your clothes are lose fitting and comfortable.
Turn your phone off before getting started.

, Mindfulness meditation allows the stream of noise that your mind produces to pass by you, allowing you to relax and simply observe. You will need to quiet your mind and focus, relaxing into the meditation and allowing any distracting thoughts or stress to pass you by without attachment to them.Sit down and close your eyes.
Take note of your mental activity. Chances are you will be talking or thinking to yourself.
Calmly watch your inner thoughts, images, or feelings that your mind produces.
Your goal is to simply observe these thoughts without attaching or engaging with them.
If you find yourself engaging with your thoughts, gently return your focus and resume passively watching them.
You will find that over time you mental chatter will fade and grow quiet, affording you a calm and relaxed mind.

, Your imagination has a great amount of power over how you feel mentally. The human mind doesn't make distinctions between your imagined experiences and reality. Take advantage of this fact and create a wonderful and relaxing experience using your imagination.Get comfortable and close your eyes.
Think of a place that you find calming and safe, somewhere that you love being.
Try to see this space in great detail. Think of what the colors look like here or what items or people appear as. Try to see this calming space as clearly as you can.
Imagine the sounds of this space. What noises can you hear? Take your time and really imagine that you can hear the sounds of your visualized space.
Ask yourself what smells are in your calm and relaxing space. Inhale and imagine the scents as your breathe them in.
Pay attention to how your space feels. Ask yourself what the temperature is, what some items feel like to touch, or what a breeze might feel like.
Take your time and enjoy the space you have created, exploring and relaxing there for as long as you like.

, After you have finished meditating you will want to slowly refocus your attention on the “outside” world again. Notice any feelings of inner calm or peace as you engage once again with the world, knowing that you can find these relaxed feelings again when you start to feel stress in the future.

Stay away from caffeine, alcohol, drugs and smoking.,
Lower your stress levels.,
Take early afternoon naps.,
Practice relaxation strategies.",How to Get Enough Rest (in High School)2," In addition to being actively harmful to your health in other ways, these substances all interfere with your ability to get quality sleep. Drinking even one alcoholic beverage before bedtime, for example, results in disrupted sleep.People may associate alcohol with feelings of relaxation, but the scientific evidence doesn't back this up.
Beware of caffeine hidden in some products. In addition to coffee, tea, and sodas, caffeine is found in chocolate, energy drinks, and certain cold medications. Read the labels before consuming any of these things in the late afternoon or evening.
Avoid using any products, including alcohol or herbal supplements, to help you sleep.

, Studies show that there is a high correlation between high stress levels and insufficient sleep. Not getting enough sleep results in higher stress levels, but having too much stress also results in getting less sleep. Take active steps to lower the stress in your life in order to get enough rest in high school. According to researchers, adolescent rates of stress are similar to those of adults.Teens who spend less time online report overall lower levels of stress.
Physical activity is one of the best ways to lower stress. Walking, jogging, swimming, doing yoga, or playing basketball with friends are all good ways to move your body, reduce your stress, and get a better night's sleep.
If you find yourself getting stressed out by a situation you don't know how to deal with, talk to someone about it. Even if the other person can't solve your problem, sharing it with her often helps lower your stress about it., If you really need to catch up on sleep, take short naps in the early afternoon. Good daytime naps shouldn't be more than 20-30 minutes in length.Taking naps in the later afternoon or evening may interfere with your sleep schedule, and are best avoided.
Make sure your napping place is quiet, restful and reasonably dark.
There are three types of napping that can be used to help you get enough rest. They are planned naps, when you schedule a nap on a day you expect you'll be sleepy; emergency naps, for when you are just too sleepy to function well; and habitual naps, when you set aside time in your daily schedule for a nap.

, Learning relaxation strategies, such as meditation, yoga or a relaxing hobby, can help lower your stress levels, and have a positive effect on your sleep. Teens will appreciate relaxation techniques that they can use on their own, without guidance from a parent or adult.Progressive muscle relaxation is a good technique to fall asleep by. This is a step-by-step self-guided relaxation of each individual part of the body, starting at the toes and working up to the tip of the scalp. One by one, each muscle group is identified by awareness, tensed for 5-10 seconds, and then relaxed.
Guided auditory meditations may also be useful for teens. Explore different techniques until you find the one that's relaxing for you.

Learn the consequences of not getting enough rest.,
Understand the connection between sleep and mood disorders.,
See a professional.",How to Get Enough Rest (in High School)3," Sleep deprivation affects everything from driving to decision-making and response time. When someone is sleep deprived, she is as functionally impaired as someone with a blood alcohol content of .08%, which is legally intoxicated in most states.Consequences of not getting enough rest are far more than feeling sleepy. Insufficient sleep leads to difficulties with concentration, being unmotivated to take care of responsibilities.
Lack of sleep leads to more acne and pimples.
You may become more aggressive or irritable, getting into trouble with your peers and friends.
Many teens overeat when they don't get enough rest, or eat too many unhealthy foods when they're tired. Not getting enough sleep can contribute to obesity and other health problems.

, Sleeplessness is connected to clinical depression, suicidal ideation, and other mood disorders.Research shows that there is a strong association between negative mood and sleep problems in children ages 11-17.


Among teenagers who report being unhappy, 73% report insufficient sleep at night.Many signs of sleeplessness are identical to signs of depression, including sleepiness during the day, poor concentration, forgetfulness, loss of energy, listlessness, and changes in weight and appetite.

, Insomnia is both a symptom and a cause of depression in teens. If you have tried to get more rest on your own and you're still unable to sleep, consult a medical provider for help. Symptoms of depression often are hidden by typical teenage behavior or sleep disturbances. Understanding the reason for your sleeplessness may provide better ways to address it.Anxiety and depression tend to affect more teenage girls than boys.
Behaviors associated with depression may be more likely to be disregarded in girls. For teenagers, some form of cognitive behavioral treatment may be indicated.

Say hello: (How does that whole thing feel in your body now?),
Begin to describe something:


Now something is here.,
Pick a problem.,
Let the felt sense form:


Ask ""What does this whole thing feel like?"".,
Find the handle:


Find a word, phrase, image, sound or gesture that feels like it matches, comes from, or will act as a 'handle' on the felt sense, the whole feel of it.,
Resonating the handle.,
Ask and receive:


Now we are going to ask the felt sense some questions.,
Sense for a stopping place.,
Receive and experience what has changed:


Take some time to sense any changes that have happened in your body, especially anything which feels more open or released.,
Let it know you're willing to come back:


You might want to say to It ""I'm willing to come back if you need me."",
Thank.,
Bring awareness out.",How to Focus and Get a Felt Sense,"


Find a comfortable position... Relax and close your eyes... Take a few deep breaths... and when you're ready just ask, ""How am I inside right now?"" Don't answer. Give an answer time to form in your body... Turn your attention like a searchlight into your inside feeling place and just greet whatever you find there. Practice taking a friendly attitude toward whatever is there. Just listen to your organism.;
, You can sense it somewhere. Take some time now to notice just where it is in your body. Notice if it would feel right to begin to describe it, as simply as you might tell another person what you are aware of. You can use words, images, gestures, metaphors, whatever fits, captures, expresses somehow the quality of this whole thing. And when you've described it a bit, take some time to notice how your body responds to that. It's like you're checking the description with the body feeling, saying ""Does this fit you well?""

,


Feel yourself magnetically pulled toward the one thing in your stack that most needs your attention right now. If you have any trouble letting it choose you, ask, ""What is worst?"" (or ""What's best?"" ?-- good feelings can be worked with too!). ""What most needs some work right now? ""What won't let go of me?"" Pick one thing.

, ""What is the whole feel of it?"" Don't answer with what you already know about it. Listen to your body. Sense the issue freshly. Give your body 30 seconds to a minute for the feel of ""all of that"" to form.

, Keep your attention on the area in your body where you feel it, and just let a word, phrase, image, sound or gesture appear that feels like a good fit.

,


Say the word, phrase, image, sound or gesture back to yourself. Check it against your body. See if there is a sense of ""rightness,"" an inner ""yes, that's it"". If there isn't, gently let go of that handle and let one that fits better appear.

, Some it will answer, some it won't. Receive whatever answers it gives. Ask the questions with an expectantly friendly attitude and be receptive to whatever it sends you.
Ask ""What's the crux of this feeling?"" ""What's the main thing about it?"" Don't answer with your head; let the body feeling answer. Now, breathe that answer out.
And ask, ""What's wrong?"" Imagine the felt sense as a shy child sitting on a stoop. It needs caring encouragement to speak. Go over to it, sit down, and gently ask, ""What's wrong?"" Wait. Now, breathe that answer out.
And ask, ""What's the worst of this feeling?"" ""What makes it so bad?"" Wait... Now, breathe that answer out of your system.
And ask, ""What does this feeling need?"" Wait... Now, breathe that answer out.
And now ask, ""What is a good small step in the right direction for this thing?"" ""What is a step in the direction of fresh air?"" Wait. Now, breathe that answer out.
Ask, ""What needs to happen?"" ""What actions need to be taken?"" Wait. Now, breathe that answer out.
And now ask, ""What would my body feel like if this thing were all better, all resolved?"" Move your body into the position or posture it would be in if this were all cleared up. This is called looking the answer up in the back of the book. Now, from this position, ask, ""What's between me and here?"" ""What's in the way of it being all OK?"" Wait. Now, breathe that answer out.
Finally, ask your felt sense space to send you the exactly right question you need at this moment. Now ask the felt sense that question. Don't answer with your head. Just hang out with the felt sense, keep it company, let it respond. Wait. Now, breathe that answer out.

,


Take some time to sense inside if it is OK to end in a few minutes or if there something more that needs to be known first. If something more comes then take some time to acknowledge that.

, This is sometimes called a 'shift'.

,

,


And you might want to thank what has come, and appreciate your body's process.

Take some time to bring your awareness slowly outward again, feeling your hands and feet, being aware of the room and letting your eyes come naturally open.

Give it time.",How to Be Quiet," People who are naturally loud do not possess this important skill. So, the next time you’re in a situation where you’re just dying to say something, pause, take a minute, and ask yourself if what you have to say will really help the situation. Will you be giving people information that they need, making people laugh, or offering words of comfort, or will you be saying something just to be heard? If you don’t think anyone will actually benefit from what you have to say, then keep it to yourself.


One rule to follow when you’re starting off is to say one of every two things you’re thinking. As you work on being more quiet, then you can say one of every three things, or one of every four things.;
, Don’t ever interrupt a person while he or she is talking unless you think what you have to say is crucial to the conversation (let’s face it – when is that ever the case?). Not only is it rude to interrupt people, but it will disrupt the flow of the conversation and will make you look like a loudmouth. If you really have a comment to make or a question to ask, then make a note of it and wait until the other person is done talking to see if what you have to say is still relevant.


You’d be surprised by how many of your questions will get answered anyway if you just let people talk.

, If you’re working on being more quiet, then chances are that you tend to talk on and on about yourself or the things that really interest you instead of letting other people share their ideas. So, the next time you’re having a conversation and it’s your turn to speak, ask people questions to get more information about the topic you’re discussing, or to learn more about them, from what their hobbies are to what they like to do for fun.


You don’t have to make it sound like an interrogation or ask questions that make people uncomfortable. Keep things light, friendly, and polite.

, If you’ve thought of the most amazing comment to make ever, give it ten seconds. Count down from ten to see if the idea suddenly sounds less appealing, or to give other people time to chime in and to keep you from saying what you wanted to say. This is also a great technique if you’re feeling angry or upset and want to air your grievances. Giving yourself a little bit of time to calm down can keep you from saying something you’ll regret.


When you become a pro at this, you can even just count down from five. Even that short amount of time can help you see whether or not you should keep quiet.

, If you want to be quiet, then you have to work on being a great listener. When someone is talking to you, make eye contact, pick up on important points, and try to read between the lines to figure out what the person is really saying and how he or she is really feeling. Let the person talk, don’t lose patience, and don’t fall victim to distractions like text messages.


Ask questions that help the person explain his ideas even more, but don’t ask something off-topic, which will confuse the person.
The more you work on being a good listener, the less compelled you’ll feel to talk all the time.

, You may be spending a lot of your talking time on whining about all of the things that annoyed you that day. You may have the urge to talk about the horrible traffic you faced that morning, the nasty email you got from a friend, or about how you just can’t deal with how cold it is this winter. But really, where does all of that verbal vomit get you? If complaining about the things you can’t change really makes you feel better, then write them down in your diary. There’s no need to complain out loud, is there?


If you have a real problem and need to talk about it, that’s fine; what we’re talking about here is the need to complain just for the sake of complaining.

, If you really feel antsy and want to start talking for no reason, just focus on your breath. Count how many times your breath rises in and out of your body and work on breathing even more deeply. Stop fidgeting, listen to what’s happening around you, and focus on how you’re thinking and feeling instead of on whatever it is you want to say so badly.


This technique will calm you down and will make you see that talking isn’t so important.

, You may be the kind of person who has an instant reaction to something that you hear and who wants to immediately blurt out everything that you’re thinking/wondering/sort of wondering, but this really isn’t the best way to tackle the situation. If you take the time to process whatever is happening and to fully form a question or a comment, then you’ll be able to speak much less and to ask or say something that is much more spot-on.


This will give you time to be your own internal editor and to not let out all of the “extra” stuff that isn’t doing anyone any good.

, Practicing being quiet on your own can help you be more quiet when you’re around people. One way to get some great practice being quiet is to find a hobby where you have to be quiet and preferably by yourself. Try painting, creative writing, yoga, song writing, stamp collecting, bird watching, or really anything at all that requires you to be quiet and to not say whatever is on your mind.


Reading is also great for helping you be quiet as you process the words in front of you.
Try going at least an hour without saying anything while you’re pursuing your hobby. Then go two hours. Then three. Think you can go a whole day without saying a word?

, You may be talking a lot – some may say too much – because you feel like you have so much energy and don’t know how to release it. So, find another outlet for saying all of the things on your mind that can help you get rid of all that extra stuff going on in your head.


Working out – especially running – can help you get some great exercise while getting rid of that extra energy. So can taking long walks or cooking. Find whatever works for you.

, Talking online only fills your life with noise and most of what you say isn’t really that important. If you really wanted to talk to your friend, you would do it over the phone or in person instead of incessantly typing away at your computer, wouldn’t you? The next time you have the urge to go on g-chat to see what your 28th best friend is up to, close your computer and go for a walk instead.

, Better yet, take a break from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and any other social media you may be using all too often. These sites are filled with noise, with people trying to impress each other, and with meaningless words that you may feel compelled to respond to. If you’re really addicted, then spend just 10-15 minutes a day on all of your social media sites instead of spending your time checking them every chance you get.


Wouldn’t you rather hear what your closest friends have to say in person instead of hearing what perfect strangers have to say to the world? Turn off all of the extra voices that you hear and focus only on the ones that matter.

, Make a habit of writing in your journal at the end of every day or week. This can help you write down those extra thoughts, stay quiet, and feel like you’ve gotten everything off your chest without telling your fifteen best friends about it. You can just write about what happened during your day, which will lead you to ask more questions and to write about the deeper things on your mind.


You’ll be amazed by how much quieter you may be if you write just one journal page each day.

, Meditating is a great way to turn off your mind and to keep your body and being quiet. Take 10-20 minute every morning to find a comfortable seat in a quiet room, close your eyes, and focus on your breath rising and falling from your body. Focus on relaxing your body one part at a time and notice what you hear, smell, feel, and sense as you’re sitting there. Banish any serious thoughts and focus just on being in the moment and appreciating the quiet, and you’ll be on your way to having a more centered, quiet day.


Meditating can keep you from feeling overwhelmed by giving you more control over your mind and body.

, Take a walk. Go to the beach. Look at all of the beautiful plants in the garden on the other side of town. Take a weekend trip to the woods. Do what you’ve gotta do to get closer to nature. You’ll be awed by the beauty and power of something so much more permanent than you are and you’ll feel all of your doubts and words melt away. It’s hard to keep chatting on and on about what you think will be on the next math quiz when you’re standing at the base of a beautiful mountain that has been in existence since the beginning of time.


Plug some nature time into your weekly routine. You can even bring your journal out to nature and write down your thoughts there.

, Sure, music may make it more fun for you to study, to go running, or to commute to work. However, music can create extra noise that makes you feel a bit more chatty, frantic, and excitable. Classical music or jazz can be okay, but loud music with catchy lyrics can create noise that will bounce around in your head and keep you from feeling calm and in control of your day.

, If you’re a naturally loud, talkative person, then you won’t be Miss Quiet overnight. But if you make an effort to talk a little bit less each day, to pursue hobbies and activities that make you more quiet, and to focus on being a good listener instead of a good talker, you’ll be able to become more quiet sooner than you think. So sit back, have patience, and enjoy the feeling of all the extra noise draining from your head – and from your vocal chords.

Get into a comfortable, relaxed position.,

Breathe in slowly through your nose.,
Put one hand on your abdomen and one on your chest.,
Exhale slowly through your mouth.,
Maintain a regular belly breathing schedule.,
Identify and locate any tension or unpleasant feelings.,
Try to consciously loosen your abdominal muscles.,
Choose a mantra to center your thoughts.",How to Perform Soft Belly Meditation," Before you perform any type of meditation, it's important to get into a comfortable position. Your muscles should be relaxed and you should be in a position that facilitates easy breathing patterns.Seated meditation is very common, but some people prefer to stand or lie down while meditating.
If you sit in a chair, be sure to put your feet flat on the floor. If you're sitting on the floor, position your legs however you're comfortable.If you lie on the floor, let your arms rest flat on the ground at your sides.
There is no right or wrong position to be in. As long as you are comfortable and capable of engaging in belly breathing, you can be in any position.;
, Closing your eyes can help you focus on the meditation and tune out environmental distractions. However, not everyone is comfortable closing their eyes during meditation, especially if they're in an unfamiliar or potentially unsafe environment., Soft belly breathing requires you to inhale slowly, fill your abdominal area completely with that breath and then exhale slowly. As you inhale each breath, focus on expanding your belly and loosening any tension there.Try to fill your lungs from the bottom to the top, rather than engaging in shallow chest breathing.
Use the muscles in your abdomen to force the old breath out from your lower belly until your lungs are completely empty.
Repeat the process as many times as desired.

, The key in any type of meditation is concentrating on your body's breathing patterns. This will help you remain focused in your meditation and engaged with your body. Concentrate on the physical sensations associated with breathing in and out as well as your body's response to each breath.Notice the sensation of air passing through your nostrils and feel your diaphragm rising and falling.
With each breath, try to locate any areas of tension in your body and release that tension with your each exhalation.

, The longer you meditate, the calmer you'll be. However, there is no prescribed duration for meditation. Even just one minute of spare time spent doing soft belly breathing can help relieve stress and ground your thoughts.Spend as little or as much time as you like on soft belly meditation.
If you want, you can set a timer for yourself so you'll know how long you've been meditating.

, Once you're in a comfortable position, you'll want to focus on inhaling slowly and deeply. Many experts recommend inhaling through the nose, but you can inhale through your mouth if you're more comfortable breathing that way.Let your belly fill with air. It should rise and expand like an inflated balloon as you inhale.
Make sure the air goes down deep into your abdomen and eventually fills to your upper chest area, but don't concentrate your breathing in the chest. This will cause shallow chest breathing, which is not the goal of this meditation.

, The goal of deep breathing in general, and soft belly meditation in particular, is to breathe with your diaphragm. That means that your chest should remain relatively level while your belly inflates and deflates.Putting hands on your body can help you gauge whether you're breathing properly.
The hand on your chest should remain stationary. The hand on your abdomen should rise and fall with each breath.

, As you exhale, you should feel your abdomen begin to fall. Try to use your diaphragm muscles to force air out of your body, rather than just using your lungs.If you're more comfortable breathing through your nose you can do so. However, exhaling through the mouth is typically recommended to establish a cycle of breath that travels in through one route and out through another.
Make sure that you exhale slowly and consciously. Remain focused on your breath at every stage of the meditation.

, The best way to get more comfortable with this or any other new habit is by making it a part of your regular schedule. Practicing every day will help you get more comfortable with belly breathing and meditation in general. It will also help you relieve stress and feel more centered in your day-to-day life.If possible (and if you're comfortable doing so), try to set aside at least 10 to 20 minutes to practice every day. If that's too much, you can aim for 5 to 10 minutes of practice time each day.As you get more comfortable, try to increase the number of times you practice each day.
Aim for three to four meditation sessions each day, or however much time you can comfortably set aside.

, Once you've gotten comfortable performing belly breathing, you may want to focus your efforts on relieving tension and discomfort in your body. With practice you'll be able to loosen your muscles during meditation, feeling less tense and more relaxed with every breath.Locating any sources of tension before meditating can help you focus on that area as you meditate.
With each breath, bring your awareness to that tense spot. Try to loosen those muscles, either through your breath alone or by tightening and releasing the muscles involved.

, The goal of soft belly meditation is to get better at relieving tension focused in your abdomen. These muscles typically tense up when you're feeling stressed or anxious, and shallow chest breathing does very little to help relieve that tension.Focus on the way your abdominal muscles feel before, during, and after each breath.
Try to soften your belly with each breath. This entails letting go of any tension or tightness in your abdomen as you breathe in and out rhythmically.
If you're having trouble releasing tension as you breathe, try consciously tightening and releasing your muscles while you breathe. This technique is often called progressive muscle relaxation and can be done with every set of muscles in your body., Many people use mantras during meditation. A mantra is simply a word or phrase that allows you to remain focused on the meditation and helps bring your mind back when your thoughts begin to wander.You can choose any centering word or phrase that you'd like.
If you're having trouble coming up with your own mantra, try using the phrase ""soft belly."" Say ""soft"" as you inhale slowly, then ""belly"" as you slowly exhale.Repeat your mantra any time your mind starts to wander or you get distracted by things in your environment.
As you repeat your mantra, return your focus back to your breathing."

Find a labyrinth.,
Make a labyrinth.,
While creating the labyrinth, begin the feelings of calm and reflection.",How to Meditate in a Labyrinth1," If you live near or can visit a suitable labyrinth, this will be an ideal place to meditate or take your spiritual walk. Labyrinths are typically found in such places as church courtyards or within churches, parks, spa resorts, educational institutions and even medical facilities, such as hospital gardens. Always seek one in a reasonably quiet and unhurried place, where you can walk the labyrinth undisturbed and stay at peace.


The Labyrinth Society and Veriditas have collaborated on a website called the World-Wide Labyrinth Locator at http://labyrinthlocator.com/. Go to the website and type in the town, state or country where you are searching. You can also pick a radius, such as ""within 25 miles (40 km)."" A list of public labyrinths in churches, hospitals, parks, etc. with addresses will show up. There may be some private labyrinths on the list as well where the owners will allow people to walk if they call ahead.;
, If you're not able to find a labyrinth, it is possible to create your own. Indeed, doing so can serve as part of the creative process and will help you to unwind literally, as the labyrinth unfolds before you. To make one, find a suitable area of sand, dirt or other ground material in which you can draw lines. Alternatively, tape down a lot of white paper and paint yourself a labyrinth on the ground. If making your own labyrinth in sand or soil, here are some suggestions for creating it:


Draw a cross measuring about 1.8 meters or 6 feet across. Place a dot in each quadrant of the cross.
Draw four curving lines that head clockwise in direction:

Join the top of the cross to the top right dot
Join the top left dot to the right arm of the cross
Join the left arm of the cross to the bottom right dot
Circle from the bottom left dot around to the bottom arm of the cross.


For more details, see How to draw a labyrinth.

, Take note of all the things you're experiencing, including the sun or breeze on your skin, the texture of the sand or soil beneath your feet and drawing stick and notice sounds about you such as bird song, the sound or water or waves, the distant babble of human beings experiencing living and the rustling of trees. Making the labyrinth should form an act of moving meditation or spiritual reflection in itself.

Be in the present moment.,
Meditate when you're a passenger.,
Meditate in your accommodation.,
Meditate while walking, hiking, or touring by foot.,
Meditate in nature.,
Enjoy your new food experiences in a meditative way.,
Listen as meditation.,
Visit meditation retreats.,
Express gratitude.",How to Meditate While Travelling," The purpose of meditation is to ground you in the moment and to help you become more aware of your surroundings. When travelling, you're already more aware of things around you because they're new. Yet, you can't possibly take in everything and the novelty itself can be a form of minor distress until you feel comfortable with it. Meditation can help you bridge the shock of the new with the comfort of enjoying learning about many new things and meeting new people. Meditation will also help you to be mindful of anything that you need to be paying more attention to during your travels.;
, Travelling on a bus, train, boat, or other form of transport can provide you with the opportunity to meditate as the journey meanders on. There are different approaches possible, including:


Shut your eyes and concentrate only on the rhythm of the engine, wheels, tracks, etc. of the transport method. Use this rhythm to aid your meditation, focusing only on the particular rhythm and excluding all else.
Count the number of cars you come across which are of a particular/favorite brand. Focus solely on seeing those cars that you have singled out for finding. Or count trees, signs, road markers, farmhouses, etc. Whatever you feel is the right object to follow.
Close your eyes and count. Count each breath in and each breath out, from one to ten, then return to one again. If you lose your way or your mind drifts, start again from the beginning as you shouldn't become out of touch with your breath and each count. This is a good way to while away the time of a long journey.
Simply relax. If it's a boat or train, and you're able to move around, find a comfortable corner in the sun or somewhere with a pleasant ambiance and simply relax your whole body. Let your thoughts disappear and

, Your accommodation will undoubtedly vary from place to place and you will need to make the most of whatever you get. No matter how spartan, plush, or bizarre your surroundings, you should be able to meditate still. Focus on the moment, switch off all distractions such as the TV and cell phone, and find a comfortable part of your hotel room, dormitory, or other accommodation arrangement to meditate for a quarter hour or so each day.


If you're sharing a room, either select a time of day when it's likely to be quiet or ask the concierge if there is something quiet where you can go to meditate. Many people will be happy to accommodate your wishes.

, ""Walking meditation"" can be a useful method of meditating if you're doing a lot of sightseeing or hiking as part of your travels. Walking meditation is a form of contemplative expression; use the time of walking to double check your posture (especially important if you've been wearing a heavy backpack or lugging bags around). Walking meditation can also be an opportunity to relax from the inner complaints about feeling sore or tired from walking.


Check your posture from head down to your toes.
Place one hand on your abdomen, the other on top.
Walk with an awareness of each foot lifting up slowly, moving through the air, and taking the heel of one foot barely in front of the toes of the other foot.
Keep the head and body trunk still.
Keep your eyes looking ahead at the ground stretching out in front of you.
Experience the changes occurring, ever so subtly, as you allow each foot to touch the ground, feeling the pressure exerted on the foot with each step taken.
Allow the act of walking to be your full focus, rather than being preoccupied with the destination, or where you've been.

, Many travel experiences include getting into natural environments, whether it's a botanical garden, a sanctuary, a nature reserve, or a national park. Wherever there is nature surrounding you, you have an opportunity to meditate while contemplating the beauty of nature about you.


Go out of your way to experience some nature while travelling. A journey to a new place is not complete without seeking out its natural aspects too.
Feel the colors, hear the sounds, and enjoy the energy from nature as you're amongst it.
Relax and seek to be at one with the nature around you. Pay full attention to the natural elements that are contributing to your sense of well-being during your journey.
Meditate on a flower. Flowers can be found anywhere, even in a hotel foyer. To meditate on a flower, look at the flower in great detail, with love. Take in every detail, color, and its totality. Notice any fragrance that it may have, and whether it is attracting other life, such as a bee, to it. Allow your attention on the flower to open up your experience of the wonders of existence.

, When travelling, you'll often come across new foods that you haven't tried before, or variations on foods you are used to. Not only does this offer a wonderful opportunity to open your mind to new experiences, tastes, and sensations, but there is a meditative opportunity here too. Pay attention to each and every ingredient of a dish. Can you name the particular ingredients?


Eat slowly to enjoy the experience of eating – this will aid your digestion and help with peace of mind.


Chew and swallow your food slowly. Before swallowing, make the food almost liquid.
Swallow the food mindfully. Experience the different tastes from the food and drink.


Use snacks as an entire meditation experience. For example, take a single raisin, or a slice of an orange, and turn it into an eating meditation. Become totally aware of the entire process of chewing it, feeling it on your teeth, tasting it on your taste buds, and swallowing it.

, When travelling, there are many sounds surrounding you, such as the rhythm of transport explored in an earlier step. Sounds can frustrate you if you're over-tired and anxious but they can also serve as an anchor and ground you if you take them and meditate on them. For example, the sounds of flight announcements, the sound of jet engines, the hubbub of people talking, the music at a cafe, the drone of lawnmowers can all be sounds on which you choose to focus and notice your feelings as they rise and fall. Sounds document the ebb and flow of life, they are neither positive nor negative, and there are empty spaces in between them. Listen attentively and be receptive to how the sounds can provide meditation simply through the act of focused listening.


Listen to a piece of music or a song. With portable music players, using music for meditative practices while you travel is extremely easy and can be done on any part of your journey. Pay attention to each note within the music, or to the instruments used, or to the words.

, It doesn't matter if they are of your own faith or beliefs provided they welcome travelers or visitors with open arms and are happy for you to participate in their meditation practices. Look online for retreats near the locations where you're traveling; most will make it amply clear if they accept transient visitors. Just be sure to conform to their rules and precepts, and to make a donation even if it's not required.

, As you travel, devote a part of your time to expressing your gratitude for your travel experiences.


Be grateful for the people who have made your travelling experience much easier, more engaging, and eye-opening for you.
Be grateful for the people who grew, harvested, and prepared the food you're eating as you travel.
Be grateful for the expertise of those who have transported you to all the different places you've been visiting.
Be grateful for those who have hosted you in accommodation, enabling you to sleep and rejuvenate so far away from home.
May all live in peace.

Identify what you hope to get out of meditation.,
Choose a meditation technique to meet your goals and personality.,
Manage your expectations.,
Plan your meditation time.,
Understand that you are already meditating.,
Set ground-rules.,
Find a good place to meditate.,
Relax before starting.,
Continue practicing.,
Reflect on your experience.",How to Meditate Without a Master1," Knowing what you want to get out of meditation is an important place to start since different meditation techniques can be used to reach different goals. Consider your motivation for meditation:For example, ask yourself if you hope to gain insight into a problem, improve your concentration, achieve a sense of calm, develop more energy, or better sleep? Are you interested in meditation as a way to overcome abuse, addiction, or other difficult life situations?;
, Now that you’ve identified why you want to meditate, determine the specific meditation exercises that will suit your needs. While most forms of meditation relieve stress and anxiety, certain types of meditation can provide specific benefits and work better with certain personality types.



Mindfulness meditation is good for people who are easily distracted and looking to improve their focus and concentration.
If you are an active person who has a hard time sitting still, you might want to consider a meditation technique such as walking meditation where you can move and be outside.

Loving kindness meditation is often recommended for people wanting to feel more compassionate and empathetic.

, There are a lot of books, articles, and online resources that promise amazing transformations, but it’s a good idea to keep your expectations reasonable. Changing the way you think or feel through meditation can take a long time to achieve.Learning how to meditate takes time and practice, so don’t expect to be comfortable with it immediately.

, Many people don't allow much time for meditation or choose a good time to practice it. Ideally, the best times are in the early morning or late at night, when it typically is more peaceful and quiet around you and you can relax properly.You can choose any time when you know your surroundings will be quiet and you can focus for a longer period.
Try to set aside 3 to 5 minutes for meditation at first, and gradually build up to about 45 minutes.
You might not always have the full time you would like, but planning your meditation time will help you get in the right mindset to meditate.

, Many people meditate without knowing it. When you relax with a cup of tea, paint a picture, or go outside and feel relaxed, you’ve had a meditative experience.


Take comfort in knowing that you already have some experience meditating and can achieve even better results with more focused practice.

, Learning to meditate is like any other kind of training, and establishing guidelines or setting ground rules will make your practice more successful. In addition to following a specific meditation technique, try to plan what you will do before and after you meditate.It can also be helpful to plan how you will respond or react if your meditation is interrupted or disturbed. Achieving meditation is difficult and it can be aggravating to have that state interrupted, but you can control how will respond and how you will get back on track.
Having the same routine before and after meditation will help you get in the mindset quickly and extend the benefits for a longer period..

, Choosing where to meditate is just as important as choosing when to meditate. You will want to select a location that is quiet, comfortable, and where you feel safe.If you live in a busy house, or in a noisy environment where there is little space or silence, look for an alternative location. It might require borrowing a spare room at a friend's or relative's house or booking a study room in a library. You can also meditate outside in a place like a garden, a gazebo or other outdoor structure where you can get away from others for a short time.

, Your meditation will be more successful if you can take a few minutes to relax before you get started. Try some of these techniques to get in the right space to meditate:


Practice tensing and relaxing groups of muscles.Imagine a tranquil scene.
Listen to soft music.
Take deep breaths.
Try stretching.

, Like any other skill, meditation is more effective when you practice it regularly. Meditation will come more easily if you schedule sessions frequently.Choose a time that works with your schedule and needs –once a day, twice a day, once a week, twice a week, even once a month if you're struggling to begin.
Try to make meditation a part of your routine so you don’t have to make a decision to meditate. It will just be part of your typical day.
It’s normal for some meditation sessions to be easier than others, so don’t be discouraged if you have difficulty reaching a meditative state.

, Each time you meditate, take a few minutes to reflect on your experience. Make some notes about what went well or didn’t go well.


This might help you identify behaviors or external factors that are making it harder to meditate. You will also learn which parts of your routine are most effective.

Stand in front of the entrance to the labyrinth.,
Center yourself by taking a couple of deep breaths.,
Acknowledge your coming meditative or spiritual journey within the labyrinth.,
Begin your walk.,
Continue to walk.,
Pause on reaching the center.,
Walk out.",How to Meditate in a Labyrinth2," State your intention as clearly as possible. For example: I want a solution to my problem with ... It could be anything that is troubling you.

, This is important because doing this you instruct your subconscious and all other parts of yourself to pay attention to your sincere wish of solving your problem.

, You may also say a short prayer or smudge yourself, depending on which faith you adhere to. Closing your eyes and reflecting or taking a simple bow are other nice ways to begin the process.


Decide whether you will walk barefoot or with shoes on. With bare feet, you can feel the texture of the earth beneath your feet and connect to its grounding forces.

, The first step sets the pace for your walk. It can be fast or slow. Choose your intention for the walk. Are you being spiritual, reflective, mindful, playful, creative or something else? If you're problem solving, your walk becomes a meditation when you surrender all your problems and just walk. Other parts of you have now a chance to process your request of a solution.


If you are very upset: fast walking in lets the emotions dissipate easier. Most people try slowing down their mind by slower walking, relying on the mind and body reflection.

, Keep your mind quiet, and still pestering thoughts each time they arise. Concentrate on the placement of one foot before the other and rhythmic, gentle and regular breathing.


If you're problem solving, walk as you didn’t have any problems at all, let it all go. Surrender to the activity of attentive walking. Let the burden (your problem) fall off your shoulders. Various parts of your being are now processing your wish for solution. All you have to do is to let it incubate and not interfere, let it be and let go of any expectations. Continue to walk as you didn’t have any problems at all, let it all go.
If you're going on a spiritual journey or seeking creative inspiration, again let it all go and just surrender to the experience of walking the labyrinth.

, You may stop here for awhile, sit or lay down if you feel like it and meditate or reflect. The main thing is to let yourself surrender totally to your inner process. It feels so good to have all the time you need.


If you don't have a problem, question or quest for inspiration, just sit quietly and let things be.

, When you are ready, just walk out. Accept the insights and gifts you may have received. Adopting a sense of gratitude will always facilitate resolutions. Offer your thanks for what you have learned.

Focus on your breath.,
Don’t worry about your mind drifting.,
Try counting with each breath.,
Put your focus into words.,
Review your meditation session.",How to Meditate Without a Master2," This exercise is more effective if you are relaxed but alert. Choose a place where you are comfortable such as a chair, a pillow, or the floor., Pay attention to any muscles that seem tense, and try to relax them. You often carry tension in your neck, shoulders, and back, so be mindful of these areas.

, Recent research suggests that meditation sessions are more successful if you start by thinking about the benefits you and your family or friends will gain from the process. Repeat this step during each session., Breathe deeply, and think about how each breath feels. Pay close attention to where your breath enters your nose, fills your lungs, and exits your mouth.Try to pay attention only to your breath, and tune out distracting sounds, feelings, and thoughts.
This is an excellent beginner exercise that you can do on your own. It can also help prepare you for more advanced meditation practices.

, It’s totally normal for your mind to drift while performing this exercise, and being able to identify when this happens is an important step in the exercise. If this occurs, focus again on your breathing.Learning to identify when your mind is drifting or worrying, and refocusing your attention will help deal with anxiety and stressful thoughts.

, To increase your focus on breathing and minimize drifting, you can start counting with each breath you take. Count on the exhale. , Our thoughts often distract us from thinking about our breathing, so try connecting your thoughts with your breathing. For example, as you breathe in, think to yourself that you are breathing in. When you breathe out, note that you are breathing out.

, Reflecting on how the exercise went will you improve your technique. Think about what you liked or didn’t like about the session.It can be helpful to keep a meditation notebook or journal that you can look back on.
If there are specific thoughts that keep intruding, write them down.

Get prepared.,
Identify the parts of your body that seem tense.,
Start a mental scan of your body.,
Continue with the scan.,
Eliminate distractions.,
Focus on connections between body parts.,
Pay attention to how your skin feels.,
Reflect on your meditation.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Meditate Without a Master3," To perform a full body scan meditation, set aside about 30 minutes. Pick a comfortable location, and lie down so that your back is flat.Make sure your phone, computer, and television are off so you can concentrate on the meditation.
Your bed or a yoga mat are good places to perform this exercise.
It can also help you relax if you dim the lights and take off your shoes. Some people also find it helpful to close their eyes.

, Before you officially start the scan, pay attention to the parts of your body that seem tense or painful. When you identify these areas, try to relax or soften your muscles.Holding tension in these areas will prevent you from being fully relaxed and enjoying as much benefit from the body scan.

, Pretend you are checking in with different parts of your body, and pay attention to how these parts feel. Focus on one part at a time.For example, if you start with your foot, observe how different parts of the foot touch the mat, your bed, or the floor. Do certain parts of your foot feel different from the rest? If you are wearing shoes or socks, think about how these feel against your feet.
Many people find it helpful to start with their toes and move toward their head. You can also start with your head and work toward your toes.

, When you finish reflecting on a body part, allow yourself to move on to another. Work your way to the top of your head.Don’t feel rushed or worry about the time. You don’t have to spend a specific amount of time on each body part. Just give yourself long enough to scan how each part feels.

, It can be challenging to eliminate distractions such as negative thoughts, the sound of traffic, or a radio in another room, but don’t let these intrude on your meditation.Allow negative thoughts and distractions from the world around you to fade away. If you find yourself getting distracted during the scan, don’t feel bad. Knowing when you become distracted is a beneficial part of the exercise because you will be better able to prevent this from occurring in the future.
Don’t feel like you are judging your body during the scan. Instead, you are observing how it feels and works.

, After you’ve scanned each body part, try to be aware of how they connect to one another at your joints. Notice how these connections feel., As a final part of the scan, think about how your skin feels.Are certain parts cooler or warmer than others? Can you feel different textures from clothing, sheets, or the mat?

, Now that you’ve fully scanned your body, try writing about your experience in a notebook or journal.Do you feel less pain or tension in certain areas?
What worked well with the exercise? What parts of the body scan seemed less effective? Were there moments when you felt distracted? What distracted you? How could you avoid these distractions in the future?

, Repeat this exercise as often as you would like to relax your body. The more regularly you perform a body scan, the easier it will be to maintain your focus and achieve the most benefit.

Start by standing.,
Begin walking.,
Think about your feet.,
Direct your attention to different parts of your body.,
Focus inward.,
Compare your mental and physical feelings.,
Come to a stop.,
Make the exercise your own.",How to Meditate Without a Master4," It might sound silly, but the first part of this exercise is to stand in place and pay attention to how you feel. Notice the shifting of your weight, what you feel in your legs and feet, what your clothes feel like.This step makes you more aware of all the thing your body has to do in order to stand and move.

, You might be used to speed walking from your car to the office or sprinting to the bus stop with your kids, but you’ll need to adopt a slower, more comfortable pace.You don’t have to move in slow motion, but think about how you would walk without a specific destination in mind.
This is a good exercise for people who have trouble sitting still or may feel restless when using other meditation techniques.

, Now that you’ve started walking, think about what your feet are feeling. Pay attention to your heel touching the ground, the ball of your foot as you lift off.You’ll also start to notice how your socks and shoes feel against your feet.

, Direct the focus to different parts of your body—such as your legs, calves, ankles, hips, and spine—and think about how these parts feel when you’re walking.As you think about each body part, try overemphasizing its movement to highlight what it does. For example, try swinging your hips more.
Think about how your different body parts connect, and what feels like in these places.

, After you’ve paid attention to your body parts, you can turn to your feelings and thoughts. Without fixating on a specific thought, just make an observation about what you are thinking or feeling., The goal here is to be simultaneously aware of how your body and mind are feeling. Try to achieve a state of balance so that you aren’t focusing more on one aspect than the other., Just like you started this exercise with standing, you will finish it the same way. You don’t have to jerk to a stop, but just slow your pace and stand still.Again, focus on what it feels like to be standing instead of moving.

, You can personalize the exercise to maximize the benefits. Here a few suggestions to get you started.Try using this exercise with any physical activity, such as running, riding a bike, or skating.
Think about a positive affirmation, a compelling quote, or a Buddhist principle, while you perform the exercise.
Devote as much or as little time as you can. One of the great things about this exercise is that you can easily find time to do it during your day. Try it while you walk the dog, push a stroller, or commute to work. If you’re doing it for the first time, give yourself about 20 minutes, and pick a restful quiet place like a park or garden.

Be aware that health insurance does not cover medical marijuana.",How to Put up a Medical Marijuana Dispensary," Many states have legalized the operation of dispensaries, but the laws also vary by county and city. Start with the Department of Health Services in your state, and then check with your municipal offices to be sure that you are allowed to legally operate a dispensary in your area.A full list of states where the sale of medical marijuana is legal is available from the National Conference of State Legislatures. You can also find information at the Americans For Safe Access website.;
, Because a dispensary is considered a business, it will need to be located in a commercial zone. You will need to acquire the appropriate permits and other documents before proceeding.


In many areas there are also additional restrictions. For example, in many California cities it is also not permitted to open a dispensary within 1,000 feet of a child care center or pre-K-12 school; within 500 feet of a residential area; within 1,000 feet of a park or library; or within 250 feet of any adult business that sells “drug paraphernalia” (pipes, bongs, etc.)., There is a significant level of risk involved in running a dispensary; in addition to the federal illegality, you may also face social stigma and difficulty with securing employees. Dispensaries are also a target for theft and vandalism.While being your own boss may feel very satisfying, be aware of the risks and stress that opening a dispensary entails and decide whether it’s worth it to you.


Many states require background checks not only for the operator(s) of a dispensary, but also for all investors and owners. Prior felony convictions, as well as other drug-related charges, may disqualify you from being able to obtain an operating license., Unless you are already an expert in the cultivation of marijuana, you will probably want to seek expert advice. Many dispensaries grow their own marijuana on site -- in some states, it’s a legal requirement -- so understanding how to run a growing operation is crucial to your dispensary’s success.Growing marijuana shares some risks with other agricultural crops, such as pests, fungus and mold growth on plants, and poor harvests. Seasonal weather patterns and even the daily amount of sunlight can also affect your plants. You should thoroughly research the risks and necessary techniques for cultivating marijuana.

, Because of the unique legal situation medical marijuana dispensaries face, it’s important to seek professional legal advice before purchasing or opening a dispensary. A lawyer will also be able to help you secure the appropriate permits and licenses, and make sure you are in full compliance with all city, county, and state regulations.


For example, in some states you may be required to classify your dispensary as a “non-profit organization” The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) maintains a list of lawyers experienced in marijuana issues., A business plan will help you find investors by providing them with a clear description of your company’s goals, assets, plans, and projections. Depending on the regulations in your area, you may choose to establish your business as a single proprietorship or as a corporation, or you may wish to form a collective or cooperative. In some areas, only collectives or cooperatives are legal. This is one of the reasons it’s important to seek legal advice before trying to set up your dispensary.


The U.S. Small Business Administration offers a website full of resources and information on writing a business plan.
According to a survey conducted by See Change Strategy, a financial news and information firm, 24% of dispensary operators had difficulty securing financing from investors.Banks are often reluctant to lend money to people wanting to open dispensaries., While costs vary depending on your location, start-up costs average about $250,000, but may range up to $500,000.This figure includes various costs, including the application for a license (usually nonrefundable), securing a storefront, growing or purchasing product, insurance, and other expenses.Even with a good business plan, it may be hard to secure traditional financing, so be sure that you have enough assets to invest before you start. If the regulations in your area allow for it, you can also minimize your risk by investing with partners.

, A CPA can help you navigate the financial side of your business. A CPA will know how to file the appropriate tax forms and can also manage your overall finances, including payroll.


Because marijuana dispensaries are still technically illegal at the federal level, they run a higher risk of being audited by the IRS. A good CPA will help protect you in the case that you’re audited.

, Because dispensaries are a high-risk (if often high-profit) investment, many people prefer to rent property before buying. If you are renting, disclose that you plan to operate a dispensary on the property. Keep all local ordinances in mind when looking for a property.There are tools you can find online such as traffic pattern information, demographic data (household size, income, etc.), and traffic ""generators"" such as other businesses and recreational locations in the area. These will help you determine what location will receive optimal traffic for your dispensary., Dispensaries can face significant social and community pressure, and if you don’t maintain a respectable, friendly image, you may well find yourself out of business. Always be pleasant and respectful to your “neighbors,” and consider doing the following:Keep offensive or overly drug-related signs, symbols, and images out of your storefront.
Operate a clean, well-lit store with friendly and knowledgeable customer service.
Hire security guards to keep loiterers and thieves away and provide patients with a sense of security.
Network with local government and police offices. Let them know you have no criminal intentions and that you are a respectable, community-minded small-business owner.

, Many traditional media outlets, such as Facebook and Google, do not allow marijuana-based businesses to advertise with them. Instead, reach out to local doctors’ offices that provide referrals, and promote yourself on websites such as Hemp American Media Group.And of course, build word-of-mouth through great customer service and quality products.

, There are hundreds of varieties of marijuana and a wide variety of ways to consume it, including smoking, edible products such as brownies and dried flowers, and oils. While there aren't many wide-scale, rigorously scientific studies available about what types and forms of marijuana are best for which conditions, your customers may have preferences or may have been told to find a certain type by their physician. Conducting some market research by doing surveys will help you stock the products your customers want the most of., Because of the uncertain legal status of many dispensaries, it’s vital that you keep careful records not only of your expenses, but also of all of the product, who interacts with it at what growing and processing stages, and the patients who purchase it. This information will help protect you in the event that you encounter legal trouble., No health insurance company in the United States currently covers medical marijuana, so patients must pay out-of-pocket. This means you will need to price your product competitively (usually, between $20 to $60 for one-eighth of an ounce, or about three “joints”) to maintain repeat business."

But having too little cortisol can be just as harmful to your health. If your adrenal glands are damaged, your body might not be producing a sufficient amount of cortisol to properly regulate your blood pressure and immune system. Here are common symptoms of cortisol deficiency:Weight loss and low appetite
Low blood pressure
Fainting
Fatigue
Vomiting, nausea and gastrointestinal pain
Salt cravings

Hyperpigmentation (dark spots on the skin)
Muscle weakness or pain
Irritability and depression
For women, body hair loss and decreased libido;
, If you suspect your cortisol levels are low, make an appointment with your doctor to schedule a cortisol test. A cortisol test involves having your blood drawn and sent to a lab to check cortisol levels. Cortisol levels are usually highest in the morning and lower in the afternoon and evening, and in some cases your doctor might decide to test you twice in the same day to compare morning and afternoon levels. Your doctor will be able to determine whether you have low cortisol or Addison's disease by comparing your levels to normal cortisol levels.


The ""normal"" range varies from lab to lab, but in general, the average morning level for an adult or child is 5–23 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL), or 138–635 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L). The average afternoon level for an adult or child is 3–16 mcg/dL or 83–441 nmol/L.Be sure to get your cortisol levels tested by a physician, rather than using an at-home method. Saliva testing kits advertised online are not as reliable as blood tests analyzed by a lab.
There are a variety of factors that can affect the efficacy of the test, so you may have to get your levels checked more than once. For example, if you're stressed, pregnant, on certain medications, or if you exercised right before the test, that could affect the level of cortisol in your blood., Once your doctor has confirmed that your cortisol is low, the next step is to figure out what's affecting your adrenal gland's cortisol production. The treatment your doctor recommends will be in large part determined by the source of the problem.



Primal adrenal insufficiency, or Addison's disease, is when your adrenal glad isn't functioning properly to produce cortisol because it is damaged. This can be caused by autoimmune disease, tuberculosis, infection of the adrenal glands, cancer in the adrenal glands, or bleeding into the adrenal glands.Secondary adrenal insufficiency occurs when the pituitary gland, which produces a hormone that stimulates the adrenal glands, is diseased. The adrenal glands may be fine, but since they aren't being properly stimulated by the pituitary, they don't produce enough cortisol. Secondary adrenal insufficiency can also happen when people taking corticosteroids abruptly stop taking them., The most common way to cortisol deficiency is through hormone replacement therapy. If your cortisol levels are low enough to need synthetic replacements, your doctor will prescribe oral corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone, prednisone or cortisone acetate. Taking your prescription in tablet form every day will raise your cortisone production.


You will need to regularly test your cortisol levels during hormone replacement therapy to make sure you don't have too much or too little cortisol in your body.
Oral corticosteroids have many different side effects; they can cause weight gain, mood swings, and other unpleasant symptoms. Talk with your doctor about things you can do to mitigate the side effects.

, If your cortisol levels are very low, getting into a stressful situation can be dangerous for you. Cortisol helps the body respond to stress, and without it, it's possible for the body to go into a coma. Your doctor may teach you how to administer your own cortisol injections in case of an emergency. When a stressful situation arises, you'll give yourself an injection of cortisol so that your body can adequately handle the crisis without shutting down., Hormone replacement therapy corrects the symptom, but not the underlying problem that's preventing your body from producing enough cortisol. Talk with your doctor about treatment options that may help your adrenal glands function at full capacity again.


If your adrenal glands have suffered irreversible damage, or if you have a permanent condition that will always cause your adrenal glands to be low-functioning, continued hormone replacement therapy may be the best option.
However, if the cause of your cortisol deficiency is related to a secondary factor such as pituitary disease, cancer, tuberculosis, or bleeding, there may be a treatment option that will restore your body's capacity to produce adequate cortisol.

, If your cortisol levels are low, but not low enough to require hormone replacement therapy, it's still important to keep your life as low-stress as possible. Learning to manage and reduce stress in your life will allow cortisol to gradually increase in your system instead of being produced all at once in high-pressure situations. The more stress you have, the faster your cortisol will get depleted.


Try stress management techniques like journal writing, yoga or meditation to teach your body to produce cortisol regularly and maintain healthy levels.

, The body naturally produces cortisol during the hours when you're sleeping. Get 6-to-8 hours of sleep per night and try to go to sleep around the same time each evening.


Create a peaceful environment with no light or noise to get deep sleep and aid cortisol increase.

, Foods high sugar and refined flour can cause cortisol levels to spike or drop to unhealthy levels. Eat plenty of whole grains, fruits and vegetables to help raise cortisol levels to a healthy amount.

, Grapefruit and citrus break down enzymes that limit cortisol production. Adding grapefruit to your diet on a regular basis can help your adrenal glands boost cortisol production., Licorice contains glycyrrhizin, which inhibits the enzyme in your body that breaks down cortisol. Inactivating this enzyme will help you gradually raise cortisol levels. Licorice is considered a very useful substance for boosting cortisol.Look for licorice herb supplements in tablet or capsule form at a vitamin or health food and supplement store.
Avoid using licorice candy as a supplement. It doesn't contain high enough amounts of glycyrrhizin to be useful.

, This can help increase your energy if you are facing fatigue.


Natural iron supplements can be taken if you need an increase in energy as well.

You will need a space where you can walk back and forth for at least 10 - 15 paces. If you are in a public place, find a spot where you will not be disturbed by other people.Before you begin walking, do some stretches. Rock from side to side and from front to back. Make sure your spine is straight, and you have good posture. If you are indoors, try walking barefoot or in socks.This may make it easier for you to be aware of your feet as you are walking.
Practice walking meditation indoors before you begin walking outdoors. There will be fewer distractions. Also, walking meditation often looks strange to other people. You do not want to be concerned with how other people will react to you.;
, Take 10-15 steps in one direction while breathing normally. Pause after you have finished your steps and then breathe again. Take as long as you like. Once you are finished breathing, take 10-15 steps in the opposite direction. Pause and breather again. Continue this pattern for at least 10 minutes.If counting the number of steps you are taking is distracting, pick a defined point on the path where you will turn around.
You can also meditate by walking in a straight path. Do not feel obligated to pace back and forth as you meditate.

, You can walk at any speed that choose. However, it is best if you walk slowly and take small steps. Choose a pace that feels natural and that is comfortable for you. Let your arms and hands move naturally as you walk as well.Walking meditation should not be strenuous or cause you to feel out of breathe.


Try different paces each time you meditate until you find a pace that works best for you.Remember that you are walking to connect to your body and mind, not to get in a good workout.

, Walking meditation helps create unity between your body and your mind. Breathe in as you take two or three steps. Then breath out and take three, four, or five steps. Modify the amount of steps you take with each breath. Find what is comfortable for you.No matter what breathing pattern you use, your breathing should remain slow and relaxed.


It may take a few times before you find your breathing and walking rhythm.
Avoid holding your breath as you are walking. Also, if you find yourself getting out of breath, inhale and exhale more frequently.

, A gatha is a short verse that you silently recite to help you focus your attention during meditation.This is particularly helpful if you find your mind wandering when you are trying to meditate. Take two or three breaths as you recite each line:Say ""I have arrived"" as you breathe in. Say ""I am home"" as you breath out.
Say ""In the here"" as you breathe in. Say ""In the now"" as you breath out.
Say ""I am solid"" as you breathe in. Say ""I am free"" as you breath out.
Say ""In the ultimate"" as you breathe in. Say ""I dwell"" as you breath out.

, Start with the part of your body that is closest to the ground and work your way up.Begin with your feet and then move to your ankles, to your shins, your calves, your knees, your hips, your pelvis, your spine, your stomach, your shoulders, your arms, your neck, and then lastly your jaw.Being aware of your body does not involve any thinking per se. Instead you are noticing the different sensations and how your body is moving.


Notice how your feet feel touching the ground.
Notice how your muscles contract as you take a step.
What kind of sensations are you experiencing in each part of your body?
Do you feel your clothing touch your knees or your stomach as you take a step?
How does your hip change positions as you lift your leg up or put your leg down?
Notice how your arms and shoulders swing as you walk.

, As you meditate you will have feelings associated with your body and feelings associated with what you hear and see as you are walking. You may have feelings of comfort, discomfort, pain, pleasure, like, dislike, or neutral feelings. There are no right or wrong feelings. Accept whatever you feel. You do not have to fight your feelings or try to change them.Do you feel any pain in your body as you are walking?
Is the scenery pleasant as you walk?
Do you like or dislike the sounds that you experience as you are walking?
Is any part of your body uncomfortable as you place your foot on the ground?

, The emotions you experience while you meditate will change. They can be affected by what is happening in your life at the time or the type of day you have had. Your emotions may also change during the course of your meditation.For example, if you had a hectic time at work, you may feel stressed or anxious at the beginning of your walk and feel more relaxed as your walk continues.

, You will experience many different thoughts and emotions as you meditate. As you experience them, categorize them into thoughts and emotions that are negative and those that are positive.Positive thoughts are thoughts that you want to keep. Negative thoughts are thoughts that you want to get rid of.For example, you notice that your shoulders are tense as you are walking, and you categorize this as something negative. You choose to relax your shoulders and cause tension to be released from your body.
There are no right or wrong thoughts or emotions when you are meditating.

, It may be difficult to be aware of your body, feelings, and emotions as you meditate. Start by only focusing on your body as you meditate. Once you feel comfortable with that, incorporate being aware of your feelings and thoughts. Gradually build up your ability to be aware of all of the different factors.The more you practice the better you will become.


When you first start practicing devote 20 minutes to walking meditation because it may take you longer to focus. Once you have gotten the hang of it, you can incorporate this practice into your daily life. Meditate while you walk from your car to the grocery store or walk up a flight of stairs.
Modify your focus based on your needs. If you want to become more aware of your feelings while you meditate, you can focus on your feelings only and not include awareness of your body or thoughts.

, Focus on the journey, not on the destination. Focus on the moment, not the past or the future. If your mind wanders, let it. Watch those thoughts pass, and let your mind come back to the present, to your breath. Take each step with the same intention and continue to be present.


Have no destination to which you will walk. Walk just to walk and with no particular goal in mind. When having a destination you are in the mindset of getting to that place only making the walk a means to the end.
With walking meditation walking is an end in itself so you are complete as you practice it. This will assist you being in the present moment rather than thinking about the future., Regular practice of walking mediation reduces depression,anxiety, and worry.If you are already seeing a therapist for your anxiety and/or depression, walking mediation is a great supplement to your therapy. The awareness and focus that you practice when you meditate can give you greater insight into your emotions, thoughts, and feelings. This improved insight will make your therapy sessions more effective.Image:Do Walking Meditation Step 12.jpg|center]]

Try doing 20 minutes of walking meditation, 3 times a week to get these benefits.You should see changes in 8-12 weeks.
Walking meditation will also help you when you try to concentrate or focus throughout the day.

, If you practice walking meditation regularly, you can lower your blood pressure, decrease risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and decrease chronic pain symptoms. You can experience these benefits whether you are in good health or if you are managing other health conditions.


You will usually experience some of these benefits after practicing walking mediation regularly for at least 8 weeks.
You are also getting in some physical activity when you practice walking mediation. You may experience weight loss and improvement in your physical functioning as well.

, Life is very busy. You may be rushing to get from one place or always thinking about what is next on your to do list. Walking mediation gives you an opportunity to slow down and tune into your mind and your body.Walking meditation is based on Buddhist teachings that focus on the importance of living in the moment and being mindful. Mindfulness is achieved through by reflecting on your feeling, body, mind, and mental objects.
If you have tried some form of meditation before, it may be easier for you to get in touch with your body by practicing walking mediation instead of other forms where you are sitting.

Think about the ways in which your worries are not reflected in reality.Look at the evidence. What evidence do you have that a particular thought is true? Are there more realistic ways of looking at the situation? Think about outcomes that are actually likely, rather than worse case scenarios.
Examine any irrational thought patterns you have. You may, for example, engage in all-or-nothing thinking. For example, ""If I don't ace this job interview, I'll be unemployed forever."" You may also label yourself. For example, ""If I stumble during this presentation, I'm a loser.""
Try to see the gray area instead. There are very few absolutes in life. You are not likely to encounter many situations that will completely alter the course of your life. When you engage in negative thoughts, replace them with positive ones. For example, ""I am going to do my best on this interview. Even if I don't get the job, I'll be proud of how hard I tried."";
, You may be prone to anxiety if you are unable to embrace life's uncertainties. If you have to know what's happening at all times, this will cause a spike in nervousness. Work on accepting and coming to terms with what you do not know.It is not possible to be certain about anything. You cannot predict the outcome of any given situation, so there's no sense in speculating. You don't know how tomorrow's job interview will go, so live with that. Do not assume it will be a disaster.
Challenge yourself when you find yourself searching for certainty. Ask yourself, ""What are the benefits of me knowing this information for sure? Will it really change the outcome that much?"" You should also look at what you assume is certain. For example, do you always assume things will go wrong? If so, this is not entirely rational.
You should always come back to asking yourself the question, ""Is it possible to be certain about everything in life?"" The answer is always ""No."" Therefore, you may realize constant speculation is not serving you any good.

, You want to see if there are any triggers for feelings of nervousness. You can work on approaching certain situations and people differently if they tend to affect your nerves. Try to be aware of your emotions throughout the day and pinpoint moments when you feel anxious.It can help to keep a worry diary. Carry a small notebook with you and jot down your thoughts when you start to feel anxious.
Notice how you feel around others. You may find certain people tend to increase your anxiety. It may be a good idea to lessen contact with those people.

, Mindfulness requires being aware of the present moment and tuning into your senses. This can keep you grounded and prevent you from engaging in thoughts that may trigger anxiety.Do not try to ignore anxious feelings. It's important to remain aware of your emotions. Acknowledge nervousness, but do not dwell on it. Think something like, ""I am feeling nervous at this moment."" Remember, feelings are fleeting.
Pay attention to the present. Tune in to the sensations in your body. Pay attention to all your senses throughout the day. What does this moment smell like, taste like, sound like, look like? Pay attention to any sensations you experience. This can keep your thoughts from spiraling out of control.

, There are some physical preparations that you can make to help prevent nervousness as well. Some things that you can do to physically prepare yourself include:


Getting plenty of rest. Aim for 8 hours of sleep every night so that you are well rested. This may help to prevent nervousness.

Exercising. Try to get 30 minutes of cardiovascular activity every day to help prevent nervousness. For example, you can take a walk, go for a swim, or ride a stationary bike.

Eating a healthy meal or snack. Hunger may produce symptoms that look like nervousness, so make sure you have eaten something. Try having a sandwich or an apple if you have not eaten in a while.

, It may sound strange, but it can actually help to make time to worry. If you're prone to ruminating over nerve-inducing thoughts, try giving yourself a set time each day to engage in worrying. This can be especially helpful if you're preparing for a big event. You can give yourself a little bit of time each day to indulge in nervous over a job interview or public speaking.Telling yourself to stop worrying may not help. In fact, you may actually worry more if you put pressure on yourself to completely shut out your nerves. Instead, try to indulge them in a controlled setting.
Set aside 20 minutes a day to worry. For example, after work, allow yourself about 20 minutes to worry. You can focus on general anxiety, or nerves about a big event. Promise yourself, after 20 minutes have passed, the rest of the day will be worry-free.
If you have trouble shutting out your worries, try distracting yourself after your worry period is over. If you shift focus to a particular activity, this can help lessen worry.

, If you have a big event coming up, you will feel less nervous if you're more prepared. Instead of indulging in your worries, do something productive. Prepare for the event at hand.If you're, say, presenting a speech at a conference, there are many things you can do to prepare. Write several drafts of your speech. Have a friend look it over and offer feedback. Look up transcripts of past speeches and papers presented at the conference.
People often feel more nervous if they feel underprepared for a given event. If you go into an event feeling like you've done all you can, you're less likely to feel nervous.

, Uncertainty can increase feelings of nervousness. Try to gather as much information as you can about an upcoming event. This way, when the event arrives there will be fewer surprises that could potentially trigger nerves.For example, say you're going to a job interview. Research the company, it's values, and the person who will conduct your interview. You can even look at images of the building online. Having a sense of the physical location can help you relax.
You can also figure out things like wardrobe. If you're uncertain of what to wear for an interview, call Human Resources and ask.

, If an event is coming up, try rehearsing. If you have some idea of what you'll say, you will feel less nervous about going into the event.For a job interview, practice giving answers to common interview questions. If you're giving a speech, rehearse your speech every night leading up to the event.
You can even do this for social events. Rehearse what you might say on a first date. Practice conversation starters before going to a big party.

, It's normal to feel anxious before a big event. However, try not to focus too much on your nerves. Doing so can create a situation in which you're nervous about being nervous.Try to think of the positive side of nervousness. If you're a little anxious before an event, you can channel that anxiety into excitement and charisma.
Accept some nervousness is normal. You can reduce nerves by focusing on the fact what you're experiencing is not unusual. Instead of thinking, ""I'm going to screw up because I'm nervous,"" think, ""What I'm experiencing is completely normal. I should not be embarrassed or ashamed.""

, A classic way to reduce tension and nerves is to simply channel your breath. When you feel nervousness arising, tune into your breathing.Place one hand on your chest and the other on your upper stomach. Try to take deep breaths that direct your breathing towards your diaphragm. If you are doing diaphragmatic breathing, the hand on your stomach will rise and the hand on your chest will remain relatively still.
Try to spend three or four seconds inhaling, and seven to six seconds exhaling. Focus on the rhythm and sensation of breathing to take your mind off your anxiety.

, Progressive muscle relaxation involves tensing and releasing various muscles in the body. This can be a great way to quell nerves in the moment.Tighten a specific muscle group for 5 seconds, and then release for 10 seconds. For example, start by tightening and subsequently releasing the muscles in your toes.
Move throughout your body, tensing and releasing your muscles. You can move from your toes, to your legs, to your thighs, and so on, until all your muscles have been tensed and released.

, Guided imagery involves imaging a relaxing scene. You can find audio programs online that guide you through a variety of calming images.You can download guided imagery routines on an iPod or iPhone. When you feel nervous, you can listen to a guided imagery routine.
It's important to engage with the routines. Pay close attention and utilize all your senses.
You can also use your own imagination to guide your imagery before certain events. For example, on the way to a job interview, close your eyes on the train and imagine yourself acing it. Engage with all your senses so you go into the interview feeling positive rather than nervous.

, Relaxing your mind is a simple relaxation technique that can help ground you when you experience nerves. Simply close your eyes and focus on your breath.As you focus on your breath, think soothing phrases to yourself. For example, ""I feel quiet"" or ""I feel safe.""

, Even doing a few minutes of cardiovascular activity may help to relieve tension and prevent nervousness. Try doing something that will get your heart pumping and that you can easily do in your environment.


For example, you could take a brisk walk around the block, do some jumping jacks, or do some squats.
Stretching may also help to relax you. Try doing a forward bend to stretch your legs and back.

Choose the breath.",How to Do Concentration Meditation," Ideally, your meditation should be in a space free of pets, distracting noises or other people. Some people choose to set aside a corner of a room in their homes for the sole purpose of meditation. Others prefer to sit outside, weather permitting.Sitting in the same spot might help increase your ability to concentrate. Your body will start to associate this area with meditation, and nothing else.
Many people find that morning meditation helps them start their day. Others prefer to meditate at the end of the day. An office that's private offers an opportunity to meditate during the workday.;
, Your body should not experience discomfort during meditation. The goal is to be comfortable in your body while allowing your attention to be focused completely on the object of concentration.Wear loose, comfortable clothing that doesn't pinch or cut off circulation. Clothing that gathers behind the knees when you sit is not recommended.
Concentration meditation is typically practiced either sitting or standing, but may be practiced lying down if necessary.

, Because you'll need to train both your body and your mind to meditation, start with short sessions, 5-10 minutes in length. You can repeat these short sessions throughout the day.Use a timer rather than a clock so that you won't have the distraction of checking to see how much time you have left. If you are sleepy, it may also keep you from falling asleep for longer than the time you've allotted.
Gradually work you way up to longer intervals of time. After several weeks of 10-minute meditation, for example, increase the time by 5 minutes, then 10 minutes.
There are many meditation timer apps available to help you, or you can use an ordinary kitchen timer. It doesn't matter what you use to set the time, so long as you let go of the need to attend to it.

, You may choose to close your eyes, or to keep them partially open without being entirely focused. If visually focusing on an object of concentration, make sure your eyes are entirely relaxed.Never strain your eyes or hold tension in your eyes. This includes your eyelids, the small muscles around the eyes, and the muscles which move the eyes.
You may hold your lips in a slight smile, lips closed.

, Many people chose to focus on the breath. Do not force your attention, or become frustrated with yourself when distracted. When distracted, simply redirect your attention. This form of meditation is not intended to be stressful or coerced.If you have chosen to focus on the breath, turn your attention to your breath as you inhale and exhale. One complete inhalation and exhalation will be 1 breath. In your mind, concentrate on the number 1. Then take another breath, all the way in and all the way out. This is breath 2. Continue until you've counted 10 breaths. Then start again. Holding your attention to this count will deepen your concentration meditation.
Your choice of objects may vary depending on the day, the situation in which you find yourself, or the experiences you have as you continue your practice. Allow yourself to experiment with different objects.
Enjoying the practice of concentration is a pleasure, but not a goal. Allow your feelings to arise as they will. Notice them, and let them go.

, The goal of concentration meditation is to train the mind for continual focus. When thoughts or feelings arise, notice them, and return your attention to the object of its focus.If you start to feel disappointment, frustration, or irritation with yourself for being distracted, this feeling itself is a distraction. Notice the feeling, and return to the object of concentration.
There is a subtle balance between holding onto the object of concentration too tightly and holding on too loosely. When concentration is held too tightly, you will feel a certain tension that impedes your spiritual progress. When held too loosely, you'll find yourself distracted.
Some people experience a shift in their awareness between themselves and the object of concentration. You may find that you feel a certain sensation of merging with the object. Do not be afraid: this is a common sensation, and a sign of deeper insight.

, This posture allows meditation free from the distraction of physical ailments, the feeling of having one's legs ""fall asleep"" and may be beneficial for people who work in a seated posture for much of the day.Stand with the weight on the balls of the foot, and bend your knees slightly so that your back is straight.
Turn your toes slightly inward, with legs shoulder-width apart.

, The traditional position for meditation is sitting, either on the ground or on a ""zafu,"" a small round cushion. Modern practitioners may choose to sit in a chair if necessary for physical support. The seated method allows for greater stability.If using a zafu, position it in a quiet area. You may choose to place it on a mat or blanket to prevent your knees from resting on the hard ground.
Lower your body onto the zafu. Position your buttocks on the top third of the zafu, so that your buttocks are slightly raised, and your knees are directed towards or resting on the floor. Use a cushion under your knees if you need to.
Imagine the top of your head being pulled with an imaginary string towards the sky, straightening the spine. Feel a soft curve in your lower spine.

, In a seated position, you can allow your hands to rest, palms up, on your thighs. You may also choose a more traditional position, hands together.Holding arms slightly apart from the body, gently bring your hands together as if holding a beach ball. Place your left hand over your right hand, palms up, thumbs together.
If your arms are short, you can rest them on a cushion placed on the thighs. This is particularly helpful if you are seated on a chair.

, The object you select should be one which is easy for your attention to rest upon, which brings pleasant emotions without too much excitement or boredom. If you select an object which has meaning for you, try not to allow its associations to distract you. The goal is to focus on the object itself.Choosing an object of the senses is an ancient meditation technique. Some traditions encourage meditation upon the elements (earth, air, fire, water). Others focus on sacred places within the body, or chakras.
There are literally thousands of possible objects from which to choose. Popular choices include: the flame of a candle, a sacred symbol or object from the religious tradition meaningful to you, a word or short phrase that is sacred to you.
Remember, it is the training of the mind, not the object, that is the goal of concentration meditation. A skilled practitioner might focus on a box of tissues with equal success.

, Focusing your attention on the flame of a candle is called Tatrek meditation.Position your body far enough away from the candle so that you can easily focus your gaze upon it.


Make sure that your candle is placed in a quiet, draft-free area. A flame that dances in the breeze will create worry that its flame will be extinguished.
Select an unscented candle for optimal concentration. A scented candle may distract from your meditation.

, In some traditions, this type of meditation is known as Lectio Divinio, or ""divine reading."" Read slowly. A certain word or phrase may draw your attention. When it does, allow your attention to remain upon this word or phrase for your meditation practice.You may memorize the word or phrase, or you may keep the pages of your text open before you, reading them again as needed.
The words of the text may become abstract, losing their former meaning. This is fine. The words themselves are not important. They are just a pathway towards the meditative practice.

, For concentration meditation, close the mouth and breathe through the nose, unless the nose is occluded. Breathing through the nose allows a greater range of sensation.The concentration on breathing meditation is called Zazen meditation. This form of meditation encourages the practitioner to focus on the fact of the breath. Counting each breath, starting at 1 and continuing through 10, is a form of Zazen practice.
Concentration on the physical sensations of breathing is called Vipassana meditation. These sensations may be outer, such as the feeling of breath against one's upper lip, or inner, such as the awareness of breath flowing into the upper, middle, and lower lung area. It may also incorporate the awareness of breath flowing to particular regions of the body known as chakras.

Make sure that 90-95% of your carbohydrates are complex carbohydrates.,
Increase the amount of water you drink.,
Read labels on the foods you purchase and eat.,
Watch your serving sizes of complex carbohydrates.,
Add flaxseeds to get more fiber in your diet.,
Eat more fish and skinless poultry.,
Eat more fruits and vegetables.,
Keep a diet diary for at least a month.,
Get your Vitamin D levels checked if you are pregnant.",How to Prevent and Treat Diabetes with Natural Medicine1," This means that you should try to limit any processed or prepared foods and cook from scratch as much as possible. Avoid boxed, canned, and “ready to eat” foods as much as possible.


Start shopping in the bulk section of your grocery store to get a better price for beans, rice, and pasta.
Buy fresh vegetables as much as possible. Frozen vegetables are fine, but fresh, organic, in-season vegetables are the best choice.
If you are pressed for time, try using a crock pot to cook your meals.;
, Complex carbohydrates are made up of individual sugar molecules that are strung together in long, complicated and often branched chains.Complex carbohydrates are found in whole, unprocessed foods. Examples of complex carbohydrates include whole grain bread, brown rice, buckwheat, millet, quinoa, oats, starchy vegetables such as sweet potatoes, corn, pumpkin and squash, beans, peas, lentils, nuts and seeds.
Avoid simple carbohydrates. Simple carbohydrates include added sugars like glucose, sucrose (table sugar), and fructose (most often added as high fructose corn syrup or HFCS). Consuming HFCS has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and obesity., Water helps flush out naturally produced toxins and helps maintain mineral (electrolyte) balance. Aim for about eight 8 ounce glasses of water per day. Talk to your doctor to determine if you have any special fluid restrictions or needs that you should consider.


Skip sugary beverages. Sugar by itself does not cause diabetes, but ingesting more sugar-filled beverages is linked to an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes.Try drinking water, unsweetened sparkling water, or unsweetened iced tea instead of sugary soda.

, Reading labels can help you determine the amount of sugars in food. Just keep in mind that manufacturers are not required to list added sugars. That is why it is best to choose whole, unprocessed foods as often as possible.Avoid any food that includes terms like “enriched” or “refined.”
Unprocessed foods do contain some sugar, but it is not found in high levels and it is usually in the form of complex carbohydrates.

, Serving sizes vary depending on the type of food and your needs will depend on your weight and other factors such as age, sex, and activity level. A general recommendation is to have 45-60 grams of complex carbohydrates at every meal.Eat most of your complex carbohydrates at breakfast and lunch and only have a small portion of complex carbohydrates for dinner.

, Getting enough fiber is essential to preventing and treating diabetes.Flaxseeds are great sources of fiber and they are an excellent source of the essential omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA.


In addition to providing essential nutrients that may help to treat and prevent diabetes, flaxseed and the fiber they contain can help with bowel movements and can help you decrease blood cholesterol as well. Flaxseeds are also associated with decreased risk of colon, breast and prostate cancer, and they may also help with menopause symptoms.Try to include a tablespoon of ground flaxseeds at every meal or 3 tablespoons of flaxseed a day.
Use a coffee grinder to grind your own flaxseeds or keep pre-frozen ground seeds in your freezer.

, Getting enough quality protein is an important component of diabetes prevention.Make sure that any poultry you eat is skinless to reduce the amount of unhealthy animal fats you consume and eat a couple of servings of wild-caught fish each week.


Wild-caught fish such as salmon, cod, haddock and tuna are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential to good health.

, Eat plenty of non-root or starchy vegetables such as broccoli, leafy greens, cauliflower, and beans. These types of vegetables are low in calories, high in fiber, and nutrient dense.However, when you eat starchy vegetables and root vegetables, you will need to take the carbohydrate level into account.


You can also eat fruit. Being diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes does not mean you can’t eat ANY sugars. It is just important to control the amount of sugars that you do eat., The diet diary should record everything you eat and any changes in how you feel. Make sure to record the quality of your sleep and make notes about any changes that may be due to the foods you are eating.


Keeping a diet diary can also help you to keep track of what and how much you eat during the day. This may make you more aware of what and how much you are eating and help you to cut down on certain foods if necessary.
For example, if you find that every time you eat a particular food, you get very gassy and have some bloating, you can avoid that food in the future.
Take note of potential food sensitivities. Food sensitivities may make you more prone to obesity and that is a risk factor for diabetes.If you suspect that you are sensitive to some food, eliminate that food for at least two weeks.
The most common food sensitivities are to gluten (a protein found in wheat products), dairy products, milk/ lactose, tree nuts, shellfish, eggs and soy.

, Low Vitamin D levels may be associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes. Have your Vitamin D levels checked and take supplementation if you are deficient. 1000-2000 IU/day of Vitamin D have been safely used in pregnant women.During sunny days, spend 10-15 minutes in the afternoon sun with some skin on your arms and legs exposed.

Select a workspace.,
Retrieve the materials.,
Gather your tools.,
Consider wearing protective gear.,
Soak the medical cannabis buds in the solvent.,
Stir the mixture.,
Strain the solvent-medical cannabis mixture into another container.,
Soak, mix, and strain the mixture a second time.,
Boil off the solvent in a double boiler.,
Boil off the solvent in a rice cooker.,
Fill syringes with the medical marijuana oil.",How to Make a Medical Marijuana Oil," When making your own medical marijuana oil, you need to work in a safe, open environment.


The space should be well ventilated—open all available windows and or use fans to promote air flow.
The space should also be equipped with a fire extinguisher—the alcohol you will be using as a solvent is extremely flammable, as is the oil itself.If you intend to use a stovetop, the space needs a gas or electric range.
If you intend to use a rice cooker, the space needs electricity.;
, To produce cannabis oil, you need medical marijuana and a solvent.


Procure 1 ounce of medical marijuana.If needed, you may substitute 2 to 3 ounces of medical marijuana trim.Purchase 1 gallon of high proof alcohol, such as Everclear, to use as a solvent. The high proof alcohol will burn off in the boiling process, leaving you with a very pure and potent medical marijuana oil. Do not use alcohol that is not intended for human consumption, such as rubbing alcohol., Over the course of this process, you will need a variety of tools. These include:


1 medium sized glass or ceramic mixing bowl. Do not use a plastic mixing bowl.
1 large wooden spoon
A straining device. You may choose from the following: muslin bag, grain steeping bag, clean pair of stockings, cheese cloth, chai tea filter, or coffee filter paired with a mesh strainer.
1 container to catch the liquid, such as a 2-quart mixing cup
1 silicon spatula1 double boiler (for range) or rice cooker and candle warmerPlastic oral syringes, The process of making your own medical marijuana oil can be dangerous. Use caution and consider protecting your body with the following items:


Safety paint or odor respirator mask
Non-latex gloves.
Oven mitts or hot pads
Safety glasses, Pour the medical marijuana buds into a medium sized glass or ceramic mixing bowl. Pour the high proof alcohol over the medical marijuana. Continue to pour the solvent until it rests 1 inch above the surface of the medical cannabis.

, Retrieve your wooden spoon. Mix and mash the solvent and medical cannabis together for 2 to 3 minutes. The constant stirring motion will aid the solvent in absorbing the THC from the medical marijuana., Retrieve your straining device and second container. Place your straining device within your second container. Carefully pour the mixture through the strainer and let the dark green liquid fill the container.


If you are use a bag or cloth, squeeze the contents of the cloth to get out all of the liquid.
The liquid is a mixture of the alcohol and the extracted resin from the medical cannabis., The first wash will remove approximately 70% to 80% of the resin from the medical cannabis. This second wash will remove the rest of the THC.


Empty the contents of your strainer into the medium sized mixing bowl.
Pour the solvent over the cannabis so that it is fully submerged.
Use the wooden spoon to mix and mash the alcohol-medical cannabis mixture for 2 to 3 minutes.
Place your strainer over the second container, which already contains the dark green liquid from the first wash.
Slowly pour the contents of the mixing bowl in your strainer. Allow all of the dark green liquid to run into the container.
It is not necessary to do a third wash., When it is time to boil off the alcohol, you have one of two options. The first is to use a double boiler and a range. This is a very safe method.


Fill the bottom part of your double boiler with water.
Pour the dark green liquid into the top pan. If you can not fit all of the liquid in the pan, gradually add it as the level drops.
Turn the burner on high and wait for the liquid in the top pot to boil.
Once the liquid in the top pot is bubbling (the alcohol is evaporating), turn off the burner immediately. The heat from the boiling water below will continue to burn off the alcohol.
Allow the contents in the top pan to bubble for 15 to 25 minutes. Occasionally scrape the sides and bottom of the pan with your silicon spatula. If the contents stop bubbling, but still appear runny, turn on the burner to low. Once the contents resume bubbling, turn off the burner.
When the contents become a thick dark green syrup, all of the alcohol has evaporated and all you are left with is the medical cannabis oil. The process is complete.
Remove the top pan from the bottom pan and allow the medical marijuana oil to cool. As it cools, it will continue to thicken., If you do not have access to a stove top, you may substitute a rice cooker for a double boiler.


Fill your rice cooker ¾ of the way full with your alcohol-oil mix. If you have more of the mixture, you can continue to add it to the rice cooker as the level drops.
Turn the rice cooker on “High” or set it to the “White Rice” setting.
Allow the solvent-oil mixture to boil down.
When the solvent-oil mix is becomes a thick, dark green liquid, put on oven mitts, remove the pan from the rice cooker, and gently swirl the mixture. (When the amount of bubbles rising to the top decreases significantly, it is time to remove the mixture from the rice cooker).
Pour the contents of the rice cooker into a glass or metal dish.
Set the glass or metal dish on a candle warmer. Turn on the candle warmer and allow any remaining CO2 to evaporate from the mixture.
When the contents are no longer bubbling, you may remove the glass or metal dish from the candle warmer. The lack of bubbles signifies that all of the alcohol has evaporated from the medical cannabis oil and the process is complete., For ease of use, store the medical marijuana oil in a plastic syringe. Slowly draw the medical cannabis oil into the plastic syringe by pulling on the plunger. If you have more oil than syringes, you may store any excess oil in a glass air-tight container. Keep your syringes and containers in a cool, dark cabinet."

Check your blood glucose levels often.,
Use your blood glucose levels to help you change what and how much you eat.,
Take insulin as directed by your doctor.",How to Prevent and Treat Diabetes with Natural Medicine2," Your physician will make you aware of your “target” blood glucose levels, but you may need to test these blood levels daily. These can be tested at home using a home glucose monitor with test strips. Depending on the monitor, you may need to get a pinprick of blood from your fingertips or from your forearm. These pinpricks are not too painful for most people, but they can be painful for some people. Target blood glucose levels are typically:morning (or fasting) levels of less than 100mg/dL (< 5.3 mmol/L),
1 hour after meals: <140 mg/dL (<7.8 mmol/L)
2 hours after meals: < 115mg/dL (< 6.4 mmol/L)

, Your blood glucose level test results can guide you into changing the types and amounts of foods you eat to lower the levels of sugar in the blood.If your blood sugar is high, you may need more insulin and you may need to look at what you are eating and decrease the amounts of sugars in your diet.
If the blood sugar levels remain high and you are on diabetes medications, those may have to be increased.

, Insulin is a natural hormone replacement treatment and is a widely used natural treatment for diabetes. It may be necessary to add insulin (by injection) in order to “force” glucose into your cells. Your physician will guide you as to how much insulin to take and how to take it.

Get regular cardiovascular exercise.,
Add strength training.,
Consider getting a personal trainer or taking a class.,
Change up your routine often.,
Look for little ways to get more physical activity.",How to Prevent and Treat Diabetes with Natural Medicine3," Exercise can help you control your blood sugar, so it is essential for diabetes prevention and treatment. Increased exercise makes your cells more sensitive and responsive to the insulin your body produces. Exercise can also lower your blood pressure and strengthen your heart, which is relevant because high blood pressure and heart disease are often associated with diabetes.Try to get at least thirty minutes of moderate exercise every day. When you are just starting out, low-intensity exercises such as walking are helpful as well.

, Strength training will help you to improve your muscle strength and efficiency. The more muscle that you have, the more calories you will burn and the easier it will be to maintain a healthy weight, which is a crucial part of diabetes prevention.Try adding in a couple of strength training sessions per week to your exercise routine to improve your overall fitness level.

, As you progress and get more fit, consider finding a trainer or a class where you can get individualized advice regarding target heart rates and types of exercise. To begin, walking is the easiest way to start, but you can also go swimming or join a yoga class., People often get bored with exercise routines and end up quitting before they achieve any real results. Therefore, it is a good idea to make your routine as varied as possible.Find things that you enjoy so that you stick with your routine. For example, if you have never been particularly interested in sports, you are not likely to stick with competitive sports.

, You can get more physical activity by looking for opportunities in your daily routine. For example, you can try parking your car at the far end of the parking lot when you go grocery shopping or use the stairs instead of the elevator at work."

Ask your doctor before adding herbs.,
Buy quality herbs and supplements.,
Try bitter melon.,
Consider Gurmar.,
Look into prickly-pear cactus.,
Add cinnamon.,
Take vanadium and chromium.",How to Prevent and Treat Diabetes with Natural Medicine4," Many herbs have not been tested for safety during pregnancy, so if you are pregnant or dealing with gestational diabetes, make certain you speak to your physician before adding any herbs or supplements. Also, even though these herbs and supplements are natural, they CAN interact with various medications.


You can also ask your pharmacist about drug-herb/supplement interactions.

, Make sure you buy national brands of herbs and supplements and that the companies follow Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). For herbs, make certain that the suppliers use pesticide and herbicide free organically and sustainably grown herbs.

, Bitter melon (Momordica charantia) is often recommended for diabetes control. However, bitter melon has been associated with miscarriages and induced abortions in animals, so it should be avoided if you are pregnant or want to get pregnant. Bitter melon has been shown to improve blood glucose levels, increase the secretion of insulin and decrease insulin resistance., Gurmar, also known as Gymnema sylvestre has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine and has been shown to improve the control of blood sugar.Gymnema is generally taken in doses of 200 mg twice a day. Gymnema appears to be safe in pregnancy, but speak to your physician before using., Prickly-pear cactus or nopal has been shown to improve blood sugar control. Prickly-pear cactus has not been tested in pregnancy, but has been used for centuries as food, suggesting but not proving that it is safe., Cinnamon has been used to help control blood sugar levels and is considered safe for pregnant women in the amounts used in foods.This corresponds to approximately 1 gm (1000 mg) every day. 500 mg of cinnamon taken twice a day has been shown to improve A1c levels (and the levels of blood fats). A1c is used to determine average glucose levels for the previous 3 months. Lowered A1c levels reflect improved diabetic control., Vanadium and chromium are trace minerals and have been shown to be essential for control of blood sugar levels in diabetes.They may also function as antioxidants. Keep in mind that these minerals are only needed in small amounts.


Vanadium should be taken as vanadyl sulfate at 50-100 mcg per day.Chromium should be taken as chromium picolinate at a dose of 400mcg per day."

Before you start enjoying your downtime, ask yourself a few questions about what you're expecting to get out of your downtime.,
Jot down a few downtime options so you have a good idea of what you want to accomplish and how much time to dedicate to each activity.,
Schedule the downtime.,
Say no.,
Stop thinking of excuses, get down to business, and focus on living to the fullest.,
Allow yourself to sink into the moment.,
Sleep in once in a while.,
Be idle for a weekend.,
Escape elsewhere through reading.,
Switch off.,
Grab a pal.,
Enjoy downtime.",How to Enjoy Downtime," For example:



Do I want to do something productive, just have fun and hang out, or catch a few Zs? Do I want to mix active and active options?
Is there someone who'd like to share downtime with me?
Is there something I've been meaning to do for a long time? Something I've missed?
Am I on a money or time budget? Does a budget even matter for my idea of downtime?;
, Only write down one to four items so that you won't feel overwhelmed and you'll only spend a little bit of time coming up with ideas.


If you have trouble thinking of things to do, call up a few friends or family, read a book and follow up with a cat nap, or visit a local or far-away park or museum. Effectively, use some downtime to plan future downtime!
If you don't like the idea of completely forgoing work or chores to include downtime into your life, consider rewarding work completion with a bit of play so it won't seem as hard letting yourself enter the downtime zone. For example, send out a few emails before playing Ultimate Frisbee with your dog.

, Many people avoid downtime because they haven't scheduled it into their busy lives. Yet, quiet or non-work/chore related time is essential because it gives you the space to reflect on your life, make plans and relive the best of your life through memories. Having a due date and time for taking downtime scheduled into your diary will help you get the most out of your downtime.


If you're worried about losing track of time and giving yourself too much downtime, think of an exact time when your downtime ends. Set an alarm if it will help you remember when to come down from cloud nine!

, Say no to the extra pile of work, the additional work hours, the yet-one-more chore. These things aren't going anywhere and you need to take a break. Decline to keep going with or taking on anything that drains you. Remind yourself that you are in charge of your life and that it is okay to say no to other people sometimes, so that you can make room for you. You will feel liberated, which in itself is a very enjoyable and restoring feeling.

, Let leisure into your life and stop telling yourself there isn't enough time or that something else is preventing you from having your downtime. It's the telling yourself that there isn't enough time that is creating that reality for you, so now you're doing the opposite and telling yourself that there is time! Just do it!


If you feel that other people or situations are preventing you from taking downtime, return to the step on saying no, as well as managing around these issues by coming up with solutions. For example, feel like you can't take time out because your kids won't do the house chores while you're not there? Draw up a chore chart for them to check off weekly with built-in rewards. And then take off that downtime you need!

, Once you're in downtime, it's ""me time"" and a good time to notice the now. Just think about what you're doing now and where you are now and push aside all thoughts about elsewhere and non-related things. Enjoy the smell, taste, feel, sights and sounds of wherever you are, embracing them for all the sensations they bring to your senses.


If work or chores creep back into your mind, gently acknowledge the thoughts before sending them packing. By objectively recognizing them for interfering thoughts, you can be gentle on yourself and remind yourself that they are not welcome in your downtime space.

, Go on, you're dared. It won't hurt you. It will envelop you in warmth, coziness and a good sense of relaxation. This downtime is an important way of telling yourself that you're not going to keep doing what you think you ""should"" be doing. Sometimes you need to break that mold.

, That's right. No laundering, floor mopping, meal making, tidying or sheet changing. These things are never done and they can be done either before or after your lazy weekend. Buy your meals, soak in the bath a lot and read, watch movies and go for long, directionless strolls. This scheduled weekend is doable because you have put it in your diary and promised yourself this luxury, so put away the guilt. The only rule about this weekend is to let yourself do whatever is fun––and nothing else.

, Reading is a great way to find yourself some downtime. Just be sure that it's not work or study reading though! Choose juicy, thrilling or moving fiction, excitingly informative fiction or a book of poems. Escape into the worlds and minds of others for a while and savor this downtime that both relaxes and teaches all at once.

, Distance yourself from the world's buzzing for a time now and then. Turn off the TV, stop reading the news, put the phone through to voicemail and don't answer those emails. Taking out some time to let the calmer side of life re-enter through simply listening, observing and not working yourself up with an overload of information intake is vital for rejuvenation. The news and emails will still be there post-downtime.

, If you'd like to have some downtime with a special someone or a group of friends, organize it in advance. Whether it's just lying down with a best friend and star spotting or playing paintball games at the local paintball emporium, having someone with you during downtime can be a great source of uplifting fun.

, It isn't much use if you find yourself just feeling guilty, worried or impatient during downtime. It's your time to chill and to let go of the usual daily grind. So let it be a time directed by your wishes, not your ""should do's"" and let yourself be as busily creative or as lazily slothful, or a mix of the two, as you'd like. Whatever makes you smile.

Schedule a daily meditation time.",How to Meditate Deeply," Picking a room with a door, away from areas with children or traffic would be best.;
, The ideal seat is not so comfortable that you can fall asleep, but adequately comfortable to sit in for at least 20 or 30 minutes.

, Low lighting can help to relax the mind, so consider candles or lamps, instead of fluorescent lights.

, Consider a time early in the morning or in the evening, when children are asleep and the phone is unlikely to ring.

, Find a comfortable position where you can stay without moving for 20 or more minutes.


Stretch your back before you begin, if you have been sitting all day. Twisting from the waist to the left and right in a seated position or doing yoga cat/cow and child's poses can release tension so that it is easier to focus on the meditation.
Relax your shoulders. Lift them up to your ears as you breathe in, then drop them back down. Keep your back very straight. Place your hands in your lap. Zazen meditation suggests that you place your left hand in your right hand, palms up and place your left thumb on top of your right thumb, as if you were cradling an egg. This should make a circle, suggesting infinity and also the unconscious--your non-dominant side being allowed to take over.

, Some meditators find it difficult to mediate with their eyes open, while some struggle to meditate with their eyes closed because drowsiness becomes too much of a problem.Consider actively focusing on ""nothing."" Look not at the blank wall, but through the wall. Blink when you need to blink.

, Most meditation is not more complicated than sitting quietly and breathing, when you get right down to it. Within that simplicity, however, is endless complexity. Begin counting down from 10. You can focus on the counting to get your mind to start calming. If you have more time and this practice is helpful, consider counting down from 50 or 100.


Breathe in deeply for a count of 8 seconds, hold the breath for 2 to 4 seconds, and breathe out over a count of 8 seconds. Repeat this breathing pattern for 2 minutes.
Feel the breath coming into your body and going out of your body. Imagine the oxygen filling your body and coursing through your blood. Feel the oxygen come into all the parts of your body, and continue focusing on your breath.

, One of the most difficult things about meditation when you're just getting started is the issue of what to do. You're sitting there, breathing in and out...then what? Eventually, as you practice meditation, you'll notice the thoughts that come and go from your mind. You might be focused on picking your kids up, what you're going to have for dinner, or some lingering stresses from your workday. Rather than identifying with these thoughts and allowing them to inhabit you, imagine them as fish swimming in a pond. Watch them move through your mind and out of your mind.Doing this distances you from your ego, allowing you to become more distanced from the ""I"" that thinks. Allow your thoughts to flow through your mind, continuing to focus on your breath, observe them, and let them go.

, Awareness may feel more like an energy than a thought, and it's very difficult to describe or to experience. This is why meditation is referred to as a practice, and why zazen essentially translates to ""just sitting."" What do meditation masters and zen monks do? Just sitting.


Recognize as you drift into thoughts about your surroundings or your life, but don't try to pull your mind along back to a pre-conceived version of ""awareness"" you might have. As you begin meditating, this will happen frequently and may be quite frustrating.

, In an old Monty Python sketch, two men are lost in the desert. They start crawling as the buzzards start circling in. Desperate for water, one of them looks straight into the camera and says, ""Wait a bit!"" At this point, the camera pans back to reveal an entire camera crew with a catered lunch laid out for everyone. The men eat and before too long, all the crew is wandering through the desert, desperate for water, until one of them says, ""Wait a bit!"" and the whole process is repeated.


Our mind can work like this. As you're watching your thoughts, you may think: ""But wait. Who is watching the thoughts?"" This can get into a frustrating struggle with your mind, common to ""just sitting."" Focus on your breath. This too, watch happen, and let it pass.

, By detaching from the thoughts as you watch them, by allowing your mind to happen, by allowing your body to happen, and your breath to simply happen, you're allowing your true nature to exist without controlling it yourself. You're detaching yourself from your ego and learning to embrace your true nature and love yourself.

, Return to awareness of the parts of your body that are touching the ground or chair.

, A positive thought process can boost your mood for the day.

, Stick to it. The process will get easier the more often you perform it.

Exercise regularly.,
Take short walks throughout the day.,
Stretch during the day.,
Do yoga.",How to Increase Blood Flow to the Brain1," All aerobic activity has positive effects on circulation and health. One research study concluded that moderate exercise improves blood circulation to the brain in older women.Walk for 30–50 minutes at a brisk rate of speed, three or four times per week.


The results of the study indicated as much as 15% higher blood flow to the brain.
Many studies suggest a connection between exercise and overall brain health, though there's no definitive research suggesting that that increased blood flow may prevent or reverse cognitive decline.
Aerobic activity is any physical activity that causes you to breathe harder, and raises your heart rate. Swimming, bicycling, dancing, and even sex are all aerobic activities. Find one that best suits your lifestyle, and engage in it with enthusiasm!;
, It's not necessary to commit to a lengthy exercise session to reap the benefits of walking. Taking short walks will also help increase the blood flow to your brain. Even a walk of three to five minutes will have a positive effect on your blood's circulation.


Use a timer throughout your day to remind yourself to take walking breaks. If you work at a desk, schedule short walks.
Take advantage of naturally occurring opportunities to walk. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Park at a distance from your destination. Get off the bus or train before your exit, and walk the remainder of the route.

, Stretching improves overall circulation, and prevents stiffness in the joints and muscles.Set aside a few minutes every hour to stretch your body.


Stretching increases blood flow to the muscles. While it's not possible to truly ""stretch"" your brain, by enhancing blood flow throughout your body, circulation will improve and increase.Simple stretches that result in increased blood flow to the brain include touching your knees or toes from a standing position. Alternatively, sit on a clean area with your legs outstretched, and touch your knees, shins or toes from this seated position. Be careful not to do anything that causes pain or discomfort in your back.

, Yoga poses often encourage putting the head below the heart. This directly benefits blood flow to the brain.Simple inversions include simply laying on the floor, perpendicular to a wall. Scoot your body forward so that your legs are resting on the wall, and your buttocks is close to or touching the wall.


More advanced inversions include raising your body above your head in a headstand or handstand. You may practice doing this by using a wall to help your balance. Remember, yoga should never be painful. Work with a trained yoga practitioner for more advanced inversions.
Inversions don't have to be vertical. Plow pose and fish pose are both poses that directly benefit the blood flow to the brain. Plow pose stimulates the thyroid, increasing blood flow to the brain. Fish pose stimulates the neck, throat and brain.

"
Breathe through your nose.,
Meditate.,
Quit Smoking.",How to Increase Blood Flow to the Brain2," Engage your diaphragm, in your abdominal area. This is also called ""belly breathing."" Breathing deeply moves the air and oxygen down into the lower areas of the lungs where most of the circulation of blood is.


Air entering through the nose enters the sinus cavities, oral cavities, and the upper part of the lungs. Breathing through the mouth will lessen the exposure to freshly oxygenated air.
Breathing with the diaphragm results in more oxygen entering this blood.

, Heartbeat and breathing slow during meditation. Often, meditation includes more conscious, even guided breathing.Deep, even-paced breathing will increase the saturation of oxygen in the blood.


Conscious breathing helps to relax the shoulders, chest, and neck muscles that may be interfering with blood flow to the brain.
Meditation has had proven positive effects. It lowers a person's stress levels, increases their ability to focus, and strengthens the immune system.
There are many ways to meditate. An easy way to begin meditation practice is simply to sit comfortably, eyes partially or completely closed, and count your breaths. When you have counted 10 breaths, start over. Continue to focus your entire attention on counting your breaths. When other thoughts enter, simply notice them, and let them go. Start over again at one.

, Nicotine restrict arteries, which prevents healthy blood flow to the brain. On the other hand, the brain's oxygen uptake and blood flow decreases by up to 17% immediately after people stop smoking.Smoking has been linked to strokes and brain aneurysm. An aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall.
E-Cigarettes contain nicotine, which constricts blood vessels and lowers the blood flow to the brain. They are not recommended as a substitute for ordinary cigarettes."
"
Eat more chocolate.,
Drink beet juice.,
Include ""superfoods"" in your daily diet.,
Consider nutritional supplements.",How to Increase Blood Flow to the Brain3," Studies suggest that the flavonoids found in cocoa beans may increase blood flow to the brain.Flavonoids can also be found in red wine, red grapes, apples and berries. Teas, particularly green or white teas, are another excellent source of flavonoids.Make sure that your overall caloric intake remains within healthy limits. Increasing fat or sugar levels to your daily diet may have negative consequences.
Research on the beneficial effects of flavonoids is still preliminary.

, Drinking beet juice has been shown to increase blood flow to the brain.Beets contain nitrates, which are converted to nitrites by naturally occurring bacteria in your mouth. Nitrites help to widen blood vessels, and help increase blood flow to the brain.


Nitrates are also found in celery, cabbage, and other green, leafy vegetables.
Eating fruits and vegetables high in nitrates is recommended for optimal brain functioning. Converting these foods into juices is the quickest way to ingest a therapeutic dose.

, Nuts, seeds, blueberries, and avocados are sometimes called ""superfoods"" for their high nutritional value. Research suggests that consuming these foods has a positive effect on maintaining a healthy brain into old age.Walnuts, pecans, almonds, cashews and other nuts are excellent sources of Vitamin E. Deficits in Vitamin E have been linked to cognitive decline. You can eat them raw or roasted. Unhydrogenated nut butters maintain their high nutritional content.
Avocados are high in monounsaturated fat, which has been linked to increased blood flow to the brain. Monounsaturated fat helps to reduce bad cholesterol from the blood, and leads to lower blood pressure.Avocados also provide nutrients to help improve your overall health.
Blueberries help protect the brain from oxidative stress, which deteriorates brain functioning. Eating one cup a day of blueberries — fresh, dried, or frozen — has been shown to increase brain functioning.

, Ginkgo Biloba has long been used to increase blood flow to the brain. Ginkgo also protects the nerve cells that are thought to be damaged in Alzheimers.Ginkgo should not be given to children. Studies done using ginkgo with adults have ranged between 120–-240 mg per day.
Ginkgo is available in tablets, capsules, liquid extracts, and dried leaves for herbal tisanes.

Give yourself a face massage.",How to Do Palming Properly," Rub the palms against each other or hold them under hot water (not too hot!). Prepare your palms like on the picture.


The base of your right pinkie will be on the base of your left pinkie.
If it is more comfortable, place your left palm on top of the right palm, making an upside down letter “V” with your palms.;
, The base of the pinkie fingers will be right on the bridge of your nose.


Make sure you are able to breathe through your nose, otherwise, adjust the location of your palms and fingers.

, Keep your eyes open underneath your hands, turn towards the light (the sun, light fixtures, etc.) and check whether you are able to see the light through any of the holes between your fingers.


If you see light, correct the placement of your palms until you get perfect coverage that does not allow any light to your eyes.

, Now you are ready for a deep eye relaxation technique that will relax and calms your whole neurological system.


Do not concentrate on the eyes or area behind them. Focus just on your breathing (it helps to fully relax).
Concentrate on how you inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale…

, Clear your mind and concentrate on relaxing.


Imagine an image that is relaxing for you. Try a black starry night.
Concentrate on the warmth coming from your palms but do not press on your eyes with your hands.
Sit or stand in a position so that your spinal cord is in a straight line. This will enable your body to physically relax.

, Trataka is an eye focusing exercise which can relieve and prevent eye strain from staring at a computer all day. Though not scientifically tested, you might still find that it helps.Hold your arm straight out in front of your face.

Enroll in a class.,
Pick up some poses.,
Learn how to breathe.,
Relax!",How to Live the Yogic Lifestyle1," First things first: to live the lifestyle, you need to start doing yoga. Consider joining a class at a gym, community center, or yoga studio, for example. Ease your way into the practice and prepare to feel better and more relaxed.


There are many reasons to start yoga. You will become better toned and flexible, enjoy more energy, and feel more relaxed. You may even lose weight.
Not many of us can afford a personal yoga trainer. However, you won’t break the bank by joining a class. The average cost of drop-in sessions is about $12. This price drops if you commit to a week or month-long program.A one-month unlimited plan at Yoga Tree in Toronto costs $160, for instance.While face-to-face time with an instructor is best, you can also make do with a good beginner’s yoga DVD , like Yoga for Beginners, Smart Start Yoga, or AM/PM Yoga for Beginners.;
, There are yoga poses that any beginner will have to know. These are basic and beginner’s level and include the Cat-Cow, the Half-Lord of the Fishes, and the Downward Dog. They are simple and easy to do.For the Cat-Cow, for example, start on your hands and knees with your spine flat. Then, inhale and drop your belly toward the floor and look up. Pull your spine upward, rounding your back, as you exhale. Repeat.Try the Downward Dog. Begin again on your hands and knees. As you inhale, push your hips upward, straighten your legs, and place your feet flat to the ground. Then, spread your fingers out and let your head hang down. Continue breathing in this pose.
It may take a while for you to catch on. Try sitting in the back of the class, so that you can easily see your classmates and follow their movements.
Don’t overdo it! Sit aside if you find a pose too challenging.

, You’ll need to learn how to breathe properly for yoga exercises, as well, especially when holding poses. The basic maneuver is a “three-part breath” called Dirga Pranayama. It involves breathing in and out of the nose into your belly and should be calming and relaxing.Dirga Pranayama is a continuous breath. Start by inhaling through the nose into your lower belly, then into your lower and upper chest. Your exhalation should start in the throat before moving down into your chest and abdomen.
If it helps, try resting your hand on each “station” as you breathe. Or, try isolating the movements while you learn. The breath should eventually feel like one continuous wave moving up and down your body., The aim of yoga is to quiet the mind and increase discernment, consciousness, and self-awareness. Try not to get stressed out if you have trouble in the beginning – if you find the exercises or meditation hard. After all, getting stressed out defeats the purpose of yoga. Yoga is not supposed to be easy, but it is supposed to enrich your life and center you.
The physical end of yoga – increased muscle and cardiovascular health – should also help you to feel physically and mentally relaxed.

Do some yoga or stretching.",How to Feel Relaxed," When it comes to food, they can work for or against your body and your mind. It turns out that certain foods cue our brains to give off certain hormones and put us in our happy places. Here’s a few you can try:



Mango. This tropical fruit is full of linalool, which has been found to lower cortisol levels (that little bugger of a hormone that makes us feel stressed).

Dark chocolate. Just a little over an ounce can reportedly calm the nerves and even start to stabilize metabolism levels.Gum. Chewing gum (the act of repeated chewing, actually) can help fight anxiety and stress, combating pretty much any negative mood.Complex carbs, like whole-grain breads and whole oatmeal. It turns out all carbs prompt the brain to produce serotonin (no wonder humans love them so much). Serotonin is one of those happy-making chemicals in your brain that make you feel good. Just stick to brown, complex ones for your health.Something crunchy. Studies have reported that stressed individuals often crave crunchy foods, and that’s likely linked back to chewing (that fights anxiety, as listed above). To calm the craving and the stress, nosh on some nuts, celery, or pretzels.;
, If it’s relaxing, of course. Studies show that listening to calming music that you like can help lower your blood pressure, heart rate, and reduce perceived levels of anxiety.And it doesn’t necessarily have to be calming per se, you just have to find it calming. So if it’s death metal that calms you, rock away.


It doesn’t hurt to dance it out, either. Not only is dance a great way to get in your cardio workout, but there’s science to back up the fact that it can lower anxiety, too.So hop on your bed and start getting jiggy for the sake of your body and your mind.

, Though journaling might not be your thing, you may want to reconsider: recent research says that writing down your worries gets rid of them and helps you feel more confident, which can improve outcomes, like test scores.You may not feel relaxed going into it, but afterward, you could feel a lot better.


If that doesn’t sound rewarding and relaxing to you, try just hankering down with a good book. If it’s full of jokes, even better. If you’re looking for something a little more constructive, try a word or crossword puzzle to get your mind away from the stress and into the problem-solving zone.

, It’s been around for centuries because it works: the soothing scents of aromatherapy travel up our olfactory system and into our brain, taking over where stress and anxiety once set up camp. Just a whiff of one of these smells can bring a relaxing feeling over your entire body.Rose, bergamot, lavender, orange, lemon, and sandalwood are all great options. But whatever scent makes you feel good is good, too.

, Did you know that chamomile, passionflower, and green teas all have stress-fighting effects? Yep.They’ve been found to reduce anger and even fight depression.So next time you reach for that latte, switch it up with a cup of tea instead.


There’s more science to back up honey as being an anxiety-fighter and a mood-uplifter, too.If you’re not a fan of these teas plain, try them with a teaspoon of honey for a total win-win.

, Did you know that just five minutes of meditation can start to relieve the symptoms of stress and depression?Just five minutes. So why not give it a try? All you have to do is find a quiet, peaceful place and start focusing on your breath. We all want easy, right? This is it.


More and more doctors are starting to recommend meditation for everyone to combat stress, anxiety, depression, and even chronic pain.We all have one of those. And you don’t have to get cross-legged on a mountaintop either. Outside or inside, sprawled out or not, just focus and you’ve got it.

, Maybe full-fledged meditation isn't up your alley, but how about some simple breath monitoring? It's been shown to even be able to lower blood pressure, fight stress, and lead to feelings of calm and relaxation.Here's how to get started:


""Equal breathing"" is where you breathe slowly in and out at an even rate. Start with four counts breathing in slowly, and four counts out slowly. Once you get used to this, throughout the days work up to five, six, seven, and eight counts of slow, equal inhalation and exhalation.
Another common method is deep breathing with your diaphragm. Place a hand on your stomach and breathe in through your nose slowly, lifting your stomach and not your chest. Aim for six to ten slow, deep breaths for per minute for 10 minutes a day., Sometimes all we need to is to mentally step away from our surroundings. A good way to destress from the moment, calm our nerves, and center our focus is to use visualization. Just close your eyes, and picture a place that makes you happy. Use all your senses, too. What does the air feel like? Do you smell anything?


Or get creative with ""creative visualization."" This is where you picture an event that makes you happy. Perhaps your favorite movie star knocks on your door and asks you to marry him or her. You immediately say yes and embrace in a long, loving hug. Now where do you want the honeymoon to be?

, The brain tends to associate places with feelings. It's why you're encouraged not to bring work into the bedroom, for example. But this can also work positively: if you can get your brain to associate a place with relaxation, that can be your space, or your zen zone. When you need to relax, come to this place and your brain may automatically decompress.It doesn't matter if it's a chair in a corner and some lit incense or a room full of golden and burgundy pillows. If it works for you and your brain, that's all that matters.

, Just how relaxing can a cubicle or your messy room really be? Humans have come up with some great things, but nothing we have created can rival the feeling we get when we're in nature. If life is stressing you out, get outside. Talk a walk, play with your dog, or just lie in the grass and soak it in (when's the last time you did that?). There's something about the natural world that can produce a sense of awed calm, leaving us breathing a little easier.


It's a good idea to make being in nature a part of your daily routine (you need that vitamin D, anyway). Exercise outside if you can, go for a short walk, or do some yard work to get outside and get your mind clear.

, If you're feeling really stressed, odds are you're not thinking about the physical moment. To get out of your head and into a more tangible reality, start by orienting and grounding yourself. Here are the details:To orient yourself, realize your surroundings. Where are you? What time is it? What's the weather like? If this were a novel, how would the author describe the setting? This gets you out of your head and into the world around you, which is free from stress and worry.
Once you're oriented, ground yourself. This means getting in tune with your senses. How does the shirt feel on your back? Are your feet touching the floor? Do you hear or smell anything? This helps you realize how much is going on that you're not even thinking about at any moment and centers your brain on other sets of stimuli.

, You probably don't have your own personal masseuse on call (don't worry; most of us don't), so why not take a second to give yourself a hand massage. Why? They can lower a racing heart and provide almost instant feelings of relaxation.We use our hands all the time and barely realize how much work we're putting the muscles through (especially for those of us at computers). A little bit of muscle relaxation can lead to mind relaxation, too.


If you have the money and the time, a full-body massage from a professional can be just the ticket you need to find your inner zen zone and maintain a sense of calm. The focus on your body and muscles takes your mind out of your worry and into your body, helping you forget whatever it is you were once stressing.

, Another way to take control of your breathing and muscles and to get to relaxing your mind is through progressive body relaxation. To do this, start by laying down. Breathe comfortably, letting the moment brew. Move your focus to your toes and relax them completely. Once they're relaxed, move the focus to your ankles. Slowly but surely work your way up your entire body until every body part, no matter how small, has had its due. When you finally reach the tip of your nose, you'll be in such a relaxed state you won't want to get up.


You could also try progressive relaxation through breathing. This is where you start focusing on breathing slowly and evenly. Then, on the exhale, let go of a portion of your tension. Inhale regularly focusing on just your breathing, and let go of another portion of your tension on the next exhale. With each exhale, more and more of your tension will be released, and you'll feel more and more relaxed.

, It's pretty hard to give ourselves a really great massage, especially when it's hard to reach certain places, like the shoulders or back. Instead, try acupressure, a sort of touch-massage that releases tension. Every body has certain pressure points, and cluing into them balances our fluids and stabilizes our energies, leading to feelings of relaxation.To give this a try, simply try squeezing the pad of skin between your pointer finger and thumb. Hold it there for 5 seconds and release. Do you feel the tension melt off of you as you release the pressure?

, Both yoga and stretching have been shown to reduce anxiety and reduce stress levels, making relaxing much easier to do.Why? When you're doing either of these activities, you're focusing on your body, your balance, and your breathing, all three of which can take you away from the material world we're all so worried about and into a world of calm.


The legs-up-the-wall pose is one of the yoga poses that has been found to be particularly effective. It's fairly self-explanatory, too. With your butt against a wall, bolstered up by a few blankets, lift your legs up directly above you. Hold that pose for 5 minutes and come back down."

Recognize symptoms.,
Speak to your doctor.,
Run some tests.",How to Increase MCH Levels1," If you believe you may be experiencing low levels of MCH, take some time to notice and catalog your symptoms.Common symptoms of low MCH can include:

Fatigue
Shortness of breath
Bruising easily
Pale skin
General weakness
Dizziness
Loss of stamina;
, If you are experiencing symptoms of low MCH, it is best for you to discuss these with your doctor. Low MCH may be caused by anemia, certain types of cancer, parasites, digestive disorders (such as Crohn's disease or celiac disease), or other conditions. MCH levels may also be affected by certain medications.Be prepared to tell your doctor:

What symptoms you have experienced
When these symptoms began
Your medical history
What medications you are currently taking (if any)
What you normally eat

, Your doctor will examine you and run a series of tests. The results of these tests will help your doctor to outline the best course of action to treat your low MCH levels.Some of these tests will likely include:

a blood test that will examine your MCHC (mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration) levels
a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) test to measure the average volume of your red blood cells

Focus on the present.,
Practice gratitude.,
Consider mediation.,
Spend time in nature.",How to Heal Your Root Chakra1," Focusing on the present moment can help you feel rooted, and contribute to the healing of your root chakra. Pay attention to your surroundings, routines, and interactions with others. Avoid getting caught up in thinking about the past or future.Try sitting in a quiet spot for ten minutes each day, and take note of your feelings, surroundings, and present environment.
Focus on the sensory details of otherwise mundane daily activities, like how your gums feel as you brush your teeth.
Try wearing an object, like a bracelet or ring, that can serve as a mindfulness cue. When you look at the mindfulness cue, take a moment to focus on the present.;
, You can help cultivate feelings of contentment and connection by being aware of and grateful for the good things in life. Try placing a tiny slip of paper that states something you are grateful for in a gratitude jar each morning. You can also start a gratitude journal in which you write about things that make you feel grateful., Meditation can help relive stress and anxiety, contributing to your sense of security and safety. Create a daily meditation practice, even if you only meditate for a few moments each day. Try a meditation app like Headspace, Buddhify, or Calm., Cultivating a connection with nature can help you heal your root chakra. Try setting aside time each day to spend time outdoors. You can take a short hike, write in your journal on your favorite park bench, or go for a walk in the park with a friend after work."

Start practicing at home.,
Invest in good gear.,
Eat and drink well.",How to Live the Yogic Lifestyle2," Yoga doesn’t have to just be for class. If you are serious about living the lifestyle, it will help to practice every day at home. These sessions can be anywhere from 5 minutes to more than an hour. Commit what you can, as it will add to your self-discovery and growth.Pick a convenient time and place. You can choose the moment when you practice at home, but try to be consistent or even dedicate a certain time and area in your home to your special practice.Home practice also puts you in control. Go at your own pace. Choose your favorite poses while exploring a variety of yoga techniques.Most of all, be consistent!

, If you are serious about yoga, it’s time to go to your local store and get some essentials – mat, clothing, and other goods. Try to find gear that will be useful for either the studio or your own home practice.


Keep an eye on certain things in a mat. It should have good grip and padding (but not be too foamy) and also be light and portable. Expect to spend $50-$100 for a good quality mat.Go for tight rather than loose-fitting clothes. Tighter-fitting apparel will prevent accidental “exposure” when you are stretching. For ladies, a low to medium support sports bra is another good idea. Above all, you should be able to move comfortably.You might also consider shelling out for some yoga blocks. These will help with support while you practice. While many studios provide them on-site, blocks are useful to have for home practice. Expect to pay around $20 per block.

, Doing yoga regularly, you will find that your body needs certain fluids and nutrition to function as best it can. Clean up your diet, drink plenty of fluids, and learn how to eat to maximize your comfort while exercising.


Water keeps you hydrated, which you will definitely need after an intense session. You should try to drink water in the time leading up to each class, but also in the hours afterwards. Aim for around 64 oz. of water per day.Time your meals. It’s usually not a good idea to do yoga on a full stomach. Allow at least one hour after eating for light meals; for heavier food, give yourself three to four hours.Consider going meat-free. There are practical and spiritual reasons to become a yogi vegetarian. First the practical: meat can take 4 or more hours to digest, so many people at least reduce their intake to avoid discomfort.
Spiritually, some yogis follow the concept of ahimsa. This is an ethical doctrine that says it is wrong to harm a living being, which certain people extend to eating meat."
"
Commit to yoga, mind and body.,
Focus on meditation.,
Try fasting.",How to Live the Yogic Lifestyle3," Most people who do yoga use it for physical exercise. There’s nothing wrong with this approach, but it leaves out yoga’s traditional mental and spiritual sides. If you are serious about being a yogi, learn more about the whole experience.Total yoga is “a system for relieving suffering of the mind.” Traditionally, yogis held that people suffer because of their egos, which strive for control.By teaching us how to calm the mind and quell the ego, yoga lets us live as we truly are and in harmony with the surrounding world.
If you are interested in the inner secrets of yoga, consider reading classical texts like the Yoga Sutra or the Bhagavad Gita or modern takes like Yoga: the Greater Tradition., One thing that you can do to connect to yoga’s spiritual side is to meditate. Meditation is a mix of concentration and breathing that, if done right, can help you to reach a different state of consciousness, where the mind is alert, relaxed, and directed inward.As part of yoga, meditation can reduce stress, lessen pain, and help you manage anxiety.But meditation can also open your mind.
Try to find a quiet spot and sit comfortably, with your spine erect. Close your eyes and take deep breaths. Focus on your breathing, in and out, and let your attention rest on the rhythm. It is OK if your mind wanders, but always bring it back to your breathing.Don’t expect to “get” anything out of meditation or to feel better or worse. The point is precisely the opposite – to free you from worldly anxieties and concerns.
Also, don’t worry that you are doing it wrong – there is no “wrong way” to meditate!

, You may have heard that fasting is good for you physically. Many people believe that it allows your body to “detox” and somehow expel harmful toxins. While the evidence for this is spotty,fasting is practiced in yoga and other spiritual traditions to help develop willpower and focus the mind. Trying it might help you to reach a higher level in your journey.


The idea behind spiritual fasting is not just to skip a few meals, but to overcome your bad habits and thoughts and control yourself in mind and body.
Some practitioners think that fasting for short periods helps you to build willpower as well as sensitivity and intuition.
Keep in mind that spiritual fasting should be undertaken with the guidance of a spiritual master. Fasting for physical wellbeing should be done with medical advice. You should NOT attempt long fasts."

Understand stress and relaxation.,
Define deep relaxation.,
Consider the benefits.,
Set the scene.,
Master “mindful breathing.” The term mindful breathing is sometimes synonymous with deep relaxation itself, because being able to focus on each breath going in and out is at the heart of every deep relaxation technique.,
Give “progressive muscle relaxation” a try.,
Consider “body scan meditation” as an alternative.,
Think about “mindful meditation.” Deep relaxation is in many ways a meditative process, and it can include elements normally associated with meditation, such as the use of a mantra.,
Look into visualization techniques.",How to Do Deep Relaxation," During times of stress, the body is flooded with chemicals that produce a “fight or flight” response. This response is very helpful when you are facing real danger, but modern life can lead to near-constant stress (and the body’s response), which can contribute to a host of physical and emotional maladies.In direct contrast to the “fight or flight” response, the body’s “relaxation response” is a state of deep rest (but not necessarily sleepiness). When this response kicks in, a person’s heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing rate may reduce, blood flow can increase, the muscles will relax, and the body may be more capable of healing.;
, There is no single, standard definition for this concept, nor single guide for a standard technique. The various forms of deep relaxation do, however, share some similar qualities.


Deep relaxation is sometimes known as “mindful breathing,” because the various techniques associated with the term tend to emphasize a focus on purposeful, slow, calm breathing as a starting point. Exerting awareness and control over one’s breathing is essential to practically every form of deep relaxation.Deep relaxation can also be called “yoga nidra,” and a focus on controlled body movements is common to most techniques associated with the concept. Yoga novices should not be worried, however, because deep relaxation emphasizes simple, easy movements., As mentioned, relaxation helps to counteract the effects of stress on physical, mental, and emotional levels. A bout of deep relaxation is akin to hitting the body’s reset button, helping to restore a chemical balance and return respiration, blood flow, and heart rate to normal levels.It may not be quite right to say that deep relaxation heals the body, but it does create an environment which is more conducive to healing.
On an emotional level, deep relaxation tends to replace anger, fear, and frustration with improved mood, concentration, and confidence.

, With some practice, variations on deep relaxation techniques can be utilized in just about any situation where you can turn your focus inward, such as on the bus ride to work or at your desk. Ideally, however, and especially when starting out, you want to find a calm, comfortable environment with minimal distractions.When possible, choose a room where you will not be disturbed for at least 15-20 minutes. Find a room that is not too warm or stuffy.
Most techniques are suited to lying down on the floor, on a comfortable mat or blanket. You can usually also do them while seated in a comfortable chair. Beware becoming too comfortable, however, or your deep relaxation time can easily become nap time.
Wear comfortable clothes that are easy to move in, when possible. You can also try to enhance the serenity level by utilizing soft music or soothing scents, but that is your choice.

, Get comfortable with mindful breathing before you attempt to move into additional deep relaxation techniques.Lie on the floor (preferably), or sit in a comfortable chair. Place your arms to your sides.
Be aware of your body’s contact with the floor (or chair). Let your body “sink” into it.
Become aware of your breathing, in and out. Focus on your abdomen filling and emptying, moving up and down.
Feel your tension leave with each exhaled breath.

, While many techniques can be considered deep relaxation, this may be the most common one associated with the term. It involves tensing and releasing muscles individually and systematically throughout your body.Begin with your “mindful breathing” positioning and technique.
Once you are sufficiently relaxed and focused, bring your awareness to your right foot. Focus on how it feels for a moment, then tense the muscle for several seconds, as tightly as you can do without pain.
Release the tension, and feel your stress exiting with the release. Remain in this relaxed state for a moment before moving on to the next body area.
One typical body coverage pattern is as follows: right, then left foot; right, then left calf; right, then left thigh; hips and buttocks; stomach; chest; back; right arm and hand; left arm and hand; neck and shoulders; and face.
Focus on tensing and releasing only the intended muscles in the intended order. It will take some practice. If tensing and holding muscles is painful for you because of a medical condition or otherwise, you should consider the alternative techniques described in this article.

, If tensing and releasing muscle groups causes you pain or discomfort, you can instead employ an alternative form of deep relaxation. Body scan meditation shares the focus on individual sections of the body, but without the muscle flexing.Follow the steps for progressive muscle relaxation, but focus your attention on each body area without the muscle tensing and releasing. Feel the tension leaving that part of your body as part of your mindful breathing and deep focus.
It is best to follow a set pattern throughout your entire body, but you can also guide your awareness back to areas that may need additional focus.
When you’ve completed your body scan, bring your awareness back to your entire body. You want to feel almost as though you are floating. Focus once more on your breathing, and slowly sit and stand up when you are ready.

, Focusing on a word or phrase, or alternatively your body sensations, your senses, or your emotions, may be your key to deep relaxation.Find a quiet environment and a comfortable seated or reclined position. You want to be able to focus deeply, but not fall asleep.
Find your focal point. It can be something you see or sense, such as a candle flame or the sound of leaves rustling in the wind, or an image or memory you create, such as a tranquil lake or the meaningful word or phrase you choose as your mantra.
Don’t be distressed or distracted if other words or images pop into your head as you meditate. Don’t try to actively fight them or force them out; instead, focus your energies on returning to your focal point.

, Similar in many respects to mindful meditation, visualization methods rely on deep focus on a single mental image. Usually, though, the particular goal with visualization is to locate and picture your “restful place.”You want to try to engage all your senses with your restful place. If it is a pristine beach, try to smell the salt water, feel the breeze, and hear the crashing waves, in addition to visualizing the scene.
Visualization can be self-directed, but many people find guided visualization more effective. In this method, a therapist, coach, or a recording guide you into your restful place. For some people, this guidance permits them to let go, enter their restful place, and experience relaxation more completely."

Talk to your doctor.",How to Control Adrenaline," Sudden surges in adrenaline may evoke certain physical symptoms, many of which can seem frightening if you aren't expecting them. By learning about these symptoms, you can make yourself less fearful of them, thereby preventing excess fear from feeding into those symptoms further.Your heart rate and breathing may increase as your body attempts to exchange oxygen more rapidly.
Blood flow will be redirected away from the digestive system. This may cause butterflies or the feeling of an upset stomach.
Increased respiration can cause an excess of oxygen, which may result in dizziness. Respiration can also cause dehydration or the feeling of a dry mouth.
Blood flow is diverted from fine motor muscles and redirected to large muscles and organs. This can cause tremors and sweating.
Additionally, blood flow will be diverted away from areas of the brain responsible for secondary functions, like speech, and redirected toward more essential functions, like vision. As such, your speech may slur and your pupils may dilate.;
, You can learn to control your adrenaline response by creating controlled situations that will cause adrenaline surges. Come up with a list of challenging activities that may produce the desired response.


Ideally, most of these activities should seem somewhat interesting and exciting even though they also make you feel uncomfortable. Your list can include big challenges, like bungee jumping, or relatively minor ones, like riding a roller coaster or learning to dance.
You may also want to include practical, ""real life"" situations in your list. Examples include making speeches and learning some form of martial arts or self-defense., Visualize yourself performing each activity on the list. Analyze the potential benefit of each activity and the anticipated adrenaline surge you might experience.As you imagine each activity, try to imagine exactly what you might see, hear, or feel. You can use knowledge you have from past experiences or research unknown situations for a more accurate idea.
Rate the adrenaline surge you'd expect to have by assigning it a number value. Activities rated at 1 would be fairly relaxed, while activities rated at 10 would be extremely intense.

, Choose at least one activity from your list to actually experience. You can choose more than one activity, if desired, but try not to overwhelm yourself.


Weigh both practicality and enjoyment when reaching your decision.
For instance, if you need to familiarize yourself with public speaking to advance your career, it might be in your best interest to give yourself some practice in a controlled setting.
On the other hand, if there are no pressing concerns to prepare for, the activity you choose should mostly be decided upon for the sake of enjoyment. Choose something you actually want to experience in spite of the challenge, but don't pick any activity that involves more fear than desire.

, Before engaging in your controlled adrenaline experience, you need to prepare yourself for the activity as thoroughly as possible. Doing so can limit the amount of anxiety you feel during the activity itself and may help build constructive habits regarding your mental response to nerve-wracking situations.


Do your research. If you'll be going on a thrill ride, learn about the ride itself and the precautions built into the ride to keep it safe. If you'll be taking a self-defense course, read about the course and familiarize yourself with any terminology or core concepts you'll need to know.
Practice alone, when possible. When you can practice an activity alone before performing it in front of others, it can ease some of the performance anxiety you might feel. For instance, you might practice making a speech in front of a mirror before delivering it to an audience.

, While performing your controlled adrenaline-inducing activity, focus on breathing deeply and calmly throughout the entire experience.


Inhale and exhale through the nose to control your breaths more effectively. Make sure that you don't hyperventilate or hold your breath.
If you are unable to naturally keep a steady pace, be more intentional about your breathing. Inhale through the nose for 5 to 7 seconds, then hold the breath for 3 to 4 seconds. Release it through your nose or through pursed lips, exhaling over a period of 7 to 9 seconds.

, Once you've managed to control your breathing, engage your senses more actively until you feel thoroughly aware of your surroundings.


Having an understanding of your surroundings can help you feel more prepared and more in control.
Use your peripheral vision. Look at everything directly in front of you, but make yourself aware of everything going on around you, as well.
Listen to the sounds surrounding you, too. Focus on any instructions being given, but also pay attention to what others are saying and any other ambient noise.

, Once you're breathing is stable and you're aware of your surroundings, focus your attention to the task at hand. Do your best to perform the activity correctly.


Some activities, like skydiving, will require an accurate performance the first time around. Others may not, though. For example, you don't have to ace your ballroom dancing course the first time you take it.
If you don't succeed or don't do as well as you'd like, try the same activity again. Quitting without succeeding may make you feel more anxious about tackling another challenge in the future.

, After the controlled activity ends, pay attention to your mental, emotional, and physical responses. You may still experience adrenaline-related symptoms even after the situation responsible for triggering them ends.


Focus especially on your breathing and heart rate. Your adrenaline response won't end until these two physical symptoms decrease to standard levels.
Identify your predominant thoughts and feelings, too. If your initial psychological responses are negative, you'll need to shift them in a more positive direction.

, If you still feel a rush or surge of energy coursing through your body, it might be a good idea to burn off the energy in a non-threatening, practical manner.Engage in aerobic activity. Go for a jog or hike in safe, familiar territory. Jump rope or do a few jumping jacks. Go for a quick swim at a community pool (as long as you know how to swim).
Let it out. Scream into a pillow, punch a pillow, or throw pillows across the room. Release your negative energy in a safe, controlled manner instead of trying to fight or hide it.

, An alternative way to calm down after your adrenaline surge is to engage in activities that relax you both physically and mentally. Everyone relaxes using different methods and techniques, so you'll need to identify an activity that you usually find relaxing to help yourself calm down now.


Talk to someone friendly and supportive. Discuss your experience and your current feelings.
Try taking a relaxing bubble bath. Set the mood by dimming the lights and adding a calming fragrance, like lavender, to the bathwater.
Play appropriate mood music. In particular, play music that sounds soothing or upbeat. By choosing music that matches the mood you want to be in rather than the mood you're in, you can guide your thoughts in that positive direction.

, Once the adrenaline wears off, analyze your controlled adrenaline surge from an objective, rational perspective.


Focus primarily on what you accomplished, but also think of constructive ways to improve.
Consider discussing the experience with someone else. Describe what happened in detail, and ask for helpful opinions and feedback.

, It isn't enough to practice controlled adrenaline responses only once. You'll need to turn these practice sessions into a habitual exercise. Doing so will make you more familiar with your adrenaline response, and as you grow more familiar with it, you'll learn how to control it even when unexpected circumstances trigger it.


Consider repeating the same activity multiple times. This may allow you to overcome any fear you have regarding that activity itself, and when you overcome one fear, your mind may begin viewing fear in general as something no longer insurmountable.
You should also practice the exercise with different activities. By presenting yourself with a range of adrenaline-inducing experiences, you can develop a more well-rounded response to adrenaline overall.

, Living an unhealthy lifestyle may make it harder for you to control your own adrenaline. By improving both your physical and mental heath, you might be able to simultaneously improve your adrenaline response.Try to get seven to nine hours of sleep each night.
Exercise on a regular basis. Jogging or running for at least 30 minutes three to five times a week can help burn calories, improve circulation, and enhance your overall health.
Develop healthier eating habits. Reduce your intake of sugar, processed fats, and caffeine. Try to develop a more balanced diet that includes food from each food group.
Spend time doing things you enjoy, especially when those things relax you. Talk with loved ones, hang out with positive people, go for a soothing walk, or participate in a favorite hobby.

, If your adrenaline response seems extreme or you're unable to control it on your own, there might be some chemical imbalance or deeper psychological issue behind it. Consider talking to your doctor about possible conditions and professional treatment options.


Your doctor may diagnose you with some form of anxiety disorder. Depending on the severity and specific circumstances, treatment may include medications, herbal remedies, cognitive behavioral therapy, or some combination of the three.

Fix the back support.,
Adjust the head rest for comfort.,
Sit so that you don't have to tilt your head to see in the rear vision mirror.,
Practice differential relaxation.,
Keep your eyes at the same level.,
Adjust the seating when visibility is poor.,
Stay calm.,
Keep the temperature even in the car.",How to Avoid Tension from Driving," The driver's seat position causes your body to sit at a flexed angle that is not a usual posture stance. The sagging of your lower back into the car seat will inevitably cause pain from the lack of support, so it is important to remedy this. Add a small lumbar support cushion; your sore muscles won't have to do so much work to keep you in place.;
, It is very important that your head rest is comfortable as this will help to minimize back pain.

, If you are constantly tilting, this will result in muscle and lower back tension.

, There are parts of your body that have little choice but to keep working while driving. Differential relaxation places a focus on relaxing those muscles not being used while you are driving. For example, while your neck and shoulders don't actually do the driving, they often end up being a source of pain from driving in one position repeatedly. Try to remember to keep your neck, shoulders, non-working leg, etc. relaxed as the other muscles do the driving work. Pull your shoulders down, sit up straighter, stretch your neck or shrug when waiting at lights, etc.

, As the day progresses, many people find themselves slumping through tiredness. Rather than stretching back to your proper posture, the temptation is to slouch and adjust the mirrors to suit the lower positioning of your eyes. Instead, aim to leave the mirrors alone and keep your eyes at the same level no matter the time of day. This will force you to maintain the straighter posture of first thing in the day.

, Rather than straining forward to see out of the window during rain, fog, snow, etc., it is far better to remain seated properly as usual and to simply move the seat forward a little to help you see better. If the visibility is so bad that you cannot see, take a break and rejoin the traffic when it improves.

, Being frustrated, angry, or enraged by other drivers is not only a waste of time (because you can't control events beyond yourself in this situation), it is a surefire way to build up muscle tension and bring on aches and pains. Acknowledge that it is annoying but go with the flow; think about something else, like planning your weekend or thinking through an idea. Put on music, etc. See wikiHow's article on practicing zen driving for more ideas.

, Tension can be brought on by being either too hot or too cold, as your muscles try to compensate for heat loss or gain. Also, being too hot or cold can impact your ability to concentrate, making you feel tense.

Define the negative emotions (or issues) that are causing you problems, then identify its intensity by assigning a level from 0 to 10.,
Clarify your setup phrase, which must be specific.,
Repeat your setup phrase while tapping the 'karate chop point' - the soft spot on the side of either hand - just below your little finger.,
Come up with a reminder phrase.,
Tap through all of the following points, repeating your reminder phrase:


Inner eyebrow, just above the inner ""corner"" of the eye, on the bone.,
Now that you've completed your first round of tapping, ask yourself what level the emotion/feeling/discomfort is at, on a 1 to 10 scale again.

,
Repeat the process until, at the end of the final round, when you rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, it's 2 or less.,
Your reminder phrases can then be ""I'm free of this now"", ""don't need it anymore"", ""I'm strong and confident"", etc.

",How to Use the Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT)," 0 would be ""non-existent"" and 10 would be the most severe.;
, For example, ""Even though I feel tense and angry when strangers look at me, I totally and completely love, forgive and accept myself anyway"". Or, ""Even though I fly into a rage when someone makes fun of my green hair and three heads, I totally and completely love, forgive and accept myself anyway"". Or, ""Even though I feel hurt, sad and devastated that (name of person) has dumped me, I totally and completely love, forgive and accept myself anyway"". Get the idea?

, Tap the point around 7 times (although there's really no need to count).

, This will be spoken aloud while tapping the other meridian points (refer to video below). Reminder phrases will be a brief reminder of the setup phrase, for example ""strangers looking at me"", ""hate being looked at"". Or, ""(name of person) dumped me"", ""dumped me!"", ""feel gutted"", etc.

,
Outer eye: outside edge of the eye, on the bone.
Under the eye: below the center of the eye, again, on the bone.
Under the nose, between the nose and the lip.
On the chin, right in the middle where the crease is
On your chest. Find the ""U"" shaped bone below your throat, go down 2 inches (5.1 cm) and then 2 inches (5.1 cm) either to the right or left.
Under your arm: where your bra strap is or three inches under the crease of your arm. Guys, make a good guess.
Some people also like to tap their wrist points at this stage: Insides of wrists facing each other, tap them lightly together.
Top of head: In the middle.

Take iron supplements.,
Beware of side-effects.,
Supplement vitamin B-6.,
Avoid taking too much calcium.",How to Increase MCH Levels3," If you do not enjoy eating iron rich foods (or on days when you're just too busy) another option is to take iron supplements. Iron supplements are inexpensive and safe., Unfortunately, iron supplements can have negative side-effects. Some of these are mild, and may go away as your body gets used to the medicine. Other side-effects (though less common) may be serious and should prompt you to seek medical care. Of course, if any side-effect is bothersome, or if you have questions, contact your doctor right away.Side-effects that do not usually need medical attention include:

Constipation
Diarrhea or vomiting
Leg cramps
Dark urine
Stained teeth
Heartburn


Side-effects that should prompt medical attention include:

Back ache or muscle pain
Severe nausea or vomiting
Metallic taste
Dizziness or fainting
Pain, numbness, or tingling in hands and feet
Fast heartbeat
Severe headache
Flushed skin
Rash or hives
Trouble breathing
Swelling of mouth and throat



, Whether it is consumed in food form or by way of supplements, vitamin B-6 is a necessary companion for iron. Whenever you take iron supplements, pair these with a supplement of vitamin B-6., If you take calcium supplements, be sure that you do not take more than the recommended daily amount. A surplus of calcium in your system can make it more difficult for your body to absorb iron."

It's hard to truly relax if you've got to buckle down on a work project or look after a screaming infant, so plan ahead to make sure there will be few opportunities for distraction. Below are just a few things you may want to consider doing — everyone's life is different, so you may have commitments that don't match these exactly:



Ask for time off from work. If necessary, use a vacation day. Note that most managers appreciate advance notice — a few weeks is often enough.

If you have children, hire a sitter. Children can be adorable most of the time, but sometimes they're nightmares. Eliminate the risk of having a hair-pulling day with your children by putting them under the watch of a responsible caretaker for a day.

If necessary, make travel arrangements. Sometimes, a change of scenery can be just what's needed to relax. If you'd like to get out of town, buy tickets and make hotel reservations ahead of time to avoid hectic last-minute shopping.;
, As soon as you've decided to get out of bed (which, on your chill-out day, is whenever you want), start your day off with some relaxing time in the shower or tub. Warm baths and showers are proven to help ease the mind, relax tense muscles, and focus scattered thoughts.More importantly, however, they just plain feel good and give you a temporary chance to forget about everything else and focus on the pleasing sensation of the water — in other words, to chill.


People's tastes in terms of water temperature can vary greatly. Scientifically speaking, the most relaxing baths are a little less than piping hot — any hotter can actually force your body to work harder, rather than relax (though your bath will still feel good.)
Note that pregnant women should not take hot baths., Drinking caffeinated beverages may not be the first thing on everyone's list of relaxing things to do, especially if you're someone who gets jitters, headaches, and so on.However, if you're able to handle a little caffeine, drinking some in the company of friends can be a very chill, relaxing experience. In fact, according to some research, drinking coffee in the company of people you enjoy can have a noticeably relaxing effect. On the other hand, drinking coffee alone tended to lead to more stress., Are you an amateur Picasso? Have you been dying to hammer out some jams on your old guitar? Today's your day to indulge your passions! Chill-out days are great because they give you plenty of time to do the things you secretly wish you were doing while you're fulfilling your life's commitments, so don't be afraid to spend a few hours (or all day, if you wish) to sources of personal pleasure. Some things you might want to consider are:



Try your hand at a creative task. When was the last time you painted a picture, wrote a song, or composed a short story? If you can't remember, consider tackling one of these art projects today at your own pace.

Do a DIY home improvement project. Putting a little work into your home can be an immensely fulfilling activity (plus, it's usually a good use of time and energy in the long term if it cuts down on maintenance costs.)

Read a book. Real, honest-to-goodness paper books can be a rarity today. There's nothing quite like sitting by the fire with your favorite paperback for a few hours, so consider this relaxing option.

Play some video games. There's nothing wrong with vegging out on the couch for a few hours with your favorite game. However, if this is something you already do on a regular basis, you might want to consider devoting your time to a hobby you get to pursue less often.

, Filling up with a great meal can be a very satisfying way to chill out. If you want to practice your cooking skills (and save money compared to eating out), try cooking yourself (and/or any friends who can spare the time) a nice filling meal. There are literally thousands of high-quality recipes available online. A quick search engine query for your favorite dish should reveal dozens of good results (or, alternatively, try browsing our wide selection of recipe articles.)


If you don't feel like cooking, don't hesitate to get a table at your favorite restaurant or order take-out. Chilling with good food is too satisfying an experience to ignore!

, Just because you're taking a chill-out day for yourself doesn't mean you can't get anything done. Don't be afraid to deal with any long-term issues that need taking care of with your free time. Not only is it satisfying in the short term to accomplish meaningful tasks, it's also a good way to reduce stress in the long term. After all, every duty you take care of today is one that you won't need to worry about tomorrow. Below are just a few examples of things you may want to consider:


Paying bills
Sending letters/packages
Applying to jobs
Dealing with customer service problems
Taking care of government/civic duties (i.e., going to the DMV, voting, etc.)

, Movies are the ultimate form of passive, chilled-out entertainment (unless, of course, you choose a horror film or a high-octane thriller.) Try curling up with a loved one or some friends in front of a screen for a few relaxing hours at the end of your day to enjoy an old favorite or a new selection.


If you have time, you might even want to plan a movie night with your friends. You can pick a theme (i.e., creature features, etc.) or go freestyle — it's up to you.
Though it can be somewhat pricey today, heading to the movie theater/cinema with friends can be another way to enjoy a movie. If your friends aren't available, you can still go by yourself, though some people don't like this. Try looking for matinee showings to save money if you don't want to shell out unneeded cash.

, Some people enjoy ending a chill-out day with a fun night on the town, while others prefer to stay in and get to bed early. The ideal end to your day of chilling is up to you (and no one else!)


Don't feel pressured to go out if you don't want to — your friends will still be around tomorrow if you skip one night to get some sleep.
Conversely, don't be afraid to enjoy a single night out with your friends if it's been a while since you've had the opportunity to cut loose. The exception, of course, is if you have major obligations the following day, in which case staying up late and partying can leave you too exhausted to function.

, Let's face it — with daily stresses from work, school, and/or personal commitments, it can sometimes be easiest to relax with a little chemical help. This is OK as long as it's not overdone. For instance, a drink or two with friends at the end of the day isn't likely to be a problem for most people. There is even some evidence to suggest that moderate alcohol consumption (on the order of one pint of beer per day) can actually have some minor health benefits.Keep in mind, however, that getting over-intoxicated can be a major stress. For instance, not only can heavy drinking lead to hangover, nausea, and other unpleasant physical symptoms, but also poor decision making, which can lead to long-lasting stresses (like jail time) if you're not careful.

Stop what you're doing and take a quick break.,
Get ""out of your own head."",
Talk your problems out.,
Make an effort to smile and laugh.,
Release your built-up energy in a constructive way.,
Try meditation.,
Above all, make a plan of action and follow through with it.",How to Chill2," Often, you may not have the luxury of being able to plan an entire day around the mission of chilling out. Whether they're caused by work, school, personal relationships, or some other outside force, stressful feelings and thoughts can occasionally pile up and become intensely unpleasant. In these cases, it's not enough to plan a day off in the future — odds are that you'll want relief now. Start by taking the earliest opportunity to stop what you're doing, leave your stressful situation, and give yourself a brief opportunity to do nothing.


Removing yourself from the source of your stress — even just for a little bit — can be a huge help in relaxing. It's well-known among psychologists and business experts that semi-frequent short breaks can be a huge boon to creativity and morale, leading workers to be happier and more productive in the long run., Chilling out in a stressful situation is often just as much about your thoughts as it is about your actions. If you feel yourself getting stressed and agitated, don't let these negative thoughts overwhelm you. Try to think about your problems from a logical, detached perspective. Try to figure out why exactly you're stressed out. Is it because you believe you're being treated unfairly? Because you've been given too much to do? Because you aren't able to do things how you'd like them to be done? Thinking about your thoughts, rather than just focusing on the way you feel, can completely change the your attitude in a matter of minutes and even sometimes give you unexpected insights.


For example, let's say that you're almost ready to leave work on a Friday afternoon when your boss pops into your office and gives you an unexpected assignment for the weekend. At this point, as you feel the frustration building inside you, you can either give in to these feelings and fume over this injustice for the entire weekend or (preferably) start to think about why this peeves you so much. For instance, is it because you feel like your employer doesn't adequately reward you for the time and effort you put into your company? If so, you may want to make a long-term effort to find a new job or negotiate for a better arrangement.

, You never have to deal with stress alone! If you have the opportunity, try talking to someone else about the issues that are giving you stress. Explaining your problems to a friendly listener can help you understand them and psychologically ""vent"" by opening up about your negative thoughts. However, the American Psychological Association (APA) notes that it's important to talk to someone who's a patient listener and not someone who's likely to make you more stressed out.For example, in the situation above, it might be a good idea to call home after work to vent about your problems with a parent or sibling. On the other hand, it's probably not a good idea to talk to your annoying roommate about it — especially if tensions are already high because he's behind on rent.

, The last thing an angry, stressed-out person usually wants to hear is, ""Hey, turn that frown upside down!"" However, as obnoxious as it may seem, there's a kernel of truth to this advice. Smiling (and other ""happy"" behaviors like laughing) actually can make you happier because they trigger the release of chemicals in the brain responsible for elevating mood. By contrast, frowning and other ""unhappy"" behaviors can have the opposite effect, increasing negative feelings., One good way to deal with pent-up stress is to channel it into an outlet where the extra energy and tenseness will do you some good. For example, feelings of anger and frustration can make it easy to complete a long, intense workout (on top of this, exercise is a good way to moderate stress levels and improve your mood — see below for more information.)Other good ideas include channeling your energy into creative pursuits, like writing or playing a musical instrument.


In our example with the unplanned weekend workload, a constructive thing to do in this situation might be to head to the gym after work rather than go straight home. Here, we can take out our frustrations in a healthy way by going for a run, lifting weights, or, if we're really mad, clobbering a punching bag.

, Though it may sound pretentious or obnoxiously ""new-age"" to some, meditation skills have been proven to help some people manage feelings of stress and otherwise chill out. There's not really any single ""right"" way to meditate, but, in general, meditation involves removing yourself from distractions, closing your eyes, slowing your breathing, and focusing on untangling your stressful, worrisome thoughts. Some people hold complicated yoga poses while meditating, some mentally visualize ideas or images, some repeat a simple word or mantra aloud, and some even meditate while walking around!


For information (including detailed instructions on how to clear your mind of stressful thoughts), see our excellent meditation article.

, While all of the tricks above can be extremely useful if applied wisely, the most satisfying way to get rid of stresses for good is to deal with them. It can be tempting to run from stresses at work, school, or home, but confronting them head-on is usually the quickest path to relief. Plus, the satisfaction from doing a good job can lead to lower stress in the long run even if you have to buckle down at first to achieve it.


In our example situation, the best course of action is probably to complete our assignment as quickly as possible Friday night or Saturday morning so that we'll have plenty of time to do the things we want to over the weekend. When we get back on Monday, we may want to meet with the boss to discuss an arrangement that will avoid these sorts of ""crunch time"" scenarios in the future.
Resist the urge to cope by procrastinating. Delaying work now just leads to more stress later, especially if you have to scramble to meet a deadline. Once you've completed your task, you'll be able to appreciate your chill out time fully without lingering worries about how you'll deal with the commitments you've put off.

Get outdoors.,
Get plenty of exercise.,
Get plenty of rest.",How to Chill3," Above, we've dealt with specific, individual ways to chill out. However, this isn't telling the whole story — in order to truly live a chilled-out life, you'll want to adopt habits and behaviors that encourage a happy, relaxed state of being. One sure-fire way to do this is to make an effort to regularly spend time outdoors. It may seem clichéd, but large-scale scientific studies have proven that spending time outside — especially getting moderate exercise — noticeably elevates mood.Though the connection between time outdoors and a good mood still isn't 100% understood, sunlight seems to be a key part of the equation. In fact, studies have shown that being exposed to bright (artificial) light in the morning when it would normally be dark out can help people with Seasonal Affective Disorder feel better.For long-term benefits, try making outdoor activity a part of your weekly schedule. For example, going for a short hike every Saturday morning is a good way to get yourself feeling relaxed and energized for the rest of your weekend.

, As noted above, a single session of exercise is a proven, fast-acting cure for stress in the short term. However, regular exercise is also a great way to promote a relaxed, chill attitude in the long term. Though the biology behind the process isn't perfectly understood, scientific research has demonstrated that habitual exercise can act as a buffer against the sorts of unhealthy problems that can result from stress, especially depression.Check out our comprehensive article on exercise for all sorts of useful information on making exercise a part of your life, including sample routines for every skill level.

, The way we sleep can have a major effect on the way we feel when we're awake — just think back to the last time you pulled an all-nighter and try to remember how you felt the next day. While a single night of missed sleep can make you feel bad for a day or so, consistently getting insufficient sleep can be a major source of stress in the long run. In fact, people who consistently get poor sleep have elevated risks of suffering from stress-related disorders like heart disease, stroke, and more.For the best chance at a healthy, chill life, make an effort to get enough sleep every night (most health resources recommend about seven to nine hours per night for adults.)It's also important to recognize that the relationship between sleep and stress works the other way as well. In other words, just like a lack of sleep can lead to stress, stress can itself can make it difficult to get to sleep.

Make your surroundings appealing.,
Clean up your space.,
Turn off electronics when you can.,
Bring nature inside.,
Find a scent you love and spread it throughout your space.,
Invest in a quality mattress and bedding.,
Incorporate tranquil paint colors throughout your space.,
Adjust your thermostat to a temperature that makes you the most comfortable.",How to Create a Relaxing Atmosphere1," When your environment is chaotic, it’s difficult to feel relaxed. Making small changes to your surroundings can help your home feel like a refuge from the chaos, rather than part of it. It’s important to address your space’s visual appeal and cater to your own individual taste.


Even small changes, like rearranging furniture or adding a piece of art, will make your space more visually appealing. Be sure that your furniture fits in the room you place it in. For example, an exceptionally large sofa in a small sitting room will make the space seem cramped and uninviting. Relegate the sofa to a larger space if possible.;
, This is vital to creating a relaxed atmosphere. If you have an especially messy place, start small, with a single space like a desk or closet, and work your way up to larger spaces. This might seem daunting at first, but if you dedicate time each day to working on decluttering, then soon you will be able to reap the benefits of a clean, calming environment.


When you declutter your closet, get rid of any clothing that you don't love or haven't been able to wear within the last year. Unless a particular garment has a sentimental value, bag it up and donate it to a nearby resale shop.
If cleaning and organizing you place seems overwhelming, search online for professional cleaning companies. For a fee, you can pay someone to clean as much or as little of your home as you like. For your own peace of mind, be sure to use a company that performs background checks on their employees.

, Constantly checking emails and social media can generate stress, especially if you are a student or employee who brings your work home with you. Make an effort to unplug in the evenings if you can. Try alternative activities to relax, like reading or taking a hot bath instead of staring at a screen all night.


Unplugging is especially important to do before bedtime, as studies have shown that the blue light emitted from electronic devices can inhibit melatonin production and hurt your sleep quality., Keeping plants or flowers on display de-stresses the atmosphere of your space and helps purify the air. Some great choices include the aloe vera plant, which contains a gel that soothes burns and cuts, or the rubber tree plant, which is great for novice plant owners and has strong air purifying abilities., Avoid scents that are too pungent or overwhelming. Instead, focus on calming scents like lavender, chamomile, or even chocolate, which have been proven to have relaxing effects. Use scent diffusers or candles for subtly incorporating relaxing scents and ambiance.


Scents to generally avoid for relaxation include grapefruit, cinnamon, and peppermint, as these promote alertness and are energizing.

, Nowhere is relaxation more important than your bedroom. Since you will spend roughly one-third of your life in bed, it’s important that your bed and bedding create a relaxing space for you to recharge. Invest in a comfortable mattress and bedding. See this article for suggestions on how to Buy a Mattress.


Be aware that memory foam mattresses are well known for trapping heat. If you tend to feel warm when you sleep, you might want to avoid this type of mattress or invest in a cooling gel mattress-topper designed to offset the trapped heat from the memory foam.

, Shades of blues, greens, and grays all inspire relaxation. Neutrals like ivory and beige are also great choices. Avoid bright, vivid paint colors, which tend to energize rather than relax.

Save vivid paint colors for accent colors on items like pillows or throws, rather than painting entire rooms with them.

, Slightly cool indoor temperatures tend to make a space seem more relaxing. Approximately 68 to 70 degrees is a comfortable indoor temperature. For relaxation for sleeping, go a bit cooler to about 65 degrees for optimal rest."

Eliminate noise and distractions.,
Play some calming music.,
Block out unnecessary noise at work.,
Buy a quality white noise machine.,
Buy earplugs.",How to Create a Relaxing Atmosphere2," Noise from loud neighbors, noisy traffic, or nearby construction can cause stress and make your otherwise tranquil space stressful. Minimizing these distractions and incorporating peaceful sounds helps promote calm and relaxation in your space.


Blackout curtains help eliminate noise, as do double or triple-paned windows. Investing in heavy duty blackout curtains and upgrading old windows (if you own your own home) will help reduce outside noise.

, Studies have shown that playing music promotes relaxation, even in stressful environments. Music therapy is even gaining popularity among pediatricians as a successful means of calming children who undergo medical procedures. To reap the most calming benefits in your space, play calming, lyric-free music. Sounds of nature or a smooth jazz sound are great choices., For a relaxing work environment, invest in noise canceling headphones. If you work in an office or other location that permits the use of headphones, noise canceling headphones will decrease the amount of stressful noise that you will deal with while you work. These come in on/over the ear styles and earbuds. Regardless of which style you choose, make sure that your choice feels comfortable in/on your ears.

, In addition to a comfortable mattress and bedding, a quiet environment is vital for optimal relaxation before bedtime. White noise machines help drown out stressful background noise from loud neighbors or busy streets. Choose a white noise machine with a variety of sound options and volume settings so you can customize your sound.


Premium white noise machines run off an actual motor and internal fan, rather than simply putting out a noise that approximates the sound of a fan or nature. Check product reviews to ensure that you're buying the right white noise machine for your needs.

, If you would prefer to save your cash, an inexpensive way to reduce audible stressors is to buy earplugs. You can find these at any drugstore or hardware store.


Look for plugs that are made of cushiony foam and have a 33 decibel reduction (the highest rate reduction for earplugs).

Pay attention to your physical needs.,
Integrate aromatherapy into your routine.,
Practice yoga or guided meditation.,
Try vitamin D supplements.,
Play with your pet.",How to Create a Relaxing Atmosphere3," Even though creating a relaxing atmosphere is important, the most relaxing environment can’t make up for feeling physically and mentally drained. Coupling mental and physical care with your relaxation strategies will enable you to reap greater benefits.

, Aromatherapy for relaxation has been proven to work to relieve both stress and pain. Calming effects come from oils like vanilla, rose, or geranium. Less physical pain and stress will help you relax and find calm.


Mix your aromatherapy with water in a spray bottle and keep in your car or in your purse of briefcase. Spritz your wrists and neck periodically throughout the day to benefit from the relaxing scents while you're away from home.

, Calming exercises like yoga or Tai Chi can help you relax, reduce stress, and reap health benefits like lower blood pressure and lower pulse rate. See this article on how to Do Yoga Meditation for suggestions on incorporating yoga techniques for relaxation., Studies have shown that supplementing with vitamin D, the ""Sunshine Vitamin,"" can boost mood. If you prefer not to take a tablet, you can try stepping outside for fifteen minutes to get your RDA of vitamin D. You can find supplements at any drugstore or health food store., If you have a dog, cat, pot-bellied pig, or other pet, play with it! Spending quality time with your pet can relax you, comfort you, and even reduce blood pressure and risks for obesity. Aim for thirty minutes a day playing with or briskly walking your pet to maximize the relaxing benefits. See this article for tips on how to Have Fun with Your Dog Outdoors."

Do deep breathing exercises.,
Practice meditation, or try rejoicing, meditative prayer.,
Try visualization.,
Do progressive muscle relaxation.",How to Relax Your Mind1," Although the idea may seem obvious, deep breathing exercises apparently work wonders on relaxing your mind. Practice these daily and in times of stress to help soothe your anxiety.


Close your mouth and take a deep breath in through your nose. Try to time this inhalation so that it lasts for four seconds. Hold your breath for eight seconds, and then exhale your breath for a count of eight seconds. Repeat this four times total.
If you have trouble slowing your breathing this far, start at a faster pace and slowly work your way up to a longer time.
Feel free to adjust the time each inhales and exhale lasts, but be sure that your exhale lasts for twice as long as your inhale. Pause between each breath.;
, This is the process of clearing your mind by focusing on a specific thought, place, word(s), color or object. To meditate, sit (kneel or lie) in a comfortable position and think (or pray) about one specific thing. It may take upwards of ten minutes in order to completely clear your mind, but that is normal.


You can sit or lie down during meditation, but always keep your eyes closed to help you focus mentally/spiritually.
It is normal for restless thoughts to intrude on your meditation. Try to ignore them as best as possible, purposely focusing on (cherishing/praising) one specific thing.
Use guided imagery to help clear your mind. Imagine a place, real or fictitious, in which you feel at peace and stress-free. Focus on being in this place, including the details of what it looks like and how you feel in it.
Meditate for as long as you like, but resting for at least ten minutes once you have managed to clear your mind proves to be beneficial to overall stress level and focus.
Playing calming music, sounds or positive song phrase (such as: ""I just feel like something good is about to happen. I just feel like something good is on its way..."") can help you to focus better for your meditation. Always do whatever is necessary for you to feel your most comfortable.Meditation has proven to have health benefits in addition to causing mental relaxation, including lowering blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood sugar., This is similar to guided imagery in meditation, in which you imagine a peaceful scene. Picture the scene in your head for as long as you would like, but focus all your thoughts and energy on visualizing this place in your mind.

, This is a process by which you tense and then relax all the muscles in your body. Relaxing your muscles after having them tensed alters your mental state, and helps your mind to be as equally soothed as your body.


Start by tensing the muscles in your face one at a time. These might include frowning, knitting your brows, scrunching your forehead, and setting your jaw. Then, allow each muscle to relax.
When you finish with your face, move down your body until you have done this with all your muscles.
Hold the tense muscles for 5-10 seconds each before releasing in order to get the most relaxation from the process."
"
Take a deep breath.,
Pay someone to help you relax.,
Visit your pet.,
Spend some time doodling.",How to Cheer Up on Your Lunch Break1," When you first start your lunch break, it's good to make a clean break from your work. Take a moment to take a few deep breaths and clear your head. If you're going to cheer yourself up, you need to leave work behind for the hour.You can also try deep breathing or meditation. For deep breathing, simply close your eyes, and focus on your breathing.Try breathing in for four counts through your nose, and then hold it for four counts. Breath out for four counts through your mouth.;
, You have an hour or so to do what you want, so why don't you do something that really relaxes you? For example, you could go get a massage, which will help you relax all over, or go for something smaller, such as a pedicure., If you have a pet at home that you love and adore, consider taking a quick trip home to see it. Just spending time with a furry friend puts most people in a better mood. Plus, your animal will love seeing you for a few minutes!, If art is your type of therapy, take a break at lunch to spend some time making some art. It doesn't have to be elaborate. Just try a bit of doodling or even an adult coloring book, if that's more your style."

Are you consumed by the same thought over and over again? Are you not making progress by thinking about this particular thing? If so, this may be a sign that you should move on.
Have you analyzed the same situation from a million angles? If you've found too many ways to look at something before you decide how to act, you may be being counterproductive.
Have you enlisted the help of your twenty closest friends in thinking about a particular thing? If so, then it's time to realize that you can only ask for so many opinions about the same idea before you drive yourself insane.
Are people constantly telling you to stop over-thinking things? Do people tease you for brooding, being a philosopher, or staring out of rainy windows all the time? If so, they may have a point.;
, If you feel like you don't know how to stop thinking, you need to learn what it's like to ""let go"" of your thoughts, so that it's something you can do deliberately.Imagine that thinking is like breathing; you do it all the time, without even realizing it. But if you need to, you can hold your breath. Meditating will help you learn how to release your thoughts.


Just spending 15-20 minutes meditating every morning can make a dramatic impact on your ability to stay in the present and let go of all of your nagging thoughts.
You can also meditate at night to help yourself wind down.

, Running or even walking vigorously can help you take your mind off of all of those annoying thoughts and to focus on your body. Participating in something particularly active, like power yoga, martial arts or beach volleyball, will have you so focused on your body that you won't have time for your thoughts. Here are some great things to try:


Join a circuit gym. Having to switch to a new machine every minute when you hear that bell ring will keep you from getting lost in your thoughts.

Go hiking. Being around nature and seeing the beauty and stillness around you will keep you more focused on the present moment.

Go swimming. Swimming is such a physical activity that it's even harder to swim and think.

, Once you've said everything aloud, even if you're talking to yourself, you've begun the process of letting go. Walk around and pace if you have to. Once you've put your ideas out there, you've begun the process of putting them out into the world and out of your thoughts.


You can say them aloud to yourself, your cat, or to a trusted friend.

, You may have exhausted your own thinking power, but someone else might be able to offer a different perspective that makes the decision clearer. This can help let go of your troubling thoughts. Your friend can make you feel better, can ease your problems, and can also make you realize when you're spending way too much time thinking.


Besides, if you're hanging out with a friend, you're not just thinking, right? That's something.

, Whether you're writing on paper or a computer, you should first define a problem, write down your options, and then list the pros and cons for each option. Seeing your thoughts in front of you will also help you stop cycling through them in your head. Once you can't think of anything more to write, your mind has done its job, and it's time to stop thinking.


If making a list still doesn't help you make a decision, don't be afraid to follow your intuition. If two or more options seem equally appealing, thinking more will not make things clearer. This is when you should listen to something deeper.

, Instead of lingering over your most persistent thoughts, jot down all of the things on your mind every day. At the end of one week, go over what you've written and make a note of the things that are troubling you the most. You need to deal with those first.


Try to write in your diary at least a few times a week. This will help you get used to the idea of a ""thinking time"" and will help you sit down with your thoughts, instead of having them trouble you throughout the day.

, Make a list of all the things you have to do on a certain day. Unless ""brooding"" is on your list of priorities, this will force you to see that you have more important things to do than to sit around pondering the meaning of the universe! The quickest way to organize your thoughts is to put them into something actionable. If you're thinking that you haven't gotten enough sleep lately, make a plan for getting some Z's pronto instead of worrying about it!


The list can be practical and can deal with the bigger things, like: ""spend more time with my family.""

, This may sound crazy, but picking a time every day for yourself to worry, wonder, be dreamy, and to get lost in your thoughts can help you control your thoughts in a more productive manner. If you need to, give yourself an hour, say, from 5-6:00 every day. Then, try to get the time down to 5-5:30. If an upsetting thought comes up earlier in the day when it's inconvenient to deal with it, just tell yourself, ""I'll worry about that at 5 pm.""


This may sound ridiculous, but you've got to try it before you knock it.

, If your problem is that you think too much about nothing, worry for no reason, or think about things you can't control, then there's not much you can do to ""solve"" the problems that are plaguing your thoughts. But think of the ones you can solve and make an active plan for going about doing so, instead of thinking, thinking, thinking without it going anywhere. Here are some ideas for what you can do:


Instead of thinking about whether or not your crush likes you, take action! Ask him or her out. What's the worst that can happen?
If you're worried that you're falling behind in work or school, make a list of all of the things you can do to succeed. And then do those things!
If you like to think, ""What if..."" a lot, try to do the things that are feasible.

, Surrounding yourself with people you love will keep you talking more and thinking less. Make sure to get out of the house at least a few times a week, and make a point of working to develop lasting and meaningful relationships with at least two or three people in your area that you can hang out with. You'll be much more prone to thinking if you spend a lot of time by yourself.


Alone time is definitely a good thing, but it's important to mix up your routine with some time to hang out with your friends, let loose, and have fun.

, Take the time to explore something completely different and out of your comfort zone. A new hobby, no matter what it is, will keep you focused on the task at hand as well as interested in getting results. Don't think that you already know what you like and don't need any more distractions. Trying a new hobby can help you live in the moment and focus on your art, your craft, or whatever. Try some of these:



Write a poem or a short story

Take a night class in history
Take a pottery or ceramics class
Learn karate
Take up surfing
Try biking instead of driving


, There are a number of ways to dance — alone in your room, out at a club with your friends, or even by taking a dance class such as tap, jazz, foxtrot, or swing dancing. Whatever form of dance you encounter, you'll be able to move your body, listen to the lyrics, and live in the moment. It doesn't matter if you're a terrible dancer. In fact, that you would get you even more focused on your dance moves and less focused on all of your niggling thoughts.


Taking up a dance class would be a great way to start a new hobby and to dance.

, Get outside and start looking at the trees, smelling the roses, and feeling fresh water on your face. That will help you live in the moment, embrace nature and the impermanence of your existence, and to see a world outside of the one you created inside your own head. Put on your sunblock and your sneakers and stop being cooped up in your bedroom.


Even if you're not into hiking, running, biking, or surfing, make a goal of walking through a park at least once or twice a week, taking a weekend trip to something nature-related with your friends during your next vacation, or just going somewhere were you can stare out at a big blue lake or ocean.
And if that seems like too much work for you, just go outside. Being out in the sun will make you happier, healthier, and less likely to brood.

, Focusing on the thoughts of other people will not only give you insight, but will keep you from thinking about yourself too much. In fact, reading biographies of inspirational men and women ""of action"" may inspire you to see that behind every great thought, there is an equally great action. And reading books can also not make you want to do anything except for escape to a new world for a while, which is also nice.

, Every day, make a list of at least five things you are grateful for. This will make you focus on people and things instead of thoughts. If every day is too much, try doing it every week. Mix it up. Every little thing counts, even the barista who gives you a free refill of your coffee.

, Listening to a great song can make you feel in touch with the world outside your own head. You can do this by going to a concert, playing an old CD in your car, or even getting a record player and some LPs and going old school. Close your eyes, soak in the notes, and live in the now.


It doesn't have to be Mozart or something meaningful or hoity-toity. Listening to Katy Perry can do the trick too!

, Be around people who make you laugh. Go to a comedy club. Watch a comedy or a TV show with a funny cast that you really like. Watch some funny YouTube videos. Do whatever you have to do to make yourself crack up, toss your head back, and not care about all of the things that are on your mind. Don't underestimate the importance the role of laughter plays in your mental health.

Practice yoga.,
Drink lots of water.,
Eat foods that promote relaxation.,
Exercise moderately.,
Participate in your favorite activities.,
Drink warm liquids.",How to Relax Your Mind2," Yoga is a type of stretching and low-impact exercise which helps to relax the muscles in your body. Because you must focus on each yoga pose, your mind is left no room to contemplate stressors and is forced into a state of peace.


It is best to start yoga by taking a class. Yoga classes are made to create a state of relaxation, even though there may be many people present. Look for local instructors or classes at nearby gyms.
Hatha yoga is the most basic style of yoga and is great for relaxation. Look for hatha yoga poses that you can try yourself at home.
Avoid doing yoga if you have physical problems such as a herniated disc, osteoporosis, or you are at risk for blood clots., Water is important for keeping your body well hydrated and free of toxins, which helps your mind to focus better. To aid in other relaxation exercises, drink plenty of water.

, Certain foods help to lower hormones linked to causing anxiety while simultaneously raising hormones which are responsible for creating a sense of happiness and peace.


Foods high in selenium aid in lowering anxiety and depression, and include nuts (especially Brazil nuts), shiitake mushrooms, and tuna, cod, or salmon.
Eat foods that have a high magnesium content, such as spinach, pumpkin seeds, and halibut.
Look for foods with high tryptophan content, as this helps produce the chemical serotonin which increases happiness. Try dark chocolate, nuts, and red meat.

, Exercise is responsible for releasing endorphins, which in turn create a feeling of happiness. Try doing a little exercise every day to help relax your mind after dealing with a stress-filled schedule.


Exercise in places that are quiet or allow time for you to be alone. If you workout at your gym, find an area or room that is mostly deserted, so that you aren’t distracted by thoughts of things around you.
Try to find mindless repetitive exercises to participate in. This might include swimming or running laps.

, If you love to cook, read, or play sports, do those things! Doing things you love will help you to clear your mind of anxiety, and will likely release more endorphins which cause happiness.

, Hot drinks help to relieve tension and reduce stress. Look for hot drinks that lack caffeine and alcohol, as these can stimulate anxiety and depression.


Green tea contains certain natural chemicals linked to reduced stress levels. Drink it hot or iced to get the peaceful benefits it provides.
Try drinking warm milk. This classic bed-time drink can help to soothe your troubled mind as it contains high levels of tryptophan, responsible for producing more serotonin in your brain. Warm milk in a saucepan with honey for a sweet relaxing treat.
If you choose to drink coffee to help you relax, find a decaffeinated version so as to not stimulate hyperactivity.
Avoid drinking anything with too much sugar, as this will stimulate your brain and make relaxing much more difficult."
"
Occupy yourself in a repetitive, mindless activity.,
Listen to calming music.,
Spend time with animals.,
Try aromatherapy.,
Soak in a bath or pool.",How to Relax Your Mind3," Doing something that requires work but no focus can help your mind to relax.


Try doodling or drawing an abstract image. You are forced to focus on the act of drawing and are therefore unable to think about stressors in your life.
Performing chores that use repetitive movements can induce relaxation. Think of raking leaves, sweeping the floor, or folding laundry.
If you know how you can also do things like weaving bracelets or knitting.
Avoid things that require a lot of movement or that are very busy, as this can induce stress rather than reduce it.

, Although you may love rocking out to hardcore rock or rap, find some slow, soothing tunes to help relax your mind.


Avoid music that has heavy instruments or loud vocals, as these, will make it hard for you to relax while listening. Sometimes it's better to not have words in it at all.
Instead of music, you can also listen to nature sounds and white noise which are developed to help people relax. Look for sounds of the ocean or forest, or find samples of white noise to try.
Binaural beats are a special type of music or sound that produce higher levels of alpha waves in your brain, which help you to relax. Find free versions of binaural beats online or through your favorite music streaming site.Try listening to some music that has a lot of repetition in it and not that much vocal. Many genres of electronic music have this style such as house, trance, trap, and trip-hop.

, Studies show that people who spend time with pets or touching animals have lowered blood pressure and are significantly less stressed than people who rarely come in contact with animals.


If you don’t have your own pet, consider borrowing your friend’s dog to take for a walk or cuddling up with your neighbors cat. A little animal time a day can go a long way.
Look into animal assisted psychotherapy. This is a type of therapy that helps to reduce stress and anxiety by using animals. Often times horses are used, but dogs and cats are also popular options., This is when you use soothing scents to help you relax. Many popular aromatherapy smells include lavender, peppermint, and eucalyptus.


You can purchase aromatherapy oils to place directly on your skin. Dab a little around your temples and the inside of your wrists and elbows. These are some of the warmest places on your body, and will work to diffuse the scent faster.
Aromatherapy mists and home fragrances can be used to make your bedroom your own personal relaxation sanctuary. Find them in mists and candles to help your home smell peaceful.

, Warm water can help to release endorphins that reduce stress, so take a hot bubble bath for twenty minutes.

Stay away from social media outlets.,
Don’t watch television.,
Spend time alone.,
Avoid your known stressors.",How to Relax Your Mind4," A huge cause of stress is any social media, whether it be your phone or facebook account. Try to spend some time away from these things to help reduce your anxiety.


Turn off your phone or leave it in your car for a bit so that you don’t run the temptation of obsessively checking it every few minutes.
Leave your laptop closed and turn off your desktop so that you are not tempted to check your online media accounts.
If social media is a big enough stressor in your life, consider removing it entirely for a period. Deactivate your online social accounts for a few weeks or months until you feel that it will no longer cause a problem for you.

, TV is full of bright colors, busy images, and constant noise which help to raise stress levels.

, Often the people around us cause us the most anxiety, so make it a point to spend some time with just yourself.


Take time off work to catch up on rest and alone time. Try taking a weekend retreat to a local town or nature reserve where you can have some time to think.
Cancel plans with friends if you overwhelm yourself with a too-packed schedule. It is important to have time with just yourself before sharing it with others.
Find time away from your family. It doesn’t matter how much you love them, everybody needs a bit of time separate from their family in order to keep a healthy mindset.

, If you know that an upcoming test or meeting is what is causing your stress, try to spend time away from it to prevent additional anxiety.


Set firm boundaries for times in which you are willing to deal with these stressors, if they are work or school related. Promise yourself only to work on your homework until 8pm, after which you will spend time debriefing and letting go of stress.
If a certain person or activity is responsible for your anxiety, avoid them for a bit. Spend time thinking about why that thing, in particular, bothers you so much, and a solution to the problem."

Get up from your desk.,
Take a walk outside.,
Pick something new to do.,
Don't forget to eat.",How to Cheer Up on Your Lunch Break2," One way to help cheer yourself up at lunch is to make sure you leave your desk. If you stay at your desk, you'll likely just stay in whatever funk you're in. Getting up and away can help break up the mood you're in., Seeing green can put you in a better mood, so spend some time outside looking at nature. Plus, getting out in the sunlight is also a natural mood booster, so be sure to spend at least ten minutes feeding your skin with vitamin D from the sun.

, Break out of your everyday lunch routine. Maybe you sit in your office most days or go eat in the break room. Try doing something new. Visit a restaurant you've been meaning to try, for instance, or visit a new park. Just trying something new and exciting can perk you up., It can be tempting to skip over eating if you're in a bad mood. However, that will likely drag you down even more, as your blood sugar crashes in the afternoon. Eat a solid, healthy meal to perk you up for the afternoon.Try including a lean protein, some whole grains, and a fruit or veggie.
Of course, eating some you enjoy can also boost your mood, so if you are really craving it, go for that ice cream at the end.

Make yourself laugh.",How to Cheer Up on Your Lunch Break3," Nothing cheers you up like a good laugh with friends. If you're feeling down, call up a friend and invite them to lunch. If you need to talk, they can listen, or you can just laugh and enjoy each other's company. Either way, you're sure to feel better after spending time with a friend.Don't forget to hug one of your friends while you're out, as that can also help boost your mood., If reading is something you enjoy, reading on your lunch break can cheer you up immensely, as long as you're reading a book you enjoy. It helps you escape you're everyday life for a bit, letting you live in someone else's world., Another way to cheer yourself up is to practice some retail therapy, if you like to go shopping.

Lion pose is not a particularly strenuous pose, but you may choose to incorporate it into a larger yoga practice., Wear clothing that allows you to move freely and will not distract you.

, Yoga is about meditation as well as physical exercise, so try to find a place free of distractions for your practice.

, You will need a soft surface to perform this pose because you will be kneeling. If you do not have a yoga mat, you can also perform lion pose on another soft surface, such as a blanket, towel, or rug.

, Your knees should be a comfortable distance apart and your hands should be at your side.

, Place your palms on the ground, with your fingers facing away from you, about 6 inches (15.2 cm) away from your knees. Spread your fingers wide and press them firmly into the floor.

, Prepare for the full extension of the pose by inhaling through your nose. As you exhale, open your mouth wide, constrict the muscles in your throat, and let out an audible sigh. Stretch your tongue out and down as far as possible.Be sure to engage the muscles in your arms by continuing to push your fingers into the floor as you roar. An alternative is to keep your hands by your side and then thrust them in front of you quickly as you roar., As you roar, open your eyes wide while gazing up towards your eyebrows or the tip of your nose., Hold the pose for as long as it feels comfortable. Relax your body as you inhale through your nose, and then repeat the pose on your next exhale. You can repeat the pose as many times as you like.

, One variation of lion pose is to cross one ankle over the other. If you try this modification, be sure to switch the cross of your legs and perform the pose the same number of times on each side., To add a hip opener to the pose, try incorporating Mandukasana (frog pose) into your lion pose. Before extending your arms forward, reposition your legs so that your big toes are touching, but your knees are spread at least as wide as your outer hips. Then perform the rest of the pose as usual. Some people combine this modified leg position with a modified arm position. Try placing your palms on the floor in front of you with your fingers facing towards you. Keep your hands a few inches from your body, and then lean forward slightly., If you would rather not lean forward, the muscles in your face and throat can still benefit from lion pose. Simply kneel on your mat and place your hands palm down on your knees instead of extending them in front of you. Then perform the rest of the pose as usual, being careful to keep your back straight.Even though your arms are not extended, keep pressing your hands down with your fingers splayed.

, Sometimes it is simply not comfortable to kneel. If you have sensitive knees, you may want to sit in a different position. You can sit in a cross-legged position, or, if you are more advanced, you can Do the Lotus Position. Choose a seating position that is comfortable for you, and then perform the rest of the pose as usual.Another great option for yogis with sensitive knees is to double the yoga mat over or kneel on a blanket for extra padding.

, Instead of roaring, experiment with laughing on your exhale. It may help you reduce stress."

Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose.,
Let your stomach expand.,
Exhale fully.,
Try breathing deeply five times in a row.,
Perform this technique anytime, anywhere.",How to Breathe Deeply1," Let the air completely fill your lungs. Resist the urge to exhale quickly before you've fully inhaled. It definitely takes some practice, since most of us are in the habit of taking quick, shallow breaths instead of long, deep ones. Focus on breathing in as much as you can through your nose, which has tiny hairs that filter out dust and toxins so they can't reach your lungs.As we go about our days, we often breathe in a quick, shallow way without being conscious we are doing so. Daily stresses distract us from being aware or mindful of the way we are breathing.
Deep breathing will help you be more mindful of your body. Feel the air enter your lungs and fill them up. When you're concentrating on taking a deep breath, your worries are pushed aside for the time being.;
, As you draw in a deep breath, let your stomach expand by an inch or two. The air should travel all the way to your diaphragm, causing your belly to round out as it fills. If you watch a baby sleep, you see that babies belly-breathe naturally. Their stomachs, not their chests, rise and fall with each breath.As adults, we get conditioned to take shallow breaths instead of belly breaths. When we hold in our emotions, we tend to suck in our stomachs, tensing up rather than relaxing when we breathe. When you learn how to breathe properly, this tension goes away.


Lay down, stand, or sit upright as you breathe. It's more difficult to draw in a full breath if you're in a slouched position.
Place one hand on your belly, and the other on your chest, as you inhale. You can tell you're breathing deeply and properly if the hand on your belly rises out further than the one on your chest as you inhale.

, Let out your breath slowly through your nose. As you breath out, pull in your belly toward your spine. Exhale all of the breath in your lungs. After you exhale, take in another deep breath through your nose and continue breathing deeply. Try to exhale for twice as long as you inhale, and fully expel the air. , Inhaling and exhaling counts as 1 time. This immediately calms you down by slowing your heart rate and blood pressure, as well as distracting your mind from stressful thoughts. Get in a comfortable position and practice deep breathing correctly 5 times in a row.


Remember that your stomach should expand an inch or so from your body, further than your chest expands.
Once you get the hang of deep breathing, try doing it 10 or 20 times in a row. Notice how your body begins to feel as you flood it with oxygen.

, Now that you know how to breathe deeply, use the technique as an immediate stress reducer when feeling uptight or worried. You can perform this deep breathing privately in quiet place. You can just as easily take five deep breaths while sitting at your desk, riding the subway or even talking on the phone. Use this tool to calm yourself down when and where you need to.


Each time you notice yourself taking short, shallow breaths, switch to deep ones. You'll immediately start feeling less frenzied and more in control.
The more you practice deep breathing, the more natural it will feel. After all, as a baby you breathed deeply with each breath you took.

Count to four as you inhale slowly.,
Hold your breath for seven seconds.,
Exhale for eight seconds.,
Repeat four a total of four breaths.",How to Breathe Deeply2," As you take in air through your nose, count from one to four, making sure not to rush. This counting exercise will help you regulate your breaths and concentrate on breathing deeply. Remember to let your belly move outward and breathe from your diaphragm.This breathing exercise acts as a kind of sedative. Whenever you're feeling particularly stressed out or in need a quick way to calm down, find a quiet place to practice 4-7-8 breathing.
You can also use this breathing exercise to help you fall asleep.

, Relax and hold it, not breathing in or out, as you wait for seven seconds. You can count in your head or use a watch.

, Slowly let the air out through your mouth as you count to eight. Timing your exhale will help you make sure that it's about twice as long as your inhale, which is optimal for deep breathing. As you exhale, pull your stomach in to help expel as much air as you can.

, Breathe in again, hold it, and exhale completely. Remember to count every time so that the 4-7-8 ratio always stays the same. After four breaths, you should feel a sense of calm. Repeat the exercise for several more breaths if needed.

Sit in an upright position.,
Start by taking several deep, full breaths.,
Breath in and out of your nose quickly for 15 seconds.,
Do another round of 20 breaths.,
Do a third round of 30 breaths.,
Rest for a moment and move on with your day.",How to Breathe Deeply3," Sit in a straight-backed chair, and hold your spine erect. This is the correct starting position for a breathing exercise called the Bellows technique, a combination of deep breathing and rapid breathing. Since it is meant to help you get energized, so it's better to do it sitting than lying down., Inhale slowly and fully, then exhale slowly and fully. Repeat at least four times, so that you're completely relaxed.

, Keep your mouth closed and breath in and out of your nose as fast as you can, taking quick but deep breaths. The breaths should still be diaphragm breaths, but you want to breathe in and out as fast as you can.


It might help to put your hand on your stomach to make sure it's rising and falling as you breathe. It can be easy to do the bellows exercise without engaging your diaphragm as much as you should.
Keep your head, neck, and shoulders still as your belly moves in and out.

, After a short break, use the exact same technique to take 20 breaths. Breathe in and out through your nose, making sure you're taking breaths from your diaphragm.

, This is the last set of breaths. Breathe in and out through your nose, making sure you're taking breaths from your diaphragm.

, You should feel fully energized and ready to perform at a high level for the rest of the day. Since the bellows technique is so energizing, it's best not to do it before going to bed at night.


If you feel lightheaded or dizzy during the process of trying this technique, stop immediately. If you want to try again later, do fewer breaths and work your way up to a complete round of bellows.
Pregnant women, people with panic disorder, and people who experience seizures should not perform this exercise.

Growing your marijuana inside will allow you to completely control the environment. This will eliminate the possibility of overwatering (through rain), lack of sun, pest problems, and other issues that plague outdoor growers. But don’t worry, you don’t need a specifically designed space to grow pot. With a little retrofitting you can essentially grow your pot in any indoor space.;
, Perhaps the most important step in creating an environment to grow quality medical marijuana is to purchase and set up your lights. Quality lights and a good lighting schedule will make sure that your marijuana will grow and produce quality buds. In addition, you’re going to want to light-proof your grow room so light will not leak in during the night-time or dark period. Make sure to:


Purchase either metal halide or high pressure sodium lights. The typical rule is that you should have 7000-7500 lumens per square foot in a grow room. The number of lumens vary based on the light, so consult the box or manufacturer before purchasing.
Install surge protectors and use GFI wall outlets to protect against the potential of electrocution if there is a flood in the grow room.
Consider buying a generator to provide backup power in case of a power outage.
Lightproof your grow room by covering all windows with tinfoil, heavy-duty blackout curtains, and more. Also make sure no light can travel underneath the door leading out of the room., A lighting schedule is extremely important to growing quality medical marijuana. Because you want quality pot, you’ll be completely regulating your plant's light source. You need to be diligent about this schedule, and do not stray from it. Straying from your lighting schedule may undermine the quality of your buds.


Purchase timers so you can put your lights on a schedule.
Your initial lighting schedule will be 18 hours of light and 6 hours of dark.
Do not enter the room during the dark period – this could trigger flowering.
Do not let any light at all enter the room during the dark period., Plants, just like animals, need fresh and clean air to thrive. As a result, you need to make sure that wherever you grow your plants has fresh and clean air. In addition, you need to make sure that the temperature and relative humidity of your grow space stays relatively constant. To do this:


Make sure your grow room has good circulation to move fresh air in and out. You can do this by installing specially designed ducts that will move air in and out without allowing sunlight to creep through. The cheapest way to do this would be to install bent pipes in a window opening, and covering the left-over space with plywood and/or other materials. Use fans to further promote circulation.
Make sure your heating and cooling system is running and is capable of providing cool and hot air to the space. Depending on where you are, air conditioning might be the most important since your lights will generate a lot of heat.
Make sure your temperature stays a constant 70 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit. The specific number in that range depends on the strain of marijuana and your climate. Many growers like to keep the temperature between 72 and 75 degrees when lights are on, and allow the temperature to climb to 79 to 85 during the dark period., Soil, next to lighting, is perhaps the most important element in growing quality medical marijuana. Make sure to secure a really good soil mix. Don’t cheap out here. Soil quality and the nutrients in soil will determine the quality of your product. Consider:


Your soil should drain well so that you don’t have water accumulation that could hurt your roots and plant. Soils should have some sand, sponge rock, or pearlite in it.
Have a mixture of fox farm ocean forest soil and half of any kinds of unfertilized potting soil. This mixture will do the trick and this will help enable the root of the plant to access to the food (nutrient) freely.
Include good fertilizer in the soil. The type of fertilizer you choose can vary depending on your taste and budget., The first step in growing your marijuana will be to plant your seeds. While this is a pretty foolproof process (if you’ve done everything else right), there are a number of things you need to do to make sure your seeds germinate and grow. Make sure to:


Bury your seeds less than an inch from the surface.
Provide water to the seeds after burying. Do not flood the soil. Just make sure it is wet several inches down.
Plant extra seeds to account for seeds that don’t germinate or seedlings that die soon after germinating., Be sure to water your marijuana plants as often as they need to be watered. If you don’t water your plants enough, photosynthesis may slow, your plants will develop slower, and your quality will suffer. If you water them too much, your plants could suffer root rot or other problems that will hurt quality. To water properly, make sure to:


Wait until the top of your soil is dry to about an inch deep.
Water your plants until 10% to 20% of the water drains out of the bottom of your growing container.
Wait until the top of your soil is dry to an inch again before watering.
After some experience, feel free to set up an automatic watering system that works on a timer. This will save an experienced grower a lot of time., The second growth phase after germinating your seeds is the vegetative state. The vegetative state is a period from 2 weeks to 2 months depending on the variety of the plant. During this period your plants will develop and mature.


Most strains need a minimum of 2-3 weeks in the vegetative state. However, you can choose how big you want your plants to be by how long you allow them to stay in a vegetative state.
Make sure to give your plant enough water, depending on size of the plant, pot, and other conditions.
Make sure to give your plant enough fertilizer, if it’s not already present in the soil., Once your plants have been in the vegetative state and are as large as you want them to be, you need to induce flowering. This is the major change in the lifestyle of your plants from when they will be growing to maturity to when they will begin to produce flowers and buds. To induce flowering:


Reduce your light from 18 hours a day to 12 hours a day.
Do not let any light enter the room during the 12 dark hours.
In about two weeks, you’ll begin to see bud and flower development on the plants. This will begin the flowering stage.
Continue your 12 hours of darkness until harvesting., The pH of your plant is extremely important in making sure you are growing quality medical marijuana. This is because marijuana does not really thrive in soil that is too acidic. As a result, you should monitor the pH of your soil often to make sure the acidity is not too high.


Test the pH every 2 to 3 days. If you are going soil-less (hydroponic) make sure to test your pH every day.
Your target pH is between 6.0 and 7.0 if using traditional soil.
Your target pH is between 5.5. and 6.5 if you are going hydroponic another soil-less method.
Use a digital pH pen or pH testing strips., After you’ve tested your pH level and determined that it needs to be adjusted, you can take measurements to properly tune the pH. By adjusting the pH, you’ll help create the best environment to grow quality marijuana. To adjust pH:


Purchase pH UP and pH Down solution.
Test your water’s pH level.
Follow directions on the solution’s container and add enough solution to the water until you get the desired pH.
Use the treated water to water your plants and retest after a few days.
Continue adding solution for as long as needed, or indefinitely if your water is out of the desired pH range., As the flowering stage comes to an end and your flowers/buds are maturing, you’ll need to prepare yourself to flush your plants. Flushing is the process in which you stop adding nutrients and fertilizer to the plants and only provide your plants with an excess of pure water. What this will do is make sure that nutrients are flushed out of the soil and/or other medium you are growing in. This will force your plant to rely on nutrient reserves. This will increase the quality of the final product.


Start the flushing process 2 weeks before harvest.
Do not add any more fertilizer or nutrients for the remainder of the plant’s life.
Add enough water so that there is water at the top of the soil. Let it leech or bleed out of the bottom of the container.
Repeat this step a second time after all of the water bleeds out of the bottom of the container.
If you are growing hydroponic, make sure to swap the old water out for fresh water., Two days before harvest, you’ll want to take a few steps to make sure the harvest process will be done perfectly. This will ensure the production of quality marijuana. Make sure to:


Conduct another flush two days before harvest. Make sure to do this twice.
Stop adding water one day before harvest.
Adjust this process (in future crops) and try to make sure your soil is completely dry before harvest., Once your plants have budded and the buds have flowered, it will be time to harvest. Harvesting is a very committed and prolonged process, so make sure you have the time to do this and the space to do what needs to be done. Begin by:


Cutting the plant from the root.
Cutting larger branches to make it easier, if you need.
Making sure you leave at least two large branches.
Removing all leaves. This should be relatively easy because they would have started to die a week or two before.
Removing all excess twigs, stems, leaves, and anything without buds., After harvesting your plants, you’ll need to begin the curing process. The curing process is extremely important and needs to be done right. If you don’t cure properly, your buds could develop mold, mildew, or just dry out completely. Make sure to:


Hang your large branches and the plant for 1 to 2 weeks. Remove smaller buds as they dry out. Remember, you don’t want them completely dry, but maybe half-dry.
The temperature of the room you cure in should be about 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
The humidity of the room you cure in should be about 50 percent.
After you’ve removed the buds from the branches, make sure to put them in an airtight container. Open the container several times a day to allow fresh air in. Always reseal the container afterwards.
After a few days, your buds will be ready., Before you embark upon growing quality medical marijuana, you need to know the specifics of the laws governing medical marijuana growth and consumption in your city or state. Laws vary from state to state and city to city – know them.


Find out if you can indeed grow marijuana at the location you want to grow it. Some jurisdictions forbid growing marijuana close to a school or other public buildings. Make sure your location is zoned and is okay to grow pot at.
Know how many plants you are permitted to grow as a medical marijuana grower. These numbers vary from state to state and city to city. You can be fined or imprisoned if you grow too much.
Contact your local government, police department, or alcohol and marijuana control authority if you have any questions.

, Find out if you need a permit or license to grow marijuana. If you do, get your permit or license before moving forward. Growing without a permit may result in substantial fines or jail time., Before you grow medical marijuana, know how federal law applies to medical marijuana. While medical marijuana growth and consumption might be permitted in your city or state, federal law may contradict it and is a higher authority.


Consumption of marijuana for medical purposes is actually prohibited by federal law.
Growth of medical marijuana is also prohibited by federal law.
While it does not happen often, the Justice Department can prosecute you for cultivating or consuming medical marijuana., After you’ve familiarized yourself with your local and state laws, you need to understand laws and rules about distribution of medical marijuana in your jurisdiction and at the federal level.


You may be prosecuted for distributing your medical marijuana to others, even if they have a prescription.
Many states and cities require that people purchasing medical marijuana must do so with a doctor's prescription and buy it from a licensed distributor.
While the federal government may look the other way most of the time when it comes to medical marijuana for personal use, you are much more likely to be prosecuted if you distribute your medical marijuana to others. The danger of prosecution is especially high if you or someone else brings your marijuana across state borders."

There are a wide variety of reasons one would choose a ketogenic diet, from its various health benefits, such as being linked to reducing epilepsy, various neurological disorders, or treating certain types of diabetes, to losing weight or gaining mass in the gym. Consulting your physician will help you understand what and how your body might go through once your diet has changed, and will help keep you in informed on healthy states throughout the entire process of ketosis.Discuss the possibility of potential complications with your doctor if you have preexisting health conditions or metabolic disorders.
Ask your doctor if a ketogenic diet might help treat existing health conditions or preemptively treat conditions you might be prone to, like diabetes.;
, Ketogenic diets, although nutritionally sound, are metabolically similar to starvation. If you are transitioning from a low-fat high-carb diet you may experience some side effects (generally called the “keto flu”) during the first few weeks of ketosis. Trying a low-carb diet before transitioning into a ketogenic diet will reduce the amount of side-effects as well as introduce you to the types of food you will be eating.


If you experience symptoms of the keto flu, like nausea, intestinal discomfort, or sleep issues, revert a standard low carb diet for a few days before returning to a ketogenic one.Ketosis and ketogenic diets are popular among fitness and “paleo” communities. Join a community online or at your gym to have access to long term informational resources before committing to a ketogenic diet.

, Ketoacidosis is a combination of an overproduction of ketones and and underproduction of insulin. Insulin regulates the amount of fat converted into energy when you are in ketosis. The average individual will produce enough insulin while in ketosis to keep their ketones in a healthy range. Although an unlikely state if you do not have type 1 diabetes, ketoacidosis can quickly become severe and cause symptoms like swelling, dehydration, and inflammation.Check with your physician or doctor to see if you are prone to an insulin deficiency.

, Some variants allow for moderation while others can be more restrictive. There are different variants of ketogenic diets, the more you understand about the various diet options the easier it will be to manage expectations or concerns, control your diet, and achieve your desired results.


The standard ketogenic diet, which is the diet given to most ketosis study participants, is made up of 75% fat, 20% protein, and 5% carbs.Cyclical and targeted ketogenic diets allow you to add carbs two days per week or around workouts.The high-protein ketogenic diet is similar to the standard diet, but with slightly more protein and less fat. The proportions are 60% fat, 35% protein, and 5% carbs., Testing for your body’s production of ketones is a surefire way of knowing whether or not your ketogenic diet is effective. You’ll eliminate many of the ketone bodies produced by converting fat in your liver through your urine throughout the process of ketosis. Testing throughout your diet will also help you keep an eye on the balance of ketones your body is producing and will warn you of any signs that you are slipping into ketoacidosis.Buy ketosis test strips, like ketostix, and use them regularly and consistently.When producing ketones your urine and breath might begin to smell fruity or like nail polish remover., Since you are trying to train your body to burn fat instead of glucose, often found in carbohydrates, for energy, fat is the primary ingredient in a ketogenic diet. Making sure you are cooking with fat, eating high fat snacks, and incorporating fat as a major part of every meal will help you maintain ketosis.Try cooking high fat meats, like salmon or beef, in high fat oils, like olive, coconut, or avocado oil.Make high fat snacks for yourself throughout the day, like nuts, avocados, or unprocessed cheese., Proteins will be giving you the much needed energy and substance throughout the process of ketosis. Depending on what your desired effects are for starting the ketogenic diet you may be eating more or less protein throughout your diet.Eat protein with every meal, like eggs with breakfast, fish with lunch, and red meat or chicken with dinner.
If you are using a ketogenic diet to lose weight or build muscle mass, eat approximately 1g of protein per pound of body mass., Net carbohydrates are the amount of carbohydrates you ingest with the amount of fiber subtracted. Calculating net carbs will give you a better idea of how many carbs you are eating a day to keep you within a healthy range.If, for example, you eat a serving of broccoli with 7g of carbs and 2g of fiber, the net carbohydrates would be 5g.
Try to eat carbohydrates that are high in fiber to reduce your carb intake and aid digestion.

, Carbs and sugars contain many forms of glucose that are counterproductive to a ketogenic diet. Avoiding starchy vegetables, refined sugars, and fruits will help you keep your carbohydrate intake down and keep your body producing ketones.Avoid wheat-based products (pasta, flour, bread), sodas, fruits, and candy.Rice, beans, and other complex carbohydrates are also to be avoided.Alcohol is another source of carbohydrates and should not be consumed while on a ketogenic diet.

, Short chain fats signal the liver to make more ketones and can also be a source of fiber. Although many short chain fats also contain other forms of carbohydrates there are many foods that can ease the the process of ketosis and reduce the stress on your body.Try to cook as many meals as you can with Coconut oil.Try and eat vegetables like onions, asparagus, artichokes, and garlic as often as you can., Vitamin D is rarely naturally present in foods, however, it is an essential to calcium consumption, cell growth, and inflammation. The restriction of a ketogenic diet can also demand a higher need for vitamin d. Supplementing your diet with vitamin D will also help prevent bone density loss.Purchase vitamin D capsules or pill at your local health food store.
You can also get vitamin D sun exposure. Try to sit outside or go for a walk each day., Eliminating carbohydrates also means eliminating a large source of fiber. Fiber reduces the stress of digestion and promotes healthy bowel movements. If you are having difficulty consuming your desired amount of fiber try taking a supplement like Metamucil to prevent constipation or other intestinal inflammations.

Make changes to your diet slowly.,
Stick to a predetermined schedule to stay consistent.,
Choose dairy alternatives to help your diet seem less restrictive.,
Check out milk alternatives.,
Buy hard or soft vegan cheeses.,
Avoid cooking your food with dairy.,
Look out for foods that have hidden dairy ingredients.,
Substitute other sweeteners for your dairy sweeteners.,
Get enough calcium in your diet.,
Maintain an adequate intake of riboflavin.,
Make sure you get enough Vitamin D. Vitamin D is an important vitamin that your body needs to properly absorb calcium and keep bones strong.,
Don't forget protein in your diet.,
Maintain a balanced diet.",How to Go Dairy Free and Stay Healthy," Start by making small changes to your diet, removing dairy slowly and over time. By making small changes that you can live with, you will find it easier to sustain this new diet that you are implementing.By gradually decreasing your consumption of dairy products, cravings may not be as intense.
If you are already aware of the dairy products you currently consume, remove the dairy products that you can live without.
Retain the dairy foods you love at first. Allowing yourself some dairy during the process will make success more likely.
When you get used to eating less dairy, try removing a few more dairy products until all the dairy products in your diet are removed.;
, To help yourself make the transition to a dairy-free diet, try making a diet plan in advance and then following it. Keeping track of your diet and sticking to your diet plan have been shown to help when starting a new diet. Here are more examples of starting your diet shift slowly:

On the first week, replace dairy milk with soy milk or another alternative.
On the second week, replace dairy cheese with non-dairy cheese or nutritional yeast.
Every following week, try removing one more type of dairy food in your diet.
Keep a food diary to maintain and keep track of your progress

, Sometimes cravings for old flavors lead people to go back to dairy products. The best way to avoid this is by finding good alternatives to the usual dairy products you consume.

Eating dairy product alternatives can seem unusual at first, but with time you will come to see them as a natural part of your diet.
Some dairy substitutes can be more healthy than the dairy product themselves.

, If you find yourself craving milk, you can purchase various milk alternatives to replace regular dairy milk. These alternatives are a great way to still enjoy a “milk” product without the actual dairy content.Soy milk is derived from soy beans. Soy milk is low in cholesterol, and a great source for vitamin D, riboflavin, vitamin B12 and calcium.Rice milks are generally made from brown rice. They have very low levels of saturated fat and cholesterol. Rice milks also contain vitamin C, calcium, and iron, although not in high levels., Dairy-free cheese is a great way to still enjoy many of the qualities of cheese without actually consuming any dairy in your diet. Some vegan cheeses may be more or less like actual, dairy based cheese, so try a few different types to see which you prefer.Redwood cheese is a dairy free cheese, free from animal ingredients. It is recommended for melting.
Bute Island cheese is another dairy-free alternative to cheese, which is available in a variety of flavors.
Dr. Cow has vegan cheeses that are made out of nuts, instead of dairy, and come in many flavors.

, Instead of utilizing dairy products during cooking, opt for alternative ingredients. There are many creative and great tasting alternatives that you can cook with to keep your meals interesting.Instead of making an alfredo sauce with cream and butter, there are recipes that use puréed cauliflower or nuts.
Try using frozen bananas instead of milk in your shakes.
Avoiding dairy in these recipes will not only help you adhere to a dairy-free diet, but will also make sure that you lower your intake of “bad” types of fat.

, Although you probably know many of the foods in your diet that contain dairy, many foods may not be readily apparent. Pay careful attention to food labels and do some research to learn which foods may have dairy as an ingredient.Some obvious dairy products that contain lactose are butter, candy, cheese, cream, curds, milk and milk based foods, ice cream, white sauce and yogurt.
Many breads are made using dairy.
Chocolates, chip dips, mustards, mayo and other condiments may contain dairy.
Before eating canned products or packaged products, it is best to check the labels to see if the product contains lactose.

, Try dairy free sweeteners, such as jellies, jams, honey, sugar, molasses and frozen or pureed fruit bars.

Be aware that honey is considered an animal product and may not be suitable for you if you are considering a vegan diet.

, Calcium is used by the body to maintain bone health. Most dairy foods contain calcium, and the main deficiency that can occur in a dairy-free diet is a lack of calcium. Make sure you are still eating enough calcium rich foods to stay healthy.Aside from cow's milk, calcium can also be found in fortified nut and grain milks.
Some orange juices are fortified with calcium.
Dark leafy vegetables such as kale, bok choy, collards, and broccoli are all great sources of calcium.
In addition, you can find calcium in canned salmon, milk substitutes, oranges, pinto beans, rhubarb, and spinach.You should not ingest more than 2,000-3,000 mg of calcium, depending on your age.Find out exactly how much calcium you need here.

, Riboflavin is a nutrient that is mainly found in dairy products and is essential to your body's health. Deficiency in riboflavin can cause megaloblastic anemia, mouth sores, skin disorders, and swelling of mucus membranes.Riboflavin should be taken daily. Adolescent and adult males should take 1.4–1.8mgs daily, while females of the same age range should take 1.2-1.3mgs daily.
Non-dairy sources of riboflavin are legumes, nuts, green leafy vegetables, eggs and lean meat.
Riboflavin is found in tablet and capsule form. It can also be taken through vitamin supplements.

, Vitamin D is essential to your health, and is most often found in dairy products, so consume enough alternatives to stay healthy.Some alternative sources of vitamin D are fish, eggs, and cod liver oil.
For ages 1-70, and any women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, 600IU is the daily limit for vitamin D, in tablet form. For those who are over 71 years old, 800IU is an acceptable daily limit.Another way to boost vitamin D levels in your body is through sunlight exposure. As little as 10 minutes a day of exposure to sun can help prevent a vitamin D deficiency.

, Protein is an important part of a balanced diet, because it helps maintain tissue growth and healing. Although dairy is a great source of protein, you can still get this essential nutrient from alternative sources.

Two to three portions of protein-rich food are needed every day. Favor plant based sources of protein over meat.
Legumes are a healthy choice for protein. Legumes include beans, peas, and lentils.Additional dairy-free options include red meat, nuts, skinless chicken, and fish.
Men aged 19-70 should get at least 56 grams of protein every day. Women aged 19-70 should get at least 46 grams. These amounts should be slightly higher if pregnant or lactating.

, Eliminating dairy from your diet may be desirable, however, it also means re-balancing your diet. A proper diet that provides the right amount of nutrition is important to your health. Make sure you follow some of these general suggestions to get all the vitamins and nutrients you need.

Get plenty of carbohydrates. These are a great source of energy for your body. Try eating legumes, vegetables, and whole grains to get plenty of carbohydrates in your diet.
Consume foods with fiber. Fiber can help with cholesterol levels and prevent constipation. Vegetables, whole grains, oats, and dried beans are good providers of fiber. Women should get about 25 grams every day, and men should get 38. However, you should consult your doctor for the exact amount that's right for you.
Monitor sugar levels. Sugar, although a provider of energy, should be limited as it can easily add excessive calories to your diet. You should consume no more than 100 calories worth of sugar a day. You could start limiting your sugar intake by cutting out soda and other sugary drinks. Look instead for diet or zero calorie soda.
Eat unsaturated fats. Since you are cutting out dairy, you will avoid a prime source of unhealthy fats in your diet. Replace dairy fats with unsaturated fats found in fish and lean chicken. For good sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, try soybeans, safflower, canola, flaxseed, or corn oil.
Watch your cholesterol intake. Although a critical component of a healthy body, enough cholesterol is made by your body without the need for consuming extra in your diet. Limit foods such as beef, poultry and egg yolks. Daily, we should only eat about 10-12 grams of fat that are high in unsaturated fat.

Put on your feel-good music.",How to Get Energized," Recent studies have shown that both workers and athletes speed up their performance when around the scent of peppermint.So if you're feeling drained, pop a peppermint or some peppermint gum to help get you energized.


Or you could assault your nose with some strong scents, peppermint included. If you have some essential oils handy, one big whiff could be all you need to set your senses on high alert.;
, Caffeine, which is found in coffee, tea, sodas and energy drinks, are great for a short boost of energy. Doctors recommend that healthy adults limit their caffeine intake to 400 milligrams per day, which is about four cups of coffee, 10 cans of soda, or two ""energy shot"" drinks.While 400 milligrams is safe for adults to consume on a daily basis, excessive caffeine intake can lead to high blood pressure, insomnia, irritability, upset stomach and muscle tremors. So try to limit the amount of caffeine you drink each day to an absolute minimum.Caffeine will definitely give you a quick shot of energy in the short-term, but does little to help you ward off fatigue throughout the course of the day. Be sure to eat healthy and drink plenty of water to avoid an energy crash later in the day.
Limiting your intake of caffeine to the morning hours can help you avoid insomnia in the evening or nighttime. Also, it is wise to hold-off on that first cup of coffee or soda until after nine a.m. Your body naturally produces cortisol at higher levels between eight and nine a.m. and caffeine can actually diminish that natural rush you would otherwise feel., Not only are chia seeds trendy, but they're rumored to have some serious energy-boosting benefits as well.Chia is full of B vitamins, fiber, and protein, so it can help give you an extra boost of energy.


Chia seeds mix well with yogurt or can be mixed into your favorite flavor of smoothie. You can also put them in breads or muffins.

, So you want a brick of grain and protein to keep you going? Energy drinks and power bars are all well and good, but if you make them yourself they're even better. Homemade goods avoid the extra processing, so they're that much healthier.Nuts and nut butters are great at providing you with an extra kick of protein and some healthy fats.Bananas are tasty and ready source of potassium and B vitamins.Coconut oil can provide fatty acids that are healthy and provide you with a quick burst of energy.Leafy greens mixed into a smoothie can help you get more vitamin A, C and K. They are also a good source for B complex vitamins.Greek yogurt can add a nice smooth texture to your drink while also providing a healthy source of protein., Water itself is a great revitalizer, so drink plenty of it to stay awake and alert.You can get water from food sources, too, such as soup and watermelon.


Research suggests that adult men should try to consume three liters of water per day and adult women should try to consume 2.2 liters of water per day., If you're feeling a little down for the count, it may be snack time. Not only does this give you the jolt you need, but it could prevent you from overeating later, too.To do your body a favor, pair complex carbs with protein. A piece of fruit with some peanut or almond butter is a good choice. Cheese, some yogurt, or a protein shake are all good options as well.

, To stay energized through a draining day, first things first: you need breakfast. And we're not talking the dough-with-the-hole-in-the-middle kind. A good breakfast means protein and fiber, not a plate full of carbohydrates. Choose whole grains, lean meats, eggs, and fruits for your breakfast.After breakfast, your body needs more protein to stay alert. Good sources of protein include poultry, fish, lean red meat, nuts, milk, yogurt, eggs, yogurt, cheese, and tofu.Recent researched has pointed toward omega-3s and magnesium in the fight against the drowsiness. They both can improve mood and help transform carbs into energy. Munch on tuna, walnuts, almonds, flax seeds, and leafy greens to get these nutrients into your system., Laughing increases your heart rate and activates your muscular system. Therefore, laughing is great for feeling energized. Take a break from work and go watch that silly YouTube clip. If the boss catches you, you were just busy motivating yourself.Thinking positive thoughts will help, too. Have you ever noticed that sad, pessimistic thinking just sort of shuts you down and makes you want to clam up? Concentrating on a can-do attitude can help make everything seem a little more doable., Research shows that hitting the snooze button actually makes you more tired.Think of it this way: you're waking up, falling back into a kind of half-sleep, waking up, falling back into a kind of half-sleep, and repeating and repeating until you finally get out of bed. This just makes you more drowsy – you'd be better off spending that half an hour getting actual rest.


If you're just too tired to get up, you need to go to bed earlier. Aim for just 15 or 20 minutes earlier and you may be surprised at the difference it makes., Thought yawning was just when you were tired or when your body needed oxygen? Think again. It also wakes up your brain, cooling it down and sending it a burst of energy.So yawn away, because it's actually good for you.

, Our bodies are still programmed like our ancestors. We have urges that call for fight or flight and we still attribute color with meaning. Just like animals get alarmed at the color red, so do we.If you want to wake up your primitive mind, look at something red.


If being sleepy is constantly a problem, you may want to consider putting specks of red all around you, whether it's at work, home, or school. Abandon seasonal colors (winter is so blah) and go for brighter shades, red included. This means your wardrobe, too., Sometimes being tired has less to do with how much sleep you got and more to do with what you've been doing all day. The brain can only handle so much stimuli and sometimes being tired is its way of telling you that it needs a break.


Or just take a moment to do whatever the heck you want. A piece of dark chocolate, a moment with a book, a video game – whatever you want. If it makes you feel good, take a minute to do it. You'll be happier and feel better.

, You don't necessarily have to exercise to feel rejuvenated. Just stretching may do the trick. Grab the top (or sides) of a door frame and push your chest forward. Hold it for 30 seconds. Stretching out your core will bring more blood to your brain, energizing you.If you're stuck at your desk, make it a point to get up regularly. This is an instance where your brain needs different stimulation to wake up. So get up off your chair, walk around, grab some water, and you may be able to hop back to it., Exercising is one of the most common ways to get energy flowing within you again. Though it may seem like the last thing you want to do right now, once you get out there, you'll feel better.If you don't have enough energy to go out and exercise, do something small like jumping jacks, knee lifts, a few push-ups, or whatever suits you.Or just go for a walk. Getting outside, getting some fresh air, and moving around will do you good.
Though it may the hardest to do, exercising in the morning can charge you for the entire day., A messy desk, kitchen, or home can be a serious drag. You may not realize it, but just being in that environment could wear you down. Even if it just means throwing a few papers into a folder, do it. One little step often leads to much bigger ones.Imagine how good it'll feel to come home or to work to a clean space. You'll be happier to be where you and get energized just by being somewhere with such good chi. Even just a 15-minute effort can help you start seeing improvements., With a vitamin D deficiency, you'll feel lethargic and lazy. To get this nutrient, you'll need to get some much-needed sunlight. Throw open the windows or go walk the dog.This is why areas that are wintery 24-7 have higher rates of Seasonal Affective Disorder. People become sadder and more withdrawn when there's no sunlight. If you live in an area that gets very little sun, or you work indoors all the time, consider getting a sun lamp that can up your body's levels of melatonin., Turn on your music player and start making a playlist. It should be full of tunes that rev you up and make you feel good, inspiring you to move. If you have to, throw headphones on so as not to bother those around you. It'll take you out of the dull moment and get you into a more inspiring one.Once in a while, we have to slow down. If you're not feeling energized because your life is so hectic, consider throwing on some classical music, or some slower instrumentals. You brain may then be able to slow down to normal speed, allowing your body the energy it needs."

Even if a dispensary is a significant distance from you, many dispensaries offer delivery services.;
, You do not want to go to a dispensary that is at risk of getting shut down due to illegal operations. When you get to a dispensary, they should ask for a photo ID and also check for verification that you are a legitimate medical marijuana patient. A dispensary that simply lets you walk in without any kind of identification is probably not following legal protocol. It may be best to take your business elsewhere. An illegal dispensary can get shut down at any time, leaving you without access to your medicine., It's vital you review a dispensary's privacy policies, as well as its policies regarding patient rights. You want to make sure your information will be kept securely at the dispensary you choose. You can usually review a dispensary's website to find information regarding privacy and patient policies, but you can also ask for a copy of these policies when visiting a dispensary.There should be a policy that states clearly your information will not be shared with outside parties without your consent.
When visiting a dispensary, you want to make sure your privacy rights are stated up front when you see a doctor or purchase a product.
A dispensary should operate like any other health organization. It's privacy and patient rights policy should be as extensive as those found in a hospital or a pharmacy.

, When you go to a dispensary, you should first make a visit to the staff doctor. Staff doctors at dispensaries may give out medicinal marijuana cards or provide information to patients regarding different strains of marijuana. You want a knowledgeable doctor who conducts him or herself in a professional manner. You should also make sure the a dispensaries staff members are well-informed as well.The doctor working at the dispensary should be a physician (MD), a naturopathic doctor (ND), a doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine (DTCM), or a nurse practitioner. These are medical professionals authorized to hand out medical marijuana cards. Talking to a doctor who prescribes medical marijuana should be just like talking to your regular physician.
The atmosphere of a dispensary should be similar to that of a pharmacy or hospital. If you have any questions for the staff, they should be able to answer them professionally. A dispensary with a doctor or staff members that seem to lack knowledge of the science behind medicinal marijuana is a bad sign. You want a dispensary where all your questions can be answered easily.

, A good dispensary will be invested in raising community awareness of the benefits of medicinal marijuana. An involved dispensary is more likely to have staff and doctors who genuinely care about their patients' well-being.Ask the staff about how the dispensary is involved with the local community. Do they do any community outreach or education programs? Do they ever work in conjunction with local hospitals?
A dispensary should also be willing to advocate for patients. Ask the dispensary if their staff and doctors would come to your aid if your status as a medicinal marijuana patient were to be questioned. A solid dispensary should be filled with passionate people committed to making sure patient needs are met and that people are assured access to their medication., A dispensary should be professional. You do not want to work with staff and doctors who do not value professionalism when it comes to providing medicinal marijuana.The dispensary should want to make sure they do not violate any laws or interfere with the community. There should be signs that forbid smoking on site. If the dispensary is near a school or anywhere that children congregate, you should see warnings against using medicinal marijuana close to young children.
The dispensary should not feel like a liquor store or a head shop. It should feel on par with a hospital or pharmacy. Strains of marijuana should come with instructions on what type of ailments they treat.

, You want to feel welcome at your dispensary. Many dispensaries have a harsh atmosphere. They may be located in a bad part of town, and have heavy security and unfriendly staff. You want to feel 100% safe and comfortable walking into a dispensary.The staff should be warm and welcoming. They should encourage you to ask questions if you have them, and the layout of the dispensary should be easy to navigate.
Many dispensaries offer smoke-free lounges where you can look over your medication options before making a decision. Ideally, a dispensary should provide reading material for patients regarding the types of products they sell.

, There are a couple of things you should watch out for when it comes to dispensaries.Pay attention to how a dispensary advertises itself. There should not be gaudy signs with a lot of colors and other loud advertisements. A dispensary should advertise itself as a hospital or pharmacy and not a place for entertainment.
People should not be smoking inside a dispensary. A professional dispensary generally does not allow smoking inside.
Heavy security may indicate a dispensary is in an unsafe part of town, or that they deal with unprofessional dealers.
A dispensary should have consistent hours of operation. You do not want to rely on a dispensary with unpredictable hours.

, You should ask at the dispensary what means are used to assure a high-quality product. You should be able to tell, by reading dispensary policies online or at the store, how they assure quality.For instance, the dispensary should follow a series of food safety protocols regarding its edibles. They should assure patients that edibles are made in a clean environment, on par with a professional kitchen.
The dispensary should double check any products not grown onsite. Products should be checked for signs of age, mold, or any other potential contaminants.

, There are a vast number of strains of medical marijuana available. If you're a new patient, you may not know what you need yet. Find a dispensary that has a great variety of strains of marijuana, as well as edibles and balms. Check to make sure the dispensary sells those strains, balms, or edible options.Ideally, a dispensary should sell indicas, sativas, and hybrid blends of marijuana.
A dispensary should also offer alternative means of consuming marijuana, as not everyone takes to smoking. Edibles, balms, tinctures, and inhalants may also be offered.
You can usually check on a dispensary's website to see what they carry. You can also browse the selections when visiting the dispensary.

, The best means to tell if you like a dispensary's product is to test them out yourself. Buying a few strains from each dispensary can get expensive, however, but some dispensaries may offer free samples if you ask. If you cannot afford to try out the marijuana yourself, try reading reviews.Yelp, Leafly, and Weedmaps provide user reviews of dispensaries. People may make notes here about the quality of the product.
If you know any other medicinal marijuana patients, try asking them for advice about the quality at a variety of dispensaries.

, A good dispensary will know where its products come from. Staff members at the dispensary should be able to answer any and all questions you have about where and how the marijuana was grown. They should have an open and working relationship with their growers. Be wary of a dispensary that dodges questions about their product's origin, as this may be a sign the medicine is potentially unsafe., If price is an issue, there are many online tools you can use to find the cheapest strains of medical marijuana. The site Wikileaf allows you to put in a specific price range and search for dispensaries in your area that offer that range. Keep in mind, however, not all dispensaries will have their prices listed online.The average price is around $15 per gram. Anything more expensive than this may not be worth the money."

Pick a form.,
Try it for detoxifying.,
Use it for gas and bloating.,
Pair it with a digestive cleanse.,
Use it for instances of poisoning.",How to Gain Potential Health Benefits from Activated Charcoal1," You can find activated charcoal in forms like liquid, tablets, pills, suspension, or powder forms.You can also take activated charcoal in forms like lemonade or smoothies.What you choose is up to you, based on how you want to use it. The tablet and pill forms tend to be more concentrated.


You can find activated charcoal online or at health supplement stores.
Always ask your doctor before taking a supplement. Your doctor can advice you on dosages for activated charcoal.;
, Some people have had good luck with using activated charcoal to detoxify their body. Activated charcoal binds to other substances, a process known as ""adsorption,"" carrying what it binds to out of your body.When people talk about detoxifying, they are saying that it is removing toxins and chemicals from your body that you may ingest or absorb from your environment. However, as long as you're healthy, your body does a pretty good job of removing these things by itself through the kidneys and liver.However, keep in mind that activated charcoal is indiscriminate. It will bind to both good and bad things in your body, taking them out of your system., Some people use activated charcoal to help with gas and bloating. Try taking 500 milligrams of activated charcoal an hour and 30 minutes before a meal. You can take tablets or pills, but be sure you drink a full glass of water with it. You may find it helps reduce your gas pain.You can also drink an extra glass of water to help the charcoal get there more quickly.
However, using charcoal before a meal may decrease your absorption of important nutrients.

, Another way people use activated charcoal is when they are on a digestive cleanse. For instance, some people may eat only fruits, vegetables, and proteins that are easy on the body, along with activated charcoal for a week to help cleanse the system., Activated charcoal has traditionally been used when someone has been poisoned. However, it is only somewhat effective for this purpose, as it doesn't bind with things like alcohol, petroleum products, lithium, boric acids, iron, strong acids, and alkalis. Therefore, it should only be given under the direction of a doctor for this purpose."

Research naturopathy.,
Find out the laws governing naturopathic treatment in your jurisdiction.,
Identify what kind of care you’re looking for.,
Be aware of the risks involved in the modality you choose.,
Consider the cost of treatment.,
Consider what kind of naturopathic practitioner you want.,
Look for naturopathic doctors on the internet.,
Ask for references.,
Look for personal websites.,
Look for appropriate credentials.,
See if you and your doctor are compatible.,
Ask about the practice’s policies.,
Assess the staff.",How to Find a Naturopathic Doctor," Before deciding to seek out a naturopathic doctor, read up on the principles and effectiveness of naturopathy.


Talk to your current healthcare provider. Your current doctor will be able to help you make an informed choice about the potential benefits of naturopathic medicine versus its potential downsides.
Check the web. Naturopathic practitioners and organisations in many countries have websites outlining the basic ideas of naturopathy. Many of the critiques of naturopathic medicine from the point of view of conventional medicine can also be found online. Take the time to read around the subject and decide what you think.
Ask your friends, colleagues or family. See if members of your community have experiences with naturopathic healing. Their experience may help you make your own choice.;
, The regulations governing naturopathy vary dramatically between countries and regions. In particular, some jurisdictions allow naturopathic practitioners to prescribe drugs and perform some surgery. Find out what the laws in your jurisdiction allow naturopathic practitioners to do.


In some jurisdictions – such as South Carolina and Tennessee in the US – naturopathic practice is forbidden.Ensure your jurisdiction doesn’t forbid the practice of naturopathic medicine.
In many places, naturopathic practice is not regulated by law, so anyone can claim to be a naturopathic practitioner. Be careful not to go to a practitioner with no training!

, Naturopathic medicine covers a number of different types of treatment. These are known as 'modalities'. Decide which kind of modality suits your needs better, and use this to find a naturopath who focuses on this area of health.There is no set or defined list of modalities which naturopathic medicine encompasses, but here are some common examples:


Botanical medicine. This is the use of plants to treat or prevent disease, using the purported natural healing properties of plant.
Homeopathic medicine. This involves the use of very small doses of natural substances to stimulate the body's self-healing abilities. It has been singled out by practitioners of conventional medicine as particularly ineffective.Lifestyle counselling. This involves a naturopathic doctor working with you to develop a healthier lifestyle.

, Because naturopathic medicine offers so varied a range of treatment options, the potential risks vary similarly widely. Search online or ask your current healthcare provider to assess the risks associated with the treatment you are looking for.

, In most countries, naturopathic treatments are only available if you pay for them yourself. For instance, in the US, most health insurance plans do not cover naturopathy.In the UK, the NHS does not provide naturopathic treatments.Because naturopathic medicine is practiced in many countries and covers such a wide range of treatments, it is not possible to give an idea of typical associated costs. Investigate the cost of the kind of naturopathic care you're looking for, and decide whether you can afford it.

, In some countries, including the US and Canada, there’s a difference between ‘naturopathic physicians’ and ‘naturopaths’ (also known as ‘traditional naturopaths’).


Naturopathic physicians train at a naturopathic medical school, and earn ND (‘Naturopathic Doctor’) or NMD (‘Naturopathic Medical Doctor’) degrees. They have more of a background in conventional medicine, and are often subject to more strict professional licensing regulations.
Traditional naturopaths attend schools with varying curricula and graduation requirements. They are likely to lean more towards more purely alternative therapies. In most places, they are ineligible to practice medicine. If your beliefs also lean towards a wholesale rejection of conventional medicine, a traditional naturopath may very well fit your requirements., Most countries and regions have professional bodies which have directories of naturopathic practitioners. Begin your search by looking in these directories for practitioners in your local area. This will help you create a shortlist of potential candidates who are close to where you live.A lot of what you're looking for will depend on your personal priorities when looking for a doctor. Decide on your priorities in advance. For instance, consider your views on how far you reject modern, conventional or invasive medical techniques, or what gender you prefer your doctor to be. Once you have decided on these priorities, use them when creating your shortlist.

, Talk to other people who’ve used naturopathic doctors, whether from your local community or on internet message boards. They may have useful tips and recommendations about which naturopathic doctor to choose.


Ask in other kinds of places connected to alternative treatments, such as health shops. These places will often have ties to other alternative healthcare providers, and may be able to point you in the right direction.
Be sure to ask why the doctor is being referred to you. It’s important that your priorities match up with those of the person doing the referring!, See if the practices you are investigating have an online presence. If they do, have a look at the website to get a sense of the personality of the doctor and the atmosphere of their practice. This will help give you an initial idea of their personal approaches to medical practice and patient welfare before you go deeper.

, Because naturopathic regulatory bodies are usually not subject to statutory regulation, the nature and reliability of their qualifications are extremely variable. Research your region's regulatory body or bodies and determine what kind of qualification you should be looking for. If possible, ask others who have used naturopathic doctors which credential-issuing institutions are more reputable.


A naturopathic physician should have earned a degree in naturopathic medicine from a naturopathic medical school accredited by your jurisdiction’s professional regulatory body for naturopathic education.
Look for appropriate professional certification. Naturopathic doctors should be licensed by a professional organisation. There are often multiple professional organisations in an area - ask around to find which is the most reputable., It’s important that your doctor has a good bedside manner, and that you get on well with them. Arrange a phone call with your prospective doctor to introduce yourself and get to know them. This will help you understand whether or not your personalities, beliefs and approaches to healthcare are compatible.Potential topics to cover include how the doctor makes decisions, how far they co-operate with patients in deciding on a course of treatment, and how much they communicate with patients about their issues.
The specific topics to investigate will of course be determined by your own priorities. Decide in advance what you are looking for most in a healthcare provider, and tailor your questions accordingly.

, Find out how long it takes to get an appointment, whether same-day appointments are available, and how long patients have to wait before seeing the doctor. The staff at the naturopathic practice should be able to tell you this important information., A naturopathic medical practitioner will be part of a team, and it’s important to see how good that team is. The most significant factors to consider are their courteousness and their efficiency. As you ask them for other information about the practice, form your opinion about their own reliability.If the staff are rude or inefficient, these are warning signs that the practice should be avoided.
Similarly, if there are problems passing your messages to the doctor or arranging appointments, even if the staff are courteous, this is also a probable red flag.

Understand that “natural” does not always mean safe.,
Think twice about big promises or “miracle” cures.,
Look past the jargon.,
Avoid cure-alls.,
Don’t fall for “limited time offers.” Legitimate medical treatments are not usually sold using the same methodology as cable TV plans.,
Remember that natural medicines don’t have to be tested.",How to Evaluate Natural Medical Treatments1," There are many naturally occurring substances that are poisonous or otherwise hazardous to people. Many people value terms like “natural” and “organic,” and possibly for good reason, but don’t allow buzzwords to skew your perspective on non-traditional medical treatments.While natural products can be healthier for you in some regards, don’t allow marketing terms to blind you to possible risks.
Look for other qualifications to verify the credibility of a medical treatment beyond the terms used to market it.;
, There are many scams in the alternative medicine industry that take advantage of people’s desire for overnight transformations and miraculous recoveries. These people prey on those who are looking for help and the products are often not regulated by any government.Be skeptical if you see advertising guaranteeing results that sound too good to be true.
Remember that miracle cures, if truly effective, would be widely reported on in the media and would become commonly prescribed traditional treatments.

, Many natural medical treatments and health supplements may try to dazzle you with technical wording on the packaging and in their marketing materials. Remember that using complex pharmaceutical terms does not necessarily mean the product has medical value. Some common words used to distract you from a lack of real scientific basis are:Detoxify
Energize
Purify

, Most traditional and non-traditional or natural medical treatments are developed with a single purpose in mind. These treatments can be an effective method of treating the illnesses they were designed for, but products that suggest that they can cure a multitude of health issues are often untrue.Very few single products can effectively treat a wide variety of symptoms or illnesses.
Remember that claiming a product can do something does not necessarily mean it actually can. False claims are made through marketing materials and on packaging all the time.

, When a company suggests that you can only receive a medical treatment at a certain price or at all for a “limited time,” they are using a sales technique designed to convince you to make a purchase, not necessarily intended to help you get healthier.Avoid companies that suggest your opportunity to receive treatment is subject to how quickly you are willing to pay them.
Phrases like, “limited time,” “act now,” or “before it’s too late” are all intended to drive sales, not improve health.

, There is no current law requiring the testing of natural or alternative medicines and the Federal Drug Administration usually only intervenes upon receipt of complaints about the safety of a product. In other words, many natural medicines can advertise results that have not been appropriately tested, or even tested at all.Dietary supplements are unregulated and are not required to prove their effectiveness in any formal way.
In order to have a product restricted or removed from shelves, the burden of proof is on the FDA to prove a product causes harm. This can take months or even years.

Contact a compounding pharmacy in your state.,
Consider the pharmacy’s quality assurance programme.,
If in doubt, ask your doctor.",How to Find a Compounding Pharmacy2," Once you have identified some compounded pharmacies, call them up to ask if they can fill your prescription. In the first instance you should contact a pharmacy in your state. Not only is this likely to be more convenient, but you should bear in mind that some compounding pharmacies will only have a licence to operate in a specific state.If this is the case, and you are crossing state lines, the pharmacies may be unable to dispense your prescription.

, If you come across a number of compounding pharmacies in your area you may want to consider which one to contact first. Remember that this is a highly regulated industry, but a physician looking to make contact and develop a partnership with a compounding pharmacy will often seek to determine how the pharmacy is run, and what quality assurance programmes they have.


A doctor might ask whether the pharmacy uses Professional Compounding Centres of America tested formulas and pharmaceutical ingredients.
A doctor might also ask about the training schemes for staff in the pharmacy, and how patients are instructed on how to take their medication., If you have found some compound pharmacies but are at all uncertain about which one to visit, be sure to check in with your doctor and ask her advice. She will most likely have a better knowledge of the local services than you do, and more experience of working with different compounding pharmacies and pharmacists.


Don’t worry about annoying or hassling your doctor, but always be polite and patient.

Try brushing your teeth with it.,
Use it in a face mask.,
Apply it to bug bites.",How to Gain Potential Health Benefits from Activated Charcoal2," One way some people use activated charcoal is when they brush your teeth. Just wet and put toothpaste on your brush as usual. Sprinkle or dip the brush into activated charcoal, then brush your teeth normally. Don't worry, you won't taste anything, although it will turn your mouth temporarily black.Some people say using charcoal on your teeth gets them whiter and cleaner. However, you don't want to use it on your teeth too much, as it is abrasive and could harm your teeth over time.
Talk to your dentist before starting this treatment, as they know your specific needs.

, Some facial masks use activated charcoal as an ingredient. You'll use the mask like any other you would use. You rub it on your face and leave it for the amount of time it requires you to, then wash it off. Make sure to follow the directions on the package carefully.When you use activated charcoal on your face, you may have to scrub a bit to get it off.

, Another application some people use activated charcoal for is bug bites. Make a paste out of activated charcoal and coconut oil, and apply it to the bite. Make sure to cover with a bandage, as it will stain clothing, furniture, and carpet.You can try something similar with acne, except mix the charcoal with aloe vera instead of coconut oil. Apply it to the acne. Let it dry, then rinse it off.

Search the internet for natural medicines you are interested in.,
Judge the credibility of online sources.,
Look for information provided by experts.,
Understand the difference between efficacy and effectiveness.,
Ask a trusted doctor.",How to Evaluate Natural Medical Treatments2," If you find a natural product or service that you think may be beneficial to you, spend some time researching it on the internet. Look for websites that discuss the specific product you are thinking about purchasing and read what other people are saying about it.


Try searching the name of the product followed by the word “scam” to bring up results that may discuss any complaints previous customers have had with a product.
Read product reviews on independent sites that can tell you if the product didn’t work or caused negative side effects.

, It’s important that you learn to differentiate between marketing materials and credible sources, as some websites go out of their way to present themselves as something they’re not. Use these tips to help differentiate between reputable medical websites and sites designed to help sell a product:Look at the way the page is designed and how the content is written. Does it look professional? Be wary of sites with spelling or grammatical errors.
Look for an author of the content and do an internet search to see if they have credentials.

, There are a few web pages that offer information provided by experts in the medical field. These sites require a level of credibility in the field in order to provide content, so you can be confident the information you find on them is accurate. Search the databases of these two sites as a start:


Look for information on https://www.NIH.gov to see if the product or service has been discussed by that National Institutes of Health.
Go to http://www.mayoclinic.org to see the medical professionals at the Mayo Clinic have provided a review or research on the product or service you are interested in.

, When medical treatments are studied, the two measured outcomes of the testing are the efficacy of the treatment and its effectiveness in treating the illness in real world applications. In order to be an effective treatment for a medical issue you have, a treatment must prove to have both high efficacy as well as effectiveness.Efficacy measures the treatment’s ability to produce a change in biological or psychosocial functions in a controlled, laboratory setting.
Effectiveness is the measure of a treatment’s ability to actually produce a beneficial outcome in real world applications.
Some treatments may have a high efficacy rating with a low level of effectiveness. If a treatment does not demonstrate high levels of effectiveness, it likely will not help you.

, If you have a doctor that you trust, you should discuss any natural medicines you are considering taking with him or her. Your doctor can help by explaining the way treatments may affect you and share their own experiences with other patients seeking natural treatment options.


It’s important your doctor knows what natural medicines you take in order to ensure they don’t prescribe a medication that may react negatively to the natural treatment.
Your doctor may be able to offer suggestions for alternate or natural medicines that can benefit you.

Talk to your doctor.,
Contact your health insurance company.,
Check with national associations.,
Ask questions.,
Make sure your CAM practitioner is aware of your medical history.",How to Evaluate Natural Medical Treatments3," It is not uncommon for people to seek what is known as a CAM Practitioner. CAM means “Complementary and Alternative Medicine.” CAM Practitioners offer treatments that often complement your current traditional course of treatment or may offer an alternative to it. Ask your doctor if they can refer you to a qualified CAM practitioner in the area.Qualifications to become a CAM Practitioner vary widely from state to state, so your doctor may be able to help you find one that is highly credible.
You may also want to discuss any treatment prescribed by a CAM practitioner with your primary care physician.

, Some treatments offered by CAM practitioners may be covered by your health insurance. If this is the case, they can often provide you with suggestions for practitioners in your area that have the appropriate certifications to be eligible for your insurance to cover the treatment. Some common CAM treatments that may be covered by your health insurance include:Acupuncture
Biofeedback
Chiropractic Care
Electronic Stimulation, There are a few different national associations for CAM Practitioners that you can contact in order to ensure the person you seek treatment from has attained all of the necessary credentials. While these associations will not usually refer you to specific practitioners, you can contact them to ensure the practitioner you have chosen is in their database.The National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine can be contacted at (904) 598-1005.
The American Massage Therapy Association can be contacted by calling 877-905-0577 (toll-free).

, At your first appointment, ask your CAM practitioner about their training and credentials. They should be happy to discuss their qualifications with you, so if they seem unwilling or hesitant, you may want to seek treatment elsewhere. If the CAM practitioner specializes in treating a certain illness or ailment, ask them how often they see people in your situation.
Discuss the cost of treatment up front to ensure you aren’t surprised by the cost of treatment.

, When you find a CAM practitioner you trust, make sure you discuss your medical history and any current medical issues you are facing before you begin a course of treatment. It’s important that the practitioner is aware of medications that you are taking and other illness that may affect their prescribed course of treatment.You may also want to discuss any treatment you are prescribed by your practitioner with your primary care doctor.

Begin by focusing on a part of your body that is hurting you.,
Focus your willpower on the part of your body that you have decided is hurting.,
Change your strategy.,
Stop trying.,
Try different ways of telling yourself that you're resting.,
Repeat until this method works best for you.,
Be accepting of the value of resting like it matters.",How to Rest Intentionally," It can be a sore part of your body or an inflamed area such as your neck or shoulders. Or, it might be your mind if it's full of racing, uncontrollable, negative or unhappy thoughts. Or perhaps it's your skin, your knees, your lymphatic system, your broken heart – just pick whichever part of your body is hurting most or causing you the most discomfort in your opinion.;
, What do you notice when you do this? For most people, you'll find that your body as a whole, including the painful area, tenses up. Be aware that this is a common strategy that we use to try to deal with pain – yet you've just learned that it doesn't work so well!

, This time, pretend that the pain is no longer present. Ignore the pain and tell yourself that you're not hurting. This strategy is like playing peekaboo – first you see it but then when you no longer pay attention to it, you expect it to go away even though it's still very much there. Consider how this makes you feel – does the pain go away? No? You've just discovered another common strategy for dealing with pain that doesn't work!

, Now say the following phrase to yourself, either in your head or out loud: ""I am resting for now."" Then just pause. Think about what you notice now. For many people, focusing on resting works far better than working at trying to fix something relentlessly or to try to hide from it. Indeed, Dan Howard says that the more you work at trying to stop the pain, the less successful you will be. Instead, intentional resting requires that you notice what is going on in your body and then choose to rest what hurts.


This exercise can be done anywhere – you don't have to stop what you're doing but can incorporate this desire to rest the hurting part of your body into whatever it is you're doing. It can be done when walking, exercising, sitting, lying down, or being around other people.

, This isn't by any means an exact science and it'll require some trial and error on your own behalf to find what works for you. For example, Dan Howard has found that some parts of his body respond better to saying ""I'm resting into my "" than saying ""I'm resting for "". The aim is to find a settling feeling, a feeling that you've landed into deep restfulness for that pained part of yourself and you're releasing yourself from unease, anxiety and discomfort. It's a healing process and a restorative process.


It may be as simple as saying to the hurting part of your body: ""Rest"". Give it the permission to rest.

, It may take a number of attempts before the pieces fall into place and you discover how intentional rest soothes you and allows you to truly rest to the point of restoring your energy and reducing any pain.

, Rest does matter and yet it is tied up in so many negative connotations such as being lazy, selfish or unaware that many of us are too guilt-ridden to treat rest as the restorative we deserve. Martha Beck points out that we need to watch animals to be reminded what real rest is like. She relates an incident where she was watching a pride of lions resting after an unsuccessful hunt. Instead of sitting around down and low about it (and analyzing what went wrong if they could do such a thing), they sat, purred and rested for hours, surrendering to the need to regain strength rather than wallow in defeat.Yes, life can be hard and sometimes life stacks up all the odds against us and causes us to feel that we never get a break. However, by choosing to rest intentionally, you can heal the scars and restore your energy to face the challenges with greater strength and sense of purpose.

Be compassionate with yourself.,

Quit rushing about.,

Meditate.,

Practice cat yoga.,

Hide out.,

Purr now and then.,

Be grateful for small things.,

Cuddle, hug, and nuzzle.",How to Relax Like a Cat," Cats don't beat themselves up over not being beautiful enough, acceptable enough, tidy enough, rich enough, healthy enough, or clever enough. They don't stress about foolish things like bad luck. Cats just get on with loving themselves the way they are.
, The only times a cat rushes about is when a) it's fun to do so (like chasing a bumblebee) b) the chase has food at the end of it, or c) when they are chasing each other, during mating season. Apart from these three really good excuses, cats stretch out, relax, lick themselves (OK, maybe you don't need to go that far), and sleep., Cats take time out to contemplate the world around them and to just be. Time to be a copycat., Ever wondered why some exercises require you to ""stretch like a cat""? The reason is simple - cats really and truly know how to stretch for benefit. A cat stretches to relieve tension and restore suppleness in an instant. A cat stretches the right way; follow her lead., A cat that needs respite doesn't hang around. She goes and finds a place to hang out and get over whatever is ailing her. Apart from serious injuries and death, she'll come back rejuvenated for having kept her distance. You could try this too.

Make your own special hiding space at home or in the garden where you can retreat to when the going gets tough. Go there, lick your wounds, and come back ready to pick up where you left off.

, All right, we don't purr. But we laugh and we don't do it often enough. Many a cat can be set off with the mere suggestion of a pat, cuddle, or comfy spot. And the contentment that comes with grooming! See the happiness around you, the wonder in everything, and feel happiness. And purr laugh a lot more, at things you've stopped noticing were funny, at things that you have always found funny.

Make others around you laugh too.
Groom your loved ones to increase their level of contentment - give someone you love a massage, a hair brush or cut, a foot rub, or a tickle.
Do the cat purr. In, out, in, out. Deep and methodical like the felines do. You don't have to make the rusty noise, just heave in your chest and breathe out slowly, like you're purring.

, As we're rushing off in the pursuit of perfection and bigger and better things, your cats are reveling in the length of your delicious green grass, plucking the daisies from your garden, chewing the cat toys strewn across your floor, and scratching the daylights out of your favorite couch. They have everything they need, right under their wee noses. And so do you, it's just that sometimes you're standing too high off the ground to notice. Get down and spend time seeing your world from your cat's perspective, and relearn the wonders in your own backyard., Whether it's because you or someone you love had a hard day, or because you're just keen to help another person relax, a good cuddle, hug, or nuzzle will always come in handy. Every cat knows this, which is why they perform these caring rituals regularly. And you might like to top it off by rubbing yourself on someone's legs... or maybe not."

You could be too stressed if:


All you do and think about is work, non-stop. It might be your own business, a career, a salaried position, a stay-at-home mom or dad position, or anything else that is soaking up your time and life one hundred percent, and this over-concentration is leaving you passionless, disappointed, unhappy, and unfulfilled.
You experience constant body tension, including headaches, neck aches, back aches, and general soreness.You're often irritable, short-tempered, and perhaps unable to focus on completing tasks. Trivial things set you off easily.
You feel as if you have too much going on and that you can't hop off the merry-go-round.
Your sleep is a battlefield and you wake up feeling less rested rather than refreshed. Insomnia has become your norm rather than an unusual event.
You're eating too much or too little. Or, you are choosing unhealthy food options.
You're drinking too little water.
You can't remember the last time you had a good laugh and your sense of humor is sadly lacking.;
, Once you have accepted that there are negative stressors impacting your life, it's important to make room for relaxation amid all those busy things you're doing. . Ways to prepare for adding relaxation back into your routine include:


Let go of guilt. Many religious and cultural beliefs instill the value of hard work very deeply. Over time, and increasingly so with the advent of smart technology that keeps us hyper-wired 24/7, many of us have come to believe that being ""on-the-go"" constantly is the only way to prove our value. Having an unrealistic interpretation of ""hard work"" will end up wearing you down. Hard work is giving your tasks the attention they deserve at the time they deserve, not letting it bleed into all hours of your day!
Accept that sleep is a very important part of life. During sleep, your mind continues learning in ways that are not possible during waking hours. Sleep restores and refreshes your body in myriad ways that cannot happen when you're awake. Do not be tempted to devalue the worth of sleep. Moreover, the alleged ability of some people to thrive on four hours sleep per night is the exception, not the rule — most of us need the six to eight hour sleep cycle for full restoration. Dreaming is an essential part of sleep; you can explore your inner fantasy and have many experiences that you never encounter in the waking world.
Block out times in your day to relax. Think of it as an appointment with your most important client — you — that you absolutely cannot skip or break.
If you're at home, mark time for relaxing in black ink on a calendar for everyone to see. That way, the whole family will appreciate the importance of making time to relax.
Recognize that finding your own optimal ways to relax may take time, as well as some trial and error. Don't give up — keep searching until you find the right combination of activities that relax you and rejuvenate your enthusiasm for living fully.

, Slow down your breathing and actively concentrate on it. This is always the easiest way to self-calm, provided you remember to resort to it.


Do belly breathing: where you put your hands on you stomach and when you breath in: you try to push away your hands, and when you breath out you make your hands go towards you
Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Inhale deeply as you count to five, hold your breath for five seconds, then exhale slowly, counting to five. Do this ten times to relax your muscles and nerves. As you breathe out, visualize the stress and tension leaving your body through your breath.

, Eating well can help your body feel balanced and healthy, making you less susceptible to spikes in blood sugar and feelings of anxiety. Try to practice moderation in these areas:


Avoid the excessive refined sugar found in granola bars, pastries or sodas. Carbohydrates, such as pasta, convert easily to sugar. These can cause severe ups and downs in your blood sugar and lead to agitation, upsetting your body's ability to efficiently utilize energy.
Avoid excessive caffeine. Too much caffeine can make you jumpy and irritable. Try not to drink caffeine after 1 or 2 in the afternoon, and keep your morning intake moderate and steady across every day. If you must have more coffee than you should, switch to decaf or an herbal tea with little or no caffeine.
Get a cup of water. Drinking a cup of water at once brings a fresh energy to your body and give a chance to your brain to take a small break in thinking, thus allows you to find a new view on current stressful situation. Works especially if you suffer a headache or did not drink for a long time.
Eat fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains that are free of refined sugar, such as apples, grapes, carrots, broccoli, brown rice or whole grain breads.
Eat plenty of low-calorie protein, such as chicken, fish, whole grains, legumes, dark leafy vegetables or low-fat dairy. These proteins are a better source of energy.
Take a multivitamin. Some vitamins relieve stress. Vitamin B and Vitamin D are especially good for relaxation.

, This is the best-known, scientifically-proven way to significantly reduce stress. You'll be amazed at how much easier it is to overcome stress if you exercise regularly. Here are some ideas to try:


Aim for at least thirty minutes per day of moderate activity.

Walk in the park, in the woods, or on a treadmill.
Take the stairs instead of the elevator.
Park a little further away from the entrance of a store.
Ride a bike.
Go swimming. Try your local pool, a nearby lake or a friend or relative's home. You do not have to be an excellent swimmer; just the idea of being in water could be relaxing enough.
Stretch. Lower your shoulders to help relax. Be more consciously aware of the tension that is quick to accumulate in your shoulders and neck region.

, Go to your local spa for a great massage. Undoing the body knots is a good pathway to undoing the mind knots.

, Positive thinking isn't about wishful or dreamer thinking; it's about making the most of the situations that you find yourself in and avoiding any tendency to add negative overlays.


Use visualization techniques. While you might not feel calm and relaxed, imagining a calm and relaxed scene in your mind can do wonders to improve your outlook. Picture beaches, lying down resting, going for a hike, etc., to help you stay relaxed.

Use affirmations to change your outlook on life and stop yourself from always jumping to negative conclusions. Affirmations are short, powerful statements that build you up and increase your confidence, helping you to expect positive outcomes.Be careful about the words you choose – the things you say about yourself over and over again will ensure that you believe your own rhetoric. Use positive, believable, and caring words about yourself.
Teach yourself to step back and see the ""big picture"" when you're in the thick of things that don't seem to be going well. Recognize that most problems are temporary, and minor setbacks on the path to achieving larger goals.

, If you learn to think more sequentially and logically when you're stressed, you might find that solutions become more apparent.


Turn an objective eye on your stressors. Take a realistic look at what's freaking you out, and consider how you'd advise a friend in a similar position. Then, follow your own advice.
Change your ways. If the problem is something you're doing, then change the way you act or react. Stop and listen to those around you to figure out and correct what it is you might be misunderstanding or doing wrong.

,


Draw a warm bath. Light candles around the tub, dim the lights, add bubbles or lavender, if desired.
Lie on your bed or sofa. Play some soft music or nature CDs. Relax listening to ocean waves, waterfalls or birds.
Read a good book. Curl up on the couch with a blanket and a cup of chamomile tea.
Imagine a personal paradise. Close your eyes and envision a different setting. What do you see around you? Is there a breeze? What do you hear - birds or water? Imagine the calming sound of ocean waves reaching the shore. Enjoy a moment in your special place.
Even the stall of a bathroom at work is an ideal ""quiet spot"" for a breather if you have no other place to go.

, Guilt is a potent source of stress. Get rid of the source of guilt by behaving yourself; stop engaging in behaviors that make you feel guilty. Seek professional help, if necessary, but don't allow destructive behavior to escalate and sabotage your life and health.

, Make a list of tasks for the day. Organize the list by importance, and be proactive and take care of things before they become a big problem. Time spent more productively means more free time to relax.


Work! Although this may sound counteractive to your goal of relaxing, procrastination never feels as good as having nothing to do. Get your tasks done now, and then you can truly relax.

, Remove all thoughts and emotions from your mind by concentrating on your breathing. Meditation takes you into focusing on your whole being as a form of relaxation, rather than just focusing on one area of your body as any other relaxation technique tends to do. It can take a while to master, but it is well worth the effort.


Begin with a sitting posture for a minimum of 15 minutes per session, and build up to 45–60 minutes per session.Try to meditate regularly.
Find a respected mentor if you are having difficulty learning meditation by yourself.
Avoid being intense, competitive, or frustrated about meditating – all of these emotions defeat its purpose!

, Focus on something, take a few deep breaths and let yourself become hypnotized. If you have trouble with self-hypnosis, go to a licensed hypnotherapist. Do not allow an amateur to try to hypnotize you, and beware of subliminal messages.

, Get your mind off the things that normally stress you out. You may just need a break every now and then.


Go fishing, sew, sing, paint or take photographs.
Try singing a song using numbers instead of words. Singing can help to distract you from stress to suddenly relax.
Use music as relaxation therapy. Play it as loudly or as softly as you like, whichever calms you the most.

, Cuddle or play with your pets. They'll love it and so will you. Talk to your pet about all the stress and anxiety you've been going through and you'll feel a lot better. Pet therapy is a genuine means for relaxing; you can also learn a lot from watching how your pet relaxes (note, animals don't carry guilt around!).

, Laughter is the best medicine. Rent, buy or see a hilarious movie. This is guaranteed to help. Smiling and laughing releases endorphins, which fights stress, helps to relax and reminds you that life is more than just work. Even if it feels strange at first, make it a point to smile more often.

, This is really a visualization technique, in which you imagine that you are cocooned against the negative vibes of overly stressed people around you. See their behavior and attitudes for what they are, recognize what their stress is doing to them but refuse to let this penetrate your shield.


Don't carry the world's weight on your shoulders – these people are making a choice to behave in this way, and you don't have to come along for the ride.
De-linking yourself from others stress can be hard at first, especially if you are empathic by nature, but keep practicing until not giving in to their negativity becomes second nature.

, Put the phone back down, shut the email folder, walk away. Whenever you feel like making an instantaneous reply in anger to someone who has raised your ire, don't act on it. When we feel angry and stressed, we are more likely to read sinister interpretations into our interactions and if we act on them, our self-righteous anger can be self-fulfilling when the person responds negatively. Sleep on your angry missive and practice the relaxation techniques outlined here.


Write a draft of your response, and let it sit for a day. If everything in it is just as true and valid to you 24 hours later, consider sending it. If not, you'll be grateful you held off.
Walk away and decompress. Instead of acting in anger, remove yourself from the situation until your calm has returned.

, Spend less time with people who try to guilt you into doing things or tell you that you're not good enough. Yes, even if they're family.


Steer clear of people who are constantly complaining or miserable, aka ""negaholics"". Stress can be contagious, so avoid transmitters. Understand that there is always a solution to a problem, even if they don't, or won't, see that.
Avoid people who practice the art of woundology (and avoid practicing it yourself!). Wallowing in misery is an art form for some people. You don't need their negativity, nor their rapacious need for making the worst of every situation.

, Go on the positive offensive and reach through to people who seem down and negative. Caring touch reduces stress and promotes relaxation. Say hello and goodbye to your friends and family members with a hug, and don't be afraid to comfort someone with a hug, or ask for a hug when you're feeling overwhelmed.

, If you value your relationships, as do most people, it can be challenging to realize that there are people who are just too toxic or too needy to keep in your inner circle because they sap your energy and stress you constantly. Sometimes it's best to let go, provided you do so after thinking it through carefully. Avoid being judgmental, hurtful, or blunt; just move on as you need to. The following articles might help you work out what could be wrong with a relationship that's getting you down, and what to do about it:

You can try lifting some weights, riding a bike, or even playing a game of basketball. Then, use your meditation time to decompress.;
, Find a count that works for you and then repeat it over and over again in time with your breaths. Breathe in for four counts and then breathe out for four counts. Make sure that your lungs inflate fully and try to remove all air from them with every exhale. Repeat this process for a few minutes until you feel calm and prepared to meditate., This is a tool that many people use to drift off into sleep; however, it also helps to relax your body for meditation. Pour some milk into a microwave-safe cup and heat it until warm. You can also heat the milk on the stove. Slowly sip the milk.

, Find a quiet, calm place and lie down for 30 minutes. Try not to exceed this time limit or your nap may make you more tired than focused. Once you wake up, take a few minutes to stretch before starting to meditate. Your nap can serve as a restart for your day and may lessen your stress levels.


Taking naps during the day results in headaches for some people. If this is the case for you, experiment with the lengths of your naps or just try closing your eyes for a bit instead.

, Choose a type of tea that you prefer, whether it be peppermint, chamomile, or another option. Blend a cup and breathe in the steam. Slowly sip the tea. Some teas, such as chamomile, have built-in low-level sedation properties which can lead to almost immediate relaxation.For even more relaxing results, you can pair your tea with a warm bath. Just make sure to not get too relaxed or you may feel tempted to skip your meditation exercises.

, At least 15 minutes before you start to meditate, put on some clothes that are not distracting to you. Go with natural blends, such as cotton. Synthetic fabrics can be scratchy and less flexible. Making clothing adjustments can pull you out of your meditation.


Some people prefer to wear something similar to workout attire. Try fitted or loose cotton pants with a matching t-shirt. You can also go shoeless for even more comfort.

, Sit still and consider each part of your body, starting with the top of your head and moving downwards. Pay attention to how each area feels. Are you experiencing any pain there?

Don't rely on it for a hangover.,
Contact your doctor with stomach symptoms.",How to Gain Potential Health Benefits from Activated Charcoal3," Activated charcoal keeps your body from absorbing certain things. Therefore, if you take it with your normal medication, you may not actually absorb any of it. Make sure to wait at least 2 hours after taking activated charcoal to take any of your medications., Some people swear by activated charcoal for a hangover. However, charcoal doesn't actually bind with alcohol, so it doesn't do much for a hangover. The alcohol will just stay in your body., If you notice that you have pain in your stomach after taking charcoal, call your doctor soon. Swelling in the stomach is another rare side effect that requires medical attention.Less serious side effects include diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting, which don't necessarily need medical attention, though you should stop using the activated charcoal.

Make a gratitude list.,
Write down a to-do list.,
Turn off and put away your phone.,
Read from a calming text.,
Focus on one thing.,
Be gentle with yourself.",How to Clear Your Mind for Meditation2," Pick a particular person in your life. Then, focus on that person and write down everything that you are grateful for about them. Try to write down at least ten observations. Repeat this process with a new “person of focus” each day immediately prior to meditating. This will put you in a positive mindset.If you want to extend the positive energy even more, you can send your list to the person in question.

, If you are the type of person who is extraordinarily busy, set aside five minutes before each meditation to sit down and write out a list of tasks that you need to complete that day or week. Once they are on the list, do your best to banish them from your mind. You now know that they will be dealt with after you are finished.This is also a good way to not feel guilty about taking some “me” time for meditation. Your list shows that you will handle your obligations to others as well.
As opposed to a list, you can also just free-write your thoughts. Write anything that comes to mind. You can use this as a way to vent any negative energy too. For example, you might write, “I’m so tired to being taken for granted at work.”, As you start the winding down process, go ahead and place your phone away from you and silence it. Your phone has the potential to distract you and to pull you back into the current day’s events. Removing your phone allows you to escape for a bit.If you are meditating with a group, it is also common courtesy to silence all electronic devices, unless the group decides otherwise.

, Carry a small book of poems with you. Or, perhaps a book with inspirational quotations. Some people find reading biographies calming as well. There are even special meditation books available that can help you to focus your thoughts. Go to your local bookstore, or online, and search out a few texts that appeal to you., Picture in your mind one person, place, event, idea, or location. It can be anything that you choose. Push all of your mental energies toward that area and try to focus on it as much as possible. Go back to this area whenever your mind tries to wander when meditating.


For example, you might focus on how much you love the city of Paris. Try to think about everything that you love about it and then steer yourself back to a blank mind.

, It’s okay to engage in a dialogue with yourself while preparing to mediate. If you begin to lose focus, tell yourself, “Let’s avoid distractions. Focus on breathing.” If you start to attack yourself for being “bad” at meditating then you will lose all focus and control. So, keep your mental comments positive and uplifting.When in doubt, assume that you are doing everything right. After all, if you get something out of meditating, then you’ve succeeded."

It may calm your mind knowing that your environment is orderly.

, If you are too cold, then you will likely lose focus and your mind may wander a bit. You may also fidget or experience the chills, which are equally distracting.

, Many people prefer to sit on the floor to meditate, sometimes with their feet crossed. However, you can also try sitting with your legs stretched out, sitting upright in a chair, laying down on your back or on your stomach, or even walking around. Rotate through these positions until you find one that works best for clearing your mind.If you choose to sit down to meditate, it might help to add a soft towel or light blanket to sit on.

, Create a calming atmosphere by installing dimmer bulbs in your meditation haven area. Or, turn off the lights in the room and light a few small candles. If you find yourself getting distracted, focusing on the flame will help to center you.

, When you are finished with a session, don’t just jump up and immediately throw yourself back into your work. Instead, stand up and take a long, relaxing stretch. Maybe take another short walk. Gradually build-up to your normal level of activity., Make meditation a normal part of your daily routine. It is easiest to clear your mind in the morning, but a daytime or evening session are also good options. Stick to the same general timeframe, so that your mind and body get used to the process."

Let someone else do it for you.,
Start meditating.,
Sleep in as often as possible.,
Abandon the concept of a career.,
Stop obsessing over money.,
Cut your hours at work to as few as possible.,
Get a job that isn't ""work."",
Take as many days off as possible.,
Move to a place that celebrates leisure activities.",How to Be Idle," Running kids to soccer practice, taking dogs for a walk, and taking on extra projects at work aren't the activities of an idler. Cloud-watching? Meditating? Drinking tea? Now we're talking. Identify the things that you enjoy doing the most, regardless of whether or not culture views them as ""productive.""


What would you do if money were no object? Design the perfect version of your day. When would you wake up? What would you do first? What will you have done before lunch time? List out your major priorities in life.
What could you do now, today, to make these things happen more easily? If you want to be able to sit and drink coffee and read the paper, undisturbed, could you do this? What's keeping you from getting the idle time you want?;
, Helping your friend move, staying late at the office, taking time out to help the neighbor paint the house? Saintly activities, no doubt, but this kind of stuff seriously cuts into idle time that you may desperately need. Do what you need to do, and continue being reliable for necessary chores, activities, and responsibilities, but stop volunteering for extra stuff.


Increasingly, especially with social networking updates and instant-gratification media, we like to glorify busyness as a culture. There's nothing wrong with making a commitment to saving time back for nothing at all. You don't need to have any reason to want to sit in a chair, have a glass of wine, and stare into the middle distance. That's how we stay sane.

, For some people, a tightly-organized schedule is an essential part of productivity and feeling a sense of accomplishment in the day. For others, it's like a lead weight that hangs around your neck. Who says you have to eat lunch promptly at 12:15, and that it must take exactly 30 minutes, and that you must be back to work by 12:45? Eat when you're hungry. Toss your schedule in the garbage.


Stop wearing a watch, if it stresses you out more than it helps you stay on time. Let yourself stay productive by your own internal workflow, not the little ticks on the clock face.
In some languages, conceptions of the way time works are much different. A schedule of hours, from ""lunch time"" to ""coffee break"" can be constructed by the language we speak. It's artificial. Tuvans, for example, conceive of the future as behind us, because we can't see it, and that we're walking backward into it.Point being, it's OK to think about the ""value"" of time differently.

, Cellphones, social media, and high-speed internet have a way of seriously cutting into idle time. Try to pull back from social media a little bit, and learn to unplug. The ""fear of missing out,"" is an increasingly serious phenomenon.When once you could sit with your thoughts and idle on your way to work, now you have the whole world at your fingertips, from the Kardashians to the Klingons, right on your phone. Your high school friend's marriage pictures. Fifty work e-mails. Someone you met one time in Florida's most recent relationship humble brag. Are these really important parts of your day, right at this moment? Make yourself less available and idle more.


In many ways, technology helps us to use our time more wisely. Get in the habit of answering emails right away, so you won't have to worry about responding to them later, cutting into your idle time. If you miss a text, big deal. People shouldn't expect you to be on call 24-7.

, Ambition gets in the way. The desire for lots of money, a ""successful"" career, and even things like fame and recognition do a lot to keep us unhappy, disappointed, and turn us into mindless workaholics. Stop feeding your ego and start feeding your idle. Make happiness and leisure your biggest goal and let the other things drift away.


Some psychologists will refer to a ""locus of control."" Some people have an external locus, meaning that they seek approval from others, while some people have an internal locus, meaning that they only seek the approval of themselves.Be happy making yourself happy, not working to get the recognition of others. If what you want to do is drink a bottle of beer and watch the sun set, then you have a responsibility to drink a bottle of beer and watch the sun set. Hop to it.

, Bob Dylan claims to have written ""Blowin' in the Wind,"" a song that stands in for an entire decade and cultural moment in most historical documentaries, in five minutes. Even if he did nothing else for the rest of his life but eat lunches, drink wine, and watch monster movies, that would have been a productive day. As the French say, ""Travailler moins, produire plus."" Translation: the less you work, the more you make.


While it might sound strange, making yourself be super-productive for short periods of time will leave you with more time to be idle. Steal time by packing super-attentive hard work into half the day, then kick back and stay on the clock for the rest of the time.
Learn to focus on one thing only. Don't try to spread your talents and efforts all over the place at once. Put all of yourself into one thing and finish it as best as you can, then put it away entirely and forget about it. You'll be more productive with the time you have.

, Any good idler knows that the best person for the job is probably someone else. When the teacher asks for volunteers, look at your desk. When the project manager needs an enterprising young talent to spearhead the new project, keep your hands in your pocket. There's no point in letting artificial ideas about ambition and ""success"" get in the way of your valuable leisure time. If idleness is important to you, keep your ego in check and let other people grab the gold ring.


The difference between idleness and laziness is that an idle person can take care of themselves, and a lazy person requires the assistance of others. To be truly idle, you need to be in control of your own life, able to do things, but choosing not to. In other words, if you're 32 and living in your dad's basement watching cartoons and eating cereal for three meals a day, you can't chalk that up to idleness. That's just being lazy. Provide for yourself, commit to your own happiness, and stop being a burden on others.

, Meditation can do a lot to calm your stresses, center your self, and refocus your energy on your mind. Any good idler spends most of their time daydreaming in headspace anyway, so meditation should come as natural. You don't need to be a samurai or some kind of monk to meditate. It's not complicated.


Find a comfortable sitting position. An upright chair is fine, or on the floor in the full lotus position is fine, there's no perfect way to meditate, despite what anyone says. Sit upright, fold your hands in your lap comfortably, and just sit. That's it. Focus on your breath, watching your thoughts go by like fish in a pond. Don't be your thoughts, watch them. Let them go.
Zazen, the principle practice of zen meditation, literally means ""just sitting."" There's no secret, or mystical component to sitting meditation. You're just sitting. If that's not idle behavior, nothing is.

, John Keats, one of the most famous lyrical poets who ever lived, once said that a poet had a responsibility to sleep in every day until at least 10 am. Waking up at the crack of dawn is the behavior of an ambitious person, not an idler. There's no need to grab the day by the dawn-horns. Let yourself ease into the day gradually by sleeping in and getting up when it feels like you're ready to be up.


Go to sleep when you feel like sleeping. Nap when you feel like napping. No sense in a schedule, remember?

, A career is like a stack of imaginary dominos guarded by invisible gatekeepers. Supposedly, if you knock over this one, it might knock over these other ones, which will end up giving you a lot of money, a sexy spouse, and some kind of car that goes real fast. Yeah right. Don't concern yourself with the idea of a career, with doing work now that will maybe, perhaps, hopefully pay off ten years down the road. Focus on today. Focus on this minute. Focus on the now.

, Money keeps you from getting what you want. It's an excuse. Every failed musician who ever lived looked at expensive gear and said, ""Oh, if only I had that 8 track, I could make the music I wanted."" If only you had that vacation house your boss has, or the trust fund your college roommate has, or that resume that your friend has, then you'd be successful. Nothing is keeping you from getting what you want but you., Figure out your basic costs and figure out how much you can do to make the money you need to make, providing for yourself without having to do more than what's necessary. Don't spend money on silly material goods, or status grabbing brand names. Spend only on the essentials.


Figure out the essentials and live a more spartan existence. Leonard Cohen, the famous singer, would spend a few months in Canada writing stories for magazines before he was famous, crashing on couches, saving all the money he made so he could live cheaply in Greece for the rest of the year, idling. Seems like a good deal.

A good budget is helpful for an idle life. Learn to spend less on extra things and save your money for maintaining a comfortable life without having to work too hard for it.

, Depending on your talents, skills, and abilities, a number of different jobs might be available to you. No one can be a bump on a log 24-7, but learning to find work doing the most enjoyable and least work-like work possible will help you to feel as if you're idling at all times.


When you decide how you'd spend your ideal day, what did you say? If you'd love to be reading, consider developing your skills as a copyeditor, writer, or content creator. If you'd love to be drinking coffee all day, get a job as a barista. If you'd love to be walking around the woods, go into wildlife management. Spend your time doing what you love and it won't be work.
Leave that work at work. When you're at home, be at home. When you're at work, be at work. Don't waste time you could be idling thinking about work, or talking about work, or certainly not doing any work.

, Americans typically leave somewhere in the neighborhood of 400 million vacation days unused every year.That's 400 million days that could have been used to rest, restore, and focus on yourself, that instead went into labor for someone else. If you've got vacation available to you, take it.


Again, don't glorify busyness. If you've got a week off, who says you've got to schedule a stressful trip to the other side of the world? If that doesn't sound like a vacation, spend the day at home, sleeping in, drinking coffee, and doing what you want. Relax. Be idle.

, It's true that some places treat the concept of idleness differently, and are more receptive to spending long lunches drinking in cafes, taking afternoon siestas on the beach, or cutting out of work to do other things for the day. If you're seriously committed to being an idler, consider uprooting yourself, or at least visiting other cultures that take idleness seriously.


Denmark is consistently rated as the country with the highest happiness index, which means that more people consider themselves happy there than anywhere else in the world. Not coincidentally, the Danes work less than 40 hours a week, take twice as much vacation as in the States, and have a large infrastructure of social welfare benefits available based on taxes."

Exhale as you bend your elbows straight behind you so that they are touching the sides of your body.,
To release, gently lower your body to rest on the ground.",How to Do the Four Limbed Staff Pose in Yoga," Before you begin, you should have an introductory understanding of yoga and its benefits. You should generally view yoga as more than just a series of stretches and poses; it is also meant to inspire a high level of consciousness in the practitioner.;
, The Four Limbed Staff pose is part of a broader sequence known as the sun salutation. This series is designed to energize your body for the new day and awaken your mind. Approach this pose with a clear mind; you are supposed to open yourself up to the possibilities of the new day.

, Yoga should never make you feel like you are in pain. While your muscles might be flexed and tested, you should never feel like you have ripped or pulled a muscle. If you start to feel sharp pain or a pinching sensation, stop the exercise.

, The four-limbed staff position is a relatively advanced yoga pose. You have to have a strong set of core muscles in order to practice it successfully.


If you cannot hold this pose, you can consider substituting in the Cobra Pose or the Locust Pose, which strengthen a similar set of muscles but don't put as much pressure on your core., You will need a place where you can fully extend into a plank position. Use a yoga mat in order to protect your joints from the hard surface of the floor.


If you are in a crowded space, such as a packed yoga class, make sure you have enough room to hold the pose. You will need the entire length of the mat.

, This position will prepare your transition to the plank-like position of pose. It will also give you time to adjust to to horizontal position of the pose.

As you move your legs backward, be sure to push your chest forward with the same amount of force. If you do not balance your weight between your chest and your legs, this will throw off your alignment.You might be tempted to stick your tailbone up to the ceiling or to dip your lower back down to the floor. Avoid doing this as it will disrupt your alignment. Instead keep your tailbone tucked in so you are properly centered above the ground.

, Your body should be parallel to the ground. Pull your belly button up towards your spine. Keep your shoulders parallel with your elbows.


Tuck your chin in slightly so your head and neck are aligned with your torso.
Make sure your arms do not stick out, perpendicular to your body. This will put an inappropriate amount of stress on your neck.
Try to hold the post for 10-30 seconds in order to fully strengthen and develop your muscles.

, Lay your arms out by your sides and rest for several breaths.

After 5 to 10 breaths, uncross your arms and then repeat the process.For the ""Child's Pose,"" kneel on your mattress. Make sure your big toes are touching but separate your knees so they're as far apart as your hips. Move your head forward until it's between your thighs. Stay in the pose for as long as your feel comfortable.The ""Pigeon Pose"" is a somewhat more advanced pose, so unless you've been doing yoga for a bit you might want to hold off. However, if you're experienced in yoga it can be a great way to stretch your legs. Keeping your hands shoulder distance apart, stand on all fours. Then, move your right knee between your hands, allowing your outer right leg to rest on the mattress. Stretch your left leg backwards so your foot is lying flat on the mattress. Stay in the pose for as long as is comfortable. Then, switch the position of your legs."

Set up your planking space.,
Dress for planks.,
Start on all fours to open up your spine.,
Move your body into the plank pose.,
Find a balance.,
Hold the pose.,
End the pose when you are done.",How to Do the Plank Pose1," You can do the plank pose almost anywhere, as long as you have a place to rest your toes and hands/elbows. If you are planking on the ground, make sure that the area is clean and flat. Consider the texture of your planking space: hard, rough surfaces may be less gentle on your hands/elbows, but you may find it harder to keep your balance on a surface that is too soft. Try planking on a rug or a yoga mat so that your elbows have something firm but forgiving to rest upon.;
, Wear loose or stretchable clothing like shorts, sweats, or yoga pants. Your top should be slightly fitted as well. A baggy top may get in the way of you assuming the proper position. If you plan to do the plank pose at the gym or another public space, be sure to dress with flexibility in mind before you leave the house.


You can do this pose with or without shoes. However, avoid wearing only socks so that your feet do not slide around.

Round your spine by lifting your belly, dropping your head and rear, and rolling your shoulders forward.Repeat these movements back and forth a few times to lengthen your spine and open yourself to the stretch. If you are incorporating planks into a yoga routine, this is a traditional way to enter the pose.
Alternately, lay prone (stretched out flat on your belly) on the floor. If you do not want to start on all fours, you can start prone and push yourself up into the plank position.

, Keep your legs extended, your shoulders broad, and your head forward. Hold yourself squarely off the floor with your toes and palms. If you started on all fours, slowly tuck your toes and step back with your feet. Bring your body and your head into one straight line. If you started prone, slowly raise yourself into a basic push-up position., Keep your thighs lifted. Your body should not curve, but rather should form a straight and balanced line. Be careful not to let to let your hips sink. Align your body so that your shoulders are directly above your wrists, and hold it there.Contract your abs to draw your pelvic muscles toward your spine. Keep your head in line with your spine. Keep your shoulders broad for balance.
Press the front of your thighs (quadriceps) up toward the ceiling. Stretch your legs out as far as they will comfortably go.
Focus on your palms as they root you to the floor. Keep your hands pressed flat.

, Take deep, measured breaths. If you are incorporating the pose into a yoga flow, hold it for five smooth breaths and then transition into the next position. If you are using planks to build strength and stamina, hold the pose for as long as you can. Focus on perfecting your form and getting the most out of your planks.


If you are a beginner, try holding the plank for 15 seconds. Build up to holding the plank for 30-60 seconds.If you are not a beginner, hold the plank for 60 seconds and then take a short break. Try to do 3 or 4 rounds.
As you improve, gradually increase the amount of time. One minute; two minutes; three minutes; as long as you can hold it. Alternate your planks with variations if you want a balanced workout, or hold the pose for as long as you like.
If you don't want to involve a stopwatch in your practice, count breaths instead. Count each breath as you draw it in and let it out. Try to hold for 5 - 15 breaths., Transition to another yoga position, return to your hands and knees, or lay down again to rest, prone. If you are no longer able to hold the proper form (e.g. hips begin to sag) go ahead and end the pose.The plank is not effective if you are not in the correct position. You also do not want to injure yourself by having bad form.

Slowly move your head to the floor and move your arms out straight in front of you., The mountain pose is a simple pose that people of any size can comfortably do. It will not only help you improve your flexibility, but also help you relax. Start by positioning yourself on a yoga mat in a relaxing location.


Stand straight up and space your legs apart slightly. Make sure you feel stable and balanced.
Make sure your legs, shoulders, and torso are relaxed.
Inhale deeply and slowly raise your hands so they're over your head. Keep your fingertips straight and pointed upward.
Your palms should wind up facing each other and your arms should be straight., One of the big drawbacks about being overweight is decreased flexibility. As a result, you need to make sure not to force any positions when doing a yoga move. If you force a position, you might injure yourself and undermine the whole point of practicing yoga.


Don’t complete a movement if you experience any sort of pain.
Stop immediately if you experience serious discomfort.
Make sure to differentiate healthy muscle stretching from dangerous discomfort., While you may be tempted to keep a pace set by someone else, you should adapt the exercise or routine so you can set your own pace. By setting your own pace, you’ll challenge yourself without putting yourself in danger.


Adjust any ready-made routines you decide to adopt. For instance, if you plan to use a 30-minute yoga workout routine, you may need to lengthen it to 45 minutes. Don’t worry, though, you’ll likely be able to get it down to 30 minutes over time.
Rest whenever you need to. For instance, if you feel winded after completing several poses, take as much time as you need to recover before continuing on to the next pose., Because your balance is different than average weight people, you may need to take a wider stance to balance yourself. Ultimately, taking a wider stance will help you stabilize yourself and prevent potential injury.


Adjust the stance of a specific pose. For instance, if a pose requires you to separate your feet by a foot, consider widening the stance so you can balance and hold yourself up better.
Talk to a yoga trainer or teacher about how you can alter individual exercises, poses, or routines so you can stabilize yourself without hurting yourself., Many yoga experts recommend that people who are overweight should focus on doing as many poses on the floor as they can. This way, rather than working against gravity, you’ll be working with it.


Talk to a yoga trainer or teacher for a list of poses in which you can work on the floor.
Some floor-based poses include the child’s pose, Savasana pose, the bound angle pose, the wind relieving pose, and the half wind pose., Fundamentally, yoga is just as beneficial – if not more – for overweight people than normal weight people. Yoga can have a number of positive effects for overweight people, including:


increased general health
improved mood
lowering lipid levels
Reducing weight, There are a variety of safety considerations to take when thinking about doing yoga while being overweight. If you’re not safety-focused, yoga might do more harm than good.


Consider pre-existing medical conditions. For example, if you have a heart condition or a skeletal-muscular problem, you should be extra cautious of yoga.
Never push yourself beyond your abilities. If you know you can do intense cardio exercise for 20 minutes at a time, use that as your baseline for advancing your abilities.
Discontinue any yoga, aerobic, or fitness routine if you feel any pain.
Consult your doctor if you have any pains when practicing yoga., While yoga is a useful tool for overweight people, you should commit to a yoga routine in conjunction with a cardio routine. This is important, as yoga and a cardio routine will reinforce each other. In the end, you’ll be more fit, agile, and relaxed.


Consider performing 20 to 30 minutes of cardio every day.
Good exercises include powerwalking, running, swimming, cycling."

Choose a hand position.,
Keep your back straight.,
Close your eyes and turn your gaze inward.,
Return to sitting on the floor with your legs extended.",How to Do the Perfect Pose in Yoga2," There are three basic options for how to hold your hands:


Rest your hands on your thighs. Palms can be facing up or down.
Put your palms together over your heart center in the prayer position.
Rest your hands palms up on your knees. Make a circle with each index finger and thumb.

, Imagine that your spine is connected to a thread that is being pulled up from the crown of your head.

, Hold the pose for one minute.

, Slowly lie down and close your eyes. Rest there for up to five minutes.

"
"
Plank with your elbows on the floor.,
Plank on your knees.,
Try the side plank.,
Try single-leg planks.",How to Do the Plank Pose2," Try this version of the plank if you are not yet strong enough to do a full plank. Keep your legs in the push-up position, shift your weight to your forearms. One by one, bend your elbows and rest them on the floor in front of you. Hold the pose just like you would if you were planking on your hands.


This modification is suitable if you have carpal tunnel syndrome. It puts less pressure on your wrists., This is a much easier version of the plank, so if you're just getting started or you find the standard plank too challenging, this is a good modification. Doing a plank with your knees bent is also beneficial for those with shoulder pain,and can also put less stress on your lower back.


Keep your spine neutral by looking at a spot slightly ahead of you on the mat.Keep your abs tight and your body in a straight line.

, This version will really work your obliques — the side muscles of your core. It also improves balance, stability, and will engage your upper body more than a standard plank.Lie on your side with your legs extended, your feet stacked. Prop your body up on your elbow or, for a greater challenge, on your hand with your arm extended and holding your body weight. Keep your body in a straight line, your core engaged.


Keep your head in line with your spine by looking straight ahead. Your hip should not be tilted towards the floor/mat in this position. If you feel your hip sinking, adjust your form.If you are having difficulty holding this position, unstack your feet and cross the upper leg in front of your body.To make the position more challenging, raise the upper leg or arm in the air and hold.If you are having difficulty holding this position, unstack your feet and cross the upper leg in front of your body.Try alternating side planks with standard planks or elbow planks. For instance: one minute of elbow planks, one minute of left-side planks, one minute of elbow planks, one minute of right-side planks, and one more minute of elbow planks.

, Single-leg planks are more challenging and cause your body to work harder — instead of supporting your body in four places (both feet and hands or elbows in a standard plank), you will support your body in only three places (one foot and both arms), reducing your stability. Begin in a standard plank position, then raise one leg toward the ceiling. Don't allow your body or hips to turn — you should remain parallel to the floor. Hold for 20 seconds, then switch to the other leg.

Avoid collapsing your lower back.,
Do not push your rear toward the sky.,
Keep your neck straight, and do not let your head drop.,
Remember to breathe.,
Focus on form, not time.",How to Do the Plank Pose3," When you let your rear dip, you compromise the stability of your lower back, and can end up really hurting yourself. To correct this, you need to engage your core, pulling your bellybutton toward your spine.Keeping you head down will also help you keep your back in alignment.


Consider asking a friend to lay a broomstick or yardstick on your back. Having an objective reference may help you keep your pose straight. The top of the stick should touch your head, and the bottom of the stick should rest between your buttocks. The stick should rest between your shoulder blades., This is the opposite problem of collapsing your lower back — you are lifting your butt too high, which does not engage your core. Again, the solution is keeping your core tight. Pull your bellybutton in toward your spine, keeping your back in a flat, straight line.If your plank looks like the downward dog yoga pose, you need to drop your butt until your back is straight., The positioning of your head and neck may seem like a minor detail while you're struggling to keep your core engaged, but you risk injury and strain to your neck if you let your head droop. Instead of allowing it to hang, focus on a spot on the matt or floor that is between your hands but about a foot out in front of you., You may find yourself holding your breath as you struggle to hold the plank position. But forgetting to breathe while exercising can cause dizziness and nausea.Be intentional about your breathing as you hold the pose.

, Your form and focus are more important than the length of your planking session. When you can no longer hold your form, it’s time to stop.If you are compromising your form, you are no longer receiving the full benefit of the exercise, and you may end up injuring yourself.

,
Remember it is not the event that causes the stress but the reaction of the mind to the event.",How to Use Yoga to Reduce Stress in Your Life," Change it seems is the only certainty. The Western world is undergoing enormous change economically, socially and politically, and along with this change comes anxiety and a reluctance to accept ‘the inevitable’. Why? Because we have been accustomed to enjoying a particular life style and the ‘freedom’ that money can buy.;
, Now we are being challenged symbolically in a way that has not been seen since perhaps the civil war. As Pluto made its transit once again over Thanksgiving, it retraced a cyclical patterning that lasts around 17 years promising transformation and change away from the status quo. Many of us have not in this lifetime experienced this intensity before that is linked to fear. Fear of what we have and may lose, or fear of what we don’t have and want. As it grows, it breeds anger and resentment in people that wrecks havoc emotionally, within the individual and those that surround them.

, Even if we look back a mere ten years to the technological advances that have been made in that time, it is truly amazing. On many levels our lives are easier, for example paying bills online and accessing all kinds of information at the push of a button, yet there are always two sides of a coin. The vast array of technological advances do not seem to satiate mans’ innate desire to want more, and time that could be saved is gobbled up with computer games and a host of other distractions.

, Un-checked, it can lead to buildups of toxic waste that can erupt into stress, anxiety or some form of disease. The desire for wanting more has resulted in millions of people who have built incorrect breathing patterns that don’t eliminate all the carbon dioxide from the body. We are living off of the borrowed next breath in the same way that we as a society are living off borrowed credit. The reality of that is beginning to sink in at this time of change and the entire household will be affected by any emotionality this brings.

, We live more in our minds than anything and so it is important to feel like we are in control and have everything we want……. even if we don’t. For this we need to be content and create a lifestyle that is harmonious. A tranquil environment is a good investment. I used to say that breathing correctly is the main area that we need to focus on. Now however I believe we need to create a lifestyle that supports any techniques or practices we chose to adopt. Simplifying one’s life and being mindful of what we take in through the senses is a powerful technique long term because we can become much more aware of the emotional thought patterning that the mind generates and know that there is something beyond it. This is because we have made space to think the thought that we never had before and this gives us an opportunity to solve any problems we may be facing. Discernment is key also because we need to know what is poison for us and makes us feel threatened, resentful, fearful and angry.

,,,,, This may include things like taking a warm bath, reading, massage, restorative yoga, breathing techniques and meditation.

,, Change that and you eliminate the stress. Attitude is all.

Roll an object under your foot.,
Start in a natural standing position.,
Transition to mountain pose.,
Try tree pose.,
Give yourself a foot massage in bound angle pose.",How to Do Yoga for Heel Pain1," While rolling an object under foot isn't necessarily a pose or movement particular to yoga, it often is used in yoga classes that focus on feet. It's a good way to warm your feet up for further work increasing your awareness of your feet and how you use them.You don't need to buy any specific objects or sports equipment. You can use any sort of round, rollable object you have around the house, such as a water bottle or a rolling pin.
Sit down in a chair that enables you to place both feet flat on the floor. Put the object underneath one foot and slowly roll it from your heel to your toe and back.
Roll the object for about a minute, then switch and do the other side.;
, If you want to increase your awareness of your feet, you draw your attention to them while you are standing as you normally stand. Observe how your weight is falling on your feet, how your feet are positioned, and where there is any pain.Don't try to correct any issues – simply observe and note them. Rock back and forth, lifting your toes and then your heels, and observe how your feet feel as you do this.

, When standing in mountain pose you may feel as though you're just standing. However, after having observed yourself in a natural standing position, you should be able to tell the difference.To get into mountain pose, stand with your heels slightly apart but your big toes touching. Spread your toes wide and rock back and forth until your weight is spread evenly through all four corners of your feet.

Your neck should be straight with your head a straight line over the center of your pelvis. Hold your arms out to your sides, spread your fingers wide, and breathe deeply for 30 seconds to a minute.

, Provided you can maintain your balance, tree pose is an excellent way to strengthen your legs as well as relieve several foot problems including heel pain.

Reach down and grab your right ankle or foot with your right hand.
Pull your right foot up with your right hand, placing the sole of your foot against your left inner thigh or groin. Only go as high as you can without discomfort. Your toes should be pointed toward the floor.
Find your balance and rest your hands on the top of your pelvis. If you're not yet stable, you can keep your right hand on your right foot and stay centered that way.
Stand in tree pose for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply. Focusing your gaze on a spot a few feet in front of you on the floor will help you maintain your balance. Lower your right foot and repeat the pose with the other leg.

, Bound angle pose provides you an opportunity to give the soles of your feet a foot massage to relax and loosen the muscles in your feet, as well as stretching your hips, legs, and ankles.To get into bound angle, come to a comfortable seat on the floor with your legs extended.
Bend your legs at the knees so that the soles of your feet are touching in front of you. Grasp the arches of your feet with your hands and bend your elbows slightly.
Make sure your shoulders are rolled back and your spine is neutral. If you find you're hunched over or leaning too far back, you may need to use a rolled towel or blanket to support your pelvis.
On an exhale, bend forward to lower your chest toward your feet. Only go as far as is comfortable, stopping once you feel the stretch.
Breathe deeply in this position for 30 seconds to a minute, gently massaging the soles of your feet.

, Taken seriously, a little stretching exercise known as ""prancing feet"" can stretch the arch of your foot as well as increasing the flexibility of your toes and feet.Start this exercise from a standing position.

You also can do both feet at the same time, rolling onto your toes on one foot as you roll onto your heel with the other.

One of the main uses for yoga mats is to provide a safer, nonslip surface for you to practice your yoga poses.When you do yoga, your hands and feet often get sweaty and slippery. If you use a yoga mat, it provides a kind of sticky surface that your body can cling to and not slip.
This also allows you to lean more fully into a pose if you are not so preoccupied with slipping.;
, Yoga mats also provide you with a somewhat padded surface on which to perform your poses. This can help give a little cushion to those with injured backs or who aren’t quite able to do yoga on the hard ground.


The extra support of the yoga mat helps people with existing back injuries safely practice yoga, as well as aiding in the prevention of additional back injuries.

, The mat functions to create a kind of private space for the user, a space which others cannot infiltrate. In a yoga class, the bare floor is a public space that any person can walk on. But your yoga mat defines your private area in the context of this shared space., Yoga blankets are often placed on top of yoga mats to absorb any additional sweat and help prevent you from slipping. They also add a little extra cushion to soften the effects of the hard floor on your joints and muscles while doing certain poses.Roll up a blanket to give your back support during poses. It can also be used for underneath your neck. Try it at different thickness to determine which best suits your need. Vary the thickness of the blanket for the same pose to experience something different. You can use yoga blankets to help give you added support by rolling it or folding it into a certain needed size for various poses.

, Yoga straps and belts help you settle deeper into various yoga stretches and poses. Using these items can also help you improve your flexibility in general as well as your balance, especially while in certain yoga poses.They can also be used to hold your legs together so your feet do not slip during a pose where you need to keep your legs elevated and still.

, With yoga straps, you are able to grip both ends of the strap as it is wrapped around another part of your body to help you lengthen your stretch. Over time, you will no longer need the yoga strap. For example, if you are attempting the bow pose – on your stomach and pulling your legs up from behind you with your hands – but you can’t quite reach your legs, then you could use a yoga strap to help you reach and pull yourself into a deeper stretch., Yoga belts work in much the same way as yoga straps. The main difference is that a strap is open on both ends, while a belt is connected into a continuous circle.


The yoga belt can help you get into deeper stretches and improve flexibility, but it can also help you improve without requiring the use of both of your hands like a yoga strap. This often allows for a greater range of motion than with yoga straps.

, These yoga props are great for creating the kind of support and height you need to perform your poses safely. They also help you achieve the necessary body alignment in your posture that contribute to safe and effective poses.If you are struggling to maintain the correct posture for certain poses, you may want to consider purchasing a yoga block or bolster.

, Yoga blocks are firm and don’t reshape to your body. As such, they are more supportive, but less comfortable. They help you stretch and support your muscles and limbs. Yoga blocks allow you to position your body at the right level for each pose you wish to attempt.Take advantage of blocks to help support a part of your body while practicing yoga. They can help elevate a leg or brace your arm should you need help with balance. Blocks, chairs, and counters are especially beneficial for more complex poses or if you have physical limitations.
For example, if you use a yoga block to raise your hips while in seated poses – like Sukhasana, or Easy Pose – this will allow your spine to maintain the natural curves of the body and help you keep the proper posture for the pose.

, Yoga bolsters are made of dense fibers (like thick pillows) that alter their shape according to the pressure placed on it by your body. This means it is less firm and supportive than a yoga block, but it will still give you added support when you are attempting difficult yoga positions.For example, you can lay flat on your back and place the bolster directly under your chest, just below your shoulders. Your shoulders should hang off the edge of the bolster. Place your arms out on either side of you. This will help open up your chest, ribs, and stomach.

, It can definitely get expensive buying all the needed equipment for a workout routine – and yoga is no different. If you don’t have all the yoga props you need to practice, try using everyday household items instead.You can use a thick hardcover book instead of a yoga block. You can use a regular thick blanket instead of a yoga blanket. You can use a chair or a wall to help you settle more deeply into your poses.

Release tension in your hips with a figure four.,
Build leg strength with chair pose.,
Stretch hamstrings and calves with a forward fold.,
Use low lunges to strengthen the front and back of your legs.",How to Do Yoga for Heel Pain3," The reclined leg stretch is a relatively easy stretch for your hamstrings, which can cause heel pain when they are tight. If your hamstrings are at all related to your heel pain, this stretch may help.To do this exercise you'll need an exercise band or strap, or you can use a rolled towel. Lie on your back with your legs extended together. Bend your right knee towards your chest so you can loop the strap or towel around the arch of your right foot.
On an exhale, extend your right leg straight up. Lengthen the back of your leg and ground your left leg into the floor.
Hold the stretch for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply. Then do the other side.

, The figure four is not itself a yoga pose, but the stretch is yoga-inspired. This stretch can help you open your heels, enabling you to distribute your weight more evenly to help reduce heel pain.To start the stretch, lie on your back on the floor with your knees bent at 90-degree angles. Cross your right leg so that your right ankle rests just above your left knee, then flex your right foot. Grasp your left thigh with both arms, threading your right arm through the triangle created by your legs.
Your hips, head, and spine should be flat on the floor, your neck relaxed. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds to a minute and then repeat with your left leg crossed over your right.

, The chair pose is one of the best yoga poses for beginners that will strengthen your ankles, thighs, and calves. Keep in mind that if you have heel pain, your calves or ankles likely are the cause, so strengthening them could relieve your pain.Enter chair pose from mountain pose, standing with your heels slightly separated and your big toes touching.
On an exhale, bend your knees as though you are coming to a seat in an invisible chair behind you. Make sure your knees are directly over your ankles so that your shins are perpendicular to the floor.
Your torso should form a right angle with the tops of your thighs. Keep your shoulders rolled back, with your shoulder blades tucked down your spine and your tailbone pointed toward the floor.
Hold the pose for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply.

, If you have heel pain, or any other pain in your feet, forward folds are some of the best ways to relieve your pain and prevent future problems, primarily because they stretch and strengthen the hamstrings and calves.You can do forward folds from either a standing or seated position. Hinge forward from your waist and fold over your legs, keeping your back neutral.
Only go as far as you can comfortably go and feel a stretch at the back of your knees. You can rest your hands on the floor, or on your shins or knees if you can't reach the floor.
If you can reach your feet, grasp your toes and pull up on them to give your arches a good stretch.

, Low lunges engage your whole body while also improving your balance, which will help you better distribute your weight on your feet.From a downward dog, lift one leg toward the sky and then crunch it forward between your hands on an exhale.
As you inhale, step the other leg behind you and reach up with your torso, opening your collarbones and lifting your sternum. Keep your neck long and your shoulders rolled back.
With every exhale, think of further deepening the lunge. Make sure your knee is over your ankle so that your shin is perpendicular to the floor.
Hold your lunge for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply, then return to downward dog and repeat with the other leg.

Know that there are some poses that can make your condition worse.,
Try to avoid downward facing dog pose.,
Do not do plank pose.,
Avoid dragonfly pose.",How to Use Yoga for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome2," These poses place pressure on your wrists, causing more tension to your medial nerve. This can cause your symptoms to return, including pain, tingling, and numbness in your hands.


If you would like to discuss your specific condition, and what positions you should avoid, contact a physical therapist that can work with you based on your specific symptoms.

, This pose looks similar to dolphin pose, except that it places stress on your wrists, rather than on your forearms. In downward facing dog, you extend your arms as well as your legs so that you rely on your hands, wrists and feet for support.

, This pose relies on the fact that you can plant your hands on the floor with your arms extended, supporting your body weight. This position places a lot of tension on your wrist, and can squeeze your median nerve, leading to a burning sensation in your hands and wrists.


This is also considered the push-up position.

, This pose involves sitting on a yoga mat and then brining your right foot to your right armpit, then turning to your left and planting both of your palms on the floor. From there, you lean your body forward, letting your right elbow rest on your left thigh, and you stand on both of your wrists so that your whole body weight is on your wrists.As such, it can greatly exacerbate symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.

From the website, you can find out about the organization's events and how to get involved.National yoga organizations also typically have information about recent events, as well as interviews with champions.
You may even be able to watch videos of recent competitions so you can learn more about the events and how each competitor is judged.;
, You should be able to find a calendar of events on the website of your national or regional competitive yoga organization. Events may include not only competitions, but also training and informational sessions.For example, the U.S. Yoga Federation has a calendar of nationwide events on its website, leading up to the annual national competition. You can view a list of events or check the calendar.
Check your local scene as well. If you've never attempted competitive yoga before and just want to try it out, you may be able to find an unaffiliated local competition or charity event that you can use to get your feet wet.

, Especially if you've never attempted competitive yoga before, take some time to familiarize yourself with the levels of competition and identify where new competitors should start.Typically you'll have local or regional competitions, with the winners going to the national competition. Depending on the population and interest in your area, there may be smaller, local events or additional intermediate competitions before you qualify for nationals.
If you're just starting out, you'll want to start at the lowest possible level of competition. This is usually a local or regional level, but in less populous regions you may start at the state level.

, Typically you must register as a competitor with your national organization before you can sign up for any affiliated events. Your national organization's website will have information on how to start the membership process.You may have to become a member of a state or regional organization as well before you can register for events. In some cases, state or regional membership may include national membership, or vice-versa. Check into both before you start the application process.
Typically you'll have to pay membership dues. For example, in the U.S. you must pay membership dues of $50 to register as a competing member of the U.S. Yoga Federation. Membership is seasonal, not annual.
Keep in mind that becoming a member of an organization typically does not automatically register you for any competitions.

, Once you've established the necessary memberships, you can begin the registration process for your first competition. From the national organization's event page, you should be able to get details on how to register for an event near you.Each event has its own eligibility requirements. Typically you must have practiced yoga for a specific length of time. You also may need a club or instructor to sponsor you.
For some events, you may be required to submit a video of yourself doing the compulsory postures or another list of postures. Those videos will be judged before you will be granted leave to register for the competition.
The national organization typically will have information for affiliated events. You may be able to register online, or you may have to contact a local chapter.

, Many national organizations have directories of yoga instructors who specifically assist practitioners interested in entering a yoga competition.For example, the US Yoga Federation has a directory on its website where you can search for coaches who are members of the federation and are located near you. You also can find profiles of former competitors who have started coaching.
Another way to find coaches is to look up competitors and find out who their coaches are. If you can watch videos of competitors, you can focus on those who have a style similar to yours to find coaches who might be a good fit for you.
You also might look for yoga studios or clubs that are members of your national or local competitive yoga organization. There typically will be instructors there who are interested in coaching competitors.

, Since there is no national or international certification process for yoga instructors, you need to research any coaches you find thoroughly – even if they are listed by your national competitive yoga organization.Look for an instructor who has logged many hours instructing and practicing yoga, and also has been involved in competitive yoga for a while. Ideally, you want someone who is a former competitor.
If you have the opportunity, try to talk to several students of anyone you're considering as a coach so you can learn more about their style and teaching or coaching methods. When you talk to the coaches, you may want to ask them for references.

, If there is more than one coach available in your area, you should talk to as many as possible so you can find the best one for you. Not only should coaching services fit within your schedule and budget, but you need to get along with the person you ultimately choose.Ask the coaches about their yoga practice, including how long they've been practicing yoga and when they started teaching or coaching. You also may want to find out what led them to become a coach or teacher and what called them to regular yoga practice.
When you're talking to the instructor, pay attention to how they make you feel. You should be comfortable and at ease with the person, or they probably won't be an effective coach for you.
You also need to be able to explain to any coaches you interview about your own yoga practice, your strengths and weaknesses, and what has drawn you to competitive yoga.

, Even after you've talked to a coach at length and researched their background, it's still a good idea to see if you can come in for a one-on-one session before you make your final choice. With even one session, you can learn more about the coach's style and whether you respond well to their instructions and adjustments.Make sure part of your initial training session includes the five compulsory postures that form the core of the competition. You can find out what these are by getting a copy of the competition rules for the event in which you plan to compete.
Keep in mind that the cost for individual training will depend on your location as well as how much training you need. After your first session, the coach should have recommendations for how much you should train and where your focus should be in the weeks or months leading up to the competition.
You typically can practice on your own, but you'll still need to have several sessions with your coach – especially early on – to correct bad habits before they become too engrained.

, The International Yoga Sports Federation (IYSF) has a lengthy set of rules that govern international competitions. National and regional organizations also may have their own rules that govern the competitions in which you want to participate.Make sure you have a copy of the rules for the competition for which you've registered. While the basics may be the same, there may be specifics that apply to specific events.
The competition rules cover everything from the postures and rules for judging to rules for competitors, including competition attire, conduct, and doping regulations.
Within the rules, you'll also find specific guidelines for the compulsory postures, including the specific elements that will be judged. Pay close attention to these and make note of anything that you need to improve with your training.
You also want to review the methods of scoring and deductions, particularly in light of your own strengths and weaknesses.

, If you have the opportunity, try to go to at least one competition as a spectator so you can become more familiar with the pace and flow of competition. This will help you have a better understanding of what to expect at your own competition.If you don't have the opportunity to watch a live competition in person before your own, go online and watch videos from past yoga competitions so you can get a better idea of the competition format and proceedings.

, Each competitor is judged on their form and ability to hold five compulsory postures, as well as two additional optional postures. The compulsory postures may differ depending on the event for which you've registered. Practicing all of these postures repetitively will ensure that you can complete them with grace and poise.You'll also need to choose your two optional postures. Depending on the competition, you may have to choose from a list, or you may have free reign to choose your own. In that case, you typically want to go with the postures that accentuate your strengths and which you enjoy doing the most.
Generally, you'll be judged on the quality of your form, as well as your strength, flexibility, and balance. Judges also will consider your grace, both within each posture and in transition to different postures.
Practice your competition postures every day. You want them to be second nature to you, as comfortable as sitting or standing.

, Even if you don't anticipate becoming a judge, if you're able to sign up for a judge's clinic it will give you a better understanding of how postures are judged and what the judges will be looking for.All judges typically must complete at least one judge's clinic before they are eligible to judge a live competition. Attending a judge's clinic can give you some additional insight into how postures are scored and why deductions are taken.
National and international competitive yoga organizations hold a number of judge's clinics each year. Additionally, you may be able to find a clinic taught online.
In addition to judge's clinics, competitive yoga organizations often hold webinars specifically for competitors that explains the rules and procedures for competitions more in-depth. One of these classes may answer any lingering questions you have about competitive yoga.

Sleep with your neck straight.,
Try skin-firming cream.,
Cover up with makeup.",How to Tighten a Turkey Neck With Facial Yoga2," This is a simple trick that can help keep your neck wrinkles from becoming more pronounced. When you sleep with your neck contorted to one side or the other, your skin is more likely to stretch and become loose. Try to sleep on your back with your neck straight instead., The skin on your neck is thinner than in other areas of the body, and it tends to dry out and wrinkle more quickly. Use a moisturizing lotion every day to keep it firm and elastic. If you want to give it an additional boost, try a skin-firming cream that contains retinol or an anti-wrinkle formula.This will help repair the skin and keep it looking young.


Apply cream using a gentle circular motion, working from the bottom of the neck toward the chin. Avoid pulling at your skin and dragging it down, since stretching it every which way could make matters worse.
In addition to cream, you should also wear sunscreen on your neck. Sun damage can lead to wrinkles and skin damage.

, This is a quick, nonsurgical option that will reduce the appearance of turkey neck. Just choose a foundation that matches your skin tone, mix it with a little moisturizing cream, and apply it to your neck. Evening out the skin will reduce the appearance of wrinkles and dark shadows that make loose skin look more pronounced. You could also cover up with a turtleneck, a high-collared sweater, or a scarf.

Attend yoga classes to become familiar with asanas and breathing.,
Choose a flat space that is at least 9 feet (2.7 m) by 9 feet (2.7 m by 2.7 m).,
Remove all clutter from the area.,
Cover your flat surface.,
Set up adjustable lighting.,
Control the temperature.,
Stock your studio with necessary yoga equipment.,
Set up a computer, TV or music speakers near your yoga mat, for easy viewing or changing.,
Keep water and a towel nearby.

,
Close the door, or block out distractions and begin your yoga practice.

",How to Set up a Home Yoga Studio," Asanas are the poses that you hold during a regular yoga session. If you do not attend classes for a few months, you may use improper postures that can be harmful to the body.;
, You can do yoga in a smaller space, but this size is ideal to hold all your equipment and not feel confined. There should be a stable wall nearby for shoulder stands and other inversions.

, Embrace minimalist design. You want to limit distractions and encourage concentration, and plain white walls may do just that.


Remove mirrors. Although many yoga studios have mirrors that helps students see their posture, if you have become familiar with yoga poses, the mirror will encourage distraction rather than introspection.

, You will need to adjust your cover depending upon your flooring.


If you have a hardwood floor, all you will need is a yoga mat, since hardwood floors are easy on the knees and hold warmth.
If you have a concrete floor, secure a flat rug on the floor and cover it with a yoga mat, or use 2 to 3 yoga mats. Concrete can be hard on the knees and too cold for the body, so you need an extra layer or 2 of protection.
If you have a carpeted floor, test it to see how soft it is. Extremely soft carpets may not provide enough stability. In that case, cover it with a finished wooden plank and then a yoga mat. If it is slightly thicker, it may provide enough grip to practice yoga without a mat.

, A dimmer is ideal, so that you can change the light depending upon the time of day you practice and turn it low when you are meditating or relaxing.


Put your yoga studio near a window, if you would like a lot of natural light in your studio. Make sure it does not let in too much distraction and noise.

, An added bonus of the home yoga studio is that you can decide what temperature you want to practice in. Some people believe a higher temperature, around 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius) may help your muscles, and other people like a room temperature setting to reduce sweating during their practice.

, A standard yoga mat is the only essential piece of equipment, since you are probably used to the feel of it during yoga class. However, you may also want to add a strap, foam blocks, bolsters, blankets or pillows to accommodate difficult postures.


Search for yoga practice kits, if you do not own this kit already. You can order all the equipment from 1 Internet store, if you don't have a yoga or sports supply store nearby.

, This is especially important if you plan to use videos or podcasts. Even if you do not need instruction, you may want to play soothing music for meditative purposes.

Set a different asana sequence for each session that targets your hips, thighs and lower back and is based on the four types of poses. This can challenge your muscles and help you reduce your hips.








You can begin your sequence with a short meditation or chanting to focus your thoughts.Your sequence should comprise the following pattern: warm up of sun salutations, standing poses, inversions, backbends, forward bends, and closing poses.;
, You do not have to be able to do every yoga asana in existence to reduce your hips. Mixing up different poses that can target and open the hips can strengthen your muscles, help keep your body from adapting to a routine, and assist in weight loss and reducing your hips.








Practice easier asanas first and challenge yourself with more difficult poses after you master basic ones.Do asanas from each type of pose in the following order: standing poses, inversions, backbends, and forward bends.You can add a twisting asana to soothe your spine between backbends and forward bends if you like.Consider varying how long you stay in each asana. You could flow through poses one day while holding them for 8-10 breaths on other days. This can help challenge your muscles., It is important to warm up your body before you start doing yoga that is targeted towards your hips. Doing a few rounds of sun salutations, or Surya Namaskar, can lubricate your joints and begin engaging the muscles around your hips.








There are three different variations of sun salutations. Do 2-3 rounds of Surya Namaskar A, B, and C to warm up. These different sun salutations can engage and condition your muscles, may help ensure a safe and more pliable practice, and could minimize your overall body fat.Surya Namaskar B is a good choice for reducing hips because it incorporates chair pose (uttkatasana), which can really target the muscles around your hips.
Try practicing a sun salutation between different asanas to challenge your muscles and build endurance., You do not have to be able to do every yoga asana in existence to have an effective daily practice or to build muscle and lose fat. Integrating and mastering asanas that strengthen and open your hip area can help you put together a practice that can challenge your muscles and may help you minimize your hips.








Make sure to start with easier asanas and move on to more difficult poses as you master basic ones., After you’ve warmed up with sun salutations, do one or two standing asanas, or postures, to start. From mountain pose to the warrior series, these asanas build strength, stamina and flexibility in your lower back, thigh, and hip area.








Always begin any yoga practice in tadasana, or mountain pose.Add other standing poses such as vrksasna (tree pose), uttkatasana (chair pose), and utthan pristhasana (lizard pose) to help open your hips from improved flexibility.The Warrior Series, which is known as Virabhadrasana I, II, and III, and anjaneyasana (low lunge) can help strengthen the muscles of your legs, butt, and hip area.As you progress, you can incorporate other standing poses such as Utthita Trikonasana (Extended Triangle Pose) can both strengthen and open your hips., Inversions are sometimes difficult, but they can help reduce your hips.From handstand to headstand, these asanas engage your lower back, butt, and leg muscles, and can also calm your circulation and stimulate your nervous system.








If you’re concerned about falling, ask for the help of a professional. This can help ensure that you enter the postures properly and don’t injure yourself.You can practice mukha vrksasana (handstand) on a wall until you have enough strength to hold yourself up.Gradually add forearm balance and salamba sirsasana (headstand) and pincha mayurasana (feathered peacock pose) as your practice improves.Never jump into any inversion. Too much momentum can lead to injury., Together with inversions, backbends comprise the most intense portion of any asana practice. From cobra pose to full wheel, backbends will strengthen and stretch the muscles surrounding the hips.








Try simple backbends such as aalabhasana (locust pose), bhujangasana (cobra pose), or setu bandha sarvangasana (bridge pose) before working up to dhanurasana (bow pose) and urdhva dhanurasana (full wheel or upward bow)., If your back needs soothing following backbends, neutralize your back with a twist. These asanas relieve tension and can aid flexibility in the hip area.








Ardha matsyendrasana (half lord of the fishes pose) or Parivrtta Trikonasana (Revolved Triangle Pose) are an excellent twisting asanas that open up your hips., You should always practice forward bends towards the end of a yoga session because they calm the mind and the nerves. From pigeon pose to star pose, forward bends will stretch and strengthen the muscles of the hips while and preparing you for closing postures and final relaxation.








Try paschimottanasana (seated forward bend), janu sirsasana (heat of the knee pose), gomukhasana (cow face pose), or tarasana (star pose). These asanas can stretch out the hips and help strengthen them. You may want to hold them each for 8-10 balanced breaths., Closing postures will end your active asana practice. From supported shoulder stand to corpse pose, these poses will quiet your mind and relax your body.








A good sequence to follow for closing postures is holding salamba sarvangasana (supported shoulderstand) and then immediately entering matsyasana (fish pose).These asanas will require you to engage your core and the muscles around your hips.
If you cannot do salamba sarvangasana, try viparita karani (legs up the wall pose)., You’ve successfully finished your active asana practice and now it’s time to relax. End your practice in savasana (corpse pose) and enjoy the benefits of your yoga session., Cycle through vinyasas between poses for added hip reduction. This is more difficult than simply holding asanas, but has the benefit of more strength training and stretching.


Starting in whichever asana you choose, lower your body or thrust your legs until you land in a four point staff pose, which is called chatturanga dandasana in Sanskrit.Your elbows should be close to your body and bent at a 90 degree angle. Make sure to keep the abs and back side of the body engaged. This is a difficult position and keeping these muscles working will make it much easier.From chatturanga dandasana, roll over your toes to an upward facing dog position, or urdhva mukha savasana. This will make it easier to transition to the next and your final position, downward facing dog.Use your flexed toes to roll over on to the backs of your feet. Keep your thighs engaged and off of the floor as you push your chest through your arms. Gently arch your back and look up at the ceiling.End in downward facing dog. You’ve reached the final pose and a well-earned rest, so exhale and roll back over your toes so that your body ends up in an inverted “V” shape, which is downward facing dog or adho mukha savasana. This position should feel calming and allow you to rest as you get deeper into the asana, or pose.Keep your palms pressing flat against the floor, your sitting bones lifted towards the ceiling, and your abs engaged.Inhale and exhale steadily for as many breaths as you like., Try extending the duration of your practice by holding each pose a bit longer, adding additional asanas and flowing seamlessly between the poses. Add new and more challenging poses as you are able.Many yoga classes are between 60 and 90 minutes, so you could set your practice around that length or attend a class at a studio.

, You may want to increase the intensity of your practice to help build strength and flexibility, burn calories and reduce fat around your hips. This can be done easily by holding each asana for varying times and by challenging yourself with more difficult asanas.









For example, poses that involve lunges or squats can be taken a bit lower.
You can increase the speed of transitions between asanas to create more intensity. Adding a sun salutation or vinyasa between asanas can help torch calories and fat.
You can also integrate more challenging poses. For example, you may want to try tripod headstand (sirsasana II) instead of regular headstand., One of the best ways to deepen your yoga practice and burn calories and fat is to increase the number of days you practice. You can safely build up to 5-7 days per week.Consider making yoga part of your daily routine or mix it up with other types of exercise for maximum benefit., Try combining different types of exercise with yoga. This may help you most effectively reduce your overall body fat.Cardiovascular exercise can help you lose fat when combined with yoga. Beyond walking, consider running, swimming, rowing, or biking.

, In addition to cardiovascular exercise, strength training can help you reduce fat. It builds calorie-burning muscle while promoting your overall health and may also help improve you yoga practice.Before you begin any strength training program, consult with your doctor and maybe even with a certified trainer, who will create the best plan for your abilities and needs.
Aim to do strength training moves such as leg presses that will help enhance the yoga moves you are doing to reduce your hips.

, Eating healthy, balanced, and regular meals can help you lose any weight and burn fat. Foods that have moderate fat, complex carbohydrates, and are high in nutrients, for example, are best for your general health.


Stick to a diet of about 1,500-2,000 nutrient-rich calories a day, depending on how active you are.Eat lean proteins such as chicken, ground sirloin, or edamame with most meals, which will give your metabolism a slight boost and help you burn more calories.This will also help you burn any fat that may be contributing to excess weight.
Eat whole grains such as whole wheat, oatmeal, and quinoa instead of starchy counterparts like bread., If you’re trying to reduce fat, it’s a good idea to avoid unhealthy or junk foods, many of which are loaded with fat and calories.Potato chips, nachos, pizza, burgers, cake, and ice cream will not help you lose weight, or excess water and sodium.


Stay away from starchy, refined carbs such as bread, crackers, pasta, rice, cereal, and baked goods. Eliminating these foods can also help you lose weight overall."

Start with the viparita.,
Stretch your hamstrings with big toe pose.,
Try a wide-legged standing forward bend.,
Work into a forward fold.",How to Tone Your Legs with Yoga1," The viparita, or ""legs up the wall"" pose, is a great pose for lengthening the muscles in your legs. It's also a relaxing pose that doesn't require any significant skill or flexibility to do.Laying on your back on the floor with a wall just past your feet. Slide towards the wall, walking your feet up the wall until your legs are straight against the wall.
Hold your arms out to your sides on the floor, with your elbows at right angles and your palms toward the ceiling.
Your lower back should be pressed firmly against the floor. Use a pillow or rolled towel if you feel your lower back rounding.
Stay in this position for between 7 and 10 minutes, breathing deeply in through the nose and out through the mouth.;
, Big toe pose is a deep forward bend that will help elongate your hamstrings. With this pose, take care to keep your back completely flat and your torso long as you bend over your legs.Start from a standing position with your feet about six inches apart. Lift your kneecaps by contracting your front thigh muscles, then exhale and fold forward from the hips. Keep your legs completely straight.
Curl your index and middle fingers under each of your big toes, gripping them firmly. You can wrap your thumb over those two fingers as well to close the wrap. Press your toes down against your fingers.
On an inhale, lift your torso as though you were going to stand, then lengthen your torso and fold again, going deeper into the bend. Take a few more breaths, lifting your torso on each inhale, lifting your sitting bones to the sky with every exhale.
After several breaths, bend your elbows out on an exhale, pulling on your toes and lowering yourself into a deeper bend. If your hamstrings are tight, just focus on making your torso as long as possible. Hold this position for one minute, then rise to stand on an inhale.

, The wide-legged standing forward bend provides a good stretch for your inner thighs and hamstrings, lengthening your muscles to help tone your legs as well as improve your general flexibility.From a standing position, step wide so that your feet are as far apart as you can comfortably go. Generally, they should be about as far apart as the length of one of your legs.
Place your hands on your hips and engage your quads to maintain balance as you fold forward from your hips to move to a flat back.
Lower your hands to the floor, or use a block or table if you can't reach the floor. The key here is that your back should be flat like a tabletop. Only go down as far as you can while maintaining a flat back.
On exhale, you can extend this fold and come closer to your legs if you want. Then on inhale return to a flat back. Keep in mind that the stiffer your hamstrings are, the harder it will be for you to straighten your back.

, A forward fold is perhaps the ultimate yoga pose to lengthen your hamstrings. The pose can be both difficult and extremely beneficial if you have a job that requires you to sit at a desk for long periods of time, forcing your hamstrings to contract.When you fold forward, move from the hips rather than from your waist. You aren't simply folding your upper body towards your legs. Rather, you need to move your pelvis back to lengthen your hamstrings.
From a standing position with your feet together, place your hands on your hips and lean back, getting a good stretch in your back. Then, on an inhale, release your hands to swan dive as you fold forward from the hips.
Focus on pushing your pelvis back so that it is pointed behind you rather than at the floor below you. As long as your pelvis is forward, your hamstrings will still be in a contracted position. Fold until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings, and then hold the pose for a minute or longer, breathing deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Don't aim to touch the floor. If you can only fold to the point where you rest your palms on your knees, or on your shins, that's fine. Simply work on rehabilitating your hamstrings, stretching them each time you do this exercise. Over time, you'll be able to go deeper into the fold if you're folding from the hips and moving your pelvis back to accommodate the fold.

Set time limits for children according to their age.,
Take frequent breaks between poses and after challenging or strenuous exercises.,
Demonstrate the pose.,
Warm up before beginning yoga.,
Watch what your kids eat before yoga.,
Supervise the yoga your kids do at all times.,
Use a yoga mat.",How to Teach Yoga to Kids1," Kids' bodies are still developing, so poses should not be held for too long, and the overall yoga session should match their age and ability.


Allow children 5 years old and younger to spend up to 1 minute or 60 seconds on each exercise or pose. The total yoga session for small children should not be more than 15 minutes.
Allow children who are 6 and older to hold poses and do exercises for up to 1-1/2 minutes, or 90 seconds. Older kids can often endure yoga sessions up to 25 minutes.;
, Teach kids to meditate or be still during these breaks.

, Showing kids how to do it rather than just telling them how to do it will help them move their bodies safely.

, Show kids how to stretch and loosen their bodies in preparation for yoga or any exercise.

, Yoga should never be practiced on a full stomach.

, This will keep them from trying poses that they are not yet ready for, or forcing their bodies into unnatural or harmful positions.

Do chair and half-chair poses.,
Work in a warrior sequence.,
Move to a half moon.,
Build strong quads with extended side angle pose.,
Balance in tree pose.",How to Tone Your Legs with Yoga2," Both the chair and half-chair poses are challenging poses where you'll really feel the burn in your quads. If it's too difficult for you to hold and breathe through chair pose, try alternating it with mountain pose on every other breath.Stand with your feet together, bend your knees, and lower your hips as though you are sitting in a chair. Raise your arms overhead, pressing your palms together above your head. If it's too challenging with your feet together, you can spread them to about hip-width apart. Hold the position for five deep breaths.
For half-chair pose, you simply cross your right ankle over your left knee. Otherwise everything else is the same as chair pose. Flex your right foot so that your knee is protected. Hold for five deep breaths and then repeat while standing on your right foot., There are three warrior poses, each of which works to stretch and strengthen your leg muscles, as well as helping tone the core and improve your posture. You can do these poses together in a sequence, or intersperse them with other poses.To do warrior 1, step your right foot forward from a standing position into a lunge. Your right knee should be at a right angle directly over your ankle. Extend your left leg out behind you, with your toes turned out so that the heel of your right foot bisects your left foot. Reach your arms straight up to the ceiling on either side of your head, palms facing each other. Take five deep breaths, then repeat with your left leg out front.
With warrior 2, your legs are in the same position as warrior 1. However, instead of reaching up to the ceiling, open your arms and twist so your arms form a straight line above your legs, your right arm reaching forward and your left arm reaching behind you. Hold this pose for five deep breaths, then switch and do the other side.
Warrior 3 is a balancing pose that stabilizes your lower body and strengthens your core. Come into a standing forward bend, then walk your hands under your shoulders. Shift your weight to your left foot, letting your left knee bend slightly, and raise your right leg high behind you. Adjust your right thigh so your toes will point towards the ground, pulling through your heel to maintain your balance. When you're steady, lift your hands and press your palms together in front of your chest. Hold this pose for five deep breaths, then switch to the other side.

, The half moon is a balancing pose that you can move into directly from warrior 3. This pose strengthens all of your leg muscles, while giving your inner thighs a good lengthening stretch and improving your balance and flexibility.From warrior 3, drop your right fingertips to the mat under your right shoulder and turn your body to the left as you open your hips, stacking your left hip on top of your right and keeping that left leg extended behind you.
Raise your left arm straight up toward the ceiling and shift your gaze to your left fingers.
Hold the pose for five deep breaths, then switch and do the other side.

, Extended side angle pose provides a serious strength-building exercise for your entire lower body, particularly your quadriceps. The key is to engage your legs fully and keep your body weight centered, not leaning on your arm.To begin extended side angle, stand with your feet wide apart, then turn your right foot out, so that your right heel bisects your left foot.
Bend your right knee at a right angle, your knee directly over your ankle. Reach over your head with your left arm, pulling your torso toward your right knee. Keep your torso long and flat, stacking your hips. You should feel a long line of energy running from the outer edge of your left foot through your left fingertips.
You can extend your right arm to the floor or bend your elbow and rest it on your knee. However, resist the temptation to simply lean on your right arm. Think of your upper body as weightless and let your legs do all the work of holding up your body weight.
Hold the pose for five breaths, then release back to center and switch to the other side.

, Balancing poses build a lot of strength in the standing leg. Tree pose is one of the more basic balancing poses and is accessible for beginners who may not have as much flexibility or have difficulty finding their balance.From a standing position, shift your body weight to your left leg as you bend your right knee and raise your right foot. Turn your right knee outward to rest your right foot on your left knee or thigh.
To find your balance, locate a focal point on the floor a few feet in front of you and lock your gaze on that point. Move your right foot until you find a position where you can balance firmly.
Once you've found your balance, stand tall, bringing your palms together in front of your chest in a prayer position. If you have trouble finding your balance, you can leave your arms extended outward at your sides for a little extra stability.
Firm up the thigh of your standing leg, pressing it against the sole of your foot. If you have good balance, extend your arms upward, reaching toward the sky.
Hold the pose for five breaths, with each inhale thinking of reaching upward toward the sky, each exhale pressing your left thigh and the sole of your right foot firmly. Then release to a standing position and do the other side.

Start with mountain pose.,
Transition to staff pose.,
Move to a wide-angle seated forward bend.,
Try extended hand-to-big-toe pose.,
Improve gluteal flexibility with active pigeon pose.",How to Tone Your Legs with Yoga3," Mountain pose doesn't look like much, but it's a starting point for all standing poses. This pose helps you become more aware of your lower body and the positioning of the muscles in your legs.Stand on your mat with your feet together. Your big toes should be touching, but your heels slightly apart. Extend your arms to your sides, keeping your palms flexed and your fingers together.
Focus on your breath as you lengthen and straighten your spine. Your shoulders should be neutral, with your shoulder blades falling in line with your back. Even though it may look like you're just standing, if you're particularly stiff this may be a difficult pose for you to maintain. Spreading your feet slightly can help.
Breathe deeply in through your nose, pause, then exhale slowly out of your mouth. Try to inhale for a three-count, then exhale for a three-count. After each exhale, don't rush to inhale again. Pause, then slowly and deeply inhale.

, The staff pose is a seated position that will strengthen your back and improve your posture, as well as lengthening the muscles in your legs. This pose typically is used as a transitional pose into other seated poses that will improve your flexibility.Sit on your mat with your legs extended out in front of you. Your legs should be together comfortably, not pressed together forcefully.
Pay attention to your torso. If you find yourself leaning back, it may be because your hamstrings are especially tight. In this case, you may want to sit on a blanket or rolled towel to ensure the proper alignment of your pelvis.
Extend your arms and press your palms flat against the floor on either side of you. Your arms should be straight down from your shoulders, not angled forward or back.
Firm up your thighs, turning them slightly inward, and flex your ankles. You want your legs to be a line of energy pressing out through your heels from your pelvis. Your spine is a staff, reaching up to lengthen your torso from the floor.
Hold the position for a minute or longer, imagining yourself growing ever rooted to the ground, your spine lengthening up from the base.

, A wide-angle seated forward bend really opens up your hips and improves the flexibility in your lower body while stretching the insides and backs of your legs and strengthening your spine.This pose can help you get ready for wide-leg standing poses, such as extended hand-to-big-toe pose. From staff pose, lean back and open your legs to about a 90-degree angle. Press your hands into the floor and slide forward to widen your legs further.
Press your outer thighs into your mat, keeping your knee caps pointed straight up to the ceiling, and push through the balls of your feet to stretch out your feet.
Walk your hands slowly forward between your legs, keeping your arms extended and your back flat. Remember to bend from the hips, not from the waist. Stay in the pose for at least a minute, moving deeper into the bend with every exhale. Don't bend any further than you can comfortably do while still maintaining your breath.
Raise up on an inhale, focusing on keeping your torso long and your spine straight as you come out of the bend.

, Extended hand-to-big toe pose lengthens your hamstrings as well as opening your hips, improving your flexibility, and increasing the flexibility in your legs and hips.While standing in mountain pose, pull your left knee toward your belly, reaching your left arm inside the thigh to cross it over your ankle. Hold the outside of your foot and firm up the front thigh muscles of the leg you're standing on.
On an inhale, extend your left leg forward, straightening it as much as you can. When you find your balance, swing it out to the side. Breathe deeply.
Hold the pose for about 30 seconds, then bring your leg back in on an inhale, releasing it and going back to stand on an exhale. Repeat the pose with the other leg.

, Your gluteal muscles are a key part of lower body flexibility, particularly if you want to tone your legs with yoga. The active pigeon pose stretches and improves the flexibility in your lower core, hips, and glutes.You can enter this pose from a full push-up or plank position, with your palms under your shoulders. Bend your left knee and slide or lift it to the floor near your shoulder. Your left heel should be near your right hip.
Lower to your forearms, rolling over your feet to bring your right leg down, resting the top of your right foot on the floor. If you have the flexibility to manage it, you can bring your chest all the way down to the floor, extending your arms out on the floor in front of you.
Tighten the muscles in your pelvic floor, contracting your glutes. Hold the position for a couple of breaths, with every exhale sinking deeper into the stretch. To come out of the pose, roll back over your right toes and press your right leg up through the balls of your feet. Bend your right knee to the floor so you can gently pull your left leg back to join the right.
You can repeat this stretch up to five times on one side before switching, or do it once and then do the other leg.

Invite them to observe you.,
Teach kids how to breathe.,
Show kids chants and mantras.,
Use stories that will inspire their imaginations.,
Play follow the leader.",How to Teach Yoga to Kids2," One way kids will get interested in yoga is by watching you.

, Relaxed and deep breathing is essential to the practice of yoga.


Explain that proper breathing produces calm, allows focus and increases energy. Kids often need to understand ""why"" they are asked to do something. Teaching the benefits of breathing correctly will help them learn it better.

, Before you even get into yoga poses, kids can learn a lot from the chants you might do while practicing yoga. These will have a soothing effect and help them concentrate.

, For example, pretend you are taking a trip through the jungle or you are on a deserted island as you introduce different poses.

, This game is an easy and fun way to teach kids poses. You can be the leader and the kids can be the followers.

Put a twist in your boat pose.",How to Tone Your Stomach with Yoga," Breathe in through the nose, concentrating on filling your lungs with air the way you would fill a glass with water. Expand your chest and concentrate on slowly filling every available space.When you inhale, the air in your lungs pushes the diaphragm down, which naturally causes your abdomen to protrude. However, too often people learn as adults to suck in their abdomen, which means you're not taking in as much air as you should.
When you inhale, physically push your abdomen out to make room for the air. After some practice, you may find that your body does this naturally without you having to think about it.
Breathe slowly, building air in your lungs little by little.;
, Often exhalation is more difficult to master, because as soon as you near the end of the exhalation you become too focused on quickly inhaling again, rather than completely emptying your lungs of air.When you exhale, you should exhale completely. Train yourself to pause a moment before you consciously take your next deep breath. To do this, you'll have to overcome your natural desire to inhale as soon as you've finished exhaling.
To exhale properly, reverse the inhalation process. Think of releasing first the air in your chest, then lower into your abdomen – just as you would pour out a glass of water.
As you exhale, pull your abdomen in as if to squeeze the air out. You shouldn't have to train your body on this as much as you did for inhalation. This is your body's natural inclination after you've pushed your abdomen out.

, Your diaphragm is part of your core muscle group and also plays a central role in your breathing. When you focus on activating your diaphragm to breathe deeply, you also strengthen your core muscles.When your diaphragm is engaged by the movement of your abdomen out as you inhale and in as you exhale, you'll notice results in your performance. Over time, you'll find you breathe better and function better physically.
If you're engaging your core, your chest and stomach should rise to compress your abdominal space and allow your lungs to fully expand. When you exhale, the chest and stomach will fall.
You can practice engaging and strengthening your diaphragm by lying on your back on the floor with your knees bent. Place your hands on your stomach and allow it to rise as you inhale and fall naturally as you exhale.
When you've mastered correct breathing while laying down, stand up and try the same exercise. It also can help to pause whatever you're doing throughout the day to concentrate on your breath and retrain your body to breathe correctly.

, Pranayama is the practice of breath control. Adding pranayama exercises and breathing techniques to your regular yoga practice will strengthen the top and inner muscles of your core.One common pranayama practice is known as ""ocean breath"" because it may sound like the roar of a distant ocean. To practice ocean breath, get into a comfortable position and focus on your breath. As you inhale, breathe in slowly through your nose. On exhale, open your mouth and let the air flow slowly out in a whispered ""ha"" sound. Once you've mastered this, you can exhale through your nose, but with your mouth in the same position as it was when you were exhaling out of your mouth.
You also might try alternate-nostril breathing, which yogis believe can balance your life forces. From a comfortable seated position, make a fist over your nose with your right hand and extend your thumb and ring finger. Close your right nostril with your thumb and inhale with your left nostril. Then close your left nostril with your ring finger, open your right nostril, and exhale. Repeat the cycle three to five times, keeping in mind it may take some practice to get it down.
Another pranayama practice that may benefit your effort to tone your stomach is kumbhaka pranayama, or breath retention. Holding your breath for 10 seconds after a full inhale can increase your lung capacity as well as making your muscles more oxygenated. If you can't hold your breath for 10 seconds in the beginning, try going for three seconds. As you get better and more relaxed, you can gradually start holding it for longer.

, In many ways, mastering proper breath is more important than being able to hold complicated or difficult poses. Once you've mastered your breathing, you will be able to hold poses longer and go further than you ever thought you could.Generally, you should exhale when bending forward to relax your body and increase the depth of your fold. When lifting or opening your chest, you want to inhale to energize your body and engage the same muscles.
Exhaling on a twist allows you to expel more air and rotate further with more space available as your lungs deflate.
As you practice, pay attention to your breath and make sure you're not holding your breath, particularly when moving into a challenging position. Go into a pose only as far as you can go while maintaining your deep breath.

, The tree pose is a good place to start, because it's not very complex and allows you to focus fully on your breath. All the while, your abs will be working overtime to help you maintain your balance on one leg.Start from a standing position, and shift your weight to your left leg. Grab your right ankle and press the bottom of your foot to your left thigh. Press your foot into your thigh, keeping hold of your ankle until you've found your balance.
When you find your balance, raise up and press your palms together in front of your heart. Finding a focal point in front of you to direct your gaze will help you keep your balance and your concentration.
Center your abdominal muscles around your spine and breathe deeply. Hold the pose for ten breaths, then repeat the pose standing on your right leg.

, The vinyasa flow is made up of three poses that you transition through fluidly, following your breath. To tone your stomach, do a vinyasa made of downward-facing dog, cobra pose, plank, then back to downward-facing dog.Begin downward-facing dog on your hands and knees, with your wrists directly under your shoulders and your knees directly under your hips. Make sure the fold of your wrists is parallel with the top edge of your mat. Stretch your elbows and relax your upper back, spreading your fingers wide to distribute your weight evenly between your hands as you press them into the mat. Then tuck your toes and lift your knees off the floor as you exhale, raising your pelvis toward the ceiling. Gently straighten your legs until your body forms an upside-down ""V."" Press down into your mat as you reach upward with your pelvis. Hold this pose for five breaths.
Exhale and lower your body with your arms. Inhale and lift your chest off the floor in cobra pose. Hold for five breaths.
As you exhale, move into the plank pose, holding that for five breaths.
On exhale, move back into downward-facing dog. Repeat the entire flow five times.

, The boat pose strengthens and tones your abdominals as well as the muscles in your back, legs and arms. Adding this pose to your yoga practice will give you a whole-body workout.Start by lying down on your back on your yoga mat. Keep your feet together and your arms close to your sides, and breathe in.
As you exhale, slowly lift your chest off the floor. Make sure your abs are doing the lifting, not your neck or back. At the same time, lift your feet off the ground. Your arms should be extended out straight toward your toes.
You can bend your knees at a right angle to make this pose a little easier.
Work your way up to extended boat pose, a more challenging form. From boat pose, extend your legs out and lower them until they are at about a 45-degree angle. Your body should be in roughly a ""V"" shape, with your hands straight out by your side. Hold the position for 10 deep breaths.From extended boat pose, see if you can grab your toes and lock your fingers around them.

, This variation of downward-facing dog fully exercises your lower abdomen, working those difficult-to-reach lower abdominals repeatedly.In downward-facing dog position, exhale and bend your right leg, bringing your knee towards your nose.
Put your leg back to the floor in downward-facing dog, and inhale.
On exhale, repeat the action with your left leg. This is one cycle. Do this exercise for at least ten cycles.

, You may already be familiar with planks, which are a standard exercise for building abdominal muscles. The plank pose is also a staple of yoga practice for strengthening and stabilizing your core.To get into a yoga plank position, start by lying on the floor on your stomach. Press your palms into the mat on either side of your head, and roll over your toes so they also are pressing into the mat.
Push off with your hands to raise your body off the ground. You can go into downward-facing dog first, as it's easier to drop into plank position.
From downward-facing dog, inhale and slowly lower toward the mat until your arms are perpendicular to the floor and your chest is directly over your arms. You'll be on your toes, and your body should be a long, straight line from the top of your head to your heels.
Hold this pose for several breaths. When you're ready to release, you can simply lower your body to the floor as you exhale.
You also can add the plank vinyasa to increase strength in your back and deep abdominal muscles.Tuck alternating knees towards your elbows, then returning to plank pose. This is a pulsing exercise similar to the knee-to-nose downward-facing dog variation. Alternate knees between 8 and 20 times, keeping your breathing steady – exhale as you tuck, and inhale as you return to plank position.

, From plank position, you can move into side planks, which not only strengthen your abdominals but also target your obliques, the core muscles along your sides that can be difficult to build.For the side plank, start in the plank position. On inhale, stack your right foot on the edge of your left foot and raise your body so that you're on your side.
Your left hand should be directly below your left shoulder, so that the only support you have comes from the edge of your left foot and your left hand. You can drop to your elbow if this is too hard, and allow your entire forearm to support you.
Put your right hand on your hip, elbow out and perpendicular to your body. Hold this position for between 5 and 10 breaths. Then return to the starting position and do it again on your other side.

, The seated twist is a simple pose in which you have full support because you're sitting on the floor. The pose not only works your obliques but also stabilizes your lower back, particularly the lumbar region of your spine. You can do this pose not just as part of your practice, but at any time during the day.Sit cross-legged on the floor. You can sit in the lotus position, or simply cross your legs if lotus is too difficult. The important part of your sitting position is that you are comfortable and your spine is straight and supported.
Use the obliques on your left side to begin the twisting movement while also activating the obliques on your right side to lift your belly and keep your core firm.
Twist until you can rest your left hand on the outside of your right knee, placing your left hand behind you to help stabilize your back. Keep your back neutral and breathe into the pose, turning your hips slightly in the direction opposite of the twist.
Hold this twist for a few breaths, then exhale and release back to center before repeating the action in the other direction.

, Extended triangle pose is a standing pose that will help stretch and elongate your obliques as well as strengthening them. Your abdominals also are working to stabilize your body and help you keep your balance.Stand in mountain pose with your big toes touching and your heels slightly apart. Exhale and step or jump your feet about 4 feet apart. Reach out to both sides, arms straight and parallel to the floor, palms down.
Turn your left foot slightly in towards your body, your right foot out at a 90-degree angle. Your right heel and left heel should be aligned. Turn your right thigh outward so that your right knee cap lines up with the center of your right ankle.
On exhale, extend your torso to the right over your left leg. Make sure you are bending from your hip, not from your waist. Rotate so both sides of your torso are equally long, allowing your left hip to come forward slightly. Keep your back straight and neutral with your tail bone extending towards your back heel.
Your right hand should rest on the floor beside your right foot. If you can't reach that far without destroying the lines of the pose, just rest your hand on your ankle or shin. Then stretch your left arm straight up toward the ceiling, creating a line from your shoulders all the way to your fingertips.

Set a different sequence of poses for yourself every session. This will keep your muscles from adapting and help you get the most fat-reduction benefits.If you like, start your practice with a short meditation or chanting exercise to calm your mind and center your thoughts.Follow your warm up of sun salutations with a pose or two from each of the four types of asanas. They four types of asanas are: standing poses, inversions, backbends, and forward bends. You can then end with corpse pose, which is called savasana in Sanskrit.Consider having a mixture of easy and difficult sessions, as well as short and long practice times.Consider varying how long you hold each pose. You may want to flow through asanas one day while holding them for 30 seconds to a minute on other days. This can help challenge your muscles.;
, If you’re practicing vigorous yoga to reduce fat, it is important to warm up your body. Doing a few rounds of sun salutations, which are called Surya Namaskar in Sanskrit, can effectively prepare your muscles and mind to practice yoga while helping your body reduce fat.There are three different variations of sun salutations. Do 2-3 rounds sun salutation. to warm up. This can engage and condition your muscles, may help ensure a safe and more pliable practice, and could minimize your overall body fat.Add a sun salutation between different poses to incorporate more flow and challenge into your mind and body., You do not have to be able to do every yoga asana, or pose, in existence to have an effective daily practice or to build muscle and lose fat. Incorporating and mastering different poses can help you put together a daily practice which won’t get boring or routine and may help you lose fat.Make sure to start with easier asanas and move on to more difficult poses as you master basic ones.Do asanas from each type of pose in the following order: standing poses, inversions, backbends, and forward bends.Add a twisting pose to neutralize and stretch your spine between backbends and forward bends if you like.Add standing poses that engage leg, butt, and back muscles such as tree pose or the Warrior Series.As you progress, you can incorporate more challenging standing poses such as Extended Triangle Pose and Revolved Triangle Pose.Add inversions that engage your arm, back, and abdominal muscles including handstand. You can practice handstand on a wall until you have enough strength to hold yourself up.Gradually add forearm balance and headstand as your practice improves.Add back, arm, and leg strengthening backbends including locust pose, cobra pose, bridge pose.Work up to bow pose and full wheel or upward bow.Add a twist if you need a balance between backbends and forward bends. Twists can get quite deep, Bharadvaja’s twist before moving on to more difficult asanas such as half lord of the fishes pose.Add leg, butt, and back strengthening forward bends such as seated forward bend, heat of the knee pose, or star pose and hold them each for 8-10 balanced breaths.Finish active practice with closing postures such as supported shoulder-stand, fish pose, and legs up the wall pose.These poses engage the muscles of you arms, back, abdominals, and legs, but also calm your mind
End your practice in corpse pose and enjoy the benefits of your yoga session., You can add a flowing sequence between poses for added fat reducing benefit, which is often called “taking a vinyasa.” This will add three specific flowing poses in between other asanas, which can help keep the tempo of your practice elevated.This is a much more difficult series than simply lowering into asanas, but has the benefit of more strength training and stretching.
Starting in whichever asana you choose, lower your body or thrust your legs until you land in a four point staff pose, which is called chaturanga dandasana in Sanskrit.Your elbows should be close to your body and bent at a 90 degree angle. Make sure to keep the abs and back side of the body engaged. This is a difficult position and keeping these muscles working will make it much easier.From chatturanga dandasana, roll over your toes to an upward facing dog position. This will make it easier to transition to the next and your final position, downward facing dog.Use your flexed toes to roll over on to the backs of your feet. Keep your thighs engaged and off of the floor as you push your chest through your arms. Gently arch your back and look up at the ceiling.End in downward facing dog. You’ve reached the final pose in your vinyasa series and a well-earned rest, so exhale and roll back over your toes so that your body ends up in an inverted “V” shape, which is downward facing dog. This position should feel calming and allow you to rest as you get deeper into the asana, or pose.Keep your palms pressing flat against the floor, your sitting bones lifted towards the ceiling, and your abs engaged.Inhale and exhale steadily for as many breaths as you like., Try extending the duration of your practice by holding each pose a bit longer, adding additional asanas and flowing seamlessly between the poses. Add new and more challenging poses as you are able.Many yoga classes are between 60 and 90 minutes, so you could set your practice around that length or attend a class at a studio.

, You may want to increase the intensity of your practice to help build strength, burn calories and reduce fat. This can be done easily by holding each asana for different period and by challenging yourself with more difficult asanas.


For example, poses that involve lunges or squats can be taken a bit lower.
You can increase the speed of transitions between asanas to create more intensity. Adding a sun salutation or vinyasa between poses can help torch calories and fat.
You can also integrate more challenging poses. For example, you may want to try tripod headstand instead of regular headstand., One of the best ways to deepen your yoga practice and burn calories and fat is to increase the number of days you practice. You can safely build up to 5-7 days per week.#*Consider making yoga part of your daily routine or mix it up with other types of exercise for maximum benefit., Yogic breathing, or pranayama, is one of the core skills of any yoga practice. Focusing on your breathing can deepen your asana practice, tune you into your own body, and boost your metabolism.


Pranayama can help your body distribute oxygen to your body. The goal is to breath deeply by inhaling and exhaling completely and in a balanced manner through your nose. For example, you would inhale for 4 breaths, hold for 2 counts, and then exhale completely for four breaths. You can vary the counts according to your abilities.You want to get the most out of your yogic breathing, so sit upright, with your shoulders back, and refrain from slouching. Breath slowly and evenly by focusing from your stomach, pulling in your belly to expand you lungs and rib cage.You can also try a form of breathing called ujjayi in Sanskrit, which can help you flow through your practice more effectively. You do ujjayi by inhaling and exhaling evenly through your nose and making a slight sound like the sea when you breathe.

, Try mixing different types of exercise with yoga. This may help you most effectively reduce your overall body fat.Aim to walk 10,000 steps a day, which translates to walking about 5 miles (or 8km) per day.Wearing a pedometer can help you make sure you’re taking enough steps per day.
Any type of cardiovascular exercise can help you lose fat when combined with yoga. Beyond walking, consider running, swimming, rowing, or biking.

, In addition to cardiovascular exercise, strength training can help you reduce fat. It builds calorie-burning muscle while promoting your overall health and may also help improve you yoga practice.Before you begin any strength training program, consult with your doctor and maybe even with a certified trainer, who will create the best plan for your abilities and needs.

, Eating healthy, balanced, and regular meals can help you lose any weight and burn fat. Foods that have moderate fat, complex carbohydrates, and are high in nutrients, for example, are best for your general health.


Stick to a diet of about 1,500-2,000 nutrient-rich calories a day, depending on how active you are.Eat lean proteins such as chicken, ground sirloin, or edamame with most meals, which will give your metabolism a slight boost and help you burn more calories.This will also help you burn any fat that may be contributing to excess weight.
Eat whole grains such as whole wheat, oatmeal, and quinoa instead of starchy counterparts like bread., If you’re trying to reduce fat, it’s a good idea to avoid unhealthy or junk foods, many of which are loaded with fat and calories.Potato chips, nachos, pizza, burgers, cake, and ice cream will not help you lose weight, or excess water and sodium.


Stay away from starchy, refined carbs such as bread, crackers, pasta, rice, cereal, and baked goods. Eliminating these foods can also help you lose weight overall."

Keep a practice journal.",How to Perform Yoga," There are a number of ways of doing yoga: by yourself or in a class; quick or slow; in a hot room; focused on relaxation or power. In addition, different schools of yoga favor different sequences of poses. The type of yoga you choose will depend on how advanced you are, what you hope to accomplish, and personal preference.;
, If you're a beginner worried about being able to do the poses, or if you want a workout that relaxes you more than stresses you, you'll want to choose one of these schools:


Restorative (focus: relaxation) – Blocks, blankets, and bolsters are used to support your body during poses so that you can allow your muscles to relax.Svaroopa (focus: relaxation) – Great for beginners, svaroopa uses chair poses and props in a relaxing form of yoga focused on releasing tension.Ananda (focus: meditation) – Ananda uses gentle postures and controlled breathing to prepare you for meditation.Hatha (focus: relaxation and meditation) – Hatha combines postures, pranayama (regulated breathing), and meditation into a relaxing exercise that moves slowly and does not require holding poses too long.Kripalu (focus: relaxation; self-awareness) – The focus is not on precision, but rather on holding poses for an extended time while you explore the sensations of your body and mind. Beginners focus on learning the poses. For expert practitioner, kripalu is meditation in motion., Yin yoga involves using props to help you relax into postures that you hold for 5 to 20 minutes. It is a meditative form of yoga that will help improve your flexibility., Fans of high intensity interval training (HIT), running, or biking might want to try a yoga class that moves quickly from pose to pose, getting your heart rate up and providing a good cardio workout.


Iyengar (focus: precision of poses; endurance) – Ideal for beginners and experienced yogis alike, iyengar focuses on perfecting poses. Props like blocks and blankets are used to make sure your body is in perfect alignment. Poses are held for a long time, building endurance.Vinyasa (focus: cardio) – Classes involve a 90-mintues sequence of poses that link breathing and movement in a way similar to dance. If you like pumping music and a racing heart, this is the yoga for you.Power (focus: cardio; strength) – It's exactly what it sounds like: yoga for people who are looking for a workout, not spiritual enlightenment. Power yoga combines traditional yoga poses with postures taken from calisthenics – i.e. push-ups, handstands, toe-touches, and side bends. There are no pauses between poses in this high-paced, intense form of yoga.Bikram (focus: strength; endurance; flexibility; weight loss) – Bikram involves a fixed sequence of 26 poses and two breathing exercises performed over a 90 minute period in a room heated to 105 degrees with 40% humidity. The idea is to build strength and endurance while sweating out toxins. The fixed sequence makes it easier to learn for beginners.Ashtanga (focus: strength; endurance; flexibility) – Ashtanga involves six series of specific yoga poses performed continuously. This is a physically demanding form of yoga that is not for beginners.,


Kundalini (focus: spiritual elevation) – 90 minute classes incorporate poses, challenging breathing exercises, meditation, and movement-oriented postures, along with chanting and singing. These classes are meant to challenge your physically in order to help you awaken the energies that will elevate you spiritually.TriYoga (focus: strength; spiritual awakening) – If you like losing yourself in dancing, this is the practice for you. TriYoga is similar to Kundalini, minus the chanting and singing. It is a flowing, dance like practice that combines movement, poses, breathing exercises, and meditation.Forrest (focus: strength; emotional exploration) – Developed by Ana Forrest, this challenging form of yoga mixes sequences that flow quickly from pose to pose with periods of emotional exploration.Integral (focus: strength; self-realization) – It combines poses, breathing exercises, meditation, chanting, prayer, and self-inquiry to cultivate a strong body, clear mind, and life full of joy.ISHTA (focus: spiritual growth) – It uses postures with very specific alignments, breathing exercises, meditation, and visualization to open energy channels.Jivamukti (focus: spiritual growth) – If you're dedicated to animal rights or other forms of activism, this is the yoga style for you. It embraces the ethical aspect of yoga. It combines challenging sequences of poses with scriptural study, Sanskrit chanting, vegetarianism, non-violence, music, and meditation., If you are doing yoga in a class, the studio will provide this space. If you are practicing at home, you'll want to choose a quite, non-cluttered space that is large enough to spread out your mat, and which has no sharp edges nearby., You'll want something that is form-fitting so as not to show off too much skin, but also loose enough that you'll be able to move comfortably. That means avoiding baggy shorts or T-shirts, as well as skintight running tights. Cotton is good for normal classes, but for hot classes, you'll want to be wear a fabric that wicks away sweat.Pants - Most women prefer leggings, but tight shorts also work. Men typically wear tight shorts.
Shirt – Fitted tank tops offer freedom of movement without revealing too much. Men sometimes choose to wear no shirt, particularly for hot yoga.
Ladies - Be sure to wear a sports bra. Some poses will cause even a fitted tank top to ride up.
Men – Wear underwear. No one wants to see your junk. Boxer briefs are usually preferred., Any type of yoga mat will work. That said, there is now a variety of choice – thickness, texture, color, softness, price – so there's no reason not to get the mat that's just right for you.Thickness – Mats typically come in three thicknesses: ¼ inch, 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm), and 1/16 inch. Most people will want a ¼ inch mat, as they are more comfortable, but advanced yogis may opt for a 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) mat that gives greater stability in difficult poses. 1⁄16 inch (0.2 cm) mats are mostly for travel; they can easily be folded and put in a suitcase.
Materials – The material will decide how spongy, sticky, and durable your mat is. PVC is the standard material, offering good give, grip, and endurance. There are also more eco-friendly mats made of recycled rubber (avoid if you have a latex allergy), or jute and cotton (these last two are less soft).
Price – You can get a simple ¼ inch PVC mat for $20-$30. You'll pay more for patterns, designs, antimicrobial treatments (worth it if you don't clean your mat regularly), and textures. Eco-friendly mats generally cost more.

, Yoga is exercise, and exercise means sweat. For room-temperature yoga, you'll want a small towel you can use to wipe off your mat if it gets sweaty. For hot yoga, a towel is absolutely vital. You'll want one large enough to cover your mat so that sweat won't cause you to slip and slide., You'll want to bring at least a 20oz. water bottle. Be sure to sip throughout your workout rather than gulping it. For hot yoga, you'll want to make sure you drink plenty of water the day before so you are hydrated going into class. You'll also want to pack extra water for class, or refill your bottle halfway through.


Don't drink coffee, tea, or soft drinks for a few hours before hot yoga, as caffeine can both dehydrate you and elevate your heart rate., A light snack – fruit, a granola bar, half a peanut butter sandwich – eaten 1-2 hours before class can give you extra energy. Don't eat right before class, and if possible don't eat a big meal within 2 hours of class., If you don't want to stand out in a bad way at your yoga class, there are a few simple rules you'll want to follow:Take off your shoes – Yoga is practiced barefoot.
Arrive early – You need to show up at least 5 minutes early to set up your mat, stretch, and prepare mentally. This will also ensure you get a good spot. Yoga classes can be crowded.
Respect other's space – Don't place your mat directly in front or behind someone else. Stagger your mat, both so everyone can see the teacher, and so no one ends up staring at your butt.
Be quiet – People will be meditating or stretching. Enter and leave quietly. Yoga class is not the place for conversation.
Turn off your phone – Don't be that person.
Gather equipment – If there are blocks, straps, or blankets, get some. Take two blocks, one strap, and a couple of blankets. These props can help you get in the right position during poses.
Shavasana – This is the last, resting pose that most classes end with. Lying with your head towards the front of the class during this pose shows respect for your teacher.

, Yoga is all about the connection between you and your body. To get the most out of class, spend some time stretching. Focus on the sensations in your body as you do so. Concentrate on breathing deeply in and out. Taking a moment to relax and center yourself can help you to get a lot more out of your class.


Check out http://www.prevention.com/fitness/yoga/morning-yoga-poses-wake-you for a list of good stretches that will get you read for class.

, Poses – or asanas – are the different positions you take during yoga. If you are in a class, the instructor will direct you into various positions and help you adopt the proper alignment. For a library of poses, as well as some sequences that are good for beginners, consult http://www.yogajournal.com/category/poses/ or http://www.yogabasics.com/practice/yoga-postures/. You can also try starting with these basic poses:


Knees to chest (apanasana) – Lie on your back, draw both knees towards your chest, and hold your shins if necessary. Gently rock side to side to massage your lower back. Hold for 8-10 breaths.Supine twist – Start with knees to your chest. Lay your arms out to either side so you form a T. Drop your knees to the right, one stacked on the other. Hold for 4-5 breaths and then repeat on the other side.Cat-cow pose – Start on your hands and knees, with your shoulders aligned with your wrists and your hips over your knees. As you inhale, arch your spine (a concave curve - your chest should move forward and your belly toward the floor) and lift your head to look up. As you exhale, round your spine (convex curve) and lower your head to look back towards your navel. Repeat 4-5 times.
Mountain pose – Stand tall with feet together, your weight even distributed on both feet, and your arms at your sides. Take a deep breath and raise your hands over your head with your arms straight and palms facing one another. Hold for 4-5 breaths, then repeat 4-5 times. Downward dog – Start on all fours with your hands aligned with your shoulders. Walk your hands forward a few inches and spread your fingers. With feet hip-width apart and knees slightly bent, press your hips towards the ceiling so that your body forms an inverted V. Hold for 3 breaths.
Cobra – Start prone on your stomach, with your hands on the floor under your shoulders and your elbows tucked into your body. As you inhale, keep your pelvis touching the floor while you straighten your arms so that your torso bends backwards and your chest lifts off the floor. Hold for 4-5 breaths.Child's pose – A good pose to end on. With your big toes pointed and touching, sit back on your heels, then stretch out forward with your arms straight so that your fingertips, forehead, and knees are touching the floor. Breathe deeply.

, Yoga uses a technique of controlling breathing, or pranayama, which is just as important as the poses you adopt. There are many types of breathing used during yoga; for a complete guide to pranayama consult http://www.yogajournal.com/category/poses/types/pranayama/. The basic three types you will need are:Quiet breathing (natural without effort) – It is typically used during the ending period of relaxation and meditation.
Deep breathing (long, deep breaths) - Yoga that focuses on relaxation, or during which the poses are held for a long time, often emphasizes deep breathing.
Fast breathing (a deliberate increase in breathing rate) - More exercise-focused yoga that moves quickly from poses to pose often incorporates more fast breathing.

, Teachers often move through the class, helping to guide student's bodies into the proper alignment during poses. It is fine if you do not wish to be touched. Simply let the teacher know., You don't have to perform every pose during a class. If you feel light-headed or your muscles are shaking, it is best to take a break by assuming the child's pose: point your toes as you sit back on your heels, then reach forward with your arms straight out so that your fingertips, knees, and forehead are all touching the mat., Yoga might be hard, but it shouldn't hurt. If you feel a sharp pain, twinge, or tear, then stop the pose you are in. You can assume the child's pose and then try the next pose. If the pain continues after you stop the pose, you should leave the class and seek medical attention if necessary.

, Some people in your class will be more flexible. Some will be stronger. Don't worry about it. The goal of yoga is not to be ""better."" Remember why you are there, whether for exercise, relaxation, spiritual awakening, or all of the above. None of these goals are helped by comparing yourself to others., Whether you are doing yoga alone at home in a studio, a journal is a great place to keep track of your progress, list the poses that you've learned, and write down any ""aha"" moments you might have had during meditation."

If you're sitting in a chair, keep your back away from the back of the chair. You should feel comfortable and able to relax.Double breathing is the basis of many of the energizing exercises because it increases the oxygen in your blood. It may also detoxify your blood.;
, You should breathe in through your nostrils with a short, sharp intake of air. Immediately after this short breath, take a long, stronger breath through your nostrils.The long breath should completely fill your lungs. As you inhale, your diaphragm should drop down so that your belly and abdomen expand.

, Once your lungs have completely filled, exhale through your mouth and nose. You should first breathe out with a short exhalation and then slowly exhale so that the breathe is released gradually.#*Your breath (not your voice) should make a huh-huhhhuhh sound as you breathe out. Repeat the double breathing exercise 8 to 10 times., Raise your arms to shoulder height while you double inhale.

Try to make sure all ten of your fingers and all ten of your toes are pressing into the floor. Your toes should never be tucked under you for this pose.;
, You want your palms slightly lower than your shoulder, so that the tips of your finger are roughly right below your shoulder muscles. Spread your fingers and press your palms into the floor evenly. You'll be only a few inches off the floor at this point, your spine still mostly straight.








Be sure to keep your elbows close to your body, pointing behind you instead of out to the sides.

,, You want to engage your abs to protect your lower back. Focus on keeping these muscles engaged throughout the exercise -- this will keep your thighs firmly on the ground as you bend upwards.









If you feel your hips lifting up from the floor, use your abs to push your pelvis back towards the floor.

, Keeping your hands, your hips, and the tops of your feet firmly planted on the floor, begin to lift your upper torso. Tilt your chin upward and lift your chest toward the ceiling, as if exposing your heart to the sky. Right now your chest should only be 8-12"" from the floor.








Remember: you can use your hands for support, but don't put too much pressure in them yet. Try to let your back and abs do most of the work to lift you.
If it feels uncomfortable to tilt your chin up, try keeping your neck straight and gazing at the floor. Your head should be relaxed and comfortable., Try to hold cobra pose for five full breaths before gently releasing to the floor or stretching back further. If you start to feel pain or tightness in your back, release the pose immediately.








, Push back slowly, using your arms, abs, and back together to deepen the stretch. As you exhale, focus on bending back just a few more centimeters. Control your breathing, stretch for 1-2 breaths, then keep pushing back to get a higher, more advanced cobra pose.









You may or may not be able to straighten your arms in this pose, depending on how long your arms are. If your pelvis begins to lift off the floor when you straighten your arms, keep a slight bend in your elbows. Remember-- keeping your lower body still is more important than going back further.

, The better your form, the healthier and more beneficial the pose will be. Watch the attached videos, focusing on how each muscle and joint seems both relaxed and in line, not wildly splayed out. To review, you should:









Keep the tops of your feet, thighs, hips, and palms firmly on the floor at all times.
Keep your shoulders down and back, away from your ears.
Your fingers and toes should be splayed for balance, but still light and loose -- you should be able to freely wiggle every digit.
Move slowly, taking deep, controlled breathes.
Focus on a solid core, contracting your abdominal muscles to help move.

, Your hands will be by your heart. Slowly bring them up above your head, then drop them down to the ground, as if you were touching your toes. Remember to bend from your hips -- it is okay if you can't touch the ground yet.








, You can bend your knees if you must. You want your palms down so that your fingers are under your shoulders. Your hands should be roughly shoulder-width apart.








, You'll be in a plank, with both palms at your sides and your feet kicked back. You should be resting on your toes, but you can also skip ahead and rest on the tops of your feet if it doesn't hurt your ankles. Your knees should be on the ground.








, You'll form a little zig-zag, with your feet and chin down low and your butt in the air. This position is just a quick, transitory position.








, This is the cobra movement -- your lower body will hit the floor as your back bends and your head comes up. When finished, you should be in a cobra pose.









If this motion is hard at first, Just work on dropping your butt down so that your hips are on the floor. You can then adjust your hands and feet so that you're in cobra.

, You'll generally be transitioning into downward dog from here. Lower down so that, briefly, your entire body is lying on the floor.








, This will feel very similar to a basic push-u position.








, Push up first to your knees, with your butt high. Then keep moving until your legs are straight. Your palms and soles of your feet should be planted firmly on the ground, your butt in the air, so that you from a triangle with the ground.









Keep your toes and fingers splayed and comfortable. You should be able to wiggle all twenty digits.
You arms and legs should all be straight, with only a slight bend in the knees and elbows.

, If cobra pose is challenging for you, take it slow and bend your back very gently. It is perfectly fine to stay in a very low cobra pose instead of advancing to a high cobra. You should never force your back to bend if it is not comfortable, as this can lead to serious injury.








If you feel discomfort in your back when your palms are on the floor, try resting your forearms on the floor with your elbows under your shoulders for sphinx pose.
You can also perform cobra pose standing up by placing your hands against a wall and pushing them down, just as you would push against the floor in a traditional cobra. Open your chest and arch your back by drawing your shoulder blades towards each other and tilting your head slightly back. This is a great variation to choose if you are pregnant.

, If cobra pose is easy for you, you can continue to improve your strength, flexibility, and balance by adding new variations to the pose.









To challenge your balance while in cobra pose, bend your right knee and grab your ankle with your right hand for half frog pose. Hold for five breaths, relax, and repeat on the other side. Grab for your ankle with your opposite hand for an even greater challenge.
If you want to get a slightly deeper back bend in cobra pose, try placing yoga blocks under your hands.
Lift your hands a few inches off the floor in order to challenge your balance and further engage the muscles in your back., Only progress to a deeper back bend if cobra pose is easy for you and you are looking for something more challenging. Upward facing dog pose is similar to cobra pose, but offers a deeper back bend because the hips and upper legs are lifted off of the ground and more weight is placed in the hands.








Many people confuse cobra pose and upward facing dog. Remember, if you are doing cobra pose, your hips should be planted firmly on the ground and there should be minimal weight in your hands.
There are lots of other great choices for back bends too, including wheel pose, bridge pose, and camel pose, just to name a few. Choose the one that works best for you, or try incorporating all of them into your yoga practice.

, Instead of practicing cobra pose in isolation, practice it as part of a sequence of poses. This is the way you will practice cobra pose in most yoga classes.









A vinyasa flow typically involves a transition from upward facing dog or cobra pose to chaturanga, which is a yoga push up, and finally to downward facing dog. This sequence may be repeated multiple times in a row or at many different times throughout class.There are many different sun salutations, but most involve mountain pose and a standing forward bend, followed by a vinyasa flow. Warrior I, warrior II, and warrior III poses are common in sun salutations as well., You should avoid cobra pose if you have carpal tunnel syndrome or other wrist injuries, if you have recently had surgery, or if you have back problems that are irritated by bending.If you are pregnant, you should avoid lying on your stomach for this pose, but you can modify the pose by standing up with your hands against a wall and bending your spine the same way you would for the traditional version of the pose.
If you have never practiced yoga before, talk to your doctor to make sure you are healthy enough to begin a yoga practice and to discuss any modifications you should make to your practice.

, Make sure you wear clothes that will allow you to move freely and will not distract you during your yoga practice.


You may want to have a small towel to place under your hands to prevent them from slipping on your mat if you begin to sweat.

, If you are practicing outside of a yoga class, try to find a quiet space that is free from distractions for your yoga practice. You should have enough room to lay out your yoga mat and extend your arms in all directions without hitting anything.

, You can take cobra pose to a few different levels, depending on the flexibility of your spine. No matter how flexible you are, start off with a gentle back bend to get your body warmed up.









Make sure to stick to your own limits and try not to compare yourself to others in order to get the most out of your practice and avoid injury.
If you are taking a yoga class, your instructor will probably have you do a ""low cobra"" or ""baby cobra"" at the beginning, and will later allow you to work up to a ""high cobra"" pose if this works for you. This progression allows you to slowly warm up your spine.

Sit down on the fitness ball.,
Check for proper compression.,
Check a sizing chart.",How to Measure a Fitness Ball1," Distribute your weight evenly and keep your feet flat on the floor. If the ball’s the right size for you, your hips and knees should both be bent at about 90 degrees, and your thighs should be horizontal.Your upper body should be vertical with your ears, shoulders and pelvis aligned. Don’t lean in any direction to avoid creating a counterbalance.;
, It's not enough for the ball to fit your body; it also needs to be properly inflated. A properly inflated fitness ball should compress about 6 inches when you sit on it.


If the ball fits your body but compresses more than 6 inches beneath you, it's not the right size ball for you; it's a larger ball that's been under-inflated. You can exercise on such a ball, but may find that the extra-soft ball feels awkward and makes balancing too easy.
Don't over-inflate a smaller ball to make it fit your body; the extra pressure makes it more likely to burst.
When fully inflated, you should be able to press 2” into the fitness ball with your finger.Fitness balls lose pressure with use and age. As your ball ages, you may need to inflate it more often.

, Manufacturers provide fitness ball sizing charts that correlate ball diameter with body height. These are only estimates and vary widely between the various ball manufacturers. Give how the ball actually fits your body higher priority than the sizing charts.


You may be able to successfully use a smaller or larger sized fitness ball as you gain experience.

Wrap a flexible measuring tape all the way around the inflated fitness ball.,
Measure the circumference of the fitness ball.,
Convert your measurement.",How to Measure a Fitness Ball2," Some fitness balls have concentric rings marked around the ball; use the widest of these rings around the ball's “equator” to help you align the tape correctly.

, Fitness ball sizes are listed in diameter (the distance straight from one side of the sphere to the opposite side, passing through the center), not circumference. Divide the circumference by pi, or 3.14, to get the diameter.


For example, if your ball has a circumference of 172 centimeters, its diameter is 172 / 3.14 = 55cm.
Your exercise ball may stretch up to 24 hours after you inflate it. Measure your fitness ball when it’s fully inflated to ensure it’s the right size for your body.

, Fitness ball sizes are always measured in centimeters, even in countries that usually use Imperial measurements. If you measured in inches, you'll need to make the appropriate conversion.


The most common ball sizes, translated to centimeters and rounded up to the nearest inch, are: 45cm = 18 inches, 55cm = 22 inches, 65cm = 26 inches, and 76cm = 30 inches.

"
"
Check the ball's packaging for the ball's intended diameter.,
Place a large box away from the wall at a distance equaling the ball’s diameter.,
Roll the ball between the box and the wall.,
Measure the height of your fitness ball against a wall.",How to Measure a Fitness Ball3," If you don't have the ball's packaging, check the ball itself; the intended size is often printed near the air valve or on the ball's ""equator.""

, Use a yardstick or tape measure and make sure this distance is exact. The box you use should measure at least as high as your fitness ball.

, If it passes through without brushing either, it's underinflated. When correctly inflated, the edges of the ball should just graze the box and the wall.


If you don't know the ball's intended diameter but need to know its actual size, place the ball against the wall. Position the box so that it just touches the opposite side of the ball. Then remove the ball, and measure from the box to the wall to calculate the ball's diameter.

, Alternatively, you can use your ball’s height to determine whether it’s inflated correctly. Use painter’s tape and make a mark on your wall at the same height as the fitness ball’s diameter. Then, inflate your fitness ball until it’s level with this mark.


The diameter of your fitness ball is the same as its height. "

Gather your materials.,
Cut the four yards of fabric into two pieces.,
Put the quilt batting between the two pieces of fabric.,
Use the sewing machine to attach the two pieces of fabric together.,
Continue sewing one half of the mat.,
Finish the edges with the bias tape.,
Add ties to the mat.,
Put the non slip fabric on the mat.,
Try a Twister mat.,
Practice on a clean area rug.,
Use non slip shoes and rubber gloves.",How to Make a Homemade Yoga Mat," If you’re looking for a homemade alternative to a rubber mat, use cotton fabric to create a soft, durable yoga mat. For a standard sized yoga mat, you will need:Four yards of cotton fabric in a plain or neutral color. Choose a color you won’t mind staring at for long periods of time while holding your yoga poses.
11 yards of coordinating bias tape.
Hi-lift quilt batting.
Two yards of non slip fabric.
Fabric glue.
A dinner plate.
Fabric chalk.
Sewing pins.
Access to a sewing machine.;
, Make each piece 2 yards by 1 yard. These pieces are going to form the two sides of the your yoga mat.


You can give the mat rounded edges by folding the pieces into quarters. Use a plate to draw a curve on the edges of both pieces of fabric with a piece of fabric chalk. Then, trim the fabric along the chalk line.

, Batting is the white, fluffy material that is found in the middle of quilts. Look for regular batting at your local craft store, or iron on batting that has an adhesive that sticks to your fabric. Iron on batting tends to move around and shift over time, so use regular batting if possible.Attach the batting to the two pieces of fabric using sewing pins, or follow the instructions on the package to iron on the batting if you are using iron on batting. Stagger the sewing pins about six inches apart on either side of the fabric so the batting is firmly in the middle of the two fabrics.

, If you have never quilted before, you will need to make sure your machine has the quilting walking foot attachment on it. You may need to take off the regular shank on the machine with a screwdriver to then attach the quilting walking foot.Use the fabric chalk to draw a vertical line in the center of the top piece of fabric. You should start by sewing on the marked line to make sure the tension of the machine is correct and to get used to sewing a straight line. You should be sewing down the length of the fabric.
You can wear quilting gloves to help you guide the quilt through the sewing machine, as it can be tricky to keep both pieces of fabric straight as you sew. You can also make your own quilting gloves using a cheap pair of knit gloves and drawing lines on the insides of the gloves with fabric paint.

, Use the line drawn with fabric chalk as a marker and sew lines moving from the inside to the outside on one half of the mat.You can then flip the mat around and sew lines down the other half of the mat, starting from the inside and moving outward.
When you are finished, you should have evenly spaced rows of sewn lines down both sides of the fabric.

, You can purchase bias tape at your local craft store. Use pins to keep the bias tape in place as you use the sewing machine to sew on it on. The bias tape will give the mat a nice finished edge., If you would like to add ties to make it easier to keep the mat rolled up as you go to and from the yoga studio, use the extra bias tape to create ties.Cut four 18 inch pieces of bias tape. Then, fold the short edges of the tape about ¼ inch under and sew them down. Re fold the bias tape pieces and sew along the open edges.
Use pins to attach two pieces of sewn bias tape 6 inches in from each end of the mat. Place one piece on each side of the mat and sew them into place.

, If you are planning to use the mat on a surface other than carpet, you will need to attach non-slip fabric to the bottom side of the mat to ensure it does not slip or shift under you during yoga class.You can cut the non slip fabric into shapes, like diamonds or circles, and use the fabric glue to attach them to the bottom side of the mat. You can also put two diamonds or circles on either end of the top side of the mat so your hands and feet are secure when you practice yoga.
Another option is to cut the non slip fabric so it covers both sides of the mat fully and attach both pieces with fabric glue so you have a full non slip surface that you can move around on during yoga class.

, If you have an edition of Twister lying around that you no longer use, repurpose the colorful Twister mat by using it as your yoga mat. The Twister mat is made of materials that will stay in place as you move, shift, and twist during your yoga class.You can also use the colorful circles on the mat as markers for your hands and feet as you practice yoga.

, Look for a long, narrow area rug at your local home decor store and use it as a yoga mat. Check that the area rug has a non slip surface on the bottom so it will stay in place as you move around.Try to buy an area rug that is machine washable, or easy to clean, and made of short, durable fibers. You will likely sweat during your yoga class and you want to be able to wash the rug after you use it.

, If you do not have access to an area rug or another mat, you can substitute a mat with a pair of non slip shoes and a pair of rubber gloves. Put the shoes on your feet and the gloves on your hands. You can then feel secure on any surface, from carpet to wood to tile, as you do your yoga moves.Avoid practicing barefoot and bare handed on a towel or a blanket, as these materials are no slip proof and can shift or move around as you do yoga.

Gather your supplies.,
Decide how to secure the bolster.,
Determine how long to use the bolster.",How to Make a Yoga Bolster1," To make a bolster, you will need some old blankets (to use as stuffing) and a sheath for the stuffing.If you want to make a temporary bolster that can be taken apart at will, use a pillow case and string or safety pins. If you want a permanent bolster, you can use 3/4 yard of the fabric of your choosing and sew it shut.You can also use old towels instead of blankets, if you prefer.No matter which materials you choose to use, make sure that the final product will give you sufficient lift and support as you practice your yoga positions. Blankets may be bulkier than towels, but ultimately either material should work well in a bolster.;
, There are a number of options when it comes to binding the bolster together. One popular option is to use safety pins.However, these may be uncomfortable during certain yoga poses. Another alternative is rubber bands, which can be stretched around the width of the bolster to hold everything in place. Yet another option is to use yarn or string to bind the bolster. Use whichever materials you prefer, or whatever you have on hand.

, If you intend to take your bolster apart and use the blankets or towels inside, you may want to secure the open end of the bolster with string or a rubber band. If you will be using the bolster as a permanent addition to your yoga practice, you may wish to sew the opening shut for greater stability and durability.

"
"
Roll and insert the filling.,
Check your measurements.,
Secure the bolster.",How to Make a Yoga Bolster2," The filling, whether you choose to use old blankets or towels, will need to be rolled up lengthwise. Lay the filling out flat and roll it up tightly, like a yoga mat.Consider using rubber bands or string to bind the rolled-up filling. This will make it easier to stuff the filling inside your pillow case or cloth, and will also help keep the bolster tight during use.
Once the filling is rolled, you'll need to insert it into the sheath. If you're using a pillow case, this should be fairly easy. All you'll need to do is slide the filling inside the pillow case, while retaining the tight wrap of the filling., If the bolster is too small, you can add additional filling (towels or blankets) to create a longer or thicker bolster. If it's too large, you can scale back on your filling. Ultimately, though, the size of the finished product should be determined by your body and your needs.


A common size for cylindrical bolsters is 24 inches long by eight inches high. Some yoga practitioners find this height ideal for well-supported forward bends and a deep chest opening.Some yoga practitioners prefer a smaller bolster for supporting the neck, knees, and spine. If you want a smaller bolster, try aiming for 16 inches long and five to six inches high., If you used a pillow case, securing the open end will be easy. Simply use a rubber band or piece of string to tightly tie the open end shut.This will give you a functional bolster that can still be taken apart as needed.

"
"
Roll the filling.,
Check your measurements.,
Measure your sheath materials.,
Secure the bolster.",How to Make a Yoga Bolster3," Similar to the temporary bolster, you'll need to roll the filling lengthwise into a tight, compact bundle. Whether you are using blankets or towels, decide on how thick you want the finished product to be, and roll them up accordingly.If you're worried about the materials coming undone, either during the sewing process or after the bolster is finished, you may want to bind the rolled-up filling with rubber bands, string, or even strips of velcro.

, If this is your first yoga bolster, you should check the measurements before sewing it shut to ensure that it is adequately thick. Or you could simply make multiple bolsters to suit your various yoga needs. If the bolster is too small, add additional filling (towels or blankets) to the existing bundle to create a longer or thicker bolster. If it's too large, then you'll need to scale back on your filling. Ultimately, though, the size of the finished product should be determined by your body and your needs.


Many yoga practitioners find 24 inches long by eight inches high and ideal height for well-supported forward bends and a deep chest opening.Many yoga practitioners prefer a smaller bolster for supporting the neck, knees, and spine. If you want a smaller bolster, adjust your bolster to measure 16 inches long and five to six inches high., If you're using a 3/4 yard piece of cloth, lay the filling down at one edge of the cloth and wrap the filling tightly inside the cloth.For smooth ends on the bolster, you'll also need to measure two round end caps. To measure the end caps, trace a medium- to large-sized dinner plate on a piece of cloth. If it is an adequate size for your bolster, trace a second circle using the same dinner plate to use as the other end cap., Sew the bolster shut if you're satisfied with the size and will not need to access the materials inside. If you may need the towels or blankets that you used as filling, consider using string or rubber bands to tie the bolster shut.


If you're using a pillow case and want to make it a permanent bolster, you can simply sew the open end closed.If you're using end caps, sew them in place to cover each end of the rolled up bolster tube."

Determine if you should be doing child's pose.,
Make the pose comfortable for stiff joints.,
Increase the stretch of your torso.,
Rest your forehead on your hands.,
Use pillows and cushions.",How to Perform Child Pose in Yoga," It may help to start in downward facing dog position on a yoga mat. Kneel and bring your big toes together so they're touching. Move your knees apart so they're about hip-distance apart.Some instructors recommend keeping your knees together. While you can do this, moving your knees apart will allow you to stretch deeper into the pose.;
, Exhale slowly and move your bottom down so that it rests between your thighs (or on top of your ankles, if keeping your knees together).You should feel your tailbone lengthen away from your pelvis.

, Place your hands on the mat in front of you. Lean forward until your chest is resting on your thighs and your forehead touches the floor. Your back should be raised up and the muscles in your neck should be lengthened.


If you're flexible, you may not need to put your hands in front of you to guide you down to the mat. Simply control your torso as you bend forward.

, You can bring your arms to your sides so that they stay snug with your torso. This can help you feel more relaxed and secure. You could also bring your arms directly out in front of you.Keeping your arms in front can help you stretch and keep your tailbone lengthened.

, Rest in child's pose while you take slow breaths into your belly. You can hold this pose for 30 seconds to a few minutes. Relax and focus on your breathing and awareness while in child's pose.To release the pose, inhale while bringing your torso back up. You should feel your tailbone press down while you raise yourself back up to sitting position.

, Child's pose is one of the most basic yoga poses and most individuals can successfully perform the pose. But, there are some people who should not do child's pose. Avoid doing child's pose if:You're pregnant
You have diarrhea
You have ankle problems
You've had a knee injury or problems with cartilage
You have high blood pressure or ear or eye infections

, The main goal of doing this pose is to relax and focus in comfort. If you find that your joints are stiff, making the pose uncomfortable, skip kneeling before moving into the pose. Instead, start by sitting cross-legged in easy pose or kneeling with your bottom over a block in hero pose. These can reduce the amount of pressure you're putting on your joints.You might feel more comfortable doing this pose in the evening since your body is stiffer in the morning and loosens up as the day goes on.

, While this is mainly a resting pose, you can also do child's pose to stretch the muscles in your torso. To do so, bring your arms out in front of you while lifting your bottom up a little bit. Stretch your arms forward as you bring your shoulder blades back. Keep your arms where they are and sit your bottom back down on your heels or as far back as it will go.This stretch is also a helpful way to do the pose if you have a larger body or have trouble putting weight on your knees.

, If you're having trouble bringing your forehead completely down to the floor, don't overextend yourself. You could pull a muscle. Instead, bring your arms together so that your hands meet in the middle. Ball your hands into fists and rest your forehead on your fists instead of the floor.If you're still having trouble, stack your fists on top of each other to further raise your arms off the ground.

, You can strategically place rolled up towels, small cushions or pillows to support your limbs during deep stretches. For example, you might want to fold a thick blanket under your back thighs and calves if sitting on your ankles is uncomfortable.You could also place a pillow under your bottom so that it rests on your ankles. This can help if you feel like you're unbalanced and might fall forward while doing the pose.

Consult a doctor before making any major lifestyle changes.",How to Lose Weight with Yoga," Yoga in and of itself does not burn a lot of calories. However, hybrid yoga classes often combine yoga with forms of aerobics. This may result in a higher caloric burn, allowing you to burn more calories and possibly lose weight with yoga.Koga classes combine yoga with kickboxing. The fast-paced nature of kickboxing may burn more calories than yoga alone.
Yoga classes that combine with dance and cardio, with names such as ""Yoga Booty Ballet,"" encourage fast-paced movements. If you can find classes like these, you may be able to lose weight with yoga.
Look into classes at a local YMCA or health center. See if you can find anything relevant to your interests, and that combines yoga with more vigorous fitness routines.;
, Power yoga is a form of yoga that encourages complicated athletic poses. You focus on muscle groups you need to use for activities like cycling, running, and weight lifting. If you do power yoga a few times a week, you can increase your strength and stamina when you engage in aerobic activities. This could lead to a higher calorie burn during other forms of exercise, and when you move throughout the day., Acro-yoga is a form of yoga that combines yoga with acrobatic moves. It's a more intense form of yoga than other practices, and calls for more demanding moves. It may burn more calories than regular yoga, so it may work well for weight loss.


See if you can find a yoga studio in your area that offers acro-yoga courses.
Be careful if you're new to yoga, however. The moves can be very demanding, and you don't want to strain yourself if you've never tried yoga before. You may want to start with a more basic class and work your way up to acro-yoga.

, Hot yoga, sometimes referred to as Bikram yoga, may help with quick weight loss. Bikram yoga is typically done in a classroom setting in a room heated to 105 °F (40.6 °C) with increased humidity. Bikram yoga can help you shed some unwanted water weight. However, evidence is mixed as to whether or not Bikram yoga helps with weight loss long term.Bikram yoga sessions are long, typically 90 minutes in length. Longer sessions make for more weight loss, as more calories will be burned.
Bikram classes are intense. Typically, there are 26 poses which you must go through twice. You hold the poses for 20 seconds the first time, and 10 seconds the next time.
Look for a Bikram yoga class near you. See if the enrollment fee is affordable for you. Regular Bikram yoga could eventually lead to weight loss.

, Yoga poses are often slow-moving, so the weight loss tends to be less overall. You'll burn more calories during 20 minutes of aerobics than 20 minutes of yoga. This is why 90 minute sessions are key if you want yoga to be a major component of your weight loss strategy. You need longer sessions to burn more calories and achieve your goals.You should also go for fast-paced yoga. Opt for continual, flowing yoga moves that encourage you to stay in motion throughout the session.
You can find yoga routines online, or enroll in a yoga class.

, While yoga is not necessarily a primary form of aerobic exercise, it can help with weight training. Building your muscles and core can help you strengthen your body. This can provide you with more endurance during aerobic exercise, so your body is able to go longer during aerobic routines.The downward dog position can help you build muscle, and you can move from this position to other similar poses. Stand with your feet together and move forward, bending at your hips, until your fingertips or palms are at either side of your feet. Bend your knees and then place your palms flat on your yoga mat, keeping them shoulder width apart. Then move your feet back slightly and raise your tailbone in the air.
Get on all fours. Your knees should align with your hips, and your hands should be under your shoulders. Pull in your abs and bend your elbows 45 degrees, doing a half pushup. Rise back up and repeat a series of half push-ups until you feel tired.
Straighten your arms and bring your tailbone down towards your heels, allowing the backs of your thighs to rest on your calves. Hold for a few breaths, and return to downward dog.

, You can add a series of quick circuit yoga poses at the end of an aerobics routine. This can add some muscle building and additional cardio to a workout. Choose a series of 4 or 5 poses that work for you and do them in a certain order after working out.You could start in mountain pose. This means standing up tall and straight with your feet held together and your hands stretched over your head. Breathe in and out as you reach upward.
From here, move your arms to the ground until your palms or fingertips are in front of your feet. Exhale as you lean forward. Tilt your head down and stretch your calves upward.
Look forward, lift your torso up, and keep your back flat. Push your hips back and transition into downward dog. Then, repeat the circuit.

, Yoga is not easy and can cause a lot of strain to various muscle groups. Certain positions may not be appropriate for beginners. If you've never done yoga before, it's best to start in a class. A qualified instructor can help you determine your present fitness level and give you advice and feedback on what moves are safe for you. Check your local yellow pages, or browse the internet, to find yoga instructors and classes in your area., Yoga helps you foster a sense of awareness about yourself and your body. This can help you become more mindful when you eat, allowing you to be more aware of when you're feeling full and satisfied.Remember how to be in the present moment when you eat, and work on practicing mindful eating.First, work on making meal time a priority. Put away your cell phone and turn off the television set. Set the table, even if you're eating alone, so you can focus solely on the food.
Eat slowly. You want to make sure you savor each bite and enjoy the texture and flavor of the food. Try to chew each bite very slowly and pay attention to how the food tastes in your mouth, as well as the textures. Try taking smaller bites and pausing between bites to think.
Think about the food you're eating. Try to be aware of where it came from. Who grew these vegetables? Think about the farms from which animal products came. Try to think about food as sustaining and nourishing rather than a convenience or a splurge.

, Yoga also teaches you to become more aware of your body. This can help you be more aware of when you want food, and be more aware of the kinds of food you need to feel fulfilled.Many people who diet strive to be in control of their body or their eating habits. However, yoga preaches that your body should control you. Yoga courses encourage you to listen to your body and its needs.
As you begin engaging in yoga regularly, you'll find you're more aware of what you want and need on a daily basis. You may find yourself eating when you're hungry instead of when you're bored, as you're paying attention to your body's signs. You may also go for healthier foods, as you'll be longing for nourishment over taste and convenience.
Before you eat, stop and think to yourself, ""Why am I eating? Do I feel hungry?"" If you're eating for a reason other than hunger, such as stress, try to find a different way to cope. Eat only when you feel you need food to sustain yourself.

, Stress can cause weight gain for a variety of reasons. People who are stressed tend to eat emotionally, and may eat unhealthy foods they would otherwise avoid.Doing yoga regularly can help you reduce your overall stress, as yoga encourages you to stay in the present moment and be aware and accepting of yourself. Practice yoga regularly with the aim of reducing stress to help you lose weight.In addition to yoga, consider incorporating regular meditation into your day-to-day life. You can find meditation routines online, or take a meditation class at a local community center. Meditation can also help you reduce life stress, resulting in a better chance at weight loss.

, It's hard to lose weight doing only yoga, as it does not burn as many calories as other traditional forms of exercise. If you weigh 150 pounds, you'll burn 170 calories for an hour of yoga. However, if you do an hour of aerobics, you'll burn 340 calories. While yoga has many benefits for weight loss, such as increasing the strength of core muscles and potentially preventing emotional eating, you should supplement yoga with regular cardio and aerobic activity.Pick an activity you like to do, as you'll be more likely to stick to it. If you've never enjoyed running, you probably won't go for a jog every morning. However, if you love riding your bike, you'll be more likely to stick to your routine.
Always warm up and cool down before and after exercise.

, Diet is one of the main factors when it comes to weight loss. In fact, diet may have a bigger impact on weight loss than exercise. Strive for a healthy, low-calorie diet, that is rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean meats.Opt for variety. This will provide you with a range of nutrients, and prevent boredom. Go for many different kinds of fruits and vegetable, striving for a colorful shopping basket.
Whole-grains are always better over processed carbs. Strive to get your protein from lean meats, legumes, and nuts over fattier meats. Stick to low-fat dairy over full fat varieties.

, If you're going to be making any lifestyle changes to lose weight, talk to a doctor first. You want to make sure your body is ready for a change given your medical history and current health. Make an appointment with your regular physician to talk over your diet and exercise plan. He or she can help you craft a diet that suits your particular needs.

Relax in child's pose.,
Modify warrior 2 to loosen your shoulders.",How to Loosen Tight Shoulders with Yoga1," This pose will help you open up your chest, neck, and shoulders to release tension. It also stretches your arms, legs, and torso for the ultimate full-body stretching experience.Start lying flat on your stomach on your yoga mat. Look ahead so that your chin is on the mat. Your arms should be down at your sides. Take a moment to get in touch with your breath.
Bend your knees as you exhale, trying to bring your heels as close as possible to your buttocks. Your knees should be about hip-distance apart. Reach back and grab your ankles.
As you inhale, lift your heels up, drawing your thighs and upper torso away from the mat. You are now in bow pose.
Hold the pose for 30 seconds, breathing slowly and softly. You won't be able to breathe as deeply because of the pressure on your torso, but avoid the inclination to hold your breath.
As you breathe, focus on drawing your shoulders down into your back, firming up your back. Think of drawing your tailbone towards the floor while lifting your heels and thighs higher.;
, Eagle pose stretches your shoulders and back, as well as helping build strength in your chest, back, and shoulders. By opening the joints, you can release tension as well as improve mobility in your shoulders.Start eagle pose from a standing position. This is a balancing pose, so it might be challenging for beginners. Bend your knees slightly and lift your right foot so you are balancing on your left foot.
Take a moment to ground yourself and find your balance, then cross your right thigh over your left – as though you are sitting cross-legged in an invisible chair.
Reach in front of you and cross your right arm over your left arm, then bend your elbows so your forearms are in front of your face. Bring your left hand around the inside of your right wrist so you can press your palms together.
As you squeeze your arms together, focus on dropping your shoulders down your back. Stay into the pose for between 15 and 30 seconds, breathing deeply. With every breath, try to sink a little deeper into the pose, bending your knees a little more.
If balancing poses aren't your strength, you can add eagle arms to another pose in which your body is more supported to get the same benefits for your shoulders without having to balance., Child's pose is a gentle pose that will help release the tension in your shoulders, neck, and back. This is a rest pose often used during yoga practice when you need to take a break and reconnect with your breath.Start by kneeling on a yoga mat or some other soft surface, such as a rug or blanket. Your knees should be spread wide, with your big toes touching beneath you. You can roll a blanket or towel under or behind your knees to relieve pressure if they bother you in this position – the point of this pose is to be comfortable.
Press your hips down toward your heels and fold over from the hips, resting your torso over or between your thighs. Rest your forehead on the mat, holding your arms at your sides with your palms facing up.
You can also go into extended child's pose by reaching your arms straight and forward past your head. Take care if you do this not to crunch your shoulders.
You should stay in this pose for 5 to 10 deep breaths, but the pose is gentle enough that you can stay here as long as you like, focusing on your breath.

, Warrior 2 stretches and strengthens your legs, ankles, chest, and shoulders. A simple arm modification can further deepen the stretch in your shoulders to help loosen them if they're tight.Start in a standing position, then on an exhale step or jump your feet until they're about four feet apart. Your right foot should be pointed to the right, your left foot forward, so that your right heel bisects the arch of your left foot.

Pull your other leg underneath you.,
Wear knee pads.,
Buy a kneeling mat.,
Avoid kneeling on bare knees.,
Do knee-strengthening exercises.,
Lose excess weight.,
See your doctor if you have persistent knee pain.",How to Kneel Comfortably," Extend one leg slightly behind you. Shift your weight to the foot of the opposite leg. Slowly lower your knee towards the ground., Once your knee is comfortably on the ground, shift weight back onto it. Make sure that the foot you have flat on the ground is pointing straight ahead, and that your legs are both bent at 90 degree angles. In addition, make sure that your hips are in line with your shoulders., If you do not wish to stay in a half-kneel position, shift your weight to the knee resting on the ground and gently pull your other leg under you. Bring your knees together and re-disperse your weight between them. Adjust your legs so that your knees are shoulder width apart, which will balance the weight more easily between knees., Knee pads are an excellent way of preventing the damage that can occur to your joints after prolonged periods of kneeling. Look for knee pads online or in hardware stores, where the selection will be geared towards kneeling rather than sport performance. Look for knee pads with a solid, non-slip outer casing and gel or foam cushioning.Make sure that the knee pads are large enough to adequately protect your knees. When in doubt, opt for a larger size.

, Kneeling mats are a good option for protecting your knees during long periods of kneeling in the same position. Garden mats are versatile pads that be used virtually anywhere (e.g. kneeling next to the tub to give your dog a bath). Look online, or in department stores for gardening kneeling mats, which range in size and materials (e.g. basic foam, gel cushioning, memory foam)., To protect your knees from scrapes or other skin abrasions, avoid kneeling on bare knees.

Talk to your doctor.,
Start with a flow between table pose and child's pose.,
Do the cat/cow sequence.,
Stretch with cow face pose.,
Find movements that you can do daily.",How to Ease Arthritis with Yoga1," Before you begin any yoga practice, whether you're joining a class or just learning a few easy poses to do at home, get your doctor's opinion. Your doctor may have certain restrictions they want you to observe, at least at first.If your doctor has specific restrictions or recommendations, get them in writing so you won't forget them and can show them to your yoga instructor if you join a class.
Tell your doctor if you have any other chronic health conditions or concerns that they don't know about. This will help them to more accurately assess your fitness for yoga.;
, Moving between table pose to child's pose helps stimulate your joint's natural lubricants. Over time, this sequence decreases joint pain particularly in your hips, knees, and shoulders.For table pose, get on a yoga mat on all fours. Your knees should be directly underneath your hips, your wrists directly below your shoulders. Cup your palms to reduce the pressure on your wrists.
Roll your shoulders away from your ears so that your shoulder blades line up down your spine. Flatten your back, tucking in your tailbone. Your body should be shaped roughly like a table.
Tuck your head between your arms and slowly curl your back as you lower your hips until your buttocks are resting on your heels. If this is too hard on your knees at first, place a rolled towel or blanket behind your knees.
You can rest in child's pose, breathing deeply, or push back up into table pose and complete the sequence several times, with a breath for each movement.

, The cat/cow sequence is a staple of most beginner yoga classes, and helps open up and increase flexibility in your spine. This pose does put a little pressure on your wrists, so if you have wrist pain from arthritis you'll want to modify the pose.Get on your yoga mat on all fours, as you were in table position. On an inhale, arch your lower back and sink your belly down toward the floor. Roll your shoulders back and lift your head to gaze in front of you. This is the ""cow"" portion of the sequence.
As you exhale, curve your back upward, tucking in your tailbone. Lower your head, tucking your chin into your chest. This is the ""cat"" portion of the sequence, since you look something like a Halloween cat with an arched back.
Return to cow on your next inhale, then to cat with your exhale. Repeat the sequence through 10 to 20 breaths.

, With cow face pose you help open your spine and hips, as well as stretching your shoulders. If you're able to do the full pose, you'll benefit from increased circulation to your knees and ankles.Take a seated position, then bend your knees. Cross your right leg over your left, moving your feet just outside the opposite hip so that your knees are stacked in front of you. If you can't cross your legs this far without knee pain, you can simply sit cross-legged.
Make sure your back is neutral with your shoulders rolled back so that your shoulder blades are flowing down your back alongside your spine.
Extend your arms and rotate them inwardly, bending your right arm inwardly and under to rest parallel to your spine. Reach your left arm overhead and drop it down from the elbow. Clasp hands if you can reach that far without pain or discomfort. Otherwise, you can use a yoga strap to get the stretch you need.
Sit in this pose for 10 to 20 deep breaths, then release. Switch and do the pose again with your left leg over your right and your right arm overhead.

, Yoga is a gentle enough exercise that you can practice it every day. Most of the benefits you'll see from practicing yoga to ease your arthritis won't happen after one session. Rather, they accrue incrementally after several weeks of regular practice.When you start doing yoga, don't expect to see a lessening of your symptoms right away. In fact, you might feel worse when you first start because your muscles are sore – particularly if you haven't been very physically active.
If you experience soreness or discomfort, modify the poses so you can continue to do them on a regular basis.

Buy a couple of yoga blocks.,
Choose a thicker mat.,
Gather blankets or towels.,
Get a yoga strap or belt.,
Invest in a bolster.,
Incorporate wearable props.",How to Ease Arthritis with Yoga2," Yoga blocks are some of the most inexpensive yoga props out there. It makes sense to be two or three, especially if you are a beginning practitioner and have arthritis.Yoga blocks come in a standard size rectangle, but have three different heights depending on whether you lay the block flat or stand it on either edge. You also can stack the blocks if necessary.
Yoga blocks give you stability on poses where you might not be able to reach all the way. For example, if you can't do a full forward fold to place your hands flat on the floor, you can rest your hands on a yoga block at the right height.

, Yoga mats have a grippy surface to provide your hands and feet with plenty of traction during poses. The mats come in several different thicknesses. If you have joint pain, a thicker mat provides a little more padding.Since yoga mats typically aren't very expensive, you may want to get a couple in different thicknesses so you can try them out.
You also may want different thicknesses if you practice in different places. For example you might want more padding on a hard floor, but might be able to get away with a thinner mat on carpet.

, Although there are many companies that sell them, you don't necessarily need to buy special blankets or towels for your yoga practice. You simply need something lightweight.Towels are particularly helpful if you have problems with your hands or feet slipping on your mat. They also can be folded under your knees or hips to provide extra cushioning for your joints if you need it.
Blankets often are rolled and placed behind joints for cushioning. A smaller throw blanket typically will work better than a larger bed-sized blanket.

, Particularly if you have stiffness in your arms or shoulders, a strap is a good investment to start stretching and opening up those areas. Straps also can help you with balance, which will decrease stress on your joints.While there are several different lengths of straps, 10 feet is usually long enough without being too long.

, For extremely stiff joints, a bolster may help you find the proper alignment for a pose. Bolsters are essentially large, firm pillows, usually cylindrical in shape. Since they may be more expensive than other yoga props, make sure you need one before you go out and buy it.For example, if you have difficulty getting into child's pose because of knee or hip pain, you might benefit from a bolster. You can either place it across your heels so you can rest your hips on it, or place it between your knees and use it to rest your torso.

, You can buy wearable yoga accessories to keep your hands or feet from getting slippery, or to brace or cushion your joints. You also may have a sleeve or brace prescribed or recommended by your doctor.If you want to use a wearable yoga accessory, you may want to run it by your doctor first. While most are designed not to restrict movement in any way, it may exacerbate your particular condition.

Senior centers or assisted living facilities also may offer arthritis for yoga classes that are open to the public.

, Ideally, if you want to practice yoga to ease your arthritis symptoms, you should find a teacher who has documented training and experience working with yoga for arthritis.For example, in the United States, look for an instructor who is registered with Yoga Alliance and has received training or certification with the organization Yoga for Arthritis.
Ask each instructors to show you documentation of their training and any certifications they have, and talk to them about how long they've been a yoga instructor and how long they've been teaching people with arthritis.

, The only way to know for sure if a yoga class is going to be right for you is to observe it in action. Pay attention to the instructor's teaching style and methods, and how they interact with the students.Instructors that demonstrate modifications for poses, rather than just talking about them, may be best if you are just getting started in yoga. Sometimes it is easier to see how the modification works.
You also want to pay attention to the other people in the class and how they interact with each other. Decide if they seem like people you would get along with.

, Before you sign up for a yoga class, you want to make sure the yoga instructor is someone from whom you can take instruction. They should be easy to talk to and open to your questions.If you encounter a yoga instructor who is dismissive of your concerns or doesn't seem willing to answer questions, you probably want to look elsewhere.
Ask the instructor to share some of their experiences in teaching yoga to people with arthritis. Talk to them about your particular condition and find out if they've taught students with similar symptoms.

, Your knee joint is the most important weight bearing joint in your body and is subjected to repeated wear and tear every day.


Some of the common causes of knee pain include overuse, a knee injury, a dislocated kneecap and an altered gait where you tend to stress your knees more, as well as aging and certain medications.
Knee pain can also be caused by medical conditions involving the knee joints, the tissues and the bones that surround the knees.

, If your knee joint is stressed, damaged, or over used, it can undergo various changes like inflammation, loss of the lubricating synovial fluid that lines the joints and cartilages and weakness of the muscles that support the joint. These symptoms can then lead to osteoarthritis in your knee.


Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis in the knee. It is a degenerative,""wear-and-tear"" type of arthritis that occurs most often in people 50 years of age and older, but may occur in younger people, too., Yoga stretches your muscles and joints gradually, over a period of breaths and through a series of poses, which stimulates positive growth in them. These poses also stretch the tendons and ligaments surrounding the knee joint, thereby preventing ligament tears around the joint and the potential for knee surgery to correct a torn ligament.


Yoga also helps to relax and stretch inflamed tissues, thereby encouraging circulation, which helps to address knee pain.
Making yoga a part of your regular exercise regimen will help to manage your osteoarthritis and keep you knee joint supple and nimble as you age.
In fact, yoga has been found to be beneficial for people recovering from knee surgery as it has shown positive results in post surgery care for pain and mobility of a recovering knee joint., Yoga is not all about poses. It also involves focused breathing as you perform a pose.

If you are a first time practitioner or new to yoga and pregnant, you should only do gentle, prenatal yoga to prevent any harm or risk to your pregnancy.

Like your yoga poses, you may find that modified exercises can help prevent back pain and injury.

Talk about the importance of deep breathing and patience.",How to Do Yoga with Your Kids," Kids love to play games. Making your yoga session into a game may help entice your child to participate in a yoga session with you.There are a variety of games that you can do with yoga like:


Using yoga cards. Yoga cards are similar to a deck of playing cards. Instead of numbers and suits there are different yoga poses. You can purchase these or make your own. Let your child pull the next card or line up a set of cards to use in your yoga routine.
Play a counting game. With yoga, you're supposed to hold poses for a certain amount of time. Have your child practice counting skills by counting backwards or counting by multiples.
Play ""yogi says"". Just like the game Simon Says, play ""yogi says"" with your child. Either you or your child can call out the pose and be the ""yogi.""
Use stickers. Teach your child the difference between the left and right sides of their body. You can get them stickers to put on their feet or hands or also let them use washable markers to draw on their feet and hands.;
, Yoga can be difficult for anyone - child or adult. With children, it's important to stay positive during your yoga routine. This can help encourage your child as they learn some of the more difficult yoga poses.Whenever your child does a pose correctly, learns a more difficult pose or even completes a yoga session with you, compliment them on their achievements.
Also be encouraging and motivating when your child cannot complete a pose or doesn't enjoy a particular yoga session. This will help teach them that even though they weren't successful, it's great they tried something new.
It's also important to talk positively about yoga and exercise in general. This can help teach your child by example that regular yoga practice is an important part of a healthy lifestyle.

, If you've ever practiced yoga before, you're probably well aware that some poses are extremely difficult. If you want your child to be involved in yoga, you'll need to start out with simple and easy poses.You want your child to feel like they can do yoga successfully. You don't want to discourage them by choosing poses they may not be able to do physically.
Also have your child watch you perform different yoga poses. Having them be able to see you get into and out of poses can be helpful as they learn.
When you start a yoga practice with your child, also keep the time limit short and only do a few poses. It might be overwhelming to do 20 or 30 poses. Go for 10 poses or so to start with.

, If your child begins to show some interest in yoga, consider getting them some yoga gear. This might be a fun part for them as they get to have their own mat or block to use.


Although kids don't necessarily need their own materials, you can use this to encourage them to practice more regularly.
For example, if they do yoga with you every Saturday morning, they can pick out their own yoga mat. Of they might want a yoga outfit that is similar to yours.
Make sure your child has comfortable and loose fitting clothing when they practice yoga. If they're wearing something restrictive it might prevent them from being able to get in and out of a pose.
Although kids are smaller, they don't need a special sized mat or block to perform yoga. Traditional sized items will work well.

, Children's yoga has become much more popular. There are yoga classes designed specifically for kids and also many DVD's that are for children.


Consider researching local yoga studios for kids yoga classes. These are usually a little bit cheaper than a traditional yoga class. In addition, there's usually multiple kids per class and your child may enjoy meeting and making new friends.
If you want to do yoga with your kids, look for ""mommy and me"" classes or parent/child classes that focuses on poses done together.
If you cannot find a local yoga studio offering these specialized classes, there are DVD's that you can purchase (or even online videos) that you can use instead.

, Boat pose is a great pose for kids. It's fairly easy and can be done with a partner as well. To pass the time while you're holding this pose, sing ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat"" with your child.To do boat pose have your child mimic your moves:


Start by sitting with your legs straight out in front of you. Lean your torso back slightly so your abdominal muscles are engaged.
Slowly lift up your legs so they're about a foot off the ground. Extend your arms straight in front of you so your hands are pointed towards your knees.
If this is too difficult for you or your child, you can bend your knees. Your shins should be parallel to the floor.
Make this a partner pose, by having your child perform this move facing you. Rest the bottoms of your feet together as you hold this pose.

, This is a fun and simple pose for kids to try.Have them mimic you completing this pose.


Start by being on your hands and knees on your mat. Press into your palms and push your tail bone up into the air so you're in a upside down ""v"" shape.
As you push your hips into the air try to push your heels down to the floor. They do not need to touch the floor in order to do this pose correctly. Hold this pose for a few moments.
If your child is little enough, they can do their downward dog underneath of you after you've gotten into this pose.

, Sun bathing rock is a less common pose, but a great one to do with your child. It's easy and simple to follow and allows both of you to do this pose together.To start this pose, the adult or parent should get into child's pose on the mat. Sit on bent knees and lean your torso over your knees. Extend your arms out in front of you.
Have your child drape their body over your back. They should be facing upwards towards the ceiling.
Your child should stretch their arms open wide out to the side of their body. Have them relax their legs. Encourage your child to relax and open up the front of their body. Hold this pose for a few moments.

, This is a great pose for kids as the idea of being a warrior might be fun for them. In addition, its fairly simple and easy to follow.Start this pose by standing up straight on your mat. Lunge your right foot forward and bend your knee so your thigh is almost parallel to the floor. Keep your right foot facing forward.
Your left leg should be extended backward behind your body. Keep this leg straight. However, turn your left foot out about 45 degrees away from your leg.
While keeping your torso straight, lift your right arm straight out in front of you. Lift your left arm straight out behind you. Hold this pose for a few moments.
After holding this pose on the right side, complete this same pose on the left side as well.

, Tree pose is a fairly simple pose and is great for kids. Many children like the idea of pretending to be a tree and being challenged to balance on one leg.Start this pose by standing up straight on your mat with feet hip width apart. Slowly pull up your right foot and place it either on the inside of your left thigh or your left calf. It's slightly easier to hold this pose if your foot rests on your calf.
As you balance, bring your hands into a prayer position. Your hands should rest right in front of your heart. Hold this pose for a few moments.
After you've completed this pose on the right side, switch and hold this pose on the left side as well.

, Some of the concepts that are a part of yoga may be too advanced or difficult for children (like meditating for 15-20 minutes at a time). However, they can still use some key items if you relate them to their lives.


Bringing focus to poses and to meditations or intentions is a key practice of yoga. Although that concept may be a little much for some children, they understand the concept of needing to focus.
Teach them to focus during their poses. Whether it's focusing on their balance or strength to hold a pose, this is a great skill for children to learn.
Tell them that learning to focus can help them pay attention in school, do well with their homework or improve in a sport.

, Like adults, children are encouraged when they can see the benefit of doing physical activity. Show them how yoga can strengthen their body overtime.Have your child (possibly with your help) write down some poses that are little difficult to do or ones they cannot do. After a few yoga sessions, show them how they've improved by being able to do those difficult poses.
Relate their improved fitness to their lives. Talk about how they may be able to do better with gym tests like the ""sit and reach"" or pull-up challenges. They may even see improvements in favorite activities like biking or climbing as well.

, One well known and sometimes difficult concept of yoga is deep breathing and patience. This is a hard skill for adults, but also difficult for children. Show them how regular practice can help improve their patience.As you practice yoga with your child, talk about the patience it takes to learn different poses. Or the patience it takes to slowly become stronger and get better at certain poses.
Teach them how to breathe deeply during their your yoga routines. Also show them how they can use deep breathing to calm down, to focus or to help them be more patient.
You may tell them to do deep breathing before taking a test or when they're getting up in front of the class for a presentation.

Start with a wide-angle seated forward bend.,
Explore child's pose with a partner.,
Progress to a partnered downward facing dog.,
Open up your back with an assisted backbend.,
Try boat pose with your partner.,
Work on your balance with a partner tree.",How to Do Yoga with a Partner1," A wide-angle seated forward bend is an easy pose to start off with that will give both you and your partner a good full body stretch. Allow the least flexible partner to come into position first.From a sitting position facing your partner, spread your legs out as far as you comfortably can. Scoot forward if necessary so that you and your partner's feet are touching. Press the soles of your feet together.
Reach forward and grasp your partner's hands. Take a few deep breaths, and then allow yourself to fold forward as your partner leans back. Hold the stretch for 5 to 10 deep breaths.
Return to center, then lean back yourself, pulling your partner towards you.;
, Child's pose enables each partner to relax, as well as providing a great massage and release of tension for your lower back. For this pose, one of you will be in child's pose while the other is active.To get into child's pose, kneel on the floor with your big toes touching and your knees spread apart. The wider your knees, the easier it will be to lower all the way to the floor. Hinge forward from the hips and fold over your legs, reaching your arms overhead.
Your partner then stands between your hands. Reach out and grab your partner's ankles. Your partner will lean forward and walk their hands down your back until they are resting on your lower back. Then your partner will slowly shift their weight forward, allowing a gentle release for your lower back.
Stay in the pose for 5 to 10 breaths. When your partner stands, swap roles and do the pose again so you both get the lower-back release.

, Partnered downward facing dog can be dangerous if either you or your partner are not strong and somewhat experienced yoga practitioners. If you're ready, the pose provides a deep full body stretch and can be very relaxing.Start in downward facing dog. You can keep your feet together or spread them apart, whichever is more comfortable for you and makes you feel more stable.
Your partner stands with their feet above your head and then folds forward to the mat, pressing their palms firmly against the mat. If your partner cannot do a full forward fold, they should not attempt this pose.
Your partner slowly walks their feet up your back until they get to your low back, and then they press their feet into your low back so that they are also in a downward facing dog position.
Breathe together, holding the pose for 5 to 10 breaths, then carefully come out of the pose and switch positions.

, An assisted backbend is a fun way to get a good stretch in your chest and back. However, you may not want to try this pose if either you or your partner has back problems or is recovering from a recent back injury.Stand back to back with your partner. Hook your partner's elbows on either side. Take a few deep breaths together.
If you're serving as the base, bend your knees and lean forward slowly, engaging your core. Continue bending forward, hinging at the hips, until your partner's feet are lifted off the ground. Hold the pose for three to five deep breaths, then slowly raise up until your partner is standing.
If you're the partner on top, lean back and focus on opening up your chest and shoulders. Allow your legs and feet to drop to get a deeper spinal stretch. Once you return to stand, make sure you switch and take a turn as the base so your partner gets the stretch as well.

, Doing boat pose with a partner changes the focus of the posture. When you do boat pose with your partner, it helps stretch and lengthen your hamstrings.Start by sitting facing your partner. You should be about three feet away from each other with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor in front of you.
Simultaneously, you and your partner should reach forward and grasp hands on either side of your legs. Your arms should be fully extended.
Lift your legs so that they are straight, and press the soles of your feet against the soles of your partner's feet. You may have to move around a little to adjust so this is comfortable for both of you.
Hold the pose for 5 to 10 deep breaths, pulling gently on your partner's hands while simultaneously pressing against the soles of their feet.

, Even if you find tree pose too difficult a balance to do on your own, you can probably do a partner tree. The partner tree makes balancing easier because you and your partner support each other.Stand next to your partner and move into tree pose. Each of you will lift your outer leg, bending it at the knee, and place the sole of your foot on the inner thigh of your other leg. Press against each other's sides if you need to until you find your balance.
Wrap your arms around each other's waists to find the support you need to balance in tree pose. Reach your outer arms up and overhead. Leaning slightly toward your partner, curve your arm and see if you can connect palms. Hold the pose for 5 to 10 deep breaths, then release and swap sides so you can do the other leg.

Look for a theme that fits.,
Ask to sit in on a class.,
Interview the instructor of the class.,
Talk to other students in the class.",How to Do Yoga with a Partner2," You can find partner yoga classes near you at yoga studios, gyms, fitness centers, and maybe even your local community center. Some classes may be open to any partners, while others may be limited to married couples.You don't have to be in a romantic relationship with your partner to go to a partner yoga class, even if it's advertised as ""couples yoga."" In many partner classes, you can even come alone – which can be beneficial if you haven't yet decided on a partner but still want to try partner yoga.

, There are many different types of partner yoga classes, and each yoga instructor has their own style and methods of teaching. Observing a class can help you determine if it would work for you and your partner.Ideally, you want to try to watch at least two or three classes, so you can compare and contrast. However, always be open to the option that you might fall in love with the first class you visit and not feel the need to go anywhere else.
Pay attention to the instructor's style and teaching methods, as well as the other people in the class. Not only do you and your partner want to get along with the instructor, you want to be able to get along with the other people in the class as well.
Talk to your partner about your impressions of classes you sit in on, and mention anything you liked in particular as well as anything you didn't like.

, Before you sign up for a class, get an understanding of the instructor's background and experience. Ask them lots of questions to find out how long they've been teaching partner yoga.Interviewing the instructor also is a good way to determine whether your personalities mesh. If you (or your partner) has a personality clash with the instructor, you likely won't get much out of the class.
Try to avoid making a decision about the class on the spot, unless you and your partner are both enthusiastic about it. Generally it's better to visit two or three classes and then sit down and discuss them with your partner before committing.

, Other students can relay their experiences in the class and their opinion of the instructor. You also can find out more about who the other students are so you can get a better idea of whether you and your partner would fit in.For example, if the other students in the class are all married couples, you and your partner might not feel comfortable if the two of you are just platonic friends. This is something you need to talk about with your partner.
If one of you feels comfortable in a class but the other does not, choose another class. To get any benefit from partner yoga, both of you must be in an environment where you feel comfortable.

Find someone similar in size to you.,
Assess how well you communicate.,
Discuss physical boundaries.,
Determine which of you is more flexible.,
Trust your partner.",How to Do Yoga with a Partner3," Especially if you are just getting started with partner yoga, you may find many of the poses easier if you and your partner are of similar height and weight.Keep in mind that many partner yoga poses require you to support your partner's weight. If you can't do this, you may need to work with someone else.
Other poses require you to reach around or through each other's bodies. Being of similar size and body type will make it easier for you to reach.

, To be a good yoga partner, the person you choose must be someone with whom you have no problem sharing and communicating openly. Partner yoga will be difficult if you have problems being vulnerable with the person.In partner yoga, communication is both verbal and nonverbal. The best partners can understand nonverbal communication from their partner's body as well as they can with their own body.
Sitting together with palms touching and meditating is a good way to open up the nonverbal lines of communication.

, Partner yoga requires you and your partner to be close to one another physically. An emotional release also could result in an uncomfortable or awkward situation between you and your partner unless you are comfortable with each other physically.If either of you have particular sensitivities, you should discuss these before you start practicing together. For example, maybe the backs of your knees are extremely ticklish and you don't like being touched there.
You also need to let each other know of any injuries that might affect your ability to make certain movements or perform certain poses.

, When you and your partner are practicing yoga, generally the partner who is least flexible will take the lead on the pose. This enables them to make any adjustments that might be necessary for their comfort.You may be more flexible in some areas than others. For example, you may have open and flexible hips, but tight shoulders. If your partner was the opposite, then you would take the lead on any poses that stretched the shoulders, while your partner took the lead on any hip-opening poses.

, When doing partner yoga, you won't be able to pull off a lot of the poses unless the two of you trust each other. If you have a partner who you already know well, this may not be an issue. If your partner is a relative stranger, you have to learn to let go and allow them to support you.Finding trust requires being able to let go and accept support from your partner. This can be somewhat like the ""trust exercises"" in which you fall backward into someone's arms.
Don't worry if you have a hard time finding trust at first. Simply communicate with your partner and be open about your issues.

Consider partner yoga.,
Try partner boat pose.,
Try supported half lotus pose.,
Work on a partner backbend.,
Work on a thick tree pose.,
Keep your spine better aligned in warrior II pose.,
Try a group pose.",How to Do Yoga with Your Friends1," Partner yoga uses poses that you can do together with a friend or lover. With these poses, you use each other's bodies to stretch yourself that much farther. Plus, working together in these poses can bring you closer together., Sit in the floor facing each other. Your toes should be close together, and your knees should be bent. Grab hands, and push the bottom of your feet together. Extend your legs upward, straightening out your legs and making a triangle. Hold the position for about 5 seconds.







, Lotus pose is where you sit cross-legged on the floor with your back straight. Doing it with a partner can make it easier because you can sit back to back, supporting each other and helping to keep your spines aligned.








Sit on the floor back to back with your partner. Pull your legs up to you in a cross-legged position. Pull one foot up on to your thigh. Pull the other foot on top of the first leg with the foot resting on the other thigh. If you haven't done lotus before, try to work on some hip-opening positions first.Align you spine with your partner, making sure to keep it straight. Rest your hands on your legs

, This pose gives both partners a chance to stretch out their backs. It starts by having one person lay face down on the floor. The other partner should place one foot on either side of the other person's hips, facing the person's head.








The person on the ground lifts their arms up slightly (behind their back), and the person standing up grabs hold of them. The person standing up gently lifts up on the arms, pulling up the shoulder's of the person on the ground, creating a backbend.
At the same time, the person standing up leans back far enough to create a backbend of their own, using the weight of the person on the ground to help hold themselves up.
Don't forget to switch out positions.

, This pose is done standing up. Face the same direction as your partner. Move your hips together. With your hips touching, each of you bring the opposite leg up, resting the bottom of your foot on your inner thigh. Your arms can either wrap around each other's waist (with the outside arm coming together with your partner's, palms flat) or be extended straight upward (inner arms) and at an angle upwards (outer arm).







, From standing, you can move into warrior II pose by leaving your left foot in place and stepping the right foot out to the right side of your body. Your right foot should be perpendicular to your left foot, but your legs should still be in a line. Your right knee is bent, and your left leg is straight. Stretch your arms out straight from your body over each leg, and turn your head toward your right leg.








To move into this pose with a partner, stand left shoulder to left shoulder, looking opposite ways. Brace your left feet against each other's and step out with your right. Grasp your left arms together at the forearm while straightening your other arm. Use each other's weight to gently stretch your back/left arm.

, You can also try group poses. One that works well in a group is flower pose. Sit in a circle, facing inward. Start with cobbler pose. Bring the bottoms of your feet together in front of you with your knees bent. Make sure to keep your spine straight.Next, move into flower pose. Move each arm under a leg, with palms facing up. Puff your chest out, moving your shoulder blades together, and gently lift your legs into the air. You can even touch feet with the people next to you.

Use recorded instruction.,
Research yoga together.,
Make it a regular practice.",How to Do Yoga with Your Friends2," If you and your friends are both looking to save a little money, try using yoga workouts on the internet, streaming services, or DVDs. You can meet at someone's house once or twice a week and use the video to do yoga together.While you can find many free videos online, you can also purchase longer instructional videos.

, Another option is to use things like yoga websites and books to help learn the poses. You can take turns leading the group through different poses. Just make sure everyone is careful not to push themselves too far. You can strain muscles doing yoga., If you're trying to incorporate more yoga into your life by doing it with friends, try making it a regular part of your schedule. For instance, you could meet up 3 times a week before work at your local park or gym to do yoga together. That way, you can all encourage each other to be more focused on yoga in your lives."

Find a friend with a similar personality.,
Look for classes in your area.,
Compromise on a class.,
Hold each other accountable.,
Don't give up too quickly.",How to Do Yoga with Your Friends3," One way to make joining a class together easier is to pick someone who has a similar personality and who's hoping to get similar things from a yoga class. That way, you'll have an easier time agreeing on which class is best to take.However, having a similar personality isn't the only way to choose a yoga partner. You can also choose by who has similar exercise goals or pick someone who can get you excited about yoga and vice versa.

, Many gyms offer yoga classes, but you'll also find studios that are exclusively for yoga. Some yoga classes are even offered in places like parks or art museums. Check with your local gyms and yoga studios, and watch community boards to find places that offer classes.

, Even if you do find a friend with a similar personality, you're probably still going to need to make some compromises on what type of class you join together. Maybe they prefer a class with hip-hop music, and you like a quieter venue. Perhaps you can switch off. Alternatively, if you're not into the philosophical side of yoga and they prefers an instructor who focuses on that, just learn to tune out what you don't need.You may also need to compromise on time and location.

, One of the benefits of joining with a friend is you can be each other's accountability partners. That is, if you don't show up to class, your friend will notice. In fact, you can have a deal to check up on each other when either one of you doesn't show., If you're both new to yoga, you may find the practice harder than expected. However, don't be too quick to give it up. You'll likely find that you adapt quickly. Plus, you'll begin to notice changes in your body, such as becoming more flexible."
"
Join them where they are.,
Allay their fears.,
Go through a few poses beforehand.,
Give them the details.,
Try a trade off.,
Skip the manipulation.",How to Do Yoga with Your Friends4," That is, don't encourage them to try yoga, then send them off to a beginner's class by themselves. Join a class with them. Also, make them feel more at ease by doing things like finding a place in back at class so they won't feel like they are in the spotlight.Find a free or cheap class for them to make yoga even more enticing.Also, make sure to pick a class that fits into their schedule so they can make time for it. It also helps if they don't have to go too far out of their way, distance-wise., Most beginners think they aren't coordinated or balanced enough to take yoga. When looking at yoga poses, it can seem pretty intimidating to a beginner. Remind them that everyone starts out feeling that way, not flexible or balanced enough.Also, tell them that one of the points of yoga is to increase those skills. Doing yoga makes you more flexible and increases your balance.

, Even if you're not a yoga teacher, you can help your friend feel more comfortable by showing them a few poses. Walk your friend through a few of them just so they get the feel of what it's like. Doing a few poses ahead time can make them feel less embarrassed when they do go to class because they now have at least some idea of what to do., Some people may do better if you walk them through a class, as well. You don't need to go through every pose. Rather, you just talk about what they should do beforehand, how a class proceeds, what they'll need, how long they can expect to be doing each part of the class, and what they should do afterwards.For example, tell them it's a good idea to eat a snack and find some comfortable clothes beforehand. Then talk about what they'll do at the studio, such take off their shoes and find a place to set their mat down to do yoga.

, One way you can encourage someone to try yoga is to offer a trade. That is, you could offer to do something they love to do with them in exchange for them trying yoga. You could say, ""Hey, I'll try a belly dancing class if you'll try a yoga class!"" That way, you'll both be the new kid, just in different situations., If you ask your friend to join you and they say ""no,"" it's best to let it go. No one wants to have a salesperson for a friend, and if you keep pushing too hard on getting them to come to yoga, you may find they don't want to hang out with you as much."

However, if you want to start on your own there are a few poses that you can do yourself to help acclimate you to yoga practice.;
, When you first see the mountain pose, you may think it doesn't look like a yoga pose at all. But the mountain pose can strengthen your thighs and core, as well as helping lengthen your spine.To do the mountain pose, stand up straight with your legs and feet together. Your arms should be at your side with your palms facing forward. Keep your core and thighs engaged and active.
Spread your toes and focus on ensuring that all four corners of your feet are touching your yoga mat or the floor. Keep your spine long, rolling your shoulders back and away from your ears.
Breathe deeply, close your eyes, and slowly move your hands in front of you, pressing them together at the center of your chest. Maintain this position for three breaths before slowly moving your hands back to your sides.

, It's simple to transition between the mountain pose and the standing side lean. This pose stretches and lengthens the sides of your body as well as continuing to strengthen your core.From mountain pose, raise your arms over your head and lace your fingers, except your index finger and your thumb. Squeeze your arms toward your ears.
As you inhale, press your feet into the floor and engage your thighs before stretching up to the right. Then exhale and return to center.
From the center, repeat the same motion on the left side as you inhale. Then exhale and move back to the center.
If you have trouble raising your arms completely over your head, raise them as much as you can and do the lean. Make sure the movement comes from your core, not from your shoulders.

, From standing poses, move on to the chair pose to strengthen your leg muscles, particularly your thighs and calves. This pose also strengthens your core, lengthening your arms and torso.As you inhale, bring your arms up overhead until your biceps are next to your ears.
On exhale, lower your arms behind your body, bend your knees and lower your hips straight down. The work should come from your core and thighs, not your knees. You don't need to lower yourself very far.
Inhale and raise your arms overhead again. Your pinkies should be turned towards each other. Now you are in chair pose.
Exhale and return to the starting position. Typically you want to complete this pose at least 10 times, but follow the direction of your instructor.

, These two poses work hard to strengthen your back and core, as well as your arms and shoulders. At the same time, both poses have simple form and are easy to do even if you have poor flexibility.Get on all fours on your yoga mat, with your knees about as far apart as your hips and your hands a little more than shoulder-width apart.
Inhale and curl your toes into the mat and push down into your hands and toes. Pull your belly in as you exhale and lift your hips until your legs and arms are straight. This is downward-facing dog.
Spread your toes and lift your heels until you are resting on the balls of your feet. Hold the pose for five breaths, then slowly move back to your starting position.
From the downward-facing dog pose, if you pull your torso forward as you inhale you can move into plank pose. Your body should be a straight line from your heels to your shoulders.
As you exhale, raise your hips again to move back into downward-facing dog. Repeat this combination 5 to 10 times.

, When starting yoga practice, move into poses with an abundance of caution. Your pace should be focused and deliberate. Don't worry if you fall behind the rest of the class or are unable to move into the poses as quickly as others, or hold them as long.Pay attention to yourself rather than other people in your class and what they're doing.
Don't worry if you get behind. Maintain your own consistent pace rather than trying to rush through moves to catch up.
Especially if you're just starting out and you have poor flexibility, choose a beginner or gentle yoga class that has a slower pace.

, Breath is fundamental to yoga practice, and has nothing to do with your flexibility or range of mobility. As long as you are maintaining correct breathing, it doesn't matter how deeply you're able to go into the pose itself.Yoga poses and movements are all centered around your breath. Resist the temptation to hold your breath, and try to keep focus on inhaling and exhaling above all else.
When you inhale, breathe in through your nose, expanding your belly and chest and filling your lungs. As you exhale, press your belly in and breathe out forcefully through your mouth. Think of making a whispered ""ha"" as you exhale.
Keep in mind that proper breathing, just like anything else in yoga, takes practice to do correctly and well.
Use your breath as your mental marker. If you start thinking about something else, simply acknowledge the thought and return to your breath.

, Meditation also is crucial to yoga practice, and most classes begin and end with a brief period of meditation designed to clear your mind and relax your body. Meditation can reduce stress and enhance your yoga experience.Meditation in yoga often is done from the lotus position, with your legs intwined in front of you and your hands pressed together in front of the center of your chest.
If you have trouble getting into the lotus position, you typically can sit with one leg on top of the other, or with your legs extended in front of you. If the lotus position is uncomfortable or painful, sit in a different position.
The meditation itself is far more important than what position your body is in. Focus on your breath. Many yoga classes also use the chanting of mantras to help you focus and breathe properly.

, When you do yoga, you shouldn't be stiff or clinched. Rather, keep your body controlled but loose. Pay attention to your body and your breath and relax as you move into each pose.Particularly if you have poor flexibility or a limited range of motion, you may naturally tense up as you move your body. With practice, you'll be able to overcome this.
It's also reflexive to tense up if you feel yourself out of balance. Firm up your feet and hands and try to pull your weight up and into your core to find your balance again.
If you do feel your muscles tensing up, take a breath and move slowly into a lighter or more comfortable position. It's also okay to shake out your legs or arms if you feel them getting tight.

, Particularly if you have poor flexibility or limited range of motion, pay attention to how your body feels and when you're experiencing discomfort. Your yoga practice should be mentally and physically energizing and calming, not painful.It can help improve your focus to move through the poses with your eyes closed. Your instructor typically will tell your class members how to move, so you don't necessarily have to worry about watching your instructor.
If your instructor moves you or corrects your pose, recognize how it feels differently.
Focusing on your breath can help enforce the connection between your mind and your body.

, Maintaining your breath and doing poses with correct form is important to avoid strain and decrease your risk of injury. Don't push yourself too far or force your body into positions that cause you discomfort or pain.Especially if you're in a class with more flexible people, try not to pay attention to what they're doing. Yoga is not a competition.
You can get just as much out of the practice even if you aren't able to fully execute all of the poses as long as you keep your mind focused on your breath and your body.
Find a resting pose, such as child's pose, that is safe and comfortable to you. Move into that pose if you are unable to comfortably perform or need time to breathe and regain your focus.

, If you're having a hard time with a pose, pinpoint exactly what portion of the pose causes you trouble so your instructor can help you find a way to modify the pose to eliminate that discomfort.There are different modifications available for yoga poses, but until you figure out why a pose is difficult or uncomfortable, you won't know which modification will be beneficial for you.
For example, if your legs and core aren't strong enough to hold your body weight in plank pose, you can rise to your knees rather than the balls of your feet. However, if you have knee problems, this modification may hurt more than doing the original plank pose.

, Yoga bricks can help you maintain correct form if you don't yet have the flexibility or range of motion necessary to go deeply into the pose. Other props such as chairs and tables also can help you keep your balance.For example, if you are doing a forward bend and do not have the flexibility to reach all the way down and place your hands flat on the floor, you can use yoga bricks instead and rest your palms on that. This may give you enough height to be able to complete the pose.
If you have problems with balance, you can lean on a chair, table, or even the wall for support. This will enable you to complete the pose in a stable way.
Keep in mind that these props are not crutches. As you continue your practice, strive to improve your flexibility and get rid of the props. Just make sure you're progressing safely and not forcing yourself to move in ways that are difficult or painful.

, Folding or rolling a blanket or towel and placing it behind your joints will decrease the required range of motion while still enabling you to maintain the correct form of the pose.For example, in child's pose you are on your knees with your body pressed forward over your legs to the floor. This position requires an extreme degree of flexion that can cause pain if you have knee problems. Placing a blanket behind your knees can relieve some of this pain and make the pose more comfortable.
A rolled blanket or towel on the inside of your knees will support your knee joints when doing squatting poses, keeping the joint from closing completely.

;
, Slide it forward to the back of your right wrist. Angle your right shin under your torso and bring your right foot to the front of your left knee, behind your left hand.









The outside of your right shin should now rest on the floor. The further forward your right heel is, the deeper and more intense the pose will be.
Keep your right foot flexed to help protect your knee.
If you are a yoga beginner, bend your front knee as much as you need so it feels comfortable and not tight or tense. It’s important to protect your knee in this pose to prevent irritating the joint. As you continue to practice this pose, you will be able to bring your shin more parallel with the front edge of the mat., Straighten it and let the front of your thigh sit on the floor. Look behind you to make sure your left leg is extended straight behind you, not out to one side.









Make sure your back thigh is rotating inward. Press all five toes of your back foot onto the mat.

, Position your right heel so it is in front of your left hip.


Your body will want to avoid putting weight on your right hip, especially if it is tight. Try to maintain equal weight in both hips.

, Inhale and rise up on your fingertips. Try to elongate your spine. Lengthen your lower back by pressing your tailbone down and forward.








, Don’t worry about putting your head on the mat. Only lower to a point that is comfortable for your hips but also gives them a deep stretch. Focus on placing equal weight on both hips and keeping your spine long.









If your hips are flexible or open, stretch your arms forward and stack your hands on top of each other. Rest your head on your hands, laying your torso over your right thigh.

, Inhale and exhale deeply through your nose. Continue to maintain equal weight in both hips and extend your spine forward and down.

, Inhale as you carefully slide your left knee forward. Exhale and lift your right leg up and back into Downward Facing Dog Pose. Keep your right leg lifted to release any tension in your right hip for 1-2 breaths.








, Drop down on your knees to all-fours. Repeat the same pose with your left leg.









Make sure you position your left leg correctly and breath deeply with each movement.

, Pigeon Pose can cause emotional resistance for some people, especially if the hip area is tight. If your hips feel too tight or uncomfortable, take a deep breath and come out of the pose. Practice another sun salutation and then try the pose again. Go slowly and only as far as feels comfortable for your hips and your knee.








Don’t force your hips into the pose. Be patient and go slow. Over time, your flexibility will increase and your hips will respond to this opening.

, More seasoned yoga practitioners, or those with flexible hips, can deepen the pose into a backbend.








Inhale and rise up in Pigeon Pose on your right side. Bend your back (left) knee and reach your left arm back. Take hold of the outside of your left ankle. Flex your left foot and try to maintain equal weight in both hips.
If this feels good, reach your right arm back and hold onto the inside of your left ankle. Square your shoulders to the front of the room.
Hold this variation for 4-5 breaths. Continue to roll your shoulders back and lift your chest forward and up.
Slowly release the variation and place your hands on either side of your right leg. Repeat this variation on the opposite side.

, Lift your heels individually off the ground -- you should be able to freely move one leg.

, Lift your leg and straighten it back. The goal is for your leg to continue the diagonal line upward from your back, but don't worry if you're not flexible enough for this yet. Hold you leg up for one deep, controlled breath.








, Slowly bring your knee up towards the front of your body, bending it roughly 90-degrees as it passes your chest.








, This is the crucial move into pigeon. As your leg comes forward, work on fluidly bending it and placing it down in front of you. You should be resting on the outside of your right leg and the top of your left leg, which hasn't moved.









Focus on exhaling as you set this leg down, as it will make it easier to stretch into the pose.
The further forward you can get your knee, keeping it bent 90-degrees or more, the deeper the stretch.

, Your hands are probably out in front of you from downward dog. Using your fingertips to grip the mat, place them back near your hips, 6-8"" behind shoulder level or so.








, Slowly pick up your back foot, which should be resting on your toes. Uncurl them so that you can rest on the top of your foot.








, Once you've gotten yourself into pigeon pose from downward dog, the rest of the form is exactly the same. Focus on elongating your spine, lifting your chin and chest so that you feel tall and relaxed. With each exhale, try and bring your butt closer to the floor, deepening the stretch.

, When ready, fold forward so that your chest rests on your knee. Your forehead should be almost on the floor, or touching. Extend your arms completely out in front of them with your palms on the floor. Again, use each exhalation to pull deeper into pigeon pose.








, Inhale and rise up in Pigeon Pose on your right side. Bend your back (left) knee and reach your left arm back. Take hold of the outside of your left ankle. Flex your left foot and try to maintain equal weight in both hips. Continue to roll your shoulders back and lift your chest forward and up, keeping great form as you look to the ceiling.








, If you feel confident reaching back with your left hand to grab your left foot, reach your right arm back and hold onto the inside of your left ankle. Square your shoulders to the front of the room. Having both hands back requires core control, balance, and flexibility.









Hold this variation for 4-5 breaths, then ease your foot back to the ground.

Find a recording of someone reading aloud Yoga Nidra instructions.,
Prepare blankets, a soft mat, or other comfortable surface to sit or lie on.,
Prepare any comforts such as incense, a candle, a mister, etc.,
Wear loose clothing.,
Warm up with sun salutations, or Surya Namaskar.,
Make the room as quiet as possible.",How to Do Yoga Nidra1," To induce Yoga Nidra, you must listen to a set of instructions, similar to guided meditation. You can listen to a friend reading the instructions, but listening to a recording by someone else or by you yourself is more practical. A good recording will have a soft, soothing feel, while being clear. Many people prefer female recordings, but you can also find many male recordings, if that works for you. Some well-recorded videos are:

, For Yoga Nidra to be successful, you must be comfortable. If you have a memory foam mattress or mat, this is the best thing to use. If not, any pillows or mats will work. Some people prefer to elevate their feet, or head.

, You don’t want to be breathing toxic fumes, artificial fragrances, or any bad smells when practicing yoga. Scents can be geared specifically towards encouraging emotional reactions. Some foster tranquility, calming our nervous system; others promote a sense of joy and energy.

, You'll want clothing that is comfortable and breaths easily. This can help deter any unsuccessful attempts because you are not comfortable. You don't necessarily need specific yoga clothes, just loose and breathable clothes.

, Doing a few rounds of sun salutations, or Surya Namaskar, can effectively prepare your muscles and mind to practice yoga.If this does not relax you, try learning a few yoga asanas. There are a wide variety of yoga poses, or asanas, that one can practice and they range from difficult and strenuous to simple and relaxing.

, To fully concentrate the mind, it must be silent. However, in today's busy times, it may be impossible. Instead of focusing on making the room silent, focus on making the room quiet.

If you choose to lie down, extend your body as far as you can, flattening your body out. Position your head wherever it feels most comfortable.

, Relax your eyes, letting them simply lay on your eyeballs, not squeezing them shut.

, Breathe in through your nose, gradually filling your lungs with air, then exhale through your mouth. Try to inhale and exhale on a 10 second count.

, Focus only on that body part, not allowing your mind to become distracted by other things.

, You should now feel completely relaxed, all tension

Choose a stable chair.,
Sit at the front of your chair.,
Keep your feet flat on the floor.,
Roll your shoulders up and back.",How to Do Yoga in a Chair1," You don't necessarily need a special chair to do yoga in a chair, but the chair you use shouldn't be one that can move easily. Office chairs with wheels typically aren't going to provide the stability you need.The seat of the chair should be relatively flat, the legs even and stable. Chairs that spin generally won't work as well for twisting yoga poses. A folding chair or stationary four-legged chair such as a dining room chair probably will work best.
A padded chair is fine, but you generally don't want to use something too soft, as it might not provide you the stability you need.;
, Stability is important while doing chair yoga. Move to the front of the chair and adjust your hips so that you are resting on your sitting bones, not your tail bone.Your chest should be in line with your pelvis, your back neutral. Draw your tail bone in and sink into your sitting bones, taking care not to arch your lower back. If you need help or support to stay in this position, you might want to roll a blanket or towel and place the roll just behind you.
Your thighs should be flat against the chair. If your feet don't fully reach the floor, lower the chair (if possible) or use hardcover books or yoga blocks to rest your feet.
Your feet should be roughly hip-width apart, your thighs straight, knees in line with your ankles.

, When doing chair yoga, think in terms of right angles. Your back should be perpendicular to your thighs, your shins perpendicular to the floor. Press all four corners of your feet firmly into the floor.If you can't rest your feet flat on the floor from a seated position in the chair, try moving more forward in the chair. If your feet still don't reach the floor, choose a lower chair or use yoga blocks or other hard objects to rest your feet upon.
If you're resting your feet on two objects, such as books, make sure they are the same thickness and that they support your entire foot.

, Bring awareness to your shoulders not only when you're doing yoga in a chair, but throughout your day by moving your shoulders into alignment with your spine.Your shoulder blades should be lined up along your spine and tucked against your back. You will probably notice an immediate change of feeling in your neck and shoulders.
Particularly if you work in an office, you probably spend a good deal of time hunched over a computer. Take a moment periodically to check in with your shoulders and drop your shoulder blades if you find you're crunching your shoulders forward.

Turn your feet to different angles.,
Hold your arms parallel to the floor.,
Inhale and then bend your body to the right as you exhale.,
Place your right hand on your right shin, as far down as you can reach comfortably.,
Stretch as much as you can.,
Hold the position for several seconds while breathing in and out.,
Return to the original position on an inhale.,
Avoid triangle pose if you have certain medical conditions.,
Take a yoga class before attempting triangle pose on your own.,
Start off slow.",How to Do the Triangle Pose in Yoga," To start, assume the starting yoga position. Make sure to use a yoga mat. To do so, stand up straight on your mat. Keep your feet hip length apart and your arms at your side., From here, you'll want to spread your feet apart. Do so slowly to avoid tripping and falling. You want to strive for about 3.5 to 4 feet of distance between your feet., In triangle pose, your feet need to be bent at different angles so you can maneuver your body correctly. Your right foot and left foot should be pointed in slightly different directions.Turn your right foot away from your body, so your toes are pointing outward. Keep turning your right foot until it's at a 90 degree angle.
Now, move your left foot. You should turn your left foot slightly inward. Your back toes should form a roughly 45 degree angle pointing towards your body., Raise your arms outward on either side. Form a line with your arms, going from the fingertips on one arm to the fingertips on the other arm, that runs roughly parallel to the floor.Stretch your fingertips out to each side.
Make sure your palms are facing the floor.

, Now you can begin the actual exercise. To start, inhale. Then exhale and, as you do so, bend your body to the right. You want to keep bending until the line of your arms forms a roughly 90-degree angle with the floor.As you bend, make sure you bend your body from the hips. You want to keep your body facing forward as you bend.
Keep your waist as straight as possible while you bend, and keep your arms in a straight line.

, Try to touch your right hand to your right shin. If you can't do this, touch your ankle or the floor just outside your mat. Touch whatever place is comfortable for you and allows you to keep your balance., While touching your shin, ankle, or the floor, stretch as much as you can. Stretch your left arm towards the ceiling. Slowly turn your head to the left, gazing at your right thumb, as this helps stretch out the body.If stretching causes you to feel pain, stop stretching and just hold the pose as is. You do not want to strain yourself, and it may take awhile for you to be flexible enough to stretch during this pose.

, Now, hold the position while breathing in and out. How long you hold the position depends on how long you feel comfortable. You can hold it up to one minute, but you may hold it significantly less than that if you're starting out. When you begin to feel strained, stop holding the position., Once you've finished holding the position, raise your body up. Keep your arms in a straight line, but unbend your feet. Make sure you come up on an inhale rather than an exhale.Once you've done one side, repeat the same maneuver on the opposite side of your body.

, For most people, triangle pose is safe. However, certain health conditions can make triangle pose risky.You should not attempt triangle pose if you have low blood pressure, diarrhea, or headaches. You should turn your head downward instead of upward if you have high blood pressure.
If you have a neck injury, you should hold off on triangle pose until it heals.

, Everyone's body is different. Certain poses may be more or less safe for you depending on your personal abilities. Before attempting triangle pose, you should take a yoga course with the supervision of a professional trainer. A trainer can tell you whether or not triangle pose is safe for you., It can take awhile to get the body movements behind triangle pose right. Do not stretch or bend too much too soon. It may be awhile before you can hold the position for a full minute. You may be unable to do some aspects of triangle pose, such as bending your head or stretching your arm, until you've practiced for awhile. Be patient and give your body the time it needs to adjust.

Use the breath of fire to renew your energy.,
Stretch your chest with sun breath.,
Calm your nervous system with knee bend to cobra.,
Release neck tension with yoga exercises.,
Stretch and release your shoulders.",How to Do Yoga in a Chair2," The breath of fire is a rhythmic breathing exercise that you can do anywhere, either sitting or standing. If you're self-conscious, you may want to go somewhere where you have privacy.Sit or stand in a comfortable position and close your eyes. Take a few deep, cleansing breaths, then shorten and sharpen your breath, breathing deeply but rapidly. Each breath should be approximately the same length.
As you breathe, pump your navel in and out. It can help to also make a ""ha"" sound in the back of your throat as you're breathing. Do this exercise for about a minute, then follow with a few slower deep, cleansing breaths.

, The sun breath allows you to breathe more deeply by opening your chest. Sun breath can be helpful if you find yourself contracting protectively in response to anxiety or stress.Press your sitting bones into your chair and reach up from the crown of your head to lengthen your spine. Open your palms upward in front of you. As you inhale slowly, extend your arms out to your sides and lift them over your head, connecting your palms at the top of the circle.
As you exhale, lower your palms together behind your neck. Focus on lifting your elbows as high as you can toward the ceiling.
Bring your palms back over your head on an inhale, then separate your palms and lower your arms back to your side as you exhale. Do as many repetitions of this exercise as feels comfortable.

, This alternating stretch helps squeeze out tension in your core to deepen your exhale, easing tension and improving your focus and concentration.Press into the seat of the chair, reaching up through the crown of your head to lengthen your spine. On an exhale, round your back and tilt your pelvis backward as you lift your right knee toward your forehead, tucking your chin to your chest.
Lower your right leg back to the floor on an exhale and return to a stable seat. On your next exhale, repeat the movement with your left leg.
Do eight repetitions of this stretch, or four on each side.

, While not necessarily a yoga pose, these exercises are inspired by the practice of yoga. They can be done at any time during the day that you feel tension in your neck, such as if you've been hunched over a computer or cradling a phone between your shoulder and your ear.Simply place your hands palm-down at the crown of your head, fingers interlaced. Breathe deeply for several breath cycles, in through your nose and out through your mouth.
As you breathe, push the crown of your head up into your hands. At the same time, press down gently with your hands. Hold these opposing motions for a few breaths, then release for a few breaths, then repeat once.
Make sure when you do this that you are sitting straight with your feet flat on the ground, back neutral, shoulders rolled back.

, Particularly if you have an office job that requires you to sit at a desk for most of your day, take periodic breaks to stretch your shoulders. This prevents tension from building up in your neck and shoulders.Start by getting into a strong seat with your feet firmly on the floor and your back straight. Breathe deeply, and on an inhale lace the fingers of both hands together in front of you, arms extended. As you exhale, raise your hands overhead, palms facing the ceiling, and stretch your armpits. Keep your shoulders relaxed, your shoulder blades melting down your back.
Take your hands in the same position and extend them in front of you, tucking your tailbone under and rounding your back. Breathe deeply and stretch to open up space between your shoulder blades.
Lift your arms overhead and then exhale and drop them behind your back. You can either rest your knuckles on your sacrum or straighten your arms behind you as you lift your chest to lean slightly backward, stretching the front of your shoulders and your chest.
Finally, take your interlaced fingers first to one side then to the other, leaning your head in the same direction as your fingers. This stretches the tops of your shoulders.

Try high lunges to loosen your hip flexors.",How to Do Yoga in a Chair3," A vinyasa, or yoga flow, involves moving between two poses in time with your breath. The cat-cow vinyasa is a spinal stretch that normally is done on all fours, but you can also do a modification of this yoga flow while sitting in a chair.Keep your spine long, and rest your palms flat on the tops of your thighs or your knees. Focus on your breath, inhaling slowly and deeply through your nose and exhaling out your mouth.
As you inhale, arch your back, drawing your navel forward. Roll your shoulders down your back so that your chest is open and your shoulder blades are in line with your spine. You are in cow pose.
As you exhale, pull your tail bone forward and your chin towards your chest. Roll your shoulders forward and curve your spine outward so your back is round. You are in cat pose.
Return to cow pose on your next inhale. Continue this movement for 5 to 10 breath cycles.

, Seated spinal twists give a good stretch to your lower back, as well as invigorating and strengthening your core. These simple yoga exercises can be done at any time during the day if your back is feeling tight.Start by sitting tall and breathing deeply. On an exhale, twist to your right, grabbing the back of your chair with both hands. Take a few deep breaths in and out, and then exhale back to center.
Repeat the twist on your left side, holding it for a few deep breaths before exhaling back to center.

, This deep, twisted forward fold will lengthen your spine and help alleviate lower back pain. It also gives a good stretch to your sides and core. Take care to maintain deep breathing throughout, and only go as far as you comfortably can.Fold your upper body from your hips so that your chest is resting on your thighs (or as low as you can comfortably go). Make sure your back is flat and neutral, your shoulders rolled down and back, away from your ears.
Place the fingertips of your left hand on the floor just to the side of your left foot. On an inhale, twist to the right and reach your right arm up towards the ceiling. Your gaze should follow your right fingertips. Take care not to crunch your neck.
Hold the position for two or three breaths, then untwist on an exhale and repeat the pose with your right hand on the floor.
There are many variations of this pose. If you find your fingertips can't reach the floor, you can use a block or a book. If you want a deeper, more challenging twist, place your fingertips to the side of the opposite foot.
You also can do a vinyasa with this pose. Twist on each inhale and return to center with each exhale. Do 5 to 10 repetitions with a breath for each movement.

, Much like the shoulder stretches, this pose helps open the space between your shoulder blades. It also tones and strengthens the muscles in your upper back to improve your posture so you will be less prone to back pain.Hold your arms in front of you and wrap one under the other so that your palms are touching. If you're tight, you may not be able to reach your hand all the way around, but go as far as is comfortable.
On an exhale, lift your elbows to about shoulder height. Twist by moving your elbows from left to right, as though you are drawing a horizontal line in the air with them. Breathe slowly and deeply. Do this for 4 or 5 breaths, then release on an exhale and do it again with the other arm on top.

, If you've been sitting for a long time and your lower back is starting to feel tight or sore, you might want to try a seated figure four. Since this is a forward fold pose, make sure you've pushed your chair away from a desk or table.Move forward so that you're sitting on just the edge of your chair. Bend your right leg so that your right ankle is resting on your left knee.
On an exhale, hinge forward from your hips, focusing on stretching and elongating your spine. Keep your shoulders neutral with your shoulder blades tucked along your spine.
Breathe deeply for several breath cycles, then slowly rise on an inhale. Drop your right leg to the floor and repeat with your left leg bent over your right.

, If you've been sitting in a chair for awhile, your hip flexors may tighten up. This modification also works well if you have a condition, injury, or disability that prevents you from doing a high lunge while standing.Move to the right front corner of your chair and turn your whole body to face the right side of the room. Bend your right knee so that it's directly over your ankle and your shin is roughly perpendicular to the floor. You can rest your hands on your right thigh.
Slide your left leg back and extend it behind you, keeping your hips and torso squared toward the right side of the room. Your left leg should be straight with your left toes pointed to the right as you rest either your toes or the ball of your left foot on the floor.
Breathe deeply into the stretch for 10 breath cycles, then bring your left leg back in line with your right and switch sides.

Start in mountain pose.,
Move your feet below your hands.,
Bend your knees.,
Raise out of the squat.",How to Do the Temple Pose1," Whether you're doing the temple pose on its own or as part of a routine, mountain pose is the easiest place to start. When you stand in mountain pose, you may feel like you're just standing there, but the pose is a good starting or resting pose and can help you improve your posture.To get into mountain pose, stand with your heels slightly apart and your big toes touching. Open your feet, lifting and spreading your toes. You can rock back and forth or side to side to find your balance.
With your weight balanced evenly on both feet, firm up your thighs and lengthen your spine, dropping your tailbone toward the floor. Imagine a long line of energy running all the way up your body.
Broaden your chest and press your shoulder blades into your back, hanging your arms to your sides. Stay in the pose for about 30 seconds, breathing deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth.;
, When you're centered in mountain pose, extend your arms down and out to your sides. Slowly widen your stance until your feet are directly under your hands. If you're a beginner, you may want to keep your feet a little closer together so you feel more stable.Turn out your toes and plant your feet firmly into the ground. A yoga mat can help you grip the floor more firmly and evenly. #*Don't lean forward or sway. Keep your back straight and firm. You can rock up and down, or side to side, to get used to the balance and stabilize yourself in the pose. Take a couple of breaths.

, On an inhale, bring your palms together in front of your chest in the prayer position as you bend both knees into a squat position. Keep your back and shoulders neutral and breathe through the position.With every inhale, think of pulling your shoulders up towards your ears, then pushing them back down on every exhale.
Keep your back straight, your tailbone tucked in and pointed toward the floor. Your upper body should be a straight line from your hips, not pitched forward.
Firm up your thighs and glutes, using them to hold and center your body.

, For the final movement of the temple pose, straighten your knees and stand straight up as you inhale, separating your hands and spreading your arms over your head as though waving.As you exhale, lower into a squat again and bring your hands again in front of your chest in prayer position.
You can do several repetitions of this pose. Do one breath for each movement: inhale and stand, then exhale and squat.
Pull your feet in closer if your knees start to knock or buckle. If you are a beginner, you may have to start from that position. The work should be done by your glutes, quads, and hamstrings – not your knees.

"
"
Do side bends.,
Add a fan pose.,
Accommodate shoulder or knee injuries.",How to Do the Temple Pose2," While doing the regular temple pose, you can add a cycle of side bends that will give an additional stretch to your sides and core, as well as lengthening your spine and giving your glutes and quads a little extra workout.Keeping your spine straight and long, extend through the top of your head and lean to your right, placing your right forearm on your right thigh and reaching over your head and to the right with your left arm.
With your left arm extended over your head, elbow slightly bent, turn and face your left arm.
Hold for a full inhale and exhale, breathing into the pose and feeling the stretch in your sides. Then return to center and repeat the same motion on your left side.
Repeat the entire sequence ten times, or five times on each side.

, To incorporate the fan pose at the end of your temple pose, when you lower your hands you will clasp them behind your back rather than bringing them to the prayer position in front of your chest.Stand firmly with your legs straight, and rotate your feet so your feet and knees are facing forward rather than outward as they were.
On exhale, hinge forward at your hips into fan pose. Firm up your legs and pull backward with your arms to keep your balance stable. If you simply lean forward you may feel as though you're going to topple forward, but keep your back flat.
If you're comfortable and are flexible enough to do so, you can continue to bend all the way forward, folding your upper body toward and in between your legs. Otherwise just stay with a flat back.
As you inhale, return to stand, bend your knees, and go back into temple pose.

, Temple pose, along with many of these other poses and variations, may put stress on your joints, specifically your knees and shoulders. If you're recovering from a recent injury, don't move or open those joints beyond your current range of motion.If a shoulder injury prevents you from moving your arms in temple pose, simply keep your hands in prayer position in front of your chest.
You should only go as low into temple pose as you can comfortably go and keep your knees pointed outward in the same direction as your feet. Raise up slightly if your knees start to buckle or turn inward.
Remember that yoga is not supposed to be painful. If you start feeling strain, or are having difficulty maintaining the pose, raise up and return to mountain pose and rest.

On exhale through your mouth, imagine pushing the air out of your lungs, the air at the top leaving first and all the air slowly and deliberately leaving your lungs.
Allow a pause at the completion of an exhale before you start to slowly inhale again.

Get on your hands and knees.,
Raise into dolphin pose.,
Walk your feet backwards.,
Breathe through the position.",How to Do the Dolphin Plank Pose in Yoga2," The dolphin pose is a beginner-level inversion that allows you to get used to being upside-down from a relatively stable position. In addition to stretching and strengthening your arms and legs, the pose also calms your brain and relieves stress.








Since the dolphin plank pose is a modification of the dolphin pose, it may make sense to you to start in dolphin and move into the dolphin plank.
Begin dolphin pose on all fours, with your knees directly below your hips and your shoulders directly over your wrists.
Lower your forearms to the floor, firmly pressing your palms and forearms down into the floor. Keep your back and neck long and neutral.

, On exhale, curl your toes under your feet and raise your knees up from the floor. Focus on lifting up with your pelvis and hips, lengthening your back and legs.








Keep your heels lifted away from the floor slightly and your knees slightly bent. With each breath, think of pushing the floor away with your palms and forearms while you pull towards it with your heels and try to straighten your legs.
Open up your shoulders, widening them away from your spine and drawing them towards your tailbone.
Control your head, holding it actively with a straight neck between your arms rather than letting it hang or lean against the floor.
Stay in dolphin pose for 30 seconds to a minute before releasing to your knees, or moving straight into dolphin plank.

, To move into dolphin plank, slowly walk your feet backwards, keeping your palms and forearms firm on the floor. Stop when your elbows are directly under your shoulders and your body is parallel to the floor.








Firm up your shoulders and press through your heels to help lift yourself up as you engage the core.
Keep your palms and forearms pressed firmly into the floor, as though you are trying to push the floor away from you.
Your body should create a straight, diagonal line from your heels to your head, with your elbow at a right angle and your upper arms perpendicular to the floor.

, Hold the dolphin plank pose for 30 seconds to a minute, inhaling deeply through your nose and exhaling strongly through your mouth. Keep your buttocks and the back of your legs firm and engage your core.








When you're ready to come out of the pose, slowly lower your knees to the floor on exhale, keeping your back neutral. Take a couple of deep breaths before transitioning to your next pose.

Follow up with locust pose.,
Move into downward facing dog.,
Rest in child's pose.",How to Do the Dolphin Plank Pose in Yoga3," The locust pose is a ""baby backbend"" – a deceptively simple pose that can be quite challenging. This pose can be good to move into after dolphin plank pose, and can be added to a flow of poses with dolphin and dolphin plank.








Start locust pose by lying flat on your belly. You may want to put a folded blanket under your ribs and pelvis to provide some padding. Rest your arms along your sides with your palms up and turn your toes towards each other.
As you exhale, lift your upper torso, arms, legs, and head away from the floor, so that your body weight is resting on your belly and pelvis. Reach through your legs, firming up your buttocks and legs. Your arms should be parallel to the floor, stretching back through your fingertips.
Keep your gaze straight ahead, taking care not to crunch the back of your neck or jut out your chin. You can clasp your hands behind you above your lower back to deepen the stretch in your chest.
Hold the pose for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply, then exhale and release slowly back down to the floor.

, Since you start downward facing dog from your hands and knees, it's a good pose to do after the locust pose. You also can do downward facing dog directly after your dolphin plank pose.








Walk your hands forward slightly, so they're just in front of your shoulders. Press your palms firmly into the mat and spread your fingers.
Tuck your toes in, and on exhale lift your hips up and back into downward facing dog pose. Your body should take the form of an upside-down ""V"" with your toes and palms supporting your weight.
Bend your knees a little to lengthen your spine, and with each exhale try to straighten them a little more. Your back should be a straight line from your hips down to your head. Pull through your heels to straighten your legs.
Keep your shoulder blades pressed down and back along your spine. Your upper arms and shoulders should be rotated outward while your forearms pull inward to stabilize your upper body.

, Child's pose is a relaxing pose to add to the end of any yoga routine. The gentle pose increases flexibility in your hips and back while giving you a chance to relax in a completely stable position on the floor.








If you are on your hands and knees, lower your hips down as you raise your upper body until you are in a kneeling position. You may want to put a rolled towel or blanket behind your knees for comfort.
Keep your knees about hip's width apart, or wider if it makes you feel more comfortable. On exhale, hinge your upper body at the hips and stretch out over your thighs, lengthening your spine to fold over your legs until your belly rests between your thighs.
Bring your arms to rest alongside your body with your palms up behind you. Slowly release your shoulders and rest your forehead on the floor (or on a block, if it's more comfortable).
Since this is a resting pose, you can stay in it as long as you want, breathing deeply. When you decide to come out of the pose, lengthen your torso and lift from your tailbone to raise up on an inhale.

Drop to your knees.,
Support your head on a block.,
Try the side dolphin plank.",How to Do the Dolphin Plank Pose in Yoga4," If you are a beginner, dolphin plank pose may be too advanced for you. You may be unable to control your muscles, maintain your balance, and breathe deeply while in the pose.








Resting your knees on the floor rather than rising to your toes will give you more stability and support your core.
You also might consider dropping to your knees if you find it difficult to keep your back flat.

, If you have a weak neck, or are recovering from a recent neck injury, you might want to place a block between your forearms and rest your forehead on it to reduce the pressure on your neck.








Putting a block between your forearms also can help you keep your upper body in correct alignment, with your elbows straight below your shoulders and your forearms parallel.

, If you've mastered the dolphin plank pose and are looking for something a little more challenging, you might try the side variation, which requires you to balance on one arm and the side of one foot.








From dolphin plank, slowly shift your weight to one side. Roll over to the side so that your weight is evenly distributed between one forearm and the edge of one foot. Raise your other arm towards the ceiling, straight out from your shoulder.
Look towards your outstretched arm, pressing your forearm and the edge of your foot into the mat.
Breathe through the pose, holding it for 30 seconds to a minute before lowering.
Rest in dolphin plank for a minute, then shift your weight and repeat side dolphin plank on the other side.

Complete the asana or a vinyasa.",How to Do the Crow Pose (Yoga)2," Once you’ve mastered bakasana and are practicing yoga regularly, you can attempt to move from tripod headstand, which is called Sirsasana II into bakasana.








Sirsana II requires good balance and a strong and engaged core.Only try this transition if you have mastered bakasana and feel comfortable in tripod headstand.Remember that you should never jump into any yoga asana.

, From prasarita padottanasana, begin to lift your toes up off the floor. You can either bring your knees to your chest and then raise your legs up into tripod headstand, or, if you’re a stronger yogi, can lift your legs directly into sirsasana II.









If you choose to lift directly into tripod headstand from wide legged forward bend, be aware that this requires a great deal of balance and abdominal strength. Engaging your mula bandha can significantly help you master this variation., Although this is a much more difficult variation than simple crow pose, it’s much more fun to practice and flows elegantly when done properly. From sirsasana II, bring your knees to your triceps and gently push back into bakasana.








Just as in crow pose, make sure your knees are high up on your arms. They should be close to your armpits.Once your knees are in place, push up on your arms and shift your weight lightly back. This should put you in an optimal crow pose.It may take some practice to make the transition from tripod headstand to crow pose. Playing with it and practicing regularly will help you master this series of asanas.

, Once you’ve finished practicing sirsasana II to bakasana, you can either lower back to malasana, or garland pose, or cycle through a vinyasa. Only perform what asanas you can without losing proper form.

If necessary, you can widen your stance as much as is possible to prevent this from happening., Make sure you do not press your front ribs forward. Instead, make an effort to pull them down into your torso. Reaching through your little fingers, lift your arms. Hold the pose for 30-60 seconds., Exhale while lowering your torso to your right thigh. At the same time, sweep your hand back to the floor. Place both palms firmly on the floor. Gently step your right foot back, returning to downward facing dog. Take 2-3 deep breaths in downward facing dog.

, Once you’ve taken several deep breaths in downward facing dog, you can repeat the pose on the opposite side. Begin by stepping your left foot forward between your hands, and perform the pose in the same way as you did on the right side.

Look ahead and hold the position.",How to Do the Crocodile Pose in Yoga," Even though the Crocodile Pose is, in most variations, a basic maneuver, it does involve moving and stretching that may exacerbate certain medical conditions.


While this pose can be quite helpful for back and neck stiffness or soreness, you should consult with a medical professional if you have a back or neck injury.The Crocodile Pose is not recommended if you are pregnant, as it places much of your body weight upon your abdomen while it is pressed to the ground.;
, Whatever version of the pose you choose, you will be spending plenty of time flat on the floor. Choosing a spot that is supportive yet suitably comfortable will better enable you to establish and hold your positioning.You may want to invest in a good yoga mat, but any type of light padding, or just a blanket, can do the trick.
Choose a comfortably cool room to enhance relaxation and focus. Many people find airy conditions beneficial, especially with the breathing elements. Consider opening windows or going outside if conditions permit.

, This is the basic body positioning for every variation of the Crocodile Pose. For the most part, you want your body to be able to relax “into” the floor.Place your arms in front of you, with elbows at about shoulder width. Bend your elbows so that your palms meet, with all parts still touching the floor.
Stack your palms and rest your forehead on top, so that your head and face are very slightly elevated from the floor.

, For all the basic variants of the Crocodile Pose, your legs should remain loose an relaxed. Find the leg positioning that is most comfortable for you.


Spread your legs slightly so that your knees are about at shoulder width. Many versions of the pose recommend pointing your toes outward, while others favor having them point inward. In the end, your foot positioning is a personal choice based on what is most comfortable., If you have positioned yourself according to the directions provided in the previous section, you can congratulate yourself on achieving the most basic version of the Crocodile Pose. Lie on your stomach, relax your legs, place your forehead on your stacked hands, and breathe, and you’ve got it.In this pose, focus particularly on your breathing. Try inhaling deeply, holding for a count of five (if you can do so comfortably), and exhaling purposefully.
Keep the rest of your body relaxed, and focus on your breathing and holding the pose for five minutes or more.
This version may not provide the same stretching benefits as others, but can still be beneficial to your posture, lower back, and stress level.

, Lifting your head only slightly higher will increase the stretching of your neck, shoulder, and upper back muscles. Even still, this level of lift should still be comfortable and manageable for most beginners, depending upon medical conditions and fitness level.You can keep the same elbow and hand positioning as with the palm method, but simply overlap your hands a bit more and use your stacked wrists as a headrest.
To life slightly higher, rotate your forearms so that your palms are perpendicular to the floor, then stack your wrists. This positioning may not be advisable if you have wrist pain.

, As you advance in your comfort level with the Crocodile Pose, you can keep raising your head slightly higher, further increasing the stretching factor as you go. Do so incrementally and carefully, however, and stop if you experience pain.


To rest your head on your forearms, fold your arms in front of you and place each hand on the opposite elbow. Draw your elbows in to raise your forearms off the floor, then rest your forehead on your crossed forearms.To rest your head on your elbows, fold your arms and place each hand on the opposite shoulder (or shoulder blade, if you can reach it comfortably). This will create a cradle out of the inside of your elbow joints (with your outer elbows touching the floor), and you can rest your head there., If you have built up sufficient flexibility and strength in your neck muscles, you can remove any support on the forehead and hold your head off the floor on its own. This maneuver will lift the upper torso higher as well, adding to the stretching of the muscles in that area.Cross your arms with your forearms overlapping on the floor and elbows on the floor beneath your shoulders. Use this to prop up your upper torso, and let your head hang down.
Do not attempt this variation if you have a neck injury, or if it causes pain in that area.

, While this variation is also called a Makarasana or Crocodile Pose, and has a similar starting position, it is a quite different — and much more challenging — maneuver. It is not recommended for beginners, or for those with back or neck injuries.When done properly, this variation offers substantial stretching of the back, legs, buttocks, and backs of the arms and legs, along with the neck. Many adherents claim it can improve posture and reduce stress, among other benefits.

, Your hands and arms are part of the maneuver in this variation, not primarily a support structure.Your palms should on the floor next your hips or upper thighs, and your forehead should be on the floor. You can use a rolled up towel for comfort.

, Now is when this variation becomes much more challenging than the others described in this article. Don’t expect to master it right away.Take a deep breath, exhale, and raise your head, upper torso, and legs off the floor. Your palms should be providing only balance, while your body weight is supported by your lower ribs, abdomen, and pelvis.
When ready, slowly begin to raise your arms off the floor and stretch them slightly outward to your sides. Try to pin your shoulder blades together, as if there is a weight placed in between them.

, If you can hold this final position for thirty seconds, you are off to a great start. Ideally, after some more practice, you’ll be able to hold it for one minute.With your head still raised off the floor, slowly lift your gaze so that you are looking forward instead of down at the floor. Do not place excessive strain on your neck in order to do this, however. Keep looking mostly downward if necessary.
After you complete your hold of the position, slowly return to your starting position by reversing the elements of the maneuver. Lower your face downward; put your palms down; lower your legs to the floor; and slowly return your upper torso and head to the beginning position on the floor. Breathe, relax, and prepare for another hold, if you can.

Come to all fours on your mat.,
Check your alignment carefully.,
Move on to a balancing tabletop pose.,
Try reverse tabletop pose.",How to Do the Tabletop Twist Pose1," To do the tabletop pose, you'll need a yoga mat or something to cushion your joints. Because you'll be on your hands and knees, you may want a rolled towel or blanket to put behind your knees for support.Get into position with your wrists directly below your shoulders and your knees directly below your hips. Your knees should be about hip-width apart, maybe a little closer.
Look directly in front of you, rolling your shoulders back away from your ears rather than crunching them forward.;
, The positioning of your body in tabletop must be correct if you want to avoid discomfort or pain when you later add the spinal twist to do the tabletop twist pose. Pay attention to the alignment of your hips and shoulders.In tabletop position, your back is flat and neutral – like the top of a table. Your hips should be square, facing parallel to the floor, and your shoulder blades should be tucked down your back alongside your spine.
If you're accustomed to a deep arch in your lower back, it may feel as though you're arching outward, despite the fact that your back actually is flat.
Practice with a partner or in front of a mirror at first so you can make sure everything is in alignment. Then get used to how that feels so you won't need a visual check to correct your posture.

, The balancing tabletop pose will challenge your back and core strength while preparing you for the tabletop twist. You can use a folded blanket under your knees if you need to reduce pressure on the joints.From tabletop, lift your right leg up on an inhale so that it is extended behind you, toes pointed behind you. Exhale and maintain your bodyweight evenly on both hips.
On your next inhale, raise your left arm so it is parallel to the floor in front of you, fingers reaching forward. Use your core to help stabilize your weight so that you are not wobbling or leaning to either side.
Hold the pose for three to five breaths, then release on an exhale and repeat on the other side.

, Reverse tabletop pose is an intense chest opener that may require a little practice for you to be able to do. Go slow and avoid making any movements that cause pain or discomfort.Relax first and open your chest by lifting and rolling your shoulders while leaning back from a cross-legged position with your palms on the floor. Your fingers should be facing your body.
Place your feet flat on the floor in front of you about hip-width apart, knees bent. Place your hands behind your body, fingers facing toward you. As you inhale, press your shoulder blades together to open your chest.
As you exhale, lift your pelvis toward the floor so that your torso and the tops of your thighs form a flat, tabletop-like surface in the air. Your knees should be at right angles so that your thighs and torso are roughly parallel with the floor.
You can hold the pose for several breaths, or lower your pelvis on the next inhale and then repeat. #*If you find reverse tabletop difficult, try starting with the low lunge and high lunge poses to help prepare your muscles for reverse tabletop."

Wear comfortable clothes.,
Set up your space.,
Consider taking a class.",How to Do the Crescent Pose in Yoga2," Contraindication is a medical term that is used to describe physical conditions that make a particular pose in yoga inadvisable to people suffering from the condition. Crescent pose, also called High Lunge, should be avoided by people with heart problems or high blood pressure.If you suffer from any of these conditions, consult your doctor before attempting this pose.

, You will want to wear clothes that are comfortable and conducive to movement when you do the crescent pose in yoga. Do not wear clothing that will inhibit movement, or that is too tight. You will want to wear shorts or pants that allow you to view your feet, as you will be positioning them for the pose., You will want a quiet, comfortable, and possibly private space to practice yoga. Make sure this is a place that will be free from distractions, such as a room to which you can close the door. While you do not necessarily need a yoga mat for crescent pose, using one may provide you with traction and cushioning for your joints.

, While almost anyone can do the crescent pose in the comfort of their own home, you might find yourself wanting additional guidance or instruction. If this is the case, seek assistance from a yoga professional. You can find group classes or one-on-one instruction in your community or online.

Start in tabletop.,
Reach your left arm underneath your right.,
Rest your shoulder on the mat.,
Repeat the twist to the other side.,
Include a twist with balancing tabletop.",How to Do the Tabletop Twist Pose2," As the name suggests, to do the tabletop twist pose you need to start out in tabletop pose. Pay particular attention to your alignment, because if your alignment is off you won't be twisting correctly and may increase your risk of injury.Make sure your hips are square and parallel with the floor. Your knees should be directly under your hips and your wrists should be directly under your shoulders.
Check your shoulders, also, to make sure they aren't crunched. Your shoulders should be rolled back with your shoulder blades tucked in alongside your spine.

, On an exhale, twist from the waist to extend your left arm straight across the floor to your side. Check to make sure that your hips remain square and parallel to the floor., If you are able to come to the full completed pose, your left arm will be flat on the floor parallel to your knees, and your left shoulder will be resting on the floor. Maintain your weight distribution and take care not to lean on this shoulder or crunch your neck.You can stay in this position for 3 or 4 breaths, breathing deeply into the twist. Lean back gently to open the inside of your resting shoulder blade and feel a good stretch.

, Once you inhale back to center, take a few minutes to reconnect with your breath and alignment at center. On an exhale, do the same twisting motion on the other side.Remain in the twist for 3 or 4 breaths, breathing deeply. You also might think about how the twist feels differently on this side than it did on the other side, and whether it's easier or harder.

, You can further challenge your entire core as well as opening up your spine while twisting in a balancing tabletop. Instead of reaching your arm straight out in front of you, twist from the waist and reach under.The arm you are reaching should be diagonal, but will still be parallel to the floor. Focus on twisting your spine to keep the arm up.
Avoid moving your hips when twisting. You want to twist from the waist with your hips remaining flat and parallel to the floor.

Move into tabletop position.,
Loosen up your spine with cat/cow.,
Flow between downward facing dog and upward facing dog.,
Do your tabletop twist.,
Add in a balancing tabletop.,
End in child's pose.",How to Do the Tabletop Twist Pose3," A seated twist is a relaxing way to gently ease your spine into the twisting movement and warm up your abdomen for more challenging twists. You may want to use a block or folded blanket for support on this pose.Get into this pose by sitting on your mat with your legs extended in front of you. Lean onto your right side and bend your knees so your feet are on the floor outside your left hip. You also can reach your right foot over your left thigh so that it rests on your left hip. Use a block or blanket under your right hip if you need additional support to keep your hips even.
On an inhale, lift through your chest and twist your shoulders towards your right side. Tuck your left hand underneath your right thigh, hand flat on the floor. Twist from the waist – your hips should remain facing squarely forward. Bring your right hand to rest on the floor behind you.
Breathe into the twist, coming back to center on an exhale. Repeat the twist with the other side. You can do two or three of these on each side if you want, with a breath between movements.

, Since the tabletop twist is a variation of the tabletop position, you'll want to open your routine by getting into this basic position fairly early. Make sure your knees are hip's width apart, and your wrists are directly beneath your shoulders.Since tabletop is a great pose to use as a transition between other poses, you may find yourself moving through tabletop several times during your routine, depending on the poses you choose to include.

, The cat/cow stretch is one of the most basic yoga stretches to help activate your core and connect your movement to your breath. It also loosens up your back to prepare you for twists.While you can start this stretch in tabletop position, you might want to tuck your toes under if this causes too much pressure on the tops of your ankles.
As you inhale, lower your belly toward the floor, lifting your chest up. Focus on curving from the middle of your spine and engage your abdominals. Make sure your shoulders are rolled back so that your shoulder blades are tucked down your back, in line with your spine. This is the ""cow"" position.
As you exhale, curve your spine back up toward the ceiling, pulling your belly up as though you are reaching toward your spine with your naval. Curl your shoulders under and drop your gaze so that your chin is resting on your chest. This is the ""cat"" portion of the stretch.
As you inhale, lower your belly and raise your chest back up to return to ""cow."" Repeat this rotation for anywhere from 10 to 20 breath cycles.

, Moving from downward facing dog to upward facing dog gets your whole body working in tandem and provides an elongating stretch for your spine.From tabletop position, roll back onto your toes and lift your hips towards the ceiling until your arms are extended in front of you. Press your heels towards the floor as you lift your hips towards the ceiling, pulling pressure away from your wrists. This is downward facing dog.
To move into upward facing dog, roll over your toes and lower your hips to the ground, pressing forward so that your torso is upright and your arms are straight. Your wrists should be directly under your shoulders.
To flow between these two positions, transition between the two poses with a breath for each movement. Continue this flow for a minute or two, maintaining focus on your breath.

, After stretching your spine vertically with upward and downward facing dog, the twist may be even more beneficial for your spine. From tabletop position, simply twist one arm across the floor to the other side of the mat.Keep your hips square and parallel with the floor, twisting only at the waist. Twist only so far as you can comfortably – if you feel any pain, ease back.

, If you have a strong core and good balance, you can try a balancing table top, in which you extend one leg and the opposite arm out straight so they are parallel to the floor.You also can do a twist in balancing tabletop by extending your arm straight to the other side rather than straight ahead in front of you.

, Many yoga sessions end in child's pose, which is a relaxing and rejuvenating pose that allows you to reflect on your practice and focus your energy. Since this pose also helps restore healthy digestion, it flows well with the tabletop twist pose.If you are transitioning from tabletop, gently slide your feet together until your big toes are touching, keeping your knees apart.
Sit back on your heels on an exhale, allowing your upper body to flatten and extend forward. Breathe deeply.
You can leave your arms extended, or take your arms backward alongside your torso so that your palms are facing upward. Since this is a resting pose, you can stay in it several minutes if you're comfortable, maintaining focus on your breath.

If you have a headache, wait until it passes to perform mountain pose.
If you feel lightheaded or dizzy, avoid mountain pose.
Insomnia and low blood pressure can also make you disoriented, so it may be best to avoid mountain pose if you have these conditions.

, It's particularly difficult to do crescent moon pose if you have any recent injuries to the hips, back, or shoulders. If you have chronic pain or injury in these areas, you should also avoid crescent pose.Talk to your doctor if you're injured. Work with him or her about when you can return to yoga and which poses, if any, will be safe while your injuries heal.

, If you're new to yoga, it can take awhile to get comfortable with it. It's very important that you ease into yoga. Pay attention to your body. If you feel uncomfortable during a pose, you should take a break.Yoga is meant to stretch and soothe your body and not to strain it. If a pose is hurting you, do not push it.
An instructor can help you modify a pose so it's more comfortable for you. You may have to do a modified version of mountain or crescent moon pose until you're ready to do the full pose.

If you need additional padding for high-pressure poses, place it under where your shoulders will be when you lie down. Put on clothing that allows you to move freely. This is not an easy position to accomplish. You will want to be as comfortable as possible throughout the pose.


If you know you have problems reaching to touch your toes, you may want to position yourself near a wall. You can use the wall to position your legs above you later.;
, Straighten your back and legs. Keep your legs in front of you and unbent. Practice breathing slowly in and out. This prepares you for the stretch or first position. Get into a consistent and slow breathing rhythm.

, Keep your legs straight and unbent. Keep your back straight as well. Resist the urge to bend your back as you reach forward. You should feel tension throughout your back and into the back of your legs and calves. Bend your head to stretch your neck muscles as well.

, With each exhale allow your body to drop a little more. If you feel the tension is too much, stop. Your goal is to stretch your muscles--not pull them. When you have gone as far as you can, hold the position for 15 seconds.


If you cannot touch your toes, do not be discouraged. With time and repetition, your stretches will become more successful. The goal of this stretch is to prepare the muscles in your back and legs to move into the pose. You can accomplish the shoulder standing pose without being able to touch your toes.

, Once you are finished, relax back onto your back. Slowly straighten your neck. Your back and legs will be stretched. Move back slowly to avoid cramping. Lay on your back for a few moments before starting into the shoulder stand position. Continue your relaxed breathing rhythm.

, Keep your back and legs straight. Your arms should be palms-down by your side. Your hands and arms will keep you balanced as you position your body. You want to keep you back straight to avoid overextending your spine. If you feel your back is coming off the ground, straighten it back out.

, You should now be stretched similarly to how you started stretching to touch your toes except your legs are in the air this time and your arms still on the floor. Keep your back as straight as possible and on the floor for now. Your knees or shins should be above your body and straight. Your weight should be on your shoulders, back, and arms.

, If you feel any weight on your head or neck, adjust to free your neck from undue strain. Keep your back straight. Allow your legs to move closer to your head. Keep all your weight on your arms and shoulders. There should be no pressure on your neck to balance or hold your body in position. You don't have to raise your hips too high, just enough to get your arms to support them later. You can go higher if you can keep all your weight on your shoulders.


If you feel you cannot do this without putting pressure on your neck or head, stop. You are going beyond your limits. You will need to stretch more before attempting this position. You can cause serious spinal injury from this pose if not completed properly.Allow your legs to fold.If your legs are too tight you may want to allow your legs to fold to get your back off the floor sufficiently. It is more important to keep your back straight than to keep your legs straight. Protecting your spine from bending is more important than stretching your legs.
Use a chair to hold your legs straight. Another way to accomplish this is to position a chair above your head. When your legs extend above your head, let your toes rest on the chair. As you lift your hips off the floor, the chair will support the weight of your legs and help you keep them straight while you focus on keeping your back straight.

, Shift your weight to your shoulders as much as possible avoiding any pressure to your neck or head. Move your outstretched arms to touch each other on the floor. Then, keeping your elbows against the floor, rotate your arms and hand and use the palms of your hands to support your back's weight. Shift weight off your shoulders onto your hands. Your hands will support your back as you lift your legs up above you.

, There should be no pressure on your neck.All your weight should be on your shoulders. Slowly stretch or move your legs up above you. Your back should remain straight throughout the motion. Your legs should end perpendicular to the floor and straight. Hold the position for a few seconds at first and longer when you are comfortable with the pose.At this point you are doing the supported shoulder stand pose. To accomplish the more difficult unsupported shoulder stand pose you need to move your arms. Simply shift all your weight to your shoulders and place your arms beside your raised body. This is an advanced move and should only be attempted when you are highly proficient at the supported shoulder stand pose.

, Slowly relax your legs. Let them come back to their previous resting position. Remove your arms from your back. Let them lay palms-down in the starting position. shift your weight to them again as you move back.

, Slowly lower your back to the floor. Bring your legs back down to their starting position as well. You should now be lying on your back in the starting position. Continue your breathing rhythm as you relax from your pose.

, Move your hands slightly under them. Lower your hips back to the ground. Your hips should be on the floor and also on your hands. This is to help hold your hands in place and support your hips for the counter pose.

, Bend only at your hips as if you are sitting up. Adjust your arms so that your elbows are supporting the weight of your shoulders. Try to keep them under your hips as much as possible for support.


This is counter pose is called the fish pose. an alternative counter pose is the locust pose.Similar muscles will be stretched in both but the locust pose is more involved and less relaxing.

, You should be able to slowly relax your neck. This allows your head to slowly fall to and touch the floor. The top and back of the head should now be on the floor with now pressure on them. All the weight of your upper body should be on your elbows and forearms.


You should notice that this stretch is focused on the muscles in your abdomen, chest, and shoulders. This counter pose is intended to stretch the muscles used in the shoulder stand pose. This will reduce cramping.

, Slowly lift your head up. Then lift your upper body so that no pressure remains on your arms. Slowly lower your upper body to the floor. Your arms should be resting beside you rather than under your hips. This is a relaxed position. Continue breathing in your controlled rhythm until you decide you are finished with the exercise.

Come to tabletop position.,
Arch your back.,
Return to tabletop.,
Create a flow between cat and cow.",How to Do the Cat Pose in Yoga2," Both the cow pose and the cat pose are done on all fours, which makes them good poses to do together. Make sure your wrists are directly under your shoulders and your knees directly under your hips.Take a moment in tabletop position to connect with your breath. Inhale deeply through your nose and exhale deeply out your mouth. Take a pause between each breath.

, On an inhale, come into cow pose by dropping your belly towards the floor and lifting your pelvis and chest towards the ceiling. Make sure to keep your shoulders open and your tailbone tucked in.Lift your gaze so that you are looking forward, but take care not to crunch your neck – keep it long, reaching through the crown of your head toward the ceiling.

, If you are doing cow pose by itself, hold the stretch for 5 to 10 deep breath cycles. On each exhale, think of lowering your belly and deepening the arch in your back. On every inhale, lift your sitting bones and open your chest.On an exhale, lift your belly to come back to tabletop position. You can continue to another pose or lower back onto your heels to end the pose, as you did with the cat pose.

Drop into extended cobra.,
Flex your spine with a seated twist.,
Relax with a deep forward bend.,
Rest in child's pose.",How to Do the Cat Pose in Yoga3," Downward facing dog typically is one of the first yoga poses you'll learn.

On an exhale, lift your hips up toward the ceiling. Roll over onto your toes and straighten your arms to come into an inverted ""V"" shape.
Hold the pose for 5 to 10 deep breath cycles, pulling through your heels to lengthen your legs as you lift up from your wrists, creating a balance point at your hips. Then lower back down into tabletop position.

, Just as cat and cow poses stretch the spine in opposing ways, extended cobra is the opposite of downward facing dog, giving your spine a good counter-stretch.From downward facing dog, lower your hips towards the floor as you lift and open your chest. Make sure your shoulders are rolled back. Your shoulder blades should fall straight down alongside your spine.
Hold the pose for 5 to 10 deep breath cycles. With every inhale, focus on opening and expanding your chest to hold more air. As you exhale, sink your hips into the floor and arch your back.
You also can create a vinyasa with this pose and downward facing dog, moving between the two poses fluidly with a breath for each movement.

, The seated twist increases flexibility down your entire spine and massages your abdominal organs to improve your digestion. As the name implies, you'll start this pose from a seated position.Extend your legs in front of you, placing your hands at your sides. Sit up straight, shoulders back, and adjust your weight so that you are sitting firmly on your sitting bones, not on your tailbone. You may want to place a rolled towel behind you to support your lower back.

Look towards the right, drawing your chin towards your shoulder. Hold the twist for 5 to 10 breath cycles, trying to twist further with each exhale. Don't crank or force the twist. Then release and repeat the movement on the other side.

, The deep forward bend is a classic yoga pose to stretch your entire back, including your muscles and your spine. It also increases circulation to your back muscles and spine.Start in a seated position with your legs extended in front of you. Make sure your weight is evenly balanced on your sitting bones.
On an exhale, fold forward over your legs from your hips, extending your arms overhead and then out in front of you. Try to keep your back as long and flat as possible.
Relax your neck and fold as far forward as you can without pain or discomfort. If you can, you can rest your forehead on your shins. Hold the pose for 5 to 10 breath cycles, then return to an upright seated position.

, Many yoga practitioners end their sessions with child's pose, an easy and calming pose that also stretches your entire back. Typically it's best to move into child's pose from tabletop position.Keep your knees apart, but bring your feet together so that your big toes are just touching. On an exhale, lower your hips until you are sitting on your heels, extending your arms forward so that you fold over your thighs.
You can hold child's pose as long as you are comfortable, breathing slowly and deeply.

Learn what art therapy means.,
Evaluate the advantages of this approach.,
Decide if art therapy is right for you.,
Work with a trained art therapist.,
Locate an art therapist.",How to Do Art Therapy1," Before you begin to do art therapy, it’s helpful to understand what exactly this process entails. In psychology, art therapy is a type of psychotherapy, a counseling technique, and a rehabilitation program where people make art to improve their physical, mental, and emotional well-being.The central idea behind art therapy is that expressing one’s self through art can be used to help people reduce stress, cope with trauma, resolve problems, and better understand their feelings and behaviors.;
, As you prepare to do art therapy, it’s important to consider some of the potential advantages of this approach:On a basic level, art therapy can help reduce your stress level, elevate your mood, and improve your overall mental health. This approach often teaches you about yourself and makes you aware of things that you may not have consciously acknowledged.
People who are not comfortable talking about themselves or participating in more traditional forms of counseling and therapy can use art to express their feelings and emotions. This is one of the features of art therapy that make it especially successful with children who might not have the vocabulary to articulate how they are feeling or are shy and withdrawn.
Another benefit of art therapy is that it can be done alone or in a group setting. Similarly, you can participate in art therapy on your own, or work with a trained art therapist who will teach you how to participate in art therapy, guide you through self analysis, and make sure you derive the most benefit for your specific needs.

, While anyone can benefit and you don't need to be a skilled artist, psychologists have found that art therapy can be especially beneficial to the following groups of people: Children who may not have the vocabulary to articulate how they are feeling or what they are thinking.
People who are shy and withdrawn, or who are uncomfortable talking with a therapist or counselor.
Individuals who have autism, dementia, cognitive disabilities, and traumatic brain injuries.
Victims of abuse, as well as people dealing with mental illnesses such as post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders.

, While you can perform art therapy exercises on your own, working with a trained art therapist can be helpful, especially at first. They will teach you how to participate in art therapy, guide you through self analysis of your work, and make sure you engage in exercises and therapy that meets your specific needs.If you have been diagnosed or believe you may have a mental illness, you will likely derive more benefit from working with a trained professional who can treat your condition and help you feel better as soon as possible.
Trained art therapists often have a master’s or doctorate degree in psychology, counseling, or art education. More colleges and universities are also developing degree programs focused specifically on art therapy.

, Art therapy is practiced in hospitals, rehabilitation centers, schools, crisis centers, nursing homes, and private practices. If you would like to do art therapy and work with a trained art therapist, here are a few tips to help you locate one:


Look online at the American Art Therapy Association’s registry of credentialed art therapists. This registry is organized by state and city to make it easy to find a trained art therapist in your area.
If you have heard of an art therapist or mental health professional who uses art therapy, see if they have been credentialed by the Art Therapy Credentials Board, the main art therapy professional organization in the United States.Many therapists discuss their training and specialties on their websites or in online profiles. Review these to see if they mention experience with art therapy. You can also call the therapist’s office and ask if they employ this approach.

Try an eye charm.",How to Cure the Evil Eye," The negative energy of an envious person can cause physical symptoms that are not related to a disease, such as weakness, eye infections, upset stomach, fever and nausea. Also, it is likely that the affected person will have personal, family or professional problems without any apparent cause., This method is practiced in Eastern Europe. Simply drop a piece of charcoal into a pan of water. You can also use the head of a match that has burned. Sinking is a good sign, while floating means a person or child has been affected.Usually a parent or healer performs these rituals, if the sufferer is a child. If not, the sufferer can perform them.

, Another method is to drip hot wax into holy water. Watch how the wax reacts. If it splatters, it means you or the child you are testing for have the evil eye. The same is true if it sticks to the side. People in the Ukraine employ this method., With this method, the person diagnosing the condition drops oil into water. If it forms an eye, the child is thought to have the evil eye. Another way is to pour oil over a lock of the affected person's hair into a glass of water (preferably holy water). If the oil sinks, then the person has the evil eye. In turn, special prayers are said until the oil doesn't form an eye to cure it. The person dropping the oil is praying for the evil eye to leave the person. Some suggest there are special prayers for this process, which you can learn from a local healer., The easiest way to cure the evil eye, according to some, is to have the person who caused the evil eye touch the child. Since the evil eye is usually unintentional, the person should have no problem with simply touching the child. It doesn't matter wear the child is touched. On the hand or forehead should suffice.


This belief is most prominent in Hispanic cultures.
Evil eye is supposedly caused (sometimes) by a person complimenting a child without touching him or her.

, In Mexico and Latin countries, some parents use an egg. They pass the egg over the child's body, commonly a prayer is said along with this such as the Our Father, and then put the egg in bowl beneath the pillow. They leave it there during the night and check to see if the white is foggy in the morning. If it is, the child was affected by the evil eye. This method also cures the evil eye at the same time., Some say that making certain gestures with your hand can ward off or cure the evil eye. One gesture is the mano cornuto, which is just a fist with the index and pinkie extended (horned hand). Point your hand down when making this gesture. Another is the mano fico, where you stick your thumb in between your index finger and middle finger (fig hand) in a fist.Some Italians carry a little red horn (corna) around by wearing it or keeping it on a key chain. The horn is worn in place of making the horned hand sign., One method said to cure the evil eye is the use of a mirror to reflect back bad energy. This method is used in China. You simply hang the mirror in a front window or on the front door.Some people in India also use mirrors to cure or ward off evil eye. However, instead of placing it in the home, small mirrors are sewn into clothes or worn on the body., Folk healers often provide cures for the evil eye. If you don't feel confident in healing the evil yourself, you can try a healer, who will perform the rituals for you., Some suggest that putting a pink coral bracelet on your child will help protect against the evil eye. Others suggest having the child wear a buckeye has the same effect.

, In Jewish cultures, parents use a red string to fend off the evil eye. For instance, sometimes it's tied around a crib bar or the stroller handle., In some Hispanic cultures, babies wear an amulet made of black jet. Often, it's shaped as a small fist. You may see it with red and black beads on a gold chain., When someone gives your child a compliment, you can try spitting over your left shoulder three times and then touching wood (or knocking your own head) three times. This method is most often used in Russia., One Sicilian method of protection is to scatter salt on the floor inside the front door or outside the house. The salt (with innumerable grains) is supposed to confuse evil-casters.Another method Sicilians use is the urine method, where everyone in the house pees in a bucket. Then the urine is spilled in front of the house., Many cultures use eye charms to protect against evil eye. You can wear one on a necklace, for instance, or use one as a key chains. In Turkey, these little charms are made out of blue glass, but other cultures make them out of other materials."

Consider what happens in mitosis.,
Count the number of divisions.,
Make sure there is a complete set of chromosomes.",How to Differentiate Between Mitosis and Meiosis1," Without mitotic replication, your body would not be able to heal itself, or even grow. When mitosis happens, your DNA replicates itself. During mitosis, your cells divide and they also exhibit clear phases:First, the DNA condenses into chromosomes and the chromosomes align.
Then, the daughter chromosomes are pulled apart and they move to the cell poles (the edges of the cell).
Last, the cell splits in two separate cells.;
, In mitosis, the cells will only divide once. These post-division cells are called daughter cells. Most human cells divide by splitting into two new cells.Check the number of daughter cells. In mitosis, there should only be two.
The parent cell will be gone after mitosis has occurred.

, If the cell does not have a complete set of chromosomes, then it has not completed mitosis, or it has been damaged. Each healthy human somatic cell should have a complete set of chromosomes."

Research different types of cleanses.,
Determine which symptoms you’d like to address.,
Remain skeptical about weight loss.,
Opt for something simple and short.,
Check with your doctor.",How to Decide if You Should Try a Cleanse1," There are many types of cleanses. A “cleanse” can include anything from sinus cleansing (with a neti pot) to colon cleansing (with an enema). But most often, the term “cleanse” is used to describe a strict, restrictive eating plan that lasts anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.Some of the more popular genres of cleanse diets include:


The Master Cleanse – This involves drinking a “lemonade” mix, salt water, and laxative tea for 10+ days. There is no solid food in this cleanse.
Homemade Juice and Smoothie cleanses – Celebrity health gurus and internet bloggers alike provide myriad recipes and regimens for consuming only fresh squeezed juices and/or homemade smoothies for a period of a few days.
Prepackaged juice and other cleansing kits – There are numerous juice kits, vitamin kits, or powdered smoothie kits on the market. These kits make the cleanse process simple, but they are usually on the expensive side.
”Whole food” or “clean eating” cleanses – Once again, innumerable bloggers and nutritionists advocate for cleanse diets that involve following a variety of “whole food” meals plans for a period of days.;
, Although the jury is still out on the scientific benefits of doing a cleanse, there is general agreement that sticking to only whole foods or organic juice for a few days can help ease some specific symptoms.If you are feeling two or more of the following, a cleanse might be right for you.


Low energy/fatigue
Weight gain
Constipation
Foggy mind/inability to focus
Trouble sleeping
Unexplained headaches
Skin problems, such as acne or skin dullness

, Not all cleanses reduce your caloric intake. Some may include a high volume of foods that are nutritionally dense and high in fiber that make you feel full. There are also many cleanses that restrict your caloric intake, which can help you lose weight. As a result, you may regain the pounds that you shed once the cleanse is over. You will be most satisfied if you focus on the other benefits and forget about the scale for the duration of your cleanse.Other benefits include:


Better sleep
Clean skin
Less bloating
Regular bowel movements
More energy

, There are a wide variety of cleanse options—some very rigorous and some a little easier. Some are very long and some short. Especially if this cleanse will entail a huge change to your normal routine, and/or if you have never done a cleanse before, consider choosing a program shorter in length and more simple in regimen. This helps ensure that you will complete your goal and avoid binge eating pizza puffs on day 4.Consider doing a short, whole food cleanse, such as Dr. Oz’s “Two Day Wonder Cleanse.”If you’d prefer to do a liquid cleanse, consider doing a one-day juice cleanse. Jus by Julie makes a pre-packaged one-day juice cleanse.Almost Raw Vegan provides recipes for a “One-day Real Food Mini-Cleanse” where you drink smoothies during the day but eat a big green salad at night., As with any major changes to your diet or lifestyle, you should speak to your doctor prior to doing any kind of cleanse. Fasting, cleansing, or otherwise limiting your food intake in an effort to detox is a controversial practice. These diets are not scientifically proven, and can actually be dangerous to individuals with existing health conditions. Seek input from your doctor to help decide if you should try a cleanse.Explain what you’re thinking about doing.
You might say, “I am planning to do the Master Cleanse for 10 days. Have you heard of that diet?”
You might say, “This involves drinking only a lemonade mix, plus laxative tea and salt water.”
You might say, “What do you think about that diet? Do you think I am healthy enough to do that safety?”

Think about what kind of geopathic stress is affecting you.,
Use a dowsing wand.,
Use a compass.,
Watch the behavior of pets or other animals.",How to Deal With Geopathic Stress1," Start with specific questions about the type of stress you are under. Is there a stream flowing under your home? Or are there earth lines crossing to create an overpowering disturbance in your dining room? Try to be specific, as it may affect what solution you take.You may be dealing with not one but several sources of energy at once. The distortion caused by an underground stream, for example, might well cross and amplify the force of a geological fault or vortex.
Keep in mind, too, that energy patterns can be cyclical rather than constant. If your own energy and health fluctuate during the year, it may point to the disturbance – for example, a seasonal underground stream under your home.;
, Dowsing is thought to be a way to discover subterranean water, minerals, or other objects. The idea is to take a device like a wand, pendulum, or V-shaped rod and hold it in front of you. The wand points to the ground when you are standing over water or your desired object. While dowsing has no scientific basis,some people feel strongly that the attraction of the wand to the ground is a result of electromagnetic energy. Try dowsing yourself or bringing in a practitioner to help you discover the sources of your energy disturbance.


In order to dowse, you’ll need a wand or V-shaped rod. Even a simple stick works. Start by holding the wand level in front of you. Then, begin to slowly walk around the area in which you suspect there is a disturbance. The wand will be attracted to the ground when you pass over such an area.
You can also use a pendulum to dowse, or two separate wands that cross when you have located water or an object., Some people feel that compasses are also effective at locating electromagnetic disturbances. To use one, hold it in your hand and turn until the needle is pointing due north. Then, move the compass over the suspected disturbance point. The needle will alert you of any energy distortions by wavering back and forth.Since it is hard to hold a compass steady, this method is best for small areas like a bed, chair, or sofa.

, The nineteenth century German geomancer Baron Gustav von Pohl made a startling discovery: cats, dogs, insects, and other animals are naturally attracted to areas of earth resonance. One of the simplest indicators of a geopathic stress zone is to be found in the behavior of animals. Look for signs around you.Cats, for example, will sleep over such spots. If outdoors, look for bee, wasp, or ant nests over the spot.
Excessive amounts of slugs, snails, other insects, or parasites is also a good sign of disturbance. Moles, too, burrow along geopathic stress lines."

Start with a cow pose.,
Follow with a cat pose.,
Perform dolphin push-ups.",How to Do the Baby Crow Pose1," Before you do the baby crow pose, go through some warm up poses. This helps prepare your body for the more difficult pose. Start with a cow pose. Get on your hands and knees with your back flat. Your arms and legs should be perpendicular to the ground. Raise your head and look ahead.Inhale and tilt your head back. As you do this, raise your tailbone and push down your abdomen. You are creating a dip with middle section.;
, Cow poses are usually followed by cat poses, which is why sometimes they are merged together and called cat-cow poses. From cow pose, exhale and lower your chin to your chest. As you do this, raise your back towards the ceiling as you tuck your tailbone under.This is the opposite of cow pose with your middle arching upwards instead of down.
Go back and forth between cow and cat poses around four to five times.

, The dolphin pose is the downward dog position but on your forearms instead of your hands. Start on your hands and knees. Inhale and tuck your toes under, and then exhale to lift yourself onto your feet. Press the sitting bones towards the ceiling. To transition into dolphin pose, lower your elbows and forearms to the floor. Your forearms should rest parallel on the floor.To complete these push-ups, inhale, look ahead, and lift the heels. Exhale as you lower yourself and tap the chin to the floor.
Do this move five times.

Ask yourself about your work.,
Pick out a specific part of your project or piece of art.,
Redo that part of your project.,
Respond to the original piece.,
Keep your projects.",How to Do Art Therapy5," An important part of art therapy is thinking about your work and asking critical questions about the project you create. Here are a few recommended things to consider when analyzing your project:What feeling does the piece communicate to you?
Does the image seem happy, depressed, mad, etc.?
Does the piece express different feelings?
How are these feelings conveyed through specific colors, lines, or shapes?
Ask yourself what the image might say if it could speak?

, Select a certain aspect of your project you find appealing or that you don’t care for., Create a new piece inspired by that area or section you chose. Add more details, include different images, and change the colors. Then, you can re-analyze your work and ask yourself questions about the changes you made., Employing the same approach or exercise you originally used, try creating a new picture or project. Then, you can compare the two works and assess how they may convey different feelings., Don’t throw your work away or discard it. Instead, keep it in a place where you can take it out, look at it, and consider how your art and feelings change over time.


The process of regularly analyzing your art will teach you how to self-observe, which can be useful in identifying and managing certain behaviors. Old projects may take on new meanings the more you analyze them.

Consider how gametes are produced in meiosis.,
Watch for synapsis.,
Count the number of divisions in meiosis.,
Check the number of daughter cells.",How to Differentiate Between Mitosis and Meiosis2," Meiotic replication is responsible for an organism’s ability to reproduce. When an organism reproduces, it makes gametes. These cells do not have complete sets of DNA. They have half the number of chromosomes as cells produced in mitotic replication.For example, the meiotic sperm and egg cells each bring half a full set of chromosomes.
Pollen is a gamete. Like human gametes, it carries half the number of chromosomes as other plant cells.

, Synapsis describes the process that two chromosomal pairs use to share and exchange DNA. This process is a part of meiosis, but not a part of mitosis, so it should help you to distinguish the two processes.Synapsis is when two ends of chromosomes meet and share genetic information with each other. After the cells separate, the genetic information will be mingled in two of the four cells.

, In meiosis, the cell divides more than it does in mitosis. This is crucial to the production of gametes. Because gametes need to have half the number of chromosomes as normal cells, cells divide twice in meiotic reproduction. This means that each phase one might find in mitosis is found twice in meiosis:First, the DNA replicates, just like it does in mitosis.
Then, cell divides into two cells, which also looks the same as it does with mitosis.
Last, the two cells divide again. This third cell division is not present in mitosis, so it should help you to tell the difference between mitosis and meiosis.

, With meiotic cell division, there will be four, final daughter cells. This number is required to create cells that have half the number of chromosomes that the parent cells did. Without these chromosomes, the gametes would not be able to perform sexual reproduction."

Choose your cooking oil base.Marijuana is not water soluble.,
Grind your marijuana.,
Mix your oil and marijuana.,
Heat the mixture to dissolve the cannabis into the oil.How you heat your mixture will depend on what you are cooking in.,
Strain the oil.Do this while the oil is still hot for best results.,
Store your oil for later use.,
Substitute your cannabis cooking oil for a portion of your recipe's requirement.",How to Cook With Medical Marijuana1," It is fat soluble meaning you need cooking oils with high fat contents. Canola oil works well. You may also choose olive or coconut oil. However, olive and coconut oils have lower boiling points than canola oil. Choose your base depending on your application.


If your final dish's recipe calls for a particular type of oil, you may consider that or a reliable substitute as an appropriate oil base.;
, You want to start with dry marijuana. You may choose to stick with only the flowers. Some people will use all parts of the plant.Keep in mind that you will want to strain your oil later. Try not to grind your pot so finely that it will go through your strainer. A coffee grinder or food processor will work well. Just don't turn your marijuana into powder.

, The strength of your cannabis cooking oil will vary by your mixture. Pour your oil into a slow cooker, double boiler, or saucepan. Add your ground marijuana and stir. Make sure all your marijuana is covered in oil.


If you don't know what mixture will work, start with a mixture of two parts oil to one part marijuana by volume. For example, mix 2 cups of oil with 1 cup of ground marijuana or 100 millilitres of oil to 50 millilitres of marijuana.

, How much you are cooking will also impact your cooking method. The goal is to get your oil and pot mixture hot without scorching. Stir the mixture frequently. You can add a little water to the mix to avoid scorching.


If using a slow cooker, cook the mixture on low for at least 6 hours. You may extend that to three days for a better infusion.
If using a double boiler, cook on low for 6-8 hours. Eight hours will give you a better infusion. Stir occasionally and keep a close eye on your water level. Don't let your double boiler go dry.
If using a saucepan, cook on low for no less than 3 hours. Stir frequently to avoid scorching. This method will be most susceptible to scorching.

, You can strain the oil using a wire strainer to remove the larger pieces of marijuana. If you still have solids you want to get rid of, strain a second time through a coffee strainer. This will take a lot of time so be careful and patient. You may want to do small batches while you continue to simmer the mixture.


Alternately, you can do your straining through cheesecloth. Use multiple layers for more filtration. Put your cheesecloth over the top of a large mixing bowl. Secure the sides with a rubber band. Pour the mixture into the bowl. If you can get cheesecloth, this method is often preferred because you can filter more at a time than you can with a coffee strainer.
If you only have small coffee filters, try using a rubber band for protection. Find a tall glass and place the coffee strainer on top. Cup the top a little into the glass. Use a rubber band around the top of the glass and over the edges of the filter to hold the filter in place.
If you use a glass container to pour your hot oil into, heat your glass up first. Consider running your glass under warm water and then scalding hot water for a few minutes. This should keep the glass from shattering from the intense heat.

, When your oil has been strained, store your oil in a proper container with an airtight lid. Your oil will lose potency when exposed to oxygen. It will stay good for about two months.You can extend the shelf life longer by refrigerating it.

, Your cooking oil will likely be very potent. You probably do not want to substitute all of your cooking oil with marijuana infused oil. Try substituting only a small portion such as half fluid ounce or more until you know the strength of your oil.

Practice deep breathing.,
Relax for twelve minutes in the morning.,
Perform mindful mediation.,
Take a yoga class.,
Walk through the woods.,
Listen to music.,
Grow a green thumb.",How to Control Cortisol1," Stress forces you to breathe faster and shallower than normal. When you practice deep breathing techniques, you will be able to lower your stress and cortisol levels. Abdominal breathing exercises for twenty to thirty minutes every day will significantly reduce anxiety and stress levels. Deep breathing increases oxygen flow to the brain, which stimulates a state of calmness. Mastering your breathing techniques will connect your body and mind while stopping the stress response caused by the release of cortisol.Combine deep breathing and visualization to stop the devastating effects of cortisol. Imagine holes in your feet where hot air can enter your body. Take a deep breath and visualize hot air flowing in from the holes and then throughout your body. Relax your muscles as you exhale, pushing the hot air back down your body and out the holes. This exercise takes six seconds to complete and is known as the “quieting response.”
Harmonize the body, mind, and emotions through specific natural rhythms of breathing. Rhythmic breathing techniques help eliminate stress, fatigue, and anger.
Try lying on your back and then place one hand on your chest and the other on your stomach. As you relax your entire body with your eyes closed, breathe in slowly through your nose. The hand on your stomach should rise (not the one on your chest). Hold your deep breath for three seconds and then release it. Do this exercise until you feel completely relaxed.;
, Taking a shower, fixing breakfast and lunch, getting the kids ready for school, putting your work clothes on, and dealing with rush hour traffic are just some of the responsibilities that might be part of your morning. Relax twelve minutes after you wake up before you begin the range of activities that get you ready for the day.Studies have shown that cortisol, “the stress hormone,” can be lowered by taking approximately twelve minutes in the morning to relax. Cortisol is often released early in the morning and is responsible for maintaining homeostasis.
Instead of jumping right into the workday by checking email messages or turning the computer, prepare a cup of tea and sit in the sunlight outside until you clear your mind.

, Mediation has long been known for its ability to help reduce stress and quiet the mind, but now mediation has been discovered to have a biochemical benefit: it can change brain chemistry to reduce cortisol levels, increase serotonin, and release endorphins.Mediation produces alpha (focused alertness) and theta (relaxed) brain waves.
All forms of mediation activate a relaxation response, which puts your body at ease and reduces the impact of cortisol on your body.
New research makes clear connections between mindful mediation and a lowering of stress, anxiety, and fatigue.

, Yoga helps clear your mind and reduce your stress levels. Research shows that practicing yoga, even for the first time, will normalize cortisol levels, bringing balance to the body. Yoga reduces muscle tension and thereby neutralizing the stress response. The exercises performed during yoga opens your mind to experiencing the thoughts, feelings, and emotions of your true nature.Relax your facial muscles and breathe deeply and slowly through your nose to reduce stress and anxiety. Be aware of your surroundings while keeping your eyes shut and remaining in the moment.
The combination of exercise and mediation produce healing hormones that have proven to effectively reduce cortisone levels and improve the ability to heal.
Or, you can get a massage instead. A nurturing massage is the ultimate muscle relaxation response activator that aids in other self-healing processes.
Yoga classes can be purchased on dvd or on the internet if you don’t have time to attend a session at a local studio.

, Relax both your mind and body by taking a walk through the woods or a local park. Nothing brings peace to the mind like walking through the forest with birds chirping in the background, leaves falling to the ground, and the rustle of squirrels and chipmunks running up trees. Nature brings stillness and immediate silence from the hubbub of modern society.If you are going to enjoy nature and relax your body from all the noise pollution, then, leave the cell phone, iPod, or tablet at home. Don’ let modern technology disrupt the peace and quiet.
Or, if you live in the city, snuggle with a pet. Playing with pets fills us with oxytocin, endorphins, and many other healing hormones. Let Fido cut your cortisol levels while your body heals itself.

, Listening to music prior to a stressor positively affects the psycho biological nervous system with a faster recover from stress. Listening and playing music increases the body’s production of the antibody immunoglobulin A – the cells that attack viruses and help to boost the effectiveness of the immune system, as well as lowering cortisol.Making, playing, listening to music, or creative expression, promotes the release of endorphins and other positive neurotransmitters.
Music can help reduce depression, anxiety, improves your autoimmune system, relieves physical pain while lowering your heart rate, decreasing your blood pressure, and slows down your breathing.
Vibrations from the sound of music also have a cathartic effect on the body.

, Besides the satisfaction of growing healthy food, gardening is considered an exercise that will help lower cortisol levels. Studies show that during the “recovery period” after gardening significant decreases in cortisol were detected, reducing acute stress.Reduction in stress, the release of aggression, and the reduction of weight were all results from the physical exertion of gardening.
Known as “horticultural therapy,” gardening’s physical activity, awareness of natural surroundings, and cognitive stimulation and the satisfaction of a job well done has had an important impact on both physical and mental health because of its ability to reduce cortisol.

Make sure you are healthy.,
Avoid periods of high stress.,
Avoid intense activity.,
Bypass the cleanse if you have a history of eating disorders.",How to Decide if You Should Try a Cleanse2," You should never decide to do a cleanse if you are sick. Detoxing and/or fasting can exacerbate illnesses and slow down healing. If you are under the weather, injured, or battling a more serious medical concern, take this time to recover and consider a cleanse at a later time.You may be wanting to address symptoms like difficulty sleeping, headaches, or constipation.
Consider whether or not these symptoms could be due to some kind of illness or condition.
Always check with your doctor before doing a cleanse.

, Drastically altering your lifestyle—even for just a few days—can be stressful and tiring in and of itself. As such, avoid trying to do a cleanse when you are under stress for other reasons. In order to be successful with your cleanse regimen, select a time when you don’t have a lot on your plate.You’ll be most successful with the cleanse if you are not busy while doing it.
Try doing this over a weekend, or during a break from work or school.
Additionally, think about any social obligations you may have. You’ll have more success if you can avoid going to parties and other gatherings.
For example, over the holidays is not a great time to try for a cleanse.

, Although moderate activity can be perfectly fine during a cleanse, high-intensity exercise should be avoided. If you are an athlete, do not plan to cleanse during periods of intense training.All cleanses involve some level of calorie restriction.
Exercising on a drastically reduced calorie regimen can weaken your muscles and lead to injury.
If you are doing a very restrictive liquid fast, you may feel very tired and may avoid activity altogether.

, At it’s core, cleansing means restrictive eating. As such, cleansing should only be undertaken if you feel confident about your relationship with food.This can trigger negative past relationships with food, such as food avoidance, binge/purge cycles, overeating, and others.
If you have a history of disordered eating, cleansing is not recommended.

Abstain from alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs.,
Stay away from processed food.,
Drink a lot of lemon-infused water.,
Try a whole food cleanse.,
Consider a liquid cleanse.",How to Decide if You Should Try a Cleanse3," Every cleanse out there is going to start by suggesting you abstain from toxic substances. If you are eating nothing but raw fruits and vegetables, but still drinking vodka and smoking cigarettes you’re not really doing yourself a service. Begin by eliminating alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. You may even find that taking a break from just these substances is all the cleansing you need!, After drugs and alcohol, the next thing you need to give up for just about any cleanse is processed food. This involves pretty much anything that comes is a package! This means staying away from sugar (donuts, cookies, , foods made from processed flour (white bread, crackers, pasta), and foods that contain chemicals, additives, and preservatives (candy, soda, chips).Elminating processed, “junk food” from your diet, even for a few days can be a big boost to your health.
Some nutritionists believe this is the real reason behind cleanses make people feel better.

, Sipping on warm water with lemon throughout the day is one of the best way to help your body filter out toxins. This simple cleanse supports your body’s natural detoxification processes without being restrictive or harsh.

On a regular basis, you should drink about 9 cups (2.2 liters) of water or other hydrating liquids a day if you’re a woman and 13 cups (3 liters) if you’re a man., Often we associate the concept of “cleansing” with not eating. However, whole food cleanses are the safest form of detox. In general, these diets involve consuming nothing but whole, organic food for a period of 1-12 days. Many whole food cleanses eliminate foods known to be allergens and irritants (such as wheat, dairy, soy, corn, white potatoes, peanuts, shellfish, caffeine, and refined sugar). Some whole food cleanses include only plant-based (vegan) ingredients, and some allow only completely raw plant-based ingredients (known as raw food cleanses).Dr. Oz’s “Two Day Wonder Cleanse” is an example of a whole food cleanse. Penni Shelton advocates for a Raw Food Cleanse.The Beachbody “3-Day refresh” involves smoothies as well as whole fruits and veggies., A more intense way to cleanse is to do a completely liquid diet. This could be a juice cleanse (nothing but pure fruit and vegetable juice), a smoothie cleanse (blended drinks that include whole produce, and in some cases blended grains or protein), or an intense fast (like the master cleanse, where you drink only lemon water). Liquid fasts are a bit riskier. Sticking to a rigid liquid fast can definitely help you lose weight, but you are likely to put that weight back on when you finish.Companies like Blueprint Cleanse and Life Juice Shop offer pre-packaged juice cleanses that you can purchase online.Dr. Oz’s 3-day Detox is a smoothie and juice cleanse.The Master Cleanse involves drinking a lemonade mixture made from filtered water, organic lemons, grade B maple syrup, and cayenne pepper. You also drink salt water every morning and laxative tea every night."

Rearrange your living space.,
Use Feng Shui to enhance your rearranging.,
Set up metal rods.,
Create a cork barrier.,
Invest in a new-age crystal.,
Get rid of other sources of electromagnetic pollution.",How to Deal With Geopathic Stress2," You may be unknowingly exposing yourself to geopathic stress. There may be a disturbance underneath your bed, your dining room table, your bathtub, or your your favorite chair. If you have identified a potential trouble spot, rearrange your furniture to avoid spending too much time over or near the point.


It may be that the disturbance covers a large area. If you can’t re-position your bed or other furniture away from the stress lines, you will have to consider other options, like tools to neutralize the disturbance or to enhance your own energy field.

, The traditional Chinese art of Feng Shui studies the interaction of humans with their environment. Taken further, Feng Shui can allow you to influence these interacting energies to improve your life. Find out more about its principles and apply them to your living space.


While the idea lacks a basis in science,some people think that Feng Shui can specifically address geopathic stress. This is because they see the Earth’s resonance as the unifying force between Heaven’s chi (virtual) and Earth’s chi (actual). The Schumann Resonance, they think, allows feng shui remedies to work better.

, A popular and simple method is to place metal rods at strategic points in your home or anywhere you suspect a geopathic disturbance in order to block or neutralize the distorted flow of energy. These points should be verified by dowsing. To make the method work, you’ll also have to know the flow of the earth lines.The rods can be copper, brass, or steel. Some people also feel that they can use other objects to redirect the flow of the Earth’s energy, and resolve disturbances. Called “earth acupuncture,” this method involves placing things like leaves, crystals, flowers, or shells at strategic points., Some people think that oak trees mysteriously developed a natural resistance to geopathic stress. In particular, the bark of the cork oak is believed to be effective as a barrier. Try placing cork tiles under your affected bed, for example, to absorb the geopathic chaos.You should be able to do this on your own.


Be aware that a cork barrier is not a permanent solution. You have only made a barrier. The basic energy disturbance is still there and will have to be resolved.

, Buy a new crystal to shield yourself. Some people feel strongly about the healing and protective qualities of crystals, which they say protect you from geopathic stresses but also, through energy resonances in your own body and negative ions, can stimulate your immune system and change toxic energies into beneficial ones.Quartz or shungite crystals work great. Amethyst, zeolite, and tourmaline are great at generating negative ions from moisture in the air. Make sure to wear your crystal at all times.

, The world is filled with sources of electromagnetic pollution that can magnify geopathic stress. High tension power lines, satellite towers, electric poles, or circuit breakers all send out high and low frequency energy that may increase geopathic stress, as can everyday items like microwaves, cell phones, and wireless routers. Minimize your exposure to such devices.For instance, get rid of unneeded appliances. If you can’t, keep them unplugged when not in use.

Get in a low squat.,
Place your palms on the floor.,
Move your knees around your arms.,
Lean your weight forward.,
Lift your feet off the floor slowly.,
Hold for five breaths.,
Release back to the ground.",How to Do the Baby Crow Pose2," To begin baby crow pose, you should come into a low squat, also called malasana. To get into this pose, lower yourself down into a squat and continue below parallel until your knees are bent. Your weight should be back in your heels so you can balance in this pose. Your body should be upright with your head and chest lifted. Bring your hands together palm to palm in front of your chest.Your knees should be wide. You will be on the balls of your feet.

, From the low squat, you will lean forward to place your palms flat on the floor. Make sure they are around shoulder width apart or a bit wider. Align the forearms so that they are parallel on the floor. Spread your fingers against the mat., As you lean your weight forward, wrap your knees around your upper arms. Squeeze your knees just above your elbows, making sure to keep your knees bent., Look slightly ahead, just past your fingertips. Transition into the pose by leaning your weight forward. Keep your knees close to your upper arms like they are hugging you. Continuing leaning your weight forward as your body moves towards the mat.You should be coming up onto your toes.
Keep your elbows on the mat the entire time. You should feel like your biceps and forearms are folding together.

, As you lean down, you will need to transition from your toes and lift your feet off the ground. Lift one foot off the floor first. If you are new to baby crow pose, lower that leg then lift the other leg. This helps you practice your balance.Once you feel comfortable having one leg off the ground, round your back and squeeze your knees and lift both feet from the mat. You should move your heels towards your glutes.
Point your toes.

, One you have balanced yourself on your forearms with both feet off the floor, try to hold the pose for five full breaths. If you can’t hold it for five, try to hold it for as many breaths as you can and work up to five full breaths.Look ahead slightly to reduce neck strain. You shouldn’t feel any strain in your neck.

Heat a pan of butter.Use low heat to melt one stick of salted butter.,
Grind your marijuana.,
Simmer the mixture.Add your quarter ounce or more of finely ground cannabis to your melted butter.,
Strain the butter and refrigerate.Choose a storage container for your butter.,
Substitute your marijuana infused butter for regular butter.Unlike with oils, most recipes use small amounts of butter for flavor.",How to Cook With Medical Marijuana2," Use a saucepan with a lid so it can be allowed to simmer later. Move your butter around while it melts to avoid burning. You can increase the amount of butter you make by adding more sticks and ground marijuana in proper proportions.


Alternately you can use a slow cooker to cook your butter and marijuana. With this method, cook for 8-24 hours stirring occasionally.

, For each stick of butter you will need at least a quarter of an ounce of ground pot. Remove the seeds, leaves, and stems and focus on the flower buds. Grind the dried flower bud in a coffee grinder or food processor. Finer grinding may be done with a mortar and pestle.


If you are a medical patient you may want to double your dose to ensure the better results with less butter., Keep the temperature at low. Stir the ground pot into your butter until it is evenly distributed. If your butter starts getting too hot, add a little water to reduce the temperature.

, Cover the top with cheeseclothfor straining. Use a rubber band around the top of the container to hold the cheesecloth in place. Pour the mixture through the cheesecloth into the container. Squeeze the solids to get as much butter out as possible. Store in an airtight container in your fridge for later use.


You may also use a wire mesh strainer.If you used less finely ground marijuana, the wire mesh will catch the large solid pieces. Squeeze the solids by pushing on them with a metal spoon to get excess butter from them.

, You can substitute the entire recipe amount with marijuana butter. If you find that you are not getting the needed medicinal effect, consider increasing the amount of marijuana per stick of butter to a half an ounce. Alternately, you can use a different method of cooking with marijuana.

Remove all stems and seeds from the marijuana buds.The buds and flowers have the highest concentrations of cannabinoids are located in the buds.,
Grind the flowers.Use a food processor with sharp blades or a coffee grinder.,
Sift through the ground flowers for unground parts.,
Regrind the unground parts.,
Store your marijuana flour in an airtight container.The marijuana's potency will be degraded by oxidation if not stored properly.,
Substitute your marijuana flour for a portion of your recipe's requirement.",How to Cook With Medical Marijuana3," Remove any stems or seeds and allow the buds to dry thoroughly. You will need them as dry as possible to form powder. Even a small amount of moisture can be the difference between powder and paste.

, The goal is to make a fine powder almost like flour itself. Keep blending and grinding until you see almost everything is pulverized. It may take some time.

, You may find that you still have some unground parts. Use a wire strainer or flower sifter over a bowl to separate the ground and unground parts. You should have only a little bit, if much at all, unground. Set aside the bowl of marijuana flour for now.

, The unground parts left in your strainer need to be reprocessed. If you have a coffee grinder, send them through a second time. If you are not getting the result you hoped for or if you started with a food processor, move the unground parts to a mortar and pestle. Apply pressure with the mortar and ""stir"" the unground parts to produce the necessary grinding action.


You may find that this produces the most fine texture for your flour. If you are not satisfied with the output of your food processor or coffee grinder, try the mortar and pestle. Keep in mind that this will require a lot of elbow grease. However, if you pre-grind using a coffee grinder or food processor then this should be easier.

, Use an airtight container. Vacuum sealing will work great as well. Try to use it the same day or within 24 hours. Store in a freezer for long term storage., Generally you are looking at about a 10% substitution but as much as 20% may be ok.This is especially true for baked good that must rise such as breads. Unlike using infused butter or oil, marijuana flour is a true substitution. Marijuana flour doesn't act quite the same as regular flour.


An alternate method of storage involves pre-mixing your flour with regular baking flour. Store your mixture in an airtight container though. Just because it is mixed with regular flour does not mean it is protected from oxidation. Consider storing only pre-measured portions in vacuum sealed bags in a freezer for optimal usage.

Other “stress-formula” multivitamins that contain vitamins B-1, B-5, and B-6 were able to bring cortisol ranges back to their normal levels.
Minerals such as magnesium greatly reduce cortisol levels following extensive exercise while zinc shows a dramatic fall in plasma cortisol levels, also after exercising.
In addition to reducing stress and controlling cortisol, these supplements also boost the immune system.

Rather, eat small meals that are balanced in protein, complex carbohydrates, and good fats like olive oil and flaxseed oil. This will keep cortisol levels low.Glucagon is released overnight while you are sleeping and between meals. It is important to control glucagon in order to regulate the body’s blood sugar and fuel balance. If unbalanced, then cortisol will be produced to increase blood sugar levels.

How long was the training?
How long has the person been practicing acupuncture?
Does the acupuncturist have experience treating my specific condition?
Is the acupuncturist licensed?

This can be especially helpful if the person got acupuncture for reasons similar to your own. Ask your doctor or other healthcare professional if they have any recommendations for potential acupuncturists to visit.Give the person or your doctor a general idea of why you want to visit the acupuncturist.

This can give you a wide array of choices should one person not work out or fail to possess the traits you want. You can put together a list of potential acupuncturists by adding referrals and practitioners you find online or in places like the phone books or local businesses.

You can even locate a couple of potential acupuncturists within one practice.

This benefits not only the acupuncturist, but also the patient., Now that you have found a few potential acupuncturists, take a minute to consider the details of their offices. You can also call if details are not listed on a website or other advertising. There are many factors to consider such as price, whether the office accepts health insurance, the office location, and available parking facilities.Find out the following information when making your decision on a specific acupuncturist’s practice:


Price, such as for initial treatments and follow up visits, which can run anywhere from $70 to $125 per sessionForms of payment accepted and when it is expected
What type of health insurance the office accepts or if it will give you a receipt to submit to your insurance
Parking situation
Exact location
Office hours
Accessibility
Services offered beyond acupuncture, Your acupuncturist appointment, like a traditional medical doctor appointment, is often a very personal experience. Making sure you’re comfortable with the practitioner and office before you go may help reduce the risk of a bad experience. You can get a good sense of these factors through compiling your own list, but may find that reading reviews about the practitioner and their office can help you make your final decision.Use online services such as Angie’s List to find reviews about local acupuncturists and the experiences others have had with a specific practitioner.You can also look for acupuncturists in your local accredited by the Better Business Bureau at http://www.bbb.org/louisville/accredited-business-directory/acupuncturists/


, Once you’ve had a chance to compile a list of potential acupuncturists, select the practitioner who most closely meets your needs and wishes. Call their office and schedule an appointment. If the acupuncturist isn’t accepting new patients, or even if you get a bad feeling when you call, move to the next person on your list.

, Get to the office at least 15 minutes early, but ideally 30 minutes before your scheduled appointment. This will give you a chance to fill out any paperwork, ask administrative questions, and check out the office.


Check in with the receptionist and let them know your name and why you’re at the office. Ask any questions you may have about things like insurance or parking.

, Acupuncturists must legally follow the same standards of hygiene as any medical doctor’s office. This includes single use needles, no blood or vomit on surfaces, and clean hands. Ask the receptionist for a tour of the office or where the restroom is. Either of these options can give a sense of the office’s cleanliness.Look for some of the following hallmarks of a clean practice:


Single use needles
No needles strewn about, but in separate biohazard containers
Properly cleaned and covered treatment table
Properly cleaned floors and surfaces with no visible blood or body fluids
Materials stored in sturdy and proper housing

, A good acupuncturist will give you about an hour per appointment. This gives you ample time to discuss your reasons for visiting as well as any goals you may have for your treatment. Make sure to ask any questions you have and answer anything your acupuncturist asks you.Make sure the acupuncturist allows you to discuss your wishes and concerns. A good acupuncturist is a good listener. They will often allot more time with you if it’s your first visit. See if the acupuncturist is writing down what you say, which is a good sign that they are really listening to you.
Pay attention and answer any questions the acupuncturist asks you. The questions may seem strange, but remember that acupuncturists approach health holistically. Make sure the doctor answers any questions you have.
Recognize that during the discussion, you should get a good sense of your personal connection with the acupuncturist. You should be able to establish a healing relationship with your acupuncturist and if the person doesn’t make you feel comfortable and calm, then it might be a good idea to try a different practitioner.

, As a part of your initial consultation with the acupuncturist, make sure to talk about your expectations and the length of time the practitioner thinks it will take to treat you. Chronic illnesses may require months of treatment before you start seeing an effect. Having an idea of how long your treatment will last can keep you from switching acupuncturists because of perceived lack of progress.Ask your acupuncturist if they will work with your traditional medical doctor to create a custom plan for you. This can be especially useful if you are suffering from a chronic illness such as cancer.
Ask about complementary services your acupuncturist offers. Some may prescribe herbal supplements to complement other medications or suggest massages in addition to acupuncture.

, After your consultation, your acupuncturist will likely begin your treatment. As long as you are comfortable, lie down on the treatment bed and allow them to insert the acupuncture needles into the locations corresponding to your problem areas. Make sure to ask any questions you may have during or after the treatment.


Let the acupuncturist know if you are uncomfortable at any point. If the practitioner doesn’t do their best to make you comfortable, consider looking for a new acupuncturist.

For example, you may want to set your crystal on a table or banister outside, or on an open windowsill facing the moon or sun.
Allow your crystal to be exposed to light for about 24 hours. You may need to leave your crystal in place for a couple of days or nights to make sure that it receives adequate light.;

Some people consider salt to be a metaphysical purification tool. To use salt to purify your crystals, you can wash your crystals with salty water, place crystals within a circle of salt, or bury crystals in salt. All of these techniques can help to purify the energy of your crystals.To use saltwater, dissolve about a teaspoon of salt in lukewarm water and place your crystal in the water. Allow the crystal to sit in the water for a few minutes and then remove it from the water, rinse it with non-salty water, and then dry it off with a towel.
To use a salt circle, lay your crystal on a cloth, plate, or other non-permeable surface. Then take a canister of salt and pour enough out around your crystal to create a circle. Allow your crystal to sit within the circle for an hour or more.
To bury your crystal in salt, place your crystal into a bowl and then pour enough salt over the crystal to cover the crystal completely. Allow the crystal to remain buried in the salt for an hour or more.

, In many disciplines, the smoke that comes from certain plants when they are burned is thought to have purifying powers.Sage, Santo Palo and Cedar are all considered to have these properties. By bathing the crystal with smoke from the burning of these plants, it is thought that bad energy will be removed.


Try burning some incense or a sage stick and holding your crystal above the smoke. Allow the smoke to surround your crystal for a few minutes to help purify it.
Sometimes bird feathers are used to fan the smoke. Beware that it may be illegal to own parts of certain birds.
Be careful when burning plant materials inside. You don't want fire, just smoke. Let it smolder, not burn.

, Many Catholic churches have holy water available to people who visit the church. Especially in churches that are tourist attractions, it is often possible to bring a modestly sized container to fill with water. You can then use it to purify your crystal of bad energy.Some tourist-frequented churches even have small gift shops that sell containers for you to use.


To use holy water to purify a crystal, place your crystal into a small bowl and pour a small amount of holy water onto the crystal. You do not need to immerse the crystal in holy water, just pour enough on it to get it wet. Then, remove your crystal from the bowl and dry it off.

You can hold the stone in a river or a brook for a few minutes, leave it out in the rain for a few hours, or hold it under a water faucet for a few minutes.You can also bathe the crystal in saltwater for a few minutes. Place the crystals in a mesh bag and put them in ocean water or a bowl of salt water for a few hours.
Do not use water on soft stones like anglite, dolomite, malachite, sulphur, etc, as it could dissolve the stone. Salt can also dissolve the finish on some stones, so do not put delicate stones in salt water.

, Put the stone on a windowsill or outside in direct sunlight for an hour. Keep in mind over time, sunlight can fade the color of some stones.Alternatively, you can place the stone in moonlight for one night under a full moon or longer if the moon is not full.

Then place your crystal directly into the empty glass. If you're looking to cleanse your crystals with salt, this is the best method to use if you have fragile crystals.Another option is to leave the crystals next to a bag of quartz clusters for one day. Quartz clusters can help to magnify, focus, and transmute energy. Use a large bag of crystal quartz chips or clusters and place them next to the crystals for one day.Use a bell or tuning fork over the crystals. Sound can help to cleanse the crystals, such as the ringing of a bell or the hum of a tuning fork. You can also use a chime over the crystals to remove any negativity in them.Try putting the crystals under a glass pyramid. You can find glass pyramids at a new age store and online.

Flow from mountain to chair to tree.",How to Do Shin Hugs2," It's best to start any yoga practice with a moment of meditation to bring your focus to your breath and tune out the outside world.

Square your hips by moving your core muscles, rather than trying to force your hips into position.

, To complete the one-legged king pigeon pose, reach back and grab your foot with your hands to bind the position. Find the equilibrium by pulling with your hands at the same time that you resist with your foot for an intense thigh stretch.If you have difficulty catching your foot at first, you can use a yoga strap to modify the pose so it's easier for you to do. Loop the strap around your left foot and hold it in your left hand. When you reach up and bend your knee, pull on the strap as far as you comfortably can.

, As with any one-sided yoga pose, hold for 5 to 10 breathing cycles, then return to your starting position and repeat the same movements with the opposite leg. Observe how each side feels different, and make accommodations as necessary if one side is stiffer than the other."

You can choose a place indoors or outdoors, but take care that you are in a safe place where you're unlikely to be interrupted.You'll probably want to close your eyes while you're in many of these poses, so find a place where you can do this without fear. For example, a public park might not be the best place to do restorative yoga if you feel you will not be able to fully relax there.;
, Restorative yoga should be an entirely supported and comfortable experience that allows you to relax fully. A number of props are necessary to ensure this, but you don't necessarily have to buy any fancy yoga props.If you already have yoga props such as a yoga mat and yoga blocks, you will find them beneficial when doing restorative yoga. You'll also want several large blankets or towels, as well as a few pillows.
If you don't have any yoga props, choose a thick blanket to lay on the floor and several pillows of varying degrees of firmness. Rolled blankets or towels also can be used.
Since most of these poses are timed, you'll want to have a timer nearby so that you will be alerted when the time is up. The timer should have a soothing tone when it alerts, not something shocking or jarring.

, Relaxing music can help you get into a calm, restorative state. Typically the music that works best is classical or instrumental music. You can also find meditation mixes through online music services for this purpose.You don't want anything too fast or complex. Choose slower music without lyrics.

, Begin your restorative yoga session by coming to a comfortable seat, supported by blankets and pillows as necessary. You may want to wrap a blanket around your shoulders and torso for additional warmth.Typically yogis will sit cross-legged, but if this position isn't comfortable for you, choose something else.
The most important part of how you sit is to make sure that your spine is straight and neutral so that you are sitting up straight without arching your spine. Your chest and heart should be directly over your pelvis.

, As you begin your restorative yoga practice, clear your mind and bring your focus to your breath as you breathe slowly and deeply. On each inhale, expand your belly and lift your chest. With each exhale, pull your navel towards your spine to squeeze the air out.If you're just starting out, breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Open your throat so as you exhale you're making a ""ha"" sound in the back of your throat. With practice, you'll be able to keep your throat open while your mouth is closed and make this sound as you exhale through your nose.
A deep meditation isn't necessary to connect with your breath, but you do need to take a few minutes to sit and connect your mind and body before you begin your restorative yoga practice.

, The supported heart opener will help create space in your chest and allow you to relax and release tension in your chest, shoulders, and back. This pose is good if you've been sitting at a desk hunched over a computer for a long period of time.To start, use a bolster or rolled towels and pillows. Lay them out on the floor so that they will extend the length of your spine, then place another folded blanket or pillow where your head and neck will be.
Lay down on your back on top of this support, allowing your shoulder blades to roll down your back and draw in towards each other. Spread your feet about hip-width apart and relax your legs. Rest your arms on the floor along your sides, palms facing upwards.

Make sure your shoulders are neutral, with your shoulder blades flowing down your spine, and your neck isn't crunched. Use support where needed to ensure this.
Remain in this position for about five minutes, relaxing and breathing deeply. Then slowly roll back up to a seated position and repeat on the other side.

, The supported bridge pose requires a yoga block for support. If you don't have a yoga block, you may want to skip this pose.

, Legs-up-the-wall pose is a go-to yoga pose to relieve stress and anxiety. It also has restorative properties for you if you've been sitting in the same position for a long time, such as on a long car ride or after a long flight.Move a mat or blanket close to a wall to cushion yourself. You can also use a bolster or rolled blanket to support your pelvis and hips if they are tight. You may want another blanket or pillow for your head as well.

Engage your core to protect your lower back.
Hold this position for between one and three minutes, then reach up and grab your knees to bend your legs slightly and move them back together. You may want to hug your legs to your chest for a few breath cycles.

, This pose is a modification of the thread-the-needle pose in which your body is fully supported by the floor and the wall. You'll further open each of your hips with this pose.From the legs-up-the-wall position, cross your left ankle so that it sits just above your right knee and flex your left foot.
Slowly draft your right foot down the wall, bending your knee as you rotate your left hip outward. Slide down as low as you comfortably can, then hold the position for one to three minutes before returning to legs-up-the-wall position and switching sides.

, Downward-facing rest is a soothing, relaxing pose that will naturally calm you and relieve stress. For this pose you will need a mat, a blanket and a bolster, or two towels or blankets.Put the short end of your mat against a wall, with the bolster or a rolled blanket at the end of the mat next to the wall. Take your other towel or blanket and fold it over itself three times, placing it in the middle of your mat.
Lie down on your stomach with the tops of your feet resting against the bolster and your pelvis on the folded blanket. Drop your tailbone towards the floor. Turn your head to the right and rest your cheek against the floor.
Extend your right arm out from your shoulder, your elbow bent at a right angle so your palm is across from your face. Let your left arm fall straight down your side.
Hold this position for about five minutes, then switch sides, turning your head to the left and adjusting your arms accordingly.

, With this restorative yoga position, you can gently twist your spine while remaining entirely supported and comfortable. You still should not attempt this pose if you are recovering from a recent back injury.Gather a bolster and a blanket for your head. Lie on your back with your head on the blanket, setting the bolster beside your legs. Bend your knees so that the soles of your feet are resting flat on the floor.
Extend your arms out comfortably to either side of your body – they can be straight out from your shoulders, or more upward, whichever feels more comfortable. Keep your spine pressed neutrally against the floor, and draw your shoulder blades down along your spine.
Let your knees drift toward the bolster, keeping your shoulders anchored to the floor. Allow your knees to rest on the bolster. Maintain this twist for about five minutes, then do the other side.
To draw yourself out of this pose, pull your knees back to center on an exhale and wrap your arms around your shins, giving yourself a hug. Drop your feet down to the floor, spread wide apart so that your knees fall together. Place your hands on your belly and breathe deeply several times.

, Child's pose is perhaps the ultimate calming and relaxing yoga pose. As such, it's ideal to reduce stress and a good final pose for any yoga session. Use pillows or rolled blankets to support your head and neck so that you can fully relax in this position.To enter the pose, sit on your heels with your knees spread hip-width apart or wider, big toes touching. Hinge forward from your hips, extending your arms out in front of you.
Fold forward as far as you comfortably can. If you cannot fold all the way to the floor, use blankets or pillows to make up the difference. Rest your head comfortably, keeping your shoulders neutral and your neck long and relaxed.
A good way to make sure your shoulders are in correct position is to check your inner elbows. When your palms are faced downward toward the floor, your inner elbow creases should be facing upward.
Relax completely and breathe deeply. Hold this pose for at least five minutes, or as long as you want.

Consult your prenatal physician before starting prenatal yoga.,
Find a local class to join.,
Only practice yoga when you feel up to it and at your convenience.,
Avoid certain postures that are not pregnancy-friendly while doing prenatal yoga.,
Be careful not to do too much.,
Pay close attention to your breathing.,
Always cool down after you are finished.,
Use what you learned during your prenatal yoga classes to take on the stresses of everyday life during your pregnancy.",How to Do Prenatal Yoga," Always follow your doctor’s advice. As long as you are in good health with no pregnancy complications, your doctor will likely give you the go ahead.


If you have lower back problems or have a history of miscarriages, then prenatal yoga might not be for you. If your physician does not think that prenatal yoga is a safe activity for the both of you, you can inquire about safe, alternative methods that may have a similar effect as prenatal yoga.;
, If you are new to yoga, it’s probably not a good idea to start the exercises on your own, without proper instruction. Although yoga exercises are generally considered safe and are beginner-friendly, performing the moves improperly during pregnancy may put both you and your pregnancy at risk. Starting out under the instruction of a trained yoga instructor will significantly cut the risk of injury.


Your local prenatal yoga class will have a trained instructor who will guide you through the steps. This will help you set realistic goals, especially if you are just beginning. Because yoga can be a strenuous activity, you don’t want to take on too much. Your prenatal yoga class should help you calm your mind and relax your body. When you are relaxed, so is your baby.
Try to find a yoga studio that has instructors who are trained in prenatal yoga techniques or offer prenatal yoga classes. Some studios offer prenatal yoga classes designed specifically for expectant mothers. Although you can attend a general yoga class and modify the movements for pregnancy, attending a class that is full of other expectant mothers will likely help you feel more relaxed and at ease. It also allows you to focus on the instructions and pay attention to your body without having to worry about modifying the moves or whether or not they are safe for you and your baby.

, Do not feel like you have to attend every class or practice yoga every day. This should be a therapeutic experience, helping you relieve stress.

, While most instructors will understand this basic fact, it is a smart idea to also stay informed about your limitations to keep you and your baby safe.


Keep from overexerting your back and spine.
Refrain from doing stretches and postures that put too much pressure on your lower lumbar and abdomen.
Consider using props such as pillows and padded yoga equipment to keep you balanced.
Monitor the amount of sweat your body is excreting. While working up a light sweat is fine, make sure you do not overdo it. Remember that it is important for you to stay hydrated during pregnancy. Excess sweating causes you to lose liquids quickly. Stick to a light sweat at the most, and make sure you replenish lost fluids with plenty of water after the class.

, There are more risks involved with overexertion than with doing too little. Always err on the side of caution. If you think you can push yourself just a little bit harder, it may be best to back off. Take it easy and pay attention to your body during workouts. Save the heavy stuff for after the baby is born.

, Breathing is one of the most important parts of both yoga and childbirth. Proper breathing techniques will not only help you manage your stress, but also keep necessary oxygen in your lungs.


One of the most prevalent breathing practices in prenatal yoga is breathing in and out slowly through your nose. This is one of the most calming breathing techniques because it allows you to pace your mind and body.

, Cooling down will keep you from cramping, it will help you unwind and it will allow you to recap your latest prenatal yoga experience. Keeping your muscles loose now will pay off during labor and delivery.

, One of the reasons why prenatal yoga is an excellent option is because it teaches you to relax while under stress. Nothing is worse for a pregnancy than stress and anxiety. If you are experiencing a difficult day, then use the breathing techniques that you learned in prenatal yoga, and help ease the tension away.

Ask your current yoga teacher to do paddleboard yoga.,
Arrive to class early.,

Keep things secured to your body.,
Factor in the cost to your budget.,
Consider your safety.",How to Do Paddleboard Yoga," Paddleboard yoga can be a change for even experienced practitioners. To help you get balanced and used to your board, start by getting into child's pose.Stand toward the back end of your paddle board. Keep your feet about hip width apart to help maintain your balance.
Squat down until you're on your hands and knees. Slowly ease your butt down towards your feet so that it's resting on or very close to your heels.
Your knees should be pointing out slightly away from your body. Drape your torso forward and rest your forehead on the board.
You can keep your arms extended straight out in front of you or rest them next to your body.
Stay in child's pose for a few deep breaths. Get accustomed to the ripples of the water and the feeling of being on a paddle board.;
, A great pose to practice on your paddle board is Warrior 1. Being on the water will force you to concentrate during this pose in order to maintain your balance.Stand toward the backside of your board. Lunge your left foot forward. Keep your toes pointing straight ahead of you. Angle your back right foot out towards the side of your body at about a 45 degree angle.
Lower your body down so that your left thigh is almost parallel to your paddle board.
Extend your arms up over your head and slightly arch your back. Point your face up to towards the sky. Take a few deep breaths and then switch sides to perform with your other leg.
Focus on your hands or on the sky and take a few deep breaths to hold this pose.

, Another great pose to try on your paddle board is tree pose. Again, being on the water makes this balancing pose slightly more challenging.Stand in the middle of your paddle board. While focusing on an object straight ahead of you (maybe a particular tree on the shore line), slowly bring up your right leg.
Rest your feet on the inner thigh of your left leg (above your knee joint) or on the inner part of your left shin (below your knee) joint.
Try to press your foot into your left leg and vice versa. Sweep your arms up over your head so that your fingers are extended towards the sky.
Balance here for a few deep breaths and then alternate sides.

, This classic yoga pose is another great one to try on the paddle board. It can be a little challenging since your view is upside down. However, it's great to practice your balance.To start this pose, position yourself on your hands and knees towards the center of your paddle board. Get comfortable and balanced here.
Plant your hands firmly into your board. They should be about shoulder width apart.
Then, curl your toes under and push your butt up into the air. Your body should be forming an upside down ""V"" shape.
Push up through your arms and hips towards the sky. Also, try to pull your heels as close to the board as you can.
Stay here for a few deep breaths before moving onto another pose.

, Most yoga classes will end in corpse pose. It's a closing pose that allows your body to relax after a challenging workout. This pose is exceptionally calming and restoring when you're floating on your paddle board.Corpse pose is performed by laying on your back. Try to center your body, with your face pointing up towards the sky, on the paddle board.
Typically, your arms and legs should be slightly splayed out from the sides of your body - at about a 45 degree angle.
Yoga paddle boards are large enough that you don't have to dangle your limbs into the water. However, allowing your hands or feet to dangle in the cool water can help you relax and feel one with the water and board.
Stay in corpse pose for several minutes. Just allowing your body to relax and reconnect with nature.

, Paddleboard yoga is becoming more popular. However, you may need to do a little digging online in order to find a local class.


Do a quick online search for paddleboard yoga. Classes will most likely be offered near lakes, rivers or other bodies of water.
Make sure to check the timing of the class, the schedule, required equipment or clothing and the cost.
Even if you cannot find a class that's in your town or city, look for a class in a fun destination. It might be fun to take a trip with friends or family and as part of your trip include a paddleboard yoga class or two.

, If you can't find a local paddleboard yoga class, but live near a body of water, consider asking a yoga teacher to venture out to teach one of these unique classes.


Paddleboard yoga isn't offered as frequently as traditional yoga. If you're interested in taking a paddleboard yoga class, consider asking your current yoga teacher if they'd be interested.
Tell them you'd may be able to help them get together a group of people that would be willing to pay a fee to attend the class.
You may want to consider asking local yoga instructors around your area if they'd be interested in teaching a class if you don't currently have a yoga teacher or don't know one personally.

, Like any new fitness class, it might be wise to show up early. This will help you get acquainted with the teacher, your board and the equipment that's used.


If you've signed up for a paddleboard yoga class, plan to arrive to class at least 15-20 minutes early.
When you're there, get to know the instructor a bit. Ask about what to expect from the class and mention that this is your first paddleboard class.
Also get acquainted with the equipment. The paddle boards can be heavy and difficult to get into the water. Ask the instructor for help if you need it., Paddleboard yoga will require you to bring the right type of equipment and wear the right type of clothing.Make sure that you have:


Water proof clothing. A swim suit, yoga clothes or other fitness clothes that you don't mind getting wet are key. Although it's not planned for you to fall in the water, it could happen if you lose your balance.
Water proof shoes. Little flat, slip on water shoes are great. You can walk into the water and they can help keep you from slipping on your board.
Dry clothes and a towel. Just in case, keep an extra set of clothes and a dry towel for when you're done with your class.
Water bottle. Keep this filled with ice cold water so that when you're finished with class, you can rehydrate.
Sun glasses, hat or suntan lotion. Since you'll be outside, it's important to stay protected from the sun. Any of the items would be good to have for a sunny day.

, Since paddleboard yoga is done on the water, it's possible that you can drop something and lose it. Instead, make sure you have things secured to your body.


It might be wise to bring a hat and sunglasses. However, make sure they are either securely fitted on your head (like a tight fitting hat) or your glasses are attached to a chain around your neck.
If you want to bring a cell phone out in the water with you (maybe to play music if you're alone), keep it in an arm or wrist case that's securely fastened to your body and is completely water proof.

, Like many types of fitness classes, there is a cost associated with paddleboard yoga. Make sure the class fee is feasible for you and fits into your budget.


Each paddleboard yoga class will have a cost associated with it. Depending on where you go, the cost per session could be anywhere from $30-$40.Many yoga teachers or studios do offer a discount if you purchase a class series, you're a student or military. Look for these if you want to cut down on the overall cost.
Since there is a higher cost associated with this specialty form of yoga, this may be something you can only do once in a while - like once a month.

, All types of exercise, even yoga, require you to be safe and smart. Talk to your doctor before starting this class and make sure it's an appropriate class for you.


Always get a clearance from your doctor for physical activity. Although yoga is fairly good for any fitness level, being out in the hot sun on the water may present some issues for certain people.
Also, even though it's not likely you'll fall into the water, make sure you're OK and feel safe in water. Knowing how to swim or at least how to tread water is essential.
Many classes insist that students wear small flotation devices. If you'd feel more comfortable with one, make sure to ask or bring your own.

Being out in nature can be tranquil, or you might find a secluded part of your home.Try to find the best time of day. Early morning typically is a good time to meditate, and you can carry the peace with you throughout the day. It's also usually quiet at that time.
When you first start, you may find it helpful to have some soft music playing in the background, or listening through earphones.
You also can search online for guided meditation tracks that are designed to help you focus when you're new to the practice.;
, Raja yoga meditation is done from a seated position. A simple cross-legged position is fine, or you can even sit in a chair if you need that support. Just make sure you're comfortable and that you feel stable.When in cross-legged position, press your hip bones down and reach up through the crown of your head. Your shoulders should drop down your back with your chest opened. Make sure your spine is neutral. Don't arch your back or lean back or forward.
It may help to place a folded blanket or rolled towel behind or under you to help with your posture and make you more comfortable.

, Raja yoga traditionally is done with your eyes open. When you're just starting, however, you may need to close your eyes so that you can center your mind.Try to keep your eyes open at first, then close them if you're having difficulty or get distracted too easily. You will get better at it the more you practice.
It can help to light a candle and focus your eyes on the flame.

, Turn your attention to your breathing, or to your other point of focus, such as a candle in front of you. Allow your thoughts to pass without judgement.Particularly when you're just starting, your mind will probably try to throw all kinds of things at you. As you relax, things may come to mind that you'd forgotten throughout the day. Simply acknowledge those thoughts and return to your breath or point of focus.
Observe without judging or criticizing yourself or your mind. Don't fault or blame yourself if it takes you awhile to get settled. Once you get settled, if another thought comes, have patience. Acknowledge the thought and allow the thought to pass, and then return to your breath or point of focus.

, As your thoughts start to flow, set an intention for your practice. Let that thought be your awareness as you sit in meditation. It could be related to some struggle you're currently having, or just a general affirmation.For example, your thought might be ""I am a peaceful soul."" Try to empty your mind to the point that this is the only thought that exists.
Your thought may be more directed to your personal circumstances. For example, if you are currently undergoing some uncertainty, such as turmoil at work, you might make your thought something like ""my well-being is not attached to any outcome.""

, As you fall deeper into a meditative state, your thought will bloom into a feeling that radiates through your entire being. Your understanding and feelings will combine to produce a profound sense of realization.For example, if your original thought was ""I am a peaceful soul,"" you can nurture that thought by repeating things such as ""I am a peaceful soul...I am a peaceful being...Peace is my original nature.""

, When your meditation is over, try to hold on to the inner peace you found during meditation as you go through your day. If you feel the peace slipping away, take a few moments if you can for a brief meditation to re-center yourself.Over time and with practice, you will awaken into a more profound state of well-being. You will be able to focus and concentrate better because you are centering and grounding yourself through your practice.
If you feel stressed or overwhelmed during the day, try to find a place where you can retreat, even if only for a minute. Take several deep breaths and focus on your breathing until you find your inner calm.

, Deep, focused breathing is the heart of hatha yoga practice. To begin practicing correct breath, sit in a comfortable position and begin to breathe deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth.As you inhale, lift your chest and allow your belly to expand. Think of the air filling your lungs from the bottom all the way to the top.
When you exhale, press your navel towards your spine and press the air out of your lungs slowly and steadily. Think about the air at the top of your lungs leaving first, then the next layer, and so on. Make a whispered ""ha"" sound in the back of your throat as you exhale. With practice, you can exhale through your nose while still making this sound in your throat.
As you get more skilled, you can try to find a pause after each inhalation and each exhalation, rather than rushing to breathe. In the pause after an inhale, recognize how full of life-giving air you are. After each exhale, feel the opening of space.

, While technically you don't need anything to do yoga, there are a number of props and other materials that can make it easier for you to get started in the practice.You probably will want to get a yoga mat, which provides a non-slip surface as well as giving you some padding. You may want to get a thicker mat, such as a pilates mat or a regular exercise mat, if you are new to the practice or if you need more cushioning on a hard floor.
You also may want to buy yoga blocks, which can help keep you grounded in bends if you are not flexible enough yet to bend all the way to the floor.
Consider also including a couple of towels or a throw blanket with your yoga gear as well. These can be used to cushion your joints, particularly if you have stiff knees.

, If you're just starting a yoga practice, beginner poses can help you build a better awareness of your body. Most beginner poses don't require tremendous balancing or flexibility, and have longer hold times.Search online for good beginner poses. There are plenty of free resources online, with photos and step-by-step instructions, as well as instructional videos you can watch. Here are the names of some basic poses to search for: cat, cat-cow, downward-facing dog, puppy, child's pose, cobra, mountain, forward bend, seated twist, and wide-legged forward bend.
You also can learn poses and sequences by buying a yoga book or video designed for beginners. If you've never done a pose before, watch the video once through before you attempt to follow along.

, Hatha yoga allows you to attain a greater connection between your mind and body by practicing physical poses or asanas. Understanding the relationship between the two types can help you focus your hatha yoga practice.Hatha yoga originally was developed to build strength and flexibility in the yogi's body, so that they could sit comfortably and meditate for several hours at a time.
If you get to the point in your Raja yoga practice that you are meditating for extended periods of time, hatha yoga can help you.
Ancient swamis also believed that having a strong and energetic body made it easier for you to attain the self-discipline and self-control necessary to advance in raja yoga.

, One of the main principles of raja yoga is non-violence. Since the consumption of meat involves the death of an animal, yogis typically become vegetarians. The further you advance in your practice, the more interested you may become in giving up meat.Raja yoga includes eight steps toward enlightenment, the first of which is self-control. Nonviolence is part of this first step, which means without becoming a vegetarian you ultimately will not achieve enlightenment. However, not everyone wishes to progress that far with their practice.
Keep in mind that you do not have to become a vegetarian to meditate, or to gain benefit from a daily meditation practice. This is a decision you must come to on your own, in your own time.

, You certainly don't have to give away everything you own to benefit from meditation. But as you progress in raja yoga, you probably will find that you have less and less attachment to material possessions.The principle of non-accumulation of material belongings also is included in the first step on the raja yoga path to enlightenment.
The essence of this principle is to acquire only those things that you need to live. So, for example, if you live alone, there is no need to have a full set of dishes – you only need one plate, one spoon, one glass, and one set of silverware.
Non-accumulation applies to people as well. Yogis do not hold onto others or foist their own beliefs and expectations on others, but rather allow them the freedom to be their own people and follow their own paths.

, Yogis who follow raja yoga believe that sex should only be for procreation. If you are not procreating, or attempting to procreate, you should abstain from sex if you want to reach a state of enlightenment.This yogic principle of purity goes beyond merely sexual abstinence, however. It also means you live a life of complete purity, with your thoughts turned always toward God.

, If you aspire to follow the raja yoga path, it is your responsibility to understand the principles and ideas upon which it is founded. The traditional texts can assist you on your meditative journey.Key books to read include the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads, and the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.
Keep in mind that you don't have to believe everything in these books, or in other yogic teachings, to benefit from a meditative practice. Hold what you want and don't worry about the rest, but keep your mind open. As you continue to meditate, you might find yourself going back to those teachings and finding something new in them.

, Letting go of the idea of being stylish or following trends is part of embracing non-attachment to material possessions. Clothing ideally should be made of natural fibers, to comport with the yogic principle of purity.Light-colored clothing typically is the least distracting, and is often favored by raja yoga practitioners.
Avoid synthetic fabrics, since these are impure. You also should try to avoid brightly colored clothing or clothing with loud patterns that is designed to get attention.
Stay away from clothing or shoes made from leather or fur, as these require the death of an animal.

See your doctor.,
Ventilate.,
Take ibuprofen for pain if you have any from swelling from the infection.,
Treat the symptoms with everything you got.,
Drink lots of chamomile and menthol tea.,
When you feel like it, opt to block your nose rather than blowing it.,
Use sage.",How to Beat Nasal Head Colds With Garden Plants," There is no substitute for a doctor's advice. Your general practitioner will be happy to see you with a common cold, if you pay them! If you want to waste money going to the doctor for a nasal head cold, do it. If you want to waste the time of a National Health medical professional, you can go to your GP too. You may prefer to go to a chemist or pharmacy, especially as nothing but time can cure your cold! All that can be done is lessen the symptoms. You don't need a doctor to tell you to keep up your fluid intake, take decongestants if you find them helpful and use appropriate pain killers if you feel the need. Of course, as a doctor about this if you find that you do require professional advice.;
, As well as using garden plants, you can try fresh air circulation. It gives your body less chance to re-contaminate itself and continue the infection from bacteria suspended in the water particles blown out when you exhale. Change your sheets every couple days, if you feel up to it.

, Don't be afraid to absolutely max out on the advised amount on the side of the box. If your pain is not alleviated with the maximum dose suggested on the packaging, the pain is not ""minor"" and a doctor should be consulted, but you can supplement with acetaminophen or aspirin. If you don't choose to take ibuprofen, you can substitute with naproxen, but don't combine naproxen with ibuprofen. It is both more expensive and less effective. If you are taking any of these, alcohol can not be used for a topical analgesia.

, Don't just stick to herbs, unless you are doing this for religious experience. Diphenhydramine is an OTC antihistamine that can also be used for head colds, and produces marked drowsiness. Effective (also) to help you sleep, especially where pain interrupts. It is not excessively expensive. Other antihistamines may help (read the label and decide if so), but again cost money. Guaifenesin and DMX are common medicines, the primary ones in many OTC symptom relief medicines, however they are minimally effective for acute head colds, especially at OTC dosage levels.

, Take showers often. Hot, moist air is itself good for nasal infections. Menthol will help clear the nasal passages, and stimulates nerves, producing an numbing effect like the ""icy-hot"" patches that athletes use (although nowhere near that strong when drinking a simple tea). Chamomile has a topical analgesic effect from glycine, and both plants (and in fact almost all plants) have some antibacterial effect. These numbing effects can be seen to have a further anti-septic effect in that the numbed tissue will produce less mucus to carry and spread the disease within your body.

, Blowing your nose and wiping it rubs the skin raw, which inflames the surrounding tissue and causes further mucus production. If you feel like throwing up from all the ""post-nasal drip"" (and/or guaifenesin), you might try gently and patiently wetting the tissues before wiping your nose with them. The amount of water needed depends on the tissue, and sufficiently but not overly wetting tissues is a subtle science that by the time you have mastered you will want to give seminars on its nuances, although the only people who are likely to listen are the few in the back of the crowd who look on with awe and remembrance of their recent head cold.

, You can drink sage tea but a simpler/arguably more effective remedy exists for nasal infections. When you can breathe through your nose, take a fresh, clean leaf of sage, roll it once or twice, and insert stem-side-first a little into your nose, on the side more infected. Breathe in through it and out through your mouth for ~5-15 minutes. Do this 3-4 times per day (after showers or tea is sometimes best for being able to breathe). You can also crumple the leaf and use it to stop up your nose when you want one nostril or the other to stop. Sage leaves have antibacterial, and antibiotic (the chemical Salvin) and antiseptic qualities and can greatly reduce recovery times.

First know what the professionals do.,
Speak with local funeral homes and inquire if they know of companies that can assist you.,
Contact companies that provide Cryonic preservation of human remains.,
Check with their licensing agency and verify the center is in good standing, has passed required inspections, and see if any complaints have been made.

,
Discuss the process and understand what will be required in your last days.,
Speak to your physicians and make them aware of your request.,
Contact the administration at your local hospital.,
Speak with your family and make sure they understand your request.,
Speak with your attorney and make sure all details are covered in the language of your Last Will and Testament.

,
Coordinate with your attorney to appoint someone trustworthy who will make sure your wishes are met and you are frozen as planned.,
Anticipate problems.,
Hire an inspector or a trusted family member to check that things are alright from time to time.",How to Be Cryonically Preserved," Go to http://science.howstuffworks.com/cryonics.htm or http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/newtechnology.html, or The Cryonics Institute home page to find out. Make sure you understand the process and everything involved.


The first thing the professionals would do is to cool you down, especially your head/brain.
They would set a machine that pumps your heart to keep alive as much tissue as possible.
Your blood will be replaced with several solutions to both help preserve your body/brain, and to protect your cells from freezing damage.
They will slowly cool your body to the temperature of liquid nitrogen using a controlled cooling box.
They will then wrap your body in a waterproof sheath and submerge you in liquid nitrogen for long term storage until such a time as you can can be revived and restored to full health (this could take decades, if not likely centuries).;
,


Even though you are not being buried or cremated you will likely still need the services of the local funeral home to transport your remains and sign required paperwork. They may work with the cryonics company to meet your requests.

, Alcor and the Cryonics Institute are the two biggest CSPs in the world.

,,


In some instances you may need to make arrangements to have your remains transported to a facility.

,


Make sure your physician is aware of any and all releases and paperwork that may may be required. The Cryonics company will make you aware of the required paperwork once you have finalized your arrangements.

, This process isn't common and there may be procedures they will need to coordinate with the Cryonics company.

,


Be sensitive. The decision to be frozen will prevent your family from having a traditional funeral.
If you wish, make plans for a memorial or wake or a service with only your photo displayed. This may help the grieving process and helps people to cope with your loss.

,, This may be a power of attorney or other legal representative.

, Understand your family may protest this unconventional process. Have a plan to deal with family bickering after you've passed. Speak to your attorney about ways to prevent family members from altering your plans.


Appreciate the company could close, natural or man made disasters could take place or their could be a malfunction. Let them know of secondary plans should the freezing process be interrupted. Have these plans outlined in your agreement and make sure your family is aware.

, Make this an annual inspection that is required by your will. If there seem to be problems with the company storing your remains your attorney or family can begin the process of having you moved to a different facility.

Stay as fit as possible, so buildup with exercise while in cancer treatment, and you will:Improve blood flow -- keep the blood vessels and heart tuned up.,
Increase your ability to recover through regular exercise.,
Reduce your chance of weight gain through aerobic exercises.,
Stay active to reduce fatigue.,
Boost your immune system through regular exercise.,
Exercise to boost moods and avoid depression.,
Remain physically active to feel in control of your body.,
Exercise regularly to maintain your quality of life.",How to Battle Cancer Symptoms With Exercise," Doing exercise comparable to 6 or more hours of walking in a week showed a 47% higher chance of survival without recurrence.Although this may feel taxing to cancer patients, and especially to those suffering from fatigue or nausea from chemotherapy or radiation treatments, walking (a light form of aerobic exercise) will help diminish cancer symptoms.Even walking one hour per week, can improve the health of cancer patients who have completed their treatment, compared to cancer patients who do not exercise at all.Getting up and taking a short walk can help keep the circulation healthy in the extremities. A short five minute walk a few times a day may not sound like a lot. Nevertheless, you will feel better in the interim.;
, Focus on forms of exercise like:Running/jogging, hiking, or walking.
Dancing or rowing.
Skiing or snowboarding in winter.

, Cancer patients can gain the most benefits through adding weight training, or other forms of resistance training (such as using resistance bands) to their workout regimen.You could start as simply as sitting in a chair and lifting a can of food in each hand. Work up to more resistance for example: two quart and then gallon size jugs of water to lift. If you live near a city-senior center, or a commercial gym, you can work on strength training using dumbbells and barbells, or weight machines.

, An extended regimen of cancer treatments can leave a patient with poor muscle tone can lead to a longer recovery period. Doing simple strength-building exercises can keep muscles toned.Strength-training exercises will give you more energy, which is important if you feel fatigued or lethargic.


Strength training can also maintain bone density, which sometimes suffers during periods of inactivity during cancer treatment., Although often not considered a form of exercise on its own, stretching is important for cancer patients—especially those who are too fatigued or weak to engage in more active aerobics or weight training. Stretch as many areas as you can, by doing moves like shoulder shrugs, knee lifts, and overhead reaches. Hold each stretch for at least 30 seconds, then slowly relax your body.Stretching can also improve strength in specific bodily locations that may have been weakened during cancer treatment (especially surgery).Stretching will keep your joints and muscles limber.Prolonged periods of inactivity during cancer treatment will stiffen your muscles. Counteract this with regular stretching.

,
Recover more quickly -- following a moderate exercise routine/regimen.
Increase life expectancy -- building your body up and so including the immune system.
Reduce cancer reoccurring -- destroy some microscopic new cancers by healthy immune system .
Reduce fatigue -- by conditioning and toning the musculoskeletal system.
Decrease pain -- by exercising using low impact to develop tolerance.
Alleviate stress -- have a feeling of accomplishment/feel positive.
Improve balance -- keep muscles and nerves attuned to getting around
Build bone density -- put moderate weight/stress on bones and joints to make them stay stronger.
Prevent muscle loss -- use resistance training for muscles to stay in place.

, Recent studies have shown that cancer patients who maintain an exercise regimen are better able to withstand the harmful side effects of chemo therapy and radiation treatment.In many cases, patients who exercised regularly were able to handle stronger doses of chemo, which can lead to faster and more successful cancer eradication., Cancer treatments (especially chemo therapy) frequently lead to weight gain. Weight gain can also be a concern for cancer patients who lead an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. Aerobic exercises are best to help keep the weight off.Conversely, if your cancer treatment causes you nausea, aerobic exercise can sound stomach-turning.
For those dealing with inactivity (or even weight loss) due to nausea, moderate exercise can help soothe the stomach and allow food to become palatable again.

, Fatigue is a common symptom for cancer patients, especially for those going through chemo or radiation therapy. Although it may seem counterintuitive, regular exercise can diminish the amount of fatigue that you feel.Although cancer patients are often told to rest as much as possible, this advice can be counterproductive, as it will
Cancer patients who have developed a regular exercise regimen have also reported feeling fewer symptoms from their chemo therapy or radiation treatments., For individuals diagnosed with cancer, radiation therapy or chemo treatment may diminish your immune system, and catching other illnesses is a risk during this time. Regular, moderate exercise can keep your immune system at full strength and reduce your risk of catching illness., For those dealing with cancer treatment, mental health can be a concern. Depression and anxiety are major problems for anyone handling a regimen of cancer treatments. Physical exercise helps pleasure-producing hormones in the brain—these will elevate your mood and can help cancer patients avoid succumbing to despair or depression.


Even getting outside for five minutes at a time can make a significant difference in how a patient feels.

, Exercise can help to counteract the strong feelings of helplessness and fear that accompany cancer. Exercise will give you an encouraging sense of control over your body, and this will provide positive emotional support., If you regularly exercised before the cancer diagnosis and treatment began, getting back into exercise will give a note or normality. Even if you did not exercise before, getting out for a walk offers an opportunity to reconnect with neighbors and the neighborhood.


Going to a gym offers a chance to talk with people and get out of the house. Even taking a stroll down the hospital corridor opens up opportunities to speak with others and to see new faces.

Follow some manufacturer guidelines.,
Avoid water stagnation.,
Keep sources of warm water clean.,
Clean hot water heaters.,
Clean hot tubs and spas.,
Treat water systems with Legionella bacteria.",How to Avoid Legionella1," Manufacturer guidelines for hot water systems, air conditioning systems, and hot tubs should include provisions to prevent the spread of Legionella bacteria. Many of these provisions are specific to the appliance in question and can best be defined by the manufacturer itself.


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend the ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers) guidelines when it comes to the appropriate chemical treatment and temperatures of water in preventing legionellosis..
The first step is to avoid water temperatures between 20 to 45°C (77 to 104 °F). This range of temperature favors the growth of Legionella bacteria.;
, Legionella will grow faster if undisturbed, thus it lives in stagnant water. For this reason, you need to ensure that water systems are frequently used to prevent stagnation. This is particularly true for hot water heaters, which should remain on to forestall the development of bacteria., Scales and sentiment can protect Legionella from disinfectants. Any appliance that stores or distributes water in the temperature range of 20 to 45°C (77 to 104 °F) should be cleaned vigorously to eliminate scales and sentiment.Whirlpool spas, swimming pools and hot tubs should be chemically treated to prevent bacterial growth. They should also be routinely drained. The water should be changed at least once a month.
When using humidifiers for ill patients, especially those with pulmonary problems, use sterile water instead of tap water.
Change the water in decorative fountains at least once a week.
Check for obvious signs of dirt in showers. For example, when using the public shower in the gym, call the attention of the management when you see rust or dirt along the shower line.
Hot water heaters are particularly susceptible to Legionnaires’ disease, but cooling towers are too., You should have your hot water heater treated for Legionella regularly. The tank should be flushed and cleaned with disinfectant. The system should store water at 45°C (140°F). To maintain heat throughout the system you will need effective circulation and good insulation. Refrain from turning off the water heater, else more hospital temperatures and stagnant water will encourage the growth of Legionella bacteria., Legionella is especially common in hot tubs because it is difficult to maintain the appropriate disinfectant levels in warm water. Chlorine should be at 2 – 4 ppm (parts per million), bromine should be at 4 – 6 ppm, and pH at 7.2 – 7.8 ppm. Change the water regularly, replace the filter as recommended by the manufacturer, and remove slime and other biofilm with regular cleanings., Unfortunately, chlorination and moderate heat will not eliminate Legionella bacteria. To kill the bacteria, you will need to administer temperatures upwards of 45°C (140°F), disinfect with mono chloramine, or use copper-silver ionization."
"
Make sure all water systems are properly maintained.,
Clean hot tubs and spas.,
Perform water testing as part of risk assessment and management.",How to Avoid Legionella2," Landlords and other business owners should follow their legal duties of ensuring all water systems on their premises are properly maintained and operated.Depending upon what state you are in, there are specific regulations and requirements you need to comply with in order to legally operate your business.
Working with a water treatment company may be necessary if you do not have the skills, knowledge or competence to perform your legal health and safety duties.

, Businesses should test pH levels at least twice a day, more when the hot tub is crowded. Chlorine should be at 2 – 4 ppm (parts per million), bromine should be at 4 – 6 ppm, and pH at 7.2 – 7.8 ppm. You should also change the water regularly, replace the filter as recommended by the manufacturer, and remove slime and other biofilm with daily cleanings., You should have a professional risk assessment performed at least once every two years. You should also consider an assessment after changes to the water system, the building has changed used, or any cases of Legionnaire’s disease have been reported by customers.Water sampling should be done by an accredited laboratory or by the proper authority. Use your state-recommended provider to make sure you receive accurate results.
Note that all systems house some Legionella bacteria. The issue is how much and whether the bacteria is being distributed from the water system to customers."
"
Improve your immune system.,
Stop smoking.,
Drink alcohol in moderation.,
Know you suffer from risk factors.,
Be aware of the sources of Legionella.",How to Avoid Legionella3," If you are exposed to Legionella bacteria, this does not mean that you will automatically develop the disease; however, if your immune system is compromised, it is more likely that you will get infected. Get at least seven to nine hours of sleep every night. Furthermore, you should adhere to a well-balanced diet to improve your immune system. Foods good for your immune system include the following:


Yogurt is rich in probiotics (good bacteria) that many experts suggest will improve your immune system.Oats and barley contain beta-glucan which is a type of fiber rich in antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Eat one daily serving per day for a good boost in immunity.Garlic is extremely effective at improving the immune system; however, to get its full effect, you should consume the garlic raw. Heat and water will both neutralize important sulfur enzymes in garlic.Tea supports the production of virus-fighting interferon in the blood. The chemical that is responsible for this is known as the L-theanine., Smoking damages the lungs, leading to increased susceptibility to Legionnaires’ disease.Because Legionella bacteria infect the lungs, those who suffer from lung disease like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema, both of which are precipitated by smoking, are more likely to contract Legionnaires’ disease., Heavy consumption of alcoholic beverages puts you at higher risk for developing Legionnaires' disease.A dependence on alcohol or other drugs increases your risk because it reduces your immune system's ability to fight infection.Moderate alcohol consumption is less than one serving per day for women and less than two servings per day for men.

, Be careful if you are older 50, suffer from lung disease, have been a smoker, or if you have a compromised immune system. Potential causes of a compromised immune system include diseases like cancer, diabetes and liver failure, as well as drugs that are administered after transplants or chemotherapy., It is imperative that you are able to identify the conditions where Legionella thrives to avoid them if you are at risk. The principal sources of Legionella are warm water and steam.Be conscious of central air conditioning, hot water, misting systems, cooling towers, humidifiers, air humidifiers, showers, whirlpool spas, hot tubs, fountains, ponds, and creeks.Keep in mind that there is an increased chance of Legionella bacteria infesting a body of water if it is stagnant.

"
Recognize the symptoms.,
Visit the doctor.,
Beware the consequences of inaction.",How to Avoid Legionella4," The symptoms of Legionnaires’ disease include coughing, shortness of breath, high fever, muscle aches, and headaches. The symptoms are so similar to those of pneumonia that doctors can have trouble diagnosing it. If you have been exposed to steam recently and are exhibiting signs of pneumonia, you should inform your doctor.


The symptoms will usually appear between two and 10 days after initial exposure to the bacteria., If you are exhibiting signs of pneumonia visit the doctor and inform them of any potential risk factors. They will initiate a program of antibiotic treatment, which should generally be sufficient to cure the disorder., If Legionnaires’ disease is not treated it can result in lung failure and death. It is estimated that between 10 and 20 percent of those infected with Legionnaires’ disease die, but it is hard to estimate exactly, because most cases are confused with pneumonia."

Stand in mountain pose.,
Bend your knees into chair pose.,
Hinge into a forward bend.,
Extend your spine into standing half forward bend.,
Jump or step back into four limbed staff pose.,
Roll into upward facing dog.,
Finish in downward facing dog.,
Step forward into mountain pose.",How to Do Morning Yoga to Wake Up1," Start your sun salutation by standing in mountain pose. This sets you off in the flow of sun salutations.Keep your feet hip width apart. Your arms should be outstretched and at your sides. Look forward and make sure your balance is evenly distributed on each foot. #*Engage your abs and lightly curl your spine and bum toward the ground.
Breathe in and out evenly through your nose. You can make a slight sound like the sea as you breathe if you like. This may also help further wake you up and flow more easily through your sun salutations.;
, Inhale and bend your knees while raising your hands into chair pose. Arch your back slightly as you look up towards your hands. Keep your shoulders down and tilt your pelvis towards the floor.Extend your elbows completely. Keeping your hands in a prayer position as you reach towards the ceiling may make this easier.
Try and get your knees parallel to the floor by bending them deeply., From chair pose, you will progress to the next position in your sun salutation. Breathe out, engage your abs, and hinge forward into a forward bend.Keep your back as straight as possible while you hinge at your hips from chair pose to your forward bend.Place your palms flat on the floor next to either foot. You can bend your knees slightly if they don’t reach or you are not flexible enough yet to do a complete bend. You can also use blocks under your hands.
Point your hands and fingers forward so that your whole hand is pressing into the floor. This can make it easier to flow into the next positions in your wake up sun salutation.

, Breathe in gently as you lift your spine into a standing half forward bend. Remember to engage your abs and hinge at your hips as you lightly press up., The first very active movement in a sun salutation is called four limbed staff pose. This position looks like you’re hovering in a pushup position over the floor.Step back into the pose if you are new to yoga. If not, you can jump back to four-limbed staff pose.Keep your body as even as possible. Avoid sinking your hips or collapsing your core. Hold your arms close to your sides and form a 90 degree angle with your upper arms.

, From four legged staff pose, roll or set your toes into upward facing dog position. Gently arch your back, open your chest, and look up at the ceiling as the tops of your toes rest on the ground.This will allow you to flow into the next and final position, downward facing dog.Keep your palms fully pressing into the floor.Engage your thighs while you’re in upward dog. Pull your tailbone towards your heels to protect your back.

, From upward facing dog, roll back over or place your toes to transition into downward dog. Engage your abs and hinge at your waist so that your body makes an inverted “V” shape. This is downward facing dog, which is your final active pose.Recognize that your heels may not touch the floor. The more you often you do this pose, the easier it will be.
Lift your sitting bones towards the ceiling as you gaze at your navel.

, Once you’ve taken a few breaths in downward facing dog, end you sun salutations in mountain pose. Step your right foot forward and then your left until both feet are parallel. After this, engage your abs and hinge upward until you are standing straight with both arms at your sides. You can either move on to additional postures or finish your morning practice in savasana."

Increase your chances of defeating the bad guys in your diet.","How to Avoid Inflammatory, Common Toxic Foods and Excitotoxins"," You may often avoid inflammation and toxins. Only you know how your body reacts and feels to each type of food you feed it. Start by considering the worst offenders in ""your"" own modern diet. If you can isolate the foods that are likely causing you irritation and discomfort, you will be able to make better choices and control the quality of your diet, increasing your chances for healthy longevity. It is also important to discuss your concerns directly with your health professional. Some of the more common inflammatory culprits in the modern diet are explored in the remaining steps of this section.;
, These fats are unstable, broken foods that endanger the heart, clog blood vessels over time, and raise your bad cholesterol levels.Trans fats are created when edible oils are made into the ""trans"" state (across); this is done by bubbling hydrogen through hot oils (for certain degrees of hydrogenation) with a metal as catalyst. This processing trick slows their natural reaction with oxygen, preventing the natural rancid smells/and tastes that you'd normally experience with foods going off. As well as increasing the lifespan of any food made with the fats, this process keeps the fats more solid at room temperature, adding a deceptively ""fresh and creamy"" appeal to the food. Unfortunately, the trans fats are very unhealthy and contribute to inflammation.Trans fats are sometimes labeled as ""partially hydrogenated oil/fat"".

, Sugar may seem relatively harmless when compared with the artificial sweeteners. However, refined sugar reduces the function of your immune system and causes inflammatory reactions in your body (by increasing cytokines). Additional problems caused by sugar intake include:


Sugar causes advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that clog your brain and blur vision, causing such problems as diabetes, kidney disease and atherosclerosis.Sugar is responsible for much of the obesity in the industrialized world, especially through increased consumption of (totally nutrient-empty) sweet soda drinks and processed (over-refined) foods., Gluten intolerance may occur as a result of over-consuming refined grains. Adding more wholegrain products to your diet may help you to avoid gluten intolerance problems. (However, as with any such condition, do not self-diagnose gluten-intolerance; always get medical advice first.)


Some people believe that GMO grains are also increasing gluten intolerance.Do your own research before making up your mind on this possibility.

, These types of meat products often contain high amounts of sodium and often nitrites and/or nitrates, all of which are very inflammatory and are considered unhealthy. These meats may also contain additives, such as sugar and monosodium glutamate (MSG). The level of saturated fat is much higher in processed meats than in free-range or grass-fed unprocessed meats.


Feedlot-raised meats can have more inflammatory acids than grass-fed meat. For example, grass-fed beef is a good source of omega-3 essential fatty acids, whereas feedlot-raised beef tends to be higher in pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid.Avoid fat-soluble toxins that can build up in farmed, pond-raised fish. Look for wild- and sustainably-caught fish.

, Excitotocins refers to the artificial flavors, colors and other food additives often added to processed foods.These include mono-sodium glutamate (MSG), which can cause people sensitive to it to feel unwell, including having headaches and nausea. Excitotocins are used to improve the taste, texture, and visual appeal of packaged foods. If you want to live an anti-inflammatory lifestyle, don’t eat or drink anything that contains artificial sweeteners, flavorings or colors.


When eating out, ask for reassurance from any restaurant (Asian or otherwise) that no MSG has been used in food preparation.

, Foods to which you are personally allergic may be common ones that you haven't given much thought to before. Typical foods that can be the source of an allergy include: milk, egg whites, soy, chocolate or coffee. While some reactions involve headaches, nausea, stomachaches or itching, some reactions to food may be deadly, such as in the case of fish and shellfish, peanuts and tree nut allergies. Usually you will already be aware of such life-threatening allergies; however, all foods to which you are even slightly allergic have an inflammatory impact. It is best to have your doctor test you for precise food allergies, as many of the suggested self-tests are scientifically unreliable.Mango-fruit-skins ""equal"" poison ivy (Ouch!) - a poison in the skin of mangoes, urushiol. Urushiol the oil found in poison ivy that causes the rash and causes it to spread. Some people eat mango skin. They may see blisters appear on their lips and inside their mouth (and fearing herpes-fever-blisters, or worse!?), if allergic to poison ivy's poison. The pain and itch of poison ivy in your mouth!Wash mangoes thoroughly before peeling, being careful when peeling them. If you wish, wash the peeled mango fruit, using running water, to remove any urushiol that may have gotten on the fruit while peeling.



Expect to become allergic at any time, if you seem immune to mango skin, poison ivy and urushiol??? -- you can break out next! There may come a day when mango skin makes your mouth and esophagus fill with blisters. Play it safe and avoid that horrifying rash.

, Lactose sugar is among the most allergenic of all foods. Many people are sensitive to the sugars (lactose) in milk, known as lactose intolerance. Many more people are sensitive to casein, the main protein in milk. Many cannot tolerate products containing either casein or lactose, although this tendency is more prevalent in people from Asia, Africa and the Mediterranean area., Some foods, while safe in small doses or when cooked, can be harmful if not properly prepared or kept to small amounts. For example, the following foods can cause inflammatory reactions in susceptible people: raw green tomatoes; cooked or raw green/sprouting potatoes (never eat the leaves of rhubarb or the leaves and stems of tomatoes and potatoes as they are deadly toxic); raw almonds; raw beans; undercooked beans (or low-heat cooked), especially kidney beans; peach, apricot and cherry pits, and apple seeds all contain low level poisons that over time can build-up if you consume too many.Special warning: Nutmeg is a deliriant, such that too much causes poisoning and brain injury, hallucinogenic drug effects, consuming nutmeg at 2 grams has similar effect to low dose of amphetamines, but it takes several hours to digest and cause drug effects, unexpectedly., Acknowledging that drinking a little wine may offer some anti-inflammatory benefits,drinking too much alcohol is a primary trigger for inflammation and liver damage. All alcohol contains sugar, some more than others, and some alcohols are also artificially colored and flavored. If you don’t drink, don’t start. If you drink already, limit your consumption to 1 drink daily with food for no more than 4 drinks per week. Treat alcohol as a special occasion item but never binge drink; one or two drinks for a celebratory occasion is okay for most people.


Some people lack the ability to process alcohol. If this is your situation, don't harm your body by trying to overcome its natural intolerance.

, Discard foods listing trans fats on the ""Nutrition Facts"" food label and foods with hydrogenated- or partially hydrogenated-oil on the Ingredients labeling. Trans fats should not be eaten (eat them once or twice a year maybe). Trans fats foods often include the following food items, condiments, snacks and desserts:


Margarine, ""buttery"" spreads, really just flavored ""shortening""
Refried beans with grease, lard or shortening stirred in
Cookies and crackers
Cakes and icings
French fries and fried onion rings
Donuts and other such fried, white breads, all ""deadly"" but as delicious as cinnamon rolls and apple fritters, etc.

, If you're a baker, use natural flavorings and colorings that come from fruits and vegetables, such as lemons or beetroot. Use herbs, spices, small pinches of herbal salt and salt-reduced/sugar-free sauces to add flavors to your cooking. Use healthy virgin olive oil as a flavoring in its own right.


Many cordials and other ""just add water"" drinks contain high levels of artificial flavoring and coloring. These are very unhealthy and should be drunk sparingly.

, Barbecue may taste perfect, but half-burned fats are bad for anyone (such fats can trigger inflammation, tumors and cancers). Bad oils (often cheaper but deadly in the long run) cause imbalance in the anti-inflammatory enzymes in your body by adding too much omega-6 oil to your dietary balance. You need more omega-3 (ALA) oils, such as those derived from eating walnuts/pecans, flaxseed oil, macadamia nut oil and cooking with olive oil and grapeseed oil and from eating wild-caught, cold-water, ocean fish (EHA and some DHA).


Taking ""purified, concentrated"" high omega3, fish oil supplements can help you to achieve a balance between the various forms of fats, so as to not have too much omega-6 or EHA alone. Discuss this with your health professional first.
Always prefer oil in containers that are dark (non-see through) and from stores with a fast turnover. Discard oil after its use-by date, as it's likely turned rancid. Store oils in a cool, dry and dark place.

, Supplement your diet with probiotics (good bacteria), which can help to reduce inflammation but do be aware that probiotics are not a solve-all solution––they can help with some aspects of your gut health and inflammatory responses but not others, so do your research first."

The goal of ayurveda is to balance the body and mind to prevent disease. Ayurveda practitioners believe there are three main body energies (vata, pitta, and kapha) that cause disease when they become unbalanced. To balance the energies and treat illness, ayurveda uses:Stress relief like breathing exercises

Vegetarian diet
Meditation
Yoga
Body cleanses
Herbal medicines;
, TCM is another ancient alternative medicine that uses a variety of treatments to balance the life force or energy of the body. TCM practitioners believe illness is caused by major energy points becoming blocked. Specifically, disease is thought to be caused by your emotions, your environment, and your lifestyle (like your diet). To open energy points, restore balance, and treat illness, TCM uses:Herbal medicines

Acupuncture and acupressure
Nutrition
Moxibustion (burning herbs)
Massage

, This system of medicine is over 200 years old and its goal is to help the body heal itself. Homeopathy uses tiny doses of various substances like herbs, minerals, or animal products to help the body balance itself and cure disease.For example, studies have shown that taking small doses of local bee pollen can reduce allergy symptoms.Since the doses of substances are small, there are no side effects, making homeopathy a safe alternative medicine.In addition to trying to treat physical symptoms, homeopathy also tries to balance a person's emotional state and constitution.

, This alternative medicine relies on nature to treat illness. Naturopathic approaches try to support your body in healing itself and try to support you in making important lifestyle changes to improve your health. Education is main component of naturopathy. Other aspects of treatment include:Herbal medicines
Acupuncture and acupressure
Exercise
Lifestyle changes
Counseling

, This alternative medicine focuses on the power of the mind to heal the body. While there are several varieties and forms of mind-body medicine, they all strive to focus concentration on balancing health. Some forms of mind-body medicine include:Meditation, including mindfulness meditation

Prayer or spiritual development
Relaxation techniques, including deep breathing

Therapies, like art or music therapy
Energy medicine like reiki, qigong, and therapeutic touch

, Body-based alternative medicines focus on treating the structures of the body, like the skeletal system, muscles, and soft tissues. Most body-based therapies try to improve circulation and prevent disease. Types of body-based therapies include:Chiropractic medicine
Massage therapy
Alternative forms of body work

, Exercise programs such as tai chi are gaining popularity, especially among baby boomers, due to the fact that it combines body movements while minimizing stresses on the joints. Tai chi is an ancient Chinese exercise and martial art. However, the art form combines breathing exercises and meditation along with the physical movements., While anecdotal evidence may interest you in alternative medicines, you shouldn't rely on it as a trusted form of evidence. There are many variables that might be contributing to what works for one person but not for another. For example, some treatments may work better on someone who's young and healthy. Or, treatment may be less effective for someone with a certain genetic background.


For example, you might hear someone say, ""My friend tried this and it worked for her."" This anecdotal statement is not backed up by actual evidence.

, Clinical or scientific evidence follows the “scientific method” and controls for as many variables as possible. The goal with these studies is to determine what medicines work and under what conditions. Realize that sometimes it's difficult to control all variables, especially in clinical (human research) studies.


A placebo controlled double-blinded study is considered to be the best form of clinical evidence.With this type of study, some of the subjects get sugar pills (placebos) while other subjects get the treatment being studied. Neither the doctors nor the patients know which treatment they're getting.

, Most approaches to alternative medicine aren't tested by good scientific research. This can make it difficult to find good studies, especially since not much funding is available for alternative medicine research. This is largely because many scientific studies are funded by drug companies who wouldn't support alternative medicines. Also, some alternative medicines aren't easily tested using the scientific method. For example, there's no way to deliver placebo acupuncture. Other reasons why research is limited include:Different perspectives: For example, TCM has significantly different perspectives on how organs function and diseases are caused. These often don't match Western models of disease.
Difficulty patenting substances: Herbs and other natural substances often used in alternative medicine can't be patented, so it doesn't offer a financial incentive to study them.
Interest: Many scientists aren't committed to researching alternative medicines.

, Ask your doctor, nurse, or healthcare professional to recommend high-quality journals. The articles about alternative medicine should be peer-reviewed. This means that they were sent to independent experts for comment and criticism. You should also look for ""Impact Factor"" (IF). This shows how widely read, cited, and respected a journal is.Try to look for evidence from larger studies that have been repeated. You might read meta-analyses. These are papers that look at a group of studies on the same topic and analyse the data as a larger group than could be done for a single study.
Go to the NCCIH website at nccih.nih.gov/health. This page provides information on what science is saying about current complementary practices, in addition to providing resources to current objective sources of information.

, It's easy to misinterpret studies because you want to believe their claims. Or, maybe misinformation is all you can find because websites have copied and pasted inaccurate information. To check for misinformation or misinterpretation:Check the date: if the information is older, it may have changed. For example, there may be more evidence or older evidence may no longer be true.
Check for validation: see if the website has been checked for reliability by an organization like the Health on the Net (HON) Foundation.
Check the original references if you can: you can use PubNet to look for abstracts (article summaries) of the information in the articles. You can usually find a straightforward conclusion at the end of the abstract to summarize the main findings.
Double-check findings: look at a number of different websites. Make sure the content isn't word-for-word which could mean the information was copied and pasted from one site.
Check with your physician or another health care professional
Call alternative practitioners: ask what they think about one therapy or another. The practitioner is ethically obligated to be honest and truthful about any therapy.

, Question everything, especially when a practitioner claims to have a cure, revolutionary discovery, or ancient secrets. The practitioner should not give you a guarantee or limited offer. This should warn you not to trust the practitioner. You should also remember that because something is seen as natural, it doesn't make it safe.


Many plants contain poison or cause unwanted effects. Consider talking with several alternative practitioners like medical herbalists, naturopaths, and others to gauge the safety of natural products.
Understand that sometimes physicians and scientists try to use simplistic terms to educate, inform, and empower people since it's difficult to explain complex medical terms. These simple terms shouldn't be confused with with sales attempts.

, Many herbal products or supplements can interact with current diet or medication use. Just because something is described as being ""alternative"" or ""natural"" this does not mean it’s safe. If you are prescribed alternative dietary or herbal products, get a list of all the ingredients that are in it. You may want to consult with your physician or pharmacist regarding the ingredients and how they may interact with your current medication use.

, Since alternative medicine practitioners aren't required to complete standardized training and because laws and regulations can vary greatly from place to place, you should ask about the practitioner's training and experience. For example, you might ask:


Where did you train and how much training did you receive?
How much hands-on experience do you have?
Do you have formal training or certification?
Was your training done online or at a physical campus?

, Ask what education the practitioner has. Most naturopaths and chiropractors have doctorates awarded from a brick-and-mortar school of medicine. While this doesn't guarantee competence, it does show that the individual completed requirements and trained with licensed professionals.The level of education and certification may vary depending on the alternative medicine. For example, some require doctoral degrees in alternative medicine or a master's degree in nutrition.

, If you have a chronic condition or specific health concern, ask the practitioner what experience the practitioner has with it.You might find out what approaches were taken and how successful the patient found the treatment.


Be wary if a practitioner promises to cure your condition, especially if the practitioner can't give you any solid evidence to support this claim. Instead, look for someone who can heal or treat your health condition.

, Ask your doctor or local medical school to refer reputable alternative medicine practitioners. Once you've determined which alternative medicine you'd like to use, find a provider who is willing to work with your current healthcare team. You should also inform your other healthcare providers that you're working with an alternative medicine provider.You may want to check if your health insurance covers the alternative medicine provider. While it's not necessary, you will need to know what form of payment the practitioner accepts so that you're prepared for appointments.

",How to Administer a Coffee Enema," Administering a coffee enema can have adverse health risks, including colitis,septicemia,, and rectal burns due to the temperature of the coffee. There have even been reports of coffee-enema-related deaths., Despite holistic rumors a coffee enema is unlikely to have significant effects. The caffeine absorption from a coffee enema is far less than drinking coffee, and it has a negligible effect on blood pressure and heart rate.While limited use may not be harmful to every user, the benefits appear to be minimal.

, If you are considering a coffee enema, talk to your doctor about it first. It is likely that your physician will advise against the treatment, but she may be able to offer alternatives or to give you additional information about your prognosis. Other health and lifestyle changes may have a greater effect on your wellbeing with fewer risks.

, Since the theory behind the coffee enema has to do with the body’s response to caffeine, you should try drinking coffee instead of using an enema. You will absorb more caffeine by drinking the coffee without the other health risks of the enema., If you choose do do a coffee enema despite the fact that there are few likely health benefits and many possible risks, then do what you can to minimize the risks:


Cool the temperature to an appropriate temperature to avoid burns.
Keep equipment as sterile as possible.
Watch for signs of infection and seek medical attention immediately if you experience a fever after administering a coffee enema.
Do not discontinue other types of medical treatment in favor of this unproven alternative therapy.
Do not share the enema equipment with anyone.
Always wear vinyl or latex gloves when administering enemas.

, Boil less than 1 quart because you will add ice cubes later.


Use unchlorinated water to make the coffee because chlorine could kill the bacteria and germs your system needs to remain healthy.

, (24 grams) of ground, caffeinated coffee and boil for 5 minutes.

,, This will settle the coffee grounds to the bottom of the pan and cool the liquid.

, Strain the coffee into a container you will use only for enemas, as feces could get into the syringe when you refill the bulb for your second enema.

,, The bulb will suck in the coffee and should hold about 1 cup (236 ml) of coffee.

,, If you encounter any resistance, stop. Piercing a colon is no fun if you do pierce your colon seek medical attention immediately by calling your local Emergency Medical service immediately. In the USA, that number is 911.

,, Do not strain to hold the coffee. If you feel it necessary to move your bowels before 12 minutes pass do so.

,, Rinse thoroughly with warm, clean water.

, Loosen the clamp a bit; some coffee will run out. When the air is removed from the tubing, clamp the tubing closed again.

,,, If you feel fullness or discomfort, clamp the tubing closed immediately. Remove the nozzle when you finish releasing the coffee into yourself.

,,,,,, Ensure you remove the protective cover from the nozzle before you attempt to insert the nozzle.

Have the body prepared for the healing, by increasing the efficiency of the waste systems of the body before you begin to work on healing.,
Drink water.,
Check your diet.,
Check with the body's computer system to see if it is running at capacity before beginning to work on someone, and throughout healing sessions, to avoid overloading them.,
Learn Switchwords.",How to Avoid a Healing Crisis,"


There are two main waste systems in the body, the Lymphatic System and the Urinary System.

The Lymphatic System parallels the Circulatory System, but runs purely on water and muscle movement to propel it along its way. The Lymphatic System picks up waste from body cells. It is impaired when tight clothing is worn and by lack of movement. Exercise and movement substantially help the Lymphatic System with its job. Water is essential for the Lymphatic System to work properly. Drink plenty of water and move around to help work the Lymphatic System.
The Urinary System collects and excretes waste from the body. Water is the greatest key to allowing the Urinary System to remove poisons and toxins from the body. ""The solution to pollution is dilution."" If you are not drinking enough water, the Urinary System may be hampered in its ability to remove poisons, toxins and waste from the body.

;
, Having a person well hydrated before beginning to deal with healing may be a big key to avoiding a Healing Crisis.

, Another key to getting the body ready to deal with healing is making sure it is getting plenty of protein, and not being overrun with sugar, processed carbs and grains. It may be wise to check up on a person's diet and make sure they are eating plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables and proteins, and not eating a lot of fast food, prepackaged foods, sugars and grains for at least a week or two before starting into deep healing.

,


One way to check with the body's computer system is simply to use Reflex Muscle Testing and ask the body each time you complete a technique if it is okay to continue. A weak muscle when you ask, ""Can I continue to work with this body?"" means it is time to stop now. Ask the body to save the work and when would be a good time to continue.
Another tell-tale sign that the body is at or beyond capacity is when Reflex Muscle Testing gives the same result for Yes and No. Often the body will give weakness on both if the body is full, but sometimes it will show strong on both. If you ever get an unexpected answer on Reflex Muscle Testing, check two questions with known answers, one yes and one no, to verify if the body is going beyond capacity. If it is getting overfilled, you will get an incorrect answer on one of them. If this happens, ask the body to save the work and stop immediately.

, There are a few Switchword phrases that may help alleviate a healing crisis.


The Switchphrase ""DIVINE-LIGHT-FLOW"" may be helpful for brightly focusing positivity and stepping out of routine, allowing flow. When one deals with illness and disease, generally it relates to negative emotions and ways of being, one must allow oneself to flow in another direction to release the illness or disease.
The Switchphrase ""OPEN-GO-BE"" may be useful for releasing and allowing things to progress and return to health and peace.
The Switchphrase ""CRYSTAL-ALONE-BE"" may be useful for connecting to the healing path and opening to healing.

Tilt like a cat.,
Lunge into Warrior One.,
Balance in tree pose.,
Twist away tension.,
Recharge in corpse pose, or savasana.",How to Do Morning Yoga to Wake Up2," If you have some more time to commit to doing some morning yoga, you can add a few more poses to help wake yourself up.

Sit on a folded blanket or extend one leg if this is uncomfortable.
Place your left hand on your right knee, breathe in and then breathe out as you twist to the right. Inhale, return your body to the starting positions, and repeat on the other side.

, Stretching your spine can also help you wake up with yoga. Get onto all fours and lengthen your spine. Reach the crown of your head toward the wall in front of you and your tailbone toward the wall behind you. Breathe in deeply and exhale as you round your back up toward the ceiling and draw your chin toward your belly. Arch your back as you inhale. Then drop your belly toward the floor as you lift your sitting bones and chest. This should invigorate and relax you.Keep your wrists under your shoulders. Your knees should rest under your hips.
Repeat this sequence three times.

, Your legs and back can take a beating during the day. Adding Warrior One, which is like a high lunge, can strengthen and stretch your lower back, legs, and hips.Stand up straight and then step forward about a leg’s distance into a high lunge. Turn in your left foot slightly for added support. Raise your arms directly above your head and look past your fingers.
Keep your knee and ankle in one direct line. Drop your left knee to the ground if standing in the lunge is too difficult for you. You’ll get the same benefits and minimize the risk of injury.
Step your left leg forward to meet the right. Repeat the pose on your left leg.

, If you’re looking to gain balance and help concentrate your mind in the morning, try tree pose.

Repeat by shifting your weight onto your right foot and placing your left foot on your right inner thigh.
Place your foot on your calf muscle or ankle if you feel a bit wobbly doing the full posture. Avoid placing your foot on your knee, which can protect it and your standing leg., Mornings are often hectic for some people, while others may feel tense because of work, school, or other obligations. Doing a seated twist is a great way to ring out tension in your body and help you calm down for the day ahead.Sit upright with your legs stretched out in front of you. Bend your knees with both feet on the floor. Slide your left foot under your right so that it grazes your right hip. Make sure that both your sitting bones remain on the floor to get the most out of your twist.
Twist your upper body toward the right. If you can, place your left elbow on your right knee to help yourself get deeper into the twist. Make sure your back is straight and your shoulders parallel to one another.

, End your morning yoga with savasana, or corpse pose. Savasana helps further calm and relax you. It also can further open your chest and release tight shoulders. Lie on the floor with your feel hip width apart, your arms slightly out to the side, and your eyes closed. Close your eyes and breathe naturally for as long as your like.#*Put your legs up the wall if savasana hurts your back or feels uncomfortable. This can help your legs relax better than if they are on the ground. It may also be more appropriate if you have lower back issues."

Set an intention.,
End with a meditation.,
Set a soothing alarm.,
Get your gear ready the evening before your practice.",How to Do Morning Yoga to Wake Up3," Good yoga starts with an intention. Take a few seconds to close your eyes before your sun salutation..

Plan to do strength training.",How to Add Tai Chi to Your Workout," Yang and Wu styles of tai chi are probably the most popular forms of tai chi. The Wu style is a variant of the Yang style. In addition, they're the most commonly practiced forms of tai chi worldwide.These styles use wide slow flowing movements which make them the best styles for beginners.Yang and Wu styles are also great for helping those overcome tension or stress in their lives. Both use meditation as part of the practice
Because both Yang and Wu styles are so popular, the majority of classes, DVDS and videos will incorporate these two styles of tai chi most frequently.;
, This is a more active form of tai chi and may not be for everyone. It doesn't necessarily fall into the slow, gentle flowing movements of some tai chi practices.


The Chen style of tai chi uses some explosive and fast moves - like jump kicks.This may be out of the fitness range of some people.
If you're already fairly fit or athletically inclined (or looking for a more exciting form of tai chi) consider the Chen style.
The Chen style uses wide, expansive movements that can be hard on the knees and lower back. Be careful when performing this style., Tai chi is an easy type of exercise to do. However, it's very different from any other more traditional forms of activity. It's important to meet with a trained teacher, if possible, so you know how to do tai chi correctly.A tai chi teacher will be able to guide you during a class or individual session. They can teach you how to breath and use your breathing to promote calmness.
A good way to find a decent teacher is by talking to that teacher's students but also speaking to the teacher yourself.Ask about the classes, the personality of the teacher, and how the classes are conducted.
Although it's important to learn correct form and how to maximize the benefits of tai chi, if you cannot afford to take a tai chi class or cannot find one, you have very little risk of injury or other adverse effects by doing this exercises yourself.

, Since tai chi isn't a overly popular form of exercise, you might have some difficulty finding a local teacher or class. However, tai chi is easy enough that you can do it in your own home.


There are many tai chi videos and DVDs that you can purchase so you can perform this exercise in the privacy of your own home.
When purchasing your DVD decide whether or not you should be purchasing one for beginners, pregnant women, older adults or those with special health problems. Many tai chi practices are designed for a very specific condition.
There are also many tai chi videos online. You can download many videos or go to websites for live streaming. This may be a good option if you don't want to settle only one DVD.

, Many forms of exercise require specialty equipment or clothing. Tai chi doesn't require specialty clothing, however tai chi teachers do recommend the following:


Wear clothing that allows you to comfortably flow through the series of movements. Do not wear restrictive clothing that feels tight or prohibits a full range of motion.Yoga pants, running shorts and other more traditional exercise clothing is permitted.
Wear comfortable, flat bottomed shoes or go barefoot. Whatever works for you.Avoid wearing jewelry or watches as they may interfere with some of the movements done with partners., Once you've gotten into a routine of doing tai chi or have found that you enjoy this practice, set yourself up for doing at least 20 minutes of practice per session.It's typically recommended to do at least 20 minutes of practice as it is believed that this allows your blood to flow through your entire body in this time period. This is an essential part of tai chi practice.It is also believed that it takes 20 minutes for your body to be fully warmed up and have increased blood flow to all your muscles. It is thought that this is responsible for the ""good or happy feelings"" many practitioners experience at the end of a tai chi workout., Like any new exercise routine, it can take a few tries to get the moves and routine down. Be patient with yourself as you experience and try out this new alternative form of exercise.


Although tai chi isn't considered a difficult or high-intensity physical activity, it is something very different from most traditional forms of exercise. Be patient with yourself as you grow and learn in your practice.In addition, it may take time for you to get the breathing down and be able to quietly meditate as you move through the movements. This also takes time and practice.
It's recommended to set a regular time each day to practice so you become more proficient in this relaxing form of exercise., Like many forms of exercise, a warm-up is recommended prior to starting a tai chi routine. It helps prepare your body for the exercise ahead.


Start your warm up by get the blood flowing to your muscles and joints. You can: go for a short walk, do a self massage by rubbing your hands together followed by your legs, feet, lower back and shoulders, or gently shaking your arms and legs to loosen up your joints.Progress to doing a few stretching exercises. It's important to do each stretching exercise about 3-5 times. Also only stretch to 70% of your range.Stretching exercises to use include: head and neck roll, shoulder roll, spine stretch, forward stretch and side stretch.

, Many tai chi workouts start with the infinity pose. This position focuses on posture awareness and correct form during this and all other tai chi moves.Stand with feet hip width apart and your arms hanging loosely at your sides. Keep your eyes closed and try to focus on the posture of your body.
Tuck your chin in towards your chest slightly. Your neck should be relaxed. Keep your shoulders back and pulled down.
Keep your knees soft and relaxed - do not lock your knees. Focus on your breathing and bring awareness to your posture.
Maintain this position for a few minutes before moving forward with other tai chi exercises.

, This is a classic stress relieving pose in tai chi. It's very simple and can be done by most healthy adults without difficulty. Incorporate this pose to help relieve any stress from your day.Stand with feet hip width apart with your feet facing forward. Slightly lean your body to the right with your right foot supporting more of your body weight. Hold this position for a few seconds.
Slowly begin to re-center your weight equally on both feet. Then, flow over to the left side and support most of your body weight on your left foot. Again, hold for a few seconds.
Flow between the left and right sides of your body for 2-3 minutes.

, This particular exercise helps to promote increased flexibility and opening of the spine. This is a great exercise to start your tai chi workout.Stand with your feet slightly wider than shoulder width apart. Keep your feet facing forward and parallel to each other. Let your hands and arms hang loosely at your sides.
Start by spreading your fingers wide apart on each hand. Inhale, and sweep your arms out to the side and up towards the ceiling. Stop once your fingers and arms are pointing straight up.
Exhale and bend over allowing your torso and head to roll down towards the floor. Allow your arms to hang loosely towards the ground.
Inhale and gently roll your spine back up into the starting position. Repeat a few times until you're feeling warmed up.

, Similar to yoga, tai chi workouts end with a specific posture - called the closing posture. This helps end your workout and helps calm your body down.Start by standing with your feet hip width apart and your feet facing forward.
Relax your shoulders, but bring your hands up to belly level and cup your hands together (as if you were cupping water).
Close your eyes and inhale while bringing your cupped hands up to chest level.
While exhaling, flip your hands so your palms are facing the ground and ""push"" your hands down to the level of your lower abdomen.
Repeat the ""pushing"" up and down a few times until you feel completely relaxed and still.

, Incorporating tai chi into your workout routine is a great way to add in an activity that can help relax and calm you. However, its advised to continue with other forms of exercise as well.


Tai chi is not considered an aerobic form of exercise. You should still perform cardiovascular activities that increase your heart rate level more than a typical tai chi workout.
Cardiovascular exercises come with a host of health benefits as well. It helps improve mood, improve circulation, maintain a healthy weight and decrease your risk of stroke, heart disease, type two diabetes and high blood pressure.Aim to include about 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio exercises each week in addition to your tai chi. Try: walking, jogging, swimming, dancing, using the elliptical or going hiking., Baseline or lifestyle activity is also important to focus on to help you maintain a healthy and active lifestyle.


Baseline activities are those activities you do on a regular basis as part of your daily routine. Mopping the floors, walking to get the mail, or going up stairs to your office all count as baseline or lifestyle activity.Many studies show that baseline activity offers similar benefits to structured aerobic exercises.Try to maintain or increase the amount of lifestyle activity you typically do. Try parking farther away, taking the stairs more often or getting up and walking on your lunch break.

, Including rest days is another important component of your exercise routine. If you do not include enough rest days, you can experience some negative side effects.


Over training or just doing too much may end up causing some issues. You can experience a weight loss plateau (if you're attempting weight loss), could make you feel fatigued or tired more often, and prevent proper recovery and repair of your muscles.It's typically recommended to take about 1 or 2 rest days a week. However, your rest days shouldn't be ""lay on the couch"" day either. Try to be active on your rest days as well.
Tai chi is a great exercise for your rest day. It's low impact, low intensity and can still allow your body to heal and recover from more intense workouts. Plus it focuses on calmness and flexibility which is great for a day off.

, Like aerobic activity, you should include other forms of strength and resistance training in addition to your tai chi workout.


Tai chi does help improve muscle definition and tone, but again isn't considered to be a significant source of resistance training. A combination of both tai chi and more traditional strength training is the best combination.
Strength training helps build strength and muscle, however it helps reduce your risk of osteoporosis, increases your metabolism and helps prevent falls as you age.Aim to include at least 1 day of strength training each week in addition to your tai chi workout.You can lift free weights, use weight machines or try pilates.

All you can do in life is to try your best and then let fate take its course. If you can't affect the outcome then there is no point in worrying about something.


This is tough to do, of course, and will take some practice.
Mostly you just need to remind yourself to let go, but you can also do exercises by distracting yourself with other tasks while you wait out the thing that's making you upset.
Remember that the behavior of other people is one of the biggest things that is outside of our control.;
, When other people make us angry, it is usually because we cannot understand why they're doing something that's making us angry. Instead of blowing up at someone or stressing yourself out, try to see things from their side of the table. Think about why they did what they did...and remember that we're all people with our own problems and our own dreams.


For example, your husband may drive you crazy when he forgets to do the dishes. However, he doesn't forget them to be mean to you....forgetfulness is probably just a part of who he is, just like how you snore.

, A huge source of worry in our lives comes from when we beat ourselves up. We really can be our own worst bully. Maybe you feel bad about forgetting to write a paper or maybe you're worried you said the wrong thing to your friend. No matter what you did, it's important to remember that you can't go back in time. Beating yourself up over something you can't change won't make things any better. All you can do is work to make the future better and improve yourself with time...which is something that everyone has to do.


Remember, to err is human!

, Just like you have to forgive yourself, you have to forgive other people too. For most of the same reasons even! Remember: this means truly forgiving them. Don't be passive aggressive or find ways to punish them later. Just let it go and find ways to work better together in the future!

, Everything is temporary in life. The only things that are eternal are the rising and setting of the sun. You have to remember this in all things that you do. Embrace the things you love and enjoy them while you can. Wait for the passing of difficult times. When we die, we don't take any of these trappings of life with us, so make sure that it's your soul that's fulfilled and let the rest of it just go however fate feels like going.

, When we try to be someone that we're not, it adds tons of stress, guilt, and unhappiness to our lives. We can hope all we want to be a different person than we are, but that's not really how people work! You just have to be yourself and embrace the person that you are.


Don't worry about what other people say or what they want you to be. It's not their life: it's yours.

, Life is all about getting to do things that bring you joy. When you live life really well, you perfectly balance doing the hard stuff, the fun stuff, and the stuff that helps others. Of course, some of us tend to focus too much on the hard stuff or we forget to take time out for ourselves. You have to pursue the things that make you happy, regardless of what other people think, or you will never feel fulfilled.

, Sometimes you need quiet time to focus on your own problems and decompress. It can be hard, in the loud mess that is life, to find time for this but it is very important for your own happiness and ability to handle the tough stuff in life.


Try taking a weekend away at the library to read and relax.
Sit alone for lunch sometimes to get away from the drama.

, Helping others is one of the most powerful things we can do to give ourselves a sense of fulfillment and peace. Helping others give us a purpose and lets us feel like we accomplished something great. If you find that nothing else in life is giving you a sense of peace, try helping people in serious need.


You can volunteer at a local soup kitchen or at your local community center, tutoring for adult literacy classes.

, Having a goal that you can work for can really help when you're feeling lost and aimless. Really, what's the point in life if you don't have something to work towards, right? Find something that you want for yourself and then figure out what you have to do to pursue it. You'll find a zen-like peace when you're working with all your soul devoted to a single goal.


Have you always wanted to learn how to play the piano maybe?
Maybe what you really want to do is have a child?

, Music can help us calm down and find inner peace even in the most stressful of situations. Find music that works for you and then be ready to rock it at a moment's notice!


One good chillout song is Ze Frank's ""Chillout"". What a surprise!
MyNoise is another great source of relaxing music that can help you center yourself and find some inner peace.

, Going for a walk or run is another good way to calm yourself down. Getting exercise not only tires us out and lets us release tension, it also releases endorphins, which are the brain chemical that regulates our emotions. Go for a quick jog around the block if you find you're having a hard time.

, Whether you're playing fetch with a dog or pirates with a five-year-old, having fun with someone who really knows how to embrace the joys of life can make a huge difference when you're having a tough time.

, Drama, either drama you cause or drama you find yourself in the middle of, can really get in the way of finding your inner peace. We tend to seek out drama because it makes like more exciting, but in order to find peace we have to make our lives more exciting by pursuing challenges instead. This is because the negative feelings associated with drama cannot create inner peace, which relies on positive feelings.


If someone in your life is prone to just bringing the drama, try to cut them out as much as you can.

, There are lots of great, basic comfort activities that you can do to calm down and find peace when you're starting to get a bit on edge. You can drink tea, watch a funny movie, meditate, light some incense, or any number of other calming rituals. These work based on personal preference, so just find one that works for you!

, The Stoics were ancient philosophers who were pretty much the experts at being at peace. It is the whole point of their philosophy! Read up on the Stoic philosophy and the lives of the Stoic philosophers and see how you can apply their lessons to your own life.


A Guide to the Good Life, by William B Irvine, is a great modern primer on Stoic philosophy.

, Holy texts, whether we're talking about the Bible or the Quran, can all teach us how to find peace by living more fulfilling lives. Even if you're not a religious person, there's plenty of wisdom to be found in the holy texts of cultures all over the world. You will find that almost all of them teach the same ideals!

, Spiritual advisers, such as priests and monks, can also help advise you on how to find inner peace. Even if you don't want a religious solution, they are experts in the soul and human mind and should be able to help you find productive, inspiring ways to improve your experience of life.

, Go sit out in a natural area nearby. Listen to the trees. Watch the animals. Do they seem worried about what their brother did last Christmas? Do the trees seem to notice when it starts to rain? No. Nature adapts and embraces every twist and turn in life and you should too.

, There are a number of books and works by people who have really mastered this peace thing. Seek out some books that deal with the issues that cause you tension or go with some of the classics. Some authors that are known for the significant contributions to philosophy on this issue include:


Joseph Campbell

Do the cow face pose.,
Do the chair pose.,
Do the king dancer pose.",How to Do Chest Exercises in Yoga2," The name of this exercise has nothing to do with its execution; simply sit down with one leg over the other and reach your arm up towards the ceiling to effectively lengthen the muscles in your back. Make sure you focus on finding a center of balance in your chest, not your back, to maximize chest strengthening.

, You might find this one challenging, particularly if you have poor balance, but after completing this workout a few times you'll be able to do it perfectly. This pose is also called ""awkward pose"" because it can be a difficult stretch, but by elongating your arms, you can find your center of balance easily. Complete this pose three times: once with your feet planted firmly on the ground, once with your heels just slightly off the ground, and once with your heels elevated 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) off the ground.

, Another balance-dependent pose, this one will relieve anxiety and increase lung capacity. If you struggle to keep your balance, remember to keep pushing your foot into the palm of your hand. The more you push, the better you will be able to keep poised and also the better the stretch. While the goal of this pose is to lift your toes above your head, if this complete stretch is not in your practice, just elevate your foot as much as possible, focusing on keeping a continuous arch.

Do the bow pose.,

, As you complete this pose, focus on keeping your elbow against your knee. Push into your knee with your elbow to find your center of balance. For a slightly more challenging version of the triangle pose, try out the revolved triangle pose (which is also in yoga).

Yin Yoga is considered “passive,” meaning that poses are typically seated or supine (on your back), and they are held for 3-5 minutes., Yin Yoga involves holding poses for 3-5 minutes, which is likely to cause some discomfort. If you experience discomfort, try not to immediately exit the pose. Instead, try to sit with it for at least one minute.

Come up slowly.",How to Do a Yoga Camel Pose," If you are new to yoga, be sure to talk to your doctor before you begin a yoga practice to learn if there are any poses you should avoid.


Be especially careful with camel pose if you have any problems with your back, neck, or knees, if you are pregnant, if your blood pressure is abnormally high or low, if you suffer from insomnia or headaches, or if you have recently had surgery.;
, Be sure to wear comfortable clothing that will not inhibit your movement. You should also make sure that you have plenty of room to lay your yoga mat out and to stretch. If you are practicing on your own, find a quiet place that is as free from distractions as possible.


In addition to a yoga mat, you may want to have two yoga blocks available for this pose.

, Before attempting camel pose, be sure to stretch your back with some gentler poses.If you are attending a class, your instructor will not have you do camel pose until you are sufficiently warmed up. If you are practicing on your own, try some poses like cat cow pose and cobra pose to warm up your spine.

, Especially if you are new to yoga, you may not be able to do the full extension of this pose. Start out doing as much as you are comfortable with, and work up to the full pose slowly. You should never feel pain during yoga, so be sure to listen to your body and lessen the intensity of your pose if you begin to feel strained.

, To come into camel pose, kneel on your mat and place both hands on your hips. Your knees should be the same distance apart from each other as your hips, and your legs should be parallel. Tuck your chin in slightly, and then try to lengthen your tailbone towards the floor.Depending on the modification you choose, the tops of your feet can be flat on the floor or your toes can be tucked under.

, If you have never done this pose before, start with a less intense modification. Begin by gently tilting your pelvis forward. You can then begin arching your upper back and drawing your shoulder blades towards each other to open your chest. Leave your hands on your hips or move them to your sacrum (just above your tailbone) for some extra support.If you feel comfortable here, feel free to explore some of the other options. It is also perfectly fine to stay in this modified pose. If you feel any compression in your back, reduce the intensity of the back bend.

, The next step is to reach back with both arms to touch your heels with your hands. Keeping your toes tucked under is a great modification that can help make this pose a little easier to achieve.You should aim to grab your heels with your palms so that your fingers are pointing towards the floor. If you can't quite reach your heels, but you want to get a deeper stretch than you would by keeping your hands on your hips, place yoga blocks next to your feet and reach for those instead.
At this point, you can release your head back and gaze at the ceiling or the wall behind you, but only if this feels good for your neck.

, The only difference between the full extension of the pose and the modification in which you keep your toes tucked is that the tops of your feet will be flat on the floor. Reach back with both arms, grab your heels, and release your head, just as you would for the modification.

, If the full extension of camel pose is easy for you, you can intensify the stretch a bit. Remember to work within your limits and not push yourself too hard.


Instead of reaching straight back for your heels, cross your arms behind you and grab for opposite heels.Challenge your balance by reaching one arm up while in camel pose, and then switching arms.If you can reach your hands further than your heels, try bringing your palms flat on the floor next to your feet.

, If it feels comfortable, you may stay in the position for a little longer. If you are beginning to feel strained, come out of the position right away.

, Remember to take just as much care coming out of the pose as you did getting into it. Coming out of camel pose too abruptly may increase your risk of injury.

, Tuck your chin and place your hands on your hips before beginning to come out of the pose.

, Push your hips towards the floor and roll your spine back to its upright position gently, starting with your lowest vertebra and ending with your neck."

Make sure your back is neutral and your tailbone is tucked in., When you exhale, move your awareness to your fingertips and gently reach out toward the walls. Keep your shoulders relaxed and rolled back, with your shoulder blades tucked alongside your spine., As you inhale, think of lifting the crown of your head up toward the ceiling.

For ease, this tutorial will focus on having your right foot on the ground, but you can easily reverse the directions if you would rather learn left-footed. Gradually begin to shift all of your weight into your right foot so that you can move your left foot freely.









Keep your toes free, spreading them widely for balance. You should be able to wiggle them a bit throughout the exercise.;
, You should, however, keep your chin up so that it is parallel to the floor. With your eyes open, fix your gaze on a stationary object a few feet in front of you. This object, called a drishti in yoga, will help you maintain your focus and stay balanced.








Some people like looking straight ahead, others at a spot on the floor. Experiment with what works for you.

, Keeping your right leg strong, slowly lift your left toes off the ground. Bend your knee so that it forms a 90-degree angle.








, It doesn't matter where you put it just yet. Simply place your left foot on your leg, making sure your toes point to the floor. If you're not flexible, you can place your foot right above the ankle. If you are flexible, use your hands to pull your foot as high up your thigh as comfortable. The higher you can get it, the better.








Your left knee should be pointing directly to your side, towards the wall.
Make sure you can still balance on your right foot as you position the left.

, Your hips should be level with one another and facing towards the front of the room. Once you have confirmed that your hips are level, start working to actively pull your left knee back to open your left hip as wide as possible.









If you need to use your left hand to help you push your left knee back, do so.
It's okay not to get the hips fully open at first-- as you stretch you'll get more flexible.

, Press your palms together in prayer position in front of your chest. If it is too difficult to balance, place your hands on your hips or extend them out to either side.







, In order to steady yourself, push your left foot against your right thigh while simultaneously pushing your right thigh against your left foot. Do this throughout the duration of the pose. This keeps your pose correct, your legs strong, and your body on balance.







, Point your tailbone towards the floor, pull your bellybutton towards your spine, and lower your shoulders to create length in your spine. Think about creating a little bit of space between each vertebrae. Each time you inhale, try to feel your spine slowly elongating, even if only barely.







, On an inhale slowly lift your arms up over your head. Keep your palms together until they are over your head, hen separate them. Your palms should face each other and your arms should extend completely. Your hands are roughly shoulder-width apart.








If you are able to, open up your chest by squeezing your shoulder blades together.
If you are already struggling to keep your balance, focus on your lower body before complicating things with your hands.

, Remember to keep breathing and keep gazing at your drishti. As you hold, think about:









Gentle, regular breaths.
Elongated spine, with shoulders back.
Hips open, with your left knee facing out.
Leg and foot pressing slightly together.

, Begin by lowering your arms back to your chest.Then release your foot from your thigh, rotate your left hip forward, straighten your left leg, and release your left foot to the floor. Use your hands to guide your foot down slowly if needed.








, Stand next to the wall or hold on to the back of a chair to help you keep your balance. This will allow you get all the benefits of the pose while also working to improve your balance.







, If lifting your foot all the way to your opposite thigh is challenging, work on the pose by lifting your foot as high as you can. You can place your foot on the inside of your opposite calf, or even keep the tips of your toes on the floor and rest your foot against your opposite ankle.








It's fine to place your foot anywhere on your opposite thigh or calf, but never put it directly on your knee.

, For a more advanced version of this exercise, begin holding the pose for longer periods.








, If you're feeling very balanced in this pose, try closing your eyes. You might be surprised by how challenging it becomes to stay balanced without any visual cues.







, Another way to challenge your balance is to begin moving your arms from side to side above your head, as if the branches of your tree were blowing in the wind. Keep your lower body perfectly still.








, Tree pose is contraindicated for people who are experiencing headaches, dizziness, and low blood pressure.








If you have high blood pressure, you can still perform tree pose, but you should avoid raising your arms above your head.
Use caution if you have any problems with your hips or knees. If you feel any pain in your joints when performing tree pose, come out of it right away.If you're brand-new to yoga, talk to your doctor to learn if you are healthy enough for yoga and if there are any poses you should avoid.

, Tree pose requires lots of flexibility in the hip, so you will want to make sure that your pants do not inhibit your movement in any way. You should also avoid pants that are too loose or made of a slippery material because your foot will be resting against the inside of your opposite thigh.








, Find a quiet, comfortable space where you will be able to practice yoga without any distractions. A yoga mat is not necessary for this pose, but if you plan on performing other poses as well, you may want to have one.









If possible, find a space where no one will be walking or standing in front of you. Watching someone else moving or attempting to balance in tree pose may make it more difficult for you to maintain your balance.
Some people actually find it easier to balance in tree pose when they are standing on the hard floor instead of on a yoga mat. Do whatever makes you feel most comfortable.

, Your spine should be straight and your feet should be aligned with your outer hips. Keep your hands by your sides.

Preparing yourself for other standing poses in yoga.
Identifying imbalances in your body, which can cause muscular and postural discrepancies. This means that your body may be overcompensating in one area when another area is weak.

, While it may seem like you’re just standing when you’re in Mountain Pose, your body is actually very active, engaging different parts of your body.

Reach up with both arms, extending them away from your body. Turn your palms inwards to face each other. You’ll feel a stretch along your torso’s sides.

, Try bringing your arms in front of you. Keep your arms even with each other. Interlace your fingers and pull your hands away from your body. You should feel a gentle stretch in your shoulder blades.

, Once you have mastered the Mountain Pose with your eyes fixed on a single focal point, try the pose with your eyes closed.By closing your eyes, your body must work that much harder to maintain balance.

Try to pull the towel up so that your lower hand's shoulder reaches up, then pull down. Switch sides so that each arm gets to be the top hand and the bottom hand.
Hold each stretch for as long as you comfortably can. A good rule of thumb is to hold stretches for 15 seconds and aim for two to four repetitions., Your glutes will likewise get a workout during chair pose.

Cross your right leg.,
Breathe deeply.,
Fold forward.,
Repeat with the other leg.",How to Do a Seated Figure Four1," To do any seated yoga variation, you must be sitting in a solid, stable chair that allows you to place both of your feet firmly on the floor. Chairs with wheels or with a lot of cushioning in the seat typically aren't the best choices.Sit forward on the edge of your chair and make sure your back is neutral, not arched. You should be sitting on your ""sit bones"" – two points you'll be able to feel on your buttocks – not on your tailbone.
Roll your shoulders back so that your shoulder blades are tucked in and flowing straight down your back alongside your spine.;
, Before you get started with the seated figure four, it's a good idea to do some neck stretches and twists to gently open up your neck and back. These are especially important if you're stiff from sitting hunched over a computer for an extended period of time.Simple neck and shoulder rolls will help loosen you up and improve your mobility. While not technically yoga poses or exercises, they can help warm you up for the seated figure four as well as other seated yoga poses.

, Breathing is at the center of yoga practice. Turn your focus to your breath and inhale deeply through your nose, expanding your belly. Think of filling your lungs with air from the bottom up.When your lungs are completely full, pause for a moment before exhaling slowly out of your mouth. Open your throat so you are making a whispered ""ha"" sound in the back of your throat as you exhale. With practice, you'll be able to make this sound while exhaling through your nose.
When you've completely exhaled, pause before inhaling again. These pauses between inhaling and exhaling help your breathing become more intentional.
Hold the pose for 10 to 20 breaths, or as long as you can do so comfortably. Since this is a gentle pose, you can hold it as long as you want – just keep in mind that you need to switch and do the other side.

, If you want to intensify the stretch in your glutes and outer thighs, you can do so by hinging your torso forward from the waist. Try to keep your back as flat and neutral as possible, and don't crunch your shoulders.Think about folding your chest or heart toward your thighs. You can rest your torso on your thighs if it's comfortable for you to fold that deeply, but don't go any further than you can without pain or discomfort.

, Any time you're doing one-sided yoga poses, you need to make sure you're doing the same pose on both sides to prevent imbalances. Lower your right foot to the floor, then lift your left foot and repeat the same movements."

Even if it is dark out, going outside is more likely to wake you up than staying indoors. The combination of fresh air, exercise, and changing the environment are all signals to your brain to wake up.;
, Though natural light is the best, any increase in light can be a shot to your senses and give you a “wake up” surge. Bright light signals to the brain to awaken. If you are unable to access natural light, blue light that is present in LED screens has also showed benefits to wakefulness. Many people find florescent lights draining, especially low-quality or ""industrial"" type of lighting. It is still better than no light, or dim light, but other lighting types (LED, incandescent, halogen) may be better.

, Although the light in screens can keep you awake, your TV or computer can lead to both visual and mental fatigue. In addition, these electronic devices are typically done while sitting for long periods. This in turn leads to a groggy, logy, restless feeling.


Try stretching your vision by looking at things close up and then far away, alternating very quickly. Also try looking at far-away objects, whether it is gazing at the city skyline, seeing if there is snow on the mountains, or checking for boats on the ocean.

, Pumping up the volume on your favorite jams and singing along will help you feel more awake. You may need to use headphones if you are in an office setting or if there are other people around. Be sure to select songs that are upbeat and peppy.
Get a bonus energy surge by dancing along with the music.

, Colder rooms are more likely to make you feel alert. Working in an environment that is hot and stuffy can make you feel like you need to nap. Turn down the thermostat and open a window if it is cool outside. If it is a hot day, try turning on a fan and the air conditioning if applicable. "

Strengthen your mid back.,
Make your thoracic spine more flexible.,
Stretch your chest and neck muscles.,
See a chiropractor.,
Avoid poor posture.,
Deal with shoulder injuries properly.,
Ask your doctor if you have scoliosis.,
Try to prevent osteoporosis.",How to Align Your Shoulders," Part of being able to pull back your shoulders and keep them properly aligned is having strong muscles in your mid back region between your shoulder blades. The main muscles groups there are called the paraspinals, rhomboids, trapezius and infraspinatus.When these muscles are too weak, they allow the shoulders to slouch forward. When they're strong, it's easier to hold and maintain good posture.


Rowing machines are excellent for building strength in the muscles between your shoulder blades. Start with light weights and lower reps and slowly progress to heavier weight and more reps over the course of four to six weeks.
Doing the ""reverse fly"" with free weights is also great for strengthening the rhomboids and trapezius muscles. Sit on the edge of a bench with your waist bent forward and looking at the floor. Grab dumbbells in each hand and lift them laterally out and up off the floor, causing your shoulder blades to retract. When your arms are parallel with the floor, hold for a few seconds then slowly lower the dumbbells.
Swimming is an excellent exercise because it works virtually all your muscles, especially those of your shoulders, spine and legs. Swimming also forces you to have good posture in order to stay above the water line and swim in a straight line.;
, Although your thoracic spine (mid back) naturally curves forward somewhat, too much slouching can create a hump that's stiff and painful.The inflexible hump (medically called a kyphosis) then forces the shoulders and neck forward. As such, try to make your thoracic spine more flexible by extending it (reversing the curve) so that it's easier to realign your shoulders.


Lay on a large exercise ball with your feet on the floor and looking up at the ceiling. Slowly roll (extend) your mid back over the top of the ball so your head gets closer to the ground.When you feel a nice stretch (not painful), hold it for 15 seconds and repeat 10 – 15 times per day.
Do the ""Superman"" pose. Lay face down on some padded flooring with your arms outstretched above your head. Lift your chin, arms and as much of your legs off the ground as you can — simulating Superman flying. Hold for 15 seconds and repeat 10 – 15 times per day. Make sure you place a pillow under the stomach so as not to hyper extend your back as you raise your head, arms and legs.
Swimming, rowing exercises and yoga classes will also help to make your thoracic spine (and many other areas of your body) more flexible.
Use a back stretcher, which is a curved lumbar stretcher you place on the ground and lie on for several minutes a day (start out with one minute, gradually increasing to five minutes). Lie down face-up on a back stretcher beneath your middle back. Slowly extend your back on it. This helps offset the constant forward slouched position.

, In addition to weak muscles in the mid back, overly tight muscles in the chest also contribute to pulling the shoulders forward and out of alignment. Ironically, this posture is relatively common in men who go to the gym, but spend too much time on their chest (pectoral) and anterior shoulder muscles and not enough time on their rhomboids (between the shoulder blades) and posterior shoulder muscles. The solution is to avoid overworking the pectorals and make sure they are well stretched and pliable. A similar problem occurs when the muscles of the lower neck (trapezius and levator scapulae) become too tight / strong — they pull up on the shoulders and make it look like the person is always shrugging.


To stretch out your chest muscles, stand in a doorway or against a corner and raise the arm closest to the wall to shoulder-height. Your arm should be bent at the elbow. This posture resembles half of a football goal post. Rest your arm against the wall or doorframe, and use it to gently stretch your shoulder for 30 seconds. Turn your head and look in the opposite direction of your shoulder to intensify the stretch. Then switch to the opposite shoulder and repeat. Stretching five to 10 times daily will help loosen your chest muscles and allow your shoulders to retract.
Once your neck is warmed up, start stretching it by laterally flexing your neck and head (bending it sideways) — try to bring your ear closer to your shoulder. Hold for 30 seconds and do both sides five to 10 times daily. Loosening your neck muscles will allow your shoulders to gradually lower.

, A chiropractor is a spinal specialist trained at assessing posture. Not only can they tell you if your posture is poor, but they can usually pinpoint the cause and offer natural solutions. Chiropractors can diagnose spinal abnormalities that cause misaligned shoulders (scoliosis, osteoporosis, hyperkyphosis), typically with x-rays. They can also make your spine more flexible and functional with manual joint manipulations called spinal adjustments.


A chiropractor may apply joint manipulation to the middle back to relieve shoulder pain. The middle back is often overlooked as an area of focus for shoulder pain; however, recent research indicates that thoracic spine manipulation is effective for shoulder pain.A misaligned shoulder may also be due to a slight dislocation called a subluxation, where the joint is not quite aligned properly. Ask your chiropractor to check both shoulder joints in addition to your spine.
Sometimes misaligned shoulders are due to issues lower in your body, such as a short leg or an unlevel pelvis. Adjusting the pelvis to realign it and adding a lift to your shoe can help balance your lower body, which positively impacts your upper body.
Keep in mind that spinal adjustments can't reverse deformities such as scoliosis and are not indicated for an osteoporosis-related hyperkyphosis.

, Poor body posture is essentially caused by habitually slouching forward while sitting or standing. Contrary to popular belief, your spine is not meant to be straight like a pole. A healthy spine has three natural curves, which makes it look like the letter S from the side.A forward curve at the neck meets an outward curve in the mid back, which blends into another forward curve in the low back. As such, from a side view, your shoulders should be in line with your hip joints (in the middle of your pelvis) and ankles.


When sitting, standing, and walking, remind yourself to push your shoulders back, tighten your abdominal muscles, lift your chin up and keep your gaze straight ahead. Don't continually lean forward, look down or sit at crooked angles.
Poor posture is particularly debilitating for children because their growing bones can be somewhat deformed from habitual slouching and misalignment. These postural deformities are very difficult to reverse in adulthood.
Poor posture puts extra strain on muscles and joints, which can lead to chronic aches and pains and increase the risk of arthritis and injuries.

, Shoulder injuries from playing sports or other traumas, such as car accidents or falls, can also misalign your shoulder girdle and upper body. For example, dislocated shoulders, separated shoulders, upper arm or collarbone fractures, and various degrees of sprains and muscles tears can cause the shoulder joint to sag lower or jut forward more than it should.As such, make sure your shoulder injury is properly treated and fully healed before returning to activities that stress it.


Physiotherapy is sometimes needed after a significant shoulder injury to regain full strength within the shoulder girdle muscles and attain full range of motion within the glenohumeral (""ball and socket"") joint.
Not being able to fully move and use your shoulder — due to chronic pain, an unhealed joint injury, arthritis — can quickly atrophy and shorten surrounding muscles. Tight, weak muscles then act to slowly pull the shoulder out of normal alignment.

, Scoliosis is a condition of unknown cause that leads to an unnatural curve (deformity) of the spine, usually in the thoracic (mid back) region. One of the telltale signs of scoliosis is unlevel shoulders.Not only does one shoulder sit lower than the other, but the related shoulder blade often appears more prominent (sticks out more) than the other. Misaligned shoulders and upper bodies is usually what tips off a school nurse or family doctor that a child has scoliosis.


Scoliosis appears and progresses during childhood (early teens), then stabilizes once adulthood is reached and the skeleton stops growing.
Scoliosis is thought to be a little more common and have the potential to become more severe in young girls.
If scoliosis is the cause of misaligned shoulders, then virtually nothing can be done to correct it. Instead, the focus should be on making sure the shoulder is strong and fully functional. Practicing good posture is especially important so the misalignment doesn't get worse.

, Osteoporosis, also called brittle bone disease, involves a lack of normal bone mineralization. Without enough minerals, such as calcium, magnesium and boron, bones are much more susceptible to breaking, particularly in the hip and spine.Compression-type fractures in the mid back (thoracic region) are most common, which tends to cause a humpback (hyperkyphosis) and push the shoulders and neck too far forward. Once the humpback forms, only corrective surgery can help realign the spine and shoulders.


Osteoporosis is most common among elderly Caucasian and Asian women, especially those who are slender and inactive.
To help prevent osteoporosis, make sure you get adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D, and exercise on a regular basis.
Good sources of calcium include: low-fat dairy products, green leafy vegetables, canned salmon, tofu and fortified cereals and juices."

Do a figure four on the floor.,
Progress to a standing figure four.,
Combine the figure four with the chair pose.,
Move to double pigeon pose.,
Try adding a twist.",How to Do a Seated Figure Four2," The figure four on the floor is also called the eye of the needle pose, because you thread your arm through your legs as though you are threading a needle. This pose is restful and also provides a good stretch for your outer hips and thighs.Lie on your back on the floor. Make sure your shoulders are rolled back so that your shoulder blades are tucked along your spine, and your lower back is flat against the floor.
Lift your legs and bend your knees at right angles so that your shins are parallel to the floor and your thighs are perpendicular.
Cross one leg over the other so that your ankle is resting on your thigh just above your knee. Essentially, you're recreating the seated figure four position, except that you're lying on your back.
Grasp your lower thigh with your hands, threading one of your arms through the space between your legs. Breathe deeply. Hold the pose for 5 to 10 breaths, then release and switch to the other side.

, The standing figure four is a balancing pose that is a little more challenging than the figure four you do either sitting or lying down. If you don't have a strong sense of balance, it may take you some time to work up to it.Do this pose next to a wall if you have trouble balancing, so you have something to support you.
Bend your knees slightly and lift one foot, bending your knee to rest your ankle on the thigh of your standing leg. Press your ankle into your thigh and find your balance.
Lock the pose by resting your elbows on your knee and ankle, pressing your palms together. You can also press one palm against the sole of your foot. Hold for three to five deep breath cycles, then release and repeat with the other foot.

, After you've mastered the standing figure four, you can deepen the stretch by lowering your hips into chair pose. This tough balancing pose mimics the same position your body is in when you're doing a seated figure four.Instead of leaning forward over your crossed leg, keep your torso up straight, shoulders back. Press your palms together in front of your chest and hold the pose for three to five breath cycles. Release and repeat on the other side.

, Of all the ""pigeon"" or ""figure four"" variations, the double pigeon pose may be the most intense. Take it slow, and don't attempt this pose if it causes you any pain or discomfort.Sit on the floor and stack your shins one on top of the other in a modified cross-legged position. You may want a rolled blanket behind your hips if you have a hard time maintaining a straight back in this position.
Hinge forward from the hips, extending your arms out in front of you. Only fold forward as far as you can go without any pain or discomfort. As you continue to practice this pose, you'll be able to fold forward more deeply.
Hold the pose for 5 to 10 deep breath cycles, then release and switch your legs so that the one that was stacked on the bottom is now stacked on top, and repeat your fold.

, You can increase the intensity of any of the figure four variations by working in a spinal twist from the figure four position. Make sure you are twisting at the waist, and that your hips remain squared forward.If you're including a twist with any of the figure four variations, make sure you twist in both directions with both your right and left legs.

Try a half-pigeon.,
Fold forward into a reclining pigeon.,
Work your outer hips with the cow face pose.,
Relax in happy baby pose.",How to Do a Seated Figure Four3," The half-pigeon is a relatively intense hip opener, but if your hips are fairly loose it also can be a relaxing pose. Take it slowly and focus on your breath. If you feel any pain or discomfort, pull out of the pose immediately.Start on all fours. Move one foot forward so that it is between your hands, then bend at the knee so that your shin and knee can rest on the floor. Extend your other leg straight back behind you.
Slowly lower into the pose until you are all the way on the floor. Keep your torso erect. Only go as deeply as you can without pain or discomfort.
Stay in the pose for three to five breath cycles, then raise back onto all fours and repeat the pose on the other side.

, From the half-pigeon leg position, you can get a deeper stretch in your hips, glutes, and thighs by folding your torso over across your front leg. Fold from the hips and keep your back straight and flat.Make sure your shoulders are rolled back and your shoulder blades are tucked down alongside your spine. Avoid crunching your shoulders or hunching them up around your ears as you fold forward.
At first, try lowering to your elbows. As your hips get looser, you can recline all the way down to the floor, extending your arms out overhead and resting your forehead on the floor.
Hold the pose for three to five breath cycles, then release and repeat on the other side.

, The seated figure four is intended to stretch your outer hips. The cow face pose goes a little further to provide a more intense stretch. You may want to use a folded blanket or yoga block as a prop.Start this pose on all fours. Cross one knee over the other, and then press your hips back until you are sitting on the floor. If going all the way to the floor is too much of a stretch, a folded blanket or yoga block will give you a little elevation so you don't have to stretch as far.
Place your hands on your feet or ankles. Hold the pose for five to ten deep breath cycles, then release. Extend your legs in front of you and shake them out a little before standing.

, Happy baby pose stretches your inner thighs, and can be used as something of a counter-stretch from pigeon or figure four stretches. It also is a good pose to relax in at the end of your practice.Lie on your back and raise your legs, bending your knees. Grasp the arches of your feet with your hands and pull your thighs down alongside your torso. Make sure your entire spine is flat against the floor.
In this pose, you can rock back and forth or up and down to gently massage your spine, or you can remain still. Hold the pose as long as you want, breathing deeply and feeling the stretch in your thighs and hips.

Drink water.,
Increase your protein and healthy fat consumption.,
Avoid sugar.,
Eat breakfast.",How to Stay Awake Without Caffeine2," Staying naturally hydrated with water will help you feel more alert. The act of drinking water interrupts other work, which gives you a “mini break,” and hydration helps your body function smoothly, which helps you feel awake. , Foods that are high in proteinand healthy fatsprovide sustained energy that releases slowly into your body.


These foods do not lead to a blood sugar or energy “crash” like sugary or caffeinated food and drink.
These foods also help make you feel full longer, which may help you avoid snacking on sugary foods.

, Sugar, like caffeine, often leads to highs and lows in energy. Consuming sugar can lead to a “sugar buzz” with temporarily increased energy followed by a crash, where the sugar has worn off and you are left feeling exhausted. , While this may not help an immediate need for energy, if you have a chronic problem with feeling tired, a healthy breakfast every morning will help you feel more energetic. It gets your metabolism functioning smoothly and kickstarts your energy for the day. Choose healthy foods which give long-lasting energy, such as yogurt, eggs, protein smoothies, a bowl of high-fiber cereal, fruit salad, oatmeal, and so on.
Avoid high-sugar foods, such as sugary cereals and pastries. These will give you a crash later.
Be careful of insubstantial meals. There is nothing wrong with eating a slice of melon or a breakfast smoothie. However, if you find at 10:30 you are overwhelmed by fatigue, that is a signal that either you need a more hearty breakfast, or a healthy snack at this time.

Move around.,
Go to the gym.,
Do yoga or other stretching.,
Take a power nap, if allowed.,
Take a shower.",How to Stay Awake Without Caffeine3," If you are sitting down and working, try to stand up every 5-10 minutes. Do a few jumping jacks or a dance to your favorite song if you need a burst of energy to jump-start your productivity. Going for a short walk down the hall (or, better yet, outside) also helps. , If you consistently feel sleepy in the middle of the day or just after lunch, try getting in a midday workout. Exercise, though it expends energy, also boosts energy.Hit the gym during your lunch hour.
Go for a brisk walk outside.
Walk around the building. Walk some flights of stairs to the fourth-floor office and back. Take some laps around the field house at your high school. Pop by your boss's office instead of sending a message.
Find an office workout routine if you cannot leave work to exercise. This may include push-ups, chair sits, lunges, and sit-ups. Just remember to close the blinds to your office window!

, Yoga, while calming, is also rejuvenating. Doing a few yoga poses that promote energy when you feel tired can give your body an energy boost. Here are a few poses to try: Camel pose: while on your knees, arch your back so that your heart and your chest are open forward. With your feet flexed and your toes grounded, reach back and hold your ankles with your hands, and let your head fall back to stretch your neck.
Warrior Two: do a deep lunge, with the forward knee straight above the ankle and the foot facing the wall in front of you. The back leg should be extended with the leg straight and the foot sideways, perpendicular to the forward foot. Extend both arms out in the directions of your legs and look forward, over your extended arm and forward foot. Be sure to alternate sides.
Chair pose: stand with your feet flat on the floor, shoulder-width apart. Then sink down into a squat, as though you were going to sit in a chair. Be sure to keep your back completely flat. Raise both arms up over your head, shoulder-width apart, palms facing each other but not touching and fingers spread. Hold for several seconds, then stand up. Rest and repeat several times.

, Ward off extreme fatigue by taking a short nap. Evaluate whether this option is appropriate for you based on where you are. This is obviously not an option if you are driving, and it may not be an option if you are at work. The nurse's office at school sometimes encourages a lie-down, with the advantage that you have someone to nudge you awake before your next period.
Try to sleep for at least 20 minutes.
Try other methods of staying awake to rouse yourself fully after you wake from your nap so you don’t feel even more sleepy.

, Taking a shower is sometimes even better than taking a nap. It can refresh you and make you feel like you are ready for more work. A cold shower may be necessary if you are extremely tired. The temperature changes from taking a warm shower then stepping out into cool air can also help you wake up.

Write down notes.,
Laugh at something comedic.,
Socialize with someone.,
Sing!,
Find a happy place.",How to Stay Awake Without Caffeine4," If you find yourself feeling tired in a meeting—particularly one that is boring—try taking notes about what people are saying. The active participation of taking notes will help keep you mentally engaged with the ideas, which will keep you more alert.


You will remember the information more clearly.
It will look like you are paying careful attention.
You may find it helpful to look back at your notes later if your mind was wandering during the meeting.

, Laughter is the best medicine for many reasons, and staying awake is one of them. Watching a funny video clip or listening to a humorous story and laughing out loud at it will help you be more alert. You can stimulate your thinking by engaging in something funny that interests you.
Laughing will offer a break and release from other things you’re doing that may be tedious or unpleasant.

, If you have been working by yourself, engaging in a conversation with another person can help wake up your mind. Engaging in conversation and an exchange of ideas will get your mind working. If you can walk over to the other person, you will get a physical boost as well.


Talking fast may also help you feel more energetic. Try upping the tempo of your speech while chatting with someone. , The action of singing coordinates body, mind, and soul. It requires mental energy to recall notes and lyrics, requires your body to breathe deeply and evenly, and is a pleasurable experience. Sing on your own, sing with the car stereo, or make up your own song for a real challenge.

, Feeling happy makes people feel more energetic, so making yourself feel happy if you’re stressed or down will give your day a boost.Keep your favorite photos of loved ones or pets nearby at work to give yourself a happy reminder.

Consider your body type.,
Look into your type of yoga.,
Consider where you're doing yoga.,
Be wary of PVC mats.,
Try a rubber mat.,
Use a padded mat.,
Look into cotton.,
Consider a non-slip mat.,
Consider texture.,
Choose a mat that's appropriately thick for your needs.,
Pick a mat that's easy to store.,
Consider accessories.,
Look into price.",How to Choose a Yoga Mat," The type of yoga mat you need depends, to an extent, on your body type. Slimmer bodies may benefit from thicker mats or padded mats, as you have less natural cushioning from fat deposits on your body. Standard yoga mats are 1/8 of an inch thick, but go up to 1/4 of an inch. Consider a thicker mat if your body is more petite. If you have a more robust frame, you may be able to get by with a mat that's only 1/8 of an inch thick.If your joints get sore easily, you may need a thicker mat even if you have a more robust frame. Thicker mats, or mats with extra padding, can be easier on the joints.
Also, keep length in mind if you're tall. A standard yoga mat is 68 inches long, which may not be long enough if you're on the taller side. Look into a super-stretched yoga mat if you're more than 5'6"" tall.;
, The type of yoga you'll be doing can also affect what kind of mat you should purchase. Consider your yoga level before purchasing a mat.


If you're new to yoga, it's okay to go with a less high quality mat. Go for a basic mat between $10 and $20. You may decide yoga is not for you, so you do not want to invest in expensive equipment. Also, as you figure out how your body responds to yoga, you'll be better able to figure out your personal needs. Go for a cheap mat now and then choose a more expensive one down the road.
Flow yoga classes require more complex movements, and you'll need a mat with more traction to keep your arms and legs in place. For yin classes, however, you'll primarily be sitting on the ground, so grip is less important. Instead, go for a soft, cushy mat.Some people engage in a form of ""hot yoga,"" in which they engage in yoga in a heated room. If you're doing hot yoga, you may want to choose a mat specifically designed for this type of yoga. Such mats prevent your sweat from being absorbed by the mat, preventing them from becoming sweaty and damaged., Where you're going to do yoga also makes a big difference in your mat type. If you intend to primarily do yoga at home, for example, you do not need to worry about a lightweight mat you can transport easily. However, if you take yoga classes outside your home, you may want to look into a mat you can carry around easily.


You may also want to look into a lighter weight mat if you travel a lot and do yoga when on the road. You may also want to consider investing in a second yoga mat that you can bring on trips.

, Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) is one of the most commonly used materials to make yoga mats. However, it has a bad reputation in the yoga community as some studies indicate it may be a carcinogen. It is also hard to recycle. In the event your mat gets old and worn out, you'll simply have to throw it away. If you're a health-conscious person, you may want to avoid a PVC mat., Many people prefer mats made out of natural rubber to PVC mats. A simple rubber mat is about as easy to find as PVC mat, but has a better reputation among yoga enthusiasts.A rubber mat may be a good idea if you're just starting out, as they're simple to find and somewhat inexpensive.

, Padded mats are a lot softer and more comfortable than regular yoga mats. A padded yoga mat is made of two parts: an inside portion, made of foam, and an outer removable cloth covering.These mats can be great for yoga that involves a lot of sitting or lying down. They generally provide a lot more support than the average mat. However, they do not provide a lot of grip. You may find yourself slipping and falling during certain poses when using a padded mat.One downside to padded mats is that they can only be partially washed. You can wash the outer cloth layer, but the internal foam is non-washable., Some yoga mats are simply made of cotton. Many prefer cotton because it's a more natural material.While cotton may retain more sweat, it is easily washable. It is also soft, but may have slightly more grip than a padded mat. However, cotton can more easily retain sweat. A cotton yoga mat may require frequent washing.

, Non-slip mats, also known as sticky mats, are mats designed to allow you to move into many different positions. These mats provide added grip and stick. If you're doing a particularly rigorous form of yoga, consider a non-slip mat., The texture of your mat makes a difference in terms of your personal comfort. Mats come in a variety of textures, so make sure you consider texture carefully before making a choice.


Stickier mats, like non-stick mats, tend to have a rougher texture. While this can irritate skin, it can actually be an advantage if you're doing yoga that involves a lot of intense poses.If you prefer a smooth mat, PVC mats may be the best way to go. However, many yoga supply companies sell more eco-friendly mats that offer a smooth texture. Try looking into a company with a reputation for being environmentally conscious if you want a smooth, non-PVC mat., As stated, if you're new to yoga, you'll need more padding. Most standard yoga mats are 1/8 of an inch thick, which may not be thick enough for a beginner. However, yoga mats can be as thick as 1/4 of an inch. If you need more padding, consider going for a thicker mat.A good in-between would be a mat of 1/6 of an inch. If you're new to yoga, but more petite in frame, this may be a good option for you. A mat of in-between thickness may also be good if you travel a lot, as they're easier to roll up and transport.

, It can be cumbersome to have a yoga mat that's difficult to roll up. Go for a mat that's made of a lightweight material and rolls up easily. Test out a mat in the store by rolling it up a few times. Make sure the mat is easy to maneuver so you will not have to worry about storing it.

, Depending on your needs, you may need certain accessories for your yoga mat. A handle may be a good idea if you travel to yoga each day. You may also want to purchase a carrying case for your mat, as well as a cotton buckle to secure your mat when you roll it up.

, Yoga mats vary greatly in price. A 1/8-inch thick PVC mat with no padding, stickiness, or other frills will be your cheapest option. You can get a mat of this nature for around $10, but it will wear out fast. If you're serious about yoga, consider investing in a higher quality mat.If you plan on doing yoga longterm, go for a pricier mat from a reputable sports or yoga company. A mat from Lululemon Athletica, for example, may be a worthy investment if you're a yoga enthusiast.
Certain features, like padding and stickiness, do cost extra. However, if you've decided this extras are important to you due to your personal needs, they may be worth the extra price.

Don't fight the treatment.,
Try to relax after the treatment because your muscles need to rest.",How to Prepare For and Receive Acupuncture," Acupuncture has been used for thousands of years in China and Asia.However, it doesn't follow a Western European method of disease diagnosis and treatment, so it is useful to consider this as an alternative method to rectify your condition.


Read about it in books or magazines.
Talk to an acupuncture practitioner, or to someone who has successfully used it.
Read information on suitable websites, such as government health departments or traditional Chinese medicine schools with a good reputation.;
, If you are extremely adverse to trying it, no one can or should convince you to do so. However, if you are convinced it might work for you, or you're feeling desperate for another treatment route, acupuncture might be extremely helpful and be exactly what you need. Acupuncture can relieve pain, reduce symptoms, or help restore balance to your body's system. Only you can decide if it is worth giving it a try.


Be wary of anyone who claims it can cure anything more substantial, however, as it doesn't cure cancer and cannot save you from an incurable illness.

, If you have decided to try acupuncture, see if it is covered by your insurance plan or your health system's welfare coverage.


Your doctor might have to refer you for treatment to get it covered. Discuss this idea with your doctor first if you'd like.
If it's not covered, decide if you can afford to pay out of pocket for it on your own. In case money is an issue search for a local ""community style"" acupuncturist who treats people in a group setting which cuts costs down on the cost of treatment.

, Depending on where you live, you might easily find a qualified acupuncture doctor, or you may not. The NIH, however, has found that acupuncture is being widely practiced by physicians, dentists, acupuncturists, and other practitioners.You will need to check if acupuncture is regulated where you live; a state, province, or region may or may not certify such doctors, making it harder for you to know whether or not your acupuncturist is reputable.


If you are having difficulties finding out, inquire in a local Oriental medicine clinic or college for more information.
If you know of people who have had successful treatments, ask for their recommendation.
Always ask to see their credentials and state license., Acupuncture is a system in which you receive a series of up to 20 treatments of up to an hour each (or more), spread out over several weeks. There will usually be a day or two between each treatment or possibly a week depending on your condition. Acupuncture focuses on treating overall well-being and not just the symptoms, taking a holistic approach. This means you must set aside time because it is useless to take only one treatment, or to begin a series and not finish it. Not finishing a course of treatment is a waste of money.

, Go to the acupuncturist and tell him/her your problem. Show your acupuncturist where your pain is, explain your symptoms, tell him/her what you've tried before, what you eat, how you sleep. Be open to the acupuncturist's explanation and suggestions. Expect the explanation to be different from what a Western doctor may say.

, Tell the acupuncturist if this is your first time. He/she will probably explain what is going on in more detail for a new patient. Normally, you will lie on a regular examination or massage bed, and remove clothes from the areas the acupuncturist tells you to. You will be draped in a sheet or towel, plus a blanket if it's cold. Be sure to wear loose clothing when you go for your appointment.


The acupuncturist will unwrap brand new never used sterile needles from plastic packets. They might also swab the insertion areas with alcohol (this is required for qualified acupuncturists in the USA). You might not see where they will be inserted.

, Close your eyes and let your muscles loosen. This is a time to focus your energy inward toward healing. Focus on the fact that you have pain or something wrong, and you want to get better. Let this happen.


You will feel a small prick when the needle is inserted. After that first instant, you should feel nothing. If you feel a sudden sharp nerve pain, alert the acupuncturist to let him or her know. He/she might need to remove the needle and insert it in a slightly different place.
The acupuncturist may insert up to 20 different needles at various points, though the first treatment may have fewer. Lie still. Close your eyes. Relax. Visualize the areas of pain or problems, and how they must improve. You should soon feel absolutely nothing. Rest. Take a little nap. Meditate.
Pain is subjective, and many people report no or minimal pain from acupuncture.If there is undue pain, alert the practitioner immediately as it may be the result of improper placement of the needles, a defective needle, or your own movement causing a slip.

, This could be anywhere from 20-60 minutes, less at first. Don't plan to read, though you could listen to quiet music. It's best to simply snooze or meditate.

, You have decided to receive acupuncture. Now you must relax, not argue, or stress. Otherwise it won't work as well. Go with it. If you decide later not to return, that's your choice. During the treatment, simply lie there. It won't hurt after the first moment.

, Bruising is normal if you had needles inserted into you.

Consider starting your own business.",How to Become an Acupuncturist," Not everyone can be an acupuncturist, as it requires several specific skills. You will need good hand-eye coordination, steady hands, strong communications skills, and a passion for working with people.;
, As a traditional practice, there are a variety of different schools of thought regarding best practices, such as traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Five Element., Find out what they did to earn their certification, and why they went into the profession. They can also tell you about the difficulties you will encounter in trying to get started, as both a student and practitioner., If you want to work in the United States, then you'll have to demonstrate a command of the English language to work as an acupuncturist. You will have to know how to understand and communicate flawlessly with your patients, and review clinical records.


When it comes to acupuncture, it is crucial to know exactly what to say to your patients and to understand when your patients are expressing discomfort or concern.
Depending on the school of acupuncture you follow, you may also need to learn the traditional language of that school., Certification requirements vary widely by state. Some states require you to earn a doctor of medicine degree, while others only necessitate hourly coursework with supervised training. These requirements will dictate the path you need to take to be an acupuncturist in your state.Each state will also have rules regarding the ""scope of practice,"" that is, what you are allowed to do once licensed in that state.
Individual states have different rules regarding certification reciprocity. If you want to practice acupuncture in two or more states, check with the individual states to determine what their rules are regarding the recognition of other state certifications.
If you're already a physician and would like to practice acupuncture, check out the American Board of Medical Acupuncture, which offers examinations and explains the standards for physicians who want to practice acupuncture., Most acupuncture training programs require students to have a bachelor's degree. Your degree can be in any subject, but you may want to take classes in fields such as physiology, anatomy, biology, and psychology. A bachelor's degree in a health care or alternative medicine related subject can also be helpful for a career as an acupuncturist.While a bachelor's degree is ideal, some acupuncture schools only require two academic years of education at the baccalaureate level, or the equivalent, such as certification for a medical profession such as nursing.
The requirements vary by program and state, so look at the requirements for your state and program.

, Each college will have a different emphasis, but all will involve the study and practice of acupuncture, along with other aspects of Chinese herbal medicine. Most acupuncture programs take about 3 years to finish, and up to 4 years for a program in oriental medicine.Schools are certified by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM), which can help you find programs in your state., The National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) provides the general certification for the profession. You will need to fill out an application, available on their website, and pay a certification fee. Though this is a private organization, NCCAOM certification can pass for licensing in many states.The application fee for Acupuncture Certification is currently $475. Different certifications granted by the NCCAOM have different fees, so be sure to check if you intend to get a different certification.The application also requires official transcripts from your AOM program, so be sure to contact your school and tell them to send those in.
It is best to begin filling out the certification paperwork in the final year of your studies. It is best to check with your school for the best time to get that paperwork in. You don't want to delay certification, as the process takes some time, and it will be very hard (if not impossible) to get a job without it., Once your application has been processed and approved by the organization and state board, you will be allowed to sign up to take the certification exam. This exam is required for licensure in most states. Once you pass this exam, you are board certified. In most states, you will be recognized as a licensed acupuncturist (L.Ac.). Some states will use the designation ""Acupuncture Physician"" or ""Doctor of Oriental Medicine.""The NCCAOM's website provides study guides to help prepare for the exam.You cannot take the exam without first having your application approved by the NCCAOM.
Some states will require additional exams for more certification. Check the list provided by the NCCAOM for the requirements in your state., Most beginner acupuncturists start out working with an established practice to gain experience and build up a client base. Acupuncturist jobs are typically easier to find in larger metropolitan areas than in small towns. You may have to start with an apprenticeship or an internship to gain more experience to make yourself a desirable candidate for an independent practice.

, It's not easy to make a living as an acupuncturist, and if you want to survive in the business, then you have to remember that your clients are everything to you. You need to be polite, learn a little bit about them and remember the things they've told you on previous visits, to be friendly and approachable, and to make sure they feel comfortable coming to your office time after time.


After each visit, make sure your clients book a follow up appointment right away. This will encourage them to keep coming.
Call up your clients the day before their appointments. This will greatly reduce the rate of no-shows and will show them you care.
You can also get referrals from your clients. Ask them if they have any friends who would be interested in your practice. This is a great way to get even more clients.

, If you want to succeed, you can't just stop with your license to be an acupuncturist. You should take night classes at a community college or pursue another Master's degree in a relevant field such as Acupuncture Practice Management, Marketing, or Business Success Principles. Many practitioners get into trouble when they focus only on healing principles and techniques and don't think about the business end of things. If you really want to help your clients, then you have to gain skills to help you keep your business afloat.


Attending any continuing education courses can give you valuable experience, even if they aren't business-related. Just as in any field of medicine, acupuncture treatments are constantly evolving. Pursue continuing training to learn new strategies, improve your techniques and keep your skills current.

, Your certification from NCCAOM will need renewal every four years. You will need to fill out a form, and document your participation in Professional Development Activities (PDA). You will need a minimum of 60 points worth of PDA to qualify for recertification. You should mail your application materials to the NCCAOM at least 60 days before your certification is due to lapse. To prepare for recertification, read the handbook posted on the Council's website.If you miss these deadlines, your status will be considered ""Lapsed"" or ""Inactive,"" and require additional work to regain certification.

, Once you've gained some experience, understood the business side of things, and have developed a client base, you should consider starting your own acupuncture business. With your knowledge, you can become a business owner and have your clients follow you to your new practice. The more connections you have in the field, the better.


If you know a few acupuncturists who would want to move to your business with you, you already have a leg up.

Determine the general style you prefer.Yoga pants come in a variety of general yoga pants styles.,
Decide on the length you want.Length is a matter of both comfort and function.,
Choose your type of stretch.Yoga pants are popular for use during yoga and other activities because of their comfort.,
Pick a waist you like.You can find a variety of waist types to choose from in yoga pants.,
Determine the best fabric for you.Your style of yoga will have an impact on what type of fabric you want to use.,
Pick a color that suits you.",How to Choose Yoga Pants1," Within those styles, you can find variations. Capris pants, for example, generally have a shorter leg. Drawstring typically use a string, rather than elastic, to secure the waist. Pick a general style to start with and begin evaluating the aspects you like and dislike.


Picking a style should not be considered a definitive choice. This is just a starting point. You may choose a style of yoga pants similar to what you are already used to seeing or using. As you evaluate the characteristics, you should allow your choice to change as you become better acquainted with the pros and cons of each pair.;
, Yoga pants generally come in two lengths, full length or capris. Capris pants end at your calf muscle. Full-length stop at your ankle. Full-length pants that are tight may bunch at the ankle if only a little too long. Capris pants typically do not bunch but may be too tight on your thigh if not stretchy enough.

, This comfort is created when the fabric used incorporates stretchy threads or knits. Most fabrics have a natural 2-way stretch. Pants with a 4-way stretch will be more comfortable. However, if you prefer baggy or loose fitting yoga pants, a 2-ways stretch may work just fine.

, Some sit higher on your waist than others. Some incorporate a drawstring while others use elastic bands. Perform a range of motions while trying on a new pair of yoga pants. You should be able to sit on the ground and lean forward to touch your toes or ankles without excessive strain at the waistline.


Some waists will rise during use. You can avoid this problem the pants as high as they will go (i.e., tight to the crotch area) and assess the waistline there. If the waist is too high, either purchase a different pair or fold the top down to overlap waist.
Drawstring knots can be uncomfortable during many yoga positions. Elastic waists are generally preferred for that reason.

, Synthetic fabrics, such as polyester, tend to breathe better than cotton fabrics but may pill faster. Cotton fabrics will absorb moisture, but they will help keep your body warmer during less intense yoga classes.


Over time, all fabrics will wear with friction. The formation of pills--tiny knots of loose fibers--occurs in both cotton and synthetic fabrics. However, pilling is typically more pronounced in synthetic fabrics since small plastic fibers can anchor pills more than cotton fibers.

, You can find a variety of colors and patterns for your yoga pants.Depending on the amount of sweating and fabric you choose, you may need to consider sweat patches. Light colored cotton and poly-cotton (e.g., heather colors) clothes tend to show sweat spots so darker cotton and poly-cotton fabrics may be preferable.With Synthetic materials, you can pick about any color you'd be comfortable with.

Anusara yoga is very concerned with alignment. Anusara classes can be challenging, but are usually taught so that any level of student can participate. Anusara classes use props to help find proper alignment in poses.



 


Ashtanga yoga is one of the most vigorous yoga styles. It builds stamina, strength and flexibility. Ashtanga yoga classes run through a predetermined series of poses so if you like both challenge and routine, Ashtanga might be the style for you.






Bikram yoga is a type of hot yoga. Bikram yoga classes are taught in hot rooms because Bikram practitioners find that warm muscles are more flexible. They do the same series of 26 asanas in each class, holding each pose twice.






Iyengar yoga focuses on precise alignment in postures. Props are used to make the poses more accessible. This is a good style for beginners who want to learn proper alignment in poses.






Kundalini yoga is meditative and spiritual, and emphasizes breathing and chanting.






Vinyasa yoga is usually characterized by quick-moving poses.






There are many other styles of yoga. If the studio you are interested in attending teaches another style, ask about the focus of that style before taking a class.





;
,

Look for a studio near your home or work that teaches a style of yoga you are interested in trying.






Choose a studio with an environment you enjoy. If there is a loud dance class next door or lights that are too bright, it can detract from your yoga experience.






Consider the times of classes available and the class sizes. It is especially important for beginners to be in a small class where the instructor can see you and make sure you are practicing safely.






If you do not have and do not wish to purchase equipment, find a studio that has all the equipment you will need to take a class. Most, but not all studios, have equipment available for student use.







,


Studios label their class levels in different ways. Make sure you read level and class descriptions carefully and follow the advice given.

,

Inquire about the teacher's qualifications. How long has the teacher been practicing? Where was the teacher certified? How long was the teacher's certification program?






Find a teacher you like and trust and whose teaching style you enjoy. Some people prefer a teacher who does hands-on adjustments to help them move into poses. Other people enjoy taking classes with a teacher who does not touch them. Figure out what you like.






Try different teachers to find one you like.

Decide on the nature of your activity.To pick the right pair of yoga pants you must first decide where you will be wearing them.,
Pick a material that will not hinder your movement or comfort.Synthetic materials will breathe better during sweaty activities.,
Choose a compression appropriate for your activity.If you are a runner or biker, you may prefer higher compression yoga pants compared to someone who speed walks.,
Determine what waist will work best for you.Many yoga pant waists are optimized for minimalism.,
Choose a pattern or color balancing your needs and desires.",How to Choose Yoga Pants2," You can choose to use yoga pants for any activity from weight lifting to running. The nature of your activity will put different strains on your pants. Will you be doing minimal movement (e.g., running or hiking)? Will you need full range of motion (e.g., weight lifting)?

, Loose cotton materials will keep you warm in the cold. Consider tight fitting, synthetic fiber pants when running in the heat. Loose cotton pants may work well when weight lifting for your upper body, but stretchy synthetic pants may be better when working your lower body.


You may also want to consider durability in your choice of fabric. Some yoga pants are stretchy but thin and prone to wear if worn for running. Some yoga pants designed for running are less stretchy because they are thicker thereby increasing the longevity of the pants.

, Compression can be used to highlight the shape of your legs or to attempt to enhance performance. It can also make pants feasible for bikers who can't afford to get a loose pant leg stuck in a gear. In general, this is a matter of your preference so try different levels of compression to see what works best for you.


Be careful when assessing the compression of a pair of yoga pants. A lot of compression may be a sign they simply do not fit. If your pants are so tight you can barely move or you can see your underwear then they are too tight.

, Simply an elastic band within already stretchy material. You may opt instead for a drawstring instead to hold up looser fitting pants. A pocket for your ID or keys is also a good idea for people running or biking outdoors. Be sure to pick a waist that is comfortable during your chosen activity.

, If you are working hard, you may want a darker color to hid any sweat. If you like to draw attention, bright colors will do the trick. Many athletic yoga pants will include patches of material woven together to provide breathability and stretch in certain locations. Make sure that the seams and unique characteristics do not interfere with any repetitive motions.

Establish the level of formality you wish to achieve.,
Find a color or pattern you love.If you are wearing your yoga pants for everyday casual wear, the sky's the limit.,
Pick a fabric that you find comfortable.,
Decide on any crossover activities.,
Pick pants that match the rest of your wardrobe.Choosing yoga pants for your normal attire cannot be done well without considering your other clothing.",How to Choose Yoga Pants3," Although you may be able to wear your yoga pants to the office,you must consider how they mimic other clothing to be successful. In general, the more your yoga pants resemble dress slacks the better your chances. This doesn't mean they have to look drab. Just opt for a looser fit and hem for more formal activities.


To be safe, consider your yoga pants as a replacement for blue jeans.In other words, if blue jeans would be too informal, avoid yoga pants. As your yoga pants resemble dressier slacks, the rule is less clear.
Some companies make yoga pants expressly to look like dress slacks., You can pick any color or pattern that you feel comfortable with. Pretty much anything goes with yoga pants.Be cautious wearing odd looking yoga pants to the office. Stick with solid colors such as you would find in any dress pants section. Blacks, browns, and grays are generally safe choices.

, This will largely depend on what you are doing and the temperature of the venue. If you are doing something rigorous or in warm weather you may want to consider a synthetic fabric that breaths when you sweat. If you are wearing them indoors or where it may be cold, a thicker cotton pair may be more appealing. Different fabrics are also stretchier. Try fabrics with a 4-way stretch for increased comfort instead of fabrics with only a 2-way stretch.

, Some people wear yoga pants simply as a replacement for other casual clothing. Others wear yoga pants so they don't need to change clothes before or after a workout. If you are one of the latter type of people, you would want to consider the type of physical activity when choosing your dress. Try picking a pair of yoga pants that will functionally work well with your activity, and choose a color or style that will fit your casual attire.

, Depending on who you base your fashion decisions on you may be pressed with many options. Patterns may be fashionable by some standards and grossly tacky by others. As a reliable friend to be the judge in these scenarios if you have questions as the matching and pairings are based solely on popular opinion.

Choose a top that covers everything.,
Try a tank top.,
Don't forget bra.,
Layer for cooler areas.,
Decide on a type of pant.,
Consider shorts.,
Think about capri tights.,
Consider a gusset.,
Check how high the waistband goes.,
Pick clothes that are form-fitting.,
Choose the right fabric.,
Go smooth for less distraction.,
Skip jeans.,
Know you don't necessarily need to buy clothes.,
Choose colors that make you happy.",How to Choose the Right Yoga Clothes (for Women)," You don't have to be extra modest, just because you're in yoga class. However, you should pick something that covers you up, even when you're moving around. If you constantly need to pull on your shirt to keep yourself covered, that's a big distraction., One option for a top is a simple tank top. It should probably be stretchy, though it doesn't have to be as long as you can move in it. Make sure it's form-fitting enough that it doesn't move much when you change positions, and pick one that provides a little support.Pick a longer tank top, so it will have less of a tendency to flip over your head when you bend., You want to buy a sports bra specifically for yoga. It should have some separation between your breasts, to provide air circulation. However, a sports bra for yoga doesn't have to be as heavy as one for, say, running. It can be lightweight, as long as it provides you with the support you need.Some women wear sports bras exclusively to do yoga in. They skip the top altogether, particularly when doing hot yoga.
Consider buying a top that has a built-in bra. That way, you only need to deal with one item of clothing on top instead of two.
Another option is sleeveless vests with incorporated sports bras, as they give you the comfort of a fitness top and sports bra in one.

, You may want to layer tops in places where it can get cool. You might want a zip-up hoodie, for instance, or a light shawl on top of your shirt. Plus, you can use it as shawl to cover yourself when practicing laying-down poses, so you're not as cold., You can wear a variety of pants when doing yoga. Leggings are a good choice, since they both stretch and hug the body. You can also choose more straight-legged varieties, as long as they aren't too loose. Try to go for something lightweight, so the fabric won't get in your way., Pants aren't a necessity when you're doing yoga. You can also wear shorts. Pick a pair that is comfortable, relatively short, and fairly form-fitting. If the shorts aren't form-fitting, they can flop around and get in the way., Another option is tights that come just past the knee. The tights should be breathable. They should also be thick enough so that you feel comfortable wearing just the tights. Make sure they aren't so tight that they cut off circulation as you hold poses., One feature that some yoga pants have is a gusset. A gusset is a diamond-shape piece of fabric added to the crotch area. The point is to take some of the pressure off of that area, making it more comfortable to do yoga., A relatively high waistband is a good thing. It helps your pants stay in place, and it covers you up as you move. However, if it's too high, it will just get in the way as you try to bend. Try to pick one that sits at your natural waist., Your clothing doesn't need to be so tight you can't move. However, if it's too loose, it's going to move around too much, distracting you while you try to practice. Make it loose enough so that you can move, but not so loose that it will float up or ride down.When you're trying on yoga clothes, try bending over and moving around to see how they stay in place.

, When looking at yoga clothes, make sure to pick a material that both breathes and keeps moisture away from your body. You can try a synthetic, moisture-wicking fabric, though some people prefer cotton. It's up to you. Just remember you're going to sweat in these clothes, so you want a fabric that will keep you comfortable.Also, you may want to choose a stretchy fabric that has a bit of spandex in it so it's easier to move around.

, That is, make sure you pick items that provide the most comfort, such as tagless shirts and pants or shorts with a smooth waistband.Also, think about the collar. It should be form-fitting without getting in the way of your movement., Jeans are restrictive, as they don't have much give. You can't move like you need to in jeans, so it's best to skip them when practicing yoga. That also holds for other restrictive materials, such as leather or corduroy. Stretchy is best., Yoga is about being comfortable and finding your center. If you already have clothes that you can move about in easily and that don't make a lot of noise (you don't want your crinkling to distract others), don't be afraid to wear those to class.In fact, most people in India wear comfortable everyday clothes to class, not special ""yoga"" clothes., Whether you prefer neutrals and dark colors or you tend to go for bright patterns, pick clothes that you feel happy and comfortable in. Forget about everyone else. If you like the color, it's right for you.

Inhale to the three abdominal targets.,
Exhale in reverse order.,
Practice your technique.",How to Breathe Like a Yoga Master1," Dirga Pranayama is often called the three-part breath, due to its focus on breathing into and out of three separate regions in the abdomen.It may sound simple, but it can be quite difficult to perfect.


Inhale through the nostrils in one long, continuous breath.Breathe into the first abdominal target, the low belly.With the same breath, breathe into the second target: the lower chest, at the bottom of the ribcage.Continuing the same inhalation, breathe into the third target, the lower throat. You should feel it just above your sternum.;
, Once you've inhaled into each of the three target areas, you'll begin exhaling. On the exhalation, focus on the three abdominal targets, but in reverse order.


Exhale through the nostrils in one long, continuous breath, just like on the inhalation.Focus on the lower throat first, then feel the exhalation move down into the lower chest and the lower belly., Learning how to breathe into and out of the three abdominal targets may be difficult for beginners. When starting out, it's best to isolate each individual abdominal target. You can do this by using your hands to track the movement of your breath.Rest one or both hands on each of the three abdominal targets. Focus your breath into and out of each target. You should feel your hand(s) move up and down on the inhalation and exhalation.Once you've learned how to focus your breath into each of the three individual abdominal targets with your hands, practice each target without touching your abdomen.When you've mastered breathing into and out of each target area without using your hands, connect each step and practice the entire process in one fluid breath."

Do cardio activities most days of the week.,
Add yoga sessions as you like.,
Choose postures that enhance your cardio.,
Schedule regular rest days.",How to Complement Cardio with Yoga1," Every adult should get at least 150 minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity every week. You can also do a mixture of moderate and vigorous cardio. Depending on what type of yoga you do, you can add how long you practice to your weekly cardio totals.Aim to get at least 30 minutes of cardio every day. You can do this all at once or break it up into manageable chunks, such as three 10-minute sessions.
Choose exercises you enjoy such as running, walking, swimming, or biking.
Recognize that yoga styles characterized by continuous movement can count towards your daily totals. These styles include Ashtanga, Jivamukti, Vinyasa, and power flow.;
, The wonder of yoga is that even if you do it for one hour a week, you’ll see benefits. Start out with 2-3 yoga sessions of 20-90 minutes every week, depending on your level of fitness and previous exposure to yoga. Gradually increase your practice as you are able or like. There are no guidelines to how often you should or shouldn’t do yoga.Remember that you can count more vigorous yoga to your weekly cardio totals if you like.Avoid setting unrealistic goals for yourself with your yoga practice. Do yoga as you can and have time and you can see benefits to your health and well-being., Although any yoga pose can complement your cardio, try asanas that enhance your workouts. This can further strengthen your stamina and muscles while helping you build better balance and flexibility. Poses that nicely complement cardio include:Standing split to stretch and strengthen quads and hamstrings
Happy baby to release and stretch hip joints
Low lunges to stretch the thigh muscles and hip flexors, and open chest muscles
High lunges to lengthen hip flexors
Extended puppy pose to stretch and lengthen the spine
Locust pose to strengthen the torso, legs, and arms
Reclining bound angle pose to stretch hip and groin muscles
Cross-legged twist to stretch the hips, chest, and back, Take at least one rest day per week from your yoga and cardio workouts. This is important because it lets your body recover, rebuild, and refresh for your next workout. You can either schedule a day on the sofa or have an “active” rest day where you do something such as go for a casual stroll or take a restorative yoga class.Keep in mind that active recovery should get you moving but not require a ton of effort. Stick to 30-60 minutes of easy movement as your active recovery. It’s also acceptable to just take the day off altogether.

Add variance to your technique.",How to Breathe Like a Yoga Master2," The Bhramari pranayama, often called ""the bee breath,"" focuses on a smooth nasal inhalation and a steady, vocal exhalation through the nostrils.Breathe in slowly and deeply through both nostrils., As you exhale, you should train your throat to make a soft, elongated hum of the letter ""e."" This should produce the characteristic buzzing sound associated with ""the bee breath.""Exhale slowly through both nostrils.Start out with a soft, silent ""eee"" buzz, and gradually increase the volume as you become more comfortable with this breathing routine. Do not strain your throat. The buzzing should feel somewhat natural., Once you've sufficiently practiced the bee breath, you can add some variety to your technique. This can help give you a deeper sense of calm as you perfect the Bhramari pranayama.


Extend your fingers, and use the thumb of your right hand to block your right nostril.Perform the same inhalation and exhalation as before, but push all of your breath in and out of your left nostril.Switch sides, using your left hand to block your left nostril. Push all of your breath in and out of your right nostril."
"
Whisper an ""h."" The Ujjayi pranayama is often called the ""victory"" or ""ocean-sounding breath,"" because the goal is to replicate the sound of crashing waves.,
Breathe in through the mouth.,
Exhale through the mouth.",How to Breathe Like a Yoga Master3," To do this, practice contracting the vocal cords until you can produce a steady, drawn-out ""h"" sound.You should feel a slight contraction in your throat as you whisper the ""h"" sound. It should not be painful or uncomfortable., Draw in a long, deep breath through your parted lips. Focus on contracting the vocal cords while you inhale, so you produce a soft ""ocean sound"" as you breathe in., As you exhale through your parted lips, focus on continuing to contract the vocal cords to produce the sustained ""h"" sound associated with Ujjayi pranayama.Once you've perfected the exhalation through your mouth, practice breathing out through your nostrils instead. With some experience, you should be able to produce the ""h"" sound while breathing out through the nose just as you did through the mouth."
"
Roll your tongue.,
Inhale through the tube.,
Exhale through the nostrils.",How to Breathe Like a Yoga Master4," Instead of breathing in and out through your nostrils, this yogic practice involves breathing in through a ""tube,"" made by rolling your tongue. If you cannot roll your tongue into a perfect tube, try to shape your tongue into as much of a cylinder as possible.Form a tube (or as much of a cylindrical shape as possible) with your tongue. Push the tip of your ""tongue tube"" out just past your lips.If you cannot roll your tongue on your own, you may need to use your hands to ""shape"" the tongue.

, Draw a slow, deep inhalation through your rolled-up tongue. Try to keep your lips tightly wrapped around your tongue to force all of the air through the ""tube"" you've formed with your tongue.As you inhale, tilt your head down and hold your chin against your chest.Feel the breath enter your lungs and hold the breath for approximately five seconds., Push the breath out of your nostrils in a slow, controlled exhalation. Try to exhale as you did during the Ujjayi pranayama. Focus on your chest and contract the vocal cords as the breath leaves your body through the nose.Do not practice the Shitali pranayama unless you are physically warm. Some yogis believe that the Shitali pranayama cools the body, which could be dangerous if you are cold or if you practice during the winter."
"
Inhale through the nostrils.,
Practice active exhalation.,
Gradually increase your exhalations.",How to Breathe Like a Yoga Master5," Draw in a slow, steady breath through the nose. Make sure it is an adequately deep breath, as the exhalation will require a steady supply of air., As you breathe out, it should be in a rapid, ""pumping"" pulse of exhalation. It may be helpful for beginners to put one hand on the stomach to feel the active belly-based pumping action.Release short, controlled ""snorts"" (without emitting any sound) through the nostril. It may be helpful to imagine that you are blowing out a candle with your breath.Practice releasing rapid, silent ""snorts"" in quick succession. Beginners should aim for approximately 30 exhalations in a 30 second period.Keep your staccato exhalations steady and controlled. Aim for consistency before you try to increase your exhalations., It's best to start slow, but once you've comfortably pumped 30 exhalations in 30 seconds, you can gradually increase the exhalations. Slowly work your way up to 45 to 60 exhalations over a 30 second period. Don't push yourself too hard or too fast. It's best to begin with two to three rounds of whatever number of exhalations is comfortable before attempting to increase the exhalations."

Begin in mountain pose.,
Sit your bum into chair pose.,
Hinge and bend forward.,
Rise up halfway into standing half forward bend.,
Step back or jump into four limbed staff pose.,
Roll your toes into upward facing dog.,
Finish in downward facing dog.,
Repeat sun salutations.",How to Complement Cardio with Yoga2," Sun salutations are a great complement to cardio and are the start of a healthy yoga practice. Not only do they build strength and endurance, they also help stretch out your muscles.Start by standing in mountain pose, which gets you ready to flow through sun salutations.Stand with your feet hip width apart and arms outstretched down your sides. Look straight ahead and distribute your weight evenly on each foot.
Engage your core and roll your tailbone towards the ground to elongate your spine.
Inhale and exhale evenly through your nose. This can aid your flow through sun salutations., Breathe in and bend your knees to “sit” towards the floor while raising your arms into the air. Arch your back slightly as you look up towards your extended arms. Keep your shoulders down and tilt your pelvis towards the floor.Extend your elbows as much as you can. Keep your hands in prayer position, which can make this easier.
Sit down as far as you can to try and get your knees parallel to the floor.

, From chair pose, you will flow into your next pose. Exhale, engage your core, and hinge at your hips into a forward fold.Keep your back straight when you fold from chair pose to your forward bend.Place your palms flat on the floor parallel to each foot. Bend your knees slightly if your hands can’t reach. Point your hands and fingers towards the front of your mat and keep your whole hand pressing into the floor. This can make it easier to flow into the next positions in your wake up sun salutation.

, Inhale as you rise up into a standing half forward bend. Your torso should be parallel to the floor. Your hands should also still be parallel to your feet., Chatturanga dandasana, or four limbed staff pose, is the next movement in your sun salutation. It should look as though you’re hovering in a pushup position over the floor. Four limbed staff pose will build overall strength and endurance.Step back into four limbed staff pose if you are new to yoga. Jump into it if you are more advanced. Land with your body in a hovering push up position, keeping your weight as evenly distributed as possible.
Engage your arms so they are close to your sides, forming a 90 degree angle with your upper arms.

, From four legged staff pose, roll over your toes into upward facing dog. You can also set your feet on the ground if rolling is not possible. Engage your back muscles, open your chest, and look up as the tops of your feet rest on the ground. Upward dog easily transitions you into the final position, downward facing dog.Engage your thighs to help you safely and effectively stay in upward facing dog. Pulling your tailbone towards your heels can also protect your back. Press your palms fully into the floor.

, Breathe and roll back over your toes into downward dog. You can also step into downward dog if your toes can’t roll into the pose. Your body should look like an inverted “V” shape. This is the final position in sun salutations.Relax your shoulders and roll your arms inward so the inside of your elbows are facing. Lift your sitting bones towards the ceiling. Keep your palms pressed flat against the floor.Allow your heels to fall where they want. Your heels may not touch the floor, depending on the flexibility in your lower back, hamstrings, and calf muscles. The more you do yoga, the easier it will be to get your heels to the ground.

, In order to get the most out of your sun salutations, repeat the sequence for 10-12 rounds. Beginners may only want to do 3-5 rounds. If you are short on time, practice sun salutations for 10 minutes. Repeating your sun salutations will boost your energy as well as strengthen and stretch your body and mind.Choose to do quick transitions between poses for more cardio benefit. You can also do a slower and more meditative sequence of sun salutations. This can stretch you out more than quickly progressing through poses.

Add new poses after your sun salutations.,
Add standing poses.,
Perform inversions and backbends.,
Finish with seated postures.,
End your practice in savasana.",How to Complement Cardio with Yoga3," You may want to try yoga poses beyond sun salutations. Choosing poses from the four groups of asanas that complement your cardio can bring you maximum benefits. Remember that you can have an effective yoga practice with just a few poses. Incorporating and mastering different poses can also help you put together a stimulating practice that won’t feel like a routine.Start with easier poses and then try more difficult ones after you master basic ones.

Understand the purpose of eye focus, or drishti, in yoga.,
Practice eye focus in standing yoga poses.,
Try to maintain your drishti in balancing yoga postures.",How to Balance in Yoga Poses1," Ancient yogis developed the technique of drishti by noting that when you are in a pose, your attention usually follows where you place your eyes or your gaze. When you fix your gaze or drishti on a certain, single point, your mind can block out distractions or external objects and you can be fully present in a pose. Focusing your drishti can allow your mind to go into a deep state of concentration, thereby allowing you to remain still and calm. There eight specific drishtis, or eye focus points, in yoga. Each drishti is suggested for different yoga poses to enhance your focus and balance.Nasagrai Drishti: This is when you focus your gaze at the tip of your nose. Doing Nasagrai Drishti when you are in Upward Facing Dog or Standing Forward Fold pose can help you maintain proper alignment and balance.
Angusta Ma Dyai Drishti: This is when you focus your eyes on your thumbs, such as in Warrior I Pose or Eagle Pose.
Nabi Chakra Drishti: This is when you fix your gaze at your navel, such as in Downward Facing Dog.
Pahayoragrai Drishti: This is when you gaze at your toes, such as in seated forward bends or any standing twist poses.
Hastagrai Drishti: This is when you gaze at your hands, such as in Triangle Pose and Warrior II Pose.
Parva Drishti: This is when you focus your eyes to one side, such as in a seated spinal twist.
Urdhva Drishti: This is when you gaze upwards, towards the sky or ceiling. This drishti is used in Warrior Side Angle Pose, Balancing Half Moon, and Prayer Twist.
Naitrayohmadya Drishti: This is when your gaze comes from your third eye or the middle of your forehead, rather than your eyes. This drishti is used in Fish Pose, Upward Forward Fold Pose, and Reverse Warrior II Pose.;
, It is important that when you focus your drishti in a yoga pose, you do not strain your eyes. Keep your eye muscles relaxed and your gaze soft. You can try to focus your gaze when in standing yoga postures that require balance, such as Warrior Pose, Triangle Pose, and Mountain Pose.In Warrior Pose and Triangle Pose, your drishti should be focused on your hand, known as Hastagrai Drishti. In Warrior Pose, this means focusing your gaze on the hand in front of you and in Triangle Pose, this means focusing your gaze upward, at the hand that is pointed towards the ceiling.
In Mountain Pose, you should keep your drishti straight ahead at an unmoving spot in front of you.

, When you are in balancing yoga postures like Tree Pose, Half Moon Pose, and Dancer Pose, it can help to keep your drishti focused on a specific part of your body or on an unmoving spot in front of you. As well, when you are in arm balancing poses like Crow Pose, Side Plank Pose, and Four Limbed Staff Pose, your drishti or gazing point is very important, as you need to be calm and focused in these poses to remain balanced in them.In Tree Pose, your drishti should be fixed on an unmoving spot in front of you or up towards your hands, also known as Hastagrai Drishti.
In Half Moon Pose and Dancer Pose, your drishti should be focused towards the ceiling, also known as Urdhva Drishti.
In arm balances like Crow Pose or Four Limbed Staff Pose, your gaze should be fixed on an unmoving spot just ahead of you.

Allow the anger to be there.",How to Use Yoga for Anger Management," Practicing yoga regularly will go a long way toward helping you manage your anger long term. If you have a particularly hostile or irritable personality type, practicing regularly will help reinforce the short term benefits from merely practicing a pose once or twice or going to a class once. You need not go to a class to practice basic yoga, but you might want to go to a class in order to learn more advanced poses.Try to go to class or practice a routine at least three times a week.Practice for an hour to an hour and a half when possible. If you can't, even 10 to 20 minutes of yoga at a time can bring down stress levels.;
, Sometimes it can be helpful for beginners to practice yogas with other to get the hang of the types of routines they can try. It is also helpful to assuaging anger if you are feeling the support of the group when practicing yoga. However, if you have a competitive personality, practicing in a group might undermine your efforts., For beginners and more advanced students, watching videos can help you develop a practice as they often include routines that last anywhere from 5 minutes to an hour or more. There are plenty of yogis out there with different styles such as Adriene of the YouTube channel ""Yoga with Adriene"" which is calm but cheerful, or more exercise focused like Brian Jones of the YouTube channel ""Muscle and Mat"".Adriene even has a video that demonstrates yoga for when you feel angry., Focus on the breath is a central part of yoga practice. It is essential to focus on your breath to get the most out of the yoga poses you are trying. The deeper the breath the better. Take your time, and continue the exercise until you feel calmer., Keeping a yoga journal allows you to see over time how yoga is affecting your overall anger. It can also be a place to document the pleasures and frustrations of yoga after your regular practice.In addition, writing can reduce the intensity of your anger., With the corpse pose, you lie on your back with your palms up, arms at your side. Then you relax each part of your body in turn. While doing all of this, focus on your breathing. Breathe deeply into your belly. This is a pose that is best done with your eyes closed or relaxed., The cooling breath is an excellent way to address anger.You simply roll your tongue (curling in the edges) or purse your lips if you can’t roll your tongue, and inhale slowly through your mouth so that the breath comes through your rolled up tongue. Then, close your mouth and exhale through your nose. This practice is thought to reduce anger and improve focus., This pose was thought to wring out anger by early Buddhist monks. It massages the internal organs and stretches your spine.You can accomplish pose by sitting with both legs ahead of you then bending one knee up while bending the other on the ground underneath the other leg. You then twist your spine toward the side where the knee is up and use the knee as a rest for your arm as you stretch further into the pose. Don’t push yourself. If you feel pain, relax a bit., This pose has been shown to improve confidence in people with hostile or irritable personality types, as well as reduce anger. While there are several ways to achieve a backbend in yoga, the Upward Bow pose is the most common, as it is what people usually think of when they think of back bends. This is a somewhat advanced pose, and you may do well to learn it with a qualified yoga instructor.Use caution in this pose, as this is a pose that can put pressure on the neck which can be hazardous for many individuals.
Use modifications on this pose if this is difficult! The same benefit can be gotten from Plow Pose with supports as directed by a qualified instructor as without.

, It can help stabilize the nervous system, helping people who struggle with anger issues or who have a hostile personality to reduce their anger and irritability. It builds strength and flexibility, and helps the thyroid and parathyroid glands., Breathing has long been a central part of yoga.

Focusing on your breath before, during, and after yoga sessions will greatly benefit anger management. Breathing deeply is also good for other negative emotions, as it physiologically calms you down. Make sure to breathe deep into your diaphragm. You should be able to feel/see your belly rise and fall while doing this.Breathe out slowly. The time taken to breathe out is approximately four times the time taken to breathe in.

, Take time to relax your muscles from head to toe, one by one. This will help release tension in parts of your body you may not have realized were even there. Don’t rush. Take your time.If you feel like you are having trouble slowing down, then you can also do a guided body scan meditation that will take you through all the parts of your body., This is not about thinking about the anger. Rather you just need to stay with the emotion. Feel all of it. Notice where you feel it in your body. Notice the intensity. Don’t judge the feelings. If thoughts do arise, acknowledge them and then return to noticing your emotions., Stay with it as long as you need to. Eventually, with all the mindful noticing, the anger will begin to dissipate. If it begins to dissipate, don’t fight it. Instead, try to let it go.Try focusing on your breathing instead of focusing on what you are angry about."

Be aware of the benefits of deep breathing techniques.,
Understand how to practice deep breathing.,
Focus on deep breathing throughout your yoga practice.",How to Balance in Yoga Poses2," In yoga, deep breathing is essential to a strong practice. Whenever you are practicing yoga, you should also be practicing deep, conscious breathing to get the full benefit of the postures. Deep breathing is referred to as Pranayama in yoga, which translates to “life force control”.There are numerous physical, mental, and emotional benefits to practicing Pranayama. Deep breathing will ensure all your vital organs, including your brain, are getting the oxygen they need. It will also nourishes your muscles and organs and can help your body to rid itself of toxins.
As well, Pranayama has been shown to improve mental concentration and reduce stress. When you are practicing Pranayama as you do yoga, you are that much closer to entering a meditative state. Maintaining focus on your breathing can also help you to maintain your balance during your yoga practice.

, To do Pranayama, you will need to activate your breath in your diaphragm and focus on having full inhales and exhales through your nose.Start in a comfortable cross legged position. Put your hands on your diaphragm, just below your ribs. Inhale slowly through your nose, breathing from your abdominal area. Feel your diaphragm expand as you inhale and try to make a whooshing sound.
Inhale deeply for a count of four.
Exhale slowly through your nose to the count of four. Feel your diaphragm contract as you exhale. Make a whooshing sound as you exhale through your nose. Imagine you are trying to fog up a mirror in front of you with your breath.
Pause once your lungs are empty at the end of your exhale. Repeat the breathing cycle again. Breathe in and out through your nose. Make a whooshing sound as you breathe in and out. You should feel your diaphragm expand and contract as you breathe.

, The mantra in yoga is often: “one breath, one movement”. This means that each time you move in yoga, you should be breathing in or breathing out. Timing your yoga practice to your breath will ensure you are always breathing properly when you are in a pose and you are focusing on your breath and your movement, nothing else.Try timing a sun salutation to your breath so you can practice deep breathing as you do yoga. Breath in as you raise your arms up in Mountain Pose, and then breath out as you dive forward into a Standing Forward Fold. You should then inhale as you look in front of your toes and straighten your spine and then exhale as you place your feet behind you and lower yourself down in Plank Pose.
Inhale as you rise up into Upward Facing Dog and exhale as you move back into Downward Facing Dog. Inhale as you bend your knees and exhale as you step your feet forward so they are together at the top of your mat. Inhale as you look forward and straighten your spine and exhale as you fold down into a Standing Forward Fold. Inhale as you rise up back into Mountain Pose and exhale as you end the sun salutation in Standing Prayer Pose.
Once you feel comfortable timing your breath to the movements in a sun salutation, extend your deep breathing to standing poses and balancing poses. Make sure you always breath in as you lift your body and breath out as you lower your body. When you hold balancing postures, you should maintain an even breathing cycle to ensure you are focused and calm.

Check your alignment in standing poses.,
Note your alignment in balancing poses.,
Make sure you have proper alignment in seated postures.",How to Balance in Yoga Poses3," To improve your balance in standing poses, you should ensure your body is aligned properly. Stacking your body so your shoulders and hips are in line with your feet will help you to maintain an even center of gravity and feel grounded.When you are in any standing poses, you should always begin with your feet hip distance apart and your toes spread wide on your mat. If you cannot spread your toes, bend down and use your fingers to manually push them apart so there is space between them. You confine your feet to shoes and socks all day, so they may not be used to stretching apart.
Note where your weight is distributed when you are standing straight. Make sure the weight is equal on your feet and avoid putting your full weight into your heels on into the balls of your feet. Try to lift the arches on your feet so your feet are active and the muscles in your feet are working.
From your feet, move up your body, activating each muscle. Make sure your leg muscles are activated, as well as your abdominal and core muscles. Try to tuck your tailbone towards the ground so your hips are square and level with your shoulders. Having even weight distribution and activated muscles when you are in standing postures will help you to maintain your center of gravity and feel you are on solid ground.

, When you are in balancing postures like Tree Pose and Big Toe Pose, your alignment is essential to maintaining your balance. You should make sure you have a firm grounding in your standing leg and your hips are level as you go into either pose. Putting weight in your standing leg will ensure you have a solid foundation in the pose.As well, when doing arm balance poses like Crow Pose and Four Limbed Staff Pose, it is very important that your alignment is correct. Rather than spread your toes apart, you should spread your fingers apart and make sure your weight is distributed evenly on your hands. You should press your palm to the ground so your hands are rooted in the ground. This will give you a solid foundation when you balance on your arms in yoga poses.

, Though you likely will not lose your balance easily in seated postures, you can deepen your yoga practice by making sure your foundation is strong when in seated postures like Seated Twist or Seated Forward Fold.Do this by connecting your sitz bones with the ground or with your mat. You will need to pull the flesh from under your butt and tilt your pelvis forward so you can feel your sitz bones on the ground. This will ensure you have the correct alignment when going into seated folds or twists and you do not have unequal weight distribution on either side of your body.

Use a yoga block to help you stay balanced.,
Try using a yoga strap to maintain your balance, especially in standing poses.,
Do partner yoga to improve your balance.",How to Balance in Yoga Poses4," You can buy yoga blocks are your local yoga studio, online, or at sporting goods stores. These blocks are often made of cork or foam and can be very useful for beginner yogis who want to work on improving their balance, flexibility, and alignment.Think of the yoga block as a support in your practice that you can use in balancing postures to deepen your stance in the pose or to help you remain grounded in the pose. You can use yoga blocks when doing Half Moon Pose, for example, by placing your bottom hand on the block to give you extra support and to help you maintain proper alignment.
You can also use yoga blocks when forward folding or twisting to help improve your flexibility and allow you to deepen your stretch without having to worry about falling or slipping.

, Yoga straps are great for improving your flexibility and providing support when you want to go deeper in a pose. You can buy a yoga strap at your local yoga studio or at sporting goods stores. Most yoga straps are made of woven material that is made to withstand tugging and pulling.Standing balance postures like Dancer Pose can be difficult for people with limited flexibility. You can enhance this pose by wrapping a yoga strap around your lifted foot and holding the strap in your opposite hand. This will allow you to access the full expression of the pose without straining yourself or worrying about being thrown off balance.

, If you are interested in practicing yoga with others and are looking for an interactive way to improve your balance and flexibility, consider taking a partner yoga class. Partner yoga is a good way to practice certain poses with someone else acting as a safety net or a support. You can do many poses, from Wheel Pose to Forward Fold, with a partner in a partner yoga class, without the fear of falling over or losing your balance.


If you are a more experienced practitioner, you can try an AcroYoga class, where you use the support of a partner, as well as a spotter, to balance on the body of your partner. AcroYoga is considered more advanced and should always be done in the safety of a class with a certified yoga instructor."

Begin on all fours.,
Exhale and push back to child’s pose.,
Hinge forward to plank pose.,
Drop down to your forearms if desired.,
Return to child’s pose.,
Try advanced plank poses.,
Finish your plank practice.",How to Perform the Plank Exercise1," If you are new to yoga or not especially flexible, prepare yourself to perform plank pose by starting on all fours. Make sure that you will be comfortable by using a yoga mat. You may also place a folded up blanket under your knees if you need some extra padding for your knees.


Make sure your hands are directly beneath your shoulders and your knees directly beneath your hips.The tops of your feet can either be flat on the floor or you can curl your toes if you choose.Inhale and exhale evenly through your nose. If you can, make a slight sound like the sea when you breathe. This is called ujayyi breathing and can help you flow through your routine more effectively.;
, To do child’s pose, or balasana, remain on your hands and knees and move your bottom back towards your feet. Allow your thighs to spread out to the same width as your shoulders as you do this and sink your chest towards the mat. Your hand should stay out in front of you with your palms on the yoga mat.








Stretch your arms and head forward and breathe through this pose.
You can rest your forehead on the mat as well.
Allow your shoulder to relax and release as you sink deeper into the stretch.
Hold this pose for about five breaths or for as long as you like.

, When you are ready, push your body up from child's pose and back onto your hands and knees. Then, move into a plank pose, or kumbhakasana.Position your shoulders over your hands and straighten your legs as you rise up onto the balls of your feet. When you are in position, you should look like you are preparing to do a push up.








Make sure to keep your abs engaged and spine long. Don’t pop your bum up.Your feet should be hip width apart and flexed with your heels pushing backwards for extra stability.Keep your elbows close to your ribs, and pull your shoulders down and away from your head to keep them from collapsing, which will lengthen your neck., You can stay up on the palms of your hands if you want, or you can drop down onto your forearms to make the plank a little more challenging. This variation is called the dolphin plank pose.








Make sure to keep your spine straight and your bottom down, as with the regular plank pose. Direct your face and eyes towards the floor as you hold the pose.
Breathe for three to five breaths as you hold this pose.
When you are finished holding your dolphin plank, get back onto your hands and knees so that you can move into child's pose. You can either drop down onto your stomach and then rise up onto your hands and knees, or you can move back up into a plank on your palms and then get onto your hands and knees.

, After you’ve stayed in plank for three to five breaths, exhale, get onto your hands and knees, and then hinge back to child’s pose. Give your body a chance to rest in child’s pose for a few breaths before you proceed with any further poses.








Inhale and exhale steadily for as many breaths as you like.
You can do another plank after you finish with child's pose, or finish your practice here.

, Once you've mastered the full plank, you can challenge yourself with more difficult variations.Don't progress to these until you are strong enough to keep your body straight and stable throughout the entire movement.









Do a single leg plank by slowly lifting one foot at a time off the ground. Then, lower that leg after a few breaths and repeat on the other side.
Do a single arm plank by slowly reaching one arm out in front of you. After a few breaths, lower that arm and repeat with the other arm. Make sure your hips remain stable and don’t rock from side to side.

, After you’ve done a few rounds of plank pose, finish your practice. From the plank pose, gently lower your knees to the floor. Then, transition into child’s pose again and breathe. Take three to five breaths in child’s pose to complete your routine.









If you want some extra rest, stay in child’s pose for longer.

Take a beginner class in Hatha Yoga or Vinyasa Yoga.,
Try an Ashtanga or Power Yoga class if you want to try a little bit more of an advanced class.,
Take Iyengar yoga to focus on poses for longer periods of time.,
Take a richly detoxifying Bikram Yoga or Hot Yoga class.,
Wear a tank top to yoga.,
Wear a sports bra to a Bikram class.,
Try a t-shirt.,
Experiment with layers.,
Use your swimsuit.,
Wear yoga pants.,
Try bicycle shorts.,
Wear ordinary, loose fitting shorts.,
Choose a pair of leggings.,
Remember to bring a headband or hair tie.,
Pick up a pair of yoga gloves.,
Get a pair of yoga socks.,
A towel is never a bad idea.,
Invest in a yoga mat.,
Buy a yoga bag or strap for your mat.",How to Know What to Wear for Yoga," Many beginner-level classes will either be Hatha or Vinyasa. Both are focused on coordinating movement with breath. Vinyasa is a little faster-paced and will involve more intense stretching, leg lifting and inversions. The more advanced these classes, the more they will challenge even a regular yogi.;
, These classes involve constant movement between poses, making them slightly more challenging.

, Many poses will be held for a long time, giving you a chance to find your balance and appreciate the benefit of the stretch. This form of yoga often calls for props such as blocks, blankets, or straps (which are usually on hand at the studio; you won’t need to bring your own).

, The rooms are heated to approximately 100 degrees (37ºC) in order to induce sweating, which is thought to be cleansing. The heat also encourages relaxing of muscles, which leads to much deeper stretches.

, Some of the most basic yoga poses involve lots of arm movement. If you don’t have any sleeves, you won’t have to worry about constantly pushing them out of your way and can focus instead on your poses.


Chose one that doesn’t have a plunging neckline and fits your body well—a loose shirt or a low neckline will leave you exposed when you bend or twist into a new position.

, During Bikram or Hot yoga, you will get extremely warm. Women may want to opt for a sports bra in order to stay cool. Sports bras are typically categorized by impact level; a low-impact bra is fine. For men, going shirtless to Bikram is an option.

, Pick one that is comfortable and fits well. Practice stretching, reaching, and bending your arms to make sure the shirt is not too tight.


In inversion poses, your shirt might slide up your torso, so either prepare to tuck it in during class, or wear a camisole underneath.

, For a more mellow class like Iyengar or Vinyasa, you may want to wear a lightweight sweatshirt over a tank top so you’ll be warm at the beginning and end of class when there is less movement. You can always remove layers if you get too hot.

, During summer, if you're doing yoga outdoors, a swimsuit is perfectly acceptable provided you're comfortable wearing it.

, Yoga pants are easy to find at most stores that carry workout clothes. They come in many different colors so you can pick whatever suits your personality. Try some lunges or stretches in the dressing room to make sure you have a full range of motion. You can also wear them for other fitness activities, like running or biking.


Full-length yoga pants are better suited for classes that won’t involve a lot of rapid movement since the excess fabric could trip you up.
For more active classes where you’ll get hotter much quicker, consider getting a 3/4-length pair of yoga pants.
The styles vary from pencil-leg to bell-bottoms. There are also more loose-fitting styles that resemble lightweight sweatpants. Consider which styles will make you feel most comfortable since you want to be able to work through your poses without worrying at all about the way you look.

, Again, at a Bikram class, less is more; you might not want your entire legs covered. Bicycle shorts are great for yoga because they stay put as you move.


You’ll also want to consider whether they are transparent when stretched, but you want to be secure that you will be well-concealed throughout the class.
If you’re going to be sweating a lot in your shorts, consider black or navy blue colors that tend to show moisture less readily.

, If you have a favorite pair of shorts that moves with you as you do, they might be perfect for yoga.

, You might already have leggings in your closet. Just make sure you choose an opaque pair!


If you haven’t tried yoga before and are tentative about investing in a new wardrobe before you know whether you’ll go to classes regularly, a pair of leggings is fine. But you will want to get some pants properly designed for yoga if you perform it more often because the way yoga clothes are tailored lend themselves well to getting into flexible poses comfortably and without restriction.

, Keeping your hair out your face is always important when exercising. If your hair is too short to tie back, a headband will help keep it off your forehead and out of your eyes.

, While they certainly don’t look chic, yoga gloves are very useful. Their skid-proof palms give you a bit more gripping power and prevent your hands from slipping on the mat. They are fairly inexpensive and can be found at yoga clothing stores and sometimes health food stores.

, These will help you avoid from slipping on your mat, which can get very frustrating, particularly in hot or higher-intensity classes.

, Yoga class can get awfully sweaty, so you might be glad you brought a towel. You can also lay your towel down on your mat to help keep your hands from slipping—a good option if you don’t like yoga gloves.

, Mats can be pricey, but it’s nice to have your own if you want to practice at home or if you have issues with using someone else’s mat.


If you’re not sure if yoga is for you and just want to try it out, most studios have mats available to rent.
Mats vary in thickness, so if you have tender knees or want more support for when you’re sitting on the firm ground, consider the option of buying a thicker mat.

, Having one of these makes it easier to move around with your mat since you can carry it over your shoulder. It’s also a great way to keep your mat from unraveling when you’re not using it.

Cycle back through this vinyasa and return to mountain pose.",How to Perform Downward Facing Dog in Yoga1," Start by standing in tadasana, or mountain pose, at the front of a yoga mat. This will allow you to most easily flow into downward facing dog from a standing position.









In tadasana, or mountain pose, you stand at the front of a yoga mat with your feet together and your arms at your sides. Gaze forward, spread your toes, and make sure your balance is evenly distributed between both feet.Make sure to engage your abdominals and lightly pull your sacrum toward the ground.

, No yoga practice, even if it is just doing downward facing dog, is complete without setting an intention. By taking a few seconds to dedicate your practice to something, you may be more effective at doing downward facing dog.









Lightly touch the bases of your palms, then the palms themselves, and finally your fingers to make prayer hands. You can leave a small space between your palms if you like to let energy flow. Place your prayer hands on your sternum, near your heart.

, Exhale and “plunge” into standing forward bend, which is also called uttanasana.








It’s important to keep your back straight and hinge forward at your waist as you transition from upward salute (urdhva hastasana) to standing forward bend (uttanasana).
Plant your palms flat on the floor next to either foot. Your fingers should point forward and be fully spread apart so that your entire palm is pressing into the floor, which will help distribute your weight evenly between your hands and your feet.
It’s important to keep your abs engaged and in contact with your thighs.If necessary, bend your knees to keep this contact.
If your palms don’t reach the floor, put them on blocks so that your entire hand is pressing into the floor., Gently inhale and extend your spine into a standing half forward bend, which is also called ardha uttanasana. This position will make it easier for you to enter downward facing dog.









Make sure to keep your spine straight as you extend halfway upward. Keep your palms firmly planted on the floor next to your feet.Make sure to keep your abs engaged while you’re in this position., Depending on how experienced you are at yoga either step or jump back into Adho Mukha Dandasana. This will be your preparatory pose before completing the vinyasa to adho mukha savasana or downward facing dog.








, If you are a beginner yogi, first step your right foot back followed by your left. Your body will end up in an inverted “V” shape, which is downward facing dog or adho mukha savasana. This position should feel calming and allow you to rest as you get deeper into the asana, or pose.

Make sure that you are on a yoga mat to make the position more comfortable. You can also place a folded blanket under your knees for some extra padding.


Position your hands directly beneath your shoulders and your knees directly beneath your hips.Take a few breaths and hold this position.

, Keeping your hands in the same place, push your seat back towards your heels. Keep your hands palms down on the mat in front of you. This position is called child’s pose, which is also known as balasana.Stay in this position for three to five breaths.

, From child’s pose, inhale and hinge forward at your hips back onto your hands and knees. Then, get into a regular plank pose, or kumbhakasana.Take a few breaths and hold this position.

If you don’t know much about yoga, or if it has been a long time since you have been to a yoga class, try attending one or two classes. This can help you develop a yoga regimen for your home practice.After the class, write down the asanas, or poses, so that you remember what you did. Don’t be afraid to draw pictures if that makes it easier to recall the asanas.
Ask the instructor if they have any tips or suggestions for a home practice. Many instructors will be encouraging and will understand if you can’t make it to class frequently.;
, There are a wide variety of video-based yoga courses available. You may consider purchasing yoga DVDs for your home practice, which will offer a basic guided yoga practice for you to follow. You may also search online for yoga videos or courses that guide you through increasingly complex yoga practice.


Select a video or course that corresponds with your personal yoga goals.If your goal is to burn fat and lose weight, you might want to find a fast-paced vinyasa or ashtanga video.If your goals are meditation and mindfulness, you may want to find a Hatha yoga video.Restorative and yin yoga are specifically practiced to help stretch out and repair muscles.Feel free to mute the video once you have done it a few times. You might want to glance at it occasionally for guidance, but you can always play your own music and turn your attention inward.

, There are many great resources online for putting together a home yoga practice. You can research such topics as different asanas and how to sequence them into a solid practice.Make sure to consult sites that are supported by certified yoga instructors. Many forms of yoga such as Ashtanga, Jivamukti, Hatha, and Iyengar have their own organizational websites that can help you develop your home practice.

, It sounds easy enough to simply practice yoga at home, but be aware that it can be quite difficult, especially if you are not a experienced yogi.Understanding the fundamentals of yoga from asana alignment to proper sequencing of asanas can help you set a successful and injury-free home practice.








When yoga is done properly, it appears effortless and should feel relatively effortless. You want to challenge your body and mind to constantly improve, even if it is only something as minimal as getting deeper into a position or mastering an asana.If you’re just starting out, it’s advisable to practice using DVDs or online resources until you feel comfortable putting together a solid and independent home practice.Understand that it takes a good yoga teacher many years of practice and instructing to put together classes that incorporate all of the elements of a yoga practice.

, Before initiating any yoga practice, it’s advisable to figure out why you want to practice. Yoga can be a method of physical exercise, a way to reduce and manage stress, a means of healing an illness or injury, or a path to spiritual fulfillment and peace.









Think about which components of wellness you want to work on, such as strength, flexibility, stamina, anxiety, and depression. You might also want to practice for your general well-being.
Consider writing down your goals for your practice. Update your goals as you meet them and add new goals to keep yourself challenged.For example, you could have a goal such as “get my heels to the ground in downward dog” or “I want to master supported headstand.”

, At a minimum, you will need a yoga mat. Consider having props such as a yoga belt, yoga block, and a large blanket or bolster at hand, too.These pieces of equipment can help improve and deepen your yoga practice as well as making it more comfortable.You can buy mats and props at sporting goods stores, yoga studios, or at online yoga retailers.
You don’t necessarily need special yoga clothing, but try wearing something comfortable that isn’t too tight. Women can wear leggings, a tank top, and sports bra. Men can wear a pair of athletic shorts and a t-shirt.

, Scheduling regular yoga sessions can help you maintain your practice and keep other people used to giving you time and space. Gradually work up to practicing yoga every day.









Start your home practice with one to three sessions per week and then build up towards doing yoga every day. Set goals for yourself that are attainable.

, Make sure all that electronics are turned off or unplugged, no one is coming over, and everyone in your household is either not home or otherwise occupied. Be clear to everyone that your yoga practice that is for you and you should not be disturbed except in an emergency.Many yoga classes are 60-95 minutes, but you may not be able to make that much time. Even if you only have 10 minutes per day, you can still reap the benefits of yoga.If you have children, try to find someone to watch them while you do your yoga practice. You could also do yoga during their naps or even consider inviting the kids do yoga with you!
Even if you only have 10 minutes per day, you can still reap the benefits of yoga., You’ll want to have a comfortable and quiet space in which to practice yoga. Make sure you’ve got plenty of room to move and a way to close yourself off to the outside world, such as a door to a room.You’ll need a few inches on each side of your mat so that you don’t run into a wall or anything else.
Make sure the place you practice is quiet and calm so that no one can disturb your focus. You’ll also want someplace that is comfortable: a humid and chilly basement may not be the best option, for example.

, “Sequencing,” or putting together asanas that make up a yoga practice, is one of the most difficult parts of practicing yoga, especially if you are doing it at home. Regardless of how you learn to approach yoga, there is a basic sequence that most yoga classes follow.








Start your practice with a short meditation and chanting exercise to calm your mind and center your thoughts.Set an intention for your practice just before you begin to practice.After meditating and setting your intention for your practice, warm up with floor poses.Move from a warm up of sun salutations to standing poses, then progress through inversions, backbends, forward bends, and end with savasana, or corpse pose.Always end your practice with a final relaxation pose.

, Chanting mantra is a good way to get into the right mindset to practice yoga. Even a small amount of mantra chanting can have significant benefits on the mind and body.









Consider starting your chant with an aum, which is the most elemental sound.
As you chant, you should feel mantra’s vibrations in your lower belly. If you can’t feel this sensation, try sitting up straighter.
You can choose other mantras as well. Maha mantra, which is also called either the great mantra or Hare Krishna, can help you achieve salvation and peace of mind. Repeat the entire mantra as many times as you like. It’s words are: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

, Chanting itself can be a form of meditation, or you can choose to transition from meditation to a silent meditation. Either way you choose, you will reap the benefits of a mantra meditation practice.


Just allow your body to flow with what it wants. There are times when you may want to continue chanting or other times when you will want to meditate silently. The point is to not force your body.
Let your thoughts come and whenever they arise. This will teach you to focus and let go of anything you can’t control.
Any time you need to refocus your mind, you can repeat “let” with every inhalation and “go” with every exhalation.
Meditation takes consistent practice and is an important part of yoga. You will have good days and bad days and accepting this is part of the journey.

, No yoga practice is complete without setting an intention. By taking a few seconds to dedicate your practice to something, you may be more effective at doing sun salutations.


Lightly touch the bases of your palms, then the palms themselves, and finally your fingers to make prayer hands. You can leave a small space between your palms if you like to let energy flow.
If you don’t know what your intention is, consider something as simple as “letting go.”

, Yoga is an active practice, so it is important to warm up your body properly. Doing a few rounds of sun salutations, or Surya Namaskar, can effectively prepare your muscles and mind to practice.








There are three different variations of sun salutations. Consider doing 2-3 rounds of Surya Namaskar A, B, and C to warm up. These different sun salutations will engage and condition your muscles for a safe and more pliable bakasana., You do not have to be able to do every yoga asana in existence to have an effective home practice. Incorporating and mastering a few simple poses from each of the four types of asana can help you put together a solid home practice.








Make sure to start with easier asanas and move on to more difficult poses as you master basic ones.Do asanas from each type of pose in the following order: standing poses, inversions, backbends, and forward bends.Add a twisting asana to neutralize and stretch your spine between backbends and forward bends if you like.Hold each asana for 3-5 breaths.Always balance out asanas that favor one side by doing them on the opposite side., After you’ve warmed up with sun salutations, do one or two standing asanas, or postures, to start. From mountain pose to the warrior series, these asanas build strength, stamina and flexibility in your entire body.








Always begin any yoga practice in tadasana, or mountain pose.Add other foundational standing poses such as vrksasna (tree pose) or the Warrior Series, which is known as Virabhadrasana I, II, and III.As you progress, you can incorporate other standing poses such as Utthita Trikonasana (Extended Triangle Pose) and Parivrtta Trikonasana (Revolved Triangle Pose)., Inversions may sound daunting, but they are an integral part of any yoga practice.From handstand to headstand, these asanas can calm your circulation and stimulate your nervous system while building strength.








If you are a beginner, it’s important to get the help of a professional before you try these asanas. This can help ensure that you enter the postures properly and don’t injure yourself.You can practice handstands, which is known as mukha vrksasana, on a wall until you have enough strength to hold yourself up.Gradually add forearm balance and salamba sirsasana (headstand) as your practice improves.Never jump into any inversion. Too much momentum can lead to injury., Together with inversions, backbends are the most intense portion of any asana practice. From cobra pose to full wheel, backbends will strengthen the back and stretch the abs while counterbalancing the effects of sitting in a chair.








Begin with simple backbends such as salabhasana (locust pose), bhujangasana (cobra pose), or setu bandha sarvangasana (bridge pose).Work up to dhanurasana (bow pose) and urdhva dhanurasana (full wheel or upward bow)., If you find you your back needs a little help after backbends, add a twist. These asanas will relieve tension and help to balance out your practice in anticipation of forward bends.








Twists can get quite deep, so start off with simple variations such as Bharadvajasana (Bharadvaja’s twist) before moving on to more difficult asanas such as ardha matsyendrasana (half lord of the fishes pose)., Forward bends are always practiced toward the end of a yoga sequence because they calm the mind and the nerves. From head of the knee pose to star pose, forward bends will stretch your back muscles and prepare you for closing postures and final relaxation.








Most people should be able to enjoy the benefits of different forward bends. Try paschimottanasana (seated forward bend), janu sirsasana (heat of the knee pose), or tarasana (star pose) and hold them each for 8-10 balanced breaths., Closing postures will end your active asana practice. From supported shoulder stand to corpse pose, these poses will quiet your mind and relax your body.








A good sequence to follow for closing postures is holding salamba sarvangasana (supported shoulderstand) and then immediately entering matsyasana (fish pose).If you cannot do salamba sarvangasana, try viparita karani (legs up the wall pose).If you haven’t done headstand already and are able, consider adding this as your final active posture. It complements supported shoulder stand., You’ve successfully finished your active asana practice and now it’s time to relax. End your practice in savasana (corpse pose) and enjoy the benefits of your yoga session.








Make sure you don’t fall asleep in corpse pose. It’s easy, but with practice you’ll be able to achieve a meditative state in savasana.
If you like, cover yourself up with a blanket or put a bolster under your legs to keep yourself comfortable.

, After you feel comfortable with your established yoga practice, try lengthening your practice by holding each pose a bit longer and flowing seamlessly between asanas. Add new and more challenging poses as you are able.








Many yoga classes are 60-90 minutes, so you could aim to make your practice around that length.

, You may want to strengthen the intensity of your practice as you become comfortable with your routine. This can be done easily by holding each pose a little longer and by challenging yourself to sink deeper into challenging poses.









Poses that involve lunges or squats can be taken a bit lower.
You can increase the speed of transitions between asanas to create more intensity.

, One of the best ways to deepen your yoga practice is to increase the number of days you practice. You can safely build up to 5-7 days per week.If you make yoga a part of your daily routine, its positive effects can benefit your physical and mental health.







, If you started doing yoga with a single goal—to become healthy or to find a mindful way to de-stress—try integrating another purpose into your practice. If you have been focusing on either the body or the mind, try to start focusing on the body and the mind together.









You may want to add chanting or meditation to your practice to help you focus more deeply on your practice.

, Checking in with an instructor in a class once you’re ready to move from beginner to intermediate home practice can be the best way to be sure that you are practicing yoga correctly. Ensuring that you are doing each pose correctly can help prevent any strain or stress in your body.

, Yoga has countless benefits and with a regular practice you can reap them. Keep in mind that yoga is not about whether or not you can do a particular pose exactly like the person on a video or in a picture. It's about the journey towards the pose, enlightenment, or whatever your goal is. Keep an open mind and heart at all times."

Focus on fine-tuning learned positions.,
Be prepared for some aches and bruises.",How to Perform Aerial Yoga," Since Aerial Yoga can be difficult to learn and even dangerous, it may be good to start at a studio and take a learn with a professional before trying it on your own. If you enjoy the class and find that aerial yoga is a good exercise for you,u can now begin doing it on your own.
, Unlike some other sports and workout regimens, aerial yoga requires only one piece of equipment: a strong strip of silk fabric—usually called a swing or hammock—that hangs from the ceiling. When selecting a yoga swing, check out online retailers and sporting good stores to compare prices and brands—a couple to look for are OmGym and Gorilla Gym—before investing. In general, you can get a quality swing for 50 to 150 dollars.Among other things to consider, you should check out handle options on different swings. Some swings are just bare-bones drapes of fabric, but others include one or several sets of plastic or hard handles to use for your hand grips.
Also check the weight capacity of the swings you’re considering buying. Most swings claim a capacity of 300 pounds, but some specialty swings will bear more weight.

, In order to practice aerial yoga effectively and safely, you’ll need to hang your swing from a 4x4 or 2x6 ceiling beam. You’ll also need to place it in an open area of your house or yard—many people prefer using a garage or home gym area—so that you have room to move around. That being said, every swing is different, so be sure to follow the manufacturer’s directions included with your swing.If you aren’t too handy around the house, hire a contractor to assist with swing set-up., Due to the high-friction nature of aerial yoga, you should wear long sleeves and pants when practicing it. After all, armpit and inner thigh skin can be particularly delicate, and you don’t want sharp pinches to keep you from working out.Also be sure to take off any jewelry! Even small earring hoops can get snagged in the swing fabric and cause damage to you and the swing.

, Like regular yoga, aerial yoga can put a lot of pressure on unaccustomed body parts and cause your body to release gas. In order to avoid an upset stomach or uncomfortable gassiness, stay away fizzy drinks for at least two hours before your session.For similar reasons, you’ll probably want to wait at least two hours after mealtime before beginning your session.

, Once you’re a seasoned yoga flyer, you can do your workouts alone. In the meantime, though, you should always practice aerial yoga with someone else. At the very least, have someone in the room so that they can assist if you fall or find yourself in a precarious position.That being said, don’t be afraid of the yoga swing! For most moves, you’ll actually only be about three inches from the ground, so even if you fall off, you won’t have far to go.

, If you’re uncomfortable with trying out aerial yoga at home or you don’t’ have a place where you could hang your hammock, sign up for a class in a local gym or studio. In recent years, several schools of aerial yoga have emerged, including Air Yoga, AntiGravity Aerial Yoga, and Unnata Aerial Yoga.When you find a studio offering aerial yoga, ask about their class offering so that you can find one catering to your level of yoga expertise and general fitness.

, Since your body isn’t used to the motions and pressures entailed in aerial yoga, it’s particularly important that you warm up your muscles before beginning your workout. Get limber and ready by stretching out all the main muscle groups—that is, legs, arms, and core—for at least 15 to 20 minutes.Pay special attention to your shoulders, hands, and arms, as these are put under particular strain during an aerial yoga workout.

, From this position, you can begin to do some of the most basic aerial yoga moves, such as the aerial lunge. You should be standing close enough to the swing that your face touches or almost touches the fabric, and the bottom of the swing’s “U” should hit at pubic bone level.If the swing hits higher or lower than your pubic bone, you should adjust it before mounting the swing.
The aerial lunge improves quad strength and stretches out your hip flexors.

, In order to complete an aerial lunge, you need merely set your right leg into the hammock’s U and bend it so that the swing sits on the lower surface of your leg above the knee. The swing should support your right leg while your left one remains firmly planted on the mat.

, With your arms akimbo, you should lunge forward when inhaling. Keep your left leg planted as before and feel your left quad and hip stretch out.Take care to lunge straight forward rather than leaning to either side. It might be difficult at first, but your balance will improve as you practice.

, Once you’ve leaned forward into lunge position, you should exhale and apply pressure to the hammock with your right leg. This will push you back into the starting position so that you can repeat the aerial lunge again.


Once you’ve repeated this move several times, switch legs and do lunges with the left leg in the hammock.

, Once you’ve got the basic aerial lunge down, you can move on to other fundamental and generally accessible poses. The half boat pose, for example, requires you to rest your lower back in the hammock, lean back, and lift your legs. Holding the pose for five seconds, you'll engage your core and eventually develop core strength and awareness.Other basic aerial poses to try are the child’s pose and downward facing dog. For further guidance, check out a plethora of online video tutorials.

, Like regular yoga, you should strive to improve and perfect all the positions you’ve learned. Seemingly small details, such as foot or hand direction, leg extension, or pointed toes can make a huge difference to the benefit and sustainability of a position. So take care to be mindful of the execution of every pose, even if you feel like it’s getting to be old hat.If you’re having a hard time spotting problems in your technique, consider putting up a big mirror so that you can keep an eye on your workout.

, Aerial yoga is one of the most low-impact, therapeutic workouts you can do, but chances are it won’t be smooth sailing at the start. Since you’re working muscles in ways you haven’t before and putting pressure on unaccustomed joints and skin, you’ll experience some mild to mid-level discomfort during and after your initial workouts.Most people find that aerial yoga workouts get easier and less painful after about two weeks of practicing.

Start in plank pose.,
Open into side plank pose.,
Stretch with the upward facing dog.,
Lower into downward facing dog.,
Transition to chair pose.",How to Flatten Your Abs with Yoga1," If you want to build abdominal strength and flatten your abs with yoga, you must make friends with the plank pose. The plank not only gives your abs a workout – it's a whole-body experience.If you're starting in plank, lay on the floor on your belly with your palms under your shoulders and your legs extended out behind you. Raise up on an inhale so that your arms are perpendicular to the floor. Your wrists should be directly below your shoulders.
Your weight should be evenly supported by your hands and your toes, so that you are one long line of energy from the crown of your head to your heels.
Lengthen your tailbone towards your heels and press the front of your thighs toward the ceiling. Make sure your neck is not crunched and your shoulder blades are down against your back.
Hold this pose for several breaths, then release to the floor. If you find it too difficult to do a full plank, you can drop to your knees for a half plank. Make sure your back is completely flat and not arched.;
, The side plank pose strengthens your entire body, as well as stretching and strengthening your wrists and improving your balance. This balancing pose should not be attempted if you are recovering from a serious wrist, elbow, or shoulder injury.From plank, move to the outside edge of your left foot. Swing your right hip up so that your right leg rolls on top of your left leg, with your right foot on top of your left foot.
Turn your torso to your right, lifting your right hand and placing it on your right hip. Balance your body weight so it is evenly distributed between the outside edge of your left foot and your left hand.
Your left hand shouldn't be directly below your shoulder, but angled a bit. Use your triceps muscle to straighten that arm, pressing into the knuckles of your hand. Your body should be a straight, diagonal line from the crown of your head to your feet.
Hold the pose for a breath or two, then release and do the other side. If you have difficulty maintaining stability in this pose, you might try doing it with your feet against a wall for more support.

, Upward facing dog builds strength in your entire upper body, increasing strength and flexibility in your spine as well as working your chest and abdominal muscles.From plank or side plank, lower to the floor so that you are lying on your stomach with your legs extended behind you. Your toes and the tops of your feet should be on the floor. Place your palms under your shoulders, your arms bent flush along your sides. Lengthen your neck, touching your chin to the floor.
On an inhale, raise your chest up and back, bending your spine. Keep your chest open, shoulders rolling down your back. Make sure your neck is straight and not crunched.
Hold the pose for several breaths, then slowly lower on an exhale. You can create a vinyasa, or flow, with this pose by repeating it five or more times, with a breath for each movement.

, Downward facing dog is typically one of the first yoga poses you learn, and is central to almost any yoga practice. This pose provides stretching and strengthening for your whole body, as well as helping relieve stress.From upward facing dog, come up onto your hands and knees, with your hands just in front of your shoulders. Spread your palms and splay your fingers out wide, pressing into all knuckles. Your knees should be directly under your hips, toes turned under. Spread your feet further apart if you want.
As you exhale, lift your hips upward, pointing your sitting bones to the ceiling. As you inhale, straighten out your legs (or you can leave them bent if it's more comfortable to do so), keeping your heels off the floor.
Stay in a downward facing dog for several breaths. With every inhale, push down through your heels. With every exhale, think of pulling away from the floor towards the ceiling. Make sure your shoulder blades are flat down your back so your shoulders are neutral and your neck isn't crunched.
If you want, you can create a vinyasa flow between upward and downward facing dog, a breath for each movement.

, The chair pose demands tremendous core strength and also helps you gain balance and stability. As you progress with this pose, you'll build the entire core to help flatten your abs.From wherever you are, come to a standing position and bring your legs together so that the inner sides of your feet are touching.
On an exhale, slowly lower your hips as though you are sitting in a chair, keeping your knees over your ankles. Your shins should be perpendicular to the floor.
Hold the pose for 45 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth. If you want a challenge, shift your weight to your heels to further engage your core and bend more deeply. If you can't hold the pose and maintain your breath, don't bend your knees as much.

Stand with both feet together near the top of the mat.,
Step back with your right foot, angling it to your right.,
Sink your butt so that your front knee is directly over your left foot, bent almost to 90-degrees.,
Rotate your upper body so that your hips and shoulders face straight ahead.,
Slightly ""push"" your feet apart from each other on the mat.,
Slowly raise your hands up over your head.,
Deepen the stretch slightly with each exhalation.,
Remember that form is far more important than how far you go -- proper form will make your more flexible while still avoiding injury.,
Inhale and straighten your legs to ease out of the pose.",How to Do the Warrior Pose in Yoga," You want the mat to extend behind you. Your feet should be together, shoulders down, and spine straight. This is also known as Mountain Pose.









This tutorial is for a warrior pose with your left foot forward. To make it left-footed, simply reverse the ""rights"" and ""lefts."";
, Your right toes will point diagonally and to your right, at a roughly 45-degree angle to your left foot, which stays in place and faces forward. You want to step back enough that your back leg is extended and your front knee is slightly bent. Both feet should be firmly planted on the floor.









You can angle the back foot further out (closer to 90-degrees) if you are flexible enough. However, it is more important to keep your whole foot planted.
You can also start with your legs spread wide, so that you face the long side of your mat instead of the front. If you do, rotate your feet into warrior pose (right foot at 45-degrees, left foot facing forward) instead of stepping back.

, Pull your hips slightly towards the floor, bending that front knee. You want the kneecap right over your ankle, keeping your lower leg in a straight line.









You may want to adjust the placement of your back leg to get comfortable. This back knee should be slightly bent, not fully extended.

, They should be in line with your front toes and pointing the same direction. Place your hands on your hips to help you rotate and get your torso ""square,"" or facing directly forward.








, Your feet need to be firm and powerful on the mat. Think of them as trying to rip the mat in half, with each foot pulling the mat in a different direction. If you can't do this, make your stance a bit less wide so you can get your feet well-planted.








, On your next inhale, raise your arms above your head so your palms are facing each other, shoulder-width apart. Gaze straight ahead and focus on the power of the pose.








, As you exhale, relax your body just a bit lower and deeper into the pose. As you drop your tailbone down towards the floor, focus on opening the front of the hips and the pelvic abdomen. Lean your head back and gaze upwards at your fingertips. Stretch upwards through your middle back and arms so that you feel space in your spine, as if stretching it lightly out. Hold this pose for 5-10 breaths.








, While doing the pose, remember to focus on:









Deep, calm breathing
A straight, solid spine.
Shoulders back and chest open, allowing easy breathing.
Keeping your knee over your ankle, not to the sides or out in front.
Holding your chin up, parallel to the floor.

, Contract your muscles while inhaling slowly. Take your time ""undoing"" the pose bit by bit, moving with slow, methodical motions. Lower your arms and bring your legs together again to return to Mountain Pose. Repeat to the other side.

Get the ATIS (Automatic Terminal Information Service) make sure you tell the control tower what happened(if it is an emergency) 10 miles (16 km) out from entry into the airspace.,
Do your pre-landing check with your checklist: Brakes checked, undercarriage down & locked, Mixture fully rich, Fuel selector on both, Flaps as required, (Propeller pitch fixed), Suction indicating, Oil Temps.,
Apply Carb.,
Reach the 45 and contact the tower and tell them how many miles you are out on the 45 and your altitude.,
Remember that when you reach 1⁄4 mile (0.4 km) from the runway, turn downwind.,
Know that when you are abeam the downwind runway numbers, turn on your carburetor heat on, power back to 1500 rpm.,
When the threshold of the runway is 45° behind you, turn left base, and apply another 10 degrees of flaps.,
Turn Final.,
When you are a few feet off the ground, gently power back and level off.,
Complete your post landing checks, then call tower if they have not called you already.

",How to Land a Cessna 172," ATIS will give you a code such as ""Information alpha"" to give to tower. Contact the control tower or approach control for that airport, and state the following:


""tower/approach name, aircraft tail number, location, altitude, Landing with information whatever ""ATIS"" code you received above."" The tower will give you instructions. This guide assumes they instructed you to take left (or right) traffic for Runway X and to report on 45 (45 degree downwind entry to runway being used). (This is a rough guideline, it's missing some specific information that tower sometimes asks for)
;
, and Press. (Ts&Ps) in green, Master on, Mags on both, (Carb. heat to HOT if RPM is below 1500RPM) Hatches & Harness' locked and latched, Landing lights on. PLANE CLEAR TO LAND

, Heat and make your descent to where you reach pattern altitude for that airport by the time you reach the 45° entry leg. You can be a little higher on the 45. Let's assume the pattern altitude is 1,200 feet (365.8 m) MSL. Try to descend at 500 feet per minute. That will be easier on your ear drums.

, The tower might clear you to land or will acknowledge.

, By now the tower should have cleared you to land. You should have slowed the plane to 80 to 85 knots and powered the engine to around 2000 rpms.

, Hold the nose level until the airspeed drops into the white arc, then extend 10 degrees of flaps. Pitch for 75 knots using outside visual reference, then confirm with the airspeed indicator. Make sure you coordinate your turns with the rudder pedals. Be especially careful not to use excessive inside rudder however: skid + stall = spin!

, This should bring your airspeed down to 70 knots. Do not add flaps while in the turn; only after turn is complete. You are now perpendicular to the runway. Be especially careful not to overshoot your final turn at an airport with parallel runways, because the parallel runway might have landing traffic.

, When the field is made (you would reach it even if the engine were to quit), extend the next 10 degrees of flaps (again, after the turn is complete). The spot on the ground where you will land will appear stationary. Use pitch to maintain approach speed (usually 60-70KIAS). Use power to control altitude. Be careful to keep airspeed above 60KIAS, but do not fixate on the airspeed indicator. Use the ailerons to correct for any crosswind and the rudder pedals to keep the plane aligned with the runway center-line.

, Keeping level will require increasing amounts of back pressure on the yoke, and (increasing amounts of aileron in a crosswind). After touchdown keep the yoke pulled all the way back and to whichever side is needed for crosswind. Only apply the brakes if necessary (for field length or to avoid holding up other landing traffic). Continue on the runway centerline until you reach taxi speed (a fast walking pace), then turn off at the nearest taxiway and do not stop until you have passed the hold short line.

It can also stretch your entire body while strengthening your arms, shoulders, and legs. Practicing regularly may aid digestion, and relieve back pain.Talk to your doctor before you begin any yoga practice to make sure you’re healthy enough to practice.Be careful practicing sun salutations if you have any back, arm, or shoulder injuries. Those with motion disorders, including ear infections, should also be careful.;
, Start by standing in tadasana, or mountain pose, at the front of a yoga mat. This will allow you to most easily flow into the sun salutation from standing.Tadasana, or mountain pose, is when you stand at the front of a yoga mat with your feet hip width apart and your arms at your sides. Gaze forward, spread your toes, and make sure your balance is evenly distributed between both feet.Make sure to engage your abdominals and lightly pull your sacrum toward the ground, which is sometimes referred to as engaging your root lock or mula bandha.Inhale and exhale evenly through your nose. If you can, make a slight sound like the sea when you breathe. This is called ujayyi breathing and can help you flow through your downward dog more effectively., No yoga practice is complete without setting an intention. By taking a few seconds to dedicate your practice to something, you may be more effective at doing sun salutations.


Lightly touch the bases of your palms, then the palms themselves, and finally your fingers to make prayer hands. You can leave a small space between your palms if you like to let energy flow.
If you don’t know what your intention is, consider something as simple as “letting go.”

, Once you’ve set your intention, inhale and raise your hands towards the ceiling in an upward salute, which is also called urdhva hastasana.Gently arch your back as you look up towards your hands.


Make sure to completely extend your elbows and reach up through your fingers towards the ceiling. Only tip your head back slightly, making sure not to compress your cervical spine.Do this without hunching your shoulders and make sure to keep your chest and heart area open.You can take a slight backbend in urdhva hastasana, which is easiest to do by simply pulling down your sacrum, or tailbone., Exhale and “plunge” into standing forward bend, which is also called uttanasana.It’s important to keep your back straight and hinge forward at your waist as you transition from upward salute (urdhva hastasana) to standing forward bend (uttanasana). It may help you to remember to keep your heart open.Plant your palms flat on the floor next to either foot. Your fingers should point forward and be fully spread apart so that your entire palm is pressing into the floor, which will make it easier to flow into the following asanas.
It’s important to keep your abs engaged and in contact with your thighs.If necessary, bend your knees to keep this contact.
If your palms don’t reach the floor, put them on blocks so that your entire hand is pressing into the floor., Gently inhale and extend your spine into a standing half forward bend, which is also called ardha uttanasana. This position will make it easier for you to enter the following asanas.


Make sure to keep your spine straight as you extend halfway upward. You’ll also want to keep your palms firmly planted on the floor next to your feet.Make sure to keep your abs engaged while you’re in this position., Depending on how experienced you are at yoga, either step or jump back to four-limbed staff pose, which is called chatturanga dandasana in Sanskrit.This is one of the most challenging positions and sequences in yoga, and may require years of practice to master.


If you are a beginner, you’ll want to step back to downward facing dog and then lower half down to the ground into chatturanga dandasana. Your upper arms should be parallel to the floor.Those who have more experience with yoga can jump back and complete a end up in chatturanga dandasana.Make sure your body is completely even: do not sink your hips or collapse your abdominals. Remaining strong through your core is key to this asana, or exercise. Your upper arms should form a 90 degree angle with the floor and should be close to your side ribs.If you are not strong enough to hold yourself in this position, you can drop your knees to the floor until you build enough strength to support yourself.Your toes should be flexed., From chatturanga dandasana, roll over your toes to an upward facing dog position, or urdhva mukha savasana. This will make it easier to transition to the next and your final position, downward facing dog.Your hands should be in the same position in which they started and the palms should be fully pressing against the floor.Use your flexed toes to roll over on to the backs of your feet. Keep your thighs engaged and off of the floor as you push your chest through your arms. Gently arch your back, open your chest, and look up at the ceiling.Your toes may not be flexible enough to allow you to roll over them. If this is the case, modify the pose by picking up your feet and placing the backs on the floor.Pulling your sacrum towards your heels will protect your back and keep the position from hurting., You’ve reached the final asana and a well-earned rest. Exhale and roll back over your toes so that your body ends up in an inverted “V” shape, which is downward facing dog or adho mukha savasana in Sanskrit. This position should feel calming and allow you to rest as you get deeper into the asana, or pose.Keep your palms pressing flat against the floor and your abs engagedRoll your shoulders down your back and arms inward so the eyes of your elbows are facing one another.Your toes may not be flexible enough to allow you to roll over them. If this is the case, modify the pose by picking up your feet and placing the backs on the floor.
Your heels may or may not touch the floor, depending on how flexible your lower back, hamstrings, and calf muscles are. The more you practice, the easier it will be to get your heels to the floor.Keep lifting your sitting bones towards the ceiling.You can keep your gaze towards your navel, but make sure you’re head is hanging comfortably., In order to finish the sun salutation, you need to end up in tadasana.After five breaths in downward dog, bend your knees to your chest and either jump or step forward into ardha uttanasana, or half standing forward bend.

, Gently inhale and extend your spine back into ardha uttanasana. This position will make it easier for you to re-enter uttanasana.Make sure to keep your abs engaged, spine straight, and palms firmly planted on the floor next to your feet., Hinging forward completely, exhale and fold completely forward into standing forward bend, or uttanasana. You’re almost done with your first round of surya namaskar A!

, You’re ready to come full circle like the sun. Inhale and rise up radiantly by bringing your prayer hands towards the ceiling in urdhva hastasana.Gently arch your back as you look up towards your hands.


Remember to keep your spine straight as you rise into urdhva hastasana., Bring your prayer hands back to your sides as you exhale and return to tadasana. Take a minute or two to enjoy the heart-opening effects and energizing effects of surya namaskar.You can do as many more sun salutations as you like to help yourself warm up.
Consider trying different variations of surya namaskar to help yourself warm up.

Begin with cat/cow.,
Flow into a plank.,
Flow from plank to cobra.,
Energize with downward facing dog.,
Rest in child's pose.",How to Improve Spinal Flexibility with Yoga1," Transitioning between the cat and cow poses is an excellent starting warm-up for your spine that will ease stiffness and get you to articulate your spine better. This yoga exercise also helps you bring awareness to your spine.Get on all fours with your wrists directly below your shoulders and your knees directly below your hips. Your back should be flat. Take a few deep breaths, focusing on each inhale and exhale and connecting your mind and body.
On an inhale, arch your back, lowering your navel towards the floor. Open your chest and lift your head up to gaze forward. Be mindful of your shoulders, keeping your shoulder blades in line with your spine and melting down your back.
On an exhale, drop your tailbone towards the floor and slowly curl your spine outwards, dropping your gaze as you release your chin to your chest. You should end in a position similar to a ""Halloween cat.""
Arch your back when you inhale to return to the cow position. Repeat this exercise for at least five breath cycles, or as long as feels comfortable for you.;
, You may be familiar with the plank pose primarily as an exercise to strengthen your core, but it also warms up your back muscles and provides good preparation for further yoga poses that target spinal flexibility.From all fours, extend your legs behind you so that you are on your toes and your body is a straight line from the crown of your head to your heels. Hold the position for at least five breath cycles, breathing deeply. Then release to the floor.
If you can't breathe through a full plank, you can modify the pose so that you are supporting your body on your knees and elbows, rather than your toes and hands.

, You can target the spine more directly by creating a vinyasa with the plank and cobra poses. With a vinyasa, you move from one pose to another with a breath for each movement.Start in plank, and on an exhale lower yourself to the ground, bending your elbows with your arms pressing close to your sides.
On an inhale, raise your upper body, leaving your lower body on the ground. Raise up until your arms are fully extended, opening your chest and lengthening your torso. Keep your shoulder blades melting down your back in line with your spine.
As you exhale, push your hips back and roll onto your toes to return to the plank position. Inhale, then on an exhale lower again. Repeat for five breath cycles.

, Downward facing dog is a good whole-body warm-up, and the mild inversion can be relaxing for your nervous system. This pose also is a calming pose that stimulates blood flow.From all fours, lift your hips toward the ceiling as you inhale, straightening your legs and arms so that you are roughly in an upside-down ""V"" shape. Stay on your toes, but press down toward the floor with your heels.
Lift away from your wrist joints, keeping your shoulder blades in line with your spine and your gaze soft. Stay in the pose for at least five breath cycles. On each inhale, focus on lifting towards the ceiling. With every exhale, focus on pressing down through your heels.

, Child's pose is a standard resting pose in yoga, but also benefits your spinal flexibility by encouraging a long spine and bringing peaceful energy and relaxation to your lower back.From all fours, slowly lower your hips on an exhale until your buttocks are resting on your heels. You may want to put a rolled towel or blanket behind your knees if you have any joint pain.
Walk your hands slightly forward so that you can extend your arms all the way out in front of you, and on an inhale fold your torso over your thighs, keeping your spine long. Lower your forehead to rest on the floor.
If you can't comfortably rest your forehead on the floor, you may want to use a block or another flat object such as a book so you can keep your spine aligned in the position. Hold this pose as long as you want, breathing deeply.

Do a plank vinyasa.,
Move into a bridge with a lift.,
Add some windshield wipers.,
Try the rocking boat.",How to Flatten Your Abs with Yoga2," If you've done any ab work at all, you probably are familiar with planks. A vinyasa in yoga involves moving between different poses with a breath for each movement to stimulate blood flow and burn fat.Start on all fours on the floor with your wrists directly under your shoulders, palms spread wide. Straighten your legs behind you, balancing on the balls of your feet. You are now in plank position.
Your body should be a straight line of energy from your heels to the crown of your head. Make sure you can maintain deep breathing through this pose before you continue. If a full plank is too difficult for you, modify the position by coming to your knees and elbows.
On an exhale, bend your right knee and tuck your right leg towards your chest. As you inhale, move your right leg back to join the left. Exhale and tuck your left leg the same as you did your right. Inhale return to plank position.
Alternate 8 to 20 times, maintaining your breath. Once you finish, you may want to counter by lifting your hips into a downward dog, or you can lower your hips back to sit on your heels and rest in child's pose.

, The bridge pose builds strength in your core. Lifting in time with your breath adds an aerobic element that will encourage the burning of fat around your midsection as you build muscle.Lie on your back with your legs extended. Bring your knees up so that your feet are flat on the floor, about hip-width apart. As you exhale, lift your hips and press down into your feet. You can bring your hands together under your body, or keep them at your sides. Lift your chest toward your chin, keeping your shoulders rolled back and down so that your shoulder blades are in line with your spine.
Slowly lower your hips as you inhale. On exhale, lift your hips again. Repeat this lift 5 to 10 times, focusing on doing the work of lifting with your core.
After your repetitions, release and draw your knees into your chest to counter the stretch. You can slowly rock from side to side to massage your spine and lower back.

, Windshield wipers really work your obliques, the abdominal muscles running down the side of your body. Doing this twist with a breath for each movement gets your blood flowing to the abdominal region to help flatten your abs.Start by lying on your back with your legs lifted in your knees bent so that your shins are perpendicular to the floor. Extend your arms from your shoulders out flat on either side of your body, palms spread wide.
On an exhale, lower your legs to the right until they are 2 or 3 inches over the floor. Inhale and bring your legs back to center. On your next exhale, lower your legs to the left with the same motion.
Focus on moving with your core and keeping your shoulders and arms flat. Repeat the motion 10 times, or 5 times on each side. Once you're done, you may want to bring your knees to your chest and rock side to side or up and down to massage your spine.

, The boat pose by itself strengthens your abdominal muscles, but when you add movement with the rocking boat you set a fire in your belly that will work to help burn away that stubborn belly fat.Get into boat pose from a seated position. Bend your knees slightly, keeping your feet flat on the floor. Grab the backs of your thighs just below your knees and lean back at about a 45-degree angle.
On an exhale, raise your feet off the floor, pressing your feet, legs, and knees together. Your shins should be parallel to the floor.
Reach your arms forward at about shoulder height with your palms toward the floor.
To start the rocking, tilt your knees first to one side and then to the other. Try to follow your breath for at least 10 repetitions. It doesn't matter whether you start on an inhale or an exhale.
You can add a twist by reaching in the opposite direction your ""boat"" is rocking.

Stretch and contract your abs in cat/cow pose.,
Stimulate digestion with a seated spinal twist.,
Try the wind-relieving pose.,
Squeeze out toxins with a supine twist.",How to Flatten Your Abs with Yoga3," Cat/cow is a relaxing yoga movement that allows you to stretch and contract your entire abdominal region to reduce bloating and stimulate your digestive organs.Come onto all fours with your legs directly below your hips and your hands below your shoulders. Your arms and thighs should be perpendicular to the floor. On an inhale, lift your head and your tailbone, arching your back.
As you exhale, drop your head and tailbone towards the floor and curve your back outward, like the arching ""Halloween cat"" image.
Then inhale and arch upward, exhale drop downward. Do as many repetitions as feel good.

, The seated spinal twist squeezes your digestive tract, which can help relieve gas and bloating. This pose is especially good to do after you've just had a big meal.From a seated position, bend your right knee underneath you as you would in a cross-legged seat. Cross your left foot over so that it's flat on the floor outside your right thigh. You can keep your right leg straight if this is too difficult.
Lift with a straight back, wrapping your right arm around your left knee. Set your left hand on the floor behind your back and twist to the left. With every inhale, think of lengthening your back. With every exhale, try to deepen the twist.
Hold this pose for five to eight breaths, then return to center, switch legs, and do the other side.

, As the name suggests, the wind-relieving pose massages your intestines to help relieve gas and bloating. However, it does more than that, also strengthening your back and abdominal muscles to help flatten your abs.Start on your back with your legs extended, feet together, and your arms extended on either side. On an exhale, pull your right knee towards your chest. Wrap your hands around your knee or your shin and press towards your belly. Inhale.
On an exhale, lift your head and chest and try to touch your chin to your right knee. Be careful not to crunch your neck. Release back to the floor as you inhale.
You can repeat this three to five times before switching and doing the other leg. You can also do both legs at the same time.

, Twists increase circulation to your abdomen, encouraging better digestion and helping you more quickly eliminate toxins. This gentle twist can be done directly after the wind-relieving pose.If your knees are still bent in towards your chest from the wind-relieving pose, release one leg to the ground and extend it. If you are lying flat on your back with both legs extended, pull your right knee up towards your chest.
On an inhale, roll toward the left from your hips, keeping your right arm extended out straight from your shoulder. Try to keep your shoulder blade pinned to the floor, twisting only from your hips. You can place your left hand on the outside of your right knee to deepen the stretch, but don't force it.
Hold the twist for 10 breath cycles, breathing deeply in through your nose and out through your mouth. Then, on an exhale, slowly twist back to center. Release your right leg and repeat the twist on the other side.

Know that when you find it necessary to go around or if the tower instructs you to go around, immediately apply full power, move carb heat to cold and climb as you would just after takeoff.,
Push hard on the yoke to keep the nose from rising too quickly.,
Fly slightly off the runway center-line.,
Follow normal landing procedures.

",How to Execute a Go Around in a Cessna 172,";
, If your flaps are fully extended, you will have to exert a lot of force as you retract the first 10 degrees of flap immediately. Then in 10 degree increments retract the flap when you have a positive rate of climb. Do not retract your flaps all at once. You will sink and crash!

, An offset to the right is preferred so you are able to see the runway and any aircraft that may be a hazard. Remain your assigned pattern until you are cleared to land.

Try to engage the autopilot.",How to Prepare to Fly an Airplane in an Emergency," It is a standard aircraft panel with six round ""basic flight instruments,"" sometimes called ""the six pack."" These are the ones in the center, directly in front of the pilot's seat. Note, too, that some aircraft will also have a set of instruments and controls in the co-pilot position.;
, The six instruments will be located in the following order:


Top left - The ""Airspeed Indicator"" shows aircraft airspeed, usually in knots. (A knot is one nautical mile per hour—about 1.15 MPH or 1.85km/hr).
Top center - The ""Artificial Horizon"" shows the aircraft attitude, that is, how the plane is inclined in all directions—whether the plane is climbing or descending and how it is banking - left or right.
Top right - The ""Altimeter"" shows the height (altitude) of the aircraft, in feet MSL—feet above mean, or average, sea level.
Lower left - The ""Turn and Bank Indicator"" is a dual instrument which tells how fast you are changing the compass heading (rate of turn) and also whether you are in co-ordinated flight, feeling the proper (down-in-the-seat) Gs from the turn. This is also called the ""Turn and Slip Indicator"" or ""Needle Ball.""
Lower center is the ""Heading Indicator"" which shows the current compass heading. Keep in mind that small amounts of friction in the heading gyro dictate that this instrument be calibrated on an ongoing basis. This is explained below in the calibration procedure.
Lower right is the ""Vertical Speed Indicator"" which tells how fast you are going higher or lower. It gives the rate of descent (or climb) in feet per minute. Zero means that you are maintaining altitude and are neither climbing nor descending.

, Using the 172 panel photograph above, can you tell, by reading the six-pack panel instruments, what the aircraft's current situation is?


Your answer should have been, ""The aircraft is in a slightly climbing left turn, cruising at a speed of 110 knots about 3,100 feet (944.9 m) above sea level on a heading of 178° (almost due south).""

, The necessary controls for this mission will be as follows:



Throttle - A black knob - When pushed forward, the engine is at full throttle and when pulled full back, the engine is idling.

Fuel Mixture - A red knob - Pushed full inward is the richest mixture (used for sea level takeoffs and landings), while full back is engine off. Only pull the red knob full out when you are on the ground and ready to shut down the engine.

Carburetor Heat - Used to warm the engine air intake in icing conditions and on long descents with engine at idle - conditions where a cold engine with cold air could cause icing. Note that, for all practical purposes, this has to be either full-on or full-off.

Flaps - A flat handled switch to select the wing flap positions. This will be used for slowing the aircraft to a safe speed in preparation for landing the aircraft. Note that the flaps should be advanced notch-by-notch, one position (10°) at a time.

Fuel tank select - A Cessna 172 would almost always be set on ""Both Tanks.""

Steering wheel (Yoke) - This sets the attitude (climb and turn) and the speed of the aircraft. Use small pitch adjustments, in and out for pitch (to climb or descend). Turn the yoke left and right to bank the aircraft.

Engine RPM is used for setting engine speed (power) for climbing, descending, and/or landing.

Rudder Pedals - These are operated by your feet. Press the top edge of the pedals and the brakes are applied. (Of course, this only has an effect when you are on the ground.) Pressing the lower part of the pedals allows steering while on the runway and helps do quality turns in the air. You will also use the lower part of the rudder pedals to stay lined up with the runway while on final approach.

Control trim - There are two trim wheels in the panel which, when adjusted properly, give you almost hands-off control. You will not be using these in an emergency. Be aware too, if you do try to use them to trim for landing, you may not have enough pitch control to gain altitude quickly in case of a go-around. You would have to re-trim in case of a go-around, but it is way better to just stay away from these controls and consider them off limits.


, The radio or NAV/COM equipment is used to navigate the plane and, importantly, to talk to the tower or ATC (Air Traffic Control). In an emergency, call them as soon as you get the aircraft under control.

, Changing frequency may not be necessary, but you should know how to do this and should take the time to practice before you are in an emergency situation so that you will not get hung up on this when an emergency does arise. Communication is a critical aspect of surviving an emergency situation.—There is little chance that you will be able to land safely without the tower and their guidance., Commit the emergency frequency to memory, just in case you may need it., Work until this becomes second nature and you can switch and tune frequencies easily and naturally., If you are already talking to ATC, then stay on that frequency as long as you can. ATC will tell you when to change frequencies. Do not go to emergency frequency. Just tell ATC that you are ""Declaring an Emergency.""—They will help you get home safely. Do whatever they ask of you and be sure to get confirmation about anything you are not sure of before you take action.
, It is best if you reinforce what you learned about the six pack and the basic controls in an actual plane, preferably in a Cessna 172.

, Using a printout of the above steps, see if you can point to and touch every instrument and control listed. At the same time say aloud what each is used for., Not only should you immediately be able to name each instrument at a glance, but also describe the information you get from each instrument.

Look at the gauges and see if you can determine the normal operating ranges. Then ask yourself what basic actions you would have to perform to correct for certain conditions. For, example, if you were slightly descending and wanted to get back to level flight, what would you have to do? Take a few moments to deeply think about the scenarios you imagine and visualize the correct action you might take. This will prime your mind to absorb further lessons.
It is highly recommended that you spend enough time doing this to feel like you have it mastered, up to this point. You should, at a minimum, have a good feel for what information each instrument gives and how it relates to the plane position and near-term flight path.

, Normal airspeed will, of course, be in the green and the lower edge of green indicates the flap-up stall speed. Try your best to keep the instrument in the green arc while cruising.

Use the Yoke to adjust nose-up and nose-down (pitch) to set the airspeed; do not use the throttle to adjust airspeed.

The red line is the ""never exceed"" speed line. Stay out of there!
The white range is safe flap lowering speed and the lower end of white is the stall speed for full flaps down (only used when on final approach for landing).


The Artificial Horizon has a miniature aircraft in the center. In straight and level flight it should stay there. If it starts to drift, use the yoke to re-center and/or level the small airplane on the horizon line.
The Altimeter may start to wind or unwind. If you seek to maintain level flight, use the yoke to stabilize your altitude. You can see that you will have to scan these six instruments to maintain control of the aircraft. – That's why the six are right together in front of the pilot. Scan them often.
The Needle Ball should stay centered when you are in level flight and turning the aircraft. When turning, the needle ball graphically shows you the quality of the turn you're making. Strive to keep your turns very shallow, less than 10°. This will keep you out of trouble. which is what you are after whenever you fly a plane, particularly for the first time, and, particularly, in an emergency.
The Heading Indicator should be on the heading you are trying to fly. If not, use the yoke to make one (or a series of) very shallow turn(s) to stay on course. Don't chase the heading too much; just make very small corrections and patiently wait for the reading to settle. That will feed back on how you're doing and you can correct a bit again, if needed.
The Vertical Speed also should be centered at zero in level flight. If not, make small pitch corrections with the yoke, don't chase the rate of change of ascent or descent.—Make one small correction, same as above, and continue scanning the instruments.

, When you incorporate all of the six pack in your scan routine, the scanning will get a little harder to do. The ""small corrections"" procedure is the same for all changes you will perform to control the aircraft. Get this thoroughly in your noggin and ingrain it in your being., It is critical to calibrate this instrument on an ongoing basis, usually 3-5 times an hour. If the Heading Indicator is off only a couple of degrees, you will not arrive at the airport where you intend to land. Therefore, it is critical to take hands-on instruction in the calibration of this instrument. It is normally adjusted to agree with the magnetic compass before takeoff and re-adjusted periodically in flight to correct for gyro precession errors. Set the heading indicator only in stabilized straight and level flight.,, In this phase, you use the yoke to maintain level by keeping the small airplane level and centered on the ""Artificial Horizon"" line. During daylight hours, this can be done just by looking out the windshield at the real horizon. Alternatively, you can scan the six pack and use the feedback to maintain level. In either case always make sure to look outside and to scan the six-pack when possible. Do not rely on one or the other when both are available.


Ensure that the RPM gauge is indicating a cruise setting of between 2100 and 2700 RPM.
When you are in straight and level cruise (flight), you can adjust the RPM using the throttle.

, Climbing is normally done under full throttle, but if only a gradual climb is necessary, you can pull back on the yoke to raise the aircraft nose about five and no more than ten degrees above the horizon while advancing the throttle slightly. Remember to also continually scan the six pack at all times and make very sure that nothing else is changing. Scanning the six pack will let you know if you start into a turn (start to bank the aircraft) or the airspeed starts to drop. If an unwanted bank starts, gently turn the yoke the other direction and if the airspeed diminishes, level off for a bit and advance the throttle a little more next time you try to climb.

The Cessna 172 can stall (in a turn) at approximately 65 knots (no flaps) so keep your turns shallow and avoid any speed below 80 knots to allow yourself a margin of safety. Remember to boost the speed by lowering the nose slightly and/or adding a little throttle when necessary. Again, use gentle corrections and stay well out of the danger zones that are indicated on the instruments.

, There are two scenarios: one for landing at an airport that is near your current position and one for landing at one that is farther away.

A descent to land at a nearby airport is done by reducing the throttle to an engine speed of about 1800 to 1500 RPM while setting the air/fuel mixture at full richness (red knob fully inward). If the descent will cause you to be a long time at low engine power, then you may have to use carburetor heat to prevent icing. At reduced RPMs, the engine will not be producing as much heat and you may have to kick on the carburetor heat. Do so only if the weather indicates possible icing conditions. Here, the tower can give you guidance, so ask if you aren't sure.
If you're descending for a landing at an airport further away, reduce throttle to 2000 RPM to descend while maintaining a higher airspeed. However, don't get going too fast. Watch the airspeed indicator and avoid going very far into the yellow arc.

, This will be the most critical part of your maiden flight. Again, there are two main ways to approach landing at any airport: the standard traffic pattern (45° angle to the runway) and the straight-in, lined up with the runway emergency approach. We will assume that you have clearance for the emergency approach.—After all, that is what this is—an emergency., The landing phase is the hardest to do successfully. Ideally, several landings should be practiced in a simulator or in an actual aircraft, if at all possible. Practicing landings ahead of time is highly recommended.
, The straight-in approach is preferred in an emergency, so maintain a higher altitude until you have the airport runway in sight then you can start your descent, keeping the runway in sight. Be sure to ask for the airport with the longest runway and, preferably, for an airport where ATC uses radar., AGL (above ground level). Hopefully you will be in contact with tower by then and they can advise you (with the aid of their radar). If not, then you have to make the approach yourself.

, level (above the runway) and slow the aircraft. Set the throttle to 1500 RPM, with a vertical descent rate of 500 feet (152.4 m). per minute and an airspeed of 80 knots.

, Remember to move the flaps only one notch at a time. Plan on full flaps down by the time you are five miles out. If your altitude is at least 1,000 ft., set the throttle to ""idle"" at this point with the mixture at full richness (red knob in). Use carburetor heat only if weather indicates possible icing conditions.


Each time you lower the flaps a notch (10°), push forward on the yoke a little to counteract the tendency of the flaps to raise the nose.

, You can slowly reduce your speed to 65 or 70 knots now.

, The airspeed should be 65 knots, with full flaps and a descent rate of 500 feet (152.4 m). per minute.,, Use the yoke only for pitch control (nose-up and down) at this point unless there is a crosswind, then you may have to use the yoke to bank slightly into the wind. Use only the rudder pedals to continually line up with the runway and stay on course.

, Keep everything the same all the way to about three to four feet above the runway, then start slowly raising the nose as the aircraft settles to the runway (called the flare).

,, If you're coming in a bit hot (going a little too fast), you can also raise the flaps to get better braking. Remember that the lower part of the rudder pedals help you to steer while you are on the ground, while the upper parts do the braking.
Pilots say ""Any landing you can walk away from, is a good landing."" Nice job!, The go-around is a very dangerous maneuver even for experienced pilots, and is not recommended for a beginner. However, if, at any time in your approach or landing, you see (or anticipate) major problems where things are not lining up as planned, a go-around is required.

, Make sure the carburetor heat is off and the fuel mixture is full rich. Do all this simultaneously, while raising the flaps slowly, a notch at a time., This action helps reduce the yoke pressure. Hopefully you noticed the advice about considering the trim wheels off limits and heeded that advice, so this step will not be needed. It is only included here as a part of a complete checklist for the go-round maneuver.

, Once your airspeed reaches 80 knots, do not raise the nose any further and, if the airspeed drops below 80 knots, lower the nose a bit to prevent a stall.

, above ground level (AGL).

, Gently turn the aircraft in a wide circle until you are lined up on the runway, still at 1,000 feet (304.8 m). AGL.

,, The mechanics of the human inner ear allows you to detect a change in motion or a change in velocity in any direction. Realize that your body senses only changes and also be aware that your mind has been trusting what the inner ear says each day of your life for a long, long time.


This is a hard thing to break away from, but it is absolutely critical to be able to ignore what your body is telling you because it may be wrong. Instead, when you do not have supplementary visual input, rely solely on the instruments.
Switch to total reliance on the instruments once you lose your ability to see clearly.
Once you lose the ability to determine your plane's spatial orientation by using visible cues (either the horizon, a beacon, or a landmark), you must compel yourself to rely solely on the instruments and force yourself to discard what your body is telling you.

, The tendency of untrained pilots is to ""fly by the seat of the pants"" and to enter the ""Death Spiral,"" a series of actions which inevitably leads to a crash.

If you enter a banking turn and stay there (in co-ordinated flight) for twenty seconds or so, your body gets acclimated to the turn and thinks you are flying straight and level when you are still in a banking turn. In the dark or when visibility is limited, you have no visual cues to correct the impression your body has picked up.
The ""Death Spiral"" starts when you notice you are losing altitude (common in banking turns) and pull up on the yoke to gain altitude. The problem comes from being in a banking turn: Pulling back on the yoke results in tightening the turn and a further loss of altitude, not in gaining altitude. The natural tendency is then to pull back even more on the yoke and that makes things even worse. Moral of the story: Trust the ""Artificial Horizon.""


, Make sure you are in straight, level flight before you make an altitude correction. This will be apparent on the ""Artificial Horizon"" provided the ""Heading Indicator"" is relatively constant.


Be highly aware that any loss of altitude might be the result of entering a banking turn without realizing it. This will be evident on the ""Artificial Horizon"" and on your ""Heading Indicator.""If your heading is changing, you are turning.


,, Trust your instruments., In Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC), this is your best chance for a safe landing."

Practice breathing exercises before beginning.",How to Do a Reclining Hero Pose," The first thing you need to do to get into the Hero pose is to position yourself on the mat properly. Without being positioned on the mat properly, you won’t be able to set yourself up for the pose.


Position yourself on your mat with your knees, shins, and feet flat on the mat.
Your legs (from feet to knees) should be spaced hip width apart.
Your body should be tilted forward a little bit.
Inhale and exhale as you are situating yourself.;
, After you’re positioned on the mat with your legs hip width apart, you’ll need to slowly sit in between your heels. Do this movement slowly and deliberately, otherwise you might mess up the movement or injure yourself.


Your arms should be parallel with your body and your hands should be touching/grabbing your legs and calves.
Tuck your thumbs into your knee creases,
Your ankles should be in line with your knees.
Move your behind slowly down toward the ground between your feet., If because of pain or discomfort, you are unable to completely sit on the floor between your feet, use a pillow or a block to prop your behind up. Don’t be ashamed to use a pillow or a block. Your ability to sit fully on the ground will come slowly, as you do more stretches and practice the pose.

, Now that you’re sitting on the ground (or on a pillow), you need to make sure that your torso is straight in the air. Sitting straight up, perpendicular to your feet, will promote good posture and stretch your muscles.


The straightening of your torso will complete the Hero pose.
Inhale and exhale as you sit up.
Take several moments to stretch and enjoy the pose., Before you begin to transition from the Hero to the Reclining Hero pose, you should breathe deeply and inhale and exhale. Breathing deeply will help relax your mind and body.


Inhale and count to 5.
Slowly begin a long exhale while counting from 6 to 10.
Repeat this as many times as you like., Slowly place your palms on the mat behind your feet. This will begin the process of reclining from the Hero pose. The end of this transition will be a full recline.


Make sure to move your arms, hands, and palms slowly as you begin to place them on the mat behind you.
Make sure your movements are slow and deliberate.
Continue breathing exercises, if you want., Slowly begin the process of leaning back. At the same time, take your hands (and palms) that are already on the ground and walk them further back from your feet as you lean back.


This is a transitionary position that you will do quickly, but deliberately.
The process of leaning back will continue until you are almost parallel with the ground.
Move slowly so as to not hurt your back or pull any muscles., Continue the process of reclining/leaning backward. Make sure your elbows are now touching the ground and your forearm is flat on the ground in a line with your feet and legs.


Your hands should now be touching the last few inches of the bottom of your feet.
Your upper arm should be perpendicular with your forearm
Your torso should be angled slightly to your arms and the ground., Slowly begin the process of lowering your body flat to the ground. Lowering your body to the ground will complete the reclining hero position.


As you are lowering your body to the ground, slowly slide your forearms forward so your hands are gripping the heels of your feet.
Hold the pose and breathe deeply.
If you want, bring your arms over your head to stretch them., After you’ve held the pose for as long as you want, it will be time to release yourself from the pose. Releasing the pose will be a moment of relief, as your mind and body will be able to relax a bit.


Begin releasing from the pose by pressing up from your arms and elbows.
Slowly push yourself and then pull yourself up toward your legs.
Use all of your muscles, including your stomach muscles and leg muscles., The Reclining Hero Pose is a moderate to advanced pose that requires a certain level of fitness. Before you attempt it, you need to know if you are fit enough. Consider:


Talking to your doctor.
Discussing the pose and your fitness level with a personal trainer or a yoga instructor.
Making sure you work into the pose by starting with simpler and beginner poses.
Stopping immediately if you feel pain or a high level of discomfort.
Avoiding this pose if you have persistent back problems, are pregnant, or have other relevant health issues., Practicing the reclining hero pose is best done in a quiet and relaxing location. Making sure you are in a relaxed and quiet location will not only help you relax, but will help you concentrate on the complex movements you will need to perform in order to do the pose.

, After you’ve found a good location, make sure you have a flat surface to lay your yoga mat on. A flat surface is very important, since you’ll be reclining and laying down during the pose. If you cannot find a flat surface where you are, look for a different location.

, Many people who do yoga like to start off with breathing exercises before they start different movements and poses. This is highly recommended, as not only does it help relax your body, but it also helps clear your mind.


Breathe deeply.
Consider counting out your breaths. Inhale and then count to five. Start your exhale at six and complete it at the count of ten.
Make sure to experiment with breathing and to consult a yoga teacher if you have any questions.

, The six instruments are located on the instrument panel in the following order:


Top left - The Airspeed Indicator shows aircraft airspeed, usually in knots. (A knot is one nautical mile per hour—about 1.15 MPH or 1.85km/hr).
Top center - The Artificial Horizon shows the aircraft attitude and whether the plane is climbing or descending as well as whether it is in a bank to the left or to the right.
Top right - The Altimeter shows the height (altitude) of the aircraft in feet MSL—feet above mean, or average, sea level.
Lower left - The Turn and Bank Indicator is a dual instrument which tells what angle of bank you are in during a turn (rate of turn) and also whether you are in co-ordinated flight and feeling the proper, down-in-the-seat G-force from the turn. This is also called the ""Turn and Slip Indicator"" or ""Needle Ball.""
Lower center - The Heading Indicator shows the aircraft's current compass heading. This instrument needs to be calibrated on a regular schedule.
Lower right - The Vertical Speed Indicator tells how fast the aircraft is climbing or descending.

Note: The two round instruments directly to the right of the six pack are dual VOR (VHF Omni-directional Range) instruments, and to the right of them are two identical VOR radios, used for communications and VOR navigation.







, The necessary controls for flying this plane are:


Throttle – a black knob – When pushed forward, the engine speed increases and when pulled back, the engine speed decreases. Full back is idle speed.

Fuel mixture – a red knob – Pushed full inward is the richest mixture (used for sea level takeoffs and landings). Full back will shut the engine off. Only pull the red knob fully out when you are on the ground and ready to shut down the engine.

Carburetor heat – Used to warm the engine air intake in icing conditions, notably on long descents with the engine at low power or idling, conditions which result in a cold engine paired cold air which often cause icing. Note: For all practical purposes, this has to be either full-on or full-off.

Flaps – a flat handled switch – Used to select the wing flap positions. Flaps are usually deployed to slow the aircraft to a safe speed in preparation for landing. Note that the flaps should be advanced notch-by-notch; one position (10°) at a time.

Fuel tank select – A Cessna 172 will almost always be set on ""Both Tanks.""

Yoke (""steering wheel"") – This sets the attitude (climb and turn) and the speed of the aircraft. Use small pitch adjustments, in and out for pitch (to climb or descend). Turn the yoke left and right to bank the aircraft.

Rudder pedals – These are operated by your feet. Press the top edge of the pedals and the brakes are applied. Pressing the lower part of the pedals allows steering while on the runway.

Control trim – There are two trim wheels in the panel. One trims the aileron and the other trims the rudder, thereby reducing the control pressure required to operate the respective controls. Trimming allows you to more easily maintain your direction of flight. Take care not to over-trim when landing as you may then not have enough pitch control to gain altitude quickly in case of a go-around (aborted landing).

, Sit in the aircraft and spend time there just studying each instrument.

Quiz yourself on each of the instruments. You should be able find and name each instrument at a glance, even in a darkened cockpit environment and also describe the information you get from each instrument.
Look at the gauges and see if you can describe the instrument and know how you would use its readings to adjust your flight path.
It is highly recommended that you spend enough time in the aircraft to be comfortable with all of the instruments and feel like you have them mastered.

,, Before you begin, purchase the chart at your local airport, online, or at a pilot's store, then study the chart carefully. Find your local airport, taking particular note of your airport's required communication and navigation frequencies.

Find a radio manual and set up the radios at the required frequencies to communicate with:
The following order is an example for most cross country flights.
ATIS, Automatic Terminal Information System.
Airport Ground Control.
Airport Tower.
Airport Departure Control.
Flight Service Stations.
ATC, Air Traffic Control.
Airport Approach Control.
The Aviation Emergency Frequency.
Commit the emergency frequency to memory, but do not test it.
Listen to these frequencies. If you're not yet a pilot, don't talk on them. However, if you are a new student, you can tune in to the ground control frequency and ask Ground Control for a radio check.
Alternatively, your flight instructor will provide you with this information. Make sure to ask questions about anything you are unsure of.
Practice changing between frequencies. You should practice switching among the frequencies you need to use at your airport until this becomes second nature and you can switch and tune frequencies easily and naturally.

,


VOR. A dual navigation system that will guide you from your departure to your destination accurately and reliably. VOR navigation is most important in IFR approaches, but is no longer the only option when visibility is poor, GPS has been taking the place of VOR. in some aspects like VFR flights and even ILS type approaches.
Look at your sectional chart for your local airport and/or nearby VOR stations. If you have the VOR manual you should be able to listen to the VORs and even test your VOR instruments for accuracy by viewing them on the aircraft panel.
Alternatively, your instructor will show you how to set up the VOR instruments and provide you with the required VOR frequencies.
Practice setting up your local airport VOR frequency while you're on the ground. Some day it might be handy when you have to return to your airport after takeoff because you suddenly encounter poor visibility.
Most airports have a VOR Test spot on the field called compass rose, (Refer to airport diagram below). Taxi over to the ""Compass Rose"" test area and turn on the VORs in your aircraft. Your VORs should each be within 4 degrees of the required heading.
Depending on where you intend to fly, however, you will need to master the GPS.

,
Now that GPS systems have (WAAS) Wide Area Augmentation System , making GPS as accurate as VOR ILS systems.
Most aircraft now have GPS and some experienced pilots even a carry on handheld GPS. These hand helds not legal for guiding the aircraft, but it still comes in handy from time to time.
Turn on the GPS and you'll see a display similar to your car GPS. However, the aircraft version is such that you'll probably have to spend many hours to become really good at programming and interpreting the GPS display (and this should be your goal).

,





.

The ADF system is a great backup system that will show you where you are using a system that seeks out any local ADF ground station or any public AM radio signal and points to the signal source.
If you turn and fly the direction the needle points it will take you directly to the ground station. You will know when you fly over the station. The needle will switch 180 degrees and point directly behind the aircraft.
This system makes an accurate and simple navigation aide.

, The Transponder is a panel mounted instrument for sending your aircraft position, and altitude to ATC so they can track your aircraft for safety to you and to other aircraft.


ATC may ask you to turn on your transponder and set it to ""send"" (Squawk 1200) (pronounced Squawk one two zero zero). 1200 is the code for just a general VFR flight cruising around, or in a practice area.
For instance, If you should have a radio failure in flight, squawk 7600 (pronounced seven six zero zero) so ATC will know your problem.
ATC will give you a code to enter into your transponder based on the type of flight you'll be making.
Study the manual on this transponder and learn all the other modes of operation there are.

,


Accurately measures, and displays, in nautical miles, the straight-line distance to your destination.
This is most useful in landing approaches.

, Marker Beacons are a three light radio beacon system.


This gives you a flashing light, on your panel, with a beeping sound (when your aircraft is exactly over each of the markers) showing your exact positions in the final approach to an airport.
The three markers are called, Outer Marker, Middle Marker, and Inner Marker, placed in three spaced positions down the centerline of the ILS (Instrument Landing System).
This system is designed to not waste any time of the pilot having to look for the instrument.

,


ADS-B, or (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast), is a cornerstone of Next Generation air traffic modernization.
Mandated soon by the FAA for all aircraft operating in airspace that now requires a Mode C transponder must be equipped with ADS-B.
This new system, when properly installed and operated, will allow the pilot to see, and be seen, and avoid all other aircraft in the vicinity.
In addition to aircraft traffic, in flight services and weather information can also be supplied to the pilot.

, Before taking off, it is important to perform a walk-around examination. This is a visual inspection of the aircraft to verify that the airplane components are in good working order. Your instructor should provide you with a more detailed and highly useful operating checklist, not just for the walkaround but for all the specific airplane procedures that cover the other phases of flight.

, Follow the pre-flight check list in the aircraft manual or one obtained from your instructor. The most important required items will be listed in the pre-flight checklist. Some are:

Check control surfaces. Remove any control locks and make sure your ailerons, flaps, and rudder are moving freely and smoothly.
Visually check your fuel tanks and oil. Make sure they're filled to the specified levels. To check the fuel level, you'll need a clean fuel measuring rod. To check oil, there's a dipstick in the engine compartment.
Check for fuel contaminants. This is done by draining a small amount of fuel into a special glass container and looking for water or dirt in the fuel. Your instructor should show you how. If not, ask.

Look for nicks, dings, and any other type of body damage. These small imperfections might inhibit your aircraft's flying ability, especially if the prop is compromised. Always check props before an engine start. And, make sure to use caution around airplane props. – If there are electrical issues with the plane, the prop could turn over unexpectedly, causing severe injury.

, Calculating a weight and balance helps ensure that you are not flying outside the capabilities of your airplane.

If you need to complete the weight and balance sheet because you have additional weight in the aircraft, your instructor will show you how.
If it's just you and your instructor in the aircraft and you verify that there is no extra weight in the aircraft, you normally won't have to complete a weight and balance sheet.

, Your instructor will show you how to get the aircraft prepared.


There is a lengthy procedure to get the aircraft cockpit area set up and ready for starting the engine.
Take your time work through this procedure and be sure not to miss anything.
The following procedures are just an approximation of what your instructor will ask you to perform. This will show you what to expect, but follow the directions of your instructor.

, Once the aircraft is set up and running, turn on your strobe lights.


You can now get clearance to taxi out.
Any time you're in motion, turn on your taxi lights also.

,

Specify the runway and direction. For example, request a South departure on runway 20R (pronounced two zero Right) or whatever direction and runway you prefer for departure.
Listen to the clearance and write it down. All pilots are required to read back all clearances to Ground, or any instructions given, in all phases of flight.
Follow the route given to you exactly as stated. Do not cross any runways until you're specifically told to do so by ground control. Always stop and ask if you're not sure.
If your stopping for an engine run-up, let ground control know.
Perform the engine run-up as described in your aircraft manual (or by your instructor).
Contact Ground and request clearance to continue taxiing to the assigned runway.
Continue taxi to the runway Hold Position sign and stop there (do not let your aircraft be on or over any part of the Hold Position markings.

,






If Tower says ""Line up and Wait."", which means line up behind any aircraft ahead of you. If no aircraft are in front of you, then you may enter the runway, but hold there for the final ""cleared for takeoff"" order from Tower, then read that back.
The command to Line up and Wait (and the Hold Position sign) are the most critical instructions in aviation, and need to be completely understood by all pilots. If in doubt, Stop and ask.

, then apply power and go after checking for any other aircraft on final approach or an aircraft or vehicle on the runway.,

Push the fuel mixture knob fully inward and advance the throttle to full throttle. As the aircraft gains speed, it will pull to the left and you will have to add a little right rudder to stay on the runway center line.
Pull gently back on the yoke when your speed reaches 55 knots. This will cause the aircraft to slowly lift off the runway.
When the aircraft reaches 70 to 80 knots, maintain that speed throughout the climb. Keep the wings level and showing only a few degrees of climb. At the same time, continue holding back on the yoke as needed to maintain 70 to 80 knots (the required climb speed for a Cessna 172).
Make the exit turn. At about 500 ft. (150m) of altitude, make your required exit turn. Most airports have a requirement of making a 45° turn to exit the airport area (or you may request a straight-out departure).
Stay in coordinated flight by using the needle ball (turn coordinator). This gauge has a little airplane with a level line and a black ball that rolls back and forth along the line. Keep the black ball in the center by adjusting the rudder so your turns feel smooth (coordinated). Pilots say step on the ball to know which rudder pedal to step on to center the ball and maintain a coordinated turn.
Note that the ailerons control the bank angle and work in conjunction with the rudder. When turning, coordinate the rudder and ailerons by keeping the turn and bank ball centered.

, At this point, Departure Control may ask you to turn on your transponder and set it to ""send"" (Squawk 1200) (pronounced Squawk one two zero zero). The Transponder is a panel mounted instrument for sending your aircraft position, and altitude to ATC so they can track your aircraft for safety to you and to other aircraft.

Maintain your speed. Every airplane has an engine power setting optimized for the cruise phase of flight. Once you've reached your desired altitude, cruise power should be set between 2100 RPM and 2900 RPM.
The FAA requires that all pilots must maintain an altitude at least 500ft above the highest object within 2000 feet horizontal. In other words keep at about 1000ft AGL at all times.
At this point some pilots setup the Automatic Pilot and relax, but most would prefer to fly the aircraft. In any case, the Auto Pilot is a very valuable instrument and will come in handy many times. May even save lives, so take time to study and learn how it works for future needs.
If you choose to not use the auto pilot, use vertical trim to maintain your desired altitude to fly.
You will seldom need to use aileron (turn) trim in this aircraft. But verify that the aileron trim is set to zero.

,






An essential part of flying is staying in touch with ATC (Air Traffic Control), Approach Control and Tower (in that order), during approach and landing procedures.
You can find the correct frequencies on your sectional chart. Or on an Approach Chart as shown above.
ATC may inform you of air traffic in your area. FAA's AIM (Airman Information Manual) requires that you respond by saying ""Traffic in Sight"" if you see the traffic, or ""No Contact"" if you don't. Be sure to respond promptly.
The tower will tell you something like: Report entering downwind for runway 25L (pronounced two five Left), so set up your aircraft so you will approach runway 25L at the expected 45 degree angle, so that you will enter the airport area about 500 ft. (150m) above the runway. If given clearance to land runway 30 (pronounced three zero ), that will always be a straight-in approach. (See airport Chart above.)
The runway numbers refer to the compass heading of the runway. The letters R & L refer to the left and right runways, when there are parallel runways (as shown above).
There is a procedure called LAHSO (Land and Hold short). This requires you, at some airport runways, to land but hold short at the LAHSO sign at the runway crossing point ahead. If you feel you can't handle this procedure, tell tower and get another runway.The above airport has such a procedure.
Refer also to Aviation Phonetics Chart Below. Memorize this chart, you will need to know them at all times that you are PIC (Pilot in Command).

, To do this, reduce power by backing off on the throttle, but do not deploy the flaps yet. Only lower the flaps when you reach your entry point. Again, do not lower the flaps when airspeed is excessive; do so only when the airspeed is within the white arc on the airspeed instrument.

Stabilize the airspeed and rate of descent with a combination of yoke, power and flaps down. Maintain your speed at 80 knots with a descent rate of 500 ft./min. (150m/min) until you reach about 1000 ft. AGL. You may reduce the throttle to idle now if you prefer, or later in the landing.as long as you maintain your speed at 60 to 70 knots and hold that speed until you reach about 10 ft. (3m) above the runway. (You’ll learn this with practice.)
Verify throttle at idle and raise the nose slowly by pulling back on the yoke. Try to hold the aircraft at a couple feet off the runway until the two main wheels touch down. Continue holding the nose wheel off the ground; it will settle to the ground, safer, by itself.
Apply some judicious braking once the nose wheel has touched down. This will slow the aircraft for safely exiting the runway.

Never stop on a runway, unless told to by Tower or Ground Control.
Exit as quickly as possible using the off ramp specified by the tower. You'll see Runway Boundary markings on the taxiway in front of you. Taxi quickly over this line to a point where the tail of your aircraft has also crossed the lines. At this point, stop and call Ground Control for permission to taxi to the parking area. Read back the instructions (as always) and follow the instructions back to the parking spot.





.

,


Runway approaches at night show you a lot of helpful indicators about the runway approach area, for safety reasons.
The row of lights across the runway end are called RAIL (Runway End Identifier Lights).
Note also that the runway markings and side lights are white, taxiway lights, however are always blue.

, Practice these phonetics, you will need them constantly and at a moments notice.


ATC and all other aviation Flight Service Stations will always use these phonetics.
Don't make up your own.

, Runway signs are very important, all pilots need to learn what they mean.


The runway signs shown above indicate that you're on taxiway Alpha, heading toward runway 21 (pronounced, Runway two one). There is an ILS (Instrument Landing System) Hold sign there, and beyond that is a Runway Hold sign.
You need to stop at both hold signs (unless already cleared) to get permission to continue to Runway 21. (Remember, you must get ""Line-up-and wait"" command) before entering any runway.

If in doubt, Stop and ask , Whomever you're in radio contact with.

Lightly touch the bases of your palms, then the palms themselves, and finally your fingers to make prayer hands. You can leave a small space between your palms if you like to let energy flow.
If you don’t know what your intention is, consider something as simple as “letting go.”

, Start by standing in tadasana, or mountain pose, at the front of a yoga mat. This will allow you to most easily flow into Surya Namaskar B.Tadasana, or mountain pose, is when you stand at the front of a yoga mat with your feet hip width apart and your arms at your sides. Gaze forward, spread your toes, and make sure your balance is evenly distributed between both feet.Make sure to engage your abdominals and lightly pull your sacrum toward the ground, which is sometimes referred to as engaging your root lock or mula bandha.Inhale and exhale evenly through your nose. If you can, make a slight sound like the sea when you breathe. This is called ujayyi breathing and can help you flow through your downward dog more effectively., Inhale and raise your hands towards the ceiling in an upward salute, which is also called urdhva hastasana.Gently arch your back as you look up towards your hands.


For a variation on this position, you can hook your thumbs in front of your body and raise your attached arms so that they end up by your ears. Hooking your thumbs may also help you enter a light backbend while pulling your sacrum towards the floor.
Make sure to completely extend your elbows and reach up through your fingers towards the ceiling. Only tip your head back slightly, making sure not to compress your cervical spine.Do this without hunching your shoulders and make sure to keep your chest and heart area open.You can take a slight backbend in urdhva hastasana, which is easiest to do by simply pulling down your sacrum, or tailbone., Exhale and “plunge” into standing forward bend, which is also called uttanasana.It’s important to keep your back straight and hinge forward at your waist as you transition from upward salute (urdhva hastasana) to standing forward bend (uttanasana). It may help you to remember to keep your heart open.Plant your palms flat on the floor next to either foot. Your fingers should point forward and be fully spread apart so that your entire palm is pressing into the floor, which will make it easier to flow into the following asanas.
It’s important to keep your abs engaged and in contact with your thighs.If necessary, bend your knees to keep this contact.
If your palms don’t reach the floor, put them on blocks so that your entire hand is pressing into the floor.If you used the alternative pose with hooked thumbs, bring your attached arms over your head before placing your hands on the floor in uttanasana.

, Gently inhale and extend your spine into a standing half forward bend, which is also called ardha uttanasana. This position will make it easier for you to enter the following asanas.


Make sure to keep your spine straight as you extend halfway upward. You’ll also want to keep your palms firmly planted on the floor next to your feet.Make sure to keep your abs engaged while you’re in this position., Keeping your palms firmly on the floor, exhale and extend your right leg into a lunge position. This is a transition pose, or asana, and will help you more effectively and smoothly flow through the remaining asanas in Surya Namaskar B.It’s important to make sure that your palms are firmly planted on the ground in this pose so that you can easily get into the next asana.
Push through your right heel for stability., In the same exhale as your right-legged lunge, pick up your left leg towards your chest and extend it back. Hinging at your hips, end up with both legs in downward facing dog.Push your sitting bones towards the ceiling. You should end up in an inverted “V” position, which is downward facing dog, or adho mukha savasana in Sanskrit.This position should feel calming and allow you to rest as you get deeper into the vinyasa, or series.
Keep your palms pressing flat against the floor and your abs engaged.Roll your shoulders down your back and arms inward so the eyes of your elbows are facing one another.You can keep your gaze towards your navel, but make sure you’re head is hanging comfortably., From downward dog, inhale and hinge forward at your hips into plank pose, which is called kumbhakasana.Your shoulders should be over your hands and your heels pushing back in plank pose, which resembles a high push up position.Make sure to keep your abs engaged and spine long. Don’t pop your bum up.You shouldn’t need to adjust your body position when you hinge from adho mukhasavasana to plank pose. Your body is perfectly aligned to have you end up in the right position.
Your feet should be hip width apart and flexed., Take a breathe out and lower yourself into knees, chest and chin pose, or ashtanga namaskar. You’ll first lower your knees, then your chest, and then your chin to the ground.It’s easiest to get into this position by keeping the energy moving forward. To do this, slightly push off of your toes and place your chest between your hands with your hips raised.This may also ensure that you’re getting a good backbend out of this asana.
Keep your elbows tucked close to your sides, which may make it easier to slide your chest and chin forward.

, Take a breath in and push your chest forward through your hands into cobra pose, or jangasana. Pull your shoulders back and lift your chest and gaze slightly.Use the flex of your feet to push your chest forward into cobra. Your ribs should still be on the floor and your hands and elbows close to your sides.Once you’re in cobra, place the tops of your feet on the floor.This is a light backbend and drawing your shoulders down may help you more comfortably enter the asana.

, Breathe out and roll back over your toes so that your body ends up in an inverted “V” shape, which is downward facing dog or adho mukha savasana in Sanskrit. This position should feel calming and allow you to rest as you get deeper into the asana, or pose.Keep your palms pressing flat against the floor and your abs engaged.Roll your shoulders down your back and arms inward so the eyes of your elbows are facing one another.Your toes may not be flexible enough to allow you to roll over them. If this is the case, modify the pose by picking up your feet and placing the backs on the floor.
Your heels may or may not touch the floor, depending on how flexible your lower back, hamstrings, and calf muscles are. The more you practice, the easier it will be to get your heels to the floor.Keep lifting your sitting bones towards the ceiling.You can keep your gaze towards your navel, but make sure you’re head is hanging comfortably.Inhale and exhale steadily for 5 breaths and then prepare to end the sun salutation., You’re almost done with this round of sun salutations. Taking a breath in, lunge your right foot forward followed immediately by your left.

, In order to finish the sun salutation, you need to end up in tadasana.Hinging forward completely, exhale and fold completely forward into standing forward bend, or uttanasana. You’re almost done with your first round of surya namaskar C!

, You’re ready to come full circle like the sun. Inhale and rise up radiantly by bringing your prayer hands towards the ceiling in urdhva hastasana.Gently arch your back as you look up towards your hands.


Remember to keep your spine straight as you rise into urdhva hastasana.If you did the arm variation at the beginning with hooked fingers, make sure to do that as you end, too.

, Bring your prayer hands back to your sides as you exhale and return to tadasana. Take a minute or two to enjoy the heart-opening effects and energizing effects of surya namaskar.You can do as many more sun salutations as you like to help yourself warm up.

Familiarize yourself with the helicopter components and controls.,
Understand the helicopter's capabilities and limitations.,
Operate the collective control with your left hand.,
Operate the cyclic control with your right hand.,
Operate the tail rotor pedals with your feet.,
Take off.,
Hover by finding a balance between the collective, cyclic and tail rotor controls.,
Climb and descend using speeds according to your pilot operating handbook.,
Land, taking care to always have your landing target in sight, normally slightly to your right (pilots side).",How to Fly a Helicopter," Read your individual aircraft’s operating handbook. Here are some of the basic controls you’ll need to know to operate the helicopter:


The collective is the lever mounted on the cabin floor to left side of the pilot’s seat.
The throttle is the twistable grip at the end of the collective.
The cyclic is the “stick” located directly in front of the pilot’s seat.
The tail rotor is controlled by the two pedals on the floor also known as anti-torque pedals.;
, The majority of accidents are caused when the rotor system gets overloaded. When pilots attempt maneuvers that require more lift than the rotor system can produce or more power than the helicopter’s power-plant can provide to maintain lift.,


Raise the collective to make the helicopter rise, and lower it to make it go down. The collective changes the main rotor's blade angle collectively. The main rotor is on top of the helicopter.
Adjust the throttle. As you raise the collective, you need to increase engine speed. Decrease speed as you lower the collective. Throttle is directly linked to the position of the collective lever so that the RPM is always in line with the collective setting. You will only need to make adjustments when necessary.

, The cyclic is similar to a joystick, but sensitive, so make very small movements.


Push the cyclic forward to move forward, back to move backward, and to either side to travel sideways. The cyclic does not change the direction in which the front of the helicopter points, but it does cause the helicopter to tilt forward and back (pitch) or to the right and left (roll).

, These two pedals (or anti-torque pedals) control the direction in which the helicopter is pointing, more or less having the same effect as the yaw pedals in an airplane.


Gently increase pressure on the left pedal to swing the nose left, or increase pressure right to swing the nose right.
The yaw pedals increase or decrease the force that the tail rotor produces, thereby controlling the yaw. Without a tail rotor to counteract main rotor torque, the helicopter will naturally spin in the opposite direction of the main rotor.

, Follow these steps to perform a standard takeoff:


First, open the throttle slowly until you reach proper operating RPM.
Pull the collective gradually up. As collective pitch increases, push the left pedal (right pedal for clockwise rotating main rotors). Continue pulling on the collective and depressing the left pedal. Adjust the pedal if the aircraft is turning to the left or right.
The helicopter will leave the ground and you'll be able to use the cyclic. As you continue to pull the collective and depress the pedal, adjust the cyclic to level the aircraft as you take off. Push forward slightly to start moving forward.
As the helicopter transitions from vertical to forward motion, it will shudder and the nose will pull up. Push the cyclic forward a little more to make sure you keep going forward. The phenomenon that causes the shudder is called effective translational lift (ETL).
As speed increases the Rotor blades lift becomes more effective. It is important to anticipate for this phenomenon and correct for them.
As you progress through ETL, reduce the collective lever and apply less pressure to the pedal. Push the cyclic forward to avoid an abrupt nose high attitude and reduction in forward speed.
Once you’ve taken off, slightly release forward cyclic pressure. The aircraft will then begin to climb and gain airspeed. From this point, the pedals are primarily used to trim the aircraft. Most maneuvers will only require a combination of the cyclic and collective controls.

,


Learn to do this with an instructor, who can operate the other controls while you practice them 1 at a time, and then in combination. You must learn to anticipate the time lag between when you adjust the controls and the helicopter's reaction.

, This will vary depending on terrain. Maintain 15-20 knots during a steep climb. Carefully increase collective and be sure not to exceed the yellow limit of the torque gauge.

, This may mean that you have adjust your trim so you are turned slightly to one side as you approach.


Try to be around 200–500 feet (61.0–152.4 m) above ground or any obstacles when you are .5 kilometers from your landing area.
Watch your airspeed. At around .2km from the landing area slow the aircraft to 40 knots and begin to descend. Check your descent rate. Be careful not to let your vertical speed go over 300 feet (91.4 m) per minute. Vertical speed can be adjusting by applying the necessary amount of collective.
As you approach the edge of the landing area, gradually slow to 30, then 20 knots. You may need to bring the nose up to decrease airspeed. Doing so will momentarily obscure your sight of the landing area.
Keep moving forward when you get to the landing area, since it's much harder to control drift and land on the target if you hover first. Once the spot you want to land appears to slide beneath the nose of the aircraft you can then reduce the collective.
Arm the parking brake. Ease the cyclic back to reduce momentum and then forward to level the altitude. Keep rate of descent as low as possible — adjust the collective appropriately.
Once you have made contact with the ground, check that your parking brake is armed and then reduce all power.

Ask to see the pilot's certificate or license.,
Ask to see the pilot's FAA medical certificate.,
Ask the pilot about the hours they have flown.,
Ask where the pilot attended flight school.",How to Check a Helicopter Pilot's Credentials," The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has different requirements for each level of certificate. Pilots typically progress from student certificate to private pilot, commercial, and flight instructor.


A pilot with a Student Pilot's Certificate is someone taking flying lessons. That person must be 16 years old, able to speak English, and has a third class medical certificate. AN FAA medical certificate is needed before the student pilot can solo. However, this student certificate does not allow the pilot to perform the services noted above.
A pilot with a Private Pilot Helicopter License is able to fly a helicopter anytime and go anywhere and fly with anyone. This pilot cannot be paid for flying the helicopter. However, this means that if you are fortunate enough to know persons with this license then you may be able to go on a sightseeing trip with them. The FAA requires that a pilot have at least 40 hours of flight time and 20 hours of flight training. Your pilot will have successfully completed a written, oral and flight test.
A pilot with a Commercial Rotorcraft License will have at least 150 hours of flight time and 100 pilot in command time hours flying solo. This certificate lets the pilot fly for compensation or hire. However the individual positions listed above may require additional training specific to that occupation.
A pilot with a Flight Instructor License (CFI, CFII) is required to have at least 200 hours of flight time.;
, In addition to the medical certificate needed for a student pilot, a commercial pilot is required to have a second class medical certificate while airline transport pilots need a first class medical certificate.

, In addition to meeting the necessary hours for the various licenses, most pilots will have between 500 and 1,000 hours of piloting for many introductory jobs.

, You can then contact the FAA to inquire about the level of service provided by that school.

, Expect to pay around $500 for a three passenger helicopter and $1800 for a 5 passenger helicopter, depending on the distance you have to go. Sometimes it will be much more effective to make two trips in the smaller helicopter, depending on the distance.

, Make sure there are no wires because these are the biggest problem for a helicopter trying to land. Alert your chosen company as to where any wires are situated and realize that the company will make the final decision on where to pick up and land. Large fields or parking lots are best. Parking decks are great too, even better are those with lights.

, This is a requirement for the FAA (and most likely many other air traffic authorities in your part of the world).

, They can fly around thunderstorms, but not at night, for example.

, When entering the helicopter, the pilot will assist you. Do not slam the doors shut. They work with a simple close and a pin, very unlike a car door.

, Scarves, gloves, sunglasses, camera cases and cellular phones are dangerous when introduced to a tail rotor. Make sure they are under control before you approach the helicopter. In the summertime, just keep them pocketed.

, This is for your comfort, as there is seldom air conditioning; ask ahead of time, and expect to pay a slight premium for air conditioning if you desire it.

, This will not be a problem; just keep your arms inside, because the wind is four times the speed than that of your car. You can easily dislocate or injure your arm. Wind will not be an issue, wind is designed to slip around the aircraft, not into the cockpit.

Apply for work.",How to Become a Helicopter Pilot," You need to be at least 16 years old to obtain a private helicopter license. You need a private helicopter license before you can get a commercial helicopter license. Once you have your private helicopter license, you'll need to be at least 17 to obtain your commercial helicopter license.;
, All pilots have to pass a medical exam provided by an FAA approved physician. You can be disqualified if you have any health problems that might imply the risk of lapses in consciousness. These could include heart problems, psychological disorders, or a history of drug abuse. Your hearing and vision will also be checked, as well as your ability to perceive color.


Students with poor color vision may be prevented from becoming pilots. Pilots need to distinguish colors in order to understand light-signals when operating a helicopter. If you think you may have poor color vision, ask your optometrist to administer a test before you begin pursuing a career as a pilot.
If you are worried about being disqualified for any of these conditions, talk to an FAA approved medical examiner about your concerns.
Find an FAA approved medical examiner on the FAA website.

, You do not need to graduate from college to fly a helicopter, but having a degree can make it a lot easier to find a job. Most employers require you to have at least an associate's degree, and prefer a bachelor's. If you know you want to fly helicopters for a living, consider going to college for math, physics, or aeronautical engineering.


Helicopter pilots need to know algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus. There will be math questions on the test, and you will need especially good math skills to fly commercially.
You can take math classes at your flight school or aeronautical college. You can also study with books and study guides: look for guides written specifically for pilots.

, Getting civilian training is expensive. Flight schools will require you to provide some proof of funds before you are admitted. You can expect to pay $10,000-$15,000 for the training it will take to pass the helicopter pilot certification exams, plus $18,000-20,000 for commercial certification. Flight time with an instructor costs approximately $200 an hour. For time flying solo, you might pay around $160.The tests themselves must be taken through an FAA approved testing company. The written exams will run you between $200 to $300. The flight exams cost roughly $500.


If you choose to take out a loan, you might want to look into a Career Training Loan.
If you are already a pilot with a fixed wing license, you can apply for a rotorcraft add-on license, and you will not be required to fly as many hours to qualify for it.
There are few scholarships available for students of rotorcraft. There is a non-profit called Whirly-Girls that provides women who have already gotten their private pilot certification with scholarships to help them achieve a commercial private pilot certification., You can find flight schools listed at the FAA website. Before you choose, ask yourself where you want to be employed as a helicopter pilot in the future. If you want to fly in a mountainous area, you will get more practice if you go to a flight school in a mountainous area. Opt for schools that can boast of a high graduation rate and good job placement for graduates.


To be admitted, you will need to have passed your medical examination. You will also need proof of funds and a high school degree or equivalent.
Prospective rotorcraft students whose first language is not English must pass the TOEFL exam.
Consider attending a college or a university that offers an aviation program. That way, you can get your associate's or bachelor's degree at the same time that you obtain your helicopter licenses.

, In flight school, you will learn all the controls and maneuvers used to fly and land a helicopter. You will use simulators at first, then fly helicopters with an instructor. Before qualifying for your private license, you will do at least three hours of dual cross-country flying, three hours of dual nighttime flying, and three hours of solo cross-country flying. You will perform one 75-nautical mile cross-country flight, and perform three solo takeoffs and landings.


Dual flight time happens when you are flying the helicopter accompanied by your instructor. Solo flight time is when you are the sole occupant of the helicopter, though you may receive radio communications from your instructor on the ground. You will not begin flying solo until your flight instructor thinks you are ready.Your first solo flight is a milestone of your training. Pilots call it ""soloing.""

, Once you have amassed 40 hours of flight experience, including at least 10 hours as PIC, you can take your private license exam. You must score at least 70 percent to pass your written exam. This exam has 30-50 questions. Your flight exam will require you to answer questions and perform maneuvers you have learned in your flight lessons. If you fail a portion of it, you may be allowed to retake that part of the test.


Your exams will mostly be comprised of questions about rotorcraft and flying. You will be asked to identify functions of different parts of aircraft, quizzed on which moves to make during different crises, and asked to figure out simple points of procedure.
Study by taking the practice exams available at the FAA site.

, Once you have passed your private license exam, you must fly 150 solo hours before you qualify for your commercial helicopter license. If you are only interested in flying as a hobby, you do not have to get this license. If you are looking to work as a pilot, you will need to take the commercial license exam. This exam is similar to your private license exam, but includes an oral component and a check-ride.


During your exam your examiner will ask you to plan a flight. They will ask you follow up questions about conditions and procedure.
After or during this part of the exam, you will pilot a short flight with your examiner beside you. If you make an error, your examiner can choose to fail you, forcing you to take the entire test again, or pass you on the condition that you retake the section you failed. Once you have successfully demonstrated flying ability, flight knowledge, and good judgement, you will pass.

, To get an introductory pilot job, you will likely be required to have between 500 to 1000 hours of experience piloting a helicopter. You will not have amassed that many hours in the process of obtaining your commercial rotorcraft license: that will only have taken you 150 hours. To become a flight instructor, however, you are only required to have 200 hours. You can earn the hours you need to land a pilot job, and get paid to do so, by flying as an instructor., Because most jobs require more hours of flight experience than you will accrue in flight school, you might have to pay for more hours. If you do not becoming a commercial flight instructor, you can expect to pay about 160 dollars an hour for solo flight time with a private instructor.

, Your helicopter pilot's resume will list your hours of flight as well as your education and work experience. Include the aircraft you are familiar with, and any awards you have achieved from your flight school or the FAA. Ask your flight school for help making a professional looking resume, or look for templates online.

, Some industries you might enter include offshore support, fire fighting, law enforcement, agriculture, pipeline and utility support, sightseeing, executive transport, fishing, logging, EMS (Emergency Medical Services), and search and rescue. Check the requirements for each job posting to make sure you know how many hours you'll need to have flown, and if there are any other qualifications you might need.As soon as you graduate, ask your school if they are hiring, and to put you on a list of possible hires.

Becoming a helicopter mechanic is the same process as becoming a fixed wing aircraft mechanic.,
To get the A&P license, one must either attend an aviation mechanic school or have 30 months of hands on experience working on aircraft.,
Once the 30 months experience requirement is met or one has attended an aviation mechanic school, it is then possible to test for the A&P license.,
After acquiring the A&P license, one can now apply for helicopter mechanic positions.

",How to Become a Helicopter Mechanic," In the United States, this means getting the airframe and power plant certificates, or the A&P license as it is commonly called.;
, This means working on the various systems of the aircraft and not just one area. Aircraft mechanic schools typically last 2 years or so. Military members who maintained aircraft in the service can use that towards the 30 months of required experience. Keep in mind that not all MOS's count towards both airframe and power plant.

, The tests are broken down into 3 tests and 3 sections to each test. General, airframe and power plant. Each one of those sections have a written, oral and practical test. To pass, one must get at least 70% in each section.

Take regular breaks.,
Get to know your coworkers.,
Find little ways to improve your work skills.,
Decide to learn something while you work.,
Work under a different manager.,
Remind yourself what you're working towards.,
Leave your work at work.",How to Enjoy Work1," Studies show that workers who take short breaks more regularly are happier and more productive than workers who take one long break during a shift. If you have any control over the way you take breaks, it's better to give yourself 5-10 minutes every hour or two, instead of an hour off in the middle of the day.It's also important to take time off and stay away from work for a while, as well. Taking some time off helps to energize workers and allow them to come back to work more productive.If you have vacation time, use it. If you don't, allow yourself the occasional ""mental health"" day if you can afford it. Call in sick. It's necessary to help keep yourself happy and productive.;
, If you work with a bunch of strangers, your job will be a lot less enjoyable. Try to get to know a few people at work that you can talk to. This gives you something to look forward to when you clock in for the day.


Try to organize after-work drinks, or birthday celebrations whenever possible. Giving yourself a time to socialize about non-work-related stuff will help you to bring everyone closer together and make your work relationship stronger as well.Avoid coworkers who regularly complain about work, or who try to slack off while you're at work. Hanging with this crowd will always have you feeling bummed to be at work, instead of energized about the day. Try to hang out with the more positive crowd at your job.

, One way to entertain yourself at work is to give yourself little challenges to improve. This will not only keep you in good standing with the management, but will also give you a little challenge in addition. If you're the competitive sort, this can be a great way to motivate you to improve.


Give yourself a work-related challenge in the short term. If you work at a restaurant, aim to get all the prep work done as early in the day as possible. Keep track of your record times. If you're in an office, see how many different spreadsheets you can complete before the day is out.
Stay focused on quality over quantity while you're at work. If you've just started a job making sandwiches, make it your first challenge to make every sandwich perfectly. Then make them without consulting your cheat sheet. Then make them quickly.

, Work doesn't have to be a forced march. Use it as an opportunity to learn something and improve your life, or as a chance to learn something about a particular hobby you have.


Decide to figure out how to do work-related things better. If you don't know how to do something on the computer, decide to learn on your own and then surprise your bosses with your initiative. Take on new responsibilities that will require you to pick up new abilities on the fly. Challenge yourself.
If you can work with headphones and stay focused and productive, try listening to informative podcasts while you work, or audiobooks. Learn something about science from RadioLab or listen to This American Life for some human stories.

, Many people who are unhappy with work are really just unhappy with their bosses. Bad management can affect morale considerably. If you like your job in a general way, but feel like you just don't connect with your manager, ask about transferring or switching your jobs to work under a different superior.


This can be tricky if your manager does the scheduling. Talk to someone in the HR department if you work at an office, to avoid awkwardness. Or just say you're ""looking for a new challenge.""
Sometimes, it might just be a matter of switching shifts. If you can't stand the day manager at the restaurant where you work, switch it up so you're only working in the evenings.

, Work isn't always the most fun thing in the world, which is why you get paid to do it. But keeping steady employment allows you to do things you want to do, or live a certain lifestyle that you enjoy. It gives you independence. Remind yourself of this regularly and make a point of celebrating it.


If you're working at the entry-level for a while, Try to keep in mind that every day you work at that level is another rung closer to the top. Keep climbing the ladder at the company where you work. Keep succeeding and doing the best work you can.
If you're unhappy at your job, but are paid well, just Try to remind yourself what you're saving up for, or how you're using that money to help support yourself and your family. Keep things focused on them.

, If you bring your work home with you, it's like you never leave. Make a point of finishing up your work for the day before you leave, then leaving everything behind. Don't take little things to do with you at your house. Just leave them at home.


Keep separate computers, if at all possible. If you have a work computer, keep your work stuff there. Only use your personal computer for fun things. Don't cross-contaminate them with stuff.
If you work from home, consider creating a separate ""office"" space where you can work, to separate your work and home life. Or head out to a coffee shop or library to do your work separate from where you eat and sleep.

"
Ask for specific expectations.,
Observe other employees.,
Dress formally for interviews.",How to Dress Business Casual1," If you're not sure what your company's policy is, ask the HR rep. Dress more conservatively on the first day if you have no other coworkers to benchmark your attire against.


Business casual is often thrown out there to describe how your employer thinks you should dress at work. The problem is that the expectations of individual companies often differ. For example, one company might want you to dress in business attire, minus a suit coat and tie, while another company may encourage you to wear khakis or jeans. When you are told to dress business casual, it is best to ask for details. Ask if your employer has an employee handbook that more clearly delineates the company's business casual policy.;
, Look around and see what the other employees are wearing; this is a good gauge of what your employer expects when they say business casual.

, If you're going on an interview and you don't know what your interviewer expects you to wear, the standard is business formal. Remember, it's better to be overdressed than underdressed.


Those who are interviewing for a job in business, banking and wealth management, politics, academia, engineering, or health sectors should dress business formal unless otherwise instructed.
If no clothing type is specified, and the company you're interviewing for is outside the sectors listed above, stick with business casual.

Talk to a career counselor.,
Find a job that connects with people more.,
Find a job that allows you to make a difference.,
Find a job that sounds fun.,
Consider going back to school, to give yourself more options.,
Consider going into a trade.,
Switch jobs regularly.",How to Enjoy Work2," Career counselors can be excellent resources if you're unsatisfied with your current job. You can find out about openings in your field, as well as ways that you can translate the work skills you have into other fields. Whatever you do, talking to a career counselor can be a great way of switching jobs.


Career counselors and coaches are available in almost every city. Call one close to you and make an appointment.
Before you visit with a career counselor, it's important to give some thought to what you actually want. What kind of work would make you more happy? What do you think you're equipped for?, If you've been used to working at a computer, locked up in an office, you may be craving work with more human interaction. Try to think about switching to jobs that will allow you more face-time with other people, giving you the chance to socialize.Think about any of the following fields:


Sales
Customer service
Hotel management
Public relations
Event planning
Restaurant management

, If you've been stuck doing something that you think doesn't matter in the grand scheme, you may be craving a job that's part of a higher calling. If you want to make a difference in your world, consider researching jobs in any of the following fields:


Medicine
Education
Social work
Human resources
Law enforcement

, If you find a job doing something that you're passionate about, work will automatically be a lot more enjoyable. How would you spend your work day, ideally? What skills do you have that might translate into a more fun career?These might not be achievable for everybody, but if you've got the right talents and a little luck, here are some fun career options:


Disney World character
Stunt person
Flower arranger
Voice over artist
Video game tester
Wine buyer

, An advanced degree gives you more options. If you have a high school degree, you'll typically qualify for entry level jobs only. Any kind of upper management will require either lots of experience or a degree, but mostly likely you'll need both. Keep working and consider heading back to school to give yourself a chance to move up, or get other kinds of jobs.


Some jobs will require upper-level degrees as a part of advancement, but will pay for your schooling for you. Clerical jobs, manufacturing, and university administration departments will often do this for employees with the right attitude and experience.

, While it sounds nice to say that work needs to be ""your passion"" and that you should ""follow your dreams,"" there's also a good argument for treating it like what it is. A paycheck. There are lots of good jobs available that don't require advanced degrees and lots of networking. Manufacturing, skills-based apprenticeships, and manual labor jobs offer solid paychecks and the ability to be your own boss. Consider finding a laborer to apprentice to, or get on-the-job training as a laborer in any of the following fields:


Bricklayer or mason
Plumber
Carpentry
HVAC
Electrician
Construction worker
Automotive technician

, Where previous generations had life-long careers, people today often must do things a little differently. Having a single job for 40 years and then retiring is a thing of the past in a lot of ways. Consider switching up your employment regularly, instead of staying put. Work somewhere for a couple years, then go elsewhere. Treat it like a hustle.

Don't make work your life.,
Get involved in your community in other ways.,
Spend plenty of time with your friends and family.,
Develop some rewarding hobbies.,
Consider moving.",How to Enjoy Work3," Work is a thing you have to do if you weren't born with a trust fund. For most of us, it's not a lot of fun. But does it need to be? Work doesn't have to be your life. Spend your time at work working, and spend your free time living your life and enjoying yourself. It doesn't need to be a big part of your identity.


""What do you do?"" is a common conversation question among lots of people, but in some cultures it's seen as a rude question. Your work is your business. It doesn't need to define you as a person.

, Join social groups that allow you to meet with all kinds of different people from different social classes and groups. Join a church, or a community organization that will cross cultures and make you feel like you're a part of something bigger and more important than you might feel at work.


Volunteer when you have free time to connect with other people. Volunteer at soup kitchens, animal shelters, and hospitals. Find time to give back and find fulfillment in ways outside of work.

, Your free time should be your own, and should be spent in the presence of loved ones. When you leave work, make a point of spending time with your peers and your family. Have fun.


Sometimes, it's tempting to want to relax with a couple drinks and some television, but Try to make a point of getting active after work too. Spending too much time alone can make it difficult to stay happy.
Don't complain about work too much with your friends and family. It's a common theme, but it can sometimes only serve to keep you focused on how you don't like your job, instead of focusing on things you enjoy doing together.

, If work doesn't leave you feeling fulfilled, use your paychecks to fund your real passions. Don't identify with your job, identify as a record collector, or an aspiring singer, or as a comic-book artist. Work on old guitars in your free time, or sell antiques on eBay. Find hobbies that fulfill you and keep you busy.


Maybe you spend your days working in restaurants, but spend your weekends devoted to your band, or to your novel-in-progress. You don't have to introduce yourself as a cook. You're a musician, or a writer, or an artist.

, When you imagine the perfect working life, it's important to imagine the other intangibles as well. Who do you work with? Where do you work? What do you see out of your office window? In some cases, if you're unhappy at your job, it may be that a change of scenery might be in order.


Working at a restaurant in Tulsa might be dragging you down, but what if you were working at a restaurant in Houston? Or New Orleans? Consider moving to a culinary capital.

As with men, black and grey are more formal, making for a safer bet.
Avoid low-cut dresses or those with high slits.
Avoid dresses (especially) and skirts that are more skin-tight.
No sundresses.

,


No jeans, unless otherwise noted. If jeans are allowed by your employer, distressed jeans, jeans with holes, and ""boyfriend"" jeans are not desirable choices.
Neutral colors are best.

, Women have a few more options in this department than the men. Opt for conservative and not too revealing. Blouses, plain shirts, cotton shirts, sweaters, turtlenecks, vests, and sleeveless shirts are all acceptable.


Tucked-in or untucked can both go, depending on the shirt.
Unusual patterns are acceptable, as long as they are not wild. The standard, however, is a monotone shirt.
Use a collar for a more formal look, and collarless shirts for a less formal look.

, Avoid flip flops, sandals and sneakers.


Heels are okay, so long as they aren't too conspicuous.

, Remember dress socks or pantyhose (with skirts or dresses) and tastefully accessorize with light jewelry and a simple purse.

, Ask yourself the following set of questions if you're still not sure whether your outfit is acceptable.Would I wear this clubbing? The answer should be 'no.'

Would I wear this to sleep? The answer should be 'no.'

Would I wear this to do yard work? The answer should be 'no.'

Would I wear this to a costume party? The answer should be 'no.'

Choose shirts that have collars, such as long-sleeve button down shirts.,
Wear pants styles such as khakis, dress pants, trousers and corduroy pants.,
Consider pairing your shirt with a sweater or sweater vest.,
Select formal leather shoes, and don’t forget the dress socks.,
Study the list of don'ts.",How to Dress Business Casual3," Always tuck the shirt in and pair the shirt with an appropriate belt. For business casual, tie is optional.


White button-down shirts are the most formal and therefore the safest. Unlike pants, all manner of shirt colors are acceptable: Purple, pink, yellow, blue, and red.
Choose shirts (and pants) in ""formal"" fabric: Cotton is king, and comes in many different flavors. Wool is acceptable, if itchy. Silk, rayon, and linen are frowned upon.
Choose shirts in ""formal patterns: Oxford, plaid, and poplin are a little less formal, but perfectly acceptable. Twill, herringbone, and broadcloth patterns are more formal and nice to use if sprucing up.Hawaiian and other irregular patterns are considered too casual.

, Jeans are not considered business casual.


Pleated pants and dark colors are more formal, conservative choices. If you want to be on the safe side, overdressing is less frowned upon than underdressing.
Pants should extend to the top of your shoe, or slightly longer. Pants that don't reach down to your shoe are considered high-water pants; pants that fold and bunch up near the feet are considered too baggy.
Avoid pants in loud colors such as red, yellow, and purple. Camouflage is not allowed, neither are white pants — they feel a little too informal for even business casual. Stick with black, brown, grey, khaki, dark blue and dark green pants.

, V-neck sweaters work best if wearing a a collar.


Turtlenecks can be worn in combination with a blazer for a sleek look and a little bit of novelty.
If you want to wear a suit coat and still look business casual, dress it down with khakis instead of suit pants.

, Stick to black, brown, or grey shoes. Oxfords, lace-ups, and loafers are all standards.

, Avoid the following items, which, fortunately or unfortunately, don't fall under the category of business casual:


Sneakers, sandals, flip-flops or other open-toed shoes.
Sports shirts, sweatshirts, sport team jackets, and athletic socks.
Shorts and capris.
Jeans.
Very tight, and hence revealing, cuts of pants. No skinny-trousers allowed, even for Europeans.

If you have last-minute problems, then you'll be able to take care of them before you go on vacation. You don't want to inhibit the work of others, cut into your vacation, or leave anything unfinished when you go.


If it is not possible to finish a project, write up a plan for how you intend to work on the project upon your return.;
, You may have put in the proper paperwork, formally requesting time off, but your co-workers might not know that you're leaving. By letting them know you're going on vacation, you give them a chance to coordinate with you. They might have something they need you to do, and by letting them know ahead of time, you avoid tying up the work of others.

, If you work a little harder before you go on vacation, you can get ahead of yourself. That way you won't have more to do when you get back. If you do a lot of work before you go, you might even be able to give yourself an easy first week back. , If you're leaving for vacation on a Friday, don't take the whole day off if you don't have to. It might be a little bit of extra hassle to work half a day and then travel, but it can lighten the load when you get back.

, This will help you to fully make use of your time off. It will also enhance your anticipation, which can increase vacation satisfaction.The last thing you want is to go on vacation, but feel like you can't help but think of work. It is hard to break the habit of thinking about what you have to do all the time, but if you don't give your brain a break, you won't get the benefit of the time off.


Take a day to turn off your electronics. This can get you ready to disconnect for your time off.
Go to a day spa, to prepare yourself to relax.
Schedule a weekend where you can practice not thinking about work.

, Sometimes people feel that they are the only ones who can do their job. Sometimes people feel they have to do everything themselves. When you're going on vacation it may be necessary to let go of this mentality. Give some tasks that you might normally do to other people. A well-staffed business should be more than capable of absorbing your workload., Some people have to remain somewhat connected while they're on vacation. If you're unable to fully break away from work when you're off, limit your work to a small window of time. Take an hour in the morning to do some minor work-related things. But just make sure that you're limiting how much access you have at work during other times of the day., Ignore your e-mail. Avoid sending out a text to check in on your co-workers. Working on vacation measurably reduces the benefit of your time off.Turn on the auto-response feature on your e-mail, so you can automatically reply to correspondences with a message informing people you will not be in the office. This is your first line of defense.Set your voicemail to explain that you're on vacation.
Ask a coworker to keep you updated if you know someone who doesn't mind the task, that way you can look at all the e-mails right before you go back, but you don't feel the need to constantly check.
Make sure to tell people when you're going to be back.

, Our sleep habits tend to drift on vacation. Make sure you go to bed at the same time you do when you have to go to work. Do this a couple days leading up to the end of your time off. If you're not on vacation very long, then make sure you don't get off your sleep schedule. If it proves difficult to immediately adjust back to your normal habits, do it slowly, adjusting in smaller increments.Divide the difference in hours between your vacation sleep time and your work day sleep time over the number of days you intend to adjust your sleep schedule.
If you normally go to be at 11:00pm, but you're finding yourself up until 3am during your vacation, you will have four hours to adjust.
With two days to change your schedule, go to sleep two hours earlier the first day, at 1am. Then, on the second day go to bed two hours earlier than that, at 11pm.
This will be an easier transition the more days you give yourself to recover.

, Though the positive benefits on health and well-being from going on vacation fade quickly, it is crucial to use your time off for its intended purpose. Vacation does a lot to keep you healthy, both physically and mentally. If you're not taking advantage of your time off to relax, you're not really letting yourself be on vacation. , Give yourself a couple days to adjust to your daily life. Many times people come back from vacation, they wind up feeling like they need a vacation from their vacation. Avoid this exhaustion by giving yourself a few days to relax at home before you get back to work., Don't throw yourself in full-force, or double-time. This can be a shock, and cause you to become overly stressed. If you fry yourself working too hard, you'll hurt the quality of your work. The quality and quantity of leisure time post-vacation can help lessen the decline in health and well-being benefits from your vacation., Don't go work a double-shift on your first day back. Don't spend time outside of your hours doing extra work. First days back can be difficult. It can be hard to focus and you might find yourself easily exhausted by tasks. By limiting how much time and access you give yourself to work activities, you can make sure you don't burn yourself out. This can impact your productivity and the quality of your work.

, Though your first day can be rough, you will still be experiencing the positive benefits of your vacation on your first day off. These will rapidly decline back down to baseline by the end of the week.Use the boost in the middle of the week, so that you can take it easy on Friday, leave a little early, or even come in just a half day.

, Make sure you contact all the necessary people right away. Find out what you missed while you were away. Get the news from people. Socializing can be a great way to get work done, without taxing yourself too much. It will also help ensure that you do not miss out on anything important.

Invest in tile, hardwood or laminate floors if possible.,
Remove and roll up any nice carpets and rugs.,
Buy a cheap, washable rug for your office floor.,
Get a portable carpet cleaner.,
Stock up on pet-friendly floor cleaners.,
Place office supplies and documents in out-of-reach places.",How to Dog Proof Your Office Space1," Dogs, especially puppies, have accidents from time to time. While dogs that are not housebroken can urinate or defecate on the floor, even adult dogs have accidents from time to time. This can range from bathroom accidents to vomiting. Having a floor surface that can be easily cleaned will save you lots of headaches when your dog has an accident., If your office space has carpets and rugs, remove them or roll them up if possible. This will make cleaning up much easier when your puppy decides to go potty on the office floor.

, Sometimes hardwood and tile floors are cold, and you may need a rug to keep your feet warm while your work. If this is this case, don’t spend a ton of money on a fancy rug. Instead purchase a cheaper rug and, if possible, one that is machine washable. This will make cleaning up accidents easier. It will also be a little easier to digest your dog making dinner out of your floor coverings., If you have ever experienced a dog accident on a carpeted surface, you know how difficult it can be to remove the resulting stains and odors. A portable or handheld carpet cleaner can make cleanup a cinch. Try borrowing or buying one made specifically for cleaning up pet messes., When nature calls and your dog doesn’t make it through the doggy door, having a floor cleaner specially formulated to deal with doggy accidents will give you some peace of mind. You can find these in the pet supply section of most grocery or pet stores. You can also find a wide variety of options from online merchants.

, Removing electronics cords, pencils, markers, paper, and important documents and files from within a dog’s reach will help prevent your pooch from chowing down on irreplaceable or expensive items. Place these items high on shelves where your dog can’t reach, even if she does her best bouncing exercise."

Consider how permanent the relationship is.,
Determine if the work performed is part of your regular business.,
Check if the worker has their own employees.,
Find out if the worker operates under a business name.,
Determine who pays for the worker’s supplies.,
Ask if the worker has other clients.,
Look at how the worker is paid.,
Check if you set the worker’s hours.,
Review the worker’s level of skill.,
Check the termination provisions in your contracts.,
Weigh the totality of the circumstances.,
Meet with a lawyer.",How to Distinguish Employees from Non‐Employees1," Federal law considers the permanency of the relationship when determining whether the worker is an employee or independent contractor.The more permanent the relationship, then the more likely the worker is an employee instead of an independent contractor.


The person does not need to work for you all of the time. However, if he or she works for frequently recurring intervals, then the worker is more like an employee.;
, You might run a catering service. As part of this business, you make and serve food at parties. If the worker makes appetizers for you, then her work is part of your regular business. In this situation, the worker is more like an employee than an independent contractor.


If the worker performs only occasional work for you, then she is probably an independent contractor. For example, the owner of the catering business occasionally hires her accountant to look over contracts, prepare tax returns, and answer tax questions. This occasional use suggests that the accountant is an independent contractor., An independent contractor is more likely to have his or her own employees working under them.For example, if the worker outsources part of their work, then this factor would support finding an independent contractor relationship.

, Where a worker has incorporated and provides services under the business name, then it is more likely that she is an independent contractor than an employee. You should go through your records and see if the worker listed her business on a resume or in an email when you hired her.


Also look to see if the worker has a separate business checking account. This factor will weigh in favor of someone being an independent contractor.
An independent contractor will also keep her own business records.However, if you are responsible for maintaining the records, then the worker looks more like an employee.

, If the worker pays for his own tools or supplies, then he is more likely an independent contractor than an employee.Look through your invoices. If you are reimbursing the worker for supplies, then this factor might weigh in favor of an employer-employee relationship.

, An independent contractor will probably have more than one client.You should ask how many other clients the worker has.


The more clients a worker has, then the more likely that he is an independent contractor. For example, a dentist may see over 100 patients in a month. Because he does work for so many different customers, then he is not the employee of any of them.
By contrast, a worker might work only for you. If you are the sole client, then it is more likely that the worker is an employee and not an independent contractor., When someone invoices you for work performed, then they are more like an independent contractor than an employment.However, if you pay the worker an hourly wage regardless of how much work is performed, then the worker looks like an employee.

, When you tell the person when to work, then you are acting like an employer. Accordingly, if you set the worker’s hour, then this is some evidence that he or she is an employee and not an independent contractor.


You may exercise other forms of control over the employee. For example, you could try to dictate where the work is performed. This type of control weighs in favor of the worker being an employee.
In particular, if you require that the worker perform work at your jobsite, then the worker is more like an employee than an independent contractor.Another aspect of control is requiring the worker to issue regular reports, whether written or oral., This is another factor to consider. The more highly skilled the person, the more likely he is to be an independent contractor.


An unskilled or semi-skilled individual is more likely an employee.Look at the tasks you have the person perform. Don’t rely solely on the job description, which may not accurately reflect the work that the person is performing.

, If you are able to fire the worker at will, then he or she is more like an employee. Also, if the worker can quit for any reason at any time, then the worker is more like an employee.Independent contractors, by contrast, cannot be let go for any reason so long as they fulfill the obligations in their contract.

, There is no bright-line test for whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor. For example, the worker could have her own business but still qualify as an independent contractor if she works only for you and you dictate her hours and where she can work.


Instead, look at all of the factors above. This is a subjective analysis. Trust your gut and ask which way the totality of evidence tilts: does it lean a little more in favor of an independent contractor or an employee?
If you are worried about the government classifying a worker as an employee, then you should try to change the work relationship. For example, you should stop setting the work hours for the person and start requiring that the worker invoice you for work performed. You could also stop reimbursing people for supplies.

, This is a very complicated area of law. If you have questions about whether a worker qualifies as an employee, then you should meet with a lawyer.


You can find a qualified employment attorney by visiting your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program. For more tips, see Find an Employment Lawyer.
Also realize that some government agencies use different tests for determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor.The factors listed above are used by most states and federal agencies; however, each agency could weigh the evidence differently.
Accordingly, an employee might be classified by the IRS as an independent contractor but by your state unemployment agency as an employee. To truly know the status of your worker, schedule a consultation with an attorney.

Don’t place anything important on low-lying shelves.,
Avoid bare wood furniture if possible.,
Choose leather and microfiber fabric for furniture.,
Consider a couch cover.",How to Dog Proof Your Office Space2," If you keep your office briefs on the last shelf of your bookshelf, move them to the highest shelf. Items that make good chew toys easily intrigue dogs, especially puppies. This, unfortunately, can lead to your client’s last will and testament being turned into an afternoon snack.

, Dogs like to chew and bare wood is especially appetizing for some, especially young puppies that are still learning the ropes. Office chairs with metal legs, for example, might be a better choice than your grandfather’s antique office chair., Both leather and microfiber are pet-friendly. Leather couches and chairs can be cleaned easily by simply wiping down the surface to remove pet hair. Microfiber furniture coverings can also be cleaned easily with a lint roller, and are designed to repel pet wetting., If your office has couches, chairs, or other furniture that Fluffy might find particularly intriguing for her afternoon nap, consider covering the upholstery with a budget-friendly and machine washable furniture cover. This will make removing pet hair a breeze and you won’t have to worry about your Rottweiler ruining your favorite recliner.

Learn how to behave.,
Learn the skills necessary to maintain yourself and excel.,
Work ethically.,
Be formal.,
Be good at what you do.,
Be respectful.,
Be punctual.,
Don't get emotional.,
Be a team player.",How to Develop Professionalism," Personality is what most people will look for when meeting anyone whether making a friend or meeting an employer. Your personality is by far the most influential aspect when it comes to being professional. Some essential qualities in a professional personality tend to include the following.


Being formal – Acting properly in the appropriate setting.
Respectful – Giving regards to those rewarded by their abilities, qualities, & achievements.
Consistent – Able to provide the same amount of efficiency in your work
Knowledgeable – Intelligent and well-informed;
, In order to function properly as a professional, you have to be able to communicate efficiently. The most important part is being able to listen. Listening is an excellent skill that allows you to understand and take interest in what others say. It allows information to be exchanged easier and it is a skill sought out among all employees, no matter the profession. As important as it is to listen to others, you should also know when to voice yourself. Allow others to hear your decisions and opinions and you may be rewarded for your hard work and efforts. Communication is the key to your success no matter where you are in life.

, Looking the part is important to being professional. If everyone is in suits, you should be in a suit as well. You should dress to match the appropriate professional background you're trying to fit into.

, You'll easily be viewed as immature and irresponsible if you're not able to maintain maturity in the area of work. This means you shouldn't play around and you should take your work seriously. Some ideal ways to behave may include the following.


Do your work - You’ll want to remain a hard worker who is efficient and reliable.
Be disciplined – Follow rules and do what is expected of you.
Don’t get personal – It’s not professional to mix your personal life with your work life.
Cooperate – It’s in your best interest to work well with those around you.

, There are a lot of personal skills along with technical skills that are required to remain as a professional. Some personal skills may be ethicality, responsibility, and diligence while some technical skills may be communications, service, and other profession-related skills. For example, if you're a working in IT, you should have a good knowledge on computer software and programming.

, Professional ethics is defined as the personal and corporate rules that govern behavior within the context of a particular profession. Professionals are always being questioned for their choices whether they are ethical or not. In fact, this controversy is what may define someone as a professional. Professionals work morally and developing a sense of good ethics will come a long way. An example of professional ethics is the American Bar Association’s set of ethical rules that govern an attorney’s moral obligations.

, To be formal is to do things in accordance with a set of rules or etiquette. This etiquette must be suitable for the situation or occasion. To be formal, you’ll want to be respectable, well-mannered, and abiding to the general standards set beforehand. In most cases, this means being serious, emotionless, and to speak properly as well.

, It's important to take your work seriously and what is expected of you. Your competency will determine a great deal of how well you can handle life as a professional. Do your work not only to complete but to excel. People will look at you with a higher regard when you’re good at what you do. Be efficient while being consistent with all that you do.

, Always show respect to those around you whether they're your superiors or whether you're their superior. The goal is treat everyone with respect and soon, people will show you respect. Treat those how you want to be treated. Surely, in order to gain great respect, you must be prepared to give it. The results may not be immediate but over time, there will be progress.

, Time is of the essence. As a very scarce and important resource, employers value those who keep track of themselves and will find punctuality to be a highly appreciated trait. Create a habit of being on time. This means if you’re waking up too late, try sleeping earlier. If you’re suddenly delayed by an obstacle, try your best to anticipate it. You’ll want to avoid being late to anything because it’ll show how irresponsible you can be.

, Part of being professional is being able to separate your personal matters apart from your work life. This involves being able to remain calm and level-headed through obstacles and challenges that arise. There are good and bad emotions that arise in a professional workplace. Some good emotions include happiness, gratitude, interest, and pride while some bad emotions you’ll want to avoid are sadness, frustration, nervousness, and stubbornness.

, People rarely work alone nowadays. People have worked together since the beginning of time in order to get what they want. Nothing has changed about that and you’ll need other people to get what you want. The same can be said vice versa. Give and you shall receive. There is no such thing as an independent person so help those around you and they’ll help you.

Negotiate.",How to Determine What Salary to Ask for," There are many websites that contain salary information. Look at the following places, depending on your job:


Online job boards such as Indeed.com and Craigslist often contain salary information.Find equivalent jobs in your area.
You can use a salary calculator, such as PayScale, Monster.com, or Salary.com. Enter the job title and its location.Non-profit job seekers should visit guidestar.com to find nonprofit tax reports. These reports often contain salary information for key employees.;
, Other people working in your industry will have more accurate information than a website. Ask around. Also check whether they know the compensation policy of the company you are negotiating with.For example, some businesses might traditionally offer above-market salaries. You’ll want to know this ahead of time.


You can meet people at trade shows, seminars, and professional association meetings.Do some research ahead of time to see that they do an equivalent job or work with someone who does.
You might feel uncomfortable asking outright how much someone gets paid. However, you can talk about your situation and ask, “Does this range sound about right for the company?”

, They might have performed a recent salary survey of businesses in the field. Ask if you can see this information. Even if they don’t share it with you, you can ask them whether your expected salary range is reasonable.Some surveys are online. For example, the HigherEdJobs website has multiple salary surveys for university employees, including administrators, professionals, and faculty., Recruiters handle salary negotiations regularly, so they should have a good read on what is a realistic salary.Call one up and schedule a lunch.


Explain the position you are negotiating for and check whether your salary expectations are reasonable. You can say something like, “I have an interview for a marketing director position at ABC Corp. I want to ask for $80,000 but don’t know what the market rate is here in Chicago. Does that sound in the ballpark?”

, Government agencies make their salaries public, so you can usually find this information with the click of a mouse. Find equivalent positions at public universities or in the government.You might not be able to find a government job that is an exact match. However, it will give you a rough guide. For example, you might be applying for a job as a project manager at a company. In this situation, you can find the salary for a project coordinator at a local university.
Some government salaries might be higher than the market rate, so use this information along with information from salary calculators.

, The market rate is appropriate for an average employee in the position. However, you might have been a star performer at your old job. In this situation, you should expect to command a higher salary than someone who is merely competent. Assess your past accomplishments, such as the following:


Did you increase revenue? Identify how much money you made for the company. When you negotiate, you need facts and figures to back up your requested salary. For example: “I increased Melissa’s Cupcakes sales by 270% in my first six months, so I think an above-market salary is appropriate.”
Did you save your company money? For example, you might have retained all the key staff in your department, or you might have installed a new record-keeping system that reduced the use of paper.
Did you increase client satisfaction? As the head of your company’s customer service department, you might have spearheaded a campaign to increase customer satisfaction. If your company gathered survey data, then find it. During your salary negotiations, you can say something like, “I know $45,000 is a little above the market rate, but I did increase Everywhere Cellular’s customer satisfaction score from 55% to 94%.”

, If you have 10 years of experience in an equivalent position, then you can ask more than someone who is just starting out in the business.Make sure your experience is in the same type of job. You might have 15 years of experience working in human resources, but that’s not relevant for a job as an elementary school teacher.


Of course, experience can only boost your pay up to a point. If you’ve worked 35 years in a job, you won’t get paid more than the company CEO simply because of your experience.

, Education matters, so compare your education to the requested education for the job. If you exceed the required amount, then you can usually ask for more money. It also matters where you went to school.A degree from a top program is worth more than a degree from a mediocre school.


Also look at your certifications. For example, an accounting job might prefer someone who is a CPA. If you don’t have that designation, you may have to accept a salary on the lower end of the pay scale.
On the other hand, you may have a certification when one isn’t required, which means you can request a salary on the high end of the pay scale.

, Employees who work all night usually make more than someone who works a day shift.Adjust the market rate if you work a night shift to account for this difference.


An employer is not required to give you more for working the night shift.However, some employers offer about 10-15% more.

, Chances are you have a good idea of the salary you need to change jobs. Gather all available data, but then spend some time thinking about what you want. Data is useful, but it doesn’t fully address your circumstances.


For example, you might not be in a place right now where you want to change jobs. However, you might consider switching if the salary is high enough. Regardless of what the data is telling you, you need to ask for an amount that will induce you to join the company.
Alternately, you might have interviewed with your dream employer, a company you’d love to work for. In that situation, you might be perfectly happy accepting a salary below the market rate. Use the market data to get a sense of what the employer thinks is reasonable, even if you are willing to settle for less.

, The bottom of the range should be the absolute minimum you are willing to work for, and the top number will be your target, which should be about 10-25% higher.The midpoint should be what you think you are worth.


For example, your range might be $36,000-44,000. In this situation, you won’t take the job unless you get at least $36,000. You’d love to get $44,000 and think you are worth $40,000.
Research indicates that women tend to undervalue their worth.You can avoid this by trusting the data you have gathered on market salaries. There’s no reason to undervalue yourself.

, Salary is only one part of a comprehensive compensation package. The employer you negotiate with might not be able to meet your salary demands, but they might offer fringe benefits, such as a company car or more vacation time.An employer might also be able to provide better health insurance benefits or match more of your contributions to a retirement plan. These benefits can make a big difference in your standard of living.
Don’t get locked into a certain amount of salary and forget that fringe benefits can increase your overall compensation.

, In a negotiation, you need to do more than throw around numbers. Instead, you need to justify your demands. Think about the reasons why you are worth more than the market rate: experience, demonstrated results, education, etc., Most of us are not natural negotiators, so it’s okay to be nervous. You can prepare for negotiation by doing a practice run. Ask a friend to play the role of the employer. Meet at a neutral location, such as the library, so that you will take the practice seriously.


You should practice different negotiation styles. For example, some negotiators have a hard-style and tend to say “no” quite easily. The key is to avoid getting rattled. Instead, work on maintaining a positive attitude and explaining why you want the salary you have requested.Also prepare for the soft-style negotiator. They are easy to negotiate with—too easy, in fact. You might find that you want the soft-style negotiator to like you so much that you are willing to settle for a lower salary.

, Try to delay discussion. Instead, you want to sell yourself as a candidate. Once they see how skilled you are, they may be willing to offer a higher salary.


Deflect salary discussions by saying something like, “Before we talk about salary, I’d like to hear more about your expansion plans.”

, If you went first and gave a lower number, then you might end up with a lower salary. However, if the first number is too low, you should counteroffer based on your research.


There’s also a benefit to going first. In particular, you can “anchor” the negotiation around the numbers you propose.It becomes harder to negotiate away from the anchor, so you are more likely to get a salary close to what you want. If you go first, propose the high-end of your salary range.

, Negotiation involves back and forth. Don’t accept the first offer put on the table simply because you are afraid of negotiating. Instead, prepare your counteroffer and the reasoning behind it.For example, your salary range might have been $36,000-44,000. The employer offers the low end. Avoid immediately accepting. Instead, say something like, “I think based on the results I’ve achieved in my current job, I am looking for something closer to $44,000.” In this example, you have provided a reason why you are entitled to the higher salary.
Don’t forget fringe benefits as you negotiate. You might reach an impasse—you want more money but the employer doesn’t have any more to give. At this point, you can talk about fringe benefits such as extra vacation days or a flexible work schedule that lets you work from home.
Never take negotiations personally.This is about business. Remember that an employer who can’t match your salary expectations isn’t insulting you. They might just not have the money.

Check if the internship is related to a university.,
Confirm that the internship is for the intern’s benefit.,
Check that the intern hasn’t replaced an employee.,
Identify why you are training the intern.,
Calculate how long the internship is.,
Check your agreement about wages.,
Weigh the factors.",How to Distinguish Employees from Non‐Employees2," If the internship is overseen by a college or university, which provides educational credit, then the person working is more like an intern than an employee.Where the internship is unrelated to a university or college, then it is more like employment, and the intern could really be an employee who must be paid a wage.

, The internship should also provide general skills and not training in work specific to the employer. In this way, the intern is gaining skills which she can take to a different employer.


However, where an intern is doing work specifically for the employer, such as answering phones or filing, then he or she could qualify as an employee and not an intern.In this situation, the internship is benefiting the employer.

, If you use an intern to replace an employee, then the intern is more like an employee. Also, if you use interns as extra help during certain times of the year, then the intern is more like an employee.For example, if a store hires interns only during peak shopping season, then the relationship looks more like employment than an internship. In particular, the work relationship appears to be for the benefit of the employer, who is busy during the shopping season.

, Many internships require training, with an experienced worker training the intern. You should identify the purpose of this training.


If the training is for the intern’s knowledge—and you do not require that the intern put this training to use by doing work for you—then the arrangement is more like an internship. A common situation would be “job shadowing,” where the intern follows an employee around without doing much work.Instead, the primary purpose of the shadowing is to learn.
However, when you supervise a worker in the same manner as you would an employee, then the relationship looks like an employer-employee relationship.

, An internship should have a fixed length. The end point should be determined before the intern starts working. Additionally, the internship should not be a “trial run” where the intern works for free before you decide whether to hire him or her.The intern’s expectations are a critical component. When the intern expects an offer of employment after the internship, then it is probably not an internship.

, The unpaid intern should not expect compensation.You should have some sort of agreement in which you state that the intern will not be paid.

, These factors must all be weighed. There is no simple bright-line test for determining if a person is an intern or an employee.


If, after weighing all of the circumstances, you do not know whether the person is an intern or employee, then you should speak to an attorney. You don’t want to fail to pay an employee wages he or she is entitled to.

, There may be local schools or agencies that already provide certain training components or certification programs. Partnering is often an efficient way to meet the needs of participants while simultaneously gaining access to new groups of potential program participants.

, Recruit participants by offering free or low-cost training. A pilot program will allow you to make necessary program changes based on observed outcomes.

, Ask program attendees to explain whether or not the program met their training and workforce placement needs. Questions might address the quality of instruction, relevance of program content and clarity of program expectations.

You can then rest assured that your pup will be preoccupied when you take that conference call., For those who want to work beside their pets, having an ample supply of food, treats, and water can keep your pet preoccupied. Your dog will be less likely to go after your lunch or afternoon snack if she has a meal of her own waiting by the bookshelf.


Keep food and water messes at bay by placing your dog’s food and water bowl on a rug or plastic mat made specifically for dog bowls.

Start with the basics.,
Know your budget and stick to it.,
In the case of high heels ... Only wear heels if your workplace doesn't do anything active.,
Have a large selection handy.,
Don't take advantage of ""Dress Down Day"".",How to Dress in the Workplace," This may include sophisticated pencil skirts, cowl neck sweaters, scoop-necked tops, and cashmere cardigans. You don't want to wear the same thing everyday, so make sure you have at least three bottoms (preferably skirts if you're a woman) and four or more tops.;
, Having an appropriate apparel selection doesn't have to cost you a fortune. Look in stores such as Sears, the Bay, and Winners. If you have the money to spend, look in stores such as Ralph Lauren, Saks Fifth Avenue, Holt Renfrew, Neiman Marcus, Barneys, etc.

, If you're not expected to be running up and down staircases all day or teaching a gym class, feel free to wear them. But if you are, be prepared to have your heels snap or your feet ache.

, Having a large selection of suits available saves a lot in the long run. Ideally, one very nice, expensive suit and two cheaper, not-so-nice suits is perfect. Don't spend all your money on suits, and don't wear suits everyday -- wear suits to important meetings and interviews.

, Even if Fridays are ""Dress Down Days"", don't take advantage of said day. Taking advantage only makes you look sloppy and tacky. If you must, dress down by toning down the makeup and removing your pearl necklace, but don't go overboard by wearing light-wash, torn jeans and a tank.

Consider functionality.,
Take into account the taste of the executive.,
Leave room for honors, awards and diplomas.,
Choose a color scheme that is appealing.,
Remember storage.",How to Decorate an Executive Office,"


The design for an executive office should be welcoming, but also be practical for what it is going to be used for. For example, a couch is a nice thing to have, but only if the executive really has a need for it. You don't want to take up room with fancy furniture and other items that aren't really necessary to have in the office -- even if they look nice.;
,


If the executive has traditional taste, don't give him or her a contemporary office. No matter what the design of the other offices in the company, the executive should have a space where he or she feels comfortable and where production is the most important thing, not the style of the office. The executive will be the one spending the most time in the room, so it should reflect at least some of who he or she is.

,


Executives have worked hard to get where they are and they have the honors to show it. Not only do executives want to display their achievements, but clients, and potential clients, want to see them. Seeing the credentials of someone you are doing business with can give confidence to those seeking the company's expertise as well as solidify for current clients that they have made the right decision.
Honors, awards and diplomas can go on surface areas as well as the walls. It is beneficial to the executive design process to check with the executive about what types of things he or she has to display so you can allot the appropriate space for them.

,


Executives will likely be meeting with many types of people in their offices. The color scheme should be something that is warm and welcoming to anyone. Nice, warm neutral tones are a good choice to give the office some color, but aren't overwhelming. A neutral color palette is also very easy to match when it comes to furniture, carpeting and decorations.

,


Don't forget to leave enough space for filing cabinets, shelving and bookcases to allow the executive plenty of space to stay organized. It is easy to get wrapped up in the aesthetics of the office, but it is important to remember that someone needs to work in this space. Again, consulting the executive about the type of organizational system he or she prefers will save time..

Know the employer's rights during a strike.",How to Create a Union at Work," In the U.S., federal and state law protects such rights as the right to form a union, to express views on unions, and to talk to coworkers about an interest in forming a union.You may be excluded from coverage of the law if you are a supervisor or other employee expressly excluded from coverage in the law., The AFL-CIO is an umbrella organization that brings together unions across the United States. It is a federation of unions that can help your union during formation and thereafter. The AFL-CIO has ""local and state councils where unions come together to work toward common goals."", If forming a union is not an option for you, consider the alternative option of becoming a part of a union movement by joining Working America.Working America is the AFL-CIO's affiliate organization for those individuals who do not have a union at work but would still like to be involved in a union movement., In order to begin organizing a union, you should begin by talking to your colleagues at work to determine if they might be interested in forming a union., When introducing the idea of forming a union to your coworkers, do so discreetly and preferably in the absence of a supervisor or other member of management.This is important because although you have a right to form a union, many employers do not look favorably upon the idea of their employees forming a union and may, therefore, try to thwart your attempt to form one.

, If, after quietly talking to your coworkers, you find that enough of them are interested, hold a private meeting with your coworkers. At this meeting, discuss the particular workplace issues that you feel need addressing.Keep a record of the issues discussed at this meeting for future reference.

, Once you have finished preliminary discussions with your colleagues, begin building an organizing committee. This process involves identifying leaders who will represent all major departments and all shifts at your workplace and leaders who will, ideally, reflect the racial, ethnic, and gender diversity at your place of work., Members of the organization committee will require training on educating themselves about the union and educating other coworkers about both the union and the anti-union campaign from the management that will likely follow. Organizing committee members will also require education on workers’ rights in your particular jurisdiction., You will also need, at this stage, to gather important information about your workplace for future reference. This information includes:


workplace structure: departments, areas of work, shifts, jobs.employee information: name, address, phone, shift, job title, and department for each worker.employer information: other locations, parent company, product(s), customers, union history., Leading up to an election, you will need to begin to adopt an issues program, which is a program of union demands. The union demands are those improvements that you are trying to achieve at your workplace. The issues program can be brought to your coworkers attention through various campaign activities., Ask your coworkers to sign union membership cards. Your goal is to get a sizeable majority of your coworkers to sign a membership card. These cards are necessary in order to hold a union election., The signed union membership cards are then used to petition the labor board to hold a union election.Although an election is not necessary if the employer is willing to recognize the union based on the results of the card campaign (""a card check""), you will need to participate in an election if your employer declines to recognize the union in this manner. To do so, you will send a petition to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to hold an election.The NLRB will take several weeks to schedule the election and determine voter eligibility. During this time, you can continue the union campaignOnce the election is held and the union wins, your employer must recognize and then bargain with the union., Once your union is formed and the goal you set out to achieve has been achieved, your next goal should be to negotiate a union contract with your employer. This union contract will be the document that the employer and the union signs. This document will cover wages, dispute resolution, and other employment related matters. To negotiate a contract requires the union to mobilize in support of the union’s demands and requires pressuring your employer to meet those demands., A right to work law protects the rights of employees not to be coerced into joining a union or providing the union financial support. Be aware of these laws during your union campaign and beyond, especially if you live in a right to work state, as you do not want to be in violation of the law., Relevant to the concept of forming a union is a right to strike. Remember, however, that although as an employee you have a right to strike, not all strikes are legal. Some strikes, such as those in protest of an unfair labor practice by the employer, are legal and are protected by the National Labor Relations Act.However, some collective bargaining agreements that unions enter into with employers contain a ""no-strike"" clause. With a few exceptions, violating a no-strike clause is illegal., Although the National Labor Relations Act protects the right to strike, your employer is allowed by law to hire replacement workers during the strike. Once the strike is over, your right to reinstatement depends on the reason for the strike.If the strike was in protest of an unfair labor practice, then you cannot be permanently replaced or fired. After the strike is over, you have a right to be reinstated even if it means that the replacement employees have to be let go.If your strike was for economic reasons, you will have fewer reinstatement rights. You cannot be fired in that scenario but you can be replaced. If the employer has hired permanent replacements while you were on strike, you will not be entitled to immediate reinstatement but will have a right to be reinstated as when when a job opening arises."

Close the office door.,
Use a dog or baby gate.,
Train your dog to stay out of the office.",How to Dog Proof Your Office Space4," For some people, dog proofing your office means keeping your pooch completely out of the office. If you’re not thrilled about having a canine co-worker, keeping the door to your office closed tight will ensure you can work without Fido at your feet.

, A great way to keep your pet out of the office is to place a gate in the doorway. You can buy a dog-specific gate for your office. If you don’t want to invest in a new gate, you can always use a baby gate that you already have. Keep the gate positioned in the doorway at all times to ensure the dog does not enter your office.

, If you don’t want to close the door or put up a gate to prevent the dog from entering your office, you can always train your pet to stay away from the office space. Try telling your pet to “halt” when he gets near the office door. Then ask him to “sit” and “stay.” If your dog abides by these commands, give him a treat for his good behavior.

Maintain consistent termination procedures.",How to Defend Yourself in a Wrongful Termination Lawsuit," The complaint and summons provide important information about the lawsuit against you, such as the name of the court and the person suing you and how long you have to respond.Check the date when the employee was terminated. If it was a long time ago, the case might not have been filed within the appropriate statute of limitations – which provides a deadline before which a lawsuit can be filed.You also should check the court where the lawsuit was filed. If it's far away from your place of business, it may not have jurisdiction over the lawsuit.You also should consider subject matter jurisdiction. Generally, if the employee is suing under federal law, he or she must file the lawsuit in federal court. Likewise, wrongful termination lawsuits under state law typically should be filed in state court.;
, Depending on the size of your company, you may need to let others know about the lawsuit, such as ownership partners or the manager who terminated the employee.


At the least, you will need to talk to the manager who terminated the employee suing you, as well as his or her direct supervisor and anyone in your human resources department who processed the employee's paperwork.

, In a wrongful termination suit, you need an experienced employer defense attorney, especially considering that the employee is likely to be represented by counsel.Plaintiffs typically request jury trials in wrongful termination lawsuits, since juries tend to be sympathetic to the plaintiff and favor him or her over the employer.Due to the complexity of jury trials, having an attorney is a necessity.
Your local bar association typically has a searchable directory on its website of all attorneys licensed to practice in your area. Look for someone with experience defending employers in wrongful termination claims.
Another way to find a strong, experienced attorney is to talk to other business owners or managers in your community. If you know others who faced wrongful termination lawsuits, ask which attorneys they used and whether they were satisfied with the representation or have any other recommendations.

, Go over the plaintiff's allegations with your attorney and determine which ones you want to admit or deny as well as other defenses you want to assert.


Your attorney may wish to file a motion to dismiss or other motion depending on the contents of the complaint.
Any documents filed with the court must be served on the plaintiff (or the plaintiff's attorney). If your attorney files a motion to dismiss or other motion and requests a hearing, you may have pre-trial court dates to attend.

, A mediator can facilitate a relatively quick resolution to the lawsuit so you can carry on your business without the distraction.Mediation is required in some courts, which provide a list of court-approved mediators from which you and the plaintiff can choose.
Aside from being informal and non-confrontational, mediation has an added benefit for you in that everything that takes place in mediation, including any eventual settlement, is confidential. This keeps your company from having to deal with the negative publicity attendant to a wrongful termination lawsuit that goes to a jury trial.

, The employee's personnel file will include information about the employee's performance and disciplinary record that could be important to your defense.


If, for example, the employee received negative performance evaluations or multiple disciplinary citations, he will have a hard time claiming that he didn't receive fair warning that his job was in jeopardy.In contrast, a history of positive performance reviews weighs in the employee's favor, as she can use that to argue that she believed her continued employment was assured and was blindsided by the termination.Conduct a thorough background check and review the information provided to you when the employee was hired.
If you determine that the employee lied on his or her application or resume, or during the interview, you may have a defense. Some courts don't allow wrongful termination claims where the former employee obtained the job by lying or misrepresenting his or her background, experience, or qualifications., You should talk to anyone at your company who worked directly with the plaintiff or had a role in his or her termination.A wrongful termination suit often hinges on whether the employee was given fair warning that his or her employment was in jeopardy or subject to termination.
Any feedback given to the employee prior to his or her termination can be useful in your defense, because it can show that the employee was on notice.
At the same time, you need to know what managers or supervisors told the plaintiff regarding his or her chances for promotion or wage increases, and whether the plaintiff was misled about continuing opportunities.If the employee was repeatedly transferred or experienced frequent changes to his or her hours, this information could be used to show you were trying to make him or her quit.

, Certain statements in your employee handbooks, such as ""at-will"" employment policies, may help you defend yourself in a wrongful termination lawsuit.Check the language in your employee handbooks to make sure there are no assurances or guarantees of continued employment – or language that could be understood or interpreted as such.
Written policies or disclaimers that reiterate the at-will nature of employment help prove that the employee understood the employment relationship and that he or she was not guaranteed continued employment.

, If the employee previously filed any charges at a federal or state agency, these reports will be important to the lawsuit.Particularly if the plaintiff is claiming he or she was fired for a discriminatory reason, state and federal law require that he or she file a charge with the appropriate government agency before filing a lawsuit. If no charges were filed, you can use that information to have the lawsuit dismissed.
If the employee filed charges or reports with administrative agencies, check the dates those charges were filed and how they were resolved – particularly if the lawsuit alleges the employee was fired in retaliation.
Generally, if the employee was fired within six months after filing a charge with an administrative agency, he or she can claim the termination was retaliation. With a retaliation claim, the burden of proof shifts and you must show that you didn't fire the employee because of the charges she filed or for other legally protected activity.

, Through discovery, you and the plaintiff will exchange information and evidence in preparation for trial.Be prepared for requests for production from the plaintiff. The plaintiff will want copies of his or her personnel file, other human resources files, and any written employment policies or employee handbooks.
Even though these documents technically couldn't be used as evidence in court, they do qualify under the business records exception and generally will be admitted at trial provided they were prepared in the regular course of business.
Other potential evidence would include any written correspondence between managers, supervisors, or human resources employees regarding the plaintiff's termination. Any discussion of the reasons for the employee's termination potentially can be used as a defense in a wrongful termination lawsuit – particularly if they include non-discriminatory or retaliatory reasons.

, Your employment policies should state explicitly that your employees are not guaranteed continued employment.Your written policies should stress that employment is at-will, and not promise any level of job security beyond that. Be careful about using words such as ""permanent,"" as they can imply employees cannot be fired.
You also should take care in the language you and any other managers use when new employees are hired. Avoid promising them anything beyond at-will employment, or discussing long-term employment hypotheticals.
Make it clear in your written employee handbook and other materials that the written policies supersede any statements any managers or supervisors make to employees, and that no statements about employment carry any weight unless they are in writing.
If you've included a disciplinary section with your procedure for write-ups and eventual termination, add a disclaimer that employment is still considered ""at-will"" and employees can be terminated for other reasons or for no reason at all, regardless of the disciplinary system.Review your policies and procedures regularly to make sure they conform with existing state and federal employment law.You may want to get an attorney to assist you with this.

, Training for your employees and managers reinforces your policies and ensures that employees understand their status.Orientation should include an explanation of written policies contained in the employee handbook, a copy of which should be provided to each employee.
Start the relationship off right by educating new employees from the outset about the nature of their employment and your expectations for employees.
Train managers to keep detailed written records of performance or disciplinary problems with employees. Anytime an employee is ""written up,"" the form should be filled out completely by the manager and signed by both the manager and the employee after a discussion of the issue. Provide employees with a copy of these forms.

, Performance evaluations provide employees with ongoing feedback.Given that many wrongful termination lawsuits hinge on whether the employee had fair warning that his or her job was in jeopardy, performance evaluations keep the record straight on how the employee is doing with the company.
If you have your employees on a probationary period in their first few months of employment, consider terminating employees who aren't performing well during that probationary period rather than extending the period in the hopes that their performance will improve., Employees should understand exactly what is expected of them in the workplace as well as the consequences for not meeting those expectations.


Keeping employees in the loop in terms of what is required of them and how they are meeting or failing to meet expectations can help ensure that if someone is terminated, it doesn't seem to him or her as though it came out of nowhere.
You may want to consider having employees sign written acknowledgements of the at-will condition of their employment periodically. In the event a former employee chooses to sue for wrongful termination, these acknowledgements can protect you and your company., Analyzing a termination decision and communicating that decision to the employee effectively can minimize the possibility that the employee will conclude he or she has been wrongfully terminated.You should consider consulting an attorney to review your termination procedures and get confirmation that they are appropriately shielding you from wrongful termination lawsuits.
Make sure all managers that have hiring or firing authority understand the policies and procedures you have in place, as well as why it's important to follow them to the letter every time.
Create a termination checklist that includes a list of all forms that must be completed and information that must be passed on to the terminated employee.This will keep your managers from inadvertently skipping a form that could have protected you from a lawsuit.

Evaluate your options.",How to Defend Threats to Your Job Due to False Accusation," To accurately evaluate and respond to false accusations, you need to know as much about them as possible. Information may be limited, but you should learn as many details as possible.For example, if your employer has a written report that was submitted by your accuser, ask to see it.
Keep in mind that unless a regulatory agency is involved, you may not have the right to see it. Your employer may refuse to share it with you. If this happens, an appeal to reason might work.
Explain that you can't respond appropriately until you know exactly what you were accused of doing, and offer that identifying details may be blacked out if your accuser wants to remain unknown.
Aside from official channels, you may be able to learn more about the accusation by talking to others in your workplace.
Take care not to engage in gossip or get into arguments with people in the workplace (don't ""shoot the messenger"").;
, If the accusations center around a particular incident, such as an argument with a coworker, write down an account of the incident from your perspective as soon as possible. This can help you remember as many details as possible.Ideally, you should write everything down right after the event occurs. This may be impossible if the false accusation only surfaces months after the alleged incident took place. In that case, write down as much as you can remember.
Writing things down can jog your memory and help you unlock other details about the event that you wouldn't have remembered otherwise.
Your written account may be helpful later on if, for example, you decide to submit a written response to the accusations to your employer.

, Just as there are two sides to every story, there typically will be coworkers on the fringes of the situation who are more sympathetic to your plight. These people can become helpful witnesses and allies for you.If someone tells you that they're ""on your side,"" sit down with them as soon as possible and find out what they know about the situation.
Ideally, you should talk to coworkers outside of the workplace so your conversation will not be overheard and you can give each other undivided attention. If meeting somewhere after work isn't possible, try to arrange to have a break together.
Respect coworkers' wishes if they tell you they don't want to get involved. Some people may not want to go ""on the record,"" or get in the middle of a dispute between two coworkers. This can be true even for coworkers who privately tell you they are on your side.

, If you've been accused of violating a company rule or policy, you have the right to look at the rule itself. Understanding specific requirements also can help you identify evidence that might support your case.If your job is on the line due to an accusation that you violated a workplace rule or policy, you need to know exactly what that rule says. If your actions are within company policies, you can be assured that the accusation is false.
You may find out that your behavior actually was contrary to the stated rule or policy, but it was a rule that was never enforced. In that situation, there may be plenty of other employees who do the same thing you do.
Keep in mind that this is not an excuse. If your reading of your employer's rules shows that you made an error, let your employer know as soon as possible so you can clear up the situation.
For example, suppose a coworker has falsely accused you of taking too long for lunch – or so you thought, until you read the employee manual.
You might say ""Most people in my department take hour-long lunch breaks. I was following their lead and was unaware the actual company policy was 30-minute lunch breaks. Tell me what I can do to correct this misunderstanding.""

, Pinpoint anything that potentially supports your version of the story and make copies to show to your employer. This could include anything from emails to time cards or work reports, depending on the subject of the accusations against you.Supporting documents can be especially helpful if an employee is falsely accusing you of discrimination or harassment. Anything you have that points to fair and equal treatment of that person can help you.
For example, suppose you are a supervisor. One of the employees you supervise has falsely accused you of discriminating against her by not promoting her and instead promoting a male employee who had only been working under your supervision for a few weeks.
In that situation, you might find documents showing that you had in fact nominated her for the position, but another manager chose someone else.
You also may have an email from the accuser in which she stated she didn't want to be considered for any promotions because it would mean she had to work different hours. Any of this type of documentation would be helpful in defending yourself against the false accusation.

, When talking to anyone representing your employer – whether it's a manager or someone in human resources – your attitude can make all the difference in how you are treated.If you get angry and start lashing out, you may end up inadvertently proving the accuser correct. At the least, you'll give your employer a poor impression of your ability to handle conflict.
Try to put yourself in the shoes of the person representing your employer. They are just doing their job and trying to get to the bottom of the situation. They're not your enemy – but if you treat them like your enemy, that may be what they become.
If you find it difficult to handle the situation in person, ask if you may submit a written response. Being able to write it out enables you to approach the situation more calmly, without feeling like you're being interrogated.

, The more your employer relates to you as a person, the easier they'll find it to understand your side of the story. This doesn't mean you have to become the top office brown-noser. Just look for things you and the person with whom you're speaking have in common.If you and your employer have something in common, bring it up. Just be careful not to bring it up in such a way that it looks like you're trying to avoid answering a question or change the subject.
Some people are all business at work, and don't care for small talk or social chit-chat. If your employer isn't open to more social discussion, drop it.
However, if you are able to focus on things you and your employer have in common, it can help your defense because they will see you more as a person like them.
This can be especially helpful if the false accusation is related to harassment or behavior of a more personal nature (as opposed to violation of a workplace rule).

, You may be angry or indignant about the false accusations against you, and you may have some choice words to say about your accuser – but keep them to yourself. Bringing emotions into the situation or flinging back false accusations only muddies the waters.False accusations can be more common when you and a coworker don't get along personally. It can be easy to get fired up about somebody you find annoying or vile, but it's important to keep a cool head when your job is on the line.
Allegations and accusations are just that – statements that have not yet been proven true or false. Your employer is trying to get down to the truth of the matter.
The best way to enable your employer to discover the falsity behind the accusation against you is to point to factual evidence that establishes your innocence.

, Depending on the type of accusations, your employer or the human resources department may launch a full-scale investigation to determine what really happened. Cooperating fully and making yourself available can help your situation.Although the entire situation may be stressful, your full cooperation is the best way to ensure the situation is resolved quickly.
If you balk or refuse to participate or answer questions, the investigation will stall. Without your participation, your employer may decide to believe the accusations are true.
Your cooperation also signals to your employer that you are taking the situation – and your job – seriously. Your openness and willingness to discuss the accusations shows how much you care about maintaining a positive employment relationship.

, In some situations, especially if the false accusations are of a more personal nature, mediation can be beneficial. If you think it might help resolve your problem and protect your job, bring up the idea to your employer.In mediation, a neutral third party works with you and your accuser in a safe, private environment. The mediator facilitates discussion that hopefully will lead to a mutually acceptable resolution for all involved.
Many employers already have a mediation program in place for dealing with workplace disputes. If yours does not, you might want to suggest it to your employer.
Keep in mind that for mediation to work, you have to keep an open mind about the situation. Even though the accusations may be false, you have to be willing to work with your accuser.
This means you may have to accept some blame so that you can move forward, even if you know that you are completely innocent. While this can be a very difficult thing to do, it could potentially save your job.

, Particularly if you are classified as an at-will employee (and most employees in the United States are), you have limited rights when it comes to disciplinary sanctions at work.For example, if your employer writes you up as a result of the accusation, you're not doing yourself any favors by refusing to sign the write-up notice.
In fact, courts have held that an employee refusing to sign a write-up notice is sufficient cause to fire that employee for insubordination.
You may have legal options you can pursue to clear your name. However, if you truly want to keep your job it's generally best to accept any disciplinary measures taken.

, False accusations in the workplace can touch on a number of legal issues. Being able to identify the different types of legal claims you might have can help you find the right attorney to offer you advice.Issue-spotting is a fairly complex procedure that law students tackle extensively over three years of law school – so don't expect to become a master.
However, basic issues can be spotted more easily, and point you in the direction of the type of attorney you need to consult.
For example, if the false accusations relate to something that harms your reputation, you may have a defamation claim against your accuser.
An accuser might file a false report against you to manipulate you into doing something for them, such as giving them a raise or a promotion. That situation involves elements of blackmail or fraud.
Your accuser also may have a discriminatory motive. For example, they may have made a false accusation against you because they don't want to work with (or be supervised by) someone of your race or gender. This is an employment law issue.

, Apart from asking trusted family or friends for recommendations, you also may be able to find attorneys to consult by searching online. Your state or local bar association typically will have a searchable directory on its website.Many bar associations have an attorney-referral service that will do much of that issue-spotting work for you.
All you have to do is answer a few questions about your case, typically using an online form, to retrieve a list of attorneys who handle clients with problems similar to yours.
Do a little research on the attorneys you find. Look at their professional websites to learn more about them and read client reviews. This can help you narrow down your list to a handful of attorneys who potentially could give you the best advice.

, Most attorneys offer a free initial consultation. You can use this to your advantage to get advice from a number of different lawyers without breaking the bank. This can be especially helpful if your case involves several legal issues and you're not sure which direction to take.If you are seriously contemplating pursuing legal action, and want to hire an attorney for that purpose, you should interview at least three.
However, if you're just looking for some general advice on what to do and haven't made up your mind yet what to do, feel free to talk to as many or as few attorneys as you feel is necessary to make an informed decision.
When you schedule the consultation, ask if there's any information about your case that the attorney needs before the consultation. Some attorneys have a basic information form they expect all potential new clients to complete.
Do your best to get any information about your case to the attorneys as soon as possible – at least several days before the consultations are scheduled. This gives the attorneys plenty of time to familiarize themselves with your situation.

, Often, attorneys treat free initial consultations as little more than an opportunity to market and sell their services. However, if you come armed with plenty of specific questions, you can get the information you need.If you're planning on hiring an attorney, ask questions about their work and communication style. These consultations will be more focused on finding an attorney with whom you'll have a positive and productive working relationship.
The consultation has a different focus if you're still trying to sort out what to do. Ask specific questions about your case as well as whether the attorney believes a lawsuit would be worth pursuing.
Contrary to popular belief, most attorneys aren't sue-happy people who are itching to take any and every case that might come their way. If an attorney believes you don't have a case, they'll tell you.
Likewise, if an attorney believes you have a case, but it's not a strong one or not one that would be worth the time and expense of a lawsuit, they'll tell you that too.

, After you've finished talking to several attorneys, you have a big decision to make regarding whether you want to file a lawsuit or take other legal action against your accuser.You may decide that you want to sue your accuser, or your employer, or both. Get in touch with the attorney you felt was the best fit for you as soon as possible so you can determine your next steps.

Keep in mind that attorneys are experts. If one (or several) attorneys have told you that a lawsuit is not worth pursuing, you're probably better off dropping the issue.
Focus on your work and repairing any damage that has been done to your reputation as a result of the false accusation.

, Think in terms of the number of vendors or other organizations that may be asked to exhibit, and focus attention on hotels that offer a large enough area for this portion of the event. The space may be in the form of 1 or more conference areas that allow easy access to each of the exhibit booths.

Reward high performers as necessary.",How to Change Office Procedures," Write out a summary of the new change in procedure, comparing it with the existing procedures. You should cover several items in your summary, including:What the current policy is.
What the current practice is. If the employees have been deviating from established procedures already, you may only be changing procedures in order to comply with established practices or to create compliance with established procedure.
What the new policy is.
Concrete goals for complying with the new procedure. Think of these as benchmarks that allow people to know if they’re succeeding. For example, if you want to transition your office to “zero-based budgeting,” where the budget costs from the previous year aren’t assumed, then it makes sense to give your office benchmarks over the course of the year for how many departments need to be converted over to the new system.;
, Even if making a change is the right thing to do, it isn’t always the right time to make a change. In order to know if the time is right, you need to have an idea of the costs of making the change in procedure.Consider the monetary cost of the materials necessary for the change in procedure. In the electronic filing example, this might be the costs of the software and hardware for the new filing system, the cost of removing the physical infrastructure for the paper filing system, and any costs of refurbishing the office space as a result of either.
Factor in the costs in lost productivity from the employees having to learn a new system.
Consider the costs in lost opportunities. While your staff is busy transcribing records, they’re not out drumming up other business or attending to customers’ needs. This is also a component you must factor in when you weigh the cost of change.

, Once you’ve got a good idea of the possible costs of the new change in procedure, you can compare it to your organization’s resources.While you want to consider things like time and money, it’s important to factor in the margin for error as well. Not only should you be able to afford the new procedure in terms of money and resources now, but you need to be able to afford it if something goes wrong as well.

, Nearly any type of procedural change, no matter how small, will encounter resistance. Count on it. The best way to manage resistance is to weaken it before it has a chance to organize. Therefore, before you formally introduce a new policy, you should put together a coalition of those powerful enough to disrupt your plans and get them behind the change.If you can’t get these important stakeholders on your side, implementing change is going to be extremely difficult, even if you’re the boss. It’s probably best to wait until you’ve developed a coalition. If you implement the change on a hostile audience and it is unsuccessful, the resistance can undermine your authority. After all, these are the people who will ensure the new policy is actually carried out. They won’t do as good of a job if they disagree with what they’ve been tasked to enforce.
If the change is going to be particularly controversial, feel out possible coalition members individually. Once you’ve brought them over to your side, you can use their influence to help convince more reluctant parties.

, Inertia seems to apply to people’s behavior as much as it does to physics, and if people don’t think there’s an urgent reason to behave differently, it’s often difficult to get them to behave differently. While you may use your power as supervisor to coerce them into compliance, that approach will breed resentment, which will make it more difficult to implement change in the future.In establishing the sense of urgency, explain to the office why market pressures (like declining revenues) or opportunities make the suggested change the preferable option between two or more inevitable outcomes. For example, if you need to implement a four-day workweek, you may get some pushback, because people don’t like to work ten hour days. However, if the office is presented with the choice of a four-day workweek against the alternative of pay cuts or job losses, resistance is likely to be far less.

, Instead of just coming in one day and implementing the new policy, let your employees know a new policy is on the way. Then they'll have time to mentally prepare themselves to make the adjustment.


For example, if everyone in the office was going to have to take a new training class, instead of just putting them in the class one day, explain to them what the class is for, how long it will take, and what portion of the new credentialing requirements it represents (like a five-hour course in a ten hour certification).
People can be forgetful. It's always a good idea to issue periodic reminders as the clock winds down.

, You’re most likely implementing a new procedure because you want to be able to better serve the customers you have and find new customers down the road. If your customers won’t tolerate the temporary inefficiencies created by the change, it might be best to put it off.Not only do you need to make sure the timing is good for you and your organization, you also need to make sure it’s good timing for your customers as well. For example, if you provide logistics services to local retailers, suddenly becoming less efficient around the holidays is probably a poor strategy.

, Once the policy has been explained to everyone, distribute two copies of the summary to the workers in your office. Have them sign one and keep another for themselves. That way you have a signed commitment that acknowledges the new policy and agrees to abide by it., As you inform the entire office of the new policy, make sure that you have budgeted plenty of time to train those who will be affected by it. Training may take an hour or it may be a multiple day or week process, depending on the scope of the change. Ensure a smooth transition by making sure everyone fully understands the new policy and has time to practice, ask questions, and start getting comfortable., Especially if you’re implementing a large change in procedure, it’s important to implement it in stages. Not only does it give your office staff the opportunity to make mistakes and become accustomed to the new procedures, it also gives you the opportunity to revise goals, manage expectations, and tweak the next stages of implementation. Establish a schedule for the transition and training and share the relevant parts with everyone who has to comply with it. That way, people have a better idea of what's expected of them.

, Ultimately, the people tasked with adopting the new procedure are the ones who will ensure it is adopted successfully. If you’re interested in the success of the new procedure, then you need to make sure you’re listening to the problems the people who are implementing it are encountering. After all, unless you’re infallible, there are probably a few circumstances you didn’t foresee.Some managers think listening to employee feedback is a sign of weakness. On the contrary, it shows the manager is secure enough in their authority to adapt to changing circumstances. Whereas a manager in danger of losing their job might have a legitimate fear of being upstaged by a subordinate, one who is secure in their position can listen to and credit subordinates for their input.

, The new policy may have seemed perfect on paper, but in practice it might not work out exactly as you hoped. Take the feedback you receive (keeping in mind there will be some push back that is simply a result of being resistant or adjusting to the new procedure) and decide if the policy needs adjustments., Remember that it may take time for you to see the full effect of your policy change. Getting feedback after the first month and then never following up again means you might not see the total impact of the change, and you may miss out on opportunities to correct or perfect the policy. Make sure you are checking in regularly to ensure the policy is having the desired effect., Rewarding high performers is a classic method of overcoming resistance. It creates additional incentives to comply with the new policy and it creates counter incentives toward following the group mentality in the case of widespread resistance to change. For example, if you had to switch the record-keeping system from paper files to electronic files, you might reward anyone who coverts a certain number of files with a gift certificate to a nice restaurant, a paid day off, or a trip to the spa.

Think of your co-workers.,
Gauge your potential effectiveness.,
Consider your options.,
Prepare before a sick day arrives.",How to Call in Sick1," Even if you aren’t best buddies with everyone in your workplace, hopefully there isn’t anyone you want to see fall ill. At very least, think about the hassles it will cause you if half your office is sick and absent/unproductive, all because of you.


Stay home if you are contagious. If you’re coughing, sneezing, have a runny nose, or have an open wound, don’t go into work.Think about how you feel when you’re healthy and the guy in the next cubicle is hacking all day and sneezes on the copy machine.
Don't however, confuse cold symptoms with seasonal allergies, which are not contagious and (under normal circumstances) not usually worthy of a sick day. Both maladies involve the runny/stuffy nose and sneezing, but allergies should not bring on a fever or body aches, among other differences. Talk to your doctor if you seem to get a lasting cold at the same time(s) each year; it may be allergies.Be particularly conscientious about any colleagues that may be of higher risk for illness or infection. Co-workers who are pregnant, immune-compromised, or undergoing cancer treatments, for instance, are more likely to fall ill and face serious complications.Don’t feel guilty about giving everyone a little extra work in your absence. You are doing them a favor by keeping your germs at home.;
, If you can’t stand up, see straight, stay awake, or go ten minutes without running for the toilet, how helpful are you going to be at work anyway?


Your boss might not like you taking a sick day, but he/she also won’t be happy if you are useless the entire day. It probably serves you (and your employment) best to be productive when present and absent when unproductive.That said, if you called in sick every time you felt less than 100%, you’d hardly ever go in at all. Determine whether you can put in a legitimate, if not necessarily exceptional, day of work.

, Nowadays, many of us already do much of our work from home or can do so if necessary. Think about whether you need a work-from-home day or a no-work-at-all day.


Offer to work from home if your job duties permit it and you are contagious but not incapacitated.
However, don’t offer to work from home if you are simply too ill to work. In these instances, rest is usually essential to helping you get better.If you are hesitant to call in sick at all, or to do so without offering to work from home, because of pressure from your supervisor(s), consider ways to advocate for more sensible sick-day policies at your job. Talk to your co-workers about creating a united front regarding how paid sick days can actually improve productivity and morale., If you work as part of a “team” or are a supervisor yourself, you may be more hesitant to take a sick day when you should, out of fear that you’ll mess up everyone else’s workday as well.


If you are starting to feel lousy during a workday and suspect that tomorrow could be a sick day, create a “sick day list” of tasks for your colleagues/subordinates in your absence. Mark it clearly and place it on your desk so it can be easily found the next day if you are out.
More generally, just keeping a list of “tasks in my absence” ready, updated, and accessible is probably a good idea. You can provide direction and leadership even in your absence."

Consult your doctor regarding surgical options.",How to Fix Achilles Tendonitis1," Before you start trying to treat yourself for Achilles tendonitis, you should consult your doctor. She will make the correct diagnosis and develop an individualized treatment plan for your specific injury.


Make sure you tell your doctor about any recently increased physical activity involving your lower legs since this is likely the source of the injury. The doctor will also give you an idea of how long you should refrain from activity.
If the pain associated with your Achilles tendon is severe or if you experience a sudden disability with the flexion of your foot, then see a doctor immediately. You may actually have a torn or ruptured Achilles tendon, which is a far more serious diagnosis.More common symptoms of Achilles tendonitis that may warrant a trip to the doctor include mild-to-moderate aches in the back of the leg or above the heel, especially after a sports activity or exercise. You may additionally experience tenderness or stiffness in the area, which is most commonly felt first thing in the morning.;
, One of the first things you can do to help mend your injury is to give the tendon plenty of rest. You don’t have to stay off the foot entirely, but you should avoid running, stair climbing, and other high-impact sources of stress to the tendon.Depending on the severity of the tendonitis, you may need to rest the tendon anywhere from days to months.Listen to your body and reintroduce high-impact activities slowly.
While resting your Achilles tendon, switch to low-impact exercise options such as biking, elliptical exercises, and swimming., Applying ice to the affected area can help reduce swelling, which will also reduce pain. Place an ice pack on your calf at the site of the pain for about fifteen minutes.You can repeat this as needed throughout the day whenever pain is present.If you anticipate pain after an exercise, you can also ice the injured calf after an exercise as well.You can ice the area for up to twenty minutes, but you should always stop to let the skin warm up if you start to feel the skin go numb., You can take acetaminophen or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen to reduce pain and swelling associated with Achilles tendonitis.Always carefully follow the directions, and do not take more than directed for each drug.


Try a short course of seven to 10 days.
Even when used as directed, most over-the-counter pain relievers are not meant for daily use. Consult your doctor before taking an OTC medicine for your injury for longer than one month.If your doctor writes you a prescription for a stronger pain reliever, ensure that you always take it as directed.

, Wrap your foot and lower leg with elastic bandages or compression wraps. Compression helps reduce swelling and movement in the affected tendon., Keeping the injured tendon above the level of your heart will also help to reduce swelling. If you can find a comfortable position to do so, consider sleeping with your foot elevated as well., Smoking slows healing by decreasing blood supply and slowing tissue repair.You can help reduce your amount of down time by avoiding all tobacco products while healing your injury.

, Athletic shoes that both support your arches and cushion your heels can help reduce pain and promote healing.Additionally shoes that are softer at the back of the heel will reduce unnecessary irritation to the tendon.In some cases, your doctor or physical therapist may also advise some type of insert of orthotic. These devices go into a shoe to increase support on a specific area of the foot.Orthotic devices more commonly help insertional Achilles tendonitis (lower in the leg where the tendon inserts into the heel) because the area is more likely to be irritated by certain footwear.If your pain is severe, your doctor may also recommend a recovery boot in order to keep the foot flexed and strain off the tendon. This is usually a short-term step since prolonged use of a boot can weaken calf muscles., Cortisone is an effective anti-inflammatory medication.Cortisone injections are common for many uses in order to reduce pain and swelling. However, due to the increased risk of damage to the tendon with the injection, your doctor may not recommend this option until you’ve exhausted other possible treatments., If a combination of treatments and physical therapy options do not improve your pain for six months or longer, then your doctor may decide to discuss some surgical options.Some of these options include:Gastrocnemius recession — This surgery lengthens calf muscles in order to take additional stress off your Achilles tendon.
Debridement and repair — This operation removes the damaged portion of the Achilles tendon and is usually only for tendons with less than 50% damage.
Debridement with tendon transfer — For tendons with more than 50% damage, tendon from the big toe is transferred to the Achilles tendon when the damaged portion is moved in order to keep the tendon strong enough to function.

Observe your boss’s response to sick days.,
Assume that you need to call in.,
Don’t milk it.,
Be thoughtful when you return to work.",How to Call in Sick2," Does he blow a gasket if someone calls in sick for anything short of Ebola? Does she grouse about notices by text or email instead of a phone call? Use these observations to help you determine when and how to call in sick.Fear of upsetting the boss by calling in sick is one reason why the average American worker takes five sick days per year, even though he/she is entitled to eight or nine.In the best case scenario, you’ll find your fears eased because your boss actually responds quite reasonably to legitimate sick day requests.
In the worst case scenario, you’ll find that you’re going to have to be insistent and persistent to secure a sick day, even when you really need it.

, If you’re lucky, your boss may be fine with a sick-day text or email (see samples below in this article). Realistically, though, you’re probably going to have to go through an actual, person-to-person phone conversation.


In most instances, calling in sick attaches greater respect, seriousness, and legitimacy to your request.Deciding when to call is important as well. You don’t want to call too early — you might wake your boss up, or give the impression that you didn’t even give coming in to work a chance. However, calling too late may be deemed disrespectful for leaving everyone in the lurch by your last-minute absence.
The best time to call is usually sometime between when you normally wake up and when you leave for work. This says “I tried, but it’s obvious it’s just not happening today.”

, Yes, your boss wants to get the feeling that you’re actually sick, but no, he/she does not need the gory details of your morning spent bent over the toilet. Be clear, direct, and brief in explaining why you need to stay home.By knowing your boss and how he or she responds to sick day requests, you’ll have a better idea of how much detail you need to provide regarding your particular illness, symptoms, etc.
Unless you’re certain of your phone acting skills, faking or exacerbating symptoms for effect is probably not a good idea. You’re more likely to elicit suspicion than sympathy if your “scratchy voice” or “persistent cough” sound manufactured, even if you actually have those symptoms in a milder form.
Apologize for the inconvenience, but don’t feel guilty if you are truly sick and unable to come in. Remember, you are actually doing everyone a favor., You don’t need to give everyone explicit details about how sick you were, or play up your remaining symptoms as proof of why you stayed home the day before. (On the other hand, you probably shouldn’t act like you feel better than ever, either.) Instead, a little extra common courtesy is in order.


Be appreciative of any efforts made to pick up the slack in your absence, and apologetic for any inconveniences you caused.
Likewise, show you care about your co-workers’ health by practicing exemplary hygiene upon returning.Wash your hands like you’re a surgeon heading into the O.R., and pump that hand sanitizer bottle on your desk until it’s empty. Declare war on any remaining contagion you may have.

Pick the right time for a sick day.,
Start acting sick the day before.,
Prepare for your phone call.,
Make the call, and make it count.,
Act a little sick the next day at work.",How to Call in Sick3," If you're committed to calling in sick, you should take a look at your calendar in advance to make sure that the day you choose doesn't stand out as the perfect day to be off from work. Here are some ways to choose the right day:


Recognize that if you pick a Friday or a Monday, you will have to be extra convincing because it will seem like you're trying to carve out a nice little three-day weekend for yourself.Make sure you haven't been taking too many days off recently, whether it's been for a real illness or not. You don't want to look like the person who is always looking for a day off. Make sure you've gone to work every day for at least two months before you decide to play hooky.
Don't pick a particularly important or annoying day, like the day of a meeting everyone dreads, or the day when a client everyone knows you don't get along with will come in. This will make it obvious that you're trying to avoid being at work on that particular day.
Don't pick a day of a major sporting event in your town. If everyone knows you are a fan of a certain team and that you're dying to go to a day game, your excuse will not work.
If you're American, don't pick a Monday after Super Bowl Sunday. This is a big drinking day for many Americans, and it'll be pretty obvious that you're calling in because you're hung over, not sick.

, Once you've chosen the sick day of your dreams, you should give signs of an oncoming illness at work the day before. It will look suspicious if you were working harder than ever or cracking up in the coffee lounge one day and then calling in with a debilitating illness the next. That said, overselling your emerging fake illness can be an obvious sign to your boss and co-workers, so aim for mild indications.Cough or sniffle once in a while.
During lunch, casually mention that you don't have an appetite.
Look slightly unkempt. If you're a man, tussle your hair or don't tuck in your shirt all the way. If you're a woman, wear less makeup than usual and don't wash your hair to give yourself a ""slightly tired"" look. Don't take this too far — remember that you want to look like you're getting sick, not like a slob.
Don't be too obvious about your illness. Once people hear your cough or sniffle, they will ask how you're feeling. Try to brush it off. Just say, ""No, really, I'm fine"" or ""I'm just a little tired today, I guess.""
If you're a big coffee drinker, have tea instead.
Hold your hands to your head like you have a headache.
Casually take pain medication during your work day. Bring a full bottle of pills to work so everyone can hear the pills shaking in the bottle when you take it out. You can also just pretend to take the pills, but it has to be convincing.
Be more reserved that day. Don't go out of your way or be friendly to everyone.
If your coworkers invite you to happy hour or out for lunch, thank them but say you're just not feeling up to it.
If it's a Friday and you're planning on taking a Monday off, mention that you're not feeling well at the end of the day, but that you'll be able to sleep it off over the weekend. Then when you call on Monday, you can mention how you started feeling terrible over the weekend and that you're feeling a bit better, but not recovered.

, Once you've started “Operation Sick Day” at work, you should prepare for your phone call when you get home. You should be ready for anything that may come up during your call so you're not caught off guard.


Know your illness inside out. Is it a migraine, a cold, something else? A migraine or a cold are good excuses. Don't try to pick an illness that is so complicated that it'll be hard to describe, or something that may take several days to recover from, such as strep throat or food poisoning.
Know your illness, but don't give too many details. You want to keep the call short and sweet.If your boss asks questions about it, you can give answers.
Prepare for any questions your boss may ask so you sound like you're being honest. Know when your illness started, how you think you'll feel tomorrow, and what you'll be doing that day to recover.
Rehearse your conversation. You can even call a close friend to practice on him or her. You can try writing down what you'll say to help you rehearse, but don't just read from a paper when you're making the real call.

, This is the moment of truth for your fake sick day. Make a convincing call, and you’re (literally) home free. Do it wrong, and you’ll end up at best with an angry boss and at worst with your walking papers. Call at the right time, and in the right way, to improve your odds of success.


Make your phone call early. After you've prepared for the call, you should call your boss nice and early. Don't call so early that you wake him up and are a nuisance. Just call right around the time you would normally wake up for work so it looks like you woke up to go to work and realized you weren't feeling well enough to go.
Sound sick during the call. Whether you're leaving a voicemail or talking to your boss, it's important to sound convincing about being sick. There are a few things you can do to sound like you're really coming down with something:
Cough or sniffle occasionally during the call. Don't overdo it because fake coughs can be really obvious, but a well-placed cough or sniffle can do the trick.
Make your voice sound hoarse. You can do this by screaming into a pillow to make your throat ache a little bit, or making sure not to drink water before the call.
You can also call while lying down and having your head hang upside-down (to sound congested), but make sure this doesn't disorient you and make you forget exactly what you were going to say.

, It would be suspicious if you showed up to work looking well-rested and excited about life. Instead, you should act like you're feeling better after your cold, but still exhibiting signs of that pesky illness. Remember to practice particularly good hygiene to keep on everyone’s good side as well.Don't groom yourself as well as usual. Again, you don't have to look like a slob, but your hair, face, and clothes should look just a tiny bit disheveled.
Keep to yourself more than usual.
Blow your nose or cough once in a while.
Be apologetic about having to miss a day of work.
Don't show up with a nice tan or new outfit. This will make it obvious that you spent the day out in the sun or shopping.

Consult a physical therapist.,
Perform toe stretches.,
Perform calf-plantar fascia stretches.,
Perform calf stretch exercises.,
Perform bilateral heel drops.,
Take steps to prevent future Achilles tendonitis.",How to Fix Achilles Tendonitis2," For severe cases of Achilles tendonitis, you should consult a physical therapist in order to come up with a strengthening regimen to suit your individual injury. A physical therapist will likely have you start with easier exercises and build to ones that place a greater stretch on the tendon.


Even for mild cases where a physical therapist is not necessary, keep in mind that gentle strengthening and stretching options are always recommended when healing a tendon., To perform this exercise, sit in a chair with your heel on the floor. Reach down and pull your big toe up and back toward you.Hold the position for around fifteen seconds when you first start the exercise, but gradually increase time to thirty seconds.You can do this exercise for up to four repetitions at a time and five times a day., To perform this exercise, sit on the floor or a mat with your legs outstretched and knees straight. Loop a towel around your foot on the injured leg so that it passes just beneath your toes. Pull back on the towel with both hands to stretch your foot up toward you.Hold the position for 15-30 seconds.You can perform this exercise for up to four repetitions at a time and five times per day., This basic exercise is great for stretching calf muscles and your Achilles tendon. Plant one foot behind you with your heel flat on the ground. Lean against a wall with both hands and place your weight on your bent, forward leg. Slowly push your hips toward the wall while keeping your back foot planted. Hold the position for ten seconds. You will feel a strong pull in the calf of your back leg.You can repeat this exercise up to twenty times on each foot daily.You can find further instructions for this calf stretch exercise at: How to Stretch Your Calves


, Heel drops are eccentric exercises, which means they tighten a muscle as it elongates, making them great for stretching.To perform, stand with the front half of both feet on a stair, and then raise your heels up before lowering them down as low as you can.Since the back half of your feet will hang off the stair, you should be able to lower them further than the rest of your feet. Perform this exercise in a slow, controlled fashion for twenty repetitions.As you build strength, you can begin holding weights in order to increase strengthening as you perform this exercise.You can also perform single heel drops, which are basically the same exercise but on one leg only. Always start with bilateral heel drops, and consult your physical therapist before attempting single heel drops since they can potentially cause further damage to the tendon., You can take several steps with regard to exercise in order to prevent injuring the tendon again (or in the first place). You should:Start slowly and increase activity level gradually with regard to exercise and sports
Stretch daily
Focus on calf muscle exercises
Alternate between high- and low-impact exercises

Eat enough protein.,
Get enough sleep.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Include quality fats in your diet.,
Consume healthy carbohydrates.",How to Gain Muscle by Yoga2," Your body needs a steady supply of protein throughout the say so that you can gain muscle. To gain muscle, you should eat .75 to 1 gram of protein per pound of your body weight, and protein should be 10 to 35 percent of your total calories for the day.Make sure you are eating high quality protein such as lean meat, poultry, fish, or beans.


1 large egg = 6 grams
1 cup low-fat milk = 8 grams
1 cup plain low-fat yogurt = 12 grams
½ cup low-fat cottage cheese = 14 grams
2 tablespoons peanut butter = 8 grams
1 cup quinoa = 8 grams
3 ounces of lean ground beef = 22 grams
3 ounces skinless, baked chicken = 26 grams
3 ounces grilled salmon = 21 grams

, Adults should get 7-8 hours of sleep a night.While you are sleeping, muscle building hormones (e.g. human growth hormone) are released and your muscles are able to recover from exercise.Not getting enough sleep may keep your muscles from growing and recovering from exercise as they should. #*If you do not get enough sleep, you also may be too tired to exercise or crave more unhealthy foods., Your muscles are comprised of mostly water and need water to function properly.Men need about 13 cups of water per day, and women need about 9 cups of water per day. If you exercise, you will need to drink about 1.5 to 2.5 more cups of water per day., Fat will help fuel your muscles during exercise. Limit saturated and trans fats and consume heart healthy fats. Extra virgin olive oil, canola oil, walnuts, almonds, avocados, salmon, trout, and sardines are good choices. Fats should make about 20 to 35 percent of your daily caloric intake.It is important to monitor serving sizes when consuming fats as they have twice the number of calories as protein and carbohydrates.For example, 1 tablespoon of olive oil contains 120 calories and ~14 walnuts has 185 calories.

, Carbohydrates will help fuel your muscles. You will have difficulty completing your yoga poses if your body does not have the energy it needs. About 50% of your calories should come from carbohydrates.Whole grain bread, rice, and pasta, quinoa, legumes, and sweet potatoes are good sources of carbohydrates.

Measure your head.,
Style your hair the way you do when riding.,
Find a local tack or sporting goods store.,
Choose a helmet you like.,
Open the fitting system.,
Put the helmet on your head.,
Make sure the helmet is level.,
Check the fit.,
Buckle the chin strap.",How to Fit a Riding Helmet," Helmet sizes correspond to the circumference of your head measured at its widest point. To find your size, use a flexible measuring tape and wrap it around your head about 1 inch / 2.5 cm above your eyebrows. Make sure it stays flat to get an accurate measurement. Note the result in both inches and centimeters, and write it down to take to the store with you.Helmet sizing isn't standardized, and your size may vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. If you are researching helmets online, you can check the sizing conversion charts on the manufacturer's website to make sure you are getting the right size.
If you want to buy a helmet online, make sure you can return it if it doesn't fit. You can also try helmets on at a local tack shop to find the ones that fit well, and then look for those brands and styles online.;
, For the helmet to fit correctly, you’ll want to try it on over the same hair style you usually wear when riding. It is best to keep your hair flat under the helmet, so use low pony tails or buns rather than high ones.

, You want a store that carries helmets made specifically for horseback riding. Helmets designed for other sports activities will not protect you adequately in a horseback riding fall.


You’ll also want a store that provides helmets for different types of riding — pleasure or competitive, English and Western — as well as has a trained staff to help you find the perfect helmet.
Even if you expect to buy a helmet online, it's a good idea to try some on first to figure out your correct size and which styles fit your head best.
Research local stores by going online and reading their reviews. Check what people say about the quality and price of their helmets, as well as the knowledge of their staff. If you regularly ride at a local stable, the staff there will be able to recommend a good tack shop.

, Riding helmets come in a variety of shapes, styles and colors. Using your head measurement, choose a few in your size. You will need to try on each helmet to find the one that fits best.


Everyone’s head is shaped differently, and helmet styles are all shaped differently. Even though you are trying on helmets in your size, some of them won’t fit. You might need to go up or down a size, depending on the style. And some helmets simply won’t ever fit your head correctly. In that case, just try another style.

, Some helmets have built-in pads and/or straps that can make the helmet tighter or looser simply by turning a dial. Before you put one of these helmets on, remove the pads or turn the dial to the largest setting. You can then add pads or tighten the netting if the rest of the helmet fits well., It should fit all the way down, and cup your entire skull. The helmet should fit snugly, but not be uncomfortable. Be particularly aware of any excess pressure on ears and along your temples. It is unlikely the helmet will loosen, so if it is too tight now, it will always be too tight., The helmet should sit straight on your head, with the brim level and about 1 inch / 2.5 cm — or two fingers — above your eyebrows. If it sits higher than this, it is too small and won’t protect your head. Too low and it will block your eyes.If your helmet has a fitting mechanism, you can try and adjust it if the fit is close but not quite right. Try a different style if the adjustments don’t make the fit better.

, Before you buckle the chin strap, give your head a vigorous shake like you are saying “no.” Then grab the brim and try to pull it up and down. In both cases, if the helmet slides around, it is too big.The shape of the helmet will affect the fit. If the helmet is tight across your forehead but still rocks side to side when you shake your head, it's too round for your head. If it fits at the sides but slides front to back, it's too oval., Adjust the chin strap so that it fits snugly but comfortably under your chin against your throat. You should be able to chew or yawn easily.

Check for problems at the connection to the power source.,
Check that the outlet your treadmill is plugged into is actually electrified.,
Check the connections between your power adaptor and the equipment.,
Unplug the treadmill from its electrical source.,
Check your treadmill fuses.,
Determine whether the problem is at the display.,
Consult a professional repair person.",How to Fix a Treadmill1," The easiest problem to fix, and probably the most common, is a that your treadmill is just not plugged in. Make sure your treadmill is plugged into an electrified electrical outlet and that the prongs on the treadmill's power plug are not bent or distorted in any way.;
, Plug the treadmill into a different outlet to eliminate the first outlet as the issue. If you do not have another outlet nearby, plug another device, such as an easily movable lamp, into the treadmill's outlet to see if it works.


If you know which outlets are on separate circuits, try using an outlet that is powered by another circuit.
If you don't have any power at the outlet, reset the circuit breaker or replace the fuse and try to turn your treadmill on again.

, Some treadmill models need the power supply to be adjusted before it gets to the motor. Make sure that this adaptor is in place and plugged in properly.


Some models may need to be opened to complete this step. If this is the case, be sure to unplug your treadmill before opening any electrical boxes.

, In order to check for other problems, you will need to unplug the treadmill for safety.

, If the fuses are blown, your treadmill will not start. Luckily a blown fuse is usually a quick and easy fix. You can check your fuses with a multi-meter or take them to a local electronics store for testing.If your fuses are blown, be sure to replace them with fuses that are that have the same amperage rating.

, If your machine won't turn on, it may just be that the screen of your treadmill is not working. Make sure that all of the wires between the treadmill and the display are secure.


Also check that you are getting power to the display. You can check this by using your multi-meter at the connection points between the power coming in and the display.

, If you are unable to find the problem with the previous steps, you may need to consult a professional.


If available, contact the manufacturer for information on further diagnostics to perform and for a list of qualified repair shops in your area.

Troubleshoot running belt issues.,
Unplug your treadmill.,
Clean the surface of the treadmill belt.,
Center the treadmill belt.,
Lubricate the belt.,
Check the speed sensor.,
Replace the belt.",How to Fix a Treadmill2," Determine whether the problem is with the belt itself or a mechanical issue with the belt drivers.









Making this determination will help you make your next step. If the problem is with the belt itself, you may be able to make repairs relatively easily yourself. Motor or mechanical issues may be more difficult to fix at home.

, When making repairs on your treadmill it is very important to make sure it is unplugged so that it does not accidentally get turned on and injure you.

, Spray a towel with cleaning solution and wipe down the belt. Dirt and debris can collect on the belt, which can slow it down. Debris can also drop from the belt into the interior of the treadmill, causing operating problems.


Begin cleaning at the top of the belt and tug the belt firmly to move it downward until you have cleaned the entire surface.
Be sure to let the surface get really dry before you use the machine. A wet belt could cause you to slip and injure yourself.

, Adjust the belt so that it is centered in the machine. Belts can stretch and begin to lean to one side after frequent use. You can try repositioning the belt from the outside of the treadmill by pulling gently away from the slanted side.









If the problem is severe, a technician should look at the issue.

, If the belt on your treadmill hesitates when you step on it, you may need to lubricate it. This reduces belt friction and can lengthen the life of the belt.









Buy treadmill belt lubricant or any silicone lubricant. Spray lubricant in a thin layer between the belt and the treadmill deck. For more information on how to lubricate your treadmill's belt see: How to Lubricate the Deck of a Treadmill.

, The speed sensor helps to move the belt. If the belt is jerking or not increasing in speed, the sensor might be dirty or have become detached.


The sensor is usually in the interior of the treadmill's bulk, near the belt. Consult your owner's manual for the exact location on your machine.

, If previous steps do not eliminate the problems you are having with your treadmill belt, you may want to replace it. Order a replacement from the manufacturer if you want to do the repair yourself. Make sure it is the correct model for your treadmill.









You may want to take your treadmill to a professional repair person to replace your treadmill belt.

Eliminate the possibility of other problems.,
Check any error codes flashing on the display in the owner's manual.,
Open the treadmill according to the manufacturer's instructions with a screwdriver.,
Replace the motor.",How to Fix a Treadmill3," Failure of the motor can be one of the most expensive problems with a treadmill, so make sure to eliminate all other problems before diving into motor repairs., This should tell you what kind of problems are occurring with your treadmill motor.


The manual may also tell you whether or not the problem can be fixed by you or needs to be fixed by a professional.

, Inspect the motor's connections. For non-experts, inspecting a motor might be fruitless. If nothing strikes you as being obviously wrong, you might need to consult a professional.









Be warned, opening up your treadmill's motor is likely to void any warranties you may have on the treadmill. If your treadmill is still under warranty, if may be best to forgo any home repairs and go directly to a professional repair person.

, This step should only be undertaken if you have a lot of knowledge about motors and can easily read an electronics schematic.


Treadmill motors can be purchased at exercise equipment outlets both online and in physical stores.

Hire a lawyer.,
Review your contract.,
Write down your reasons for firing your agent.,
Schedule a meeting with your agent.,
Stay calm.,
Say that you are firing the agent.,
Follow up with a letter.,
Contact your union.,
Get referrals from other athletes.,
Search the Sports Agent Directory.,
Contact the agent.,
Perform a background check.,
Meet with the agent.,
Show the representation agreement to your lawyer.",How to Fire a Sports Agent," The agreements between athletes and sports agents are often very complicated and even abusive. A lawyer will help review your contract and determine the best way to proceed. Your attorney will make sure you are terminating your contract in an acceptable manner. Be sure to hire a lawyer that is not connected to your agent or any of his or her other clients. In addition, if you have a manager as well as an agent, make sure you can continue your relationship with your manager. Often, managers and agents have close ties. If you fire one, you may have to fire the other.


To hire a lawyer, talk with other athletes about their experiences and recommendations. If you cannot get a personal referral, visit your state bar website. The state bar will run a lawyer referral service, which usually involves answering a few questions about your legal problem. After you answer the questions, you will receive contact information for qualified attorneys in your area.;
, Your contract with your agent will set out the reasons the agreement can be terminated. This clause is usually termed the ""termination clause."" Termination clauses take many forms and each one is different. Review your termination clause to determine how the relationship can be ended. Some examples of termination clauses include:""You agree and understand that the relationship is at-will."" In this type of clause, any party can be fired at any time. No notice or reason is necessary.
""You agree that either party may terminate this agreement with 90 days notice. If the termination is for cause, either party may terminate the agreement without notice."" With this clause, you must notify your agent 90 days before you fire them, unless you are firing them ""for cause."" For cause is usually defined within the contract or is defined by law. Cause often includes abuse, fraud, or theft.

, You need to tell your agent why you are firing him or her. Accordingly, you should take some time to sit down and write out the reasons you want to end the relationship.Perhaps you think the agent has not gotten you enough money. Or your agent made a huge mistake which cost you a spot on a team. Whatever the reason, you should write it down.

, You might be tempted to fire your agent with an email because you want to avoid talking face-to-face. However, you should fire your agent in the same manner that you communicated with your agent.For example, if you and your agent communicated mostly over the phone, then you should fire your agent face-to-face or in a phone call.


Also schedule a meeting if you have had a long relationship with your agent. You shouldn’t end a long business relationship by sending an email or tweet. That would reflect poorly on you.
Call your agent and schedule a meeting. State that you want to discuss something important.

, Your agent might be surprised or even upset that you are ending the relationship. Tempers can flare, but it is important that you try to remain calm. By calming yourself, you can calm your agent. Remember the following:Try to sit comfortably, using an open-body style. Don’t cross your arms or legs, or angle your body away from your agent.
Whenever your agent speaks, make eye contact and nod to show that you are listening. Don’t interrupt.
You can summarize what your agent has said. This is important, because people want to be heard. If your agent is angry, say, “I know you are angry. But this is best for me.”
However, make sure not to say, “I know what you’re feeling” or “You’ll be happy to be rid of me.”Let your agent be angry without pretending to know what he or she is feeling.

, It is crucial that you actually say the words, “I am firing you” or “I want to end our business relationship.” Your agent needs to understand that the relationship is over and that there isn’t a chance for the agent to fix something.


Don’t just say, “I’m really unhappy” if you want to fire someone. The agent might think there is a chance to repair the relationship if all you say is you are “unhappy.”
Instead, cut to the chase. Say, “Let me get to the point. I have some bad news. I’ve decided to end our business relationship. You are no longer my agent.” Always use the past tense to signal that the decision is final., After firing your agent, you should summarize the conversation in a letter so that you have adequate documentary proof of what you discussed. You don’t have to produce a transcript of the conversation, but you should hit the major points.


You can start the letter by writing, “I’m writing this letter as a follow-up to our conversation on Saturday, when I ended our business relationship.”
You should also address any ongoing work that the agent has been performing for you. For example, the agent might have been trying to negotiate an endorsement deal. You will need access to all notes and paperwork related to the negotiations.
In your letter, you should request that the agent hand over a copy of your file, so that you can get your new agent up to speed.

, If you believe your contract was abusive or your agent violated a fiduciary duty owed to you, stole money from you, or engaged in any other reprehensible activity, contact your union if you are part of one. As part of your union membership, you will receive help from your union when something happens. In the case of a bad agent, you may be able to prevent that agent from representing anyone else in the union. In addition, you may be able to file a union complaint.

, Ask fellow athletes if they would recommend their agent.You can also ask other sports professionals, such as trainers or coaches.


Write down the agents’ names so that you can perform background research on them.

, The website www.sports-agent-directory.com hosts a comprehensive listing of sports agents.You can search for agents and get their direct contact information, including email or a website address (if available).


This directory has only agents certified with the major sports leagues in the United States (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and the PGA).
You have to pay to join. However, the cost is less than $100.

, You should call or send a quick email. Tell the agent how you got his name. For example, another athlete might have told you. Explain that you are looking to hire a new agent and ask the agent if he has time to meet with you.


Not every agent will be willing to represent you. Some agents might only represent super-stars.
However, even if an agent isn’t interested in representing you, he could send you the name of an agent who might.

, You don’t want to hire an agent blindly. If an agent is interested in representing you, then you should prepare to do a basic background check. You should request the following:References. The agent should be able to give you the names of current clients you could talk to. Once you have the names, you should call and talk to the referrals.
A list of successful contracts. The agent should be willing to give you a list of contracts he has negotiated and a general sense of the terms of the contracts (duration, salary, bonuses).

, You want to check that the agent is a good fit. After performing a basic background check, you should call up agents and ask if you could meet. This will basically be an interview, though you don’t have to use the word.


If you had a particular problem with the agent, make sure to mention it when you interview the agent. For example, your old agent might not have ever returned your emails or phone calls. Be sure to ask any agent you interview how he handles client contact.
Pay attention to how honest the agent sounds. You need an agent you can trust, and honesty is a big part of trust. You should avoid agents who never say anything negative about you. Instead, look for agents who offer a realistic assessment of your potential., Before signing with the agent, make sure that your lawyer looks over the representation agreement thoroughly. You don’t want to sign an unfavorable agreement. Drop the representation agreement off with your lawyer.


A standard representation agreement should cover fees, payment schedule, the duration of the representation, and the scope of representation. It should also explain how you and your agent will settle disputes, such as by meeting with a third party mediator.Don’t be rushed into signing, either. Tell the agent that your lawyer is looking at the representation agreement and you will be in touch shortly. An agent who wants to rush you might have a questionable contract.

The less it's been used, the better, as this means there will be less wear and tear on the machine., Since you'll be running on the treadmill for exercise, it only makes sense to give it a test run before you buy it.

This won't give you an adequate experience. Give it at least 5 to 10 minutes to see how to it feels., Look the treadmill over from top to bottom and front to back. Pay close attention to anything that looks broken, cracked, or worn out. This could be evidence that the treadmill was dropped or mishandled, which could harm its internal performance.

It is difficult for non-lawyers to find court opinions, but a lawyer can find that information quite easily.
A lawyer will be helpful in other ways. For example, the lawyer can look over your draft policy and offer suggestions.
You can get a referral by contacting your state or local bar association. Once you have a referral, call the lawyer and schedule a consultation.;
, Before you can begin testing for drugs, you need to identify which drugs you will test for. Any athletic organization you belong to might specify which drugs you have to test for.


If you are designing a collegiate-level drug testing policy, then you need to adhere to your collegiate association’s requirements. The NCAA, for example, has a list of banned substances you must test for. Your athletic director can get this information from the NCAA.If you are a high school, then your athletic conference might have a list of banned substances. Contact your conference.
If your athletic conference does not require that you test for certain drugs, then you will need to come up with a list on your own. It is common to test for marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, PCP, and opioids like heroin and prescription pain relievers. You could also test for alcohol and steroids., Before drafting your drug testing policy, you need to decide which student athletes you will test. Typically, you can test the following:An entire athletic team. This is the most comprehensive testing, although it can be the most expensive, depending on the size of the team. You can test at the very beginning of the season, as a precautionary measure to catch anyone who is doing drugs.
Random sampling of a limited number of athletes. This type of sampling can act as a deterrent for the entire team. Because any athlete could potentially be tested, there is an incentive not to use drugs in the first place.
Any athlete you reasonably suspect has done drugs. If a student is arrested for drug possession, then you would have reasonable suspicion to ask the student to take a drug test.
All of the above or any combination.

, You also need to decide how often you will test. You need to consider the costs of extensive testing versus the deterrent effect of the tests. Teams usually test in the following manner:


Periodically. Periodic, unannounced testing is a good way to deter drug use. You may select five male athletes and five female athletes during each random testing period.At the start of the season. You might want to test the entire team before the start of the season, in order to weed out people with drug or alcohol addictions.
Before letting an athlete back on the team. If someone has been suspended for drug use, then you might require a test before you welcome them back.
At regular intervals, if the student has had at least one positive drug test. As a condition for letting someone back on the team, you could test them regularly.

, You also need to decide what will happen to the student if he or she tests positive. You will need to include this information in your written drug testing policy, so you might as well decide beforehand what consequences the student will face. Remember, the purpose of drug testing isn’t merely to “punish” students for doing drugs. Instead, you want to get them the help they need.


You can have a “multi-strike” policy. For example, after the first violation, you can suspend the student-athlete for a portion of the season (e.g. 20%) and recommend that he or she meet with a drug counselor.
After the second violation, you could suspend the student from a larger portion of the season (e.g., 50%). You could also require the student to undergo weekly or random drug testing for the rest of the season.
After the third violation, you could permanently bar the student from participating for the remainder of the season.Alternately, you could also simply have a “one-strike” policy and end the student’s participation in athletics for the remainder of the season.

, You need to designate someone to collect the urine sample and keep it safe until it is taken to the tester. Typically, you should have a man and a woman serve as monitors.You also need to establish a chain of custody. Come up with a protocol for labelling the test sample. For example, the monitor who collects it can write the student identification number on the specimen container. Then the monitor can give the sample to the other monitor. The second monitor will write the student identification number in a log. You can store the urine samples in a refrigerator in a locked room until testing.
If you are delivering a sample to a lab, then come up with procedures for delivering it to the lab. For example, you might have a monitor take samples to the lab and have the lab sign a document that they received the sample from you. In this way, you create a chain of custody.

, You won’t be able to implement a drug testing program for free. Accordingly, you will need to discuss who will perform the testing and also budget for that purpose. On average, a student drug test can cost $10-30 per specimen.For example, you could purchase FDA-approved drug testing kits and perform on-site testing. If you get a positive result using an on-site kit, then you should send the sample to a lab to confirm the positive result.
Alternately, you could send all samples to the lab to be tested. This would be the more expensive option.
At the lab, a Medical Review Officer will review the results and contact the school administrator to confirm a positive result.

, You should begin your written drug testing policy by explaining why it has been adopted. Your reasons may differ. However, it is a good idea to emphasize at the beginning of the document that you are testing students in order to protect their health and safety. You should also mention that the testing is meant to identify drug users so that you can get them help.


For example, you could state, “The Board of Education is dedicated to ensuring the health and safety of students. The Board recognizes the district’s role in protecting students from the dangers of illegal drug use and abuse. To support our substance abuse prevention efforts, the Board establishes a mandatory and random drug testing program for students participating in athletics. The testing program should provide a deterrent from drug use. It will also help identify current drug users and refer them to appropriate counseling and rehabilitative services.”, You should explain to the students how you will decide who to test. A description of your sampling procedure is particularly important if you are testing people at random. For example, you will want to explain that the selection will be done anonymously.


Sample language might read: “At intervals chosen by the administration throughout the school year, five male and five female athletes will be selected on a random basis. To ensure anonymity, each student will be given an identification number at the beginning of the school year. A computer program will then select five male and five female student identification numbers at random. Only the student and athletic director will know the identity behind the number.”, You need to give the student some idea of what will happen if he or she is selected to give a sample. Tell them how much time they have to give the sample. Also explain who will collect it.


You might state, “On the day the numbers are drawn, those students selected will be notified. They must promptly report to the designated place to produce a urine sample. They will be given a sample collector and provided a private bathroom stall where they can produce the urine sample. An adult monitor of the same gender will collect the sample once the student is finished.”, You should also tell students how you will handle test results. You want students to know that you are properly protecting their confidentiality. For example, you might destroy records at the end of the school year. You might also tell students that you won’t report them to law enforcement if they fail.


You might write, “The administrator of the test will be authorized to report results only to the school administration. Test results will be destroyed after one calendar year after the last day of the activity season, except with respect to students who have tested positive.”“The district shall not release test results to law enforcement authorities.”, You need to let athletes know what will happen if they fail the drug test. Explain in detail your policy, including expectations of receiving drug counseling.


Use bolded letters and underlining to bring home the consequences of failing a drug test. You don’t want students to claim that they had no idea about the consequences.

, Athletes may try to avoid taking the drug test. You should treat the refusal as a failure. Accordingly, you should explain to the student that any refusal to give a urine sample will count as a “positive” drug test.


One school uses the following language: “Failure of the student-athlete to cooperate with the testing policy shall be the equivalent of a ‘positive’ test result. That is to say, failure to appear for the testing process, failure to produce a test sample, or attempting to alter or destroy the test sample shall be treated as a ‘positive’ test result.”, You should make sure that student athletes receive the drug testing policy in written form as soon as they express an interest in participating in sports. Make multiple copies and write down the names of students you give it to.

, You should get signed consent forms from students. Make sure that they read the entire drug testing policy and ask each student if he or she has any questions. After their questions are answered, they can sign the consent form.


If signing the consent form is a condition for participating in sports, let the students know.
If you are testing high school students, then you should have parents or guardians sign the consent form as well.Sample language on the consent form could read: “We recognize that the school district is committed to protecting its students from substance abuse. For this reason, we hereby agree to accept and abide by the standards, policies, and regulations set forth in this drug testing policy. We authorize the school district to conduct random drug testing of our child’s urine specimens for drugs and/or alcohol use.”

, Some students might fail the drug test. Accordingly, you need to help the student deal with his or her drug abuse. You should begin gathering the names of substance abuse counselors you can use as referrals.


Pull your school’s guidance counselor in on discussions. They should gather names of substance abuse counselors in the community. Your counselors can perform an initial assessment but then refer the student to someone outside the school.

Ask your buddy to check your form during yoga or Pilates classes.,
Keep cost in mind.,
Don't be intimidated by your partner.",How to Find a Virtual Workout Partner," If you have an Xbox, Wii, or other gaming system that connects to the internet, you can use this to locate a partner. Certain games or applications allow you to connect with workout partners via your gaming system. These games also grant you the convenience of working out from home.Try a game like Wii Sports or Kinect Sports.
Games are usually between $20 and $30, so using a gaming system to find a workout buddy is not too costly.;
, WellSquad is a phone application that allows you to seek out virtual partners. You can use the app to find workout buddies for free, although services like professional fitness trainers come with a fee.You can download WellSquad on your phone. You can message workout buddies you meet through the app for free. There is no limit to in-app messaging.
You will get one free phone consultation with a trainer, although subsequent professional training costs money.

, There are many websites dedicated to helping with weight loss. If you're posting frequently on a weight loss forum, you may eventually find a workout partner. Try writing a post for a forum in which you express interest in finding a virtual workout buddy.In addition to finding a workout buddy, you can use these forums to keep yourself on track. Try posting your slip ups and successes every day. This can help you stay motivated to succeed in your weight loss goals.

, Workout Buddies is another phone app you can use to find online workout buddies. You can browse the profiles of a variety of users and find a workout buddy who meets your needs.The app is free to download and you can use it to message potential workout buddies.
The app can also be used by gyms and trainers. If you ever want to get in touch with someone at a local gym, you can use the app for that as well. An online partner may not work for everyone.

, You want a partner who will motivate you to success. Therefore, a slightly more advanced partner is a good idea. When looking for a workout partner, ask people about their personal fitness level. Strive to find a partner who surpasses you in some ways.Do not strive for someone who is well ahead of you. This can be too intimidating and the two of you may not be a good match. You may not be able to keep up with someone whose fitness level greatly surpasses yours.
Strive instead for someone slightly ahead of you. If you're a runner, for example, look for a running partner who can run about 15 to 20% farther or better than you.

, If you have multiple workout routines, a single partner may not work for you. Look for different workout partners for different activities. You can, for example, have one virtual partner for jogging, another for cycling, and another for weight lifting. Multiple partners can keep you motivated throughout a variety of fitness platforms.Remember to strive for partners slightly ahead of you.
If you're lucky, you may be able to find one person who works out in a variety of fitness platforms as well.

, People get different things out of a workout. You want to find someone who has roughly the same needs as you. If you're just working out to manage stress, you're unlikely to pair well with a partner going for extreme weight loss. If you're training for a marathon, a partner who works out for fun may not be a good match.When messaging people in apps or posting in forums, make your workout goals clear. State the reasons you're working and what you hope to achieve.
Ask questions when messaging a potential partner. Ask something like, ""What do you hope to gain from working out? What are your specific goals?""

, If you and your partner are not on the same schedule, you will not be able to workout together. When messaging partners, get a sense of when potential virtual buddies workout. This can help you figure out if their schedule works with yours.Take work schedules into account, as well as whether you workout before or after work.
You should also keep time zone in mind. If you're in a different time zone than your workout partner, the two of you may struggle to make your workouts sync.

, It's important to have someone spot you in the gym if you're lifting weights. In addition to an online partner, make sure you have someone nearby to spot you if you're doing weight lifting.At some gyms, there may be workers present to spot someone during weight lifting.

, Form is important to avoid strain during such activities. Although these classes have instructors there to check your form, your buddy may be able to help you out after a few classes as well.Also, if you want to practice one of the moves you learned in class outside of the classroom, then your buddy may be able to help.

, For the most part, an online buddy system will be free. However, make sure to check cost of apps. Some apps may come with a monthly fee, while others may charge for particular services. An online trainer, for example, will usually have a monthly fee., As it's best to choose a partner whose skills surpass yours, it's easy to find yourself intimidated by an online partner. However, intimidation can hurt your motivation. Keep in mind that everyone works at their own goals and, with some dedication, you can catch up to your partner.Remind yourself you chose your fitness partner to improve your overall fitness goals. This can help you see intimidation in a more positive light.

If you want to end the athletic official contract, then you could start by asking the other side if they agree to terminate your agreement.


You should write a letter and ask.Give your reasons for wanting to end the contract early.
Send your letter certified mail, return receipt requested so that you will know that it was received. Don’t be surprised if the other side does not agree to let you out of the contract. In that situation, you will need to find a reason to end the contract on your own.;
, Find the contract. The contract serves as the formal agreement between you and the other party. Go through your filing cabinets and papers and find the contract.


Call the other side and ask for a copy of the contract if you can’t find yours.
Look for the expiration date. If the contract is about to expire, then you might want to wait. After the contract expires, you can choose not to renew it.

, Your contract should contain information about how the contract can be terminated. For example, if either side doesn’t fulfill its obligations, then the contract can usually be ended. Look for a termination provision.


A sample termination provision in an athletic official contract might state: “If either party hereto fails to fulfill the obligation of any part of the contract, that party shall pay to the other party a sum equal to the contracted gross fee less mileage allowances as damages, the remainder of the contract shall not be binding, and the breach of contract shall be reported to the Association.”, You can end the contract on your own if the other party “breached” it, which means the other side did not fulfill its obligations. You should find the other party’s obligations by reading the contract.In the standard athletic official contract, officials agree to be at the assigned game and to officiate. If the official does not show up to officiate, then he or she has breached the contract.
In return, the school or sports league agrees to pay a fee for the official’s work. If the school has refused to pay, then it also has breached the contract.

, This evidence will be important if you go to court later on. You need to be able to show a judge that you didn’t end the contract because you didn’t want to pay the official money or because you didn’t want to officiate anymore. Instead, you need to show that the other side didn’t live up to its end of the bargain. As you gather evidence of the breach, look for the following:


Letters or emails sent to the official if he or she didn’t show up to officiate. You want a paper trail. You can also get witness names and statements to the effect that the official never showed up.
Any letters or emails sent to the school asking why you haven’t been paid.
Any written admission that one side will refuse to perform its obligations. For example, an official might email you stating that they quit. This type of admission is a breach of the contract., You will benefit from meeting with a lawyer to discuss your options. A qualified attorney can listen to your case and explain what will likely happen if you move to end the contract on your own.


To find an attorney, you should call your local or state bar association. They often provide referrals to attorneys.After you get a referral, you can call the lawyer and schedule a half hour consultation. Ask how much the consultation costs. Some lawyers will offer them for free while others will charge a small fee.
At the consultation, be sure to talk about whether the other side’s breach is serious enough to end the contract. A breach must be “material” for you to terminate the agreement. For example, if an official showed up to a game five minutes late, you might not have grounds to end the contract because the breach was not serious.
Think about hiring the lawyer to represent you. Ask how much he or she charges. If your case goes to trial, then you will want a lawyer’s help.

, If you can’t get out of the contract by mutual agreement, you will need to send the other side notice of its breach. The purpose of the letter is to put the other side on notice that it has breached the contract. Either you or your lawyer can draft it.


Set up the letter like a standard business letter. Use your letterhead if you have it.
Set the font to a comfortable style and size. You want the letter to be readable.
Include the date at the top of the letter. The date is critical. You want to be able to show a judge that the other side had notice of its breach and when it received notice., Mention specifically what the other side agreed to do and how it failed to fulfill its obligations. Quote the relevant contract provisions.You also might think about including a copy of the athletic official contract with your breach of contract notice.

, In your breach of contract notice, you should tell the other side how it can “cure” the breach. For example, you might want to give the school or athletic association a set amount of time to give you payment that you are owed.


The contract might state that any breach results in the contract being terminated.However, you could propose that you continue on with the contract if the other side resolves the dispute to your satisfaction.
The contract also might state how much time the other side has to cure. Typically, you are given 30 days.If there is a time stated in the contract, then remind the other side.
You also might want to simply end the contract without letting the other side cure. For example, if an official has missed three straight games, you might want to simply end the contract. In your breach of contract notice, you should state, “We are ending our contract with you immediately.”

, Generally, you can send the notice certified mail, return receipt requested. However, your contract might state the delivery method for notifying the other party of a breach.


Make sure you follow the method agreed to in the contract. The other side could claim that it didn’t receive proper notice if you send it a different way., The other side might contact you after it receives your breach of contract notice. He or she may propose negotiating a resolution to your disagreement. If there is a lot of money at stake, then you should give serious thought to negotiating.


There are several benefits to negotiating a disagreement instead of going to court. For example, negotiation is often faster and less expensive than a lawsuit.You can also preserve the business relationship. For example, you might want to do business with the school or official in the future. By avoiding a trial, you can avoid burning your bridges.

, You don’t want to walk into negotiations blind. Instead, you should think about what you want out of negotiations. You will need to analyze the strength of your case and how much you are willing to accept to settle. These factors will influence your approach to negotiations.


Identify your best alternative to negotiation. For example, your best alternative might be to end the contract and wait to be sued. If you have a strong case, then you can probably win the lawsuit. Because you have a solid best alternative, you can be more aggressive in your negotiations.Decide on the minimum you will accept. Your baseline for negotiations is your “walkaway” point.This is the minimum you will accept, otherwise you leave negotiations. If your best alternative to negotiation is attractive, then your baseline can be higher. For example, if the sports team has not paid you for three games, you might insist on ending the contract and getting all money owed to you.

, Negotiations will probably take place at a lawyer’s office. If neither party has a lawyer, then you could meet in a public library. Your lawyer (if you have one) should do most of the talking. However, you should share your input. Ethically, your lawyer can’t accept a settlement offer without your permission.


Always stay calm and listen to what the other side has to say during negotiations. By showing that you are listening, you help build trust with the other side. They will realize that you are negotiating in good faith.
Also avoid settling too fast.The other side expects you to negotiate. You could get a better deal if you continue negotiating instead of folding early.

, With mediation, you and the other side meet with the mediator, who is a neutral third party. Mediation is a good option if you do not have a lawyer since the mediator can help guide discussion.


The mediator is not a judge and does not pick a “winner.”Instead, he or she tries to get all sides to come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial. The mediator will help you listen to each other and find areas of agreement.
Mediation isn’t free. Mediators typically cost $200-800 an hour. However, mediation is usually cheaper than going to trial.
To find a mediator, you can call your local courthouse, which may run a mediation program or maintain a list of mediators. You should also call your local or state bar association, which might be able to provide a referral.

, If you reach an agreement, then you need to draft a settlement agreement which will replace your current contract. Both sides should sign it. Your lawyer or the mediator can help you draft it.


You should draft and sign a “mutual rescission agreement” if you both agree to end the contract. This agreement formally terminates the contract.Also draft a “waiver and release.” This waiver will serve as an agreement not to bring a lawsuit for your contract dispute.

, Your mediation or negotiations might not have been successful. If not, then the other side faces a choice: let you end the contract or sue you. If the other side decides to sue, then you will receive a copy of the complaint for breach of contract. The complaint will describe the dispute and state what the other side wants from the judge (usually money).Hire a lawyer if you are sued for a considerable amount of money. It can be very difficult to learn trial procedures on your own. A qualified attorney would be invaluable.
However, you might be sued in small claims court, since very little money might be at stake. In this situation, you could represent yourself. Small claims court is designed so that participants do not need lawyers. Talk with your school principal or school board to check if you still want to go ahead with using a lawyer.

Spend a little more money and time on your essentials.,
Color is key.,
Accessorize sparingly.,
Remember that looks aren't everything.",How to Have Classic Style," If you don't look good in a pencil skirt and pumps, then don't wear them.;
, Both in make-up and in clothing, a little bright color goes a long way, and if you use too much it will look over-done and garish.

, Having one great black dress is much better than having a lot of cheesy, over-colored trendy dresses.

, Essentials are a good LBD (little black dress), some quality jeans, both in black and blue wash, a pair of reasonably comfortable and fashionable black (and neutral, if you like them) pumps, a quality tailored coat in black, white, or grey, a good string of pearls, and a sturdy handbag in a quiet and classy shade (think something you could use for work as well as other occasions).

, Deep, jewel-toned colors such forest green, scarlet, and royal blue are absolutely perfect for a classic style. Bright or neon colors are trendy and fun, but you should not waste a lot of money on accessories in these shades.

, Use just one major accessory, rather than three or four. Using too many accessories or patterns will make you look over-dressed and garish. Buy a few good quality pieces of gold or silver jewellery to go with everything.

, In order to be classic with your style, you must be polite and respectable. Acting properly will get you a long way in life.

Emphasize intensity over length of time.,
Ditch stretches as part of your warm up.,
Try high-intensity circuit training.,
Try the stairs.,
Take advantage of resources at work.,
Don't overdo it.",How to Exercise During Your Lunch Break1," A shorter workout can be just as effective as a longer one if you amp up the intensity. Generally, this means using greater resistance or completing repetitions more quickly.The easiest way to build an effective lunchtime workout is to take a routine you normally do and tighten it up.
For example, if you have a strength-training routine that normally takes 40 minutes to complete, increase resistance and decrease the number of reps you do of each exercise so the same routine only takes 15 or 20 minutes.
Make sure you're doing exercises with which you're familiar. Your lunch break is not the time to learn new moves, and doing an exercise incorrectly can result in injury.
Focus on exercises that work more than one muscle group over exercises that isolate particular muscles. This will enable you to get a whole-body workout in less time.;
, You may be accustomed to stretching for five or ten minutes, but if your entire workout is only 15 or 20 minutes this is typically a waste of time. While you do need a brief warm-up, you typically don't need to do any elaborate stretching.You do, however, want to make sure you're warming up the muscles you'll be exercising adequately.
Taking five minutes or so at the beginning of your routine to jog in place or do some crunches or side bends can be an effective warm up.
You can shave minutes off your routine by multi-tasking as well. For example, if your office is several stories up, taking the stairs can provide a warm-up — especially if you're going to do cardio or work on strength-training your legs.

, Circuit training is a series of exercises that are performed rapidly, then repeated. For example, jumping jacks one minute, push-ups one minute, squats or lunges one minute, sit ups one minute. After a brief rest, then you repeat the entire series once or twice. It is the repetition of the exercise sequence which gives it the name, ""circuit.""Intervals vary from 20 seconds to usually two minutes or less.
A circuit does not necessarily have a cardio or resistance element — although it is a good idea to include these things. You might try brief burst of intense resistance training, followed by a brief burst of cardio, followed by another interval of resistance training focused on a different muscle group.
Circuits can be modified to work different muscles — just make sure you are not working the same group of muscles back-to-back. For instance, don't follow push-ups with another exercise that focuses on upper body — do lower body exercise, like squats, instead. This gives your arms a chance to rest briefly.
If you've never attempted circuit training before, you may want to watch videos or sit in on an exercise class first so you can get an idea of how the method works and how to pace yourself.

, People often feel self-conscious exercising in front of others, at least at first. The stairwell is a great place for lunchtime exercises. It is usually cooler, more private and lends itself naturally to exercising. You can walk, jog, or even sprint the stairs as well as incorporating some bodyweight exercises to strength train.

Use caution while exercising on the stairs, as falling on or down stairs can cause serious injury. Think about your fitness level and decide whether or not you can safely complete these exercises.

, Some office complexes have gyms in the building. Other employers provide discounted memberships to employees at a local gym. If you have these options available to you, they can save you significant time and money.If you're not sure about what resources are available, ask your boss or coworkers. They can give you more information on what's available and how to sign up.
It's also a good idea to let your immediate supervisor know that you plan to start a lunch break exercise program – especially if you typically eat in your office and your supervisor and coworkers are accustomed to you being around and available at lunch.
You might be able to find a coworker who's interested in doing the same thing and wants to tag along with you. As long as you aren't distracted by working out with someone else, their presence can be motivating.

, While a shorter workout does need to be more intense if you expect to get results, the point of a lunch-break workout is not to utterly wear you out so that you're hobbling around for the rest of the day.You may want to try your routine one day over the weekend so you can judge how you're going to handle it and whether it will be too much.
Keep in mind you don't necessarily want to do anything that will have you sweating profusely either, since you're going to have to go back to work immediately.
How much you sweat depends on your particular body chemistry – as well as where you workout and what you do. This is something to keep in mind when you're deciding whether your workout will be too much for a lunch break.
For example, if you plan to fit in a quick jog at a nearby park during your lunch break, pay attention to the weather. While this may be perfect when the weather is cooler, it might be too much during summer months when it gets hot.

Choose several different flavors of gel.,
Look for products with maltodextrin/fructose blends and brown rice syrup blends.,
Test out chews in addition to gels.,

Try fruit flavors, chocolate flavors and vanilla flavors.,
Try a “rocket fuel” energy gel in the last 20 minutes of the race.,
Choose the gel that gives you a noticeable pick-me-up about three to 15 minutes later.,
Eat a healthy breakfast before race day.,
Wait 45 to 60 minutes before taking your first gel.,
Time a serving so that you take it just before a water station.,
Take another serving every 30 to 60 minutes of the remaining race.,
Adjust your serving size if you have a sensitive stomach.,
Take another serving a few minutes after the end of the race if you have hit a wall.",How to Eat Energy Gel," Stomachs can often turn queasy during a race, so you are unlikely to stomach one that you don’t like when you aren’t racing.;
, Although you might like the idea of a natural product better, the synthetic product may provide better results.

, Gels are generally easier for the body to digest, since the chews require more work from the mouth and digestive system. However, some runners, bikers, hikers and other athletes might enjoy the taste of chews better.

,, You should always take energy gel with a gulp or two of water.

, You may not know what your body will crave until you are in the midst of exercise., Don’t take this type any earlier or you may run out of steam before the finish line. These types of gels don’t work for everyone., Many runners describe this as a “second wind” and the results should be noticeable.

, Although most gels will say to eat a serving 30 minutes before the race, it is far better to fill your body with less simple sugars so that you build a solid store of both complex and simple carbohydrates. Gels are simple carbohydrates, and are designed to keep you going, not start you off.

, Your store of carbohydrates will last between 90 and 120 minutes, depending upon your pace. Spend some time getting comfortable in your pace, and then pull out your gel packs.

, You will need a couple of gulps of water to swallow and digest the goo. Don’t take energy gels without water, and never take them with sports drinks.

, Read the gel packet before you race to see the serving size. It is better to take more gel near the beginning of the race than the end, because digestion may stop completely near the end.


If you know your digestion stops completely and you have trouble even consuming water near the end of a race, then don’t take energy gels near the end. You can end up throwing up the gel, because your stomach isn’t capable of digestion.

, Runners who are prone to sickness should take a quarter serving every 20 minutes throughout the beginning of the race. Choose your flavors carefully and avoid using it near the race’s end., They can help you start to recover. Begin eating more complex carbohydrates at your next meal.

Do cardio in minute-long bursts.,
Try standing while working.,
Use desk pushups and one-legged squats to build strength.,
Walk or take the stairs.,
Complete basic stretching exercises if you're stuck behind the desk.",How to Exercise During Your Lunch Break2," If you've got the space and won't disturb your coworkers, you can do jumping jacks or march in place for 60 seconds to get your heart rate up and break up your work-day with a little activity.If you work in a cubicle, it may not be possible to do this without drawing undue attention to yourself. But you should be able to go out into a hall or use a conference room.
This is a way to get some exercise throughout your workday, not just at lunch – although you can easily do this at lunch as well.
For example, if you brought a microwaveable meal for lunch, you might do jumping jacks while your food is cooking.

, If your office is set up to do so, consider doing your work while standing rather than sitting at your desk. Even if your desk isn't high enough to type while standing, you can still stand while talking on the phone or reading paper documents.You also might consider alternative seating, such as an exercise ball chair, which engages your core while you're sitting.
Staying active throughout the day keeps your heart rate up and your muscles engaged. You may not notice a significant difference in terms of specific muscle tone or dramatic weight loss, but you probably will feel healthier and more energetic.

, Even if you don't have time to go to the gym, you can still do strength-training exercises right at your desk. these basic exercises will give you a decent workout without causing you to be out of breath or work up a sweat. To do desk pushups, stand behind your desk. Then lean over and put your palms flat on your desk. Walk backwards until you are at an angle, then do pushups to build strength in your chest, shoulders, arms, back, and core.
You can do one-legged squats behind your desk, or while waiting for copies or talking on the phone.
Another exercise you can do to build strength in your lower body are modified leg lifts, which you can do while seated at your desk.
Lift one leg off the seat and extend it straight out in front of you. Hold it out straight for a couple of breaths, then lower it, but stop just short of the seat of your chair. Repeat this 10 to 15 times with each leg.

, Avoiding the elevator and delivering messages in person is a classic way to fit a little exercise into your otherwise busy day. If you drive to work, you might also get a little more exercise by parking further away from the door of the building.If you need to send a message to a coworker, it's often easiest to simply pick up the phone or send them an email; however, walking over to their office or cubicle and conveying the news in person means you get a little exercise. It may even save you time, since the two of you can talk together and find a solution to the issue without a potentially lengthy back-and-forth over email.
Even if you don't want to go to a gym for a full lunchtime workout, you can still get in a quick 10 or 15 minutes of exercise by walking up and down the stairs.
You can also take a quick jog or brisk walk around the office building to get in a little cardio on your lunch break — and you don't even have to worry about changing out of your work clothes.

, There are a number of stretches that you can and should do if you spend the vast majority of your time at work sitting behind a desk.Sit up straight in your chair and reach both arms straight over your head as far as you can. Hold the stretch for about 10 seconds, then alternate reaching each arm higher.
Turn your head to the left and your torso to the right while seated. This is an augmented yoga pose. Breathe into the stretch, then do it in the other direction.
Sitting up straight and rolling your shoulders back as though you are trying to touch your shoulder blades together is a good stretch for your shoulders and chest.
Stand and stretch your legs as though you were about to go for a run. For example, you can kick one foot behind you, grab your foot with your hand, and pull your foot towards your buttocks. Do this with each leg to stretch your quads.

Prepare your lunch in advance.,
Have a snack before your workout.,
Choose a light lunch that's low in fat.,
Pack a post-workout boost.",How to Exercise During Your Lunch Break3," One of the easiest ways to save time so you can fit an exercise and a meal into your lunch break is to pack your lunch at home the night before. Include food for lunch plus a few healthy snacks.Stay away from prepared meals that you'll need to heat up in the microwave. Waiting for your lunch to cook will eat up precious minutes.
Additionally, you may have difficulty digesting prepared meals after an intense workout session.
Rather, prepare simple foods that are ready-to-eat, such as a salad, a sandwich, or whole fruits and vegetables.

, Pack a protein or energy bar or shake to eat about a half hour before lunch. It will give your body the fuel it needs to complete a workout that's brief, but intense.You also want to make sure you have a complete, protein-filled breakfast. Try cereal with almonds, yogurt, or eggs.
Your snack should be small, especially if part of the reason you're exercising is to lose weight. If you consume too many calories before your workout, you won't burn as much fat.
Check the ingredient labels of protein or energy bars carefully before you buy them. You don't want something that has too many calories, or has significant amounts of sugar or chemical preservatives.

, You want to make sure you're eating lunch soon after you finish your workout. Exercising during your lunch break is not an excuse to skip a meal. Instead, eat something with plenty of protein and complex carbohydrates to help your body recover.A sandwich with lean meat such as chicken or turkey can be a good option, and the bread will supply carbs your body needs to recover from your workout and rebuild muscles. Choose whole grains which digest more slowly. The extra fiber and protein will sustain your energy better.
A salad also provides good nutrition, and can be prepared relatively quickly. Use olive oil, or a light vinaigrette instead of heavier salad dressings such as ranch.
Many people have difficulty processing dairy immediately after exercise, so keep cheese or creamy dressings or sauces to a minimum.

, Particularly if your lunch was low in carbs, you may want to try a post-workout recovery bar or shake that provides your body with the energy it needs to fully recover and get you through the rest of the day.As with your pre-workout snack, read ingredient labels carefully before you buy a pre-packaged product. Avoid snacks that are overly processed or high in sugar.
If you prefer to graze, keep a healthy snack such as almonds around your work area for when you feel the need to snack.

Plan your routine in advance.,
Pack your duffel bag the night before.,
Use a gym close to work.,
Wear clothes that are easy to change in and out of.,
Streamline your personal care routine.",How to Exercise During Your Lunch Break4," You'll save a lot of time if you know exactly what you're going to do, as well as when and where you're going to do it. A lack of planning can result in you spinning your wheels and not getting much out of your workout.The simplest lunchtime workout is to go for a quick run or use an elliptical machine or similar apparatus that will give you a good cardio workout.
You can use ankle and wrist weights for brief bouts of a minute at a time to add resistance to your cardio workout. Remember that wearing weights on the wrists and ankles can cause injuries to the shoulders, hips knees and ankles. Don't wear them longer than 10 minutes.
If you plan to work out at a gym and you don't feel comfortable planning your routine yourself, check and see if there are any classes available midday that you can take.
Signing up for a class won't help if the time you take your lunch break varies. If that's the case for you, you'll have to come up with a routine you can do on your own. You might be able to watch a class to get some ideas for what to include in your routine.

, Gather your workout clothes and any personal care items and put them in a bag so they're ready to go. Set them by the door and take them with you when you go to work so you don't have to make a trip back home.Include gym clothes that are light and breathable, and that won't trap excess sweat on the body.
Make sure you pack clean underwear. These garments will absorb the most sweat, and you likely won't want to wear them for the rest of the day.
Slip in a small bag for toiletries that you'll need to freshen up after your workout, including deodorant or anti-perspirant. Face wipes or baby wipes are a good choice for a quick clean-up.

, If you plan to work out at a gym or fitness center, find one ideally within walking distance from your workplace so you won't spend too much time commuting to and from the gym.One benefit of walking to the gym is that the walk can double as a warm up, so once you get to the gym you're ready to work out.
If you're already a member of a gym close to your house, find out if that gym has another location that's closer to where you work.

, If you're going to exercise during your lunch break, it generally isn't the day to wear a fussy, delicate blouse or a complicated suit that takes time to put on and has to be hung up in a certain way.If your work attire is business casual, it shouldn't be difficult to plan your work attire around your lunchtime workout.
A dressier office may require more planning, but try to choose garments that you can put on and take off with ease, and that can be folded rather than hung up.
Throw a dryer sheet in your gym bag to keep your work clothes fresh while you're working out.

, You likely won't have time to take a full shower and get ready for work after your lunch-break workout using the same routine you use to get ready in the morning.Wiping yourself down with a cleansing wipe should suffice to freshen you up for the rest of the day. Towel off thoroughly after your workout to make sure your skin isn't damp from sweat.
Make sure you apply deodorant or anti-perspirant after your workout. You may want to pack an anti-perspirant body spray, particularly if you tend to sweat profusely after a workout.
Your streamlining should begin when you get ready in the morning as well. For example, if you typically wear makeup to work, it's probably not a good idea to put on a full face of makeup if you plan to exercise during your lunch break.
Look for products that do double duty. For example, instead of wearing foundation you might want to use a tinted moisturizer. A little powder on the nose, chin and brows can help refresh your post-exercise face.

Be patient.,
Apply petroleum jelly or vaseline.,
Add a sugar scrub to your routine.,
Apply a tea bag.,
Wear a moisturizing lip balm.,
Avoid flavors, dyes, or fragrances.",How to Have Amazingly Soft Lips1," Whatever strategy you use, develop it as a routine. Your lips might not be the desired softness immediately. It will take time.


Your routine might be daily. You can exfoliate and clean your lips after your brush teeth in the morning and at night. This habit will get you in the daily routine.
It is recommended, if you are using a scrub, to use it twice a week.;
, You can apply this on your lips using your finger or a toothbrush. The toothbrush may help exfoliate your lips or work the jelly into your lips.

, You can make a honey lip scrub to use to both exfoliate and to moisturize your lips. This will make your lips extra soft.


A simple sugar scrub is 1 cup sugar and ½ cup olive oil, mixed together and applied as a paste.There are many great and easy recipes to make your own sugar scrubs.These recipes usually involve only a few ingredients including sugar, oils, and water. Check out Make-Honey-Lip-Scrub for an easy recipe.

, This trick may sound a little odd, but scientists have shown that a tea bag can help revitalize skin.After you have steeped your tea in hot water, apply the bag directly to your lips for 3-5 minutes. You will notice softer lips.


To do this, you can use any type of tea. Green tea is especially good because of its antioxidants.
Squeeze the extra water out of the tea bag before apply it to your lips.

, A good tip is to own a few different lip balms and put them in different jackets or purses. This will ensure that you will always have one on you., Artificial additives can dry out your lips and make them appear less healthy. Staying with natural products is always a better solution for your lips.

Eat breakfast, even if you're not hungry.,
Eat about every four hours to prevent a spike and dip in blood sugar.,
Don't go overboard on caffeine after noon.,
Stay hydrated with water during the day.,
Get more fiber into your diet.,
Eat plenty of healthy fats.",How to Get More Energy1," Breakfast is probably the most important meal of the day in terms of energy.It gets your metabolism going and is probably the one meal that you can afford to splurge on. Breakfast primes you for the rest of the day. Researchers have even found that a little breakfast cereal in the morning is linked to lower amounts of the stress hormone cortisol.If you're worried about weight, don't skip breakfast. Have a complete breakfast, a smaller lunch, and perhaps a snack for dinner. Eating in the morning is far preferable to eating at night for people trying to lose weight.;
, Eating three large meals spaced out five to six hours can take more energy to digest, causing a huge surge in blood sugar, followed by a fall off a cliff. The idea is to keep blood sugar levels stable all day instead of letting them rise and fall.


Eat foods that will sustain you. At every small meal, choose either carbs (preferably complex), protein, or healthful fats (omega-3, monounsaturated, etc.). These foods will help keep you from feeling hungry an hour or two after eating.
Eat the same amount of food every three to four hours, or go for healthful snacks in between smaller meals. Examples of energizing but healthful snacks include:
Nuts
Olives
Yogurt
Fresh fruit
Legumes



, Just because a little bit is good doesn't mean that a lot is better. Just ask the over-caffeinated person who has trouble getting to sleep at a reasonable hour at night because they've consumed more caffeine that is healthy or balanced. 200 to 300 milligrams of caffeine should be your upper limit — any more and you'll be bouncing off the walls at night and slugging out of bed in the morning., Doctors and scientists alike believe that drinking water is a key component to being healthier and feeling more energized during the day, although there is some disagreement about how much is needed.


One camp says that you should drink enough water to stay satiated. Drink whenever you're thirsty, but be aware of the color of your urine: if it gets too yellow, up your fluid intake (especially water).
Another camp says that humans should drink between 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) (for women) and 3 liters (0.79 US gal) (for men) per day.Know that alcohol or caffeine can make you dehydrated, so you'll probably need more water to compensate. If you do drink alcohol or caffeine regularly, be aware of that.


, Fiber releases energy at a slow, steady rate, unlike simple carbohydrates, for example, giving your body more energy to work with over a longer time.Some foods that you might consider eating or snacking on that are high in fiber:


Breakfast cereal such as raisin bran, or oatmealBeans or legumes such as black beans or edamame
Popcorn
Pear or apple, with skin
Whole wheat pasta

, People are scared of fats, and sometimes justifiably so. But not all fats are created equal. Omega-3 fats especially, but also monounsaturated fats, can be healthy and even energy-rich.Omega-3 fatty acids, found in nuts, fish, and certain vegetable oils (canola), will help you feel mentally alert in addition to giving your diet a healthy makeover.

, Be it your family or friends, talking to people that you like helps you keep in a cheerful frame of mind.

, This is a key point to remember. Always remember that you are allowed to stop thinking whenever you want. You don't have to calculate how long will it take to end the road trip you are on. It's useless to do so and only hinders your enjoyment of the trip. All the useless thinking should be thrown out.

, Go to places you have never been before. Talk to complete strangers. Try new things with a smile on your face. Have new experiences, try new foods, new hobbies, new music and new forms of entertainment.

, you can now choose any pair of comfortable heels to wear out, because pretty much anything goes with an L.B.D..

, You don’t have much time, so tonight is not the night to be adventurous with make up.


Rinse your face with water and pat dry. Lightly moisturise but not too much or your foundation will appear shiny.
Cover any red marks with concealer.
Apply foundation as per usual.
Lightly dust the face with bronzer.
Get an eye brush and lightly apply bronzer to your eyelids. This will add a bit more colour but you can’t go wrong because it’s your bronzer and so should adjust to your skin.

Pucker your lips and suck your cheeks in.,
Press and hold the indentations.,
Smile and reposition your fingers as necessary.,
Continue pressing for 30 minutes or more.,
Repeat daily.",How to Get Dimples Naturally1," To start exercising your cheek muscles, make a face as though you just ate a lemon or something remarkably sour. Your lips should be in a slight pucker or pout and your cheeks should be partially sucked in. Your teeth should not be clenched together, as this can prevent you from sucking your cheeks in, but your lips do need to be closed.










Note - this method is a folk remedy. In other words, it's not supported by any sort of scientific evidence, but rather by vague, unverifiable, anecdotal evidence. Thus, it is not guaranteed to work.

Your cheeks should naturally indent inward, with the deepest part of the indentation resting in between your top and bottom teeth, roughly halfway between the front and back of your mouth.
Try eating or drinking something sour if you have a hard time imagining the appropriate facial expression - your natural reaction to sourness is what this exercise is imitating.;
, Locate the areas on your cheeks where the indentations are the deepest. Gently hold this spot down on both cheeks using both index fingers. Keep your fingers firmly fixed to these spots as you prepare to move your mouth.









You can also hold these spots with your thumb or the rounded end of a pencil if you find it easier.

, Gradually ease your expression into a wide grin, keeping your fingers fixed to the same spots on your face. Your smile should be wide and open-mouthed, as natural dimples generally appear when someone has a fairly wide smile. Your fingers should now be positioned near the corners of your smile, where dimples would naturally occur if you had them.









Check your appearance in a mirror. If the location of your fingertips seems slightly off, you may need to slightly slide your fingertips across your cheeks to the proper location.
Press your desired dimple area firmly with your fingertips or with the rounded end of a pencil. For temporary dimples, release immediately. Take a picture, if desired.Note that these dimples will disappear as soon as you relax your mouth.

, To train your cheeks into forming more lasting dimples, you will need to continue to firmly hold these indentations in place for at least 30 minutes.


The longer you can hold your “dimple” marks in place, the more luck you will have in getting them to last.
In the past, there were actually mechanical devices aimed at creating dimples by applying consistent pressure to these spots on your face.These devices were never scientifically proven to work, but some swore by them. This dimple exercise mimics the action of such a machine.

, Continue practicing 30-minute dimple “exercises” on a daily basis for several weeks. If a month passes and you still have not created lasting dimples, you may want to move on. Since this technique is not supported by scientific evidence, but by hearsay, if you don't eventually have success, it may simply not work for you.

Turn off the bright lights and TV screens after 8.,
Don't keep looking at your alarm clock.,
Consider sleeping alone.,
Don't have that drink before bed.,
If you can't fall asleep, stop trying.,
Sleep with the temperature down.",How to Get More Energy2," Bright lights can upset the body's release of melatonin, which tells you when it's time to go to bed (and helps you fall asleep).Adjusting your exposure to light in the hours before sleep will help you fall asleep easier and get a better night's sleep.


Dim your lights an hour before getting ready for bed. Invest in a dimmer if you haven't already. Dim lights will help your body start producing melatonin, giving you a better chance of falling sleep early.
Turn off bright computer monitors and TV screens after 8. If you have trouble getting to sleep early on in the night, bright computer monitors and TV screens are your enemy. If you have to be connected, try to dim the lights on the computer so that your overall exposure to light is less.

, Waiting for your alarm clock to hit a certain time — and stressing about how late it's getting — may actually keep you from getting a restful sleep. It seems like the harder you try to fall asleep, the harder it is to actually do.The solution: turn your alarm clock so that it's facing away from you. Or even better: place your alarm clock on the other side of the room so that you can't see it and you have to get out of bed in order to turn it off in the morning.

, For those who like to snuggle with their partner at night, the results may seem alarming: researchers found that people who sleep in the same bed as their partners woke up during the night, experienced major disturbances, and got less restful sleep.If you suffer from chronic fatigue, talk with your partner about sleeping alone at least a couple nights per week.


Don't invite your pet in on the sleepover. A study by Mayo Clinic Sleep Disorders Center found that 53% of pet owners who slept with their pets experienced a major sleep disturbance during the night., People who have an alcoholic beverage before bed have a higher likelihood of waking up in the middle of the night when the body finishes processing the alcohol, studies say.When you're sober, your parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) lowers your heart rate, giving you a restful sleep. When your body is processing alcohol, your sympathetic nervous system never gives up the reigns to the PNS, leaving you more tired than you would have been had you fallen asleep naturally.

, If, after 15 minutes of trying to go to sleep, you find that you can't, get out of bed and read, write, or find another soothing activity. (Remember, no bright lights or TV screens!) Not being able to go to sleep, and trying really hard to do so, can produce stress, which will ultimately keep you awake longer. Finish your activity and then try to go to sleep again.

, Cool environments help the body get better sleep. That's because cool temperatures help bring on the drop in core temperature that signals sleepiness.


What's the ideal temperature at which to fall asleep? Scientists say that a relatively cool temperature of between 60 and 68 degrees is optimal for getting to sleep.Studies have found that insomniacs have higher core temperatures right before they get into bed.If you're having trouble getting to sleep, try dropping the temperature pretty low and putting a hot water bottle in between your feet.A hot water bottle will rapidly dilate blood vessels, which can help regulate the body's internal temperature.

, If you stay in your pajamas, sweats, or birthday suit all day long, you may trick your brain into thinking it has an excuse to be lazy. If you get dressed in ""normal"" attire, however, you're telling yourself that there are things to do, people to see, and happiness to be found. We all know how comforting those sweats can be. But when it's time to get out of bed and be active, they're not as energy-producing as you might have hoped.

, People who have problems that are vexing them keep them inside for all sorts of reasons: they don't want to bother other people, they're afraid of how other people may judge them, or they simply feel they don't have the time to vent. Not being able to find a good emotional release for problems can be taxing to your energy.


Have a talk with one of your close friends. Confide in someone you can trust. Lay your feelings bare. Trust that the person you're confiding in has your best interest at heart and wants to help, if not hear you out. Getting rid of your anxiety in this way may help to lower stress and keep you energized longer.
Write down your feelings in a journal every day. If you don't have someone you feel you can confide it, a journal is a perfect substitute. Write down your feelings, your hopes, your aspirations. Simply putting them on paper can feel oddly relaxing and transforming.

If you don't exercise regularly, try fitting a little bit of exercise into your daily routine. Walking for 30 minutes a day can be a huge boon to your health and energy levels.


Make time for office exercise. Whether it's sitting on an exercise ball instead of an office chair, doing stretches in front of your computer, or carving out time to walk during your lunch break, being at the office is no longer an excuse not to exercise.

Draw a small crescent moon shape on your cheek.,
Blend and re-draw as necessary.,
Smile to check your results.",How to Get Dimples Naturally2," Look into a mirror and smile a wide but natural smile. Gauge the general location where you want your fake dimples to be.









When you smile, natural creases should form outside of your mouth. Your “dimples” should fall just outside of these creases, beginning roughly around the area just above the upper points of your lips.
Make sure to smile broadly, but not unnaturally so. Real dimples are most prominent during particularly wide smiles, so you will get a better idea for where your cosmetic dimples should be if you make a wide grin, rather than a reserved one. Don't be shy!

Note - this method works best to create temporary dimples suitable for pictures. It may look unnatural if worn out in public.

, Dimples usually appear as short lines or slight crescent shapes. Using a dark brown pencil eyeliner or eyebrow pencil, make a small dot at the top of where you want your desired dimple line to be.









Dark brown works bests because it blends into the skin more naturally. Black and colored eyeliner should be avoided.

, With the tops of your dimples marked, relax your mouth. Draw a small, slightly curved line starting at the dot you have marked. Use the same eyeliner or eyebrow pencil you used to create the dot.








The line should extend no further than 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the dot. It should be just barely curved - slightly straighter than the curve of a fingernail.

, Now that your dimples have been drawn on, you need to adjust your makeup so that the final product appears subtle and natural. Use your fingers or a smudge stick to blend the line into your skin, rubbing the line up and down rather than side to side.









One application may not create a line of suitable darkness, so you may need to draw over the line and blend it in several times.

, Critique your new dimples in the mirror - are they even? Are they too dark? Not dark enough? Do your dimples look unnatural in certain types of lighting? If anything about your makeup doesn't seem quite right, don't be afraid to wash it off and try again.

Go to a professional piercer.,
Clean the area thoroughly.,
Make sure that the tools are also clean.,
Get pierced.,
Maintain proper treatment after the piercing is done.,
Leave the piercings in for one to three months.",How to Get Dimples Naturally3," Like all piercings, cheek piercings carry a risk of infection if performed without regard for proper sanitation. Do not attempt to perform a cheek piercing at home. Only go to reputable, qualified professionals - ones that have the training and tools necessary to minimize your risk of infection or complication.

Most professional body piercers will refuse to perform a dimple piercing on anyone under the age of 18, even with a guardian's permission. The precise age cutoff, however, differ based in the laws in your state or country.

Note - many professional body piercers discourage dimple piercings at all ages. While ear and nose piercings only cut through skin and cartilage, dimple piercings cut through muscle. As a result, there is a greater risk of nerve damage than with other complications.

, If your piercer is a qualified, reputable one, s/he will clean your cheeks carefully before proceeding with the piercing.The exterior of the skin must be cleaned with anti-bacterial soap, sterile alcohol wipes, or similar method of sterilization to eliminate harmful microorganisms that can cause complications with the piercing.

The body piercer may also ask that you rinse your mouth out with bacteria-busting mouthwash to minimize the risk of harmful bacteria from the inside of your mouth infecting the piercing.

, Reputable body piercers will use a piercing gun that uses disposable one-use needles, one that's washed in a sterilizing autoclave, or a single-use disposable needle on its own (no gun). The needle used to pierce your cheek must be sterile beyond a shadow of a doubt. Never, ever receive a piercing using a dirty needle. In addition:

The needle may also be heated before use to further sterilize it.
The hands of the body piercer should also be washed thoroughly with anti-bacterial soap. The body piercer may or may not wear disposable gloves.
The jewelry should also be cleansed in anti-bacterial solution.

, The body piercer will use the needle to quickly puncture the skin at the exact location where natural dimples would fall. Immediately after piercing the skin, the body piercer should place the jewelry into the holes and treat the punctured area with more anti-bacterial solution., New piercings require special care to reduce the risk of infection or complication. Ask your piercer for instructions - you will probably need to clean the pierced area with saline solution several times each day until the piercing heals.

The body piercer may provide you with a solution, but if not, you can make one by adding 1 tsp (5 ml) of salt to 8 oz (250 ml) of pure distilled water.
Apply the saline solution with a sterile cotton swab. Swab the area next to the jewelry rod and gently clean beneath the head of the jewelry.
Avoid playing with the jewelry as it heals. Fiddling with your jewelry can transfer bacteria from your hand into the wound, and also causes the piercing to shift from its original location, irritating the wound.

, It will usually take at least this long for the piercing to heal. The piercing needs to heal with the jewelry in before it can be safely removed. Removing the jewelry prematurely may allow the piercings in your cheeks to close up. Waiting at least one month (and up to three) should provide your cheeks ample time to partially heal.

As soon as you remove the piercings, your skin will begin the process of healing itself. Until the skin heals, you will have two small holes in your cheek. After the skin heals, however, you should be left with two dimple-like indentations in your cheek.
Take care, during this time, to keep track of the types of jewelry you are wearing in your dimples. Some people can have allergic reactions to certain types of metal used in jewelry, especially cheaper varieties.

Note - piercings are semi-permanent! Your new ""dimples"" will be in your cheeks at all times, regardless of the expression on your face.

Eat high-calorie whole foods.,

Try creatine supplements.",How to Get Bigger Legs," This is the single best exercise you can do to get big, thick thighs, since it engages the most muscle fibers in the area. Hold a barbell bearing weight you can lift for 10-12 reps.









Stand with your feet shoulder-length apart.
Bend your knees and squat so that your thighs are parallel to the floor.
Hold the squat for 10 seconds.
Push back up.
Repeat 10-12 times for 3 sets.;
, Load the leg extension machine with the heaviest amount of weight you can lift for 10 or so reps.









Sit on the leg extension machine with your knees bent and your feet under the lower bar.
Straighten your legs to lift the weight, then lower it.
Repeat 10 - 12 times for 3 sets.

, You'll need to use a leg curl machine that allows you to lift weights by attaching a cable to your ankle. Load the machine with as much weight as you can lift for 10 reps.








Fasten the cable to your ankle with the harness.
Grab the support bar with your hands.
Bend your knee toward your butt to lift the weight. Straighten your knee and put your foot back on the ground.
Repeat 10-12 times for 3 sets, then switch to the other leg.

, This exercise pumps your leg muscles from a different angle. Load the machine with as much weight as you can lift for 10 reps.








Lie face-down on the bench with your legs straight and your ankles under the lever.
Bend your knees and lift the lever toward your body.
Repeat 10 - 12 times for 3 sets.

, This exercise works your hamstrings, creating thicker legs. Load a barbell with as much weight as you can lift for 10 reps.








Stand with your feet shoulder width apart.
Bend at the waist, keeping your legs straight, and grasp the barbell with your hands.
Keeping your legs stiff, lift the barbell to your thighs.
Lower the barbell back to the floor.
Repeat 10-12 times for 3 sets.

, Even if you do all the exercises listed with religious regularity, you're not going to get bigger legs unless you make your workouts as intense as you can stand. In order for muscle to build effectively, you need to break down the fibers and have them build back up stronger and bigger. Doing this requires working out as hard as you can, every time.









For each exercise, use as much weight as you can lift using the correct form for about 10 reps. If you can lift the weight easily for 15 reps, it's too light. If you can't lift it more than 5 times, it's too heavy.
As the weeks go on, you'll need to add weight to keep up the intensity. Your muscles will stagnate if you don't lift more as they get stronger and bigger.

, Doing the exercises quickly and with explosive energy, rather than slowly, builds muscle faster.You'll also be able to do more reps this way. Instead of working out slowly, increase the intensity by going through your sets as quickly as possible.








, It's important to change up your workout routine every other week so that your muscles don't get so used to doing the same exercises that they stop growing. Keeping your muscles in a state of ""shock"" will force them to continue the process of breaking down and building back up ever bigger and stronger.


If you do a hard workout that includes squats, leg extensions, and leg curls one week, switch to stiff-legged deadlifts, lying leg curls and squats the next week.
Adding weight is another way to keep from plateauing, so make sure you don't stagnate at a weight that's too light., Your muscles need time to rest and repair when you aren't working out. You can keep exercising, but don't do anything that's too strenuous for your legs.









Try swimming, walking, or playing basketball or tennis if you want to work out between leg workouts.
Make sure you get plenty of sleep so your body has time to mend.

, You're going to need a lot of calories to fuel the growth of your leg muscles, which are some of the largest in your body. Eat big meals filled with high quality foods that nourish your body and keep you full and satisfied.


Meat, whole grains, beans, vegetables, fruits, and nuts are good foods to consume when you're in a muscle-building program.
Eat more than you think you need. During an intensive workout program you are going to need a lot of calories, and you'll probably need to eat at least 5 big meals a day.
Avoid empty calories from fast food, cakes, cookies, chips, and other snack foods that will make you feel run down instead of energized.

, Protein is essential to building healthy muscles, so make sure you're getting a lot of it at every meal. Beef, pork, chicken, fish and lamb are all fine choices. Eggs and beans are good substitutes for those who don't eat a lot of meat.

, Some people find that they can accelerate the process of muscle growth by taking creatine. Creatine is a nitrogenous organic acid that occurs naturally in vertebrates and helps to supply energy to all cells in the body, primarily muscle. This is achieved by increasing the formation of adenosine triphosphate.


Creatine comes in a powdered form. You mix it with water and drink it 2-3 times per day.
Creatine is considered to be completely safe to use in doses of 20 grams (0.71 oz) for long periods of time. Always read the directions given."

Consider purchasing a facial exercise program.,
Smile.,
Clench and release your jaw.,
Practice chin lifts.,
Massage your temples.,
Make a fish face.",How to Get a Chiseled Jawline1," If you're really serious about toning up the look of your jawline, there are actually programs available you can purchase that will run you through a wide variety of exercises and face-improving motions. Compared to most other fitness programs, they're relatively cheap and quite convenient to follow up on., Smiling comes more naturally to some people than others, but the fact remains that it has a laundry list of benefits to the muscles in your face. As it goes with the rest of your body, the more you exercise your face, the better and tighter it'll look. Smiling is a great exercise because it is psychologically tied in with the experience of being happy, so it's not uncommon to notice an improvement in your mood if you make a regular habit of smiling on impulse., Getting a better jawline is correlative to working the jaw itself. To do this, try clenching your jaw for 10 seconds before releasing it. This should come with a sense of mild discomfort as well as a subtle burn. Try doing this as many times as you want-- between 10 and 15 should be a good place to start in terms of reps.As time goes on, you should increase the amount of time you're clenching your jaw. This will encourage your jaw to continue toning.
Jaw clenching is generally quite easy to fit into a daily routine. Due to the fact that it doesn't look as apparent and silly as many other facial exercises, it's even something you can do at work or on the train.

, Tilt your head upwards and keep your eyes fixed on the ceiling. Next, strain your lips, as if you were trying to kiss something an inch above you. Maintain the strain for 5 seconds per rep, after which you should relax and give your lips a few seconds to recuperate. You can repeat this exercise as many times as you'd like, although 10 is a good place. This exercise is a great way to improve facial tightness, as the direction and strain work out a wide variety of facial muscles., Massaging your temples and unfurling your brow is a good way to encourage blood flow and circulation throughout your face. Take two fingers from each hand and rub your temples in small, circular motions. Continue this for 30 seconds per session.


Massaging temples is best known as a way to combat migraine headaches.

, Making a 'fish face' is a great exercise for toning up your cheeks and jaw. Suck in your cheeks from inside your mouth and try smiling. Hold the form for at least 5 seconds per rep. It should feel mildly uncomfortable, and by the end of each rep, you should feel a light burn. This is a good thing, as it demonstrates your muscles have been strained by the activity. Repeat this 10 times for a good starting exercise, and feel free to increase the number of reps as it suits you.Exercises like the fish face are very easy to work into your daily routine, so long as you remember to do them. You can do them in the shower or before going to sleep.

If you have dry, cracked lips, you need to condition your lips instead of trying to cover them up. A light lip scrub can do the trick in a matter of minutes. There's no need to buy a special scrub; just mix one up at home. Here's what to do:








Mix a teaspoon of sugar and a teaspoon of honey.
Wet your lips with warm water.
Rub the scrub over your lips in a circular motion.
Rinse your lips, and repeat if necessary.;
, If your lips are too dry to be corrected with a scrub, try using a toothbrush to do the job. Wet your lips and rub a clean toothbrush over them using a gentle circular motion. Rinse your lips and repeat if you still see skin flakes there.









Make sure you use a soft-bristled brush, and not one with stiff bristles. You don't want to cut or scrape the skin on your lips, since irritating them will just make the problem worse.
If your lips are cracked, you may need to repeat the process over the course of several days. After exfoliating your lips, moisturize them and wait until the next day to exfoliate again. Repeat until your lips are in tip-top condition.

, A lip serum is similar to a face mask, but for your lips. It's a rich, nourishing mixture that deeply moisturizes and brightens your lips, with results lasting several days. After exfoliating your lips, apply a serum to bring out the best in your skin.









Mix 1 teaspoon honey or aloe with 1 teaspoon olive or coconut oil.
Rub the mixture into your lips.
Let the serum sit and absorb into your lips for ten minutes.
Rinse away the excess serum with warm water.

, If you long for bigger lips, there are ways to help your lips look their plumpest without using injections or expensive products. The key is to increase circulation in your lips by apply a substance that draws blood to the area. Mix up a natural lip plumper and apply it to your lips any time you want to give them a boost. Here are a few household supplies you can use:









A mixture of 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper and 1/2 teaspoon olive or coconut oil
A mixture of 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon olive or coconut oil
A mixture of 5 drops peppermint extract and 1/2 teaspoon olive or coconut oil
Or use this quick solution: rub a piece of freshly cut ginger or a cut jalapeno pepper over your lips

, Your lips are exposed to all kinds of substances that can dry them out on a daily basis. Hot and cold temperatures, food and beverages you consume, wind, sun, and air pollution all have an effect on the state of your lips. Protect them every day by using a good moisturizing lip balm to provide a thin barrier between your lips and the rest of the world.









Look for a balm made with natural substances. Key ingredients that moisturize your lips include coconut oil or butter, shea butter, and vitamin E oil.
To make your own healthy balm, simply melt together 2 tablespoons coconut oil and 1 tablespoon beeswax. You can scent the mixture with five drops of your favorite essential oil. Pour it into a clean lip balm jar and allow it to cool before using.

, If your lips are in good condition, it doesn't take much makeup to make them look beautiful and healthy. If you're not the type who likes to wear layers of color on your lips, try a simple tinted lip balm to add a hint of luster. Tinted lip balm comes in any color you want, or you can make your own in exactly the color you want. Here's how to do it:









Make a simple balm by melting together 2 tablespoons coconut oil and 1 tablespoon beeswax.
Cut off a small piece of your favorite lipstick and stir it in while the mixture is still hot. Add as much or as little as you want to tint your lip balm.
Pour the balm into a clean lip balm jar and allow it to cool before using.

, If you have no qualms about using bold color to make your lips look great, it's important to know how to choose the right shades to match your complexion. Every skin tone can be classified as warm, cool, or neutral. Learn more about your skin ""temperature"" to choose the right lipstick.If your coloring looks best in earth tones, warm yellows and reds, and gold jewelry, your skin is warm. Choose lipstick with warm undertones, like browns, orange-reds, coral pinks, and creamy neutrals.
If you tend to look best in jewel tones, navy blue, and silver jewelry, your skin is cool. Choose lipstick with cool undertones, like plums, cherry reds, lavender pinks, and pearly neutrals.

, Make sure your lips are conditioned before you apply lipstick; otherwise it will flake off, leaving your lips looking mottled. Apply lipstick to your bottom lip, making sure you don't go outside your natural lip line. Rub your lips together to apply lipstick to your top lip. Dot more lipstick on your top and bottom lips to fill in any gaps.








Blotting your lips on a tissue will help set your lipstick and prevent it from getting on your teeth and cups you might drink from throughout the day.
If you want your lipstick to last all day without wearing off, use a lip primer on your lips before applying color.

, Liner isn't mandatory for everyday use, but for days when you want your lips to really turn heads, it's indispensable. Choose liner in a color that matches the lip color you want to use. Use it to carefully outline the shape of your lips before you apply lipstick. The liner will define the shape of your mouth and keep your lip color from ""bleeding.""









You can also use liner to change the shape of your lips. Trace the liner slightly above or below your natural lip line to make your lips look larger. When you fill in your lips with color, no one will be able to tell the difference.
You can create a slight ombre effect by using liner a shade darker or lighter than the lip shade you're using.

, After applying color, you might want to add a layer of clear gloss to make your lips stand out even more. Gloss adds plenty of shine and also helps keep your lipstick in place. Choose a clear gloss or one with a little shimmer depending on the look you're going for.









Gloss is completely optional, especially if you prefer your lips to look matte instead of shiny.
Coconut oil works well as a cheap homemade lip gloss.

, Lips, like the rest of your skin, need protection from the sun's rays in order to stay healthy. Sun exposure can lead to darker lips as well as causing them to dry out. Choose a daily lip balm with an SPF of 15 or higher to keep your lips in good shape, especially during the summer.








If you make your own lip balm, you can add sun protection by stirring in zinc oxide powder.Coconut oil also provides a bit of protection on its own.
If you don't like wearing balm, wear a wide-brimmed hat to shade your face on the sunniest days.

, Depending on where you live, air humidity might be lowest in either the summer or the winter. Even before you notice your lips are starting to feel dry and flaky, take extra care to keep them moisturized. Wear lip balm when you go outside to protect your skin from the elements.









You may want to apply lip balm before you go to sleep to keep your lips from chapping overnight, especially if you sleep with your mouth open.
Try using a humidifier in your bedroom to keep your lips and skin moisturized.

, Drinking plenty of water is key to having great-looking lips. When your body is dehydrated, your lips are often the first place where it shows. Drink water throughout the day so your lips never get the chance to dry out.


Try replacing coffee and alcohol with water whenever possible, since water is better for your lips.
Salty foods dry out your lips, so when you eat salt, make up for it by drinking extra water.

, Many lip products use alcohol, fragrances, and dyes to create long-lasting color. Some lipsticks even contain lead, which can lead to health problems if ingested in large quantities. You don't have to throw out your lipstick collection, but it pays to be aware of what you're putting on your lips, and to go natural as often as possible.

, Smoking can cause lips to dark, thin and wrinkle. Using tobacco products is definitely counter productive when it comes to having great lips. If you want your lips to look beautiful (in addition to many other health benefits) do your best to quit smoking as soon as possible."

Drink water.There are too many benefits for drinking lots of water to give proper justice here.,
Consume less salt in your diet.,
Get enough sleep at night.,
Stop smoking.,
Chew gum.",How to Get a Chiseled Jawline2," Suffice to say, pure H2O intake is a necessary (and shockingly underrated) way of improving your overall health. Drinking water aids in weight loss and improved energy throughout the day. What's more, the surplus moisture will improve circulation throughout your face. Most of its benefits affect your jawline only indirectly, but it's one of the best ways to go about affecting positive physical change.


If you have excess weight to lose, drinking water is a great way to shed pounds, as it will keep you feeling full without the excess calories associated with soda pop and junk food.
Drinking water has also been proven to accelerate the body's metabolism., Salt is one of the most overabundant ingredients in a modern diet, and it does terrible things to the skin. Finding ways of limiting salt in your diet (including focusing on a whole-foods diet and cutting out junk food) will have many positive benefits for your skin. Your skin will carry less water, making it less bloated and consequently more difficult for your jawline to appear.A lot of alternative diets are built around the idea of strictly limiting salt intake. Do some research, and find a diet plan that works for you and your lifestyle.

, You've no doubt been told before that you need at least 8 hours of sleep per evening. Most people usually try to get by with 5 or 6. However, if you're looking to get your jawline looking its best, you're going to need to aim for the full 8 for your body take proper care of itself., Like salt or lack of sleep, smoking can be disastrous for the look of one's skin. If you are a regular smoker and want a better jawline, it can't hurt to quit smoking.

Chewing gum has a lot of surprising benefits, not least of which is sharpening up your facial muscles. The enduring exercise should see results over the course of a few weeks. Best of all, it's a pretty fun thing to do, so it won't take much out of you to make a habit of it."

Consider growing a beard if you lack a strong jawline.,
Give your beard a defined neck line.Growing a beard can have a significant effect on the look of your jawline.,
Choose shirt collars to suit your face shape.,
Maintain your beard on a regular basis.,
Moisturize regularly.",How to Get a Chiseled Jawline3," Not all of us will be born with a naturally chiseled jaw. If this is the case, growing a beard is arguably the best way of adding fullness your face.Also consider the general size of your face. Beards tend to make faces look smaller by contrast; if you have a larger face, growing a beard might help to even things out. On the contrary, if your face is naturally small, you'll want to keep your beard short and trim.

, One mistake guys make very often is to trim their neckline too high, usually matching the arc of their jaw. This has the effect of making the jaw look weaker and less defined. If you tend to trim your beard with a higher neck line, try growing it lower than you usually would, all the while making sure the line is well-defined and reasonably well-maintained.


If you're having any trouble deciding where your beard's neckline should be, try to imagine a line running in an arc from one ear to the other. This should extend well below the jawline, and should give it a look of greater fullness., It's a general rule in the fashion world that any stylistic choice are affected by its surrounding areas. Shirts aren't generally associated or picked based on the shape of one's face, but it becomes more important if you're trying to emphasize your jawline.Oval faces have their widest point at the cheekbones, and are long compared to other face shapes. If you have an ovoid face, consider yourself fortunate; your face is very versatile and can suit a range of styles.
Those with round faces will want to pick clothes that make the face look longer. Tight-collared shirts are a great way to go about this.Angular faces (a box shape) suffer an opposite concern than the round faces; if your face is angular, you'll want to add a look of fullness to it. Wide-spread shirt collars can be a good help in this regard.

, Though it may seem the manly thing to do to let your beard run amok and grow freely, the look of your beard will be much more effective and impressive if you take the short amount of time each day it takes to keep it looking its best. This includes shaving hair that falls below your neckline, and trimming errant hairs that get too long. This controlled look for your beard will do wonders for your jawline., Skin blemishes and acne are quick and easy killers for hopes of a strong jawline. Even if you don't suffer these problems, just about every face can do with some added care. Regularly moisturizing is a great way to bring the look of your face up a notch.Moisturize with an oil-free solvent and give your face a cleanse every couple of days. Change won't come overnight, but you will see improvements as weeks go by.


This is all the more important if you have an existing skin condition, like acne.

Use a good skin toner.,
Use collagen-enhancing products on your skin.,
Accent your jaw with cosmetics.,
Consider surgical liposuction.",How to Get a Chiseled Jawline4," A great facial skin toner will prevent skin from sagging, meaning your face (and jaw) looking their tightest. Any buildup of excess dead skin flakes will rob your face of its natural vibrance and definition, so it's necessary to keep all of that under control if you're wanting a truly chiselled jawline.Aim to get an astringent toner, as these tend to be the best when it comes to skin tightening., Collagen is the active ingredient in the skin that keeps the skin tight. Some cleansers and toners encourage collagen production in your skin, so it's recommended you do some research when it comes to buying products. Collagen-specific medical injections are also available, but the unnatural side effects make it hard to recommend as anything but a last-ditch option.

, If you use makeup, you can emphasize the look of your jaw subtly via cosmetics. There are a few ways to do this; if you're not so used to using makeup, getting the effect right may take a few tries before you succeed. These techniques should be kept slight and subtle; this way, the human eye won't notice anything's been done to tweak your jaw's appearance.Contouring your cheek and jaw with a light bronzer will make your jawline more eye-catching. Apply it lightly in a downward motion, one or two shades darker than your natural skin tone.Highlighting your jawline lightly will emphasize its shape. Add a two inch line directly above your jawline. This will improve your jaw's visual definition.Taking a little bit of bronzer and dusting it along your jaw and neck will blend the above cosmetic effects. Be light with your application here; you just want to make it so that the contouring is blended a little better.

, As with virtually every other facial feature, surgeries are available to those who really want a quick fix. Digestive molecules are injected directly into the area you want to target, and burn down the excess fat, all the while encouraging positive collagen growth. Talk to a doctor if surgery sounds like something you might be interested in.If you're looking to get a chiselled jawline, cosmetic surgery is helpful and potentially effective, but the cost and possible side effects make it difficult to recommend unless you have exhausted all other possibilities first.

Focus your criticism on a particular situation.,
Keep criticism specific.,
Use objective language.,
Observe the impact of your comments.",How to Know the Difference Between Constructive and Non Constructive Criticism1," This means that rather than critiquing someone as a person, or a pattern in their behavior, you should keep the criticism focused on one incident. This way, the person receiving the criticism will understand that the problem is not with them as a person, and that they don’t necessarily always do things poorly.Keep criticism in the present. If you’re talking about something that happened long ago, or relating a current situation to something in the past, that may not be constructive.Refrain from saying things like, “This is the same thing you did last time, too,” or “I’ve noticed that you always do things that way.” Statements like that are not constructive and can be hurtful.
Instead, you can say, ""I noticed that you were late this morning,"" or, ""I noticed that your presentation today hadn't been edited."";
, Constructive criticism addresses specific flaws, and provides advice on how to improve on them. The receiver of critique is left with a clear idea of what actions to take in order to do better. An example of the difference between specific and vague criticism is:Specific: ""Some of the women feel that they're being talked over. It would be helpful if you spoke up if you noticed group members interrupting each other, or brushing off what others had to say. If certain members are feeling hesitant, you might even ask for their opinion to make sure people know their thoughts are valued.""
Vague: ""You aren't showing enough leadership. Your group is unsuccessful, and its atmosphere is unpleasant, particularly for the women. I expect to see better morale and more equal participation.""

, Objective language lets the person know that you’re not judging them. Objective language means simply stating the facts, or things you’ve observed. Your feedback does not negatively evaluate their personal attributes or abilities. An example of the difference between objective and judgemental language when talking to an artist is:Objective: ""The anatomy in this picture resembles a child’s, which contrasts with the more adult-like face. If she had a smaller head-to-body ratio and slightly longer limbs, she’d look more adult. Spending some extra time with anatomy books may be helpful to you.""
Judgemental: ""To be honest, you're lousy at drawing. All ego and no work ethic. I question how much commitment you have to art.""

, If you care about your comments being constructive, you'll want to make sure they had the desired impact. If the person seems particularly offended or hurt, you may have been too harsh.


If the person doesn't seem to take your comments to heart, you can ask them if they understood, and why they aren't making changes.
It's possible that you were too vague or gentle and the person didn't think the feedback was meant to incite direct change.

Figuring out what works best for you is the key to mastering Thai in the shortest duration. Thai is a complex language; from the alphabets to the pronunciation, it is a whole new world in every sense. Understand how you have incorporated new languages in the past. Are you a visual, auditive or kinesthetic learner? Do you prefer learning as you go or are you the kind who is more comfortable mastering details of the language from the comfort of your home before using it with native speakers? Establish your preferences before you delve in to learning the language.;
, If you are interested in learning Thai, there is a plethora of material on the market today. Teach Yourself Thai, Thai for Beginners and Speak Thai Vol.1 are some of the books available to help understand the basics of reading and speaking Thai. Make sentence flash cards from whatever you learn from the books and put these flashcards into the most popular language software known as Anki. Anki helps you learn Thai by keeping you on track with the process of learning on a daily basis. If you are one of those language buffs who happened to get inspired by the sound of the Thai language during your vacation, inquire details from your very own hotel and the Thais -as friendly as they are- are more than happy to help. Anantara Sikao Thailand Resort & Spa is one Trang Resort that will even link you up with a private tutor if required. A private tutor is particularly useful if you are having trouble connecting with the basics. Since they go at your own pace, they will complement whatever solo efforts you are taking in learning the language.

, Review, revise and repeat thoroughly and make sure you do not forget what you have learnt. Language is a skill mastered only by repetition. Make it a point to spend a little time every day revising what you have learnt. Go one step further in every new lesson; if you have learnt new words, incorporate them into sentences and if you are catching on sentences, make small paragraphs. Learn something new every day but don't forget to revise the old.

, Even though you still feel you have a long way to go to master Thai, occasionally come out of the cocoon and put to practice what you have learnt. This will help you assess what you have picked from weeks of learning books and sitting through tutorial sessions. The more you listen to locals confidently and carry on Thai conversations, the better you can build on the basics. Do not shy from using the language in simple situations. Always keep a dictionary at hand in case you get confused. At this point, keep it simple and do not be disheartened if you seem like you are struggling a bit.

, There is no better way to learn a language than entertaining yourself with it. Watch Thai movies and TV serials. Your urge to understand the story will subconsciously teach you the language. Listen to Thai songs and read Thai newspapers, books and magazines. This way, you master not only the art of reading and listening, but you also learn the art of pronunciation something that requires substantial practice especially with a language like Thai. It takes time and patience but soon you will be enjoying everything Thai.

, Once you have learnt Thai substantially well, speak the language. Make a Thai friend and talk Thai. Keep an ear open for the use of phrases and idioms because this is something you can catch on only during conversations. Talk and talk some more; the more you talk and listen to native responses, the faster you master the language.

Opt to further your education if you feel that you can increase your salary by doing so.,
Evaluate your current profession, and determine whether you need a change.,
Become more marketable to future employers by furthering your education and enhancing your value.,
Save your job by building upon your existing knowledge and sharpening your current skills.,
Stay abreast of the latest and greatest in your industry.",How to Know When You Need To Further Your Education," Those with degrees can expect to earn higher salaries, and the level of the degree is a determining factor as to how much. If you want to make more money, then you have to have something to offer in return. Check with your company regarding reimbursement programs that may assist you in your ongoing education efforts.;
, Maybe you are looking for more of a challenge, or maybe you are not happy with the politics in your current work situation. Whatever the reason, your need to continue your schooling may be a necessity, even if you are looking for a similar position but at a different company. Company requirements may have evolved since you last looked for a job, and positions that may not have required a degree, or certain qualifications, in the past, may be asking for them now. Even the job that you are in today may have higher expectations should you apply for the position today.

, By arming yourself with newer skills and making yourself more valuable, you are more likely to be eligible for a promotion. If this is your intention, then opt to enhance your qualifications and gain more knowledge so that you are the better choice when the time comes to promote within your company.

, In a fragile economy, nobody's job is safe. If there are concerns at your company about lay offs, then you should enhance your skills so that you are more of a valuable asset to your employers and less likely to lose your position there. Even if your investment in such education does not save your current job, it should make you more marketable in a job search.

, Your job may be ever evolving, as is technology, and so you should always be ahead of the game. Understanding newer technology will set you apart from your peers who may prefer to remain stagnant in their knowledge base.

Decide on your career goals.,
Get a better job.,
Find better opportunities.,
Overcome income inequality.,
Live a better life.,
Help your family.,
Live a longer life.,
Be happier in life.,
Find more fulfillment in life.",How to Know the Importance of Education," If you've thought about your future at all, you probably have some idea of what you want to do as a career. No matter what your goal is, it will probably require some degree of education.Search online for information about your desired career, or talk to professionals working in that field. There is a good chance that anyone you talk to will tell you that you'll need an education in order to enter that field. Note that the kind of education you will need may vary: some fields require formal college education, while others may lean more towards specialty training in the field.
In the United States, only 27 percent of jobs available nationwide require less than a high school degree. By contrast, students who have graduated from high school are deemed qualified for 39 percent of jobs available nationwide.Many people drop out of school thinking that they would rather work than be in school, but statistics show that the majority of high school dropouts are unemployed and have little or no source of income.;
, Even if the career you've chosen doesn't require an advanced education to break into the field, you will most likely need an education if you want to get promoted or earn a higher-paying job.People who have completed an advanced education typically make more money than people who have not gone to school.For example, in the United States, median weekly earnings in 2014 for people with only a high school diploma were $751 (men) and $558 (women).In contrast, the median weekly earnings for people with least a bachelor's degree were $1385 (men) and $1049 (women) in 2014. For people with an advanced degree, the median weekly wage was even higher: $1630 (men) and $1185 (women).Having a high school diploma dramatically increase the chances of earning a job over high school dropouts. That number continues to rise as students pursue higher education through college and graduate school., Getting an education opens a lot of professional doors for you. It can help you learn new skills, make professional connections, and generally have greater success.People who have completed an advanced education often have more and better opportunities available to them because of their education.Even if you have not completed a high school diploma, completing vocational training (education emphasizing a particular trade, such as electrician) will likely increase your income level and ability to find a job.If you have a high school education and vocational training, you are a much more attractive candidate for jobs.

, Studies have shown that having an education - even a primary education - can help low-income workers earn more money and find a better economic situation.Employers look for educational achievements. Even having a high school degree will reduce the risk of unemployment and increase the average lifetime earnings of most working adults.In the United States, 54 percent of high school dropouts between the ages of 16 and 24 are unemployed. For high school graduates, that number decreases to 32 percent of people in the same age bracket, and it decreases even further to 13 percent of college graduates., Beyond the professional opportunities that an education affords people, having an education may also be correlated with living a better life in general. Some studies suggest that people who stay in school are less likely to end up having legal troubles later in life.College graduates with a bachelor's degree earn an average of $1.64 million dollars more than high school dropouts over the course of a lifetime. High school graduates earn an average of $429,280 more than high school dropouts over the course of a lifetime.Having an education (and subsequently getting a better job) may make people less likely to commit crimes for fear of losing what they've worked for.The average high school dropout in America has a one in 10 chance of being arrested, whereas the average high school graduate only has a one in 35 chance of being arrested.Some studies suggest having an education can also make people more patient, and therefore less likely to be overcome by anger or violent tendencies., Having an education is typically associated with an increased ability to provide for your family. That means not only being able to help financially support your family, but also providing younger relatives with a positive role model, and inspiring them to pursue an education., Some studies suggest that having a higher education can help you live a longer life.This may be because of better working conditions that come with an education, or it could be because earning an education helped remove people from adverse domestic situations. Whatever the cause, many studies show that even earning a high school education significantly decreases the likelihood of dying young.Young men who graduate high school statistically live an average of seven years longer than male high school dropouts. Young women who graduate high school live an average of six years longer than female high school dropouts.Young men who graduate college statistically live an average of 13 years longer than male high school dropouts, and an average of six years longer than male high school graduates who do not go to college. Young women who graduate college live an average of 12 years longer than female high school dropouts, and an average of six years longer than female high school graduates who do not go to college., In addition to living a longer life, people who pursue an education tend to be happier in life.That's because having an education has been shown to make people better problem solvers who are better equipped to manage day-to-day problems.Some studies suggest that simply earning an education, regardless of subsequent income or job contentment, helps people have better mental health later in life., Some studies suggest that people who have completed an education are more likely to pursue things that offer personal fulfillment.Flow, a term used to describe meaningful and satisfying absorption in a task, is often associated with educational advancement.In other words, having an education may help you find hobbies or passions that give you a sense of fulfillment.
Many schools encourage flow, whether intentionally or not, by offering a stimulating learning environment and meaningful extracurricular activities to students who might not otherwise have those opportunities."

Look for the value of the criticism.,
Consider how specific the criticism is.,
Listen actively.,
Make the changes suggested in the criticism.,
Pause before reacting.",How to Know the Difference Between Constructive and Non Constructive Criticism2," If the criticism is truly constructive, it will be given with the intention that you or your work improves somehow. See if you can see how the criticism is geared toward that. If the criticism does not offer clear guidelines on how you can improve something, it may not be constructive. An example of the difference between valuable constructive criticism and criticism that isn’t valuable at home is:Valuable: ""I wish you would put the dishes in the dishwasher when you're done with them. When I come home and see a sink full of dishes, I feel frustrated and exhausted and I feel like that makes spending quality time together difficult."" This makes it clear why the criticism is being given, how the person can change their behavior, and what the value of that change would be.
Not valuable: ""You're such a slob! I hate how you always leave the dishes to me."" This does not offer a solution or make it clear what a change would do for either party.

, The criticism should be clearly about a specific behavior or product, not you as a person. If you’re unclear about whether the criticism is specific, ask for clarification. You may discover that the critic simply hadn’t been clear, or that the criticism isn’t in fact constructive.You can say something like, “I hear that you’re upset with my work this week. Can you tell me exactly which reports you had trouble with, and why?”
If the person has been specific but you suspect there is more that they’re not saying, you can say, “Thanks for clarifying that I need to spend more time on this week’s report. Is there anything else you’re concerned about?”

, Receiving criticism can be difficult. You may feel embarrassed, hurt, or even angry if you feel you’re being unjustly criticized. However, unless you listen carefully, you won’t know whether the criticism is actually constructive or not. Once you know that it is, you can make changes so that things will go more smoothly in the future.Paraphrase what the person critiquing you says. Repeat what you understand back to them, so that they can see that you’re taking it in. It will also help you both clarify that you understand.
Ask questions if you don’t understand. You can always say, “Can you give me an example?”
Avoid becoming defensive. You may want to argue or defend yourself. However, if the criticism is constructive, remember that the best answer is to say, “Thanks for letting me know. I’m going to do my best to make those changes in the future.”

, Constructive criticism always aims to help you grow and improve. It should also be specific. Therefore, if you make the changes to the specific situation, and do the work to improve and grow, that should satisfy the person who critiqued you.Once you’ve made the changes, check back in. You can say, “So, I made those changes. Have you noticed a difference? Do you have any further suggestions for me?”
If you make the changes but the person critiquing you still seems unsatisfied, they may simply have a personal problem with you and their criticism may not actually be constructive.

, You may feel reactionary to feedback, even if it's constructive. Before you respond to feedback, take a moment to let it sink in. That way, even if your reaction is justifiably strong, you'll have the calm and presence of mind to respond from a grounded place, rather than rashly.Count to ten and take some deep breaths before responding.
If you're receiving the criticism face to face, you may need to let yourself be silent for a moment before responding. That's okay. You're never required to respond to someone immediately. You can even say, ""Excuse me, I need to think about that for a moment.""

Use the “sandwich” method.,
Choose the right time and place.,
Communicate how you feel about the criticism.,
Make sure the criticism reflects the subject’s goals.,
Recognize the role of tone.",How to Know the Difference Between Constructive and Non Constructive Criticism3," The “sandwich” method of criticism is very popular because it offers positive feedback and constructive feedback at the same time. This makes it easier for people to receive without getting defensive or feeling badly about themselves.


Begin by mentioning positive things about the person or their work. Then mention the parts that need work, and then end on a positive note. This helps keep the receiver's self-esteem strong and keeps them interested in improving.
An example of a critique sandwich in a public speaking class could be, ""I thought your speech was really convincing and motivating. It started off a little slow, and you could probably shave off a minute from the beginning to retain audience interest. Nonetheless, you made really strong arguments and your delivery was clear and convincing. I saw the audience nodding along by the end.""

, The context in which feedback is given can have a big role in how it’s received. If you’re the person giving the criticism, as to speak to the person privately, at a time when they don’t feel too stressed or upset. If you’re the one receiving the criticism, you can ask to speak somewhere that you feel comfortable at a time that is good for you.Never give criticism in front of peers or coworkers.
You can always say, “Is this a good time?” or, “Could this wait until a better time?”

, If you feel you’re not being given constructive criticism, let the person know. You can explain the way the criticism makes you feel by using “I” statements. You don’t need to reject the criticism, simply let the person know what is difficult for you about it.At work, you can say, “When you said that I’m always late, I felt that was unfair. My timecard actually shows that I only showed up late once last week.”
You can also say something like, “I understand that my past behavior was really upsetting. However, I’d like to focus on the incident you’re talking about that happened this morning. Can we figure out a way that something like that could be avoided in the future?”

, If you’re the one giving feedback, make sure you think about what the other person’s intentions are. They’re more likely to take the feedback into account if it has to do with their personal goals. For example, if they want to get promoted to another department, let them know that the changes you’re requesting would be required for a promotion.If the person wants to be well-liked in the office, you can say, “I really want everyone here to get along and respect each other. When one person doesn’t pull their weight, that becomes difficult.”

, Tone can vary widely in constructive critique, but there is a difference between blunt and cruel. Because a constructive critic cares about improvement, they will not tear down the recipient. Ideally, constructive criticism is gentle enough to be taken in by the recipient. Blunt feedback can be okay, too. However, some people may bristle at it. Cruel feedback should always be avoided. For example, when working with a designer:


Gentle: ""This is a really good start. While it would be great in most situations, for a company presentation it's a little brightly-colored. I would recommend using a plain white, off-white, or black font with a simple background, and maybe substituting some of the clip art with photos. Still, I found the text itself highly readable, and the organization is perfect.""
Blunt: ""Your power point had too much silly clip art and contrasting colors. Give me plainer text colors and more photos. Then you'll be good to go.""
Cruel: ""That looked like it was made by a thirteen-year-old who just discovered MS Paint. Too many bright colors and wacky pictures.""

Find internships and other professional work.",How to Be a Successful College Student," Don't rely on a ""magic number"" of classes you can miss and still do well. Each missed class represents missed content and missed discussion. Some professors weigh participation into your final grade calculation. Even if attendance isn't required, however, you will make a good impression on your professor and TA if you show up to class.Only miss class if you are genuinely sick—too sick to get anything worthwhile out of the lecture.
If you need some incentive, consider the cost of each class hour. The average yearly cost of tuition at a public university is $9,139.Given a 15-week semester with 4 classes each semester, you pay over $25 per class hour for the privilege of being taught. Not going to class is basically the same as setting twenty-five bucks on fire. Would you do that?;
, Your memory is never as good as you think it is. There will probably be plenty of things taking up space in your mind while at school. Taking good notes will keep you engaged in classroom activities (lectures and discussion) and give you a good basis when studying for exams.


For classes that are organized around clear, logically ordered topics, such as history or biology, the Cornell method can help you prioritize the most important information.

, Ask questions of your instructors, give answers if they ask questions, and contribute to discussion sections. Taking an active part in the class will keep you involved with the material, and help you better understand what the instructor needs you to know.Sitting in front, or at least not in the back, will make it easier to pay attention and put you front and center for the professor to see.

, Success in college relies on you preparing outside of class, so spend time reviewing your notes and reading the textbook for each session. When you study, find a quiet space and cut off outside distractions. A good rule of thumb is to spend two hours studying for each hour you spend in class.Study groups—working with other students in your class—can be helpful, but also go off-track easily. Make sure you find a study group that reviews the material, and spends most of its time actually studying, rather than chatting.
Don't cram! Part of being a successful college student is doing more than passing tests; it's retaining the useful information for the real world. When you cram, you might remember enough to pass your exam, but chances are high that you'll forget most of it in a day or two. When you're spending tens of thousands of dollars to learn this stuff, actually remembering it for later is a smart investment.Spacing out your study sessions over a few days is the best way to make sure you remember the material later.Rather than spending a 9-hour marathon studying for a test, for example, start a few days early and study for 1-2 hours each day for 3 or 4 days in a row. If you can plan well ahead of time, it's even better to space your studying out over a period of weeks., No professor ever complained about her students finishing an assignment early. Setting aside time to complete one task will give ease your stress level, and make it more likely to complete others on time.


On occasion, you may need to stay up all night to finish an assignment. Procrastinating will only make doing so more likely, and doing work early can help you get more regular sleep.
Set yourself regular performance goals, such as writing 200 words a day on your essay or studying six math problems. These small goals seem easy to do so you're less likely to procrastinate on them. However, the accomplishments will pile up fast.
Try to avoid guilting yourself into your work. Extrinsic motivation, such as ""I ought to do this so my parents don't get mad at me,"" isn't as strong as intrinsic motivation, such as ""I want to do well on that exam so that my good grades will help me get into medical school."" Setting positive goals for yourself and reminding yourself that your work will help you achieve them can help crush procrastination.

, Your professors want you to do well in class, so feel free to ask questions about the material. Every professor has open office hours, so stop by to introduce yourself, ask about the class, or discuss your grades. This can allow them to learn more about you, your strengths and weaknesses, and provide better feedback for improving your work.Don't forget about your TAs. Many of them are quite knowledgeable about the subject as well. In a large class it will likely be them, not the professor, doing most of the grading.
It's best if you can set the foundation for communication early. If the first time your professor hears from you is the night before your midterm exam halfway through the semester, she may not take you as seriously as she would have if you'd come early and often to ask questions.

, Most students' attitude towards a class dictates their success. Believe you can learn the material and be successful, and you will increase your chances of succeeding. Don't think about how difficult things are, but how you are going to overcome those difficulties.If you're naturally shy or worried about sharing your opinions in class, remind yourself that your professor wants you to learn. In general, classrooms are a ""safe space"" for people to share their opinions, ask questions, and have discussions. Try not to worry about sounding silly if you ask a question—chances are, many of your classmates have the same question but are too afraid to ask. You can be the trailblazer!

, You won't always be able to follow your passions in the classroom. Find groups and activities that you enjoy, or maybe involve practical applications for your academic work. These events are also a great way to meet new people and make friends.

, Colleges have access to a nearly unmatched variety of cultural, intellectual, and athletic events that are available to students. Take advantage of these, and take part in the cultural life of the school, some of which you may never have the opportunity to do again.

, Unlike in high school, no one will be tracking you and your activities in college, so you will have to do that yourself. Give each event and assignment a priority based on timing, and its importance to achieving your ultimate goals. Your schedule should not just be about academic work, so include time for personal activities and interests.


One thing you may discover is that your schedule is too overloaded between class, work, social events, and other activities. Organizing your schedule can sometimes mean knowing when to cut things out.

, Studies suggest that being a freshman is incredibly stressful. It can do a number on your mental health.One of the best ways to make sure you're successful in college is to make friends with a variety of diverse people—and to commit to hanging out with them.


Making a strong social network in college is also linked to better work performance later in life.
This doesn't mean you should spend every night partying and ditching class and homework. Instead, strive for a healthy balance. You can even get your friends involved in class and other school activities, such as a sport or debate team.

, At many colleges and universities, Greek life—a system of fraternities and sororities students can join—is a major part of student experience. While being part of Greek life can have many benefits, such as socialization and support networks, it can also involve a significant time commitment. This can be particularly stressful your freshman year, when you are already adjusting to many new experiences. Some experts recommend that you wait until your sophomore year to ""rush"" or join a fraternity or sorority. That way, you'll already have a firm academic foundation., Pick courses that interest you, and make you excited to learn. This will lead you to interesting and rewarding work, rather than simply chasing easy classes.Avoid picking a major right away. Unless you are completely sure that you want to go into a particular field, there is no benefit to declaring right away. Sample classes in a variety of fields, and learn what kind of work each major requires., You want to graduate on time, so make sure you have fulfilled all requirements for the school and your major. You will need to have enough credit hours, and high enough grades. Keep an eye out for non-academic items like physical fitness requirements.


Most colleges and universities have a ""degree progress"" calculator you can find online, but if not, talk with your adviser.

, College should be difficult, and you should be prepared to deal with failure, or at least not succeeding as much as you did in high school. Your life after college will not be about the grades you got in school, but the ways you learned to deal with disappointment., Every school has one. Find out what kinds of work graduates from your school and your major go into. These places can also provide help with creating a resume, filling out job applications, and other helpful hints for what comes next., If possible, find something that will let you apply what you are learning in a work environment. You can gain valuable professional experience for afterwards.

Acquire a significant amount of relevant experience.,
Address your low GPA in your personal statement.,
Ask someone reputable for a letter of recommendation.,
Enroll in relevant courses as a non-degree seeking student.,
Take good notes when you enroll in a course.,
Study more effectively.,
Consider getting an intermediate degree.,
Study hard to get a strong GRE score.,
Be realistic about which programs you apply to.,
Apply to multiple programs.,
Try to make connections with at least one professor.,
Keep applying if you don't get in the first time.",How to Apply to Graduate Schools With a Low GPA," Even if your GPA is low, an overall impressive application portfolio could help offset those grades. One of the best ways to show your potential for graduate-level studies is by acquiring and listing a lot of experience relevant to your intended field.


Find work experience relevant to your desired field by searching for entry-level positions online.
Even volunteer or internship experience can help improve your application if it's relevant to your desired field of study.Find volunteer/internship opportunities online or by reaching out directly to an organization you'd like to work with.;
, The best way to handle any weak component of an application portfolio is to address the problem head-on. The college admissions committee will notice your low GPA, so don't think that it will slip under the radar. But if you acknowledge the low GPA, address the reasons for those poor grades, and show what you've done to improve yourself, the admissions committee may overlook it.


Highlight your accomplishments and personal/professional growth since you received the low grades that dropped your GPA.
Talk about what you did to address the problem(s) that led to your low GPA, and explain why it wouldn't be a problem in the future if you were admitted to a graduate program.
Highlight any good grades you got in courses related to the field you would study in graduate school.

, A strong letter of recommendation can help improve your chances of admission, even if your GPA is low. Think about any professors you've worked with in college and reach out to them to see if they'd be willing to write you a letter of recommendation.


Tell the professors you reach out to about anything you've done to improve your grades and your career since you took their classes.
Let your potential letter writers know why you think you'd be a strong candidate for graduate school and highlight your recent accomplishments so they can include that information in a letter of recommendation.

, If you're willing to put off your graduate program application for a year or so, you might want to consider enrolling in courses as a non-degree seeking student. This would allow you to focus on your studies and prove that you're capable of top-notch work.


You can sign up for relevant undergraduate courses at a local community college, or take one or two relevant graduate courses at a local university.
It may take more time, but taking on a small course load will improve your chances of success in those classes. You'll have more time for studying and homework, which means you'll do better than if you try to take a full course load all at once., Once you enroll in a course as a non-degree seeking student, you'll need to do your best to earn good grades. Come to class having done the reading for that day and take thorough notes to ensure that you understand the course material.Write out your notes in class by hand, then copy them into a fresh notebook at home. Writing them out a second time will help reinforce the material in your memory.
Write questions in the margins of your notebook on anything you're unclear about. Then try to find the answer in your text book, and if you can't find the answer you can ask your professor.

, Studying and good note taking are the best ways to improve your GPA. If you've done the readings, gone to class consistently, and taken good notes, you should have all the tools you need to do well on an exam.Have a dedicated time and place to study in which you won't be disturbed. Remove all distractions and turn off your cellphone while you study.
Triage your study time by dedicating the most time and effort to the material you struggle with the most. Then spend some leftover time at the end of your session reviewing the things you already know so that they're fresh in your mind.
Don't cram for tests. Manage your time and give yourself at least a couple weeks to adequately prepare for a big test.
Consider joining a study group. By studying with other students, you'll be able to help one another on any material you may have struggled with individually.

, In addition to taking courses, you may also want to consider getting a certificate or credential in a relevant field. The coursework from that intermediate degree may help raise your GPA, and you'll be able to list that certificate/credential on your application as proof of your academic potential.Find out about intermediate degrees in your area by searching online or contacting colleges/universities near you.

, Many graduate programs are willing to overlook a poor GPA if you have high GRE scores. Even ivy league universities may accept an applicant with a low GPA if the GRE scores are above average. Make sure you take the GRE, even if you're not required to for a given program, and study hard so that you score well.


Review high school math subjects like algebra and geometry, which most GRE math questions expect a basic knowledge of.Study advanced vocabulary, as the verbal section of the GRE tends to expect an advanced vocabulary knowledge.
Consider taking a GRE preparation course. If you can't afford a course, you should at least buy a GRE prep book.
Take a GRE practice exam, which is available for free online through ETS, Princeton Review, and Kaplan.Retake the GRE if you don't get good scores. Many universities look at your best GRE scores and disregard your poorer scores.

, If you have a low GPA, there's a good chance you won't get admitted to a top-notch or ivy-league university. But that doesn't mean you should give up all hope of graduate school. You may just have to apply to programs that have lower admission requirements or are more flexible on factors like your GPA.There's no shame in applying to programs with lower admission requirements. Remember that even students with a perfect 4.0 GPA often can't get into their first choice schools.
Look around at different programs and try to find a program that fits your needs while still maintaining a high academic reputation. Remember, too, that getting a degree from any graduate program is prestigious and will help advance your career.
Focus on applying to programs that evaluate your application as a whole package and not just based on grades. Check each program's admission policy or contact someone from the program to learn whether they immediately eliminate applications based on grades and test scores., Even if you have a high GPA, you should always apply to more than one program. Even students with a 4.0 GPA have a hard time getting into a graduate program simply because of how selective they can be. It's generally recommended that you apply to six or so programs to improve the odds of being accepted to one of them., It's very common for prospective students interested in working with a professor to reach out to him or her through email. This can give you an advantage when the admissions committee reviews your portfolio. Let the professor(s) you're interested in working with know about your academic and professional background, as well as your current research/scholarly interests.Be professional in your correspondence, and don't be pushy. Some professors may not want to work with you, so don't take rejection badly.
If a professor is willing to work with you, send that professor a response thanking him/her. You should also mention that professor by name in your application materials (specifically the personal statement).

, Graduate programs can be very competitive, even for applicants with perfect scores. Sometimes it takes multiple attempts at applying before you get accepted, which is perfectly normal. Don't get discouraged if you don't get accepted. Keep a copy of all your application materials, work on improving your work/education experience for another year, and try applying again with an even stronger application portfolio."

You should nod and smile to show them you are listening and try to answer any of their questions concisely and clearly. Make sure you ask any follow up questions you may have to show you are engaged and interested.

, If your interview goes well, you may be invited to do training for the RA position. Training for the position will likely be mandatory and may be scheduled during the summer, so be prepared to sacrifice your summertime to get ready for the position.The training process for RAs is often extensive and detailed. This will ensure you are well-prepared for the role and do not feel overwhelmed or stressed in your new position.

, As an RA, you will be expected to be available for students who live in the residence hall as much as possible. Issues, conflicts, and incidents could occur at any moment, and it is your job address them. You may end up spending a lot of time in your dorm room or in the residence hall, when you are not in class, so you can be available for residents. You should be prepared to make yourself available for students and be willing to engage with students on a regular basis.You may end up creating a “Where am I?” board on your door so students know where you are and how they can reach you.

, You will be expected to follow the rules of the residence hall and set a good example for the residents. You should act like a leader and a good role model by always following the rules in the dorm and following protocol. This is a major requirement of the position and you should try to act like a good role model whenever possible.Bear in mind that though you are expected to be a good role model, you are also human. Though you may try to always set a good example, you may make mistakes. You may forget a meeting with a resident or accidentally screw up some paperwork. If this happens, apologize, make amends, and move forward. Try not to put too much pressure on yourself to always be perfect, because you likely won’t be and that’s okay.

, You will also be responsible for planning social events and programs in the residence hall to create a sense of community and connection.

You may also plan events that relate to the institution directly, such as a homecoming football game party or a first week of class hang out. You will be responsible for making the events fun and engaging to students.Keep in mind it may be challenging to get students to participate in events and programming, especially if they are overwhelmed with school and other commitments. You may need to be a bit of a cheerleader and rally students to participate in events you are planning.
You should also ask your residents what they would like to as an event or program. Making events that fit their needs and wants could bring up the level attendance and the amount of fun they have.

, You may end up making friends with residents, especially if you are in the same age range and spend so much time living together. It’s natural that you may make friends and having close relationships with residents is a good thing. But you should be wary of playing favorites and showing preference for a particular resident because you are friends. Try to stay impartial and fair as an RA.Remember that if your friendship with a resident is really meaningful and real, they will respect your position as the RA. You should be friendly and open to all residents in the dorm, but you should also try to maintain a certain boundary so you do not end up showing preference to certain residents.

, Being an RA can be stressful, especially if you are also trying to balance a full course load and other commitments. You should make sure you practice self-care as an RA and try to devote some time to yourself. This may be a quick nap between classes and on-duty time as an RA. Or you may try to read alone in your room with the door closed for 10-15 minutes before bed to get some ""you"" time. Fitting self-care into your schedule will be an important part of staying calm and balanced as an RA.


You should also get support from the other staff in the residence hall. This could be other RAs on your floor or your supervisor. Reach out to them if you need help with a resident issue or if you just want to destress and blow off steam after a long day.
You should lean on the resources offered at the university as well. Get in touch with the Residence Dean if you have a resident issue you cannot handle on your own or if you feel you need some guidance as an RA.

Fill a medium sized bowl with cold water.,
Set the bundle of cilantro in a colander.,
Shake the colander with the cilantro bundle well until all of the excess water exits the colander.,
Look through the cilantro for any discolored or wilted cilantro leaves.,
Decide how much of the stems you want to keep.,
Remove however much of the stems you wish.,
Chop the bundle of cilantro in half, using the middle as a guideline.,
Store the unused cilantro.,
Decide how finely chopped you want your cilantro.,
Fold the bunch of cilantro leaves in half and place them on the cutting board.",How to Chop Cilantro," Take the bundle of cilantro and place it inside the bowl. Twirl the cilantro around in the bowl and then let it soak for about 10 minutes. This helps to gently loosen any dirt particles on the cilantro leaves.






;
, Turn on cold water and place the cilantro underneath the water in the kitchen sink. Rinse the cilantro well. Move the bundle of cilantro around while the water hits it.









By moving the cilantro around, you help to rinse away dirt particles underneath and between the leaves, Place the cilantro onto a large paper towel. Absorb any excess water from the cilantro with the paper towel. Keep the paper towel for storing the leftover cilantro.








, Pick these out of the bundle and discard appropriately (compost if available). You can simply use your hands for this. Make sure only the healthy, green leaves remain.








, Depending on your preference for the texture and taste of cilantro stems, you may want to remove some of the long stems of the cilantro. For salsas and curries, many find the cilantro stems add a pleasant amount of concentrated cilantro flavor. If your recipe doesn't specify on the inclusion of stems, use your best judgement., Place a cutting board on the counter. Place the cilantro on the cutting board and with a sharp knife, cut the long stems. These stems are located near the bottom of the cilantro bundle.









You can place a moist washcloth underneath the cutting board to help provide traction so the cutting board does not slide around when you are chopping the cilantro bundle.

, This is where the abundance of cilantro leaves are located. When you need to use a small amount of cilantro, separate the bunches in half. Avoid removing the leaves from the portion of the cilantro you are storing for later, as it will last longer intact.







, Wrap the unused bundle and the stems in the paper towel you used to dry the cilantro. Place them in a zip lock bag and place the bag in the refrigerator. This will keep it fresh for three to five days.







, Cilantro is tender, so it isn't usually necessary for it to be very finely chopped. The later in the cooking process you intend on adding the cilantro, the more finely it should be chopped. If you are using your cilantro as a garnish, chop it just enough so that it can be easily sprinkled over your food., Use a rocking motion with the knife when chopping cilantro. Go back again with the knife to ensure that all the cilantro is chopped. Regardless of how fine you want your cilantro, try to keep the chop even.

Eat only organically grown roses.,
Do not eat roses from a florist shop.,
Use scent to assess flavor.,
Remove the white heels of the petals.",How to Eat Roses1," Pesticides and insecticides can be harmful to your health. Roses absorb such products easily and it is not easy to wash these chemical additives off of roses. Stick to eating organically grown roses and make sure you check that the grower did not use any chemical-based fertilizers or additives.If possible, pick wild roses yourself to eat.;
, It is not safe to buy roses from a florist. While some greenhouses may have roses that have not been chemically treated, florists usually use chemicals or fertilizers on roses to preserve their appearance., The tastiest roses will have the strongest smells. Pink and yellow roses tend to have stronger fragrances than red varieties. In general, a rose's smell indicates its rough flavor. Use this to gauge if a rose will provide you the taste you desire., The white lower portion of all rose petals have a bitter flavor. Regardless of the type of rose you use, these should be removed. Cut off the white heel of each rose before you cook or serve your roses."

Select an appropriate grater.,
Find a small container to grate the ginger into.








,
Decide how much ginger you want to grate.,
Peel the ginger.,
Scrape the ginger alongside the grater.,
Remove any remaining ginger pieces from the bottom of the grater.








",How to Grate Ginger,"









While you may be able to accomplish the task of grating ginger with a standard box grater, you will likely find that clean-up can be a hassle. Many people who use standard graters report that the ginger becomes stuck within the perforations. Think about investing in a grater specifically designed to handle ginger gratings. Porcelain ginger graters can be purchased, along with microplane graters that are designed to be used with ginger.;
,,









You can grate the entire piece of ginger if you want to, but for most dishes, you'll only need a small piece of the ginger root to adequately season a meal. If you only need to grate a small piece of ginger, cut off a portion from rest of the root.

,









Use a knife or the back of a spoon to dislodge the woody peel from the ginger. Though it can be tempting to peel the ginger like a potato, by moving the knife towards you, it isn't advisable to do this. In addition to being dangerous, you can also take off more peel than is necessary. Your goal should be to peel off just enough outer layer to expose the edible ginger underneath.

, Make sure that the ginger is traveling against the grater's grain. Allow the gratings to fall into the container.

Separate the leaves from the rest of the plant.,
Wash the leaves thoroughly.,
Chop or tear the leaves into bite-sized pieces.",How to Eat Plantain Leaves1," Plantain plants have many different parts, including the leaves, roots, tough, fibrous shoots and flowering seed stalks. For most recipes, it will be easiest to work with just the leaves. Pull the leaves gently from their stems and set them aside in a shallow bowl or colander for rinsing.Throw out any slimy, mottled or discolored leaves you happen to come across while you’re sorting—these can spoil the whole bunch.If you want, you can hold onto the shoots and seeds and use them for other culinary projects.;
, Run the leaves under a stream of cool water while tossing them lightly by hand. This will help remove any loose dirt or debris clinging to them. For a more thorough cleaning, let the leaves soak at the bottom of a bowl of water for a minute or two.Swishing the leaves in a mixture of water and apple cider vinegar can also help kill any lingering bacteria.
To dry the leaves, shake off the excess water, then sandwich them between layers of folded paper towels., Plantain leaves can grow quite large, so you’ll often have to cut them to make them more manageable. Stack the leaves on top of one another and slice them into halves or quarters, or simply tear them to the desired size by hand. The exact size of the leaves will depend largely on the recipe you plan to use them in.Young plantains bear small, tender leaves that can be eaten whole.You can also use a mandoline or a pair of herb scissors to cut the leaves into strips for soups, slaws and garnishes.

Blanch the leaves to soften them.,
Sauté plantains on the stovetop.,
Roast the leaves in the oven.",How to Eat Plantain Leaves2," Place the plantain leaves in a wire strainer and lower them into a pot of boiling water. Heat the leaves for 3-5 minutes, then remove them and plunge them into a bath of cold water to stop the cooking process. After a brief blanching, the plantains should have a perfectly balanced texture.Broadleaf plantain (as well as the leaves of more mature plants) is known to be slightly tougher, and may need to be boiled for an additional minute or two.Avoid overcooking greens. This tends to make them mushy and robs them of both their flavor and nutritional value.

, Another simple way to prepare the leafy green is to lightly pan fry it. Heat a nonstick skillet with butter or olive oil, add the plantain leaves and toss them with minced garlic, shallots or other aromatics until they just begin to wilt. Season with salt and pepper and dig in.Sautéd plantain leaves can be cooked up as a simple side dish with minimal time or labor.
Fresh greens shrink quite a bit when exposed to heat, so you may need to use more leaves in order to produce a full serving.

, Lay out the leaves on a cookie sheet and brush them with a light coating of olive or canola oil. Bake for 6-8 minutes at 350°F (176°C). When the plantains come out of the oven, they’ll be crisp and paper-thin, making them easier to crumble.Season roasted plantain leaves with sea salt, black pepper and garlic or onion powder and eat them like chips.You can also dehydrate the leaves on their own, then grind them up and use them to make teas or mixes for green smoothies.

Brew plantain tea.",How to Eat Plantain Leaves3," Use the leaves to supplement romaine, spinach, kale and other fresh greens. Top with feta cheese, seasonal root veggies or any of your other favorite salad additives. Left uncooked, plantains have a slightly sweet, earthy flavor similar to artichokes and mild varieties of mushrooms.Most people prefer to eat plantains raw because of their high natural nutrient content.Plantains have a subtle taste that pairs just as well with traditional savory ingredients like cheese, bacon and herbed croutons as it does with sweeter items like candied nuts and dried cranberries., Plantain leaves can make an excellent substitute in casseroles, stir fries, sandwiches and hors d'oeuvres. Just prepare and cook the greens the same way you normally would. Since they’re from a heartier variety of plant, they even retain more of their satisfying crunch.Offer mini plantain quiches or plantain and artichoke dip for the next get-together you host.Because they grow and spread so quickly, plantains are more readily available and easier to harvest in large amounts than spinach.

, For a unique organic spin on the Mediterranean staple, brown ground beef or lamb in a pan, then combine with rice, herbs and sweet and savory spices.

Choose your grinder.,
Save your grinder for spices only.,
Store the grinder properly.,
Cool spices before grinding.,
Pulse your spices.,
Store unused ground spices.",How to Use a Coffee Grinder for Spices,"


Not all coffee bean grinders are equal when it comes to grinding spices. Many spices are much smaller than the average coffee bean, and you're likely to be grinding fewer spices than beans at any given time. So choose a small coffee grinder with a 1/2 to 1 cup capacity; any larger and you risk being unable to grind the spices. Also look for a grinder that has a sharp blade that is positioned close to the bottom of the grinder. When grinding hard spices like peppercorns you need a sharp blade. Seeds like celery seed or poppy seeds are so tiny and fine that a blade close to the bottom of the grinder will grind them nicely. If the blade is too high off the bottom of the grinder it won't reach the tiny seeds at the bottom.;
,


Do not use a coffee grinder for coffee beans and spices. The coffee bean oil will permeate the interior of the coffee grinder and taint all your spices with a coffee flavor. Conversely, using a grinder for spices and then coffee may alter the aroma of your coffee.

,


Spices are aromatic and flavorful. In order to prevent the contamination of your spices from previous grindings, always dust out the grinder when finished and store it without a lid. Removing any residual spices will help the grinder air out, and the air flow will dry out any oils that have been left behind by the grinder.

,


If you plan on roasting your spices prior to grinding them, allow them to cool so that they don't melt or warp the interior of the grinder. Cooling them will also make them safer to handle.

,


Spices lose their flavor quickly if there is heat applied to them. When you're grinding your spices only pulse the grinder rather than holding down the button for a consistent grind. Pulsing the grinder will keep the blade from overheating and leaching flavor from your spices. A consistent grind will heat the blade quickly and reduce the flavor of your freshly ground spices.

,


Unused ground spices can be stored in your pantry for several weeks if they're in an airtight container. Keeping them away from the oven and out of direct sunlight will help preserve their flavor. The longer you keep them, however, the less flavorful they will be.

Choose the freshest ginger.",How to Store Ginger1," If you want your ginger to last as long as possible, then you have to pick out the freshest ginger root and use it shortly after purchasing. To find the freshest ginger, look for ginger with a fresh and spicy fragrance and a nice smooth skin. The rhizomes of the ginger should feel heavy and firm in your hands. Avoid any ginger that's wrinkled or feels a bit soft, or you'll be eating ginger that's already on the decline.


Avoid any ginger that is wet, moist, or moldy.
Decide whether to store the ginger in the freezer or refrigerator. If you know you'll be using the ginger again soon, then you should just store it in the refrigerator to make it easy to use, peel, or mince the ginger in the future. Ginger can last in the refrigerator for up to three weeks, so if you know you won't be using it before then, then you should store it in the freezer.
You can also mix and match. If you know you'll be using a small chunk of the ginger soon, then you can cut off a chunk and refrigerate it and then freeze the rest of the ginger for use in the more distant future.;

Be aware that herbs change flavour when dried.,
Account for the change in strength in dried herbs.,
Use dried herbs where they are most effective.",How to Replace Fresh Herbs With Dried Herbs," This is due principally to the evaporation of the essential oils when the herb dries, altering the flavour quite markedly. Nevertheless, this alteration can be ideal given the right cooking medium, amount used and properly matching the ingredients. And realistically, many herbal mixes only come in dried form, so using these mixtures can be a very important part of certain cuisines, such as Asian or Italian.;
, Dried herbs are much stronger than fresh herbs. Many cooks recommend using one-third to a half the amount of dried herb to fresh herb. As a general rule for the most commonly used kitchen herbs, it is considered accurate to substitute one teaspoon dried for every tablespoon fresh. Know that the test is in the tasting because even half or a third the amount might be overwhelming in the dried form. It is always best to add less and top up if the taste is not strong enough.

, Dried herbs work really well in dishes that are sautéed. When sautéed, the dried herbs have sufficient opportunity to release their flavours into the dish.

Store freshly peeled ginger submerged in spirits.",How to Store Ginger2," To store ginger in a zipper storage bag, simply take the unpeeled ginger and place it in a zipper bag, taking care to push all of the air out of the bag. Place it in the veggie crisper in your fridge and have it stay crisp and fresh for several weeks. When compared to other methods, such as storing the ginger in a paper bag or wrapping it with a paper towel and then placing it in the bag, this method came up lasting the longest by quite a few weeks.If the ginger is already peeled, this method will work too, but it won't last as long as it would with the peel on.

, Store a chunk of unpeeled ginger by carefully wrapping it in a paper towel until there's no air holes or uncovered parts and then place it in a paper bag. Take care to push all of the air out of the paper bag before you seal it. Place the ginger in the vegetable crisper of your refrigerator and store it for a few weeks.

, If you're in a pinch for time, you can just place the ginger in a paper bag and put the bag in the vegetable crisper of your fridge. The ginger won't last as long as it will using the other methods, but this is a quick and easy trick to use if you know you'll be eating the ginger within a week. This is a solid method for quickly storing herbs such as dill or cilantro as well.

, Just place the freshly peeled ginger in a jar or sealable container and submerge them a spirit or acidic liquid. The most commonly used liquids are: vodka, dry sherry, sake, rice wine, rice vinegar, and fresh lime juice. Vodka and sherry are the most popularly used spirits, and vodka has been shown to have the longest-lasting results while altering the flavor of the ginger the least.Though this is a solid storage method, be aware that the liquid will change the flavor of the ginger a bit -- or a lot.

Cut the peeled ginger in medallions.",How to Store Ginger3," Carefully take a sheet of plastic wrap and wrap it around the unpeeled ginger once or twice until it's completely covered by the plastic wrap. Then, place the ginger in a zipper storage bag, taking care to push out any extra air. Place the zipper bag in the freezer and enjoy the ginger for the next few months. Grating whole, frozen ginger root with a cheese grater is very easy, by the way .

, First, peel the ginger and mince it finely. Then, spread or scoop the ginger on a tray that is lined with parchment, using portions that are teaspoon or tablespoon sized. Place the tray in the freezer until the ginger is completely frozen and then transfer it to an airtight container like Tupperware or a jar with a tight lid. Place it in the freezer and enjoy this minced ginger for up to six months., Chop up ginger into the size you'd like it to be for your future meals, whether it's into thumb-sized pieces or matchstick-sized pieces. You can mix and match, cutting up the ginger into any size you like while keeping on the skin. Then, store the ginger in an airtight container and place it in the fridge., If you know you'll cook the ginger in medallions, you can peel it, cut it up into a medallion shape, and then place it a glass bowl or another freezer-friendly open container. Place it in the freezer until the ginger is completely frozen, turning over the ginger after an hour to speed up the process if you like. Then, place the ginger in an airtight container and seal it.

In date
Ground finely and evenly
Shiny in colour and consistent, Paprika is available in various styles, including smoked. The plain, hot and sweet varieties are Hungarian and the smoked version is Spanish.



Hungarian regular paprika - ranging from red to yellow in colour, see ""Tips"" for explanation; usually a very mild flavour with slightly bitter overtones.

Hungarian sweet paprika - sweet, with slight bitterness, described by some as ""pleasant"". It is described by BBC Food as ""warm"", with the suggestion to obtain the variety labelled ""noble sweet"".Hungarian hot paprika - a bearable kick that does not increase in heat; no bitterness.

Spanish paprika - this is milder than Hungarian paprika and comes in sweet (dulce), bittersweet (agridulce) and hot (picante)Spanish smoked paprika:
Sweet - smoky, low level of bitterness and balanced sweetness
Spanish bittersweet
Spanish hot (picante) - smoky and less hot than Hungarian hot paprika

Add an acid to trick the tongue.,
Dilute the liquid.,
Add starch.,
Add sugar.,
Soak bread.,
Pour off the salty liquid.,
Make more soup.,
Salt after you heat the soup.,
Be patient adding seasoning.,
Remember some of the ingredients are likely to contain salt.,
Use low sodium broth.,
Let people season their own soup.",How to Fix Salty Soup," Often salty soups don't have too much salt, but just need the flavors to be balanced. Try adding an acid such as lemon juice, vinegar or wine which will obscure the salty taste.;
, For a quick and easy fix add some more water, juices or stock gradually until the salt concentration is reduced. You can try this for thick soups, but it works best for brothy soups.


Make sure the liquid you are diluting the soup with isn't what made it salty in the first place!

, Foods like potatoes, rice, noodles and pasta will absorb the salt and help thicken the soup, especially if you have diluted the liquid.


Some people even add a potato just for it to absorb the salt and then take it out. If you follow this route, cut the potato into thin slices for maximum absorbing efficiency.

, Add a few teaspoons of sugar or another ingredient that is sweet. This will help take the edge off the saltiness.

, Remove the crust from the bread, tear it up and float it on the top. When the bread soaks the water it will simultaneously absorb the salt. This works best for thick soups.

, If all else fails find something clean to absorb the salty liquid. Clean paper towels work well to help soak up the excess liquid.

, If you can't reduce the saltiness or prefer to avoid messing around, add some more ingredients and liquid. Obviously, don't add more salt.

, Often people will season a soup and then boil in. This is a disaster waiting to happen because as it cooks the water will evaporate leaving you with a salty soup.

, Don't rush in and add all the salt at one time. Good chefs will add salt a little at a time, tasting in between, to get it just right.


If the soup still needs a flavor kick, add some acid such as lemon juice or vinegar.

, Too much salt can taste overwhelming, and it isn't healthy to consume a lot of sodium on a regular basis. If the soup already has bacon, ham or other salty ingredients it might not need any salt at all.

, It is normal for stock to taste bland without salt, but often companies add salt to their stock so it tastes good on its own.


When making stock, don't add salt because you can always do this later. If buying stock, look out for one with low sodium.
It is especially important to use a stock containing low sodium when the ingredients already have high amounts of salt.

, People often vary in their preferences for saltiness, especially in soups where you can't easily remove the salt. So hold off on adding extra seasoning, and let people add their own at the table.

In many cases, you can substitute some or all of these spices for the others.You can substitute ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of ground nutmeg or allspice for every 1 teaspoon (3 g) ground cinnamon.
You can replace allspice with an equal amount of cinnamon, or a dash of ground nutmeg or cloves for every 1 teaspoon (2 g).
You can substitute an equal amount of ground cinnamon, ginger, or mace for nutmeg.
You can replace mace with an equal amount of ground allspice, cinnamon, ginger, or nutmeg.

You can replace ground cloves with an equal amount of ground allspice, cinnamon, or nutmeg.
You can substitute an equal amount of ground cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, or mace for ground ginger.;
, If a recipe calls for fresh grated ginger root, ground ginger is an ideal substitute. However, because ground spices are more potent than their fresh counterparts, you don’t need as much ground ginger.Replace every 1 teaspoon (2 g) of grated fresh ginger with ¼ teaspoon (1 g) ground ginger.

, Ground cardamom has an herbal, citrusy taste, but it also has strong hint of spice. That makes ground ginger an ideal substitute for it in recipes.You can replace the ground cardamon in a recipe with an equal amount of ground ginger.

, Anise seed has a subtle licorice flavor. Though fennel seed is slightly sweeter than anise, it also has a licorice-y flavor, so it is a good replacement in recipes.You can swap an equal amount of fennel seed for anise seed in dishes.
The replacement also works in the reverse -- substitute anise seed for fennel seed while cooking.
You can also use a few drops of anise extract to substitute for 1 teaspoon (2 g) of anise seed.

, Saffron powder has a subtle floral, almost honey-like flavor, but is often used in recipes to give the dish a yellow color. Ground turmeric has a similar taste and can impart the same yellow color so it’s an ideal replacement for saffron powder.You can substitute a dash of turmeric for 1 teaspoon (2 g) of saffron powder.

, Cayenne pepper can add major heat to a dish. Red chili powder offers a similar heat and red color, so it’s an ideal substitute for cayenne. You can also swap paprika for cayenne pepper, though paprika isn’t quite as hot.You can substitute an equal amount of red chili powder for the cayenne pepper.
Replace every teaspoon (2 g) of cayenne pepper with 2 teaspoons (4 g) of paprika.

, Paprika doesn’t really provide heat or spiciness to a dish, but it does offer a delicious smokiness. You can substitute ancho or chipotle powder for paprika. You can also swap a pinch of cayenne pepper for paprika.You can use an equal amount of ancho or chipotle powder for the paprika.
Add a pinch of cayenne pepper for every tablespoon (7 g) of paprika.

, Chili powder is often used in Mexican food and chili recipes to add heat and spiciness. It is actually a blend of several different dried, ground chilies and other spices. To replace it, use a combination of bottled red pepper sauce, dried oregano, and ground cumin.For every tablespoon (8 g) of chili powder, use a dash of red pepper sauce, 1 ½ teaspoons (1 ½ g) og dried oregano, and 1 ½ teaspoon (4 g) og ground cumin.

, Poultry seasoning is often used to give roasted chickens, turkeys, and other poultry flavor. It is actually a blend of several spices, so mix dried sage with a combination of dried thyme, marjoram, black pepper, and rosemary as a substitute.For every 1 teaspoon (1 ½ g) of poultry seasoning, mix ¾ teaspoon (1 g) dried sage with ¼ teaspoon (½ g) blend of dried thyme, marjoram, black pepper, and/or rosemary.

, When you’re making a pumpkin pie or other pumpkin-flavored desserts, pumpkin pie spice helps add just the right flavor. It is a blend of several different spices, so substitute a mix of ground cinnamon, ginger, allspice, and nutmeg for pumpkin pie spice.For every 1 teaspoon (½ g) of pumpkin pie seasoning, combine ½ teaspoon (1 g) of ground cinnamon with ¼ teaspoon (½ g) ground of ginger, ¼ teaspoon (½ g) ground of allspice, and ⅛ teaspoon (¼ g) of ground nutmeg.

, Curry powder is a spice used to flavor rice, soups, sauces, and other dishes in South Asian cooking. Combine ground turmeric, ginger, black pepper, coriander, cumin, and chili powder to substitute for it in recipes.Mix equal amounts of ground turmeric, ginger, black pepper, coriander, cumin, and chili powder to create the amount needed to substitute for the curry powder.

, Apple pie spice is used not only to flavor pies, but apple turnovers, crisps, and dumplings. It is a blend of several different spices, so mix ground cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and cloves or ginger to substitute for it.For every 1 teaspoon (½ g) of apple pie spice, combine ½ (1 g) of ground cinnamon with ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of ground nutmeg, ⅛ teaspoon (¼ g) of ground allspice, and a dash of ground cloves or ground ginger.

, Italian seasoning can add the perfect flavor to pasta sauces, pizzas, and other Italian dishes. It features a blend of several spices, so mix any combination of dried basil, oregano, rosemary, and/or crushed red pepper to substitute for it in a recipe.Combine equal amounts of dried basil, oregano, rosemary, and/or crushed red pepper to replace the amount of Italian seasoning that you need.

, When you’re making spice substitutions as you cook, it’s best to start with a small amount of the replacement to ensure that you’re happy with the flavor. For the best results, start with just half the amount of the replacement that the recipes calls for with the original and add more to get the flavor that you want.For example, if a recipe calls for a teaspoon (2 g) of cardamom, add ½ teaspoon (1 g) of ginger to start with. Only mix in more if you aren’t happy with the flavor.

, Spices can lose their flavor and pungency within 1 to 3 years. Because you usually only use a small amount each time you cook, you may not go through a large bottle before the spice loses its flavor. That’s why it’s best to buy spices in small jars so you know that they’re always fresh.Buying your spices in small batches can also help you save money.

, To ensure that your spices are always fresh when you use them, it’s important to know how old they are. When you purchase the spices, write down the date on the bottle or container so you easily verify how old they are.While some spices will be good for 2 to 3 years, it’s best to replace your spices once a year to ensure that they’re fresh.

, Spices can degrade more quickly if they’re exposed to heat and humidity. Store yours in a cold, dry spot, such as inside a cabinet or pantry, so they stay fresh for as long as possible.Exposure to air is also harmful to spices, so keep them in airtight containers.
Light can also degrade spices, so make sure to keep them in a dark location.
Don’t keep your spices in a cabinet over the stove because the heat may degrade them.

, Before you mix spices into your dishes, it’s a good idea to examine them to ensure that they’re fresh. Fresh spices typically have a bright color and a strong aroma. If the color or scent seems off, the spice likely has lost its flavor."

Determine when to defrost your food in the refrigerator.,
Verify that the temperature of your refrigerator is set to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.44 degrees Celsius).,
Place your frozen food on a plate or dish to prevent leaks.,
Prepare your food shortly after it has been defrosted.",How to Defrost Food1," Most items will usually defrost within up to 24 hours; however, large items such as frozen turkeys and chickens may take several days to defrost.


Place frozen items that weigh approximately 1 lb. (0.45 kg) into the refrigerator the day before you plan to cook them.
Calculate the amount of days needed to defrost large items such as hams or turkeys, allowing 24 hours for every 5 lbs. (2.26 kg). For example, to defrost a turkey that weighs 16 lbs. (7.25 kg), place the turkey in the refrigerator at least 3 days prior to cooking it.;
, Your food will take longer to defrost if the temperature of your refrigerator is several degrees lower.

, Any juice that drips from your defrosted food onto other food in your refrigerator may contaminate those foods.

, Some foods must be prepared and eaten immediately to prevent bacteria growth; however, you may refreeze the food, as long as it is placed in the freezer within the time frame in which you should have eaten it.


Eat ground meats, seafood, and poultry within 1 and 2 days after they have been defrosted.
Eat lamb, pork, beef, steak, roast, and all other types of meats within 3 and 5 days after they have been defrosted.

",How to Dry Chives1," Rinse them under cold running water and remove any dead or withered chives. Pat them dry with a clean towel or kitchen towel until all moisture is removed.;
, Gather the chives into loose bundles that you can easily hold in one hand. Secure the stems with kitchen twine or a rubber band, ensuring that they stay together securely without crushing them.Trim off the excess bottom and top portions of any stems that stick out if you want the bundles to look even.
If you are cutting the chives from a garden, trim them early in the morning after the dew has dried when they are the healthiest and full of flavor.

, Cut small holes or slits in the sides of the small paper bags to allow airflow. Gather the top of the bag together with string and hang the chives inside the bag from the top.The bag prevents dust from gathering on the chives and keeps sunlight from bleaching out their green color.

, Leave them for approximately two weeks until they are brittle to the touch.


Check the chives every few days to ensure that no mold has developed on them.

, Remove the chives from the bags and bundles and place them on parchment paper or a cutting board. Gently crumble the chives with your hands or chop them with a knife into small pieces.

Choose the refrigerator for slow, even defrosting.,
Place the frozen meat on a plate.,
Refrigerate the frozen meat.,
Cook the meat or refreeze it.",How to Defrost Meat1," The refrigerator method is easy and safe, requiring very little hands-on time. Additionally, you don’t have to worry about cooking thinner portions of the food or overheating the meat. However, it can take a long time for food to thaw, especially larger meats like a turkey or a pork roast.


If you don’t have at least 24 hours to wait for the meat to defrost, choose a faster method.;
, Choose a large, sturdy plate that is big enough to hold all of the meat. The plate will prevent any moisture from falling from the thawing meat into your refrigerator.If the cut of meat is very large, such as a turkey or roast, place it on a large pan.


Leave on any plastic packaging. This will protect the meat from falling food or debris in your refrigerator.

, Place the plate of frozen meat in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours. For larger cuts of meat, allow 24 hours for every 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms) of meat.After the first 24 hours, check the meat periodically to see if it’s thawed.


Poke the meat through the plastic or turn it over to see whether or not it’s done thawing.
Wash your hands before and after touching the frozen meat to avoid food contamination.

, Since refrigerator defrosting is such a gentle method, you don’t need to cook the meat right away. Instead, you can refreeze it for later use or cook it at a later date. For example:


Poultry, fish, and ground meat can be kept in the refrigerator for an additional 1-2 days.
Beef, pork, lamb, or veal will keep for another 3-5 days in the refrigerator."
"
Place your frozen food in a waterproof and airtight plastic bag.,
Submerge the plastic bag completely in a tub or sink of cold water.,
Wait for your food to defrost.,
Cook the defrosted food immediately.",How to Defrost Food2," This will prevent the tissue of your food from absorbing water, which may lower its quality; in addition to preventing existing bacteria in the water from contaminating your food.

,


Replace the water every 30 minutes with fresh, cold water to keep the temperature of the water consistently cold.

, Small food items that weigh approximately 1 lb. (0.45 kg) will take up to 1 hour to defrost; whereas larger items that weigh several pounds need 30 minutes of defrosting time for every pound. For example, if you are defrosting a 4 lb. (1.81 kg) beef roast, it will need to remain in cold water for at least 2 hours prior to cooking.

, If you do not plan on eating the food right away, refreeze the food only after it has been cooked.

,
Thaw your food using the defrost setting on your microwave.,
Prepare your food immediately after defrosting it in the microwave.",How to Defrost Food3,", If your microwave does not have a designated defrost mode, set the power to 50 percent. This will prevent the outside layers of your food from cooking while the remainder of your food is still frozen.


Refer to your microwave's manual or consult with the manufacturer to determine how long to defrost your food in the microwave before you can prepare it.

, If you do not cook or eat the food immediately, it will be more susceptible to bacterial growth.

Choose the cold water method.,
Place the meat in a re-sealable bag.,
Submerge the bag in bowl of cold water.,
Cook the thawed meat immediately.",How to Defrost Meat2," This method of defrosting is much faster than the refrigerator. Five pounds of meat (2.3 kilograms) or less can be defrosted within an hour, while larger cuts can take 2-3 hours. Additionally, you won’t risk cooking thinner parts of the meat like you would in a microwave. However, once defrosted, the food has to be cooked immediately.

, The re-sealable bag will protect the meat from any bacteria in the air or the water.First, choose a large, freezer-grade re-sealable bag. Next, seal the meat inside, pressing the bag to remove most of the air.


You don’t have to remove any plastic packaging before sealing the meat into the re-sealable bag.

, Choose a large bowl and place it in your sink. Fill the bowl with cold tap water. Next, place the re-sealable bag of meat into the water, submerging it completely. Let the meat sit in the water until it’s completely thaw. Every thirty minutes, dump out the water and refill it to keep the water fresh and cold.


One or two pounds of meat (0.5 kilograms) can take 15-30 minutes.
Larger pieces of meat can take 2-3 hours., Even though the meat has been submerged in cold water, it has been exposed to warmer temperatures. Therefore, the meat must be cooked immediately after defrosting. If you want to refreeze the food, you must cook it first."

Check the food periodically for “hot spots.” Every minute or so, pause the microwave and check on your meat.,
Cook the meat immediately.",How to Defrost Meat3," This quick method works best with smaller pieces of evenly cut meat. The microwave will defrost the meat in a matter of minutes. However, this method can also partially cook the meat or make it tough, affecting the quality of the dish.The thawed food must be cooked immediately after thawing. If you can’t cook it immediately, wait to thaw it until you need it.

, First, remove any plastic packaging from the meat. This packaging will retain moisture that will “boil” the outside of the meat.Next, place the meat on a large, microwave safe plate. If there are thinner portions of meat, place them near the center of the plate to stop them from cooking in the microwave.Microwave safe plates include ceramic and glass plates that don’t have any metal embellishments.
Some frozen meats come on Styrofoam trays. These trays are not microwave safe and should be discarded.

, Each brand of microwave is slightly different. However, most brands have a special “defrost” button. To thaw the meat, place the meat in the microwave and press the “defrost” button. Then, your microwave will ask you to enter the weight of the meat. This measurement will be used to determine the thawing time for the meat.


Before using the “defrost” feature, read your manufacturer manual.

, Gently touch the sides to see if they’re warm. If they are, let the meat cool for a minute or so before continuing to defrost the meat. Once the microwave has finished defrosting the food, remove it from the microwave.Use a hand towel to remove the plate from the microwave to avoid burning your hand.
Wash your hands before and after touching raw meat to avoid food contamination.

, When you use a microwave to thaw frozen meat, you expose the meat to warm temperatures that can encourage the growth of bacteria. Therefore, the meat must be cooked immediately to avoid any food contamination.If you want to refreeze the meat, you must cook it first.

Secure your cutting board.,
Peel the sweet potato (optional).,
Cut the sweet potato in half.,
Cut each sweet potato half into slices.,
Cut the slices into strips.,
Turn the strips and cut them into cubes.",How to Cube Sweet Potatoes1," Take a large chef's knife and check to see if the blade is sharp. Use a honing steel to slightly bend the blade back into realignment. Or you can use an electric or mechanical knife sharpener to smooth your blade until it's sharp again.

To tell if your knife is dull, hold a large piece of paper and slice directly through it. Ensure that the knife is pointing away from you as you slice. If the knife can't slice through the paper, you need to sharpen it.;
, Keep your cutting board from sliding around as you cube the sweet potatoes. Wet a small kitchen cloth or towel and wring it out so it's completely damp. Lay this on your work surface and place the cutting board directly on the cloth. It will hold your cutting board in place.

Avoid using glass cutting boards which can damage your knives. They're also more likely to slip around as you cut.

, If you plan on steaming or simmering the cubed sweet potato, you may want to peel it before cubing it. Otherwise, the skin will just add a little texture. Use a vegetable peeler to slice away the sweet potato skins.Keep in mind that the sweet potato may become slippery and harder to handle once you've peeled it.

, Lay the sweet potato on the cutting board and slice it in half (across the round center of the sweet potato). You should now have two equal halves of sweet potato, each with a flat end., Set each sweet potato half on the cutting board so it's standing up on the flat end. This will create a sturdy base for cutting the sweet potato. Take your sharp knife and slice down to create even slices. The slices should be as wide as you'd like the cubes to end up being. Do this for the other sweet potato half as well., Lay the slices down on their sides so the flat part is resting on the cutting board. Cut the slices into even strips. The strips should be as thick as you'd like the cubes to end up being., Turn the strips of sweet potato about 90 degrees and cut them into more strips. This will create cubes. Continue to cut the sweet potato strips until you've cubed all of them."

, This can take a few minutes. Check by taking a spoonful of the pudding and dropping it back into the container. If it makes no sound or a soft sound, it’s ready., Put in a little bit at a time, mixing in well, to see how much sweetener you prefer. If your container has a lid, shake the pudding to mix it., Overnight is a safe bet, to get the proper thickness. If it’s not thick enough after a night, drain off some liquid or add in more chia by the teaspoonful., Add the Cinnamon, Chocolate, or Ginger (powder or juice) flavors. Slowly pour the flavors in while mixing. If there are lumps, take them out and mash them with the bottom of your spoon.

Add a little at a time, mix well, then taste. Some people like it spicy, so experiment!, Leave in the fridge overnight. This is for softening the flakes, making them blend into the pudding better., Mix well. If you feel the pudding is too thick, you can add the milk used to soak the coconut., Cut the banana into thin ¼ inch rounds. The pineapple should be cut into small cubes the size of your thumbnail.

You can add juice from the pineapple, usually canned in juice (if you used it) to add more flavor. Stir in a little at a time.
Do not soak kiwi or pineapple in the pudding for too long; it might turn out mushy or leach juices.

, Add a sprinkle of extra coconut on top if you like. Eat while thinking of a warm beach, if you want., Leave in the fridge overnight. This will plump up the raisins and make them juicy. The cashews will soften and be easier to eat., Add the solid pieces of cashew and raisin, without the milk they soaked in. This way, you can see if the pudding is too thick later on.

Place unripe avocados in a paper bag.,
Add a ripening agent.,
Give the avocados a couple days to ripen.,
Know when an avocado is ripe.",How to Ripen and Store Avocados1," Avocados will naturally ripen on their own at room temperature on the counter. You can also speed up the ripening process so the avocados will be ready to use in two to three days.To hasten the ripening, put the avocados into a paper bag and fold the top of the bag over on itself twice.


Avocados naturally create something called ethylene gas, which makes fruit ripen faster. When the avocados are in a paper bag, the ethylene gas gets trapped, and this helps to ripen the fruit faster than if the gas escaped into the air.;
, There are other fruits that produce ethylene gas, and you can help speed up the ripening process even more by adding other ethylene-producing fruits to the paper bag with the avocado. Other fruits to consider include:Red or golden delicious apples
Kiwi
Banana

, Place the avocados somewhere warm, like on the counter near a sunny window. Check them after two days to determine if they're ripe. If they still need more time, close the bag again and leave the avocado for another day.


Non-bagged avocados generally need four to seven days to ripen, but bagged avocados may be ready in two to three.Ripening an avocado in a bag won’t affect the flavor, and will result in a delicious and buttery fruit.

, There are two main indications that an avocado is ripe, and they are color and texture. First, check the color. The skin of a ripe avocado will turn a deep greenish-black. Next, give the fruit a gentle squeeze. A ripe avocado will yield to gentle pressure.


An unripe avocado will have light or dark green skin, and will feel firm when squeezed.
An overripe avocado will be dark black, look slightly shrunken, and will feel mushy when squeezed.When you cut into an overripe avocado, the flesh will have turned brown in many spots.

"
"
Preheat your oven.,
Wrap the avocado in foil.,
Bake the avocado.,
Remove the foil before using.",How to Ripen and Store Avocados2," There are times when you'll need a ripe avocado immediately and simply don’t have one. In those cases, you can heat the avocado in the oven to help soften them. Preheat the oven to 200 F (93 C).


The oven is superior to the microwave for ripening avocados rapidly. The microwave can leave the avocado mushy and tasteless.An avocado that’s softened in the oven won’t have the same buttery flavor that a truly ripe avocado does, but it will be softer and easier to peel, cut, and mash., Baking the avocado in the oven will help it to produce ethylene, which is a gas produced by many plants that promotes ripening. To trap that gas and help the avocado soften, wrap the avocado in aluminum foil.Instead of using foil, you can also place the avocado in a baking dish with a tight-fitting lid. This is particularly useful if you're trying to soften multiple avocados.

, Place the avocado in the oven and bake it for an hour. Any less and the avocado won’t be soft enough to pass as ripe. When the hour is up, remove the avocado from the oven. Give it a gentle squeeze through the foil to test for softness. Return the avocado to the oven for 10-minute increments if it still feels firm.


When the avocado is soft and gives to gentle pressure, set it aside and let it cool in the foil.

, Once the avocado has cooled to the touch, about 30 minutes, remove the foil. Now that the avocado is soft, you can cut it, mash it, or add it to any of your favorite dishes."

Keep unripe avocados on the counter.,
Refrigerate ripe avocados.,
Prevent cut avocados from turning brown.,
Freeze avocados for long-term storage.",How to Ripen and Store Avocados3," Avocados don’t ripen until they’ve been picked, so you can store unripe avocados at room temperature on your counter for up to seven days while they ripen.


Place unripe avocados in a fruit bowl or basket and store them at room temperature. You can either leave them on the counter or put them away in a pantry.Start checking for ripeness after three or four days.

, Ripe avocados should be transferred to the refrigerator if they aren't being used immediately. Refrigeration will slow the ripening process. Ripe avocados can be stored at cool temperatures for between three and five days.


Refrigerated avocados should be stored in a plastic bag., As soon as you cut into an avocado, regardless of whether it’s ripe or not, the green flesh inside will begin to turn brown. This happens with many fruits, and it’s a result of being exposed to oxygen. To help slow the process, store the avocado in the refrigerator for one to two days. You can further slow the process by:Storing the avocado in an air-tight container with some chopped onion.
Wrapping the avocado tightly with plastic wrap, with the wrap touching the flesh.
Sprinkling cut or mashed avocado with an acidic agent, such as lemon or lime juice, tomato juice, orange juice, or vinegar. Store the fruit in an air-tight container.

, Ripe avocado can be stored in the freezer for up to six months. To prepare the fruit, peel the avocado, remove the pit, and dice the flesh into small cubes. Sprinkle the cubes with ½ tablespoon (10 ml) of lemon or lime juice. Transfer to an air-tight container and place it in the freezer.


As an alternative, you can also puree the avocado with lemon juice and freeze the puree."

To give your avocado sushi rolls an extra crunch, batter the avocado, dip it in bread crumbs, and deep fry it before rolling it up.

, Avocado may not be the first ingredient people think of when it comes to soup, but avocado and lime soup is a zesty, refreshing, and creamy soup that you can eat as an appetizer or a whole meal.


There are many variations of avocado soup, including creamy soups where the avocado is pureed, and hearty soups where the avocado is in chunks. Creamy avocado soup can be served warm or cold.

, Avocado is full of healthy fats, which means it’s relatively easy to make avocado oil in your own kitchen. Avocado oil can be used for cooking, making bath products, as a skin moisturizer, and as an ingredient in makeup and cosmetic products.

, Avocados can be cut in half and stuffed just like jacket potatoes and deviled eggs. You can make stuffed avocados with meat, seafood, vegetables, dips, and even eggs. The stuffed avocados can be served cold, warm, grilled, baked, and in a number of other ways.

Trim the artichoke stem and leaves.,
Slice off the top couple of inches of the artichoke.,
Cook the artichokes as desired.",How to Select and Store Artichokes," A healthy, fresh artichoke should feel firm and heavy for its size. Lift the artichoke from the pile, and test its weight. You may need to compare it to other artichokes to ensure that it has a good weight for the size.Baby artichokes can be just as delicious as big artichokes. They obviously won’t be as heavy, though, so be sure to consider the weight of a baby variety with other baby artichokes.;
, If the artichoke feels heavy for its size, check out its leaves next. A healthy, fresh artichoke will have green leaves that are tightly packed. Some of the leaves may have purple undertones too, but be sure to avoid any that are brown at the tips.Don’t purchase an artichoke with leaves that are loose, splayed, dry, split, spongy, or pitted.

, When an artichoke feels heavy and has healthy looking leaves, use the “squeak” test to confirm that you’ve picked a good one. Hold the artichoke next to your ear, and squeeze its leaves with your fingers. If you hear a squeak, the artichoke is extremely fresh so it’s a good one to buy.A healthy artichoke’s leaves squeak because they’re still extremely crisp.

, While it may seem like a good idea to wash your artichokes before storing them, it can actually cause them to spoil faster. That’s because the peel can break down if there’s too much moisture, which can lead to infection.You do need to wash artichokes before eating them. Just do it right before you plan to cook or prepare them.

, While you don’t want to wash artichokes before you store them, it’s important to ensure that the stems are somewhat moist when you refrigerate them. Sprinkle a few drops of water over the stems to keep them from becoming dehydrated.Be careful not to use too much water when you’re sprinkling the stems or you run the risk of the artichokes growing mold. To avoid oversaturating the stems, you may want to use a spray bottle with a mist setting and spray the artichokes, holding the bottle at least 10-inches (25.4 cm) away.

, Once you’ve sprinkled the artichoke stems with water, set the artichokes inside a perforated plastic bag. Put the bag in the refrigerator -- if possible, place them in the coldest part of your fridge, such as the crisper drawer, so they’ll stay fresher longer.The artichokes should keep in the refrigerator for up to a week.

, When you’re ready to cook or prepare your artichokes, place them in a colander and rinse them with cold water. Use a soft cloth or brush to carefully rub away any film or residue that may be on the exterior of the artichokes.Be careful when you’re scrubbing the artichokes. If you’re too rough, you may damage some of the leaves.

, After you’ve cleaned the artichoke, use a sharp knife to remove approximately ¼-inch (6 mm) from the stem. Next, use a pair of kitchen shears to carefully cut off the tips or thorns from the leaves.While you should always trim the stem, removing the tips of the leaves is an optional step because the thorns soften when you cook the artichokes.
If you plan to stuff or fill the artichokes, you should remove the entire stem because it’s easier for them to stand up without it.

, Once you’ve trimmed the stem and the tips of the leaves, use a sharp knife to chop off an inch (25.4 mm) from the top of the artichoke. A serrated knife usually works best for cutting through the pointed top.Keep the cut portion(s) of the artichoke from turning brown by rubbing them with a cut lemon.

, After washing and trimming the artichoke, you’re ready to use it in any dish that you’d like. You can boil, grill, steam, and bake artichokes, depending on your preference."

Know what flavor to expect.,
Get what you pay for.,

Store the saffron carefully.,
Crush and soak the threads.,
Toast the threads.,
Crumble and add directly.,
Use a small amount.,
Use saffron in grain-based recipes.,
Add saffron to desserts.,
Combine saffron with other flavors as desired.,
Do your research.,
Take saffron extract for medicinal purposes.,
Make your skin glow.,
Drink saffron milk.",How to Use Saffron," Saffron has a pungent, musty taste and scent with sweet floral accents. When used in excess, however, the taste can quickly become bitter.


Saffron has a flavor profile similar to vanilla: sweet and musky. The two typically work well together, but they are not similar enough to serve as strict substitutes for one another.
Turmeric and safflower are often used instead of saffron to give foods a similar color, but the flavors are much different.;
, Harvesting saffron is a labor-intensive process, so if you want high-quality saffron, prepare yourself for an expensive purchase.


Examine the saffron before you buy it. Good saffron consists of fine, evenly sized threads that are deep red in color with an orange tendril on one end and a trumpet-shaped flute on the other. If the tendril looks yellow, the saffron is likely real but of slightly poorer quality.
Additionally, a stronger scent also indicates a stronger, better flavor.
In comparison, fake saffron may look like shredded, irregular threads with disconnected tendrils and pieces of bark mixed into the package. The scent may not be very strong and usually smells like bark.

, Simply put, whole saffron has a stronger flavor than ground saffron. Ground saffron can be a good substitute if you cannot find or afford the whole spice, though.


If you do decide to buy ground saffron, go through a reputable spice seller. Less honest sellers may cut saffron with other spices, including turmeric and paprika, to reduce the overall cost.

, Saffron doesn't spoil, but it will gradually lose its flavor in storage. Proper storage can preserve the saffron for longer periods, however.


Wrap the saffron threads in foil and place them in an airtight container. Store them in a cool, dark place for up to 6 months. For longer storage, keep the container of saffron in your freezer for up to 2 years.Note that ground saffron should be used within 3 to 6 months and stored in an airtight container and a cool, dark place.

, The process of crushing and soaking saffron releases the maximum amount of flavor from the threads, so it's strongly recommended.


Take the saffron threads you intend to use for the recipe and crush them into a powder using a mortar and pestle. If you don't have a mortar and pestle, you can crumble the threads in between your fingers.Steep the crushed saffron in warm water, stock, milk, or white wine for 20 to 30 minutes. If there's any liquid in your recipe, use a small amount of the specified liquid from the instructions.Add the saffron and soaking liquids directly to your recipe when called for.

, Toasting is another common way to prepare saffron, and it's especially common for traditional paella recipes.


Place a cast iron skillet on the stove over medium heat.
Add the saffron threads to the hot skillet. Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 or 2 minutes. They should release an even stronger aroma but should not be allowed to burn.
Cool slightly and grind the toasted saffron threads using a mortar and pestle. This powder can be soaked or added directly to the recipe.

, While not ideal, you can crumble and add the threads of saffron directly to the dish while you cook it if the recipe calls for a large amount of liquid.


Note that if you use commercially ground saffron, you'll typically add it directly to the dish instead of soaking it.

, In large qualities, saffron will produce a bitter flavor. It's best to prepare and use very small amounts in your dishes.


When possible, count the threads instead of measuring them by volume. Note that a ""pinch"" of saffron equals about 20 medium threads, and a pinch is usually enough in most recipes that serve four to six people.
When using powdered saffron instead of whole threads, note that 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of powder equals about 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of threads.This amount is usually enough for recipes that serve 8 to 12 people; scale it as needed based on the number of servings.

, Most traditional recipes calling for saffron are grain-based, including risotto, pilaf, and paella.


You can find a recipe that calls for saffron or add it to a basic recipe.
As a general guideline, add about 30 threads of saffron to four servings of risotto or pilaf made with 12 oz (300 g) of rice. Add 50 threads of saffron to a paella recipe that serves four., Since saffron has a flavor profile similar to vanilla, it works well in many desserts that typically feature vanilla as the primary flavor.This includes custard, plain pastry, and sweet breads.


For custards, only add a pinch of saffron to the recipe per four servings.
For pastry and plain cookies, use 15 to 20 threads of saffron for every 8 oz (200 g) of flour called for in the recipe. Note that butter accents the taste of saffron better than margarine.
For sweet breads, adding 15 threads of saffron per 1 lb (450 g) of flour will create a subtle flavor, but you can add up to 60 threads for the same amount of flour if you'd prefer a stronger taste.

, If you want saffron to serve as the primary flavor in a dish, you'll need to avoid adding other spices, herbs, or aromatics. When mixed with other spices, however, saffron can give dishes an overall deeper flavor.


When mixing saffron into dishes flavored with other seasonings, it's best to use only a pinch. Add the saffron early on so that the flavor can blend into the other ingredients more thoroughly.
Seasonings frequently paired with saffron include cinnamon, cumin, almond, onion, garlic, and vanilla.
If you plan to add saffron to meat or vegetable dishes, gravitate toward those based on light meats and vegetables. For example, you could try adding it to a chicken or cauliflower dish.

, While saffron is most commonly used in cooking and baking, it can also be used for medicinal or cosmetic purposes. Research the effects of saffron thoroughly before using it for non-culinary purposes, though.


Early research suggests that saffron might be effective as an alternative treatment for Alzheimer’s disease, depression, menstrual discomfort, and premenstrual syndrome.There is little to no research to suggest that saffron is effective against asthma, infertility, psoriasis, digestive trouble, baldness, insomnia, pain, cancer, or other conditions.
Avoid taking more than 12 to 20 grams of saffron since such large amounts can actually be toxic. You should also avoid medicinal saffron if you're pregnant or breastfeeding, or if you're suffering from bipolar disorder, low blood pressure, or various heart conditions.

, Under the guidance of a physician, you could take a pure, high-quality saffron extract to help treat Alzheimer's disease, depression, menstrual discomfort, or premenstrual syndrome.For Alzheimer's disease, take 30 mg per day for 22 weeks to improve symptoms. Note that this will not cure the disease, however.
For depression, take 15 to 30 mg per day. Continue for six to eight weeks. Results may be as effective as a low-dose antidepressant in some individuals.
For menstrual discomfort, take 500 mg of an extract containing saffron, celery seed, and anise up to three times daily for the first three days of menstruation.
For premenstrual syndrome, take 15 mg of an ethanol saffron extract up to twice daily while symptoms last. The effect usually kicks in after two menstrual complete menstrual cycles.

, Topical applications of saffron are traditionally used to lighten, brighten, and clear skin. The exact application procedure will vary based on its intended purpose, though.


Use a saffron milk mask to hydrate and soften skin. Soak a pinch of saffron threads in about 4 Tbsp (60 ml) of cold milk for several minutes, then splash the mixture onto freshly cleaned skin. After it dries, wash it away with lukewarm water.
To treat acne, crush 5 to 6 basil leaves with 10 to 12 threads of saffron, forming a paste. Apply the paste directly to the acne. After 10 to 15 minutes pass, wash away the paste with cool water.
To soften skin over the entire body, sprinkle about 30 threads into very warm bath water. Soak yourself in the water for about 20 to 25 minutes., Aside from being a tasty beverage, saffron milk is commonly believed to help brighten your complexion when routinely enjoyed several times a week.


Boil 2 cups (500 ml) of whole milk over high heat.
As soon as the milk boils, add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) sliced almonds, 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) saffron threads, 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ground cardamom, and 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of honey. Simmer for 5 minutes.Enjoy the drink while it's still hot.

Know the difference between an herb and a spice.,
Consider the difference herbs offer when fresh, versus dried.,
Consider when you add the herb to the meal, particularly with fresh herbs.,
Consider other parts of the same plant that can be used to complement the herb.,
Be careful about the strength of herbs in how much you use.,
Grow your own!,
Wrap food in herbs before cooking.,
Consider the medical aspect of herbs.,
Research online or read cookery books dedicated to herbs and spices.,
Find ways to use more herbs.",How to Use Herbs in Cookery," an herb is usually designated as the leaf material of a plant, where a spice is usually defined as the seeds, flower or flower heads, roots, stems and other parts of a plant. For example, Coriander / Cilantro leaf is an herb, but the stems, seeds or roots of the same plant is typically referred to as a spice.;
, The same herb can have a dramatically different flavour. Some dried herbs can have almost a musty flavour (which is noticeable if cooked in breads or scones), which contrast sharply against the same herb used freshly picked. For long slow cooking, some herbs are better dried as they can be more mellow, or alternatively more lasting flavour than fresh herbs that may lose flavour due to long cooking.

, Some herbs wilt quickly and have an unpleasant texture (especially if used in a salad context). Some herbs give a nice flavour (such as lemon thyme) when used in small quantities as a garnish for a fragrant perfume. Parsley is another good example that if added right at the beginning of a stew, its flavour is quickly lost to other ingredients which can give a pleasant undertone, or it can be added as a garnish just before serving to give the meal a fresh and distinct flavour.

, In many occasions this is technically a spice (as per Coriander / Cilantro), but they can work well together in boosting the herbs flavour, changing flavours or enhancing other flavours.

, Some herbs you only need a small pinch of as they are quite powerful, far less if the same herb is dried as it has shrunk and the concentration is likely to be higher per spoonful. Its sometimes recommended to use half or even far less the amount of dried herb to fresh herb, so if it asks for 1 Tablespoon of fresh chopped parsley in a braise, 1 tsp can be sufficient of dried. This also does vary according to varieties so experimentation is the key.

, Herbs and herb seeds are very cheap to find and can grow for years (especially hardy herbs such as rosemary, sage, thyme etc). Fresh herbs are very tasty additions to meals and growing them adds extra satisfaction.

, This is often done with banana leaves (the banana plant is a herb in its own right) as well as ginger leaves, Ti leaves (in Polynesian and Hawaiian cuisine), cardamom leaves, grape leaves in Mediterranean cuisine etc. The food can then be steamed, poached or grilled to impart a fresh subtle flavour to the parcel contents.

, In Imperial Chinese cuisine, it is said that cooks selected herbs and spices specifically of their health benefits for their patron. Many herbs can offer a treatment such as mint is said to be good for stomach upsets etc, but herbs should not be used to replace a prescribed treatment without the approval of your physician, in case it may conflict with allergies or react negatively to existing treatments.

, These books often have a good chapter showing the varieties of herbs and how to use them as well as good recipe recommendations.

, Such as:


In an herb paste, rubbed onto food prior to BBQ
In marinades
As a garnish
As a repellent to moths in the pantry (bay leaves and rosemary are said to be good for this)
Added to stews, braises, curries, poaching liquids, stocks and soups. A bouqet garni, is a classical bunch of herbs such as parsley, thyme, sometimes rosemary, bay leaf and others for adding as a bunch into a stew or a stock, for easy removal prior to serving.
Added to salads and sandwiches - Vietnamese rice noodle rolls are also a great example.
Added to baked goods such as flans, pies, breads, quiches etc.
The sticks of rosemary or lemongrass can be used as kebab sticks, or used to support roasted food from sitting in fat.
Made into teas, tisanes and other remedies.
Added as table decorations, or into a vase in the kitchen for easy access and as an attractive alternative to cut flowers.

You'll need: 3 cups packed fresh basil, 1/4 cup pine nuts, 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil, 1/2 cup Italian cheese (Parmesan, Romano, etc.), 2 cloves of garlic (depending on taste) and salt and pepper to taste.
Spread the pine nuts on a baking sheet and toast until golden brown. Place the pine nuts underneath a broiler until golden brown or simply bake in a 400 degree Fahrenheit oven for 5-10 minutes, checking often.
Alternatively, toast the pine nuts in a pan over low or medium-low heat on a burner. Stir often.
Pine nuts burn very easily, making them somewhat finicky to work with. When toasting pine nuts, pay attention closely and move them around often. The difference between perfectly toasted pine nuts and burnt pine nuts is often a matter of seconds.
Chop the garlic, cheese, and nuts (optional). Chopping before they are put into the food processor makes a finer ground pesto in the end.
Add the chopped ingredients and basil into a food processor. Add the extra virgin olive oil in the spout gradually as the food is being processed.
If you don't have a food processor, you can also use a blender in a pinch. (Pesto will turn out finer and less grainy when using a food processor.)
Add salt and pepper to taste. Give the food processor one or two more pulses. It's now ready to use on pasta, salad, or bread.

,


Gather some basil leaves. You'll need 1 1/2 cups (packed) fresh basil leaves and 3/4 cup olive oil.

Expect a flavor similar to licorice.,
Anticipate needing only the bulb for most recipes.,
Pair dishes to use the whole thing.,
Use fennel seed as a substitute.",How to Use Fennel in Recipes1," Use fennel to add licorice-like notes to your dishes without overpowering them with actual licorice. It can be eaten cooked or raw, but for the strongest flavor, try raw recipes. Anticipate a slightly weaker profile when cooked.If you find yourself mourning the loss of flavor when cooking fennel, try adding more than the recipe calls for and/or using the fronds as an extra herb.;
, When a recipe calls for fennel, expect it to specify only one part of the fresh piece that you just picked up at the store. Most likely, this will be the fennel's ""bulb."" Don't freak out if you've already used the whole thing when you weren't supposed to, though. Rest assured that all of its parts are perfectly edible, and that the only consequence of using the whole thing is an alteration in the dish's intended flavor.The bulb is the round, ball-like base of the vegetable, usually white and/or pale-green in color.

, Again, expect most recipes to only call for the fennel's bulb, but don't toss out the stalks and fronds just yet. Reduce waste by complementing your intended dish with another that uses the stalks and/or fronds. For instance:The stalks are the dark green shoots growing from the bulb. These leftover bits can replace the fennel bulb called for in cold salad recipes. They can also be sliced up and sauteed like onions to be include in braises, pastas, and stir-fries.
The fronds are the leafy greens growing from the stalks. These can be used for garnish or as an extra herb when cooking.

, Expect most recipes to call for the bulb when it’s being cooked.However, if you can’t find any (or just want to eliminate one more vegetable to prep), substitute the bulb with fennel seed, which you can find in the dried herbs and spices aisle at your grocery store. Use one teaspoon of fennel seed to replace each pound of fennel called for in your recipe.Sizes and weights of fresh bulbs vary, but on average one bulb weighs roughly 8 ounces (227 g).
If your recipe expresses the amount needed in cups, 1 cup of sliced fresh fennel weighs about 3 ounces (85 g).

Consider toasting the teff first.,
Combine the teff and water.,
Heat the pan.,
Reduce the heat.,
Remove from heat when the teff is soft and the water has been absorbed.,
Serve the teff.",How to Cook Teff2," This is optional but it will help to bring forth the flavor.To toast the teff heat it in a hot, dry pan for about 2 minutes.

, Add the cup of teff seeds and 3 cups of water to a saucepan., Heat the teff and water on a high flame until water starts to boil., Turn down the heat and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Stir frequently to avoid having the teff stick to the bottom of the pan., Allow to stand for an additional 5 minutes., Teff has a lightly nutty flavor and can be enjoyed in savory or sweet preparations.

For a savory dish, try serving teff as an accompaniment to steamed greens or with a stew instead of rice.In savory dishes, teff is often seasoned with ginger, garlic, cardamom, chilies, basil or cilantro.For a sweater dish to be eaten at breakfast, try serving teff like oatmeal or other hot breakfast cereals. Add honey and dried fruits like raisins."

Buy teff flour already ground.,
Substitute teff flour for all-purpose flour.,
Make baked goods with teff flour.,
Refrigerate the flour.",How to Cook Teff3," Because teff grains are so small it is very difficult to grind them yourself. Begin by purchasing already ground teff flour.You can find teff flour at a health food store or in some supermarkets.
You can buy teff flour online from companies like Bob's Red Mill and TeffCo.

, The easiest way to use teff flour is to substitute it for part of the all-purpose flour you normally use in your favorite recipes.

Use teff flour for one fourth of the flour in your recipe and regular all-purpose flour for three fourths.Adding some teff flour to recipes adds nutrients and an interesting nutty flavor.
If you have a kitchen scale, substitute teff flour by weight instead of volume. Teff is denser than all-purpose flour so for a more accurate recipe use an amount of teff flour equal to the weight of one fourth of the flour in your recipe.For recipes with whole grain flours like buckwheat flour you can substitute more of the flour for teff flour. Try using half teff flour and half buckwheat flour in a recipe that calls for buckwheat., Teff flour can be used in dishes like pancakes, pie crusts, and cookies and in most recipes that use other whole grain flours.Look for recipes that specifically call for teff flour on websites devoted to teff.
Try using teff flour in scones, muffins, crisps, pies, pancakes, cakes, and shortbreads.
Teff flour is traditionally used to make injera.

, Refrigerate your teff flour after you open the package to keep it fresh."

Peel your avocado, remove the pit, and slice the flesh. Rinse your greens and dry in a salad spinner if needed.Raw bulbs have a crisp, watery texture that’s ideal for salads, so many salad recipes call for them specifically. However, you can also use the leftover stalks from other recipes instead.

, Put your grapefruit in a mixing bowl. Add the onion, fennel, and hearts of palm. Stir them together until everything is evenly coated in grapefruit juice. Use a slotted serving spoon to transfer them to a second mixing bowl. Reserve the grapefruit juice in the first bowl., Add your olive oil, vinegar, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the first bowl. Whisk them into the reserved grapefruit juice. Add your leafy greens and toss to coat., Portion the greens evenly between four plates. Do the same with the whole grapefruit mixture in your second bowl to top each plate. Crumble your Gorgonzola cheese over each serving. Then arrange your avocado slices on each and eat right way."

Focus, at first, on the 1-2 types of cuisine you want to cook the most.,
Know what is in season to find the best vegetables available.,
Read recipes, and then actually make them according to the instructions.,
Dig into the ""how"" and ""why"" of cooking, not just the recipe, when reading cookbooks.",How to Cook Good Food1," The world of food is wide, diverse, and exciting, but you can't tackle it all at once. Think about what you really want to cook, and make an effort to ""master"" a certain type of food -- Italian, Indian, brunch, soups, etc. The good news is that most kitchen techniques are universal, and will translate to any type of food. Focusing on similar dishes now, however, lets you master the flavorings, techniques, and workflow without worrying if it will taste good. You'll improve cooking stills while mastering 4-5 recipes you'll have for the rest of your life. Then you can expand.


Buy 1-2 cookbooks in a cuisine you love, then commit to working through them. Each recipe will teach you a little more about your chosen foods and ingredients, even if it is just a novel way to eat them.;
, In-season means that the vegetable is naturally harvested at the time you're shopping, meaning it is the freshest it can get. Better ingredients lead to better dishes, and in-season vegetables are the best way to get surprisingly great flavor out of even the simplest meals. Going to your local farmer's market can help, as they only carry things in season, but you can do a little research before hitting the supermarket, too.Check out this handy ""Seasonal Veggie Chart"" for help shopping.
Join your local CSA, a vegetable sharing group, to get in-season vegetables delivered right to your door.

, Many home cooks want to just experiment, putting together ingredients based on intuition. This is a great way to get used to cooking and learn how ingredients are used, but it won't turn you into a good cook. Think about it -- would you rather make poached eggs 5 times on your own, hoping to learn the secret to a good batch, or learn from cooks who have already done all the work for you?


When reading recipes, write in the margins! Give yourself tips and notes as you work to make the next cook even better.Experiment! Make yourself try 1-2 new recipes a week to expand your horizons.
As you get better, try recipes that require new techniques, like braising, deglazing, spatchcocking, etc.

, The best way to cook good food, anytime, is to understand the principles of cooking, not the basic steps. For example, you don't need a chemistry degree to make sense of the Maillard Reaction (the golden-brown, sweet flavored crust that forms at high temperatures), but knowing that water gets in the way of it teaches you to pat your foods dry before grilling them. Reading through a cookbook, all of it, is a great way to pick up useful bits of information.

This will be the first of your six colors: red/pink, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. Set the rest of the butter and marshmallows aside for now.You can use fewer colors if you want. You'll still use the same amount of butter and marshmallows for each color, however.;
, This will take about 2 minutes.After 1 minute, pause the microwave and give the mixture a stir with a rubber spatula. If the marshmallows still aren't melted after 2 minutes, continue heating them at 1-minute intervals, stirring between each one., You will only need a few drops of red or pink food coloring.The more you add, the brighter your color will be. You can use either liquid or gel food coloring, but gel would give you the best results.

Learn the key vegetable base of your cuisine, setting up your ""canvas"" for experimentation.,
Understand the power of spices, and which ones match well with which cuisines.,
Salt your food throughout cooking.,
Taste your meal constantly as you cook.,
Understand the power of a good acid.,
Prioritize great ingredients over difficult or complex recipes.",How to Cook Good Food2," In western cooking, a mirepoix is a combination of onions, carrots, and celery used as the base of many kinds of soup, sauces and dishes. There is generally twice as much onion as carrots and celery. You then cook the ingredients until soft in some oil, then use it to start your soup or sauce. It is key in French and Italian cooking, in particular. The longer you cook a base, the deeper the flavor.


For Cajun/Creole dishes, many people substitute green bell peppers for carrots.
In Indian cooking, the ""holy trinity"" is onion, garlic, and ginger. It is used similarly, as a base.
In Spanish cuisine (like paella), use onions, garlic, and tomatoes.
In German cooking, you might use carrot, celeriac, and leek.

Caribbean cooking uses hot peppers, onions, cubanelles, garlic, and cilantro often pounded to a paste.

West African cuisine uses green & yellow onions, hot peppers, bell peppers, and garlic, often pounded into a paste., There are far too many spices to mention them all here, but there are some simple, easy combinations that all good cooks should know. A diverse, big spice rack is essential for cooking different cuisines and imparting subtle, but necessary, flavor to great dishes. The following, though necessarily incomplete lists, is a good starting point.



Italian: Basil, rosemary, thyme, oregano, bay leaves, cracked red pepper, fennel, pine nuts

French: Rosemary, parsley, thyme, basil, bay leaves, marjoram, nutmeg

American: Paprika, chili powder, oregano, basil, thyme -- very open-ended


Mexican: Oregano, chili powder, chipotle, cayenne, paprika, cinnamon, cilantro

Indian: Ginger, cumin, coriander, paprika, turmeric, cardamom, mustard seed, gram masala (spice mixture), clove, hot chili peppers, nutmeg

West African: Paprika, dijon, garlic/onion powder, hibiscus, cayenne, cumin, hot pepper

Chinese: Hot pepper, hot mustard seed, cinnamon, star anise, fennel, clove, ginger, licorice, sesame seeds, chili oilToast powdered or dried spices for 30 seconds in a medium hot pan, then cool them off before using for added flavor and professional complexity., Salt actually changes the chemical reactions taking place as you cook, removing moisture and expanding flavor. Anytime you add a new ingredient to the pan, sprinkle in a light dash of salt. Then, as you taste, you can keep adding salt to taste.Meats should be salted at least 20 minutes in advance of cooking, at room temperature. This removes surface moisture, allowing for a solid, tasty crust to form on the outside or skin., Trust your nose and tongue, not your eyes, when spicing foods. Good cooks are tasting constantly, checking in on their food at every stage of cooking. Spices actually mature in a dish, growing in flavor the longer they cook (so long as they don't burn). When cooking, you must be constantly sampling your food, adding a touch of this or a dash of that where needed.In general, fresh spices need to be added towards the end, so they don't overcook, and dry spices should be added early on to soften and gather flavor.
That said, you don't want to tear the dish apart. In general, a little taste after every new ingredient or spice should cover your bases.

, Whole books have been written about the used of acids, like lemon and vinegar, in cooking. Simply put, they give the food a kick in the pants, an expanding flavors so they pop more when you take your first bite. Acids are best when added at the very end of a dish for a fresh splash of flavor. If your dish is too acidic, add in some fat or sugar to balance it out.Try out:



Vinegar: Balsamic is sweet, white is bitter, rice is light, red wine is hearty, at this is only the beginning. A splash of the right vinegar in the pan, right before removing the food, is heavenly.

Citrus: Usually lemon, lime, or both, though oranges have use in some Caribbean and Asian cuisines.

, Good ingredients make good food. Moreover, you'll learn more from mastering a simple sauce than going for broke with an 8-hour meal. Each of the following recipes are great starters that will not only teach you valuable skills, they also make wonderful dishes:Basic Tomato Sauce (teaches vegetable chopping, sauces, ""mirepoix,"" seasoning)

Know that a well run, well-organized kitchen will make good food much, much easier to pull off.",How to Cook Good Food3," Walk into any kitchen store and you'll notice a dizzying array of items. But the essentials for a good kitchen can get you through 90% of all recipes. While you should expand your tools as you get better and better, you should, at least, start with:


Skillets (1 large, 1 small)
Saucepots (1 5-gallon, 1 1-gallon, or rough equivalents
Roasting pan
Casserole Dish
Dutch Oven (optional, but highly recommended)
Metal mixing bowl(s)
Knife set (minimum -- chef's knife, paring knife, serrated knife)
Cutting boards (at least 2 -- one for meat and one for other)
Dry and wet measuring cups/spoons
Metal tongs.
Mixing Utensils (whisk, wooden spoon, slotted spoon, ladle, spatula), You'll spend more time on your knife than any other tool, and it pays to use it well. Good knife skills don't only make your more efficient, they make your food taste better. Evenly cut vegetables cook evenly, avoiding the bias of meats and onions makes for more tender food, and proper technique saves you from dulled blades and hours of cutting. Some tips for professional knife work include:


Grip the knife with your thumb and curled index finger where the blade meets the handle. You want the back of your hand pointing up, not to the side, for the best control
If the blade is curved, cut forward and back, not up and down. You want to slide the knife through the food so that the curve of the blade slides along the cutting board.
Sharpen your knives every few months. Get the professionally sharpened once or twice a year. Dull blades can slip and cut you, and make cooking much less fun., Everything that you can safely prep ahead of time should be prepped ahead of time. Good cooks are excellent time managers, utilizing every second in the kitchen efficiently so they aren't running around with their heads cut off or leaving things accidentally on the stove.


Chop your veggies.
Measure out ingredients into cups or bowls.
Clean workspaces before cooking, not during.
Get all needed tools and items out of storage and in the kitchen.
Do each stage all at once. Don't skin an onion, then cut it, then skin another, then cut it. Skin all the onions at once, then cut all the onions at once., Good meal planning helps you get the most out of your shopping, re-using ingredients and minimizing waste. Write out a little calendar and plan out meals for the next 2-3 days to start, looking up recipes with some ingredient overlap for the best results


Keep a list of your favorite meals and recipes to make future meal planning easier.
Looking up recipes in advance will also help you see how different ingredients can be used different ways, expanding your cooking vocabulary.

, This makes it lots easier than a big cleanup. More importantly, it keeps your workspaces clean and clutter-free, allowing you to keep cooking or working on new dishes with ease.


Anytime you handle raw meat or fish, wash down all surfaces and utensils used.
Get in a habit of cleaning during downtime (sauteeing, waiting for a loaf to proof, etc.)., Good cooks hit the trashcan and/or compost bin a lot, trimming bits of food and unwrapping or opening ingredients. You'll be faster and more hygienic if you just keep a trash receptacle right on hand.

, Your shrimp are going to burn if you have to run around looking for the sea salt, onions and potatoes will lose flavor and texture if stored wrong, and leftovers will all go to waste if you don't keep the fridge in some semblance of order. There is a reason most professional kitchens are run with army-like precision. While you don't need to go so far as labeling everything you own, an organized kitchen allows all of your energy to go into the food, not finding it.Give yourself ample space, using the biggest cutting boards you can fit.
Keep everything grouped -- spices, vegetables, cooking oils, etc. -- so they are easy to find."

Siphon the oil.,
Pour the olive oil into a clean bottle.,
Seal the bottle with a cork.,
Store the oil in a cool, dry location.",How to Make Olive Oil," You can use unripe green olives or ripe black olives for this process, but either way, it's important to use freshly harvested olives instead of the processed canned type.

Oil made with ripe olives will offer more health benefits than that made with unripe olives, but the taste and smoking point shouldn't differ too much. Also note that unripe olives produce green-tinted oil and ripe olives produce gold-tinted oil.;
, Place the olives in a colander and rinse them under cool, running water. Use your fingers to gently scrub away any dirt.

During this time, you should also sort through the olives and pick out any leaves, twigs, stones, or other debris mixed in with the fruit. These elements can ruin both the oil and the equipment used to produce it.
After rinsing the olives, allow the excess water to drain and pat the olives dry using clean paper towels. The olives do not need to be perfectly dry since any water will eventually separate from the oil, but they should at least be mostly dry, especially if you don't plan to process them right away.

, Ideally, you should grind the olives into oil the same day you obtain them. You can probably wait up to two or three days, if necessary, but waiting for longer periods will decrease the flavor and quality of the oil you produce.If you do need to wait before making the olive oil, transfer the olives into an open plastic or glass container and refrigerate them as needed.
Pick through stored olives before use and discard any that appear rotted, shriveled, or unusually soft.

, Even though you're making a relatively small batch of olive oil—only 1 pint (500 ml)—you may need to separate the full batch into three or four parts while working, depending on the size of your equipment., Place the clean olives in a large bowl with relatively shallow sides. Ideally, you should be able to keep the olives in a single layer.

For homemade olive oil prepared in your kitchen, it's best to use a bowl or similar dish with sides rather than something completely flat. While the first round of grinding won't produce much liquid, using a bowl will allow you to collect any liquid that does come out more readily than a flat board or stone would.

, Using a clean mallet, repeatedly strike the olives, mashing them into a thick, chunky paste.A standard meat tenderizer should work well for this step. Metal and plastic versions are advised, however, since wooden mallets may absorb some of the liquid. Note that you can use either face of the mallet for crushing the olives.
Consider removing the pits while you work. Since the pits are relatively fragile, you might be able to crush them into the olive paste. Doing so won't have a negative impact on your olive oil, but stray bits of seed can damage some of the electric tools you'll need later in the process, so removal is advised.
When ready, the olives should be thoroughly crushed, and the mash should have a slightly shiny coating over its surface. This sheen is the oil. The crushing process breaks apart the flesh of the olives, thereby releasing the oil contained within its cells.

, Spoon the paste into a tall drinking glass or similar dish, filling no more than one-third of the glass at a time.

While you can technically keep the olive mush in its current bowl, the next part of the process can get extremely messy, and using a glass or dish will taller sides may help reduce some of the inevitable splatter.
Alternatively, you can spoon the paste into a durable, high-speed blender. Fill no more than one-third to one-half of the blender.

, Pour about 2 to 3 Tbsp (30 to 45 ml) of hot water into the glass for every 1 cup (250 ml) of olive mush. Quickly stir the contents of the dish to distribute the water evenly and let it sink to the bottom of the glass.

You only need enough water to help facilitate the upcoming blending process; do not add enough water to completely cover the olives.
The water should be hot but not boiling; the extra heat should help release more oil from the paste.Ideally, the water should be filtered or distilled before use since using unfiltered tap water may introduce impurities into the final product.
Note that the water you add will separate from the oil later.

, Using an immersion blender, grind the olive paste down further until beads of oil begin rising to the surface.

Continue the process for at least 5 minutes. Blending the paste for longer intervals should release more oil from the olives, but it also increases the amount of oxidation that occurs, which may result in a shortened shelf life.Use a relatively high-powered blender if you didn't remove the seeds while mashing the paste; otherwise, bits of seed can ruin the blades. If you did remove the pits, however, a standard-power blender should suffice.
You can also use a standing blender for this part of the process, but you'll need to pause and check the progress every minute or so.
During professional extraction, this part of the process is known as ""malaxing,"" and it encourages the smaller beads of oil to combine into larger beads.

, Using a mixing spoon, vigorously stir the mashed olives for several minutes, continuing as needed until the small beads of oil turn into larger beads.

Try to stir the olive paste using circular rotations. The force of each rotation should help draw more oil out of the solid ""pomace,"" or pulp.
This step is also considered part of the malaxing process, but instead of using high speed to separate the oil, you're relying on the direction of the force to separate out the various components.

, Loosely cover the dish with a clean dish cloth, paper towel, or lid. Allow the contents to rest for 5 to 10 minutes without any disturbance.

At the end of this waiting period, it should be even easier to see beads of oil along the surface of the olive paste.

, Cut a piece of cheesecloth nearly twice as large as the mouth of the strainer, and center it over the top of the strainer. Rest the cover strainer over a large bowl.

Fine mesh strainers are optimal for this project, but the cheesecloth should sufficiently trap any solids even if you need to use a wider-gap plastic colander instead.
If you don't have cheesecloth, consider using large sheets of filter paper or clean (i.e. never previously used) painters' straining bags.

, Spoon out the olive paste, including all visible liquid and solids, and transfer it directly to the center of the cheesecloth. Wrap up the sides of the cheesecloth over the olive paste, creating a secure bundle.

Note that the cheesecloth should completely cover the entire batch of olive paste. If it isn't large enough, you should consider separating the paste into even smaller batches.

, Rest a wooden block or similar weight on top of the bundled olive paste. The weight should be heavy enough to actively press down on the bundle.

If you're concerned about how sanitary the weight is, you can wrap it in plastic wrap before placing it on top of the bundle.
Alternatively, you can place a smaller bowl inside the strainer and on top of the olive bundle. Fill this smaller bowl with dry beans or similarly heavy material to apply constant pressure on the bundle.

, Let the olive oil, olive juice, and water drain through the cheesecloth and the strainer for at least 30 minutes. The bowl placed beneath the strainer should collect this liquid as it drains.

Every 5 to 10 minutes, gently yet firmly press down on the bundle using your hands to help the extraction process.
When you're ready to move on, the bowl should contain a decent puddle of liquid and the olive solids inside the cheesecloth should look relatively dry. Note that you can discard these solids at the end of the draining process.

, Place the tip of a baster or syringe just beneath the surface of the collected liquid. Carefully draw out the top layer liquid, leaving the lower layers behind. Transfer this portion of liquid into a separate glass.

Due to the difference in densities, the oil should naturally separate off into its own distinct layer, and that layer of oil should rise to the top of the bowl.
It may take a little practice before you can draw off only the oil without also collecting some water or juice. Inspect the body of the syringe immediately after collecting the oil; if there are separate layers within the utensil, expel the water and leave only the top oil layer.

, Rest a funnel in the mouth of a clean glass bottle, then pour the collected oil through the funnel and into the same bottle.

Glass bottles are ideal, and tinted bottles are even better since the tint should help protect the oil from the harmful effects of strong light. If necessary, however, you may use a plastic container.
Note that any bottle you use should be thoroughly cleaned with hot water and dish soap, rinsed well, and dried before you pour the oil inside.

, Remove the funnel from the bottle before sealing it with an appropriately sized cork, screw cap, or similar lid.

The exact material shouldn't matter too much as long as you can create a tight seal around the mouth of the bottle.
Carefully wipe away any oil from the mouth and sides of the bottle during this step, as well. Dab away small spots with a dry paper towel; wipe away larger splashes using a soapy dish cloth, followed by a clean damp cloth, and finished with a dry towel.

, The olive oil is now finished and ready to use. Store the bottle in your pantry cupboard (or an equally cool, dark, and dry location) until you're ready to use the prepared oil.

Homemade olive oil won't have the same shelf life as commercially prepared oil, so you should use it within 2 to 4 months for the best level of quality.

Lay the parchment paper on the baking sheet and set it aside., Get out a medium mixing bowl and measure all of the dry ingredients into it. Use a whisk to combine the ingredients . Set the bowl aside. For dry seasonings, you'll need:½ cup (64 g) arrowroot powder
2 teaspoons paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 1/2 teaspoons sugar (optional)

, Set a shallow bowl or pie plate on your work surface. Crack 1 egg into the dish and add ½ cup (120 ml) of coconut milk from a can. Whisk the egg and coconut milk until the egg is incorporated. Set the wet mixture aside.Try to use regular coconut milk (not light, since it can be too watery). Avoid using creamed coconut which is very thick and sweet.

, Take 1 large sweet onion (like Vidalia or Walla Walla) and remove the peel. Take a sharp knife and carefully slice the onion into 3/4-inch (19-mm) thick slices. Separate the individual rings, so you have lots of rings in different sizes., Take one onion at a time and dip it in the wet mixture. Turn each ring over, so it's completely coated in the coconut milk/egg mixture. Hold the coated ring up, so the excess mixture drips back into the pan.It may be easier to dip and coat the onion rings in small batches.

Keep them in the oven until you are ready to bake the sandwiches., Take out 24 pieces of white bread. Melt two sticks of butter in the microwave, or in a pot on the stove. Pour the butter into a bowl., Use a pastry or basting brush to apply the butter to the bread. First, butter 12 slices of bread and lay them face down on a cutting board. Then, butter what will be the outside of the other 12 slices of bread., You will need 24 slices of cheddar cheese. Put 2 slices of cheddar cheese squarely on top of 12 slices of bread. Make sure you are putting the cheese on the unbuttered side of the bread. You can put more or less cheese on each sandwich, depending on your preference., Put the remaining 12 slices of bread on top of the cheese. Again, the unbuttered side of the bread should be placed on top of the cheese. You should have 12 sandwiches when you are finished., Take the baking sheets out of the oven once you are done making the sandwiches. Arrange the 12 sandwiches evenly on the first baking sheet. Depending on the size of the baking sheet, you may be able to fit more or less than 12 sandwiches. If you can’t fit 12 sandwiches, use the second baking sheet, and quickly warm up two more baking sheets in the oven.Make sure to use oven mitts to protect yourself when you remove the baking sheets from the oven.

, Once you’ve arranged the 12 sandwiches, lay the second baking sheet on top of them. Be careful as you are doing this because the sheet will likely still be hot from the oven. The second baking sheet acts as a panini press, making both sides of the sandwich crispy., Carefully place the baking sheets in the oven. Allow them to bake for 10-12 minutes. The time may vary depending on your oven, so check the sandwiches after a few minutes. Remove them from the oven when the bread is golden brown, and the cheese has melted. Allow them to cool for a few minutes and then serve warm., You can spread mayonnaise on the bread instead of butter. Any type of mayonnaise will work. Mayonnaise spreads easier than butter, and the bread often comes out with an even golden brown., Experiment with different types of cheeses on your grilled cheese. Outside of cheddar, you can also use provolone, pepper jack, Swiss, mozzarella, etc. Use one type of cheese on each sandwich, or use at least two types of cheeses on each sandwich., If you don’t like white bread, you can experiment with other options. For example, you can use wheat and sourdough bread. Keep in mind that the thickness of the bread will affect baking time."

Peel and slice the potatoes, then add both into the saucepan.


For a twist, use sweet potatoes instead of Yukon gold potatoes. They will give your soup an extra dose of beta-carotene and vitamin A., Chicken broth is recommended, but if you are vegan or vegetarian, you can use vegetable broth instead. Use low-fat, low-sodium broth if you can; this will give you a healthier soup in the end.

, Reduce the heat to low, then let the soup simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. You are ready for the next step when the vegetables turn soft and tender.

, It would be best to use freshly-squeezed lemon juice, but if you can't get any, bottled lemon juice is fine. This will help bring out the other flavors in your soup.

, Measure out half of the soup, and pour it into a food processor or blender. Purée the soup until it is smooth, then pour it into another saucepan or into two bowls. Repeat with the remaining half of the soup.

Stir in ½ cup (120 milliliters) of milk, then simmer until it turns thick.,
Take the saucepan off the burner, then add salt and pepper.,
Use the condensed soup in your recipe.",How to Make Healthy Soup3," A lot of casserole, sauce, and gravy recipes call for canned ""cream of..."" soup. Unfortunately, many condensed, canned soups can be high in fat, sodium, and other unhealthy ingredients. Fortunately, it is easy to make your own. This section will teach you how.

, Cut up 3 tablespoons (45 grams) of butter, and add it to a small saucepan. Allow the butter to melt over medium head.

, Add 3 tablespoons (22.5 grams) of white flour into the butter. Stir it briskly with a fork or mini whisk to combine. Cook the mixture, stirring frequently, until it turns thick.

, Stir it with a whisk until the flour mixture dissolves and everything turns smooth. If your recipe calls for another type of condensed or ""cream of..."" soup, you can use a different type of stock. You can also dissolve some bouillon in ½ cup (120 milliliters) of water.


For a healthier option, use low-sodium chicken stock.
To make cream of mushroom: cook some chopped mushrooms along with the butter. Add the flour and a spoonful of sour cream., If you are looking for a healthier soup base, use low-fat milk. You could also try a non-dairy milk if you are vegan or lactose-intolerant.

, How much salt and pepper you add is entirely up to you. If you are looking to restrict your sodium-intake, consider using less salt, and adding other spices instead.

, This soup is meant to be used as a substitute for canned, condensed soup in dishes such as casseroles and gravies. If you want to serve it as an actual soup, you will need to add about 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water.


You can store this in the fridge for a few days, but it will taste best while it is fresh.

Use a base that is low in fat.,
Watch the sodium.,
Add some vegetables or beans for extra fiber.,
Watch the kind of meat you add into your soup.,
Use whole grains.,
Go easy on the extras, such as bacon, cheese, and sour cream.,
Finished.

",How to Make Healthy Soup4," When choosing broths, go with the low-fat variety. If you are making a creamy soup and the recipe calls for heavy cream, use a lower-fat substitute, such as 2% milk. You could also try a non-dairy milk if you are vegan or lactose-intolerant.


Need a thick soup? Switch out the sour cream for some pureed, mild-tasting white beans. This would also give you an extra dose of fiber, protein, and other nutrients., Cutting fats and calories are not the only ways to make soup healthier. Another common culprit in soup is the excess sodium, and you can make your soup healthier by using low-sodium broths and less salt. This does not mean that your soup has to be flavorless. Try adding some fresh or dried herbs, such as: cilantro/coriander, ginger, garlic, or pepper.


Spices not only add flavor, but they also contain antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties, both of which are beneficial to your health.Other ways to add a salty flavor is to use lemon juice, lime juice, or rice vinegar.Switch out seasoned salt (ie: garlic salt) for herb-only seasoning, such as: garlic powder or onion salt., Vegetables are a great way of introducing antioxidants, fiber, minerals, and vitamins to your diet. Beans can add fiber and protein while making your soup thicker.You can use fresh, frozen, or canned vegetables. If you are using canned vegetables, however, make sure that they are low in sodium.

, Meat is a great way of adding protein to your meal, but it can also add unhealthy fats. Whenever you can, try to use lean meats, such as chicken and turkey, in your soups.If you can't replace the meat you are using, go for a lean or reduced fat option, such as:Extra-lean or lean ground beef
Ground chicken breast or turkey breast
Turkey bacon or Canadian bacon

, If your soup recipe calls for pasta, noodles, or rice, try using whole wheat pasta, whole wheat noodles, or brown rice instead. If you don't like brown rice, you could also try wild rice or pearl barley.Whole grains are full of beneficial fibers, vitamins, and nutrients.

, There is nothing wrong with adding a little bit of bacon, cheese, or sour cream to your soup. Instead of using them in the main body of your soup, however, use them as a topping instead. This way, you will extra the extra flavor, but not the extra fats and calories. Here are some other ways you can cut corners while indulging in the goodies:Use reduced-fat, finely shredded cheese instead of regular, full-fat shredded cheese.
Love bacon? Try turkey bacon or chopped up Canadian bacon instead of regular bacon.
Need sour cream? Try low-fat sour cream or plain, non-fat Greek yogurt.
Want to add some crackers? Try toasted whole wheat break or whole grain crackers instead.

Store your garlic.",How to Make Garlic Powder," Peel each head of garlic and separate all the cloves of garlic within each head. The amount of garlic powder you wish to make will depend on how many garlic cloves you use. Each head of garlic will have about 10 cloves; sometimes a little more, sometimes a little less.For a smaller batch of garlic powder, use one head of garlic. For bigger batches, use more.;
, You can use your fingers to peel away the skin on the clove, or crack open the skin with your knife. Simply place a clove on your cutting board, and lay your knife directly on top of the clove. Gently push on the knife and garlic clove to loosen and crack the skin around the clove.You don’t want to push down too hard on the clove, because you want to keep the clove whole, and in tact so you can slice it. Use your fingers to peel off the skin away.

, Use a knife to slice off the root ends of the cloves.These ends are tough, and not necessary for flavoring. Then use your sharp chef’s knife to thinly slice the cloves of garlic. Slice the garlic cloves about ¼” thin lengthwise, or even thinner if you like.When all the garlic cloves are sliced, place them on a baking sheet or a dehydrator sheet lined with parchment paper., You can dry the garlic in an over or a dehydrator. If you’re using an oven to dry out your garlic, preheat your oven to one of the lowest heat setting.On most ovens, this is between 150 and 200° Fahrenheit. When your oven is completely heated at a temperature between 150°F and 200°F, place the sheet of garlic into the oven and cook for about an hour and a half to two hours.While the garlic is drying, you can check on it and stir the garlic bits around to ensure they are drying out evenly.Remove the sheet of garlic from the oven and let the pieces cool.
You'll know that the garlic is thoroughly dry when the pieces snap, break, and crumble easily in your hand., If you’re using a dehydrator to dry out your garlic, set the temperature to a lower setting, at about 125°F. Allow the garlic to dehydrate for about 8-12 hours.When you remove the garlic from the dehydrator, the garlic bits should be brittle to the touch.That is when you’ll know that they are completely dried.

, You can use a coffee grinder, blender, food processor, spice mill or mortar and pestle to grind up the garlic pieces.Grind the garlic to your desired consistency. Sift through the powder with your fingers and remove any large chunks. These chunks can be gathered and reground.Grind the garlic for a shorter amount of time if you want the powder to be chunkier. Grind the garlic for a longer amount of time if you want the powder to be finer.
Allow the garlic to sit in the grinder for about 10 minutes.This will allow the garlic bits and their fumes to settle, so you don’t breathe in the harsh garlic odors.

, If you happen to have onion or chili powder, red pepper flakes, or other spices around your kitchen, consider blending you garlic powder with other flavors and powders to make a unique and robust seasoning.This blended seasoning can be used on all kinds of food, from pizza to pasta., Store your garlic powder in an airtight container somewhere cool, dry, and out of direct sunlight.Mason jars are a good storage container for homemade garlic powder.


Freezing your garlic powder is also an option."

Use a sharp knife to carefully slice the onion into 1/2-inch (12-mm) thick slices. Pull out each ring, so you have a variety of onion ring sizes., Dip each onion ring into the wet batter, so it's completely coated. Lift each ring up out of the batter and let the excess batter drip off before you fry the rings. This will help them crisp up more., Check the oil temperature to ensure that it's at degrees F (195 C) . Add a few of the coated rings to the oil and fry them for 1 minute or until they're totally golden brown.

, You will be adding 1 ½ more cups (337.5 milliliters) of water into the bowl later, so make sure that it is big enough. Do not use hot or warm water for this step., Try to sprinkle the gelatin as evenly as possible over the water; any clumps will prevent the gelatin from absorbing the water. After a few minutes, the gelatin will start to expand. This step is known as ""blooming."" If a recipe asks you to ""bloom"" gelatin, this is what it means.It will take about 5 to 10 minutes for the gelatin to finish blooming.

, Pour the water into a saucepan, and place the saucepan on the stove. Heat the water over medium heat until it begins to simmer.

, Do not use boiling water, as this will ruin the gelatin.

, You can use a spoon, fork, or whisk. Lift the spoon out of the gelatin from time to time to see if the powder has melted. If you see any specks or granules on the spoon, keep stirring until you don't see anymore granules.

, You can use shaped molds, cups, or small bowls. You may want to lightly grease the inside of each mold with a flavorless oil; this will make it easier to remove later on.

, Once the gelatin is firm, you can either take it out of the mold, or serve it in the cups or bowls.

, Handling the bread is easiest if you have a loaf of unsliced bread, but a slice of bread of works well too. To make fresh breadcrumbs with a grater:









Cut a large slice of unsliced bread that is comfortable to hold by hand. Or pick out a slice of bread from a sliced loaf and cut off the crusts.
Hold the sliced end against the grater. Choose a side with wider teeth holes.
Grate the bread. The bread will begin to crumble against the teeth and fall down in uneven pieces.
Continue grating until your fingers are near the grater. Stop grating before you injure your fingers. Simply discard the last portion of bread.
Repeat with other large slices as needed.

, A food processor is great for chopping soft foods up and grating them finely.









Remove all crusts from the bread, using only the soft centre.
Break the bread into small pieces. Even though a processor will do a good job, it will clog up quickly if there is too much bread to break down.
Process in batches. Process until the crumbs look fine enough for your needs.
Remove from the processor and use fresh.

, If you want to store fresh breadcrumbs, keep them refrigerated and in an airtight container. Use by the date specified on the bread or within a few days of making. .









Breadcrumbs can can also be stored frozen. Use them within 2 months and thaw them in the refrigerator.

Purchase a package of gelatin sheets.,
Place the sheets into large, flat dish.,
Pour enough cold water to cover the sheets.,
Wait until the gelatin sheets ""bloom."",
Prepare 2 cups (450 milliliters) of warm water while you wait.,
Lift the sheets out of the water and remove any excess moisture.,
Add the gelatin sheets to the hot water and stir until the dissolve.,
Pour the gelatin into a mold.,
Leave the gelatin in the refrigerator until it sets.",How to Make Gelatin2," You will need about 4 sheets of gelatin. This is equal to 1 tablespoon of powdered gelatin.You may also find these labeled as ""leaf gelatin"" or ""gelatine.""

, Something like a casserole dish or a baking pan will work great. May sure that the sheets are separated, and sitting right next to each other. You will be pouring water over them. If you don't separate them, they will stick together and not dissolve properly.

, You will need about 1 cup (225 milliliters) of water. Don't worry about making the measurement exact; you will be pouring this water away later.

, They will expand slightly and become wrinkly. This will take about five to six minutes.


Avoid leaving the sheets in the water for too long, or they will break down., Bring the water to a simmer in a pot. Have this water ready and close by. You will be adding the gelatin sheets to it once they bloom.

, You can do this by gently squeezing the sheets in your fist.Be careful not to break them.

, A spoon would work best for this, as the sheets may get caught in a fork or whisk.

, You can also pour it into some cups or small bowls instead. If you are using a mold, you can lightly grease the inside with some flavorless oil. This will make it easier to take the gelatin out o the mold.

, It will take about 4 hours for it to become firm.

Try using Agar instead if you are vegan or vegetarian.,
Make panna cotta with cream instead of water.,
Make fruit-flavored gelatin by using fruit juice instead of water.,
Make lemon-flavored dessert gelatin.,
Consider adding fruit.,
Create different flavors of gelatin and panna cotta to create a layered dessert.,
Pour gelatin into fun-shaped molds to create shaped gelatin.",How to Make Gelatin3," Stir 2 teaspoons of powdered Agar per into 2 cups (450 milliliters) of water. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Keep stirring with a whisk until the Agar dissolves. At this point, you can sweeten it with 2 tablespoons of sugar. Cook it for 2 minutes, then remove it from heat and pour into some molds, cups, or small bowls. It will set in about an hour, but you can speed up the process by putting it into the fridge for 20 minutes.You can also use 1 tablespoon of Agar flakes instead. Soak the Agar flakes in water for 30 minutes first. Drain the water and squeeze the extra moisture out of the flakes. Add the flakes to 2 cups (450 milliliters) of water and cook for 2 minutes.
Agar is made from seaweed. You may also find it labeled as: Agar-Agar, China grass, or kanten., Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of gelatin powder over 6tablespoons of cold water and set aside to bloom, about 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat 4 cups (1 liter) of heavy cream and ½ cup (100 grams) of sugar in a saucepan over a stove. When the sugar dissolves, stir in 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Pour the mixture over the bloomed gelatin, and stir with a spoon to mix. Pour the panna cotta into cups or molds, and let set in the fridge for at least 4 hours.You can also use half-and-half instead of heavy cream. This will give you a lighter panna cotta.
Keep in mind that gelatin made with dairy may take longer to set.

, Pour two packets of unflavored gelatin over 1 cup (225 milliliters) of juice. Boil 3 cups (675 milliliters) of juice, then pour it over the gelatin-juice. Stir until the gelatin is dissolved and everything is combined. Pour the gelatin into molds. You can also use cups or small bowls. Refrigerate for about 4 hours, or until the gelatin becomes firm., Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of gelatin over ½ cup (112.50 milliliters) of cold water and set aside to bloom. Dissolve 1/3 cup (75 grams) sugar in 1 cup (225 milliliters) of hot water. Add in the bloomed gelatin and 3 tablespoons of lemon juice. Stir until everything has dissolved. Pour into molds and leave in refrigerator until it sets., You can place pieces of fruit into the bottom of the mold before you pour in the gelatin. You can also suspend pieces of fruit in the gelatin. To do this, leave the gelatin into the refrigerator until it is almost set. Once it feels like a soft gel, stir the cut pieces of fruit in. Put the gelatin back into the fridge so that it can finish setting.Be careful when adding topical fruits, such as figs, ginger, kiwi, papaya pineapple, and prickly pears. The enzymes in these fruits will keep the gelatin from setting.If you want to use these fruits (with the exception of kiwi) in gelatin, you will need to peel, cut, and boil them for five minutes before adding them to the gelatin.
Kiwi should not be used in gelatin. Even peeling and boiling it will not get rid of the enzyme., Let each layer of gelatin almost set before adding the next layer. You want the consistency to be soft and gel-like. If you add the layers too late, they won't stick together. If you add them too soon, they may melt together., Once you have the gelatin in the mold, let it set in the fridge for about 4 hours. To take the gelatin out of the mold, stick the mold into a bowl of very hot water. Be careful not to get any water onto the gelatin. After a few seconds, pull the mold out and jiggle it. Hold a plate over the top of the mold and flip everything over. Put the plate on a table and lift the mold off. The gelatin should be sitting on the plate now. If it's not, repeat the hot water soak.Try chilling the mold in the fridge for a few hours until you are ready to use it; this will help the gelatin set even faster.

Select the appropriate type of bread.,
Cut the crusts off.,
Place the bread in a freezer.,
Grate the frozen slices.",How to Make Fresh Breadcrumbs2," The best bread style to use for breadcrumbs is white or whole wheat breads without seeds, large grains, or other additions like raisins or berries.









Avoid using bread that is very soft by nature, especially supermarket sliced breads aimed at the sandwich-making market. Some of the stronger white or whole wheat breads like French, or Italian style loaves tend to work well for making fresh breadcrumbs.

, Select the amount of bread slices you'd like to use and cut off the crushes of each slice. If you're using loaves of bread, dig out the soft centre of the bread.









About 4 slices of regular sized bread will make 1 cup of breadcrumbs.

, Put your bread in a freezer bag or a plastic ziplock bag. Pop it in the freezer for at least an hour or until the bread is frozen solid.









You can leave the bread in the freezer for up to 2 months after its expiration date.

, Grate each slice, one by one, on a metal grater. The crumbs will be visibly more fine and even in texture than if you had grated the bread in room temperature.









Your breadcrumbs will eventually thaw to room temperature and will have obtained its fresh taste due to it being frozen.

Chill the cake overnight.,
Loosen the sides with a knife and hot water.,
Use heat to loosen the cake from the base.,
Remove the sides of the pan.,
Slide the cake onto a platter.",How to Remove Cheesecake from a Springform Pan1," This crucial step will make the biggest difference in your cake's final appearance. If it's still warm or room temperature when you try to take it out of the pan, you'll end up with cracks and gouges in your cheesecake. If you're concerned about making sure your cheesecake looks perfect, don't skip this step. Make sure that the cake is at least room temperature or your fridge/freezer will overheat.;
, When you're ready to serve the cake, the knife and hot water trick is the best way to remove the sides of the pan. Take a butter knife and run it under hot water, or dip it in a cup of hot water nearby. Run the knife along the edges of the cake against the sides of the pan. This loosens the cake while keeping the sides smooth.You'll need to wet the knife every few inches to keep it from drying and dragging against the side of the cheesecake.
Don't use cold water, as it isn't as effective as hot water. Using cold increases the chances that the cake will crack or break.

, Removing a cake from the springform pan base is more difficult than taking off the sides. It can help to use a source of heat to slightly heat the bottom of the cake, so that the butter in the crust softens and the cake is easier to move. Use one of the following techniques:



A cook's blowtorch. If you're lucky enough to have one in your kitchen, this is a great tool for warming up the base of a cheesecake. Hold the pan with a potholder. Turn on the torch and with extreme care pass the lit blowtorch under the base. This will heat the butter and soften the cheese just enough to slide the cake out of the pan. Take care not to overheat it!

A gas burner. Hold the pan with a potholder. Turn on your gas burner and carefully hold the cheesecake over the burner to heat up the bottom of the cake. If you don't have a gas burner, you can try a lighter. Again, be careful not to overheat the pan. It will get very hot.

A knife wet with hot water. This is the least preferable method, since wetting the crust of the cake will affect its texture. If you don't have tools to directly heat the bottom of the pan, this is a good option.

, Unlatch the pan and gently lift away the sides. A chilled cake will remain upright, rather than slumping to one side of the other. If you see any small cracks or spots that need correcting, run a knife under hot water and gently smooth out the rough parts.

, Right after heating the bottom, very gently slide the cake onto a platter that you have waiting right next to it. If you have trouble removing the cake from the base, gently push it with the flat side of a large knife to encourage it to move off the base. Push the crush, not the soft cheese filling, which is easily dented.


Many cooks simply leave the cake on its base instead of attempting to slide it off. Feel free to place the entire cake base on the serving platter. You can hide its edges by decorating around the cake with sliced strawberries or raspberries.

Chill the cake overnight.,
Remove the sides of the springform pan.,
Remove the sides of the pan.,
Gather three large spatulas and a friend.,
Slide the spatulas under the cake.,
Lift the cake onto a platter.",How to Remove Cheesecake from a Springform Pan2," A cake that is warm or at room temperature will fall apart if you try to remove it from the pan. It must be entirely firm before you attempt do anything with it.

, Run a knife dipped in hot water along the edge of the cheesecake to loosen it from the sides of the pan. Re-dip the knife as necessary to prevent the knife from dragging at the cake. After loosening the cake, pop open the latch on the pan and lift away the sides.


Don't use cold water to loosen the cake, since it isn't as effective as hot water.
You can cover any cracks or gouges on the sides of the cake by using a knife dipped in hot water to smooth them over.

, Unlatch the pan and gently lift away the sides. A chilled cake will remain upright, rather than slumping to one side of the other. If you see any small cracks or spots that need correcting, run a knife under hot water and gently smooth out the rough parts.

, The spatula method requires someone else's help, since the cake might break if you try to support it using just two spatulas instead of three. Three spatulas should be enough to lift the cake and safely transfer it to a platter. Choose large, flat, thin spatulas that will easily slide under the cake.


You may also want to heat the bottom of the cake before attempting the transfer. This will make it easier for the cake to unstick from the bottom of the springform pan.

, Very carefully slide them between the crust and the springform pan bottom. Keep sliding as far as you can, and try to cover as much area under the cake as possible. Space the spatulas evenly around the cake so no one spot is unsupported.

, Hold two of the spatulas and have a friend grab the third. Count to three with your friend and gently lift the cake onto a platter you have waiting nearby. Do it quickly, but carefully, to achieve the best results.


Make sure you lift at the exact same moment, using the same speed, or else the cake will break.
Once you have the cake on the platter, gently slide the spatulas out from under the cake.

Line the pan with a circle of parchment paper.,
Bake the cheesecake according to instructions.,
Chill the cheesecake overnight.,
Remove the sides of the pan.,
Slide the cake off the base of the pan.",How to Remove Cheesecake from a Springform Pan3," If you haven't yet baked your cake, this trick will make removing the pan much easier. Cut out a circle of parchment paper slightly larger than the base of the springform pan you're using. Press it into the bottom of the assembled springform pan. You'll bake the cake on top of the parchment, rather than directly on the pan. This way you can just slide the bottom of the cake off the pan with the parchment, which looks a lot less noticeable than a metal base.


Some chefs also like to use a cardboard cutout to lend the cake a little more support. Cut out a piece of cardboard the same size as the base of the springform pan. Press a piece of parchment paper over the cardboard.
If you want to line the sides of the pan with parchment as well, cut  a strip long enough to wrap around the inside of the pan and slightly thicker than the depth of the pan. Now you can make your cheesecake as normal, and when it is completely chilled the cake can be removed with ease from the pan.

, The presence of parchment won't change anything about the baking process. Go ahead and bake the cheesecake as usual.

, Even parchment won't save a cheesecake that's still warm when you try to remove it from the pan. Be sure it's thoroughly chilled before you try to lift away the sides or bottom.

, If you didn't line the sides with parchment, run a knife dipped in hot water around the edges of the cake to loosen it, then unclick the pan's sides and lift them away. If you did line the sides with parchment, you can skip the knife trick and simply take off the sides of the pan. Then very gently pull away the strip of parchment to reveal the cake underneath.

, Grasp the edge of the parchment paper and gently slide the cake onto a serving plate. The parchment will lift easily from the bottom of the springform pan.

Dill:
Parsley
Rosemary
Thyme
Chives

, Cooking with red or white wine is a great way to concentrate flavor in your food. Add about 1/2 cup of red or white wine to your dish and let it cook down so the wine reduces. Avoid using cooking wine or sherry which usually have salt added and are high in sodium.For example, add red wine to a pasta sauce and let it simmer for an hour to amplify the flavor. Or you can add a splash of white wine to a seafood pasta sauce and let it cook down.

, If you're cooking something that calls for a lot of water, you can usually replace it with a chicken, vegetable or beef stock. Ensure that the stock is salt-free (which is easy to do if you're making it at home). The stock will be more flavorful than the water and you won't even need to add salt.


For example, if you're making a vegetable soup, replace the water with a stock for additional flavor.

, Mix up a quick salt-free marinade for meat or vegetables and heat up your grill. Grilling your food will give it a great smoky flavor and you won't even need to use salt.
