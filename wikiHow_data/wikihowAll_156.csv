Choose thin-petaled, edible flowers.,
Prepare the flowers.,
Prepare the egg white glaze.,
Brush a thin layer of egg white on each flower.,
Sprinkle superfine sugar over each flower.,
Let dry overnight.,
Store the flowers.,
Decorate cakes or centerpieces.",How to Sugar Flowers," Violets and pansies (Johnny-jump-ups) are some of the easiest edible flowers to sugar. Other options include cherry blossoms, nasturtiums, marigold, and borage.Pick the flower in the morning for lower risk of wilting. Choose blossoms that are fully opened but not wilting, for best flavor.Edible flowers with thick petals or petals that grow in clumps may not harden into stiff shapes. They can be sugared for next-day use, but will not last much longer. These include carnations, dandelions, roses, red clover, and lilacs.
Never use flowers that have been in contact with pesticides, that grew alongside a road, or that have any obvious damage.;
, Shake them to remove excess dirt or any insects. Use scissors to trim off the bitter stems. Remove the stamens using tweezers, then wash under running water. Drain and let dry on paper towels in a warm spot away from direct sunlight.


Optionally, you can gently tug apart the flower petals and sugar them individually. Individual petals are easier to work with than full flowers, especially for flowers with clumps of petals., Beat one egg white with a fork until frothy, about one minute. If it's thick and difficult to brush on, add a small spoonful of water.Eating raw egg white can cause food-borne illness. To avoid this, mix dry pasteurized egg white powder with water instead.Do this if you are serving a large group, or selling the flowers.
To separate the egg white, crack the egg gently. Move the yolk back and forth between the two eggshell halves. Repeat until the yolk and white are separated.

, Hold the edge of the flower or petal with a pair of tweezers. Use a new paintbrush, that has never been used for anything but food. Use a small brush to avoid tearing the petals.


If egg is too thick to brush on easily, stir in a few drops of water.

, Use a spoon to sprinkle superfine granulated sugar completely over both sides of the flower. Once covered, gently tap the flower to remove excess sugar. A fine layer should remain, with the color of the flower visible underneath.


Superfine sugar is also called berry sugar, caster sugar, or castor sugar.
You can make your own superfine sugar by blending regular white granulated sugar., Place the flowers on a wire rack or cookie sheet covered in wax paper. Let dry at room temperature until the base is completely dry and the flower is stiff. This takes between 12 and 36 hours.The sugared flowers will be brittle, so take care when handling them.


If your oven has a pilot light, you can leave the oven ""off"" and keep the flowers in with the door closed for 8 hours. Alternatively, set any oven to the lowest setting (no more than 200ºF / 90ºC) and leave with the door ajar for a few hours, checking frequently to avoid burning., Store the flowers in an airtight container at room temperature away from direct sunlight. Separate layers with paper towels or tissue paper.


Thin-petaled flowers that have completely dried should last for a few weeks or months this way.Flowers with thick petals may only last a few days.

, Sugared flowers are often stuck onto cakes, using a dab of icing. You can even create a flower out of sugared petals this way, with a steady hand and pair of tweezers.

Serve warm.",How to Steam Bammy," Use a sharp knife to cut away the peel in strips.


The peel of the cassava is very thick and covered in a wax-like coating, so you won't be able to use a vegetable peeler to remove it.
When using fresh cassava, make sure that you use the sweet variety usually sold in a market, not the bitter variety. Cassava contains toxic substances. In sweet cassava, those substances are concentrated in the peel. In bitter cassava, those substances are evenly spread throughout the flesh, as well.
After handling the cassava peel, make sure that you wash your hands with soap and water. Rinse the peeled cassava under running water, as well.;
, Scrape the cut end of each cassava chunk against a box grater to shred it into thin strips.

, Place the grated cassava in a clean dish towel. Close the towel up, then wring out as much juice as possible using your hands.


Removing most of the juice will also further reduce the amount of toxins in the cassava. The amount of juice you'll be left with after thoroughly wringing it out should not pose a threat.
Discard the juice down the drain of your sink. Thoroughly rinse the sink out afterward.

, Open up the towel and sprinkle the cassava with salt. Toss the shreds gently to help spread the salt evenly over the pieces.

, Separate the mixture into 1-cup (250-ml) portions. Use your hands to form each portion into a tight, compact ball.


Usually, this amount of cassava will create four to six portions.

, Place each ball on the counter and lightly press down on it until you create a thick disc.


Each disc should be about 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter and 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick.
If the cassava seems to be sticking, you may need to dust the counter with a little flour before flattening out the discs.

, Place the cassava flour in a large bowl and sprinkle the salt on top of it. Use a wooden mixing spoon to stir the two ingredients together thoroughly.


Cassava flour has been been professionally processed, so it should not contain the same toxins that raw cassava has. As such, this option might be safer, especially if you've never worked with cassava before.

,


You will probably need at least 1.25 cups (310 ml) of water, but you might need an additional 1 cup (250 ml) after that.
Add the water in 1/4 cup (60 ml) portions until the dough holds together.
Stir well after each addition.

, Cover the bowl of cassava dough and set it aside. Let it rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.


If the bowl does not have a lid, you can cover it with a clean, damp dish towel or loose sheet of plastic wrap.

, Separate the dough into 1 cup (250 ml) portions. Use your hands to mold each portion into a ball.


You may need to dust your hands with additional cassava flour to prevent the dough from sticking.
This amount of cassava should give you four to six portions.

, Lightly dust the counter with cassava flour. Place each portion of the dough on the counter and roll it out into a 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) thick disc.


You may need to dust the rolling pin with cassava flour, as well.
Each disc will also be about 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter.

, Combine the broth and coconut milk in a large skillet. Heat the two ingredients together over high heat until they reach a boil, then reduce the heat to low.


Make sure that the heat drops to a slow simmer before continuing.
The liquid should only be about 3/8 inch (1 cm) high, if not lower. If it's too high, you could accidentally boil the bammy. You only need enough liquid to create a good, steady amount of steam.

, Cover the pan, then cook the bammy for 3 to 4 minutes per side.


You must cover the pan to trap the steam inside.
Only uncover the skillet when flipping the bammy discs over. Opening the lid too often will prevent the steam from building up, which could result in undercooked bammy.
When finished, the bammy will look like pale bread instead of dough. Remove it from the skillet at that point.

, If you want to brown the bammy, you will need to preheat the broiler while the bammy cooks.


If your broiler has separate ""low"" and ""high"" settings, preheat it to ""low.""
Steaming alone will not brown this flatbread. If you want to brown it, you will need to do so using a broiler.
Browning is not strictly necessary, but it is recommended.

, Place the broiler pan in the preheated broiler for a few minutes, or until both sides are lightly toasted.


You will need to turn the bammy halfway through the broiling process.
Each side will need about 2 minutes to brown.

, Remove the bammy from the skillet or the broiler pan, and enjoy it while it is still fresh and hot.

, Pour the oil in a large skillet and heat it on medium-high for a minute or two.


The oil should become glossy and thin. Turn the pan gently to make sure that the entire bottom is coated in oil.

, Fry the patties in the oil, turning once halfway through.


Both sides should be lightly toasted.
The edges of the bammy patties should also begin to shrink inward.

, Remove each bammy from the hot oil and transfer them to a shallow baking pan. Pour the coconut milk over the bammy patties, and let them soak for 5 to 10 minutes.


Each bammy should be thoroughly saturated with coconut milk from top to bottom.
The coconut milk adds flavor to the bammy. It also adds a little extra moisture, and this moisture is what will produce the steam needed to finish cooking the bammy.

, Cook for another 3 to 5 minutes.


Keep the lid on the skillet to trap the steam inside.
The bammy will be a little deeper in color after this step. They should still be a light shade of brown, though. Keep an eye on them to make sure that they do not burn or turn deep brown in color.

, Remove the bammy from the skillet and enjoy it while it is still fresh and hot.

,
Store your coconut flesh until you're ready to eat it.",How to Shell a Coconut," On 1 end of your coconut, there will be 2 or 3 dark indentations. These indentations are the coconut's weakest points.;
,, Place the end of the coconut with the holes upside down on top of an open container so the liquid can drain into it.

, The towel must be big enough to envelop the entire coconut.

,, Hit the wrapped coconut with force several times to break it open.


Strike the broken coconut parts repeatedly to break down the pieces. Doing this will result in much smaller pieces, so the coconut flesh is easier to remove from the inside of the shell.

, Use a small knife to pry the coconut flesh away.

,,


Place the coconut flesh in the refrigerator. It will stay fresh for 2 to 7 days.
Put the coconut flesh into the freezer. It will stay fresh for 1 to 3 months
Grate and/or shred your coconut flesh and then dehydrate it. Doing this will extend the freshness on your coconut to 6 to 12 months.

Determine how many carrots you will need.,
Wash the carrots.,
Peel the carrots.,
Pick a grater.,
Position your grater.,
Shred the carrots.",How to Shred Carrots1," The number of carrots you will need depends on how much shredded carrot you need for your recipe. Keep in mind that you can always shred more if one shredded carrot is not enough. Some general equivalents include:one large carrot = one cup of shredded carrot
one pound of carrots = two and half cups of shredded carrots;
, Run the carrots under cool water and use your hands to scrub the outside of the carrots.This will help remove any dirt, chemicals, or germs on the outside of the carrots.


Make sure you use full sized carrots. Baby carrots are hard to shred by hand and you also run the risk of shredding your fingers.

, Take the washed carrots and place them on a cutting board. Cut off the top and bottom tip, about ¼ to ½ inch on each side. Then, using a vegetable peeler, remove the skins of each of the carrots in turn./images/thumb/e/ea/Shred-Carrots-Step-3-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Shred-Carrots-Step-3-Version-5.jpg

If you don't have a vegetable peeler, you can use a knife. Just be careful not to take too much of the carrot away with the peeling.

, There are two common types of graters, the box grater and the plane grater. You may have one in your kitchen already, or you may need to pick one up at a kitchen store or at a department store.



Box grater. The box grater is a larger grater with three or four sides and a handle on top. The sides have different sized holes. This is so you can have for different sized pieces when you shred the vegetables.

Plane grater. A plane grater is a flat, rectangular grater with a handle on one side. You should use whichever one you need for the size of shredded carrot that you want., You will want to use your grater on a clean surface in your kitchen, such as on a counter or island. You may also want to place the grater on a cutting board or over a large bowl to catch the grated carrots. Make sure that whatever you use will catch the carrot shreds as you grate them.

, Once you have positioned your grater, grab a carrot and hold it in your hand. Put the bottom edge of the carrot against the side of the grater near the top. Gently apply pressure to the carrot and move your hand down the side of the grater. Once you get to the bottom of the grater, move your hand away from the grater and move the carrot back up to the starting position. Continue this motion until you finish shredding all the carrots.

When you get to the very end of a carrot, watch your fingers as you shred. The edges of the grater are sharp and will cut you if you rub against them. You can also use a sharp knife to cut the small remaining piece into thin strips if you don't want to cut your fingers.
Be careful not to push too hard on the carrots. You can break the carrot in two and possibly injure your hand."

Check your recipe or consider what you need.,
Peel the carrots.,
Cut the carrots.,
Attach the food processor blade.,
Put on the tube.,
Shred the carrots.",How to Shred Carrots2," If you know how many carrots you need to shred, then you can just use that amount. However, if your recipe calls for a certain amount of shredded carrot without specifying how many carrots to use, then you may need to estimate.


Keep in mind that one pound of carrots is about the same as two and a half cups of shredded carrots and one large carrot is about the same as one cup of shredded carrots., Take the carrots you've picked for shredding and wash them under cool water. Cut off the top and bottom edge of the carrot in ¼ to ½ inch pieces. Take a vegetable peeler and remove the skins of the carrots.


Make sure to rub your hands along the carrots when you wash them to get off any excess dirt, germs, or chemicals that may be on the surface.
If you don't have a vegetable peeler, you can use a knife instead. Be careful not to cut off too much of the meat of the carrot when you peel them this way.

, Take the peeled carrots and cut them into 3 inch long pieces. This is to ensure that they are small enough pieces that they can easily fit in the food processor feed tube./images/thumb/2/2b/Shred-Carrots-Step-9-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Shred-Carrots-Step-9-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/2/2b/Shred-Carrots-Step-9-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Shred-Carrots-Step-9-Version-3.jpg









You can also use baby carrots in a food processor. They are small enough to fit in the feed tube of the food processor and will shred nicely.

, Every large food processor comes with a shredding blade. Find the shredding blade for the food processor. It should be a large metal disk with raised grater marks on one side. Once you find it, fit it into the food processor.


The blade will sit at the very top of the food processor bowl. This is so the shredded carrots can fall off underneath it into the bowl without building up under the blade.

, Now that you have the blade on the food processor, you need to put on the lid of the food processor that has the raised column on it. Fit the safety lid on the lid as well, but remove the cylinder inside the lid.


The opening that remains is where you will stuff the carrots.

, Once the lid and safety lid is in place, turn on the food processor. Stick the first three inch piece into the tube at the top of the lid. Using the cylinder, push down the carrot against the shredding blade. Keep pushing it down until the whole carrot is shredded. Repeat until all of your carrots are shredded.


Do not push down the carrots with your fingers. You can cut your finger or even lose a finger. Always use the plastic cylinder that came with the food processor.
Once you are done shredding the carrots, turn off the food processor and wait for the blade to stop moving. Then, take off the top and remove the blade to get to the shredded carrots.If you own a small food processor, you can still use it to shred carrots. Put the blade into the food processor and lock the bowl and blade into the processor. Then add the peeled and cut carrots. Secure the top and then pulse the food processor until the carrots are small enough for your recipe.

Dry produce after washing.",How to Wash Fruit and Vegetables1," Remove fruits and vegetable from any packaging.


The water rinse method is effective for all fruits and vegetables. However, some types of vegetables, including broccoli, lettuce leaves, or spinach, often require additional attention and cleaning.
If you have packaged produce labeled ""ready-to-eat,” “washed” or “triple washed,” do not re-wash.For fruits and vegetables that have a skin, the Food and Drug Administration recommends that you wash them BEFORE you peel them.Remove stickers from produce.The stickers on fruit are made of edible paper; however, it is best to remove them before washing. Otherwise, the part underneath the sticker will not be cleaned.;
, Use warm, soapy water to make sure that your hands are clean before handling any fresh produce. Wash for at least 20 seconds.,, After you prepare each food item, wash kitchen surfaces and utensils with hot, soapy water.


Keeping your workspace clean is especially important if you have peeled your produce without washing it. Bacteria from the outside of raw produce can be transferred to the inside when it is cut or peeled., You'll want to make sure the water is potable, meaning safe to drink.You can use warm water, but it's best used if you're planning to cook the fruits and vegetables after washing.
Place a colander in the sink to expedite the process of rinsing your produce. Because you can wash more than one thing at once, a colander is especially useful if you are cleaning fruit and vegetables that are loose, such as beans or fresh peas.

, Some fruits and vegetables, like raspberries, which crush easily and become mushy when they take in too much water, should not washed vigorously. Instead, put delicate produce in a colander and gently spray with water.Mushrooms need to be cleaned differently than other vegetables. If you rinse them too much or soak them water, they will become soggy. If you must rinse them, do it lightly, with just a sprinkle of water. Dry immediately and gently with paper towels. The best way to clean mushrooms is wipe them with a clean, just damp cloth or paper towel., Use a vegetable brush to scrub produce such as potatoes and carrots, which are grown in soil, or cucumbers and melons. Brushing them helps to wash away hard-to-remove microbes; just make sure the brush isn't too rough or it could damage the produce., Make sure there are no specs of dirt or any tiny bugs remaining on your fruit and vegetables. If you find some, re-wash the produce.

, Dry everything you have rinsed with clean paper towel. This will remove any lingering bacteria."

Julienne the carrots.",How to Shred Carrots3," Check your recipe to see if it says how many carrots to julienne. If you are not sure, remember that you can always julienne a little more than you think you need. In general, one large carrot equals one cup of shredded carrots., Take your carrots and wash them under cool water. Cut off the top and bottom tip of each carrot in about ¼ to ½ inch pieces. Using a vegetable peeler, peel the skin off of each of the carrots.If you don't have a peeler, you can use a knife. Just make sure you do not cut too much of the meat of the carrot off as you do it.

, With a sharp knife, take each carrot and cut them into one and a half to two inch pieces. This will make it easier to julienne the carrots. Next, cut one rounded edge off one side of the carrot to keep the carrot from rolling across the counter.


Don't throw away the slice of carrot you just cut off. You can cut it in two to three pieces and use them as uneven julienne carrots.

, Using a sharp knife, take each square block and cut the carrots lengthwise. You can cut them from 1/16 of an inch to 1/8 of an inch, depending on how large you want the shreds to be.

These don't have to be super precise, just make sure you get them about the same size.

, Stack the carrot slices on top of one another so that they are even. Then, use a sharp knife to cut the pieces into small matchsticks. They should be the same width as the thickness you cut them into before so that they make even slices.

Continue to cut until all of the carrots are in matchsticks.Make sure you do this slowly. As you cut the stack of carrots, slowly move your finger back, keeping them away from the edge of the knife. This may prove more difficult as you get closer to the edge of the carrot slices. Just do it as best you can and keep your fingers as far away from the edge of the knife as possible.You can also buy a finger guard if you are worried about cutting your fingers. These are stainless steel tools that help you hold the vegetable while protecting your fingertips from being cut."

, The amount of water will depend on the amount of rice, but will typically be no more than one tablespoon of liquid per cup (340g) of rice. There should be enough moisture to steam the rice, but not enough that the rice is sitting in a puddle of water after heating., If there are large clumps of rice sticking together, they won’t heat as evenly as everything else, and the rice within the clumps won’t get the moisture it needs to be fluffy again. Use a fork to smash these clumps apart so that it’s all about the same size., To keep the moisture in with the rice, cover your container with a lightweight plate or microwave safe plastic lid (but don’t seal it completely). Or try covering it with a damp paper towel to give it a bigger boost of moisture., Use high heat as you warm the rice in the microwave. The amount of time will depend upon the amount of rice you have. About 1-2 minutes should be enough for one serving.If reheating rice that was frozen, heat for 2-3 minutes in the microwave.The container will likely be hot, so allow it to stand in the microwave for 1-2 minutes afterward, or use oven mitts to remove it.

Use this method for fruits and vegetables with a lot of surface area (such as grapes), that are attached or packed tightly (like strawberries or blueberries) or have deep crevices (cauliflower, broccoli, and leafy greens).

, Make sure there is a bit of movement here so that the outside of the produce can be thoroughly cleaned.


This method is effective for grapes and other foods which have a lot of surface area and are tightly packed. Because they are immersed in water, the water can cover their entire outer surface, something that is considerably harder to do with just a rinse.

, Vegetables like cauliflower, broccoli, and leafy greens need extra attention because they have lots of places where dirt and microbes can hide.Leafy greens have their own particular method for cleaning. First, separate the leaves first. Then, soak the leaves and drain them in a strainer or colander. Repeat this process. The goal here is dilution. Once finished, dry with a clean towel or salad spinner.Soaking all kinds of fruits and vegetables - not just your greens, but fruits like strawberries too - has recently become popular. Soaking is a restorative process that can revive your produce, enhance its taste and prolong its life., Use warm, soapy water to wash your colander, salad spinner or basin when ready to move on to another fruit or vegetable.

, Soak fruits and vegetables of all varieties in water for 5 minutes with 1-2 teaspoons of salt. Then, rinse to wash out the salt.

, Soak produce in a mixture of water and vinegar (1/2 cup distilled white vinegar per 2 cups of water) for 5-15 minutes. Then, rinse.This has been shown to move pesticides and reduce - though not eliminate - bacteria. This solution may, however, affect texture and taste., These washes, basically rinses and other treatments, are now sold in grocery and health food stores.


Some brands include: Dr. Mercola's Fruit and Vegetable Wash, Fit Organic Fruit and Vegetable Wash, Ozone Water Purifier XT-301, J0-4 Multi-Functional Food Sterilizer (Indoor Purification Systems, Layton, UT).
Researchers at the University of Maine tested some of these products against a basic water wash and found no significant differences between a ""fruit veggie wash"" and a water wash.

, Dressing will not stick to wet lettuce, so you'll have to make sure it is dry before you start tossing it. Rinse the leaves with water, and then dry them in a salad spinner. If you don't have a salad spinner, gently pat them dry with clean paper towels instead.

, This might mean cutting or peeling the vegetables a certain way.

, This includes things like tomatoes, carrots, and cucumbers. They will help spread the dressing around better if they are at the bottom. They will also be less likely to bruise the lettuce.


Consider leaving some of the heavier ingredients for garnishing at the end.
If you are making a fruit salad, you can put everything in at once.

, If this is a pasta salad, you can add the pasta at this point. If you plan on adding herbs, save them until the very end.

, If you are making the salad in advance, don't put the dressing in yet. If you add the dressing in too soon, your salad will be soggy by the time you are ready to serve it., You will be adding the dressing bit by bit as you toss the salad. This will keep you from using too much dressing. It will also ensure that the dressing mixes into the salad evenly.


Too much dressing is not a good thing. It will overpower the different flavors in the salad. The dressing should just cover the lettuce, and not pool at the bottom.

, If you don't mind getting dirty, you can also use your hands instead — just make sure that they are clean.

, Lift some more salad from the bottom of the bowl, and bring it to the top a few more times.

, Keep doing this until you have used up all your dressing for the recipe. Plan on using about 2 to 4 tablespoons of dressing for every 4 cups of salad.

, This will help their flavors really shine through.

, Does it need more dressing? What about salt and pepper?

, Don't let it sit too long, or the dressing will cause it to grow soggy.

Make a roux (a butter and flour sauce).,
Use cornflour or cornstarch.",How to Thicken Stew2," This basic sauce is the trick to adding flour to a stew to thicken it without creating lumps. Mix equal amounts of butter and flour together in a separate pan. Heat the roux to thicken into a smooth paste-like sauce.









Add the roux bit by bit to the stew, stirring constantly. Doing this gradually is as important as making the roux with care, to avoid creating lumps. The stew will soon thicken and the flavor will be enhanced rather than changed.

Vegetable oil can be substituted for the butter if preferred.



, Mix a tablespoon of cornflour or cornstarch per cup of stew liquid with enough water to make a paste. Stir thoroughly until a smooth paste forms. Add gradually, stirring constantly, until the stew thickens up enough. Make sure that each addition is fully integrated, if you add too much the sauce will turn into a paste.









Arrowroot can be substituted for cornflour or cornstarch. It has a more neutral flavor than cornstarch and can be used at varying temperatures without losing its ability to thicken foods. It tolerates acidic ingredients better than cornstarch and it can be cooked for a longer length of time."

Learn the characteristics of fats.,
Know the cooking method you are going to use and select the fat accordingly.,
Determine the important characteristics for your cooking method.,
Find a fat with the properties you need.",How to Properly Cook With Oils," Fats come to us from many sources - animal and plant - and thus can have very different properties. Luckily, when cooking, only a few are important:



Flavor. Though the fats themselves are generally odorless, they carry with them a variety of chemicals (or lack of them) that can vary between the strong flavor of unrefined palm oil to the bland flavor of canola oil, or from the subtly sweet flavor of coconut oil to the grassy richness of a good quality tallow. Unfortunately, flavor is a terribly subjective (and complicated) beast, and so it is impossible to properly discuss it here.

Viscosity. A measure of how ""thick"", or liquid, the fat is when melted, it is important to the ability of fats to prevent foods from sticking to pans, and changes how the food feels in the mouth. It is primarily affected by how big each molecule of fat is, expressed as the chain length: long chain lengths mean high viscosity oils which flow slowly and coat surfaces thickly.

Melting Point. The temperature that the fat melts at. This is important if the dish is to be served (or prepared) cold, or if the melting point is higher than the temperature of the mouth: if the fat solidifies, the food feels greasy, and many sauces and dressings break. Melting point is influenced by the percentage of saturated fat and how big the average chain length is: saturated fats and long chain lengths give us fats with high melting points.

Smoke Point. Different oils will begin to smoke at different temperatures.

Chemical Reactivity. Fats can be oxidized by the air, especially at high temperatures, which damages flavor and is bad for health. For these reasons, this article suggests not cooking with (poly)unsaturated oils, which are more reactive than other fats, at high temperatures or for long periods of time.;
, In different foods and cooking methods, the role of any included fat varies, and thus your selection criteria will be different:



Pan-Frying, Stir-Fry, Sauteing. Other than flavor, the most important considerations are viscosity and reactivity; ideally, you will choose a viscous fat (to prevent the food from sticking and burning) which is highly saturated (so that it doesn't oxidize). It is also important to pick a fat which will not smoke at the high temperatures involved.

Deep Frying is rather forgiving, but prefers a nonreactive oil (so that it doesn't oxidize). Depending on preference, you may want to use a viscous oil (which will coat the fried food thickly), or a thin oil, to minimize the fat content of the cooked food.

Hot Soups and mixed into Baked goods, only the flavor matters.

Applied to the outside of baked goods, flavor still usually dominates, but reactivity is a potential consideration, due to the high surface temperatures.

Salad Dressings, Mayonnaise. It is vital that the food stay warmer than the melting point of the fat, or the emulsion will break, leaving you with two nasty layers rather than a creamy sauce.

, An incomplete list is provided above, but feel free to apply these basic criteria:


If your food sticks, use a more viscous fat.
If your oil smokes, use a fat with a higher smoke point.
If you are cooking at a high temperature and/or for a long time, use a nonreactive (saturated) fat.

, Often, you'll need to make a compromise, in which case there are a few options:


Mix different fats together to average their properties. For instance, mix some tallow into your coconut oil to increase the viscosity while still keeping the fat mixture liquid in the mouth.
Add your flavorful, but delicate or reactive, fats after most of the cooking is done.

, Each one will require different treatment. Check recipes online for specific ingredients and how they can be used in a different dish that you could make from what you have.


A green salad is ruined if it sits in dressing too long and gets limp. There's little to do but add it to a soup (canned or from stock) and cook it.
Vegetables are ruined if they are cooked until mushy. Again add them to a soup, or mix with eggs and bread crumbs/flour, butter, and flavors to make a baked casserole.
Meat is ruined if it's burned or cooked until dry and shriveled. Cut off burned parts, and chop the remainder into small bits to use in soup, or add to a vegetable mix, omelet, or meat pie. (see recipes for meat pies or quiches)
Soup is ruined if it gets too salty, thick, or thin. To remove salt, float slices of raw potato in it and boil lightly, then remove and discard the potato. Water down thick soup with any liquid (water, broth, juice, milk, etc.) and thicken soups with bread bits, oatmeal, pasta, rice, or grains (barley, couscous).
Stews are ruined if they cook dry, or too many flavors clash. For dry stew, add any liquid (as in soup). Too many flavors can't be fixed. Thin it with plain water or stock, and serve in small amounts with condiments (bread crumbs, boiled egg bits, bacon bits, nuts, fresh herbs, etc.)
Breads and baked good are ruined if they burn, fall (fail to rise or over-rise) or are undercooked and wet inside. Usually these can't be saved. Try slicing off the burned edges and see if the rest tastes ok. Bread that falls can only be eaten as is, used as crumbs or in a pudding, or thrown away. Undercooked cakes can be returned to the oven if they are still hot. (see recipes for bread puddings)

Use the proper amount of yeast for your recipe.,
Activate the yeast, if necessary.,
Mix and knead the dough.,
Let the dough rise in a warm place.,
Punch the dough and let it rise again.",How to Rise Bread1," When it comes to bread baking, adding yeast is the surest way to get bread to rise. When you mix flour, water and yeast together, the yeast releases enzymes that break down the flour into simple sugars. The yeast consumes the sugars and produces carbon dioxide and ethyl alcohol. As a result, air bubbles form in the dough, helping it rise to tall, fluffy heights.When you don't add enough yeast, the dough is unable to rise properly. Make sure you use the exact amount called for in the recipe you're using. For example, this recipe for white sandwich bread calls for 2 1/4s teaspoon yeast. It's not much, but it's just enough to make the dough rise correctly.
On the other hand, using too much yeast will negatively affect the flavor of the bread.;
, Most bread recipes call for either instant yeast or what's called active dried yeast. Instant yeast can be added directly to flour and other dry ingredients. Active dry yeast, on the other hand, must be ""activated"" before you can mix it in with the rest of the ingredients. This prepares the yeast to release the enzymes required to help the dough rise. To activate yeast,


Measure out the amount of yeast the recipe calls for. The recipe may instruct you to mix the yeast with a certain amount of either warm water or warm milk. Make sure the liquid is not to cold or hot, or the yeast won't activate.
Wait for the mixture to start bubbling. It should take anywhere between two and five minutes. When the yeast bubbles, you know it's ""live,"" meaning it will rise your dough. If it never bubbles, the yeast may be old. You'll have to use different yeast.
If a recipe calls for instant yeast, but you only have live active yeast, you can make a substitution. Measure out the amount of yeast called for. Mix it with a small amount of water subtracted from the total amount of water to be added later in the recipe. This will ensure the moisture of the dough is correct., Follow the instructions in your recipe to mix the dough and knead it well. In most cases you will be instructed to knead for 10 minutes, using either your hands or the dough hook attachment on your mixer. Kneading the dough helps to distribute the yeast thoroughly. Kneading also causes the dough to glutenize and become stretchy. This will help it rise more effectively and result in a delicious chewy texture.


When you're finished kneading the dough, it should form easily into a ball that doesn't fall apart. The dough should barely stick to the sides of the bowl you're using.
If the dough falls apart or is extremely sticking, you need to add either more water or more flour. The texture of the dough is important at this stage.

, After kneading, the next step is usually to let the dough rise. Place the ball of dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover it with plastic wrap or a dishcloth. Put the bowl in a warm spot in your kitchen to wait for it to double in size. Look for a spot that isn't close to doors or open windows. The warmer the spot, the faster the dough will rise.


If you can't find a good warm spot in your kitchen, preheat the oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit, then turn it off. Place the bowl in the oven and keep the oven door slightly ajar. This warm environment is the perfect place for dough to rise.
If the dough is kept at a cooler temperature, it may take extra time to rise. Even if your recipe says you should let the dough rise for an hour, you don't actually want to stop letting it rise until it has doubled in size, no matter how long it takes.

, After the first rise, many recipes will instruct you to shape the dough, then let it rise again. Punch it down, then knead it for the instructed amount of time. Shape the dough into a loaf, then prepare it for a second rise. The second rise will ensure that the finished bread is deliciously fluffy and light, so don't skip this step.


Put the dough in a loaf pan, divide it into rolls, or otherwise shape it according to the recipe you're following.
The second rise should be conducted like the first one. Cover the dough, put in a warm spot, and let it rise until it has doubled in size.

Make a wild yeast starter.,
Feed the starter.,
Feed the starter for two more days.,
Divide the starter to use in a recipe.,
Refrigerate the remaining starter for future use.",How to Rise Bread2," Using commercial yeast is the easy way to make bread rise, but it wasn't always available. Before commercial yeast was made, people created dough ""starters"" using wild yeasts that are naturally carried through the air and found in flour and other foods. Wild yeast has a delicious sour flavor, lending sourdough bread its name. To make a wild yeast starter, do the following:


Mix equal amounts of white flour and water. 4 ounces all-purpose flour and 4 ounces water creates a good starter base. Mix until the ingredients form a thick dough.
Place the starter in a large jar or glass bowl covered with cheesecloth or loose plastic wrap.
Store it in a warm place in your kitchen. It should be kept between 70 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Store for 24 hours., After 24 hours, you should see small bubbles forming on the surface of the dough. That means wild yeast has found its way into the jar and begun to metabolize the flour to produce carbon dioxide and ethyl alcohol, which is exactly what you want. Now it's time to feed the starter to keep the process going. To feed the starter,


Mix 4 ounces all-purpose flour and 4 ounces water to form a thick dough.
Pour it into the starter mixture and stir well.
Recover the jar with cheesecloth or loose plastic wrap.
Store it in a warm place in your kitchen. It should be kept between 70 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Store for another 24 hours., On the third day, mix another 4 ounces of flour and 4 ounces of water to add to the starter. Let it sit in a warm place for another 24 hours. On the fourth day, repeat the process one more time: mix 4 ounces of flour and 4 ounces of water, then add it to the starter. Store it in a warm place for 24 more hours.


By the morning of the third day, the starter should have large and small bubbles and a yeasty smell. It should look visibly larger in size.
By the morning of the fourth day, it should be bubbly and smell quite yeasty. It should have doubled in size.
By the morning of the fifth day, after the starter has rested for the remaining 24 hours, it should fill the jar. The texture should be loose and slippery. The starter should be filled with bubbles and frothy.
If your starter isn't big, bubbly and yeasty by now, try storing it in a different place. Make sure the temperature is sufficiently warm. Keep feeding the starter for as many days as it takes to ripen into a bubbly, frothy concoction.

, Now that the starter is ""ripe,"" you can use it in place of commercial yeast in a recipe. Most recipes for sourdough bread call for mixing about a cup of starter with several cups of flour, water and other ingredients. Follow the bread recipe to make your bread rise properly.After mixing the starter with the other ingredients, knead the dough for the instructed amount of time.
Place it in a loosely covered bowl and let it rest in a warm area to rise.
When the dough has doubled in size, punch it, shape it and let it rise a second time before baking.

, Save at least 1/2 cup of starter to use next time you want to bake bread. Instead of making a new starter from scratch, you can feed your existing starter until it ripens again. Store it in a clean glass jar with a lid, and refrigerate until you're ready to prep it for more bread.When you're ready to use the starter, let it warm to room temperature. Feed the starter with a mixture of 4 ounces of flour and four ounces of water.
Let the starter sit in a warm area for 24 hours. During this time, it should bubble and double in size.
When the starter is ripe, divide it and use what you need for your bread recipe. Store the remaining starter for future use.

Make sure the yeast you use is new.,
Try placing the mixing bowl in a tray of warm water.,
Try using white flour instead of whole grain.,
Use a loaf pan of the correct size.,
Achieve the right dough moisture level.,
Make sure the dough isn't too salty.",How to Rise Bread3," Expired yeast, or yeast that has been sitting out, may never fully activate. That's why yeast often comes in individual packets that you tear open as you need them. Check the expiration date on your yeast to make sure it should still be active.


Store your yeast in a dry, cool area to prevent it from going bad in between uses.
If you're using wild yeast starter and the starter won't seem to activate, you can place a pinch of commercial yeast in the mixture to keep things going.

, If you have a lot of trouble achieving the right temperature in your kitchen, you can try a warm water bath. Place the bowl with the dough in a baking tray that has been filled with warm water. Change out the water occasionally to keep it at the same warm temperature.Don't make the mistake of ""cooking"" your yeast by using water that's too hot. It should be warm, but not scalding, or the yeast will die before it causes your bread to rise.
Depending on the conditions in your kitchen, you may just need to have some patience. Try letting the bread rise overnight instead of the recommended four or six hours to see if that makes a difference.

, Bread made with white flour tends to rise higher than bread made with whole wheat and other heavier flours. If you want fluffy, spongy bread, white flour is the way to go. If you love the taste of whole wheat flour, try, using a half and half mixture of each so you get both the height and the flavor you desire.

, It's important to use the specific pan the recipe you're following instructs you to use. If you use one that's a little too big, the dough will rise from side to side instead of upward. The result will be a flatter loaf of bread that may not rise over the sides of the pan.

, Dough that is too dry won't rise as well as dough that is moist and soft. If your dough feels a little hard and dry after kneading, add an extra tablespoon or two of water to soften it. Cover the bowl you're storing it in with a washcloth dampened with warm water. This will prevent a crust from forming over the dough as it rises., High salt content can prevent bread from rising correctly. Be sure you use only the amount of salt that the recipe calls for. Extra salt may cause your bread to come out flat and hard."

,









Make sure to have a lid that will cover the pan.

,,,









This will steam the fat and allow the fatty liquid to be extracted out of the fat chunks.

,,









The fatty liquid will start to darken during this part of the process as it renders.

,,









A wire mesh strainer works best for this. The small holes in the mesh help to trap any chunks and solid bits of chicken meat.

,









Rendered fat can be stored in the refrigerator for several weeks, or frozen for 3 to 4 months.

Replace some of the oversalted liquid.,
Add acid or sugar.,
Increase the recipe size.,
Serve over starch.,
Rinse salty vegetables.,
Serve at a higher temperature.",How to Remedy Oversalted Cooking1," If you are making a soup, curry, or other liquid dish, the easiest option is to add more liquid. Pour out some of the salty liquid and discard it. Add water, unsalted broth, or milk, depending on the dish., Adding a completely new ingredient is a bold move, but can have high rewards. Acidic and sweet flavors are great choices to complement or obscure saltiness.Acidic ingredients work with almost any dish. Try citrus juice, vinegar, wine, tomato, or pickled foods.Besides plain sugar, you could add honey or condensed milk. This works best in combination with acid. Try adding 1 teaspoon (5mL) each of sugar and cider vinegar, then repeat until perfect., If you have the time and pantry supplies, add more ingredients. For instance, add more meat and vegetables to your stew, or unsalted butter to your sauce. This will reduce the ratio of salt to other flavors. This is the only way to fix an oversalted dough.


If you prefer more neutral flavors, grind cauliflower to a fine consistency and mix it into the liquid.

, You can add rice, pasta, or potatoes to almost any dish. Starch is not a special counter to sugar, but it is an easy way to increase the recipe size.


Don't believe the myth about letting a potato absorb salt from a broth, then throwing it away. The potato absorbs liquid as well as salt. The percentage of salt remains unchanged., Partially boiled vegetables can be rinsed and returned to less salty water. Rinsing can ruin the texture and flavor of steamed, baked, or stir-fried veggies, but may work if you catch the mistake soon after you begin cooking.

, Temperature affects taste in complex ways, but a cold dish can taste saltier than a hot one.If warming the dish isn't an option, consider serving it with a hot drink like coffee or tea instead.


This is a fairly minor effect. Combine it with other solutions.

Switch to kosher salt.,
Salt your food from higher up.,
Salt in small amounts throughout the recipe.,
Plan around reducing liquid.",How to Remedy Oversalted Cooking2," The tiny grains of table salt clump tumble quickly out of the shaker, easily over-salting the dish. The larger crystals of kosher salt are much easier to control. You will need a larger volume to get the same flavor, since kosher salt is more loosely packed.Stick to table salt for baking. You need small crystals to dissolve in dough., When sprinkling on salt, hold your fingers about 10 inches (25cm) above the food. The salt will spread more evenly across the dish. Your guests will appreciate the lack of salty clumps., Salt a little at the time, every time you add a new (non-salty) ingredient. Taste frequently to keep track of how the flavor is developing. It's much easier to adjust halfway through the process than five minutes before serving time.

, Remember that the soup you're seasoning will be a lot stronger after the water's boiled away for half an hour. Go light on the salt at first, and add more to taste once the soup is closer to its final volume.

Check the skin on the chiles.,
Place the chiles in a sturdy plastic bag when they are done roasting.,
Peel the skin away from the chile.",How to Roast Hatch Chiles2,", Make sure you do not overcrowd the chiles or they will not roast properly. Each chile should have room to stretch out on the hot pan.

, Use tongs to flip them over to the other side.


Hold the chiles to the heat with a wooden spoon if they begin to curl up. The heat can cause them to contract, so it is important to keep the skin on the heat.

, When they are black or dark brown and beginning to blister, you know they are done.

, Close the bag and allow the steam to moisten the skin on the chiles.


Leave the chiles in the bag until they cool down. Once they are cool, take them out of the bag.

Use flour with any substance that also combines a fat.",How to Use Thickeners in Cooking1," This is why flour is often used to make gravy or a roux. The following are common ways to use flour to thicken recipes.


Make a roux by melting 1 oz. (30 ml) of butter in a saucepan placed over medium heat. Add 1 oz. (28 g) of flour and stir continuously until the mixture is brown. The longer a roux is browned, the richer the flavor becomes. Take the pan off the stove and whisk in the half pint of animal stock. Whisk vigorously; place it back on the heat to boil. It should boil for at least 2 minutes.
Make a ""beurre manie,"" a common French cooking thickener. Learn how to here:make beurre manie.

Mix equal parts flour with cold water. You can purchase canisters that allow you to easily shake these 2 substances together. Make sure there aren't any lumps before you add this to the gravy. Lumps can be removed by whisking until they are gone. Proceed to whisking the thickener into the gravy.
Both flour and cornstarch start to thicken between 144 and 162° F (62 to 72° C). They usually complete their thickening just after boiling at 205° F (96° C). Sauces that are thickened with flour may not remain stably thick. They can lose thickness if frozen, thawed or overcooked.;

Create an appetizer by covering crostini, or toasted bread, with a thin layer of provolone cheese.,
Add a small amount of oregano along with basil and other herbs to steamed seafood dishes, such as mussels and clams.",How to Use Oregano in Cooking," Wash the leaves thoroughly before using them. Take the leaves in your hands and roll them between your palms to crush them and release the natural oils, and them place them in the recipe.


If you are creating a ""bouquet garni,"" wash the oregano plant with the leaves on the stems. Tie the oregano to thyme, basil, parsley, rosemary, tarragon and/or bay leaves with a string. Drop it in a stock mixture and allow it to simmer until all the flavors are imparted into the mixture.
The term ""bouquet garni"" means garnished bouquet. It is sometimes sold in a dried mixture in western supermarkets.;
, Oregano pairs very well with tomatoes and other Mediterranean herbs, such as basil. Add the oregano toward the end of the cooking process to help maximize its natural flavor.


Experiment by adding 1 tsp. (0.6 g) of fresh oregano or 1 tsp. (0.5 g) of dried oregano to your pasta or pizza sauces. Raise or lower the dose based on your preference.

, (0.25 g) of dried oregano or 1/2 tsp. (0.3 g) of fresh oregano to a vinaigrette to create an Italian or Greek-style vinaigrette. Serve it on a bed of fresh greens with tomatoes, cucumbers, Kalamata olives and feta cheese.

, These include olive oil, vinegar, garlic, basil, onion, parsley and thyme. They make an excellent marinade for lamb, beef or chicken.

, Marjoram is a type of oregano and thyme has a similar flavor, so they can be used to almost the same culinary effect.


Marjoram is a type of the genus oregano, called origanum majorana. There are more than 50 types of oregano, and all of these plants are part of the mint family. Marjoram tends to have a more subtle flavor, so feel free to use it to replace the stronger taste, if you prefer it.

, You may also want to add it earlier in stewed dishes with these strong-flavored vegetables. Both the vegetable and the herb pair well with olive oil.

, Mexican oregano has a milder, less bitter, flavor than Greek oregano. Also add oregano with chile when you are creating stewed beans.

, Sprinkle fresh, diced oregano leaves on top of the cheese and place in the grill or broiler for 5 minutes. Serve immediately.

, It also can be used to marinade and flavor seafood, but you should use it in low amounts because of its somewhat bitter taste.

Use cornstarch when thickening any filling or sauce that does not have an acidic substance in it.",How to Use Thickeners in Cooking2," For example, any recipe that includes vinegar or lemon juice would not respond well to a cornstarch thickener. It is especially useful in recipes with milk and eggs, such as custard.


Add 1/4 tbsp. (2.4 g) of cornstarch to 1 cup (237 ml) of liquid to use cornstarch as a thickener. Mix it well with cold liquid before adding it into a hot recipe. Add the cornstarch mixture slowly as you bring the mixture to a simmer. Whisk constantly during this process.
Cornstarch does not stand up very well to freezing or overcooking.

Use arrowroot flour or starch when thickening on low heat or with an acid.",How to Use Thickeners in Cooking3," Arrowroot is a tuber that grows in warm climates, which is reduced to a pulp to create a starch. It is especially useful for fruit pies, but does not work well with dairy products.


Add an even amount of arrowroot with cold water or broth and mix well before adding to the substance.

Use tapioca as a last minute thickener.,
Choose tapioca starch to thicken pies or stews.",How to Use Thickeners in Cooking4," The powder thickens quickly on low temperatures. Take care to use a small amount at a time.


If your dish will be frozen, use tapioca instead of cornstarch or flour. It will retain its thick texture.

, Tapioca pearls are generally used to create tapioca pudding, which retain small balls of starchy tapioca.


You can use instant tapioca to thicken pies if you grind it first in a food processor.

Choose unsweetened chocolate over semi-sweet chocolate to make a thick chocolate sauce or ganache.,
Use cream to thicken and fatten a sauce.,
Temper egg yolks to use them as a thickener.,
Use gelatin or pectin according to package directions.",How to Use Thickeners in Cooking6," Add sweetener later and you will have a rich sauce.

, If you prefer to leave some of the fat out of a cream-based recipe, you can use evaporated milk with a cornstarch thickener. Yogurt is also used in certain soups and sauces to create a creamy base, near the end of cooking process.

, This is a temperamental thickener because the substance can easily curdle and should not be heated over 190° F (88° C). Add hot liquid to the egg yolks slowly as you whip them, then whisk it into the hot liquid after the mixture is tempered.

, These are found in the supermarket and they are used to form thick, gelatinous deserts or jams.

Drink it.,
Curb your appetite and lose weight.,
Use it to cook meat, poultry, or fish.,
Mix it into a broth or soup.,
Boil rice or pasta in tomato juice.,
Make a thin sauce.,
Create your own salad dressing.,
Tone down or enhance a salsa or chili sauce.,
Freeze it for another day.,
Use tomato juice to reduce foul, stubborn food odors.",How to Use Tomato Juice1," Tomatoes contain several beneficial minerals and vitamins, including potassium, lycopene, and vitamins C, A, and B6. As any antioxidant, lycopene is especially beneficial and consistent ingestion can help ward off various cancers and heart disease.


If the taste of tomato juice does not appeal to you on its own, you can mix it with other fruit and vegetable juices, like cucumber, carrot, celery or apple juice.
You can also create a spiced tomato drink by mixing it with brown sugar and spices like cinnamon and allspice.;
, Hunger is often intensified by thirst. Tomatoes have a high water content, so a glass of tomato juice can help curb your appetite. Drinking tomato juice ten minutes before you eat can greatly reduce your hunger.


Additionally, tomatoes contain fewer calories than the body uses to digest them, so drinking a glass of tomato juice can actually help you burn calories and lose weight.

, Instead of using water or broth to stew or braise a tough cut of meat, substitute the liquid for tomato juice. Tomato juice has more acid in it than water and broth, so it helps to break down the toughness of the meat or poultry while adding flavor.

Due to its acidity, tomato juice also makes a good marinade for fish and poultry. The juice has less acidity than lemon juice, though, which makes it a good alternative for someone looking for a marinade with less acid in it.







, Many kinds of soup, from plain tomato soup to gazpacho, use tomato juice as a base. Even if a hearty soup recipe does not call for tomato juice, however, you can still substitute part of the broth or water with tomato juice to give your soup another dimension of flavor.

, Rice and pasta are typically boiled in water, but you can add a hint of tomato taste by boiling these starches in tomato juice. You can either replace the water with tomato juice completely or blend a little tomato juice into the water you usually use for a milder taste. Both pasta and rice absorb flavor as they cook, so boiling them in even a small amount of tomato juice infuses them with the taste of tomatoes.

, Tomato juice is a little too thin to make a standard spaghetti sauce, but you can still use it to create a slightly thinner, low-calorie sauce for pasta, vegetables, and poultry. Flavor the juice with Italian spices, like oregano, garlic, and basil, and thicken it up a little by adding around 1 teaspoon (4.8 grams) of cornstarch for every 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of juice.

, By mixing the tomato juice with a little olive oil and vinegar, you can create a flavorful dressing to pour over leafy salads. Mixing in other ingredients like basil, garlic, paprika, and lemon juice will create a thin dressing with a taste that is reminiscent of French or Catalina dressings.

, If a salsa or tomato-based sauce is a little too spicy for your liking, you can cool it down a bit by mixing in some plain tomato juice. The spicy ""kick"" will be toned down, but in return, the tomato flavor will be enhanced., If you have more tomato juice than you can use, pour it into an ice cube tray and freeze it. You can use the tomato juice ice to add extra flavor to vegetable juices, or you can save it for about three to four months in the freezer. Once you have another need for tomato juice, thaw as much as you need and use it however you want.

, Tomato juice can be used to clean plastic containers with a potent odor. Pour a little tomato juice onto a dish sponge and wipe the inside of the container before washing it with warm water and dish soap. The acid in the tomato juice helps to strip away odor-causing bacteria. After drying the container, keep it inside of the freezer for a few days.


You can use the same method to cut down on odors in your refrigerator or freezer. Pour tomato juice onto a dish sponge or washcloth and scrub out the refrigerator or freezer. Rinse the appliance with warm water and soap before wiping it dry with a dish towel.

Select the right kind of coconut oil.,
Start slowly.,
Add the other ingredients at room temperature.,
Prepare yourself for possible chunks of oil.,
Substitute coconut oil when you want to cook at high temperatures.,
Use less coconut oil than butter.If you plan on using coconut oil in place of butter, use 25 percent less oil than butter.,
Prepare to experiment.",How to Use Coconut Oil1," The two main types of coconut oil are refined and extra virgin. Generally, extra virgin coconut oil is considered healthier since the coconuts used to make it are either dried using a sanitary method and pressed using a machine, or fermented and juiced using gravity. Refined coconut oil is usually smoked or dried using less sanitary methods, and as a result, it has to be bleached and deodorized.


Refined oil does have a less potent coconut taste, though, and might be easier to adjust to for people who are not used to using coconut oil for cooking. If you buy a refined oil for this reason, choose a high quality oil that is naturally refined and unbleached.;
, Since extra virgin coconut oil does give food a slight coconut taste, it may take a while before you and those you cook for get used to it. Introduce the taste gradually by using the oil to cook foods that will be complemented by the taste of coconut. You can also mix the oil with other types of oil in a recipe to dilute it as you adjust to the taste.

, This is especially important if you are using coconut oil in liquid form. Since coconut oil is naturally solid at room temperature, adding cold ingredients to it will cause it to start re-solidifying, creating chunks. For that reason, it is best to use room temperature or slightly warm ingredients.

, Even if you melt the coconut oil beforehand and only add room temperature ingredients to it, there is still some chance that parts of the coconut oil will turn into small, solid chunks. If the batter or recipe is not especially sensitive, you can usually continue cooking without much problem even if a few chunks form. For more sensitive batters, however, you might need to heat the ingredients over a double boiler up to 76 degrees Fahrenheit (24.4 degrees Celsius) or you can try whipping the batter in a blender to disperse the chunks.

, Since coconut oil has a higher smoking point than olive oil or other vegetable oils, it can tolerate higher levels of heat. As a result, it makes an excellent choice for sautéing and stir-frying foods.


Generally, refined coconut oil can tolerate heat up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232.2 degrees Celsius) and extra virgin coconut oil can tolerate heat up to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176.7 degrees Celsius). If the oil begins to blacken or produce a lot of smoke, though, it has likely been overheated.

, Coconut oil is nearly pure fat, while butter is not. If the recipe needs the extra moisture usually provided by the full amount of butter, you can add a dash of additional liquid, like milk or water.

, For the most part, you can substitute coconut oil for many other oils and fats without incident, but since it does have slightly different properties, you may stumble upon a recipe for which it does not work as a perfect substitution. You can usually use the oil in these recipes, but you may need to experiment with it a few times until you can figure out the appropriate proportions.

Cool sunburns.,
Make your skin glow.,
Condition your hair.",How to Use Tomato Juice2," The regular application of tomato juice to your face can shrink your pores, leading to a clearer complexion.


For maximum effectiveness, mix about 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of fresh tomato juice with 2 to 4 drops of fresh lime or lemon juice. Apply this solution to your face using a sterile cotton ball, gently massaging it in small circles. Leave the solution on your face for 5 to 15 minutes before rinsing it off with cool to lukewarm water.

, Tomato juice can be used to dry out oil on your skin. Before applying the juice, mix it with equal parts cucumber juice. Cucumbers hydrate your skin, which will prevent it from becoming dry and flaky once you strip the oils using the tomato juice. Use a cotton ball to apply the mix onto the oiliest parts of your face each day.

, Tomato juice can neutralize and cool the skin, and the lycopene in tomatoes can help shield the skin against UV light rays.

Mix about 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of tomato juice with 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) plain yogurt. Apply the mask to any part of your skin that caught a little too much sun and leave it on for about 20 minutes before washing it off with cool to lukewarm water. The yogurt works with the tomato to return lost protein to your skin, making it softer.
Applying a mixture made with 2 tablespoons tomato juice and 4 tablespoons buttermilk can accomplish the same goal. Leave this concoction on your sunburnt skin for 30 minutes before rinsing it off with cool to lukewarm water.

, The vitamin A and vitamin C in tomato juice can help brighten a dull complexion. Mix enough honey into the tomato juice to form a thick paste, and then apply this paste onto your face. Allow it to dry for about 15 minutes before washing it off with a gentle cleanser and warm water.

, The vitamins in tomato juice can also add the natural shine back to dull, lifeless hair.

Apply a small amount of tomato juice to your scalp and hair after you wash it with shampoo.
Leave it in for 3 to 5 minutes before rinsing it out, as you might do with a conditioner.
The tomato juice should increase the acidic pH of your hair, allowing it to regain some of its vibrancy.

Melt solid coconut oil before measuring it out.If you plan on using coconut oil as a substitute for another type of oil, it is generally best to melt it into a liquid form to ensure that you get an equal and accurate measurement.,
Use the microwave to melt the coconut oil.,
Melt the entire jar in warm water.,
Heat a portion of oil on the stove.",How to Use Coconut Oil2," Melting the oil also helps it to distribute more evenly into the mix of ingredients.


The exception to this rule is when you use coconut oil as a substitute for another solid fat, like shortening or butter. In these instances, you can measure it out in solid form.

, You can either melt a small portion or the whole container, as long as the container is microwave-safe.


To microwave a portion, scoop out an amount that is approximately the same amount you will need for cooking. Microwave it in 15 second intervals, stirring in between each one until it is completely melted. Measure it out in liquid form and melt additional oil if necessary.
To microwave in the jar, place the entire jar in the microwave in 30 second intervals, stirring in between each one until completely melted. Measure out what you need and allow the rest to re-solidify.

, If the container is not microwave-safe, you can still melt the entire jar by sticking it in a bowl of hot water until it liquefies. Afterward, measure out what you need and let the remainder re-solidify. Coconut oil can be safely melted many times.

, Instead of microwaving a portion of coconut oil to melt it, you can heat it in a small pot over low heat, stirring constantly, until it turns liquid. Measure out what you need and melt more oil if needed.

Cut medium to large carrots into thin slices, lengthwise strips, or quarter-inch cubes. Steam or boil them for two minutes before freezing them.

, Remove the leaves and stems of the carrot tops – but don’t wash, cut or peel the carrots. Place the carrots in sand, dry soil, or half sand and half wood shavings. Don’t allow the carrots to touch each other. Put them in a cool, dark place.Only store undamaged carrots this way. Don’t use carrots that are bruised or nicked. Check them occasionally while they’re in storage, and remove any rotting, bruised or softened carrots.Store carrots at 32-42°F (0-5.5 °C) and 90-95% humidity for up to four to six months."

Remove sticker residue.",How to Use Peanut Oil," In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, salt, and pepper. Slowly drizzle in the peanut oil. Continue whisking until the marinade becomes slightly thick and the oil and vinegar are combined. Stir in the onion and garlic.Use this sauce to marinate:

Steak
Chicken
Tofu
Fish
Vegetables;
, Combine all the ingredients in a blender or food processor. Pulse the ingredients together until they form a smooth dressing and there are no chunks of onion or garlic left, about one to two minutes. Transfer the dressing to a squeeze bottle or easy-to-pour container. Use 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of dressing per serving of salad.

Store leftover dressing in the refrigerator for up to two weeks., Pulse the peanuts in a food processor for one to two minutes, until they are coarsely ground. Heat the peanut oil and curry paste for one minute in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring constantly. Whisk in the peanuts, coconut milk, and sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil, whisking constantly. Remove the pan from the heat. Whisk in the soy sauce and lime juice.Serve the peanut sauce hot, or refrigerate it immediately and use it within two to three days.
Peanut sauce is a versatile ingredient that you can serve with meat, tofu, stir fries, vegetables, noodles, and rice, or added to soups and other dishes.

, Use a food processor or blender to pulse the nuts for 30 seconds to chop them roughly. Set aside half the nuts to make chunky peanut butter. Process the remaining nuts for three minutes, stopping every minute to scrape down the sides. After three minutes, add the remaining ingredients and process for another two minutes.To make chunky peanut butter, add the chopped nut pieces back to the smooth peanut butter and stir to combine.
Transfer the peanut butter to an airtight container for storage.

, Deep fryers typically cook foods at 350 to 375 F (177 to 191 C), and the smoke point of peanut oil is 450 F (232 C). This means you can use peanut oil to deep fry all your favorite foods, and you won’t burn the oil. Peanut oil also has a neutral taste, so your food won’t taste like peanuts.Foods you can fry with this oil include:


Turkeys
French fries
Battered vegetables
Fish
Chicken

, Stir frying is the process of cooking small pieces of food quickly at a high temperature in a small amount of oil. Peanut oil is ideal for this type of cooking because of its high smoke point and neutral flavor. To stir fry any type of food:Heat a wok or skillet over medium heat
Add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of peanut oil
When the oil is shimmering, add chopped garlic, onion, and other aromatics
Cook for 30 seconds to a minute
Add bite-sized pieces of meat or vegetables and cook for five to seven minutes, stirring constantly
Add your favorite sauces
Serve warm

, Roasted vegetables are a great addition to any meal. To help the vegetables stay moist and to give them some extra flavor, oil is drizzled over them before roasting. Peanut oil is a great roasting option because it won’t burn and won’t overpower the flavor of the vegetables. Vegetables you can roast with peanut oil include:

Potatoes
Onions
Carrots
Parsnips
Asparagus
Beans
Brussels sprouts
Zucchini

, Peanut oil will keep longest when it’s protected from air, sunlight, heat, and moisture. For a shelf life up to nine months, store peanut oil in an airtight container, and keep the bottle somewhere that’s cool, dry, and dark.A cool pantry is an ideal place for peanut oil.

, Like most oils, peanut oil can be used to moisturize dry skin and sooth itchy, flaking skin. Pour a teaspoon (5 ml) of peanut oil into the palm of your hand and massage the oil into dry areas of skin.Peanut oil can also be used to moisturize a dry scalp. Massage the oil into your scalp for about 10 minutes. Rinse your scalp with warm water and dry your hair.
Avoid using peanut oil on your face. The high fat content could cause pimples.

, You can make a quick an easy homemade furniture polish by combining 1 cup (235 ml) of peanut oil with ½ cup (118 ml) of fresh lemon juice. Transfer the mixture to a spray bottle. To use the spray:Shake the bottle well
Spray a clean lint-free cloth with a small amount of the solution
Rub and polish wood and laminate furniture with the damp cloth
Wipe the area with a clean cloth

, Peanut oil and peanut butter are great for removing glue and sticker residue from surfaces. Scrape away as much of the sticker as possible. Use a clean cloth to saturate the residue with peanut oil. Let the oil soak for about five minutes, and then scrape away the residue. Wipe the area clean with soapy water before rinsing and drying the surface."

Try coconut oil in Thai and Indian food.The flavor of coconut is used frequently in Thai and Indian cuisine, and as such, the mild coconut flavor of coconut oil naturally complements the other flavors in these types of dishes.,
Use coconut oil in baked goods.,
Look up recipes that specifically call for coconut oil.,
Add coconut oil into beverages.,
Drizzle melted coconut oil over popcorn.,
Consider the potential uses and benefits outside of cooking:


As a body and facial moisturizer

As natural deodorant

As a supplement: take two teaspoons a day to speed weight loss, improve sleeping habits, help with mental alertness, and increase milk supply if you're breastfeeding.",How to Use Coconut Oil3," You can use coconut oil in other types of cuisine, as well, but the flavor may clash more frequently than it will with Thai or Indian cuisine.

, If you are going for a more traditional flavor with a particular baked good, like chocolate chip cookies or red velvet cake, it might be best to skip the coconut oil. For added depth of flavor, though, you can replace part or all of the fat called for in a baked good recipe with coconut oil. Since extra virgin coconut oil also tends to be a little sweet, you can also reduce the amount of sugar used in the recipe.


Chilled coconut oil works especially well when used in place of butter for pie crusts and similar dough.

, Even though it can be used as a substitute for other fats, there are also a number of recipes for which coconut oil is the first choice. These recipes usually include dessert recipes, like frostings, ice creams, candies, and puddings, but there are some savory recipes that call for coconut oil, too. Examples include bean dishes and soups.

, A small dash of extra virgin coconut oil added to a smoothie, tea, eggnog, or hot chocolate is enough to provide you with the benefits coconut oil offers along with a mild hint of coconut flavor.

, Extra virgin coconut oil has a sweet taste that is reminiscent of golden or brown butter. As such, it can be drizzled over popcorn and other foods for which you might usually drizzle with butter.

,
As a deep conditioning hair mask

As part of your beauty regime: as makeup remover, eye cream, night cream, DIY foot/body/hand scrub (mixed with salt or sugar), a face mask, shaving cream, massage oil, face wash (mixed with olive oil), lip conditioner, lip balm, cuticle cream, or hand cream.

Measure out your ingredients.,
Try substituting for unsweetened baking chocolate.,
Or try substituting semisweet chocolate.,
Alternatively, use cocoa to substitute for sweet baking chocolate.,
Mix it in with the liquid already in the recipe.,
Make a chocolate ganache.,
Make chocolate whipped cream.,
Make chocolate frosting.,
Make vegan chocolate frosting.",How to Use Cocoa as a Chocolate Substitute," Each substitution is a little different – make sure you know what kind of chocolate your recipe needs. For the record, bittersweet and semi-sweet chocolate can be used interchangeably. As they are pretty much the same, only different names. If you're trying to substitute for chocolate chips, you may be fighting an uphill battle. It won't taste the same as you're envisioning, but it is technically possible. To work backwards, a 12 oz bag of chocolate chips is 2 cups. 1 oz of baking chocolate is usually 1 or 2 squares.
If using butter or margarine, soften it before beginning.;
, Combine 3 tablespoons cocoa powder with 1 tablespoon of butter, margarine or vegetable oil. Mix it up until it's a uniform consistency. This will make the equivalent of 1 ounce of unsweetened baking chocolate.This is to make unsweetened baking chocolate. If you're using sweetened cocoa, the taste will not be the same – it'll be much, much sweeter.

, Combine 1 tablespoon cocoa, 3 1/2 tsp sugar, and 2 tsp shortening (butter, margarine, or vegetable oil work, too), mixing well. This will make the equivalent of 1 ounce of semisweet chocolate. You could try it instead of chocolate chips, but it will more like a semi-sweet chocolate cookie than anything.


This recipe works for bittersweet chocolate, too.

, Combine 4 tsp sugar, 3 tbsp cocoa, and 1 tbsp vegetable shortening.This will make the equivalent of 1 ounce of sweet baking chocolate when mixed up well.


Again, be wary of using this in a chocolate chip cookie as this is not in chip form.

, If you're unsure of what to do with your cocoa-sugar-shortening mixture, just add it into your bowl full of wet ingredients. It'll mix right in, no harm, no foul.


It can also work drizzled on top and then put into the oven. It's best to avoid using it as a dipping sauce, however.

, Who knew that such a fancy word like ""ganache"" was really just chocolate and cream? Don't be fooled – this is not an intimidating recipe.


For this one, you'll need to multiply the above by 12 (to get 12 ounces of chocolate). Just remember that there are 3 teaspoons per every tablespoon; that's just about all the math there is.

, If you're skeptical of substituting out chocolate for cocoa in an actual recipe, why not try it in your topping? That way your dessert won't be compromised if it all turns out less than desirable. And, really, how bad can chocolate whipped cream be, cocoa or not?


And the best about this substitution is that cocoa is already in powder form – no need to bust out the food processor; it's already done for you.

, Alright, so this recipe doesn't require chocolate per se – it actually just requires cocoa from the get-go. But it's an easy recipe to see that cocoa is delicious and you don't need chocolate to make something adequately chocolate-y and convincing.


The article above has four different varieties of chocolate. There's even a dairy-free version (which cocoa totally is). Score.

, Alright, so dairy-free wasn't enough? You want a chocolate frosting that's healthier, too? Challenge accepted with this recipe. Grapeseed oil and agave nectar instead of vegetable oil or sugar, and dark chocolate instead of regular chocolate. And yes, dark chocolate cocoa powder is a thing.


Cocoa is great to use for most diets. It's practically no-carb and dairy free – what's not to like?

Finished.

",How to Use a Crock Pot," Wash the interior ceramic section and the top glass portion with dish soap and warm water.;
, Your slow cooker emits heat, so safety is a priority. Make sure there is plenty of room on all sides, including the top, to vent off the heat for the duration of cooking.


You can store your clean slow cooker in a cupboard when it is unplugged. If you choose to do this, you should clear space every time you remove it for use.

, Older crock pots may not automatically use this setting after the time is finished.

, Different brands of slow cooker have slightly different settings and cleaning instructions.

,


Find a recipe that is made for a slow cooker. You can find cookbooks or online recipes that list the heat and cooking times along with the correct amount of ingredients. Keep in mind, that you should plan to fill at least half of your crock pot in order for slow cooking times to be correct for the recipe. If you have a very large or small slow cooker, you may want to change the portions. Most recipes are intended for 5 to 6 qt. (4.7 to 5.7l) slow cookers.
Find a normal recipe intended for dry heat and adjust it for a slow cooker. In order to properly adjust it, you will want to cut the liquid ingredients by 1/2, because liquid does not escape from the pot. You should also place things that are roasted or baked on high heat on the ""high"" setting and things roasted or baked on lower heats on the ""low"" setting. You will need to experiment with cooking times, but cook recipes for at least 4 to 6 hours.

, You can chop vegetables or meat and make sauce the night before. This will allow you to pour the ingredients into the crock pot in the morning and set the temperature to cook all day.

, If you want smaller pieces that are firmer, add the vegetables later in the cooking time.

, Placing your meat in a hot pan with a little olive oil to brown all the sides will seal the juices inside, creating a richer flavor.


This is true with large roasts and diced meats. Ensure you cook it quickly and turn it on all sides.

, This will shorten the cook time and ensure the sauce is mixed properly.


If you prepared your ingredients the night before, pre-mix the sauce and place it in the microwave for a minute before placing it in the slow cooker.

,


Pork shoulder and chicken thighs are cheaper than breasts and chops. The long, slow cook time allows the fat to be released into the meat, making it just as tasty as more expensive cuts.
Buying more marbled cuts of meat will also keep your meat dishes from drying out.

, The long cooking times will make strong spices stronger. This is especially important if you are adjusting a regular recipe for use in a slow cooker.

, Place the cooker on the low setting to keep the temperature steady while people are opening it frequently.

, Start with the recommended cooking times and adjust later.

,, Opening it before the last 30 minutes of cooking will let the heat escape and increase the cook time.


Some experts also believe that opening the lid when cooking meat will allow bacteria to enter your kitchen. Since the crock pot keeps low heats, food, like chicken, pork or fish, that has not yet achieved a high enough heat to kill bacteria can spread bacteria on utensils, counters and floors.

, Allow the crock pot to cool down completely before cleaning.

, It is recommended that you store it in a smaller Tupperware container, so that you can clean food off the crock pot just after it cools down.


If your crock pot has a removable stoneware container, remove it from the heating portion to cool. Place it on a stove top.
If you cannot remove the inner portion of the crock pot, you must make sure the device is unplugged and cooled completely before cleaning with water.

, Crock pots should be fairly easy to clean. If there is baked on food, allow it to soak for 5 to 10 minutes in warm soapy water.


Removable stoneware containers can also be cleaned in the dishwasher.
If you have repeated problems with hard to remove food, you may be cooking the ingredients for too long.
Do not use scouring pads to clean the crock pot, or it may damage the surface.

, Wipe dry.

, Wipe dry after cleaning to reduce the likelihood of spots.

Figure out the basics of your oven.,
Use an oven thermometer.,
Rotate your trays while cooking.,
Place a baking stone on your oven's floor.,
Move items higher up for browner tops.,
Turn up the temperature for added crispiness.,
Do not use dark metal cookware.",How to Use an Oven1," Before you start attempting to use your gas oven, or any oven, read over any instruction manuals you have. This will inform you of the basics of how to turn the oven on and off as well how to move the racks and other aspects of how your oven works.Every oven comes with racks. Before using your oven, experiment with taking them in and out of the oven. Depending on what you're cooking, you may have to adjust the oven racks. It's a good idea to get a sense of how to do so.
Figure out how to turn the oven on and set the temperature. Usually, you have to turn a knob near the front of the oven to do so. You can then turn the knob to the appropriate heat setting. Some ovens give off a signal, such as light going on and off or a noise being made, indicating when the oven is adequately heated.;
, Gas ovens tend to fluctuate in temperature. Even if you set the oven for a specific temperature, the heat may rise or fall unexpectedly during the cooking process. Therefore, use an oven thermometer to measure temperature. You may need to turn the heat slightly up or slightly down during the cooking process.Use the oven light to monitor the oven's temperature. Opening the oven too often during the cooking process can cause the temperature to drop suddenly.

, Heat tends to fluctuate in a gas oven. Some spots will become hotter or colder during the cooking process. Therefore, it can help to occasionally open the oven and rotate your baking trays a few degrees to ensure things cook evenly.Cakes, breads, and muffin trays should be rotated 90 degrees halfway through cooking. If you're using more than one rack to bake something like cookies, switch the top and bottom trays as well.
Casserole dishes should be rotated slightly multiple times during the cooking process.

, A baking stone can be used to cook things like baked goods and pizzas. However, it can also help regulate temperature in a gas oven. It can help radiate temperature upward in a more even fashion. Place it on the bottom of your oven or on the lowest rack when you're not using it. Then, place whatever you're cooking just above the baking stone to help it cook more evenly., It can sometimes be hard to get things like pies to brown on the top in a gas oven. It can help to move dishes you need to brown to the top tray. This will allow them to brown faster., Gas ovens tend to be more humid, which can affect crispiness. Things like roasted potatoes may not get crisp as easily in a gas oven. It can help to turn the oven temperature up about 25 degrees hotter than the recipe calls for. This will result in a crispier final product., You should never use dark metals in a gas oven. In a gas oven, heat comes from the bottom of the oven. Dark metal cookware will absorb heat faster, which can result in the bottoms of dishes become brown or burnt.Instead of dark metal cookware, opt for light-colored metal, glass, or silicone.

Familiarize yourself with the basics.,
Give your oven extra time to preheat.,
Bake items in the middle oven rack.,
Add steam when necessary.,
Select the right bakeware for what you're cooking.",How to Use an Oven2," Make sure you read your oven's manual for the basics of using an electric oven. This should show you how to turn the oven on and off and how to do things like move the racks up and down in the oven.Make sure you know how to set the temperature. Electronic ovens usually allow you to punch in the temperature electronically and will then give an indication when the oven is ready. A light on your oven may go on or off or it may make a noise to indicate it's heated.

, Start preheating your oven while you begin preparing foods and baked goods if you're using an electronic oven. Gas ovens tend to heat quickly, but electric ovens need more time to reach the proper temperature.You should use an oven thermometer to make sure your electric oven is at the right temperature.

, Unless a recipe specifies an item should be placed on the upper or lower oven rack, always use the middle rack with an electric oven. This is the spot where the heat will be least likely to fluctuate during the cooking process. This will make your food cook more evenly throughout., Electric ovens tend to be fairly dry. Oftentimes, this can delay bread and other similar foods from rising. If you're struggling to make something like a pizza crust or loaf of bread rise, try adding a little steam to your electronic oven. You can pour a cup of hot water into a pan and then set it at the bottom of the oven. You can also open the oven a crack and use a spray bottle to spritz some water into the oven., You can use a diverse range of bakeware in an electric oven. However, different bakeware will yield different results. Make sure to use the right bakeware for what you're cooking.If you want browning around the sides and bottoms of your foods, go for metal bakeware.
If you want to decrease browning, go for glass or silicone products.

Coat your oven in baking soda and water.,
Add vinegar and scrub off the baking soda.,
Place the oven racks back in the oven.",How to Use an Oven3," If your oven has a self cleaning option, that's usually the best way to get the job done. Your oven's instruction manual should indicate how to use the self cleaning option. Usually, the oven will lock and self clean for about two hours. After the oven finishes self cleaning, you simply wipe off any debris with a paper towel., If your oven does not have a self cleaning option, you will need to clean it manually. To start, remove the oven racks and clean them.Lay a towel down on the bottom of your bathtub and fill the tub with hot water. Add half a cup of powder dishwasher detergent and swish it around into the water.
Let the racks soak for about four hours. Then, wipe off any gunk and stains with a non-abrasive scrub brush.
Rinse the racks completely and then allow them to air dry.

, Mix baking soda and water until you form a workable paste. Then, use a cloth or sponge to coat the inside of your oven with your paste. Make sure to get the sides, bottom, and top of your oven., Pour vinegar over the baking soda and water mixture. Allow the vinegar to sit on until it begins to fizzle lightly. This should happen fairly quickly. This helps loosen dirt and debris, allowing you to easily clean your oven.Once the vinegar is fizzling, use a sponge to scrub down the top, bottom, and sides of an oven. Scrub until you remove all loose dirt and debris.
When you're done, use a paper towel to remove any lingering baking soda, water, and loose dirt and bits of food.

, After you've cleaned out the interior of the oven, place your oven racks back in place. Your oven should now be clean and ready to use."

",How to Use an Overripe Tomato,"


In order to freeze overripe tomatoes, first cut away any bad or leaking spots, then wash the tomato. Dry the tomato and then put it in a freezer-safe plastic bag. You can add the tomatoes to the bag as they become overripe.
Once you've accumulated 8 to 10 tomatoes, you can use them to make your favorite tomato sauce. Alternatively, single tomatoes can be added to enrich a store-bought sauce. Allow the tomato to thaw, remove the loose skin, dice it and add it to your sauce.;
,


Tomato soup is, for many, the quintessential comfort food soup. It is enjoyed all year round, and overripe tomatoes are suitable. Substitute overripe tomatoes in your favorite recipe if it calls for canned tomatoes. 4 to 6 medium sized overripe tomatoes provides about the same quantity as a 28 fl. oz. (828 ml) can of diced tomatoes.

,


Oven dried tomatoes made from overripe tomatoes are especially rich in flavor. They may take additional time to dry in the oven, but the process is the same. Slice the washed and trimmed tomatoes into 1/4 inch (0.5 cm) thick slices. Arrange them on a cookie sheet that has been lined with parchment paper. Dry them in a 250 degree F (120 degree C) oven for about 2 to 6 hours, or until the edges have shriveled and there are no runny juices.
Oven dried tomatoes can be used sliced in salads, pasta dishes, baked into breads, or any other variety of applications.

,


Overripe tomatoes are a good kind to use when making your own tomato or vegetable juice. Wash and trim the tomatoes of any blemishes, then add them to your juicer as per manufacturer's instructions.

,


Tomato pulp has just enough acidity in it to revive your skin, increase circulation and give you a healthy glow. Cut an overripe tomato in half and using a spoon, discard the seeds. Mash the tomato pulp with an equal amount of plain yogurt and spread it on your face. Wash it off in 10 to 15 minutes and admire your new glow.

Split the pod if you want to use the seeds.,
Scrape out the seeds.,
Add the seeds to a baking recipe.,
Create a vanilla infused sugar.,
Make your own vanilla extract for baking.",How to Use a Vanilla Bean1," If you are planning to use the vanilla bean in a batter for a cake or for a batch of cookies, you will need to open the vanilla bean pod and remove the seeds. You will then add the seeds to the batter to infuse it with a natural vanilla flavor.To split the pod, lay the vanilla bean pod on top of a clean, dry cutting board. Turn the hooked end of the vanilla bean to the top of the board. Hold the top of the vanilla bean with your non-dominant hand and a sharp paring knife with your dominant hand.
Split the pod with a long, vertical stroke through the middle of the bean. Cut only into the center of the pod, not through it completely. You want access to the tiny, dense seeds in the middle. Go slowly. If the knife slips in your hand against the bean, realign your knife with your previous cut and continue cutting the bean.;
, Peel the two sides of the vanilla bean outward with the side of the blade. Don’t use the sharp end, since you don’t want to cut the vanilla bean further.Use the side of the knife or a small spoon to dig out the seeds. Dig the seeds out of the pod by running the spoon or the knife down the inside of one side of the pod.
You should open the vanilla bean right before you plan to use them in cooking or baking. Keep in mind one vanilla bean is equal to three teaspoons vanilla extract. If you only need half that amount, you would only cut halfway down the bean, exposing only half of the seeds.
A table of conversions for vanilla bean can be found online., If you have a recipe for a cake, cookies, or a pie that require vanilla extract, you can use the vanilla seeds instead. Add the vanilla when you cream the butter in the recipe as this will ensure the seeds are well incorporated into the batter.


You can also ensure the seeds are evenly distributed in your batter by taking a small amount of the batter and using a spoon or your hands to smush the seeds into the batter. Then, fold the batter with the seeds into the rest of the batter.A list of cakes, cookies, and pies that use vanilla bean can be found online., You can also rub the vanilla seeds into white sugar, infusing the sugar with vanilla. Rubbing the vanilla into the sugar will release the aroma of the vanilla and infuse the sugar with a natural vanilla taste. The sugar can then be used when sugar is required in a recipe.Use the vanilla infused sugar in cookies like vanilla bean sables or vanilla shortbread.

, Rather than spend a lot of money on vanilla extract at the store, make your own by saving the split vanilla pods and using them to make vanilla extract at home. This is a time based process, so if you know you are going to need vanilla extract for baking you make the extract at least one to two months ahead of time.Place three to four split vanilla pods lengthwise in a clean, glass container. Add a pint of high quality vodka, rum, or bourbon to the container and seal the container. Let the container sit in a cool, dark place for one month if you are using rum and three to four months if you are using vodka. Shake the jar periodically to move around the flavors in the container. The richness of the extract will depend on how long you let the pods soak in the alcohol.
Use Grade B vanilla beans to make vanilla extract. You can use Grade A beans as well but they will be more expensive."

Combine flour and water for a simple sauce thickener.,
Stir the flour mixture into your warm sauce.,
Continue cooking the sauce over medium-high heat.,
Reduce heat and continue cooking.",How to Thicken Liquids1," This technique works well when you need to correct an overly thin sauce near the end of cookingMix the flour and water together in a small bowl that is separate from the sauce you are cooking.


Mix 2 tablespoons (16 g) of all-purpose flour with a ¼ cup (60 ml) cold water.
A whisk works well to quickly create a flour paste that is free from lumps. You can also use a fork or a spoon to stir your water and flour together.
Stir until the mixture is completely smooth.;
, Add your mixture gradually, a tablespoon at a time, and stir between each addition.


When you add the flour and water, your sauce should be warm but not close to boiling.

, Bring the sauce to a boil. To thicken properly with flour, you must bring your liquid to a boil.


Stir the sauce occasionally. This ensures that your sauce doesn’t stick to the pan.

, After you reduce the temperature, cook the sauce for about a minute on low heat. While it’s simmering on low, the sauce should thicken considerably. This also ensures that your sauce won't have the starchy taste of flour."

, Baking is to cook food using dry heat, usually inside a gas or electric oven. Solar and camp ovens can also bake food. Foods commonly baked include casseroles, cakes, and cookies.

, Blending is to thoroughly mix ingredients, which may involve liquefying them in an electric blender.

, To boil means to cook something in liquid where you can see bubbles breaking the surface. For example, pasta is normally cooked in boiling water.

, Broiling is to cook something under direct heat. Common foods broiled include steak, fish steaks, chicken breasts, or open-faced cheese sandwiches.

, Braised food is first browned in a small amount of fat and then simmered over low heat in a small amount of liquid. The liquid should partially cover the food but not totally cover it. Cooking a pot roast or pork chops are two examples of braising.

, Browning is to heat a small amount of fat in a skillet or pan, and add the food, cooking on both sides until brown in color. Browning adds color and flavor to the dish. Common foods that are browned during cooking include fried chicken, steaks, pot roast and fried potatoes. Fry or sauté are other terms used for browning.

, Cooking is the catch-all word for preparing food, but in a more defined sense, cooking means to apply heat to food.

, Chopping is to cut food into pieces. The food can be cut into fine or coarse pieces.

, This term is normally used in baking. It means to combine butter, sugar, egg and flavoring until light and fluffy.

, When food is cubed, it is cut into even pieces resembling small squares. Cheese and vegetables are both commonly cubed.

, Food is submerged into hot fat in the process of deep frying. Doughnuts and fried chicken are commonly cooked this way.

, Evaporated milk is sold in cans and can be purchased in full fat or low-fat versions. The milk is unsweetened. May be used diluted in any recipe calling for milk, used in candy making, and poured into coffee or tea as a creamer., A fillet is a thin boneless piece of meat, poultry or fish.

, Folding means to gently incorporate ingredients. Combining flour into a beaten egg whites or adding sugar to egg whites are two examples of having ingredients folded into them.

, Frying is to cook food in a small amount of hot oil.

, If a food is grated, the food is chopped coarsely using a food grater. Food can be grated by using a food grater or a grating disk on a food processor. Cheese and nuts are commonly grated.

, To cut food into even-sized matchsticks is to julienne. Vegetables are typically cut in this fashion.

, When you marinate a food, the food is placed in a seasoned liquid for a set amount of time. The food is usually allowed to marinate in the refrigerator. Common foods placed in marinade include chicken breasts, beef, pork or turkey.

, When you mix, you combine ingredients using a spoon or mixer.

, Powdered sugar is also known as icing sugar, and is 10X sugar and confectioner's sugar. It is a powdery white sugar, with a small crystal and mixed with a bit of cornstarch, which is mainly used to make frosting or icing.

, Proofing means to allow yeast bread to rise. It also means to test to see if yeast is still viable. To proof yeast, add a teaspoon yeast to a bit of water and sugar. Let stand ten minutes and if the mixture bubbles and smells yeasty, it is good to use for baking.

, When a meat is roasted, large, tender cuts of meat are placed in an oven and baked, uncovered, until cooking is finished.

, When simmering, liquid has small bubbles that gently come to the surface. They do not ""break"" as in boiling but gently rise to the top.

, When food is stewed, it's cooked gently in liquid. Beef or chicken stew and stewed fruits are examples of foods commonly cooked using this method.

, Sweetened condensed milk is milk that has sugar added and is condensed. Used in candy making, baked goods and desserts. Some people like to eat it poured over cereal or straight from the can., Whipping a food is to incorporate air into that ingredient. Common foods that are whipped include cream and egg whites., Zest is the outer part of citrus fruit, removed with a scraper or grater.

, We'll cover the things you can put inside in the next section, but for now just know that it all goes in there, pretty much however you want. It's a good idea to get a little liquid near the bottom to get everything going -- otherwise the solid stuff doesn't move around very easily.









If you're blending ice, you'll need a little bit of liquid to get it going. The ice floats in water, letting the blades do their thing. No water and the ice will just wedge itself against the sides, slowly melting.

, That little cap that comes off? That's the feeder cap. You can leave your blender going, remove the feeder cap, and add in a few more (albeit small) things if you'd like. But other than that, it's best to leave the lid on -- or else you might end up with blender goo on your walls.









If it doesn't start, make sure the bottom of the blender is placed securely in the base. If the base and the blender aren't meeting just so, it can't make the connection to start whizzing and whirring.

, Try experimenting with the buttons. Choose an appropriate speed setting depending on what you are blending. Generally speaking, the further you go to the right, the higher the speed.









Chop, grate, grind, blend, mix, stir, puree, whip, and liquefy -- don't worry too much about these. You can't really use any ""incorrectly."" If it isn't the consistency you want it to be, try a higher speed. If that doesn't work, stop the blender, take off the lid, mix it up, and start again.

, If you're done that is. You may need to scrape out the bottom or undo the blades to get it all out of there, especially if it's thick. That's it!

, Take off the blades from the jar and wash the two parts separately. Just run them under warm water with a little soap; alternatively, you can put them in your dishwasher. It's safe.


Never, ever, ever put the base in water! If you get it gunky, take a wet cloth or sponge to it. It's hard to hurt it -- and water (or any other liquid) is really the only way.

Apart from fire and all.

Add a vanilla pod to a quart of milk.,
Place a vanilla bean in your sugar bowl.,
Put dried vanilla in your coffee beans.",How to Use a Vanilla Bean2," If you would like to use a vanilla bean in baking recipes that contain milk, you can add the vanilla pod to a quart of milk and heat up the milk in a saucepan over medium high heat. You can also use the vanilla pod in puddings, custards, and other milk based recipes.Another option is to throw the vanilla bean seeds and the split vanilla bean pods into the pot of milk for an extra kick of vanilla. You may want to try the milk after a few minutes of boiling to ensure the vanilla flavor is present in the milk but not overpowering.

, Give your sugar a vanilla flavor by adding split vanilla beans or whole vanilla beans to your sugar bowl or sugar shaker. The vanilla bean will give off a natural flavor and infuse the sugar so you have vanilla flavored sugar. You can then use the sugar in your morning coffee or in baked goods., If you’d like to infuse your coffee with a natural vanilla flavor, you can place dried vanilla in your bag of coffee beans. You can use vanilla seeds or vanilla pods, laying them in your coffee beans overnight or for several weeks. Over time, the coffee beans will become infused with the vanilla.

Wrap the bean in foil and store it in a cool, dark place.,
Plump up dried out beans with boiling water.,
Use fresh vanilla beans within two to three weeks.",How to Use a Vanilla Bean3," Vanilla beans are susceptible to air and can dry out if they are left unwrapped. To prevent the vanilla bean from becoming brittle, you should wrap the bean in tin foil and seal it in a zip-lock bag. You can then store it in a cool, dark spot in your kitchen.Do not store vanilla bean in your refrigerator or your freezer, as these spots are too cold for the bean and can in fact dry it out. Instead, look for a spot in a low cupboard to store the bean.
Vanilla beans that are stored properly will last for several weeks., If your vanilla bean starts to dry out or appear brittle, you can revive it by immersing it in a pot of boiling water for several minutes. This should help to plump up the beans and bring it back to it’s original shape and texture., If you are planning to use fresh vanilla bean seeds for baking or cooking, you should aim to use up the vanilla beans within two to three weeks. After this time, the beans will start to dry out, even if they are stored properly in a cool, dark place."

Make a beurre manié.Two types of thickeners using fat and flour are a beurre manié or a roux.Thickening with flour and fat give sauces and gravies a smoother texture than thickening with flour and water, and a beurre manié has a smooth, rich taste.,
Add your beurre manié to a sauce.,
Create a roux.A roux is an excellent way to make thick stews, gravy, gumbo, or cheese sauce.,
Use an alternative to butter.",How to Thicken Liquids2,"

Mix together 4 tablespoons (32 g) each of all-purpose flour and room temperature, softened butter in a small bowl.
Use a fork to mash together the flour and butter until they form a paste.
Form this paste into small, tablespoon sized balls for easy use. If you don’t need to use them right away, freeze these balls in an air tight container, and bring them to room temperature before use.

, The sauce should be almost finished cooking, as you don’t want the beurre manié to cook for too long.

Whisk it into your sauce thoroughly, and allow the sauce to simmer for an additional minute or two before taking it off of the heat. This will ensure the taste of your sauce is smooth, without any residual starchy flavor from the flour.

, Use two tablespoons (16 g) of butter and all-purpose flour. Roux also uses an equal ratio of flour to butter.


Heat the butter over medium heat in a saucepan, until it’s melted.
Once the butter has melted, gradually add in the flour, whisking constantly until it’s combined and smooth.
At this stage, decide how dark you want your roux to be. A darker roux has a darker brown coloring and a nuttier flavor. For a dark roux, continue cooking just until you start to smell a nutty aroma, and your roux is a caramel color. Take your roux off the heat.
Gradually whisk your roux into your sauce.
Cook the sauce over medium to medium-low heat for 30 minutes or more, stirring occasionally with a spoon, to give it a smooth, velvety texture. Some bubbling is fine, but do not keep the sauce at a boil.

, Though butter often works best, you can use a combination of other fats and flour to create a similar thickening effect.

For gravies or stews, consider using meat drippings instead of butter.
If you want a vegan option, you can use a plant-based oil, like olive oil, or a premade vegan butter in place of butter."
"
Use cornstarch in sauce.,
Use arrowroot starch to thicken liquids.,
Thicken with tapioca.",How to Thicken Liquids3," Starches offer a low-fat, simple thickening alternative for sauces that is especially suitable for beginning cooks.Starch thickeners are mostly flavorless, but they can give sauces an artificial sheen, making them less popular for stews or meat gravies.


Cornstarch is inexpensive, readily available, and best for dairy-based sauces. Do not use cornstarch if you plan on freezing a sauce for later use, however, as cornstarch creates a spongy texture in sauce upon freezing.
Combine 1 tablespoon (8 g) of cornstarch with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of cold water in a small bowl. With a whisk, blend them together until smooth.
Gradually whisk the mixture into your cooked sauce that needs thickening.
Continue stirring and cooking the sauce over medium to medium-high heat. Bring it to a boil.
Reduce the heat to low, and stir the sauce for an additional two minutes, allowing the cornstarch to completely finish cooking and thickening.
If you don’t cook your starches, they can leave an aftertaste in your sauce.

, Arrowroot is best for more acidic sauces, but avoid mixing arrowroot with dairy.However, you can use arrowroot when cooking with acidic dairy products like buttermilk. Arrowroot starch gives liquids a glossy appearance, making it especially desirable for dessert sauces or reductions.


In a small bowl, mix equal parts of the arrowroot starch with cold water, whisking thoroughly to beat out any lumps.
Add the arrowroot mixture to the already hot liquid and cook for 30 seconds at medium-high heat, stirring constantly.
Remove the sauce from the heat, and allow it to finish thickening as it stands.

, This is a good option for sauces that need to thicken just before they finished cooking.Like arrowroot starch, tapioca doesn’t need to come to a boil to thicken a sauce.

Whisk together equal parts flour and water in a small bowl.
Gradually add this mixture to your sauce, and cook for about a minute on medium-high heat.
Remove from heat, and let the sauce stand to thicken.

Use a whisk or fork to rapidly beat your egg yolks.,
Temper the yolks.,
Use a thermometer.,
Stir the tempered egg yolk mixture into the sauce.",How to Thicken Liquids4," Thickening with egg yolks provides a nuanced rich flavor. Sauces like hollandaise are classically thickened this way. Egg yolk can be more difficult to work with than some other thickening agents because overheating will cause the egg yolk to curdle.Beat the yolks until they appear consistently smooth and slightly frothy.


Use 2 to 3 egg yolks per cup of liquid sauce you want to thicken.
The more egg yolks you use, the thicker the resulting sauce will be.

, First, bring the beaten egg yolks to room temperature to prepare them for tempering. Don’t try to speed up this process by using heat. Take some of your hot sauce that you want to thicken, and add it gradually to the beaten egg yolks. This will slowly raise the temperature of the yolks and prevent them from curdling.

, To thicken with egg yolks, it is best to use a thermometer while you are tempering the yolks. You want to add enough sauce to the yolks to bring them to the same temperature as your sauce. For the best thickening, this temperature should stay between 149 (65 degrees Celsius) and 158 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius).

, Stir until the two are blended. After you add your egg yolks, avoid letting the sauce get above 190 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius). If the temperature of your sauce is too high, your egg yolks could curdle."
"
Bring your sauce to a rapid boil.,
Reduce heat.,
Take the sauce off the heat.",How to Thicken Liquids5," Thickening by reduction intensifies your sauce and also thickens it. This method works well for soups, sauces, and alcohols. It is the best way to thicken naturally without any additives.When you make a reduction, the sauce thickens as water evaporates into steam.


Keep your pot uncovered so the steam can escape.
Stir occasionally to make sure that your sauce doesn’t boil over the pan.

, After large bubbles form in your sauce, you want to reduce the heat and continue to let it simmer until it reaches the desired thickness.


Stir occasionally and taste to see if you want to continue cooking your sauce.
A thicker sauce can take a long time to achieve but will have intense flavor.

, Once your sauce has achieved the thickness you desire, turn off the heat and serve.

Once it stops cooking, a reduction will not thicken as much as sauces that were cooked with starches or flour.

Use guar gum to thicken a cold sauce.Guar gum is a powder made from a seed native to the Asian tropics.,
Thicken with xanthan gum.,
Use gelatin to thicken sauces.",How to Thicken Liquids6," It's a great alternative to starches or flour, when you need to thicken a sauce that is already cold.

Use 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 g) of guar gum per quart (1 L) of sauce or liquid that you want to thicken.
If possible, combine the guar gum with oil before adding it to your sauce. This helps it to stay smooth and not create a gummy textures in the sauce. You can mix a few spoonfuls of oil with your guar gum by hand or in a food processor.
For example, if you're thickening a salad dressing, mix the guar gum with a bit of olive oil, and then stir it into your dressing.
Let the sauce sit to thicken.

, As a rule, guar gum works best for thickening cold sauces. However, if you are thickening a highly acidic cold sauce use xanthan gum instead. Guar gum doesn't thicken as well with acids like citrus.

As with guar gum, use 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 g) of xanthan gum per quart (1 L) of sauce that you want to thicken.
It works best to first mix the xanthan gum with a small amount of oil, but if you don't want to do this, you can whisk the xanthan gum directly into your sauce, and let it sit to thicken.

, Gelatin can be used to thicken cold sauces, but you must first dissolve it in warm water, and then let it cool. Gelatin can also be an alternative to carbohydrate thickeners like flour.

To create a thick sauce with gelatin, use 4.5 teaspoons (22.5 g) of unflavored gelatin for every 1 cup (236 ml) of sauce that you have.
In a bowl, add hot water to your powdered gelatin. Slowly pour in just enough water to dissolve all the gelatin granules.
Then, add your hot water and gelatin mixture to your cold sauce. Allow the sauce to come back to room temperature, and then refrigerate.

Nectar-thick liquids are easy to pour. They're approximately the thickness of a cream soup.
Combine 1 and 1/2 teaspoons (7.5 g) of commercial thickener to 1/2 cup (118 ml) of thin liquid.
You can purchase commercial thickeners at most drug stores.

, Honey-thick liquids are not as pourable as nectar. They drizzle off of your spoon slowly.

Combine 1 and 1/2 tablespoons (22.5 g) of your commercial thickener with 1/2 cup (118 ml) of thin liquid.

, This is the thickest consistency that you should thicken your liquids for medical reasons. You can eat pudding-thick liquids with a spoon.

To create pudding thickened liquids, combine 2 tablespoons (30 g) of commercial thickener with 1/2 cup (118 ml) of thin liquid.

Use 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour to replace 1 cup of white flour.,
Add two additional tablespoons of liquid when baking with wholewheat flour.,
Try replacing only 1/3 to 1/2 of the white flour with whole wheat flour at first, then gradually increase the amount.,
Reduce the quantity of butter or shortening by about 20%.",How to Substitute Whole Wheat Flour for White Flour1," Whole wheat flour is denser and heavier than regular white flour, therefore in order to produce baked goods with the same texture as white flour you need to use less flour. A good rule of thumb is to substitute 3/4 of a cup of whole wheat flour for 1 cup of white flour.Be careful when measuring out the flour too, simply scooping the flour out of the bag with a cup can cause the flour to become too compact and you will end up using more flour that you actually need. Instead, try using a spoon to add the flour to the measuring cup.;
, Whole wheat flour absorbs liquid more slowly than white flour. Therefore, you will need to add additional liquid to the mixture to prevent the finished product from being too dry.


A good rule of thumb is to add two additional tablespoons of liquid (water/milk/etc.) on top of what the recipe already calls for.
As whole wheat flour absorbs liquid more slowly, whole wheat doughs will be stickier than white flour doughs. This is normal.

, If you are new to using whole wheat flour, it's a good idea to start out by replacing just 1/3 or 1/4 cup of the white flour with whole wheat. This will give your taste buds time to adjust to the new flavor and texture.As you become accustomed to the whole wheat flavor, you can try substituting more and more of the white flour with the whole wheat, until eventually you have completely switched from white to whole wheat.

, Another way to make your baked goods less dense when using whole wheat flour is to reduce the butter or shortening content by approximately 20%.

Emphasize essential safety rules early and often.,
Develop the safety rules further over time.,
Provide a kid-friendly workspace.,
Let each child learn at their own pace.",How to Teach Kids Basic Cooking Techniques1," Use simple, direct statements to hammer home the dangers found in the kitchen. And, right from the start, make it clear what they can help with and what tasks and tools are strictly off-limits:""Fire burns. It can cook the chicken, but it can also hurt your hand very badly.”
""Steam means the water is very hot. It cooks our noodles, but it can also burn your skin.”
""Knives are sharp. They cut our vegetables, but can also cut your finger and make it bleed.”
""You can help put the cookies on the cooled trays, but only I can put them in the oven or take them out.”;
, Before permitting a child with basic kitchen experience to take on more responsibilities, make sure to reiterate the essential safety rules and expand them to cover more specific tasks, tools, and techniques. Lay out rules such as keeping pot handles facing toward the back of the stovetop; using oven mitts anytime hot cookware is handled; and tying back loose hair or clothing near open flames., While most kids will be happy to stand on a chair and work at the kitchen counter with you, it’s safer to bring the work down closer to their level. If possible, try to work at a lower, kid-friendly table (you can sit down if that’s easier for you). Look for kid-sized kitchen tools as well.A kid-friendly workspace and tools can also help a child feel more engaged and eager to learn.

, Cooking skills, just like any other skills, will develop at different paces for different kids. One eight-year-old might be chopping cucumbers, while another is better left to mixing up the salad dressing.While a child’s eagerness shouldn’t override your judgement regarding their skill level and cooking experience, a kid who is itching to try out a new cooking technique is more likely ready to give it a go.
Use the inverse as a guide as well: if a child is hesitant to try using a chopping knife or the stovetop, it may be best to hold back for the time being.

Add a couple of tablespoons of orange juice to combat the bitter flavor of whole wheat flour.,
Add wheat gluten to help whole wheat breads rise.,
Try using white whole wheat flour for a lighter texture and flavor.",How to Substitute Whole Wheat Flour for White Flour2," Whole wheat flour has a much stronger flavor than regular flour, and can sometimes impart a bitter flavor to baked goods. To combat this, try replacing two tablespoons of the liquid used in the recipe (water/milk) with orange juice.


The orange juice is sweet and full of natural sugars, so it will compensate for the bitter flavor of the wholewheat.

, Adding wheat gluten to whole wheat flour when making bread helps the bread rise better.The gluten can further be assisted by a process called ‘sponge’.


According to this method, half of the flour should be mixed with yeast which has been proofed. This mixture can be left to sit for a couple of hours before baking.
This process helps to strengthen the gluten by retaining the carbon dioxide released by the yeast. This helps the bread rise higher and better.
For each teaspoon of wheat gluten you use, add an addition 1 1/4 teaspoon of water., For softer baked goods like cakes and muffins, regular whole wheat can produce a harder, chewier result, which isn't necessary the effect you want to achieve. To overcome this, white whole wheat flour instead.


White whole wheat flour is made from a softer, lighter-colored type of wheat, whose taste isn't as strong as regular whole wheat.
White whole wheat flour has the same nutritional content as regular whole wheat, the difference in texture and flavor comes from the environmental conditions under which the wheat is grown.

"
"
Sift the whole wheat flour a couple of times to introduce more air.,
Bake foods containing whole wheat flour for slightly longer.",How to Substitute Whole Wheat Flour for White Flour3," As mentioned above, whole wheat flour is heavier than white flour, which can leave your baked goods dense and stodgy. To avoid this, try sifting your whole wheat flour two or three times before using it.

, Whole wheat batters and doughs tend to be thicker than those made with white flour. As a result, it's a good idea to allow for a slightly longer cooking time to ensure the baked goods are fully cooked through.


The one problem with this is that a longer cooking time may cause the outside of the baked goods to burn, while the inside remains undercooked.
To combat this, you should also reduce the temperature of the oven (or pan, if you're making wholewheat pancakes) and increase the cooking time even further.

Read the recipe closely.Directions for simmering vary from recipe to recipe.,
Set the heat to medium-low for a gradual simmer.Place the dish you're cooking on the burner and start off at a medium to low heat.,
Observe the amount of bubbles rising to the surface.,
Test for a temperature between 185°F (85°C) and 205°F (96°C) .If you have a cooking thermometer, you can always test the liquid to find out if you’ve achieved a simmer.,
Regulate the heat to maintain a constant simmer.Once you've reached the simmering point, you will need to adjust the heat between medium-low and low to maintain a constant simmer.",How to Simmer1," In most cases, a recipe will suggest one of two ways to do it. It may ask you to bring the liquid of a dish to a simmer, which means to slowly bring the liquid to just below boiling point over low heat. The other common direction is to bring the liquid of a dish to the boiling point first, and then reduce it to a simmer. The two techniques yield different results, so it’s important to practice them properly.


To simmer means to bring a liquid to a temperature that is just below the boiling point – somewhere between 185°F (85°C) and 205°F (96°C).The boiling point of liquid in cooking is approximately 212°F (100°C).;
, Stay near the stovetop, since you will probably need to adjust the heat up or down as the liquid is brought up to a simmer. It’s a good rule of thumb to never turn your back on a simmer in progress until you’re sure you’ve reached a point of constant simmering.









Experiment with a pot of water if you want to practice first.
Try out different heat settings to get a feel for how the cooking liquid appears at different temperatures.

, You know something is simmering when there are pockets of tiny, continuous bubbles breaking the surface with irregular wisps of steam. Simmering is most commonly used to allow the flavors of a dish to infuse and to slow-cook meats until they are tender.









A “slow simmer” is when a couple of tiny bubbles erupt every 1 or 2 seconds. A slow simmer is most often used to slow-cook stocks.
A “rapid simmer” happens when larger pockets of small, continuous bubbles erupt at the surface, displaying wisps of steam, with larger bubbles beginning to show.
A rapid simmer is sometimes referred to as a gentle boil; it's mostly used to thicken liquid into sauce., Most people don’t use a thermometer – they gauge by observation. You'll get more experienced at this as you go along.









Temperatures between 185°F (85°C) and 205°F (96°C) are considered simmering.
The range is relatively high because there are different levels of simmering, starting with a slow simmer and going up to a rapid simmer., Slightly adjust the heat up or down as needed. Once you’ve achieved a steady simmer, you will still need to stir the liquid occasionally.









Whenever you introduce new ingredients to simmering liquid, the heat will definitely need to be adjusted.
Some liquids and sauces require more frequent stirring than others. Check your recipe for details.
Stay at your stove to supervise during this initial stage until you get a feel for how often it needs to be stirred.

Organize your food supply.,
Organize your recipes.,
Eliminate duplicate utensils and kitchen appliances.,
Buy an extra cutting board.,
Read recipes from beginning to end before cooking.,
Substitute ingredients where needed depending on your food supply.,
Clean the kitchen as you cook.",How to Simplify Your Cooking," Your cooking can be simplified if you only keep food and ingredients that you plan on eating and using.


Donate non-perishable items and canned goods you do not plan on eating to a food pantry, food bank, or donation center.
Throw away foods that have expired or that have already been opened, but you do not plan on eating.;
, If your cookbooks and recipes are all stored in one location, it can help simplify your cooking process, especially during holidays.


Place all recipes that have been clipped from magazines and other sources into plastic coated pages, then place these pages into a ringed binder. This will prevent your recipes from becoming wet or ruined as you refer to the recipes during cooking.
Place all your cookbooks on a shelf in your kitchen or on the same shelf in a nearby bookcase.

, This will help reduce any unnecessary clutter and duplicate gadgets that can be taking up room in your kitchen.


Sort through your collection of cooking spoons, ladles, strainers, casserole pans, and all other utensils and cookware to rid of duplicate items you do not use.
Keep appliances that perform multiple functions and rid yourself of similar appliances that perform single functions. For example, if you have a toaster and a toaster oven, dispose of or donate your toaster, since you can perform the same tasks with your toaster oven.

, This will prevent you from cross-contaminating certain foods and save you time from having to wash and disinfect the same cutting board before cutting a different food type.


Use one cutting board for raw meats such as beef, poultry and seafood, and use the other cutting board for ready-to-eat foods such as vegetables, fruits, and cheese.

, This practice will allow you to verify beforehand that you understand how to cook the recipe, that you have the proper amount of preparation and cooking time, and that you have the ingredients and utensils needed.


Measure and pour each ingredient into small cups or bowls, then lay them out on the counter before cooking to verify that you have the proper amounts.

, Although recipes may list certain ingredients, in most cases you can substitute similar ingredients to simplify your cooking experience. For example, if a stew calls for peas and green beans but you only have carrots and potatoes, use these ingredients instead.

, This practice will simplify your cleaning process after you finish cooking. For example, while waiting for food to simmer, put ingredients away or wash measuring spoons.

Let preschoolers use basic kitchen tools.,
Introduce the use of sharper cutting implements carefully.,
Give kids ages six to eight more food prep responsibilities.,
Permit experienced nine- to eleven-year-olds to use power and heat.,
Give kids age twelve or older more freedom.",How to Teach Kids Basic Cooking Techniques2," Kids around age three can attempt simple tasks like rinsing off fruits and vegetables, stirring or spooning a batter, mashing bananas with a dull fork, or sprinkling decorations on baked goods. Supervise them at all times, give them pointers, and be ready to clean up the mess.By roughly age three to five, you can permit a child to cut soft items (butter, bananas, etc.) with a dull, nonmetal, kid-friendly kitchen knife. Still supervise them closely, though.

, If they have previous kitchen experience, seven-year-olds (give or take a year) may be ready to handle a sharper knife and kitchen shears. Use your best judgment regarding their experience and skills, of course, and always supervise them at all times when they use sharper tools like these.Before you allow them to do any kind of slicing or chopping with a kitchen knife, instruct them in the ""claw technique,” which keeps the fingertips and thumb of the off-hand safe from the knife blade at all times.

, In addition to possibly using a kitchen knife, kids in this age range can often handle tasks like peeling, grating, whisking, folding, and measuring. They can also help — enthusiastically or not — with setting the table and cleaning up messes.Don’t feel like you need to push your eight-year-old to use a grater or knife, though — let them develop kitchen skills at their own pace, and keep it fun.

, By around ten years of age, a child who is comfortable in the kitchen may be ready to use small appliances like hand mixers, blenders, food processors, and microwaves. Also, they may be capable of baking or cooking over heat on the stovetop — with constant supervision.You could help a child of this age make sauteed mushrooms, for instance, since this recipe involves skills like chopping and cooking over heat — but is also quick and easy., By around age twelve, a child who has ample kitchen experience may be ready to have a generally free hand in preparing and cooking typical recipes. Many kids won’t be to this point by this age, and that’s fine. But, you also shouldn’t feel the need to hold back a child around this age who is ready to tackle general cooking techniques.Continue to supervise kids though, likely at least into the mid-teen years. Think of it as an opportunity for more bonding time.

Bake with a child.,
Sauté on the stovetop together.,
Roast meats or vegetables in the oven.,
Boil or poach foods with your kid.,
Give frying a try.",How to Teach Kids Basic Cooking Techniques3," Baking is a great cooking technique to start with, because you can isolate the components that involve heat — that is, kids can help prepare the food before baking and decorate or garnish it afterward. It also demonstrates how things like stirring, folding, kneading, and applying heat can radically change the physical (and flavor) properties of combined food ingredients.


From the start, prioritize safety in regards to food (e.g., don’t eat egg-based raw batters) and heat (e.g., use oven mitts with baking sheets).
Consider oven-fried chicken bites as a recipe idea, as it will show kids that there are healthier alternatives to those fast food mystery nuggets., Sautéing is a great introduction to the stovetop, because it’s a relatively fast and simple cooking method. You just need a good pan, a good burner, a bit of oil or other fat, and something tasty to cook up. Veggies are a great option to sauté, which means you can also practice chopping food into pieces of similar size.


Fajitas might make a good recipe to try together, as it involves chopping and sautéing various veggies and chicken., Whether you want to have pork or beef for dinner, or prefer to make the veggies the star of the meal, roasting is a great technique to share with kids who can safely do some chopping and be around the oven. Depending on their experience and skill levels, you can have them focus on the prep work or help out with using the oven itself.


Before trying roasting recipes with your kid, make sure they know to treat any pan as a hot pan — that is, to use oven mitts by default.

, Yes, cooking in hot liquids will open the gateway to making that childhood staple — boxed macaroni and cheese. But boiling and poaching also unlock crowd pleasing dishes starring various other pastas, eggs, chicken, fish, and more.


Wait until your child has a bit more comfort and experience in the kitchen, since these types of cooking involve not only scalding liquids but also hot steam, hot pots, and open flames.
Try simple soup and stew recipes, especially ones that show how you can use yesterday’s leftovers in today’s meal.

, Most kids are well aware of — and enjoy — fried foods, but teaching them to fry at home can at least slightly improve the healthiness of this cooking technique. However, keep in mind that hot oil is far more dangerous than hot water, especially if it splatters onto skin or ignites.


Wait until a child is fully comfortable in the kitchen (and you are fully confident in their abilities) before attempting frying. Supervise them at all times and take proper safety precautions to prevent burns and fires.
French fries, of course, is a simple frying recipe that is sure to be a hit with kids."

Follow the recipe instructions to start the sauce.,
Reduce the heat to low.,
Regulate the heat and stir occasionally.,
Simmer the sauce until the desired consistency is acquired.",How to Simmer2," Many recipes will ask you to make the sauce’s foundation and then simmer it for a certain amount of time. This will “reduce” the sauce. Essentially, this means to thicken the sauce’s consistency. When you reduce a sauce, the ingredients develop through a period of simmering into a thicker, richer, more flavorful substance.The longer you simmer the sauce, the thicker it will become and the more it will “reduce.”The most commonly reduced sauces are tomato sauce, Béchamel sauce, balsamic reduction sauce, red wine reduction sauce and most sauces that begin with meat drippings.White sauces typically aren't reduced.

, Once you’ve created the foundation of your sauce, reduce the heat to low to bring it down to a simmer. You’ve reached a “simmer” when you see tiny, continuous bubbles breaking the surface of the sauce. You’ll also see irregular wisps of steam rise up from the sauce. As you’re bringing your sauce down to a simmer, stir it frequently.








It’s best to stay with the sauce at least until a steady simmer is achieved.
Avoid turning your back to do something else at this stage. Keep an eye on the sauce.

, You may need to adjust the heat between medium-low and low to maintain simmering for an extended period of time. Once you’ve achieved a steady simmer, you can leave the sauce alone for longer periods of time without too much worry. You do need to return to the sauce to stir it occasionally. Regulating the heat properly and frequent stirring helps to prevent a sauce form getting burned. Keep a close eye on this.









If it does burn and you don't notice, you'll end up stirring charred bits from the bottom of the pan into your sauce.
Avoid scraping anything against the bottom of the pan if you've burned the sauce.
Some sauces need more frequent stirring than others, so stay with your sauce for a while until you get a feel for how much stirring is required.
Regulate the heat as needed to maintain the simmer., Some recipes will give you specific directions how long something needs to simmer. Others will tell you to simmer until you’ve reached the thickness you want. Many sauces can be simmered for hours, gradually growing thicker and more flavorful over time. Italian tomato sauce is a great example of a sauce that can be simmered over a period of hours to “reduce” it.









The longer the sauce is simmered, the thicker and more “reduced” it becomes. The flavors become infused and rich.
As long as you stir your sauce occasionally and maintain a steady simmer by regulating the temperature, your reduction will go smoothly."

Spread vegetable oil all over the meat.Instead of coating the skillet with vegetable oil, coat the pieces of meat with it.,
Brown the meat in a skillet over medium high-heat.A cast-iron skillet is the best choice for this.,
Pour the liquid in the skillet and bring it to a boil.,
Reduce the heat to low to bring it to a simmer.,
Put the browned meat back into the skillet.Once you’ve reached the simmer point, carefully add the pieces of meat back into the skillet.",How to Simmer3," You will actually end up using less oil that way, so it’s a more heart-healthy approach. The meat will brown better, as well. In general, the ideal cuts of meat for this are tough and inexpensive. When simmered over time, they become tender.









This approach works best for red meats like beef and lamb.
If you’re working from a recipe, make sure to reference those directions frequently.

, Place the oil-coated pieces of meat into a medium-sized skillet over medium-high heat. Instead of putting all the meat in at once, brown the pieces in small batches.









Use a utensil to move the meat around frequently so that it browns evenly.
Remove each batch after browning.
Put the browned meat on a clean plate and set it to the side.

, After browning all of the meat and removing it from the skillet, pour in your cooking liquid. Depending on that you’re cooking, this will be some kind of stock or possibly wine. The heat should remain at a medium-high level until the liquid has reached a rolling boil.








You know it’s boiling when bubbles are vigorously breaking on the surface and the liquid is moving and churning in the skillet., Once you’ve reached the boiling point, lower the heat to bring the liquid down to a simmer. You’ll know it’s simmering when you see pockets of tiny, continuous bubbles breaking the surface, along with irregular wisps of steam.









The liquid should be at the simmering point before you add the meat back to the skillet.
Adding the meat to a simmering liquid will help it be as tender as possible.

, Regulate the heat as necessary and stir occasionally. You’ll probably need to adjust the heat between medium-low and low to maintain simmering.









These basic guidelines are universal to get the simmer process started for most meats.
The simmer time depends on the type of meat and what you’re making.

Prop the grater against a cutting board.,
Scrape the orange along the grater from top to bottom.,
Rotate the orange slightly after each scrape.,
Keep turning and scraping until the top layer of peel is removed.",How to Zest an Orange2," If you are using a flat grater, hold the grater at an angle, one end resting against the cutting board. If you are using a box grater, simply place the grater on the cutting board.






;
, Maintain enough pressure to remove the top layer of the rind. Take off only the rind of the orange's skin, and not the white pith, which tastes bitter.









Make sure the orange is clean. You might not usually think to wash an orange, since you normally discard the peel, but the zest is the peel so it's important to wash off any pesticides or dirt before zesting.
You might find it easier to handle the orange if you cut it in half and squeeze out the juice before zesting.

, Refrain from using any section of the orange more than once.








, You should now have a pile of orange zest collected on your cutting board. Scoop it into a measuring cup to see how much you have.









One orange should yield about 1 tablespoon of zest. Zest more as needed to use in your recipe.

Hold the microplane at an angle.,
Scrape the orange along the microplane.,
Turn the orange slightly after each scrape.,
Continue scraping and turning until you have zested the entire orange.",How to Zest an Orange3," Rest the tip of the microplane against your cutting board.








, Lightly press the orange against the microplane and scrape it from top to bottom, or from the handle to the tip. Maintain enough pressure to remove the top layer of the rind. Be sure to take off only the rind of the orange's skin, and not the bitter pith inside.








, Avoid using any section of the orange more than once, since you don't want pith mixed in with your zest.








, Gather your zest and measure it in a measuring cup to see how much you still need.

Peel the orange as you would a potato.,
Spin the orange slightly after removing a section of the peel.,
Continue peeling and turning until you peeled around the circumference of the orange.








,
Chop the peel into small pieces.",How to Zest an Orange4," Hold the peeler or knife against the orange's skin. Press down hard enough so that you remove the top layer of the rind. Do not remove the pith inside the orange.








Since this method removes relatively large pieces of rind, rather than fine chopping the pieces, this may be a good place to use that Mini-Processor., Avoid using any section of the orange more than once, since you don't want pith mixed in with the zest.








,, Using a knife or peeler to peel an orange results in large pieces that need to be chopped up so you can use them as zest. Use a sharp knife to chop the peeled pieces finely. Depending upon the volume needed and any appearance concerns, reducing the peels to zest may be a task for the Mini Food Processor, if available. Measure out the amount you need for your recipe."

Rinse the lemon.,
Set your tool over a cutting board.,
Grate the yellow skin only.,
Rotate the lemon and repeat.",How to Zest a Lemon1," Cleaning fruit is especially important when you plan on eating the peel. Scrub vigorously under hot, soap water with your fingers or a clean sponge.;
, A microplane produces a very fine zest, perfect for baking and cooking. If you don't have this tool, use the smallest holes on an ordinary grater. Position it as follows:


Microplane or flat grater: Hold the handle closest to you, with the end set against the cutting board at a 45º angle. If the flat grater is unstable, grate over a bowl with the grater resting against the edge.
Box grater: Place it flat over the cutting board, with the finest side facing the hand holding the lemon. Push down on the handle to prevent sliding.

, Grate just enough to get through the yellow skin, avoiding the bitter white pith underneath. Many graters can pierce through this layer in a single movement. Be gentle if you are not using a microplane.


Graters will only grate in one direction. Microplanes can grate in either, but it's usually easier to push down, then lift the lemon back to the top.

, Once the white pith is exposed, rotate the lemon and zest the next strip of peel. Repeat until most of the peel is removed, or until you have enough zest for your recipe.


There's no need to get every bit from the ends or from flecks of remaining yellow.

Exchange bourbon for vanilla extract.,
Substitute brandy for brandy or rum flavoring, or use fruit juice.,
Replace rum with fruit juices.,
Swap vodka for fruit juices or water.,
Use cactus juice or nectar for tequila.,
Eliminate whiskey altogether in recipes that call for a splash.",How to Substitute Cooking Alcohols1," Bourbon is a sweet kind of whiskey produced in America. To duplicate the sweet flavor imparted by bourbon, use 1½ to 2 tsp (7.4 to 10 ml) of vanilla extract. Mix it into your recipe in the same fashion described for adding the bourbon.For recipes that call for less bourbon or that are suited to lighter intensity sweetness, use less vanilla extract. Recipes suited to strong intensity sweetness will benefit from more extract.Bourbon chicken is a recipe where you easily substitute vanilla for bourbon.;
, For every 2 tsp (10 ml) of brandy needed in a recipe, use ½ to 1 tsp (2.5 to 5 ml) of brandy or rum extract. If larger amounts of brandy are required, use water or fruit juice in the same amount.Brandy frequently has a fruit flavor, like plum or apple. When subbing fruit juice, choose one that has a similar taste to the flavor of brandy called for in the recipe., Fruit juices, like grape juice, pineapple juice, and apple juice work well as rum alternatives. Use the same amount of fruit juice as you would rum. You can also round out the flavor profile of your fruit juice by adding ½ to 1 tsp (2.5 to 5 ml) of nonalcoholic rum, vanilla extract, or almond extract to the juice., Vodka in recipes can be replaced with an equal amount of water. However, to achieve the flavor profile imparted by vodka more closely, mix white grape juice or apple cider with a few drops of lime juice.When using grape or apple cider for vodka, the amount of juice should be the same as the amount called for in the recipe., Tequila is made from a desert plant called agave, and by using juice or nectar from other desert plants, especially cactus, you can recreate the taste of tequila in your cooking. Generally, you should use an equivalent amount of cactus juice or nectar for the tequila., Many recipes only call for a small amount of whiskey. In some recipes, you may see this described as adding a “splash” of whiskey. In many of these situations, you can remove the whiskey from the recipe completely to little effect."

Spin the lettuce.,
Roll the lettuce in a towel.,
Shake the lettuce.,
Swing the lettuce in a towel.,
Store the lettuce.",How to Wash Lettuce," Use a knife or your hands to break the root off of the lettuce and cut off any wilted spots. Separate the leaves of the lettuce with your hands.Be careful when using a knife so you don’t hurt yourself. Make sure your fingers are away from the blade when you cut.;
, If you are using iceberg lettuce, use a paring knife to remove the core then break apart the leaves with your hands. Keep in mind that some iceberg lettuce heads are very firm., Soak your lettuce in a large amount of cold water. Move the water around by swirling the water vigorously. If you got the lettuce from a farmer's market, it will probably be more dirty than from the store.If you are going to dry the lettuce with a spinner, wash the leaves in the bowl and colander that came with your spinner., If you are washing whole heads of lettuce, make sure to thoroughly inspect them. Gently open the heads and check between the leaves for dirt. Gently bend the leaves back and away from the core to allow water to get between the leaves. Make sure to check the area where the leaves are attached to the stem.You can leave the lettuce heads together for grilling., Walk away from the leaves and let the dirt settle to the bottom of the bowl. After about 10 minutes, take the greens out of the water. Make sure not to go near the dirt at the bottom of the bowl. Gently shake the excess water off of the leaves and lay them on a paper towel., The easiest way to dry lettuce is with a spinner. Once the leaves are washed, take the colander, with the lettuce inside, out of the bowl. Pour out any water from the bowl and put the colander back inside the bowl. Put the lid on top of the bowl and turn the handle to spin the lettuce to dry out the leaves.Only dry separated leaves in a spinner, not whole heads., You can dry lettuce by rolling it in a towel. Shake extra water off of the leaves and lay them in a single layer on a towel. Start rolling the towel (starting at the end near you). Lightly press against the green while you roll. If you push too hard, you might bruise the leaves. Unroll the towel and the lettuce should be dry., Drain the lettuce in a colander. Cover the top of the colander with a towel (wrap it around the edges to keep it in place). Shake the colander over the sink, in every direction. When the leaves are dry, take them out., Put the wet lettuce leaves in the center of a towel or a clean pillowcase. Bring all four corners together and twist the towel or pillowcase. Gather the ends in one hand and swing the towel around several times. You probably want to do this outside or in the bathroom because water might splatter., Lay any extra leaves on a paper towel. Roll up the paper towel with the leaves inside. Put the rolled up paper towel in a plastic bag and refrigerate it. It should last for about five to six days."

Trim the fat and calories when making mashed potatoes.One way to make mashed potatoes retain their taste but contain a little less fat and calories is to replace some of them with equal amounts of cauliflower.,
Season your simple meals well.,
Use dried herbs for complex flavor.,
Cut the fat by making and eating soup.,
Remove the fat from soup.,
Remove the solidified fats using a spoon.,
Going through a long cooking process like boiling removes many important nutrients that are found in vegetables.

,
Cook vegetables quickly for best nutrition.,
Remove excess moisture from meat before cooking.,
Keep your wooden cutting board dry.,
Use perforated plastic bags to ripen fruit.,
Check the seasoning for meat by forming a patty with a little bit of meat, then cook it.",How to Simple Tips and Tricks No Cook Should Be Without," Cauliflower has a kind of bland taste that mixes well with potatoes and the other ingredients in them. Cauliflower is also the same texture and color of potatoes when mashed so it's a great way to add more veggies, while lowering calories from classic mashed potatoes;
, When you cook a simple meal, use fresh seasonings and herbs.

, Dried herbs like oregano are better with dishes that are complex.

, When creating soup and stew, try making it lower in fat content by using stocks that have the fat already removed from them. Soup is also lower in fat when it includes veggies and lean meat.

, Once the soup is done and ready to eat, let it chill in the refrigerator for a little while. Any excess fat will harden and rise to the top.

, The calorie savings is around 100 per tablespoon you remove.

,, For the most nutritious vegetables, employ fast cooking methods or, better yet, consume raw veggies.

, Before you cook any ground meat, blot up any excess moisture. It is always wise to blot any moisture that is present on ground meat. If your meat is too moist, then it can affect how it cooks. Basically it just burns away. This can cause the meat to become steamed instead of seared as it should be.

, Always take good care of your wooden cutting board. If you don't keep your wooden cutting board moderately dry and in a cool place, you may find that it warps or cracks. A wooden cutting board will be ruined if it is placed into water.


To restore a damaged board, oil it on a regular basis, using a product specifically designed for wood cutting boards.
Allow your board to dry completely between uses.

, Place any unripened fruit that you buy in a plastic bag that is perforated. As some fruits become more ripe, they can produce ethylene gas.


If you put them in the bag with holds the air will go through the bag, and the gas will stay in, helping the fruits retain their wonderful taste.

, Once you've done this, you can cook the rest of the meat or add additional seasoning as you see fit.

Use a traditional zester for spiral cocktail garnishes.,
Wash the lemon.,
Run the zester across the lemon in long strips.",How to Zest a Lemon2," The original ""zester"" looks like a small claw with tin teeth or sharp holes. This creates thin strips of peel for garnishing drinks.


When a recipe calls for zest, it means finely minced or grated peel instead. You can use this tool, but you'll need to chop the peel finely afterward.
A traditional lemon twist is actually easier to make with a vegetable peeler, as described below.

, Scrub the lemon surface with hot, soapy water. Use an untreated, unwaxed lemon if you can. The wax is usually harmless (and regulated in the US and EU), but it can affect the taste of the drink., Press the teeth of the zester against the skin and drag it across the lemon. For decorative, extra long strips, rotate the lemon as you go.

Wash the lemon.,
Create zest for recipes.,
Create lemon twists for cocktails.",How to Zest a Lemon3," As always, wash your fruit thoroughly with soapy water. You'll be eating this peel, so you don't want any pests or pesticides on it.

, This tools is not ideal if you want the zest for recipes, but it will work if you have no other options. Drag the vegetable peeler slowly and gently over the upper surface of the peel. Try to get as little of the white peel as possible. Once a strip of peel is removed, mince it as finely as you can to create zest.


This zest will be less flavorful than grated zest, and especially microplaned zest. You may want to use more to make up for this, but keep in mind the pieces will also be more noticeable and less attractive.

, Remove a short, wide strip of zest as described above. Hold the strip with the peel side down over the drink, then twist it with your thumbs and forefingers to release oils onto the drink. Rub the strip against the glass rim for additional flavor, then drop it onto the drink surface.The bitter white pith will be especially noticeable in a cocktail. The underside of the strip should have several pores where the yellow skin is visible. If there's a thick white layer instead, carefully scrape off some of the pith with a paring knife."

Choose a sharp, small paring knife.,
Cut off both ends of a clean lemon.,
Slice off a thin strip of zest.,
Remove the white pith.,
Julienne the strip.,
Dice the peel.",How to Zest a Lemon4," The paring knife is probably the most difficult tool for this job, but it has its benefits. You don't have to clog your kitchen with a one-use tool, and a sharp knife makes clean, dry cuts compared to the wet, sticky clumps other methods can produce. Keep reading to learn the technique., After washing the lemon, cut off both ends where they begin to taper. Rest a cut surface flat on the cutting board.

, Cut off a strip of rind from the side of the lemon, right where it meets the white pith. It may be easiest to start near the center of the lemon, where it bulges outward.

, Hold the strip flat against the board with one hand, yellow side down. Press the knife blade flat on top of the strip, with the blade pointing away from your hand. Scrape the top of the strip at a slight angle, removing most of the white pith.

, All this means is ""cut it into thin strips."" To avoid poking your fingers, hold the lemon peel in place with your fingers curled down into a ""claw"" shape. In this position, your knuckles are closer to the blade than your fingertips. As long as you keep the sharp edge of the knife below the level of your knuckles, you are unlikely to hurt yourself even if the knife slips.

, Gather the thin strips in a tight row, than rotate them 90º. Cut the other way using the same technique as above. Try to make the zest pieces as small as possible.

Light beers will only need a normal chicken broth, but you can also use white grape juice or ginger ale.When adding normal chicken broth, white grape juice, or ginger ale, use as much of the substitute as alcoholic beer.
Nonalcoholic beer can also be used as a substitute for beer in recipes that call for this ingredient.Try subbing broth for beer when making beer bratwursts.

, Gewurztraminer is a spicy wine made from white grapes. This makes white grape juice an ideal alternative. Replicate the taste even more closely by adding a few drops of lemon juice to the substitute., Red and white wine both can be substituted with an equal amount of nonalcoholic wine with 1 tbsp (14.8 ml) of white wine vinegar.

Swap licorice liqueurs with licorice flavorings.",How to Substitute Cooking Alcohols3," Amaretto is a liqueur made from almonds. However, because the flavor of almond extract is so concentrated, when subbing it for amaretto you should only use ½ tsp (2.5 ml) for every 2 tbsp (30 ml) of amaretto.If you don’t have almond extract, you can also use an equal amount of Italian soda syrup in place of the amaretto. This syrup can usually be bought at your local grocery store.Use almond extract in place of amaretto to impart a nutty flavor to a tiramisu.

, Chambord is a liqueur with a potent raspberry flavor. Replace it in your recipes with an equal amount of raspberry juice, syrup, or extract.In some cases, you may want to halve the amount of extract you use, as its flavor may be too strong otherwise., For every 2 tbsp (30 ml) of coffee flavored liqueur, like Tia Maria or Kahlua, substitute ½ to 1 tsp (2.5 to 5 ml) of chocolate extract and 1 tsp (5 ml) of instant coffee mixed with 2 tbsp (30 ml) of water. Other substitutes include equal amounts of:Espresso
Nonalcoholic coffee extract
Coffee syrup, Orange flavored liqueurs, like Cointreau and Grand Marnier, are common in recipes. For every 2 tbsp (30 ml) of these liqueurs, use 2 tbsp (30 ml) of orange juice concentrate mixed with ½ tsp (2.5 ml) of orange extract.If you don’t have orange juice concentrate, feel free to use 2 tbsp (30 ml) of regular orange juice with ½ tsp of orange extract., Frangelico has a rich hazelnut flavor that can be difficult to replace. However, when a recipe calls for Frangelico or a hazelnut liqueur, you can replicate the flavor by using an equal amount of hazelnut or almond extract., Liqueurs with a licorice flavor, like Sambuca and Galliano, can often be swapped out for licorice extract. However, you can also use an equal amount of anise flavored Italian soda syrup or fennel."

If measuring by weight (such as ounces or grams), it shouldn't matter whether you sift before or after.;
, Sifting can be messy. Use a large, wide container to minimize cleanup. If your container is not significantly wider than your sifter, you may want to put down paper towels or a plate underneath it to catch spills.


Alternatively, use a large sheet of wax paper. This method is best used with small amounts of sugar at a time. Don't pile the sifted sugar high enough to prevent you from picking up the paper for pouring into another container.

, Add no more than a few spoonfuls to the sifter or strainer at one time, leaving cup-shaped sifters less than 3/4 full. Trying to fill the sifter fuller won't save time, and can cause sugar to spill over the top and make a mess.


A metal can-shaped sifter with a hand crank on the side is an easy, relatively tidy sifting tool. If you do not have one, you can use a fine mesh strainer instead, or see the section on sifting without a sifter.

, Shake the sifter or strainer gently back and forth over the bowl or wax paper. If it has a crank on the side, press it repeatedly with your hand. These motions cause the sugar to shift, sending the fine particles of sugar through the mesh.


Do not shake up and down, and keep motions gentle. If you are too vigorous, you may create a ""cloud"" of powdered sugar that makes a mess of your kitchen.

, If the sugar is lumpy or hard-packed, it is more likely to get stuck in the mesh. If you see the trail of sugar stop or slow almost to a halt, tap the side of the strainer or sifter with a few, short motions of your hand. This should dislodge the stuck particles.

, If your sugar has absorbed moisture and formed lumps, these will not fall through the mesh. Discard these, then add more sugar for sifting. Continue shaking gently until all of the sugar you need has fallen through the mesh.


If sifting before measuring, you may need to stop periodically to find out if you have enough sugar. Transfer the sifted sugar gently to a measuring cup. Do not pack the sifted sugar down.

, Professional bakers typically sift sugar and other dry ingredients in every recipe, but many baking hobbyists try to avoid this sometimes messy or tedious step. If you saw only a couple of pea-sized lumps in your sugar during sifting, or none at all, consider skipping the sifting next time you make cakes, cookies, or other recipes where sugar is one of many ingredients. Sifting is more important when making icing, buttercream, or other decorative toppings in which gritty sugar is easily noticed.


If you want your baked goods to end up airy, light, and even-textured, you can sift the dry ingredients together after they've been mixed.In this case, you do not need to sift the sugar separately unless there are many, obvious lumps that need to be removed before measuring.

Pat the beef prime rib roast with paper towels to dry the meat before seasoning it.,
Place the prime rib in a roasting pan, fat side up.

,
Prepare a paste in a small bowl with enough oil, salt and ground pepper that you’ll use to cover the surface of your roast on all sides.,
Rub the seasoning paste into the meat all over.

,
If you’re going to use garlic to season your roast, cut a dozen or more 1”-deep slits in both the top and bottom of the beef roast using a paring knife.

,
Insert a sliver of garlic clove into each slit.

,
Let the prepared prime rib roast rest in the pan for up to two hours before placing it in the oven.

,
Finished.

",How to Season a Prime Rib Roast," This way, the seasoning sticks to it better during the cooking process.;
,,


Add other rub flavorings, such as mustard seeds or freshly ground coffee, to achieve the taste you desire.
You can omit the oil if you want, but it does a great job of sealing in the juices of the meat during cooking.

Use any fine mesh strainer.,
Whisk sugar with other ingredients instead.,
Use a tea strainer for decorating cookies.",How to Sift Powdered Sugar2," Even many people who bake regularly use a strainer instead of a hand-crank sifter. A small strainer minimizes the amount of mess created. If you only have a wide strainer, such as one for draining vegetables, only use a spoonful or two of sugar at a time to prevent it falling around your bowl rather than into it.


Note that colanders, which drain through holes instead of a wire mesh, do not typically have small enough holes to prevent sugar lumps from falling through.

, If you do not have a sifter or strainer, stirring with a whisk or fork can help you find lumps to remove manually, but this will not be very effective. However, if you are instructed to sift all the dry ingredients in a baking recipe together, whisking them with a whisk or fork is a fine alternative. Just like sifting, whisking adds air to make the mixture fluffier, and helps mix the ingredients evenly together., Sometimes, bakers sift powdered sugar over cookies or other small treats as tasty decoration. A mesh tea strainer may actually work better than a sifter for this purpose, since it shakes the sugar only over a small area.Make sure the tea strainer is well-cleaned and dry, with no strong aroma.

Place your steaks on a countertop or on a cool stovetop to allow them to come to room temperature.,
Coat both sides of the steak with with a liberal amount of salt and pepper.,
Know that the type of grill you have will slightly change the flavor of your steaks.",How to Sear Steaks on the Grill1," Keep them covered or inside their packaging until you are ready to cook them. When the steak is at room temperature, it can quickly get to high-heat on the grill. Leave it cold and the centers will take too long to cook.;
, This will help you to create a crisper crust on the outside of your steak. Think of the salt as a light snow on a dark road -- you can still see the steak, but there is a light dusting on the entire piece of meat.


Use the biggest grains of salt you can, such as course or kosher salt. Bigger grains dissolve slower, leading to a better crust on your steak., Depending on your grill, you can get very different flavors from your steak:



Propane (Sear Burner): Gas grills don't give much flavor to the meat, but they are easy to adjust and toy with to get the perfect heat. They also get hot much, much faster than other grills.

Charcoal: The classic choice, charcoal briquettes light up and get hot faster than woodchips. They give the classic rich, smoky flavor to the steaks.

Wood-fire: Hickory or oak chips often give the best flavor to the meat. The trade-off? They are harder to light and keep ablaze. You can also use a mixture of charcoal and wood instead of just wood-chips."

Set out the eggs.,
Separate the whites from the yolks, if necessary.,
Figure out how much you need to whisk your egg whites.,
Select a clean, dry glass, copper, or stainless steel bowl.,
Choose a clean balloon whisk with many thin wires.,
Hold the whisk firmly and begin to slowly whisk the egg whites.,
Add cream of tartar to your egg whites once they are foamy.,
Increase your speed.",How to Whisk Eggs1," Place your eggs on your counter about 30 minutes before you intend to use them. Eggs whip to a greater volume when they’re at room temperature (between 68° and 70° Fahrenheit or between 20° and 25° Celsius.If you’re short on time, you can place whole eggs in a bowl of warm water for 5 to 10 minutes to bring them to room temperature quickly. If you only need egg whites for your recipe, separate the eggs while they’re still cold. The white and yolk will separate easier before they warm up to room temperature.;
, Crack your egg as close to the middle as possible. Let the yolk settle in the bottom half of the shell and let the egg whites run into the bowl. Then use the shell halves to transfer the egg back-and-forth until all of the whites are in the bowl.


You can also crack the egg into your opened hand. Keep the yolk in the palm of your hand while letting the whites slide through your fingertips into the bowls.
Use a small bowl to catch your egg whites, then transfer them to your larger mixing bowl. That way, you can help prevent any yolk from getting into the rest of your ingredients.

, Depending on your recipe, your egg whites will need to achieve either soft, firm, or stiff peaks.


Soft peaks are those just starting to hold their shape. If you stop whisking and turn your whisk upside down, the peaks will hold for a second before melting back into themselves.Some recipes ask you to whip the whites to a soft peak stage before adding other ingredients, like sugar.
Firm, or medium, peaks hold their shape longer than soft peaks, but they gradually lose their form, and their peaks flop over.Stiff peaks stand firm when the whisk is turned upside down. The egg white mixture will be stiff and heavy at this stage.Recipes for meringues require you to whisk or beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.

, Never use a plastic bowl to whisk egg whites. The tiny nicks and scratches in plastic bowls can interfere with the smooth whisking of the egg whites.Chefs prefer copper bowls, because tiny amounts of copper ions combine with the egg whites and help make the egg whites more stable. Additionally, it is difficult to overbeat eggs in a copper bowl.Copper bowls are expensive, so home chefs typically use glass or stainless steel bowls.

, Balloon whisks are characterized by their large, round heads, useful for beating air into egg whites efficiently.Whisks with at least eight sturdy, flexible wires are best for whipping egg whites., Use your other hand to hold onto the bowl.Use a circular motion and make about two rotations around the bowl per second. After about 30 seconds, your egg whites will begin to look foamy.


You can also try using a figure-eight motion in this step.Keep your egg whites moving constantly and occasionally lift the whisk to incorporate even more air into them.

, This acidic by-product from the winemaking process adds stability to your egg whites.The addition of cream of tartar is not necessary if you are using a copper bowl.

, Continue to whisk your eggs in a quick, circular motion; you should notice an increase in volume after 2 or 3 minutes of continuous whisking.


As you continue to whip more air into your egg whites, you should reach maximum volume for them in 12–18 minutes.Whisking whites by hand to a stiff peak stage requires tremendous arm strength and much time. It will take several minutes to achieve stiff peaks when whisking by hand.

Cut the vegetables.,
Choose the right pan.,
Add oil or fat.,
Heat the pan.",How to Sauté Vegetables1," The first step is to prepare the vegetables by cutting them into bite-sized pieces.Do your best to make the pieces the same size.








If your vegetables are not the same size (and especially the same thickness), they won't finish cooking at the same time. When you take your vegetables out of the pan, some will either be over or under-cooked.;
, In theory, you can saute vegetables in any pan, but some work better than others. A wide saute pan with straight sides or a skillet with sloped sides works best.Your pan should have have a dense bottom so as to distribute heat evenly.
A stainless steel, non-stick, aluminum, or anodized pan will work well.

, Choose an oil or fat to saute your vegetables in. Butter or any kind of oil will work. You can also use bacon fat, though this option is less healthy.









While any oil will work, oils with a high smoke-point such as canola oil, peanut oil, and regular olive oil work best. Oils with a lower smoke points like extra virgin olive oil nut-infused oils can be used, but often lose their flavor when cooked at high temperatures., Turn your burner up to medium-high and allow the pan and oil to heat up."
"
Understand the theory behind a sear burner.,
Preheat the sear burner on your gas grill using the high setting.,
Place 1 or 2 steaks on your sear burner.,
Sear the steaks for 1-1/2 minutes on the first side.,
Place the steaks on your medium heat burner and close the lid so that they can continue to cook through.,
Check for doneness using the palm test.,
Let the steaks stand before eating.",How to Sear Steaks on the Grill2," A sear burner is a separate section of a gas grill that has an infrared plate to create extremely high temperatures. Sear your steaks on this burner and then move them to a cooler section of the grill to cook them through. You do not need to close the lid while the steaks are searing.

, Preheat another burner on your gas grill at a medium setting. Coat the burners with nonstick cooking spray.

, The quantity will depend on the size of your steaks and the size of your burner. Make sure that you have at least 2” (5 centimeters) of space between the pieces of meat so that they can cook evenly.

, Flip the steaks over using a pair of tongs and sear them for an additional 1-1/2 minutes on the other side. Each side of the steaks should have a crisp, caramelized crust that is brown without being burnt., Use a meat thermometer to ensure that your steaks are cooked to the right temperature depending on your preference for doneness.

, You can use your own hand to check how done your steaks are, making sure you get it off perfectly each and every time. Simply press one finger into the steak and compare the feeling to various parts of your hand. To check doneness with your hand:



Raw: Touch the fleshy part of your palm right underneath the thumb. It should have a lot of give.

Well done: Touch your thumb and pinky together on the same hand. Then touch the fleshy part under your thumb with the opposite hand. It will be firm.

Medium: Touch your thumb and ring finger together, then check the palm. It will be a little less firm.

Medium Rare: Touch the thumb and middle fingers, then check the palm.

Rare: Touch the thumb and pointer, then check the palm., Standing the meat refers to letting it sit, uncut, for 5-6 minutes. This allows the meat to reabsorb the juices and fats that liquefied in the high heat, and will lead to a juicier, better tasting steak every time."
"
Get the cooking grate as close to the coals as possible.,
Place coals in the grill at least 2 layers deep.,
Get the right heat for your preferred steak doneness.,
Coat the grate with nonstick cooking spray before you light the coals.,
Place the steaks on the grill rack.,
Cook the steak for 1-1/2 minutes before flipping it over using a pair of tongs.,
Move the steak to the cooler portion of the grill and cook it until it reaches your desired interior temperature.,
Check for doneness using your palm as a guideline.,
Let the meat stand for 5 minutes before cutting.,
Finished.

",How to Sear Steaks on the Grill3," Placing the grate 2 to 3 inches above the coals will create high direct heat for searing your steaks. Make sure one section of the grate has no coals under it; that safe zone will stay cooler for cooking the interior of your steak.

, Position the grate so that it is 2 to 3 inches above the coals. Leave a safe zone with no coals for cooking the interior of the meat.

, Aim to get the inside of the grill to 400°F if you have a grill thermometer. The thinner your steaks are, the hotter you want the grill. This is because you don't want to cook the inside of the steak before the outside is a nice, crispy brown:



1/2 inch thick: 425-450°F. You shouldn't be able to hold your hand over the grill for more than 3 seconds.

3/4-1 inch thick: 360-400°F You shouldn't be able to hold your hand over the grill for more than 4-5 seconds.

1-1 1/2 inch thick: 325-360°F You shouldn't be able to hold your hand over the grill for more than 5-6 seconds., Then, light the coals directly or light them using a charcoal starter. Allow the temperature to reach 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 C) before placing the steaks on the grill.

, The number of steaks that you can sear at one time will depend on both the size of your grill and the size of your steaks. Make sure that you leave at least a 2” (5 centimeter) clearance around the meat for even cooking.

, Cook the second side for 1-1/2 minutes. You should have a crispy brown crust on both sides of the meat., You can use your fingers to press on the steak and check it's doneness:

, You can use the fleshy part of your hand underneath the thumb to test out your steaks. To do so, simply press one finger into the center of the steak, then compare it against the following benchmarks.



Raw: Touch the fleshy part of your palm right underneath the thumb. It should have a lot of give.

Well done: Using the same hand, touch your thumb and pinky together. For comparison, touch the fleshy part under your thumb with the opposite hand, holding your thumb and pinky together. It will be firm.

Medium: Touch your thumb and ring finger, then check underneath your thumb. It will be a little less firm than the well-done version.

Medium Rare: Touch the thumb and middle together, then check your palm.

Rare: Touch the thumb and pointer fingers, then check your palm., If you cut into a hot steak right as it comes off the grill it will lose delicious juices. Resist the urge and place a piece of aluminum foil over the meat for 5 minutes or so, then dig in and enjoy.,"
"
Select either a stand or a hand-held mixer.,
Whisk your egg whites at low speed until foamy, for about one minute.,
Increase the speed gradually and continue to whisk your eggs.,
Keep an eye on your whites.",How to Whisk Eggs2," These electric mixers are essentially motorized whisks.They enable you to achieve the proper consistency for your eggs in a fraction of the time of hand whisking.


Handheld electric mixers are less expensive than stand mixers, and they are easier to store.
Stand mixers offer the advantage of keeping your hands free to do other jobs in the kitchen while your eggs are being beaten. Use the whisk attachment with your stand mixer.

, If you immediately start to whisk them at high speed, they will not reach their full volume.Add a pinch of cream of tartar at the foamy stage to help stabilize the whites.

, Your egg whites should reach their full volume within a few minutes.


Since handheld mixers are not as powerful as stand mixers, you may have to use the high speed to achieve the consistency required by your recipe.
If using a stand mixer, which is quite powerful, do not go above the medium-high speed. Your mixture will have more stable, smaller bubbles if you don’t use the highest speed on your stand mixer, It is easy to step away from a stand mixer, but doing so risks over-whipping your egg whites.


Over-whipped whites look dry and curdled or grainy and clumpy.The structure of the whites will break down, and liquid will then weep out of the mixture.
You can try to salvage overbeaten egg whites by beating in another egg white. This may help the mixture recover its structure. Otherwise, throw everything out and start again.

Select fresh eggs when baking.,
Use the whisk attachment on your stand mixer.,
Combine eggs and sugar according to your recipe.,
Continue beating until the mixture is pale yellow.,
Check for ribboning.",How to Whisk Eggs3," When beaten, fresher eggs will achieve more loft and greater stability than older eggs., This will help you achieve the ribbon stage more quickly than by using a hand mixer.


If you use a hand mixer, be sure to circulate it through the mixture while beating to achieve the proper loft., Whisk your eggs and sugar together until the sugar is thoroughly dissolved. This will ensure that your egg mixture won’t become granular when heated, and the batter will have the necessary thickness and loft.

, As more air is incorporated into your mixture, the deep yellow color will lighten and your mixture will thicken., Once your mixture is the right color, lift a beater out of the bowl. If some of the mixture falls back into bowl and forms a ribbon-like stream that holds its shape for a few seconds, you have reached the ribbon stage.Batters that aren’t whisked long enough to attain the ribbon stage will result in dense, rubbery cakes."

Wait for oil to shimmer.,
Add flavoring ingredients.,
Add your vegetables.,
Toss or stir.,
Cook until done.,
Season as desired.,
Remove from pan.",How to Sauté Vegetables2," When the oil shimmers, it is hot enough to cook your vegetables.If you put them in before this, the oil won't be hot enough to brown them, and they may stick to the bottom of the pan.In adequate light, hot oil will become iridescent and colorful. When it takes on these characteristics, it's ready.

, If you are adding spicy ingredients like garlic or hot peppers, it's usually a good idea to add them first, as they will impart some of their flavor to the oil.









Minced garlic typically should be added one minute before the other vegetables.Hot peppers like jalapenos can be added five minutes before the other vegetables., Don't overcrowd the pan. You can cover the bottom, but you don't want more than one layer of vegetables.








If the vegetables are piled on top of each other, the steam from the lower vegetables may become trapped. The result can be steamed vegetables rather than sauteed ones.
If you have too many vegetables to fit in the pan without overcrowding, cook them in two or more batches.

, Turn your vegetables frequently by tossing or stirring them. This ensures even cooking on all sides.








You should NOT stir constantly, as you would with a stir fry. A few stirs should do the trick, depending on how long the vegetables need to cook.

, How long this takes will depend on the type of vegetables. Between three and ten minutes is typical, but you'll probably need to experiment some to get this right.








Vegetables with the longest cooking times include carrots, onions, and hearty greens like collards. These can take 10-15 minutes. Potatoes can take even longer, and some people simmer them in water first to make them saute more quickly.Vegetables with medium cooking times include broccoli, cauliflower, bell peppers, and Brussels sprouts. These can take eight to 10 minutes.Vegetables with short cooking times include mushrooms, corn, tomatoes, and asparagus. These can cook in as little as two minutes.Spinach and other greens have the shortest cooking times, as they will quickly wilt. A minute or two should do it.
If you are cooking vegetables with different cooking times in the same pan, add the ones that need to be cooked longest first, let them cook partially, and then add the vegetables that require less cooking time. Or, cook individually and then mix.

, Right before the vegetables are done, add any seasonings you wish to include. This could include salt and pepper, soy sauce, citrus juice, vegetable stock, oregano, or other dried herbs.Ingredients such as these should generally be in the pan for about one minute.

, When vegetables are done, remove from the pan quickly to avoid overcooking. Serve and enjoy!

Prepare vegetables and pan.,
Add water and vegetables.,
Cover with parchment paper.,
Remove parchment and caramelize.",How to Sauté Vegetables3," An alternative way to saute vegetables, for an especially tender texture, is to use a piece of parchment paper. For this variation, cut the vegetables and heat the pan as normalUse a pat of butter for your cooking fat.

, Next, add just a small splash of water, salt and pepper, and your vegetables. Again, be careful not to overcrowd the pan.

, Cover the pan loosely with a piece of parchment paper. Check the vegetables regularly. Wait for the water to evaporate.

, When the water has evaporated, remove the parchment and cook for a couple more minutes, allowing the butter to caramelize the vegetables.

Use the hot-pan-cold-oil trick.,
Adjust your cooking temperatures.,
Warm foods previous to cooking.,
Do not overfill your pans.,
Avoid PAM and other non-stick sprays.,
Always maintain a Teflon coating.,
Use stainless steel pans for sauces, liquids, and acidic foods.,
Use non-stick pans for eggs and similarly sticky items.,
Use copper pans for high heat meals.,
Put salt in the bottom of the pan.,
Add in oil.,
Heat the pan.,
Let it cool.,
Wipe it out.",How to Season a Stainless Steel Pan," The best way to keep items from sticking when cooking with stainless steel pans is to start by preheating the pan. Preheat over medium heat, never high heat, and pour in butter or oil just before adding your food., Cooking at too high a temperature can easily cause food to stick to a pan. Remember: the HIGH setting on your stove is for boiling water and deep frying but not much else. Lower the temperature at which you cook food to avoid sticking and burning.

, Cold food on a hot pan will often cause it to stick. Avoid this issue by taking food out of the refrigerator before you cook it and allow it to come to room temperature. Just don't leave it out for too long!

, Putting in too much food can really mess with the the temperature balance of your pan, creating sticky situations. This can also cause your food to cook unevenly!

, These sprays can leave behind a residue which creates a lot more stick than it solves, especially around the edges of a pan where the spray is not burned off.

, If your pans have a non-stick coating, you need to work to maintain that coating. Never use metal tools on a non-stick pan, don't use too high a heat, and never, EVER scrub the pan with abrasive materials like a scrubbing sponge or metal sponge.

, Stainless steel pans work best when cooking sauces, reductions, and other liquid food items. They are also useful for acidic foods, since non-stick and other types of pans will react with acidic foods and degrade over time.

, Teflon, cast iron, or carbon steel pans (the last two of which should be seasoned) are the pans that you should use for sticky items like meat, eggs, and pancakes.

, Copper pans are best for items that are very heat sensitive or need to get very hot (high heats are unsafe for other types of pans). They need to be properly oiled first but these are the pans that you should use for quick sautés and other high-heat foods.

, Put a few spoonfuls of salt in the bottom of the pan.

, Add in a high-heat oil, like peanut oil.

, Heat the pan on high heat until the oil smokes.

, Turn the heat off and allow it to cool.

, Once the oil is safe to handle, pour it out and wipe down the pan with a paper towel or a cloth. Remember, once a pan is seasoned it should never be washed.

Review what you already have on hand in your kitchen.,
Reduce the amount of meat that you eat, or buy cheaper cuts.,
Drink water at meals instead of buying pop, juice, energy drinks, smoothies and more.,
Invest in a slow cooker, also known as a crock pot.,
Reduce food waste.,
Adjust how you cook according to the season.",How to Save Money on Cooking1," One of the keys to cooking frugally is using what you already have, instead of just buying more. Make it a goal to use up almost all of your pantry or refrigerator before you go shopping, and you will find yourself wasting less food that goes off after its expiration date.


This may mean you need to be more creative with your cooking. However, you will find that many websites, like Epicurious, Real Simple or Cooking Light allow you to search by ingredient. You can even find phone or tablet applications that let you select an ingredient and give you recipe options.;
, For many families, meat is the easiest way to get protein to their family. Choose pork shoulder, cube steaks, chicken thighs, or whole chickens or turkeys, which are more likely to be cheaper.

, Water is free from the tap, and excluding other drinks from your shopping list is 1 of the best ways to save on your cooking bills., Slow cooking is the best way to make a meal out of cheaper cuts of meat. Many slow cookers come with recipe books, or you can look online, for the best way to cook anything from steak, to whole chickens, to chili, just by dropping some simple ingredients in the pot and letting them slowly cook for 4 to 8 hours.

, The following are ways to reduce waste while you shop and cook:


Buy smaller fruit. While fruit is essential for fiber and nutrients, most people buy apples, pears, bananas, and other fruit that are too large for what your child or you want to eat. Instead of throwing the excess away, you can save money when you buy smaller fruit by weight.
Have a leftover night. Cooking for a family often means leftovers. Plan out a menu, like you are at a restaurant, and everyone can have all or part of their favorite meal from the week.
Pay attention to what your family throws away after meals or snacks. Adjust their portions accordingly, so you are giving them what they usually eat. They can always ask for a second helping if they are hungry.
Freeze leftovers if they will make a whole meal, but you don't have time to eat them within the next few days. This is a great plan for soup, chili, cooked potatoes, casseroles and more. You will appreciate that extra meal when you find yourself without time to cook.

, Many websites and magazines post recipes for what is in season. The following ways can help you save money on your meals:


Buy what is in season. After a run through the produce section, it should be obvious what is in season and what isn't. A pineapple can cost $1.99 and be a dessert, where a small packet of blueberries is $6. Shop at a local farmer's market, and you will save money by paying attention to what is in over-abundance at the time.
Serve fruit as a dessert. You can make parfaits with yogurt. You can serve strawberries with cream, or you can just sprinkle a small amount of sugar on top to entice a family that is used to baked goods. This is healthier and cheaper.
Add leafy greens and cans of beans to your stock. Dark green lettuce and beans are cheap and they add a great amount of nutrition to your diet. Learn to make creative salads and add beans to casseroles and stews.

"
Become a coupon clipper.,
Buy the items you use constantly in bulk.,
Shop at a few different stores.,
Reduce your processed foods, such as cookies, candy, lunch meat, cheese, and other packaged meals.",How to Save Money on Cooking2," Luckily, coupons are available online, in newspapers and at the checkout line. Buy an envelope to organize coupons and leave it in the car. Plan your purchases according to what's on sale that week and you will shave money off your weekly grocery bill.


Throw away coupons for things that you would not normally buy. Just because an offer is attractive, it doesn't mean it is a good cooking choice. Stick to the things you know you need, not offers for new products.

, Also, buy with coupons from the store, if possible. Stores like Costco send out coupon booklets, so buy your toilet paper, toothpaste, lotion, roasts, yogurt or frozen foods according to the coupons sales.


Remember that you should not buy everything in bulk. Just like grocery stores, bulk stores have attractive offers on DVDs, large jars of olives, frozen appetizers, cakes, chips and other things that are unnecessary or unhealthy. Limit your bulk purchases, and shop alone, if you find your spouse or kids are big impulse buyers.
Bulk store memberships often require you to pay a yearly fee. If you plan to buy your toiletries, shop regularly or get gas from the store, this is very likely to pay off within a few months' time.

, For instance, you may save money on toilet paper by shopping at a bulk store, but your coupon at the local supermarket saves you money on bread. Figure out a monthly shopping plan that includes discount stores, supermarkets and bulk stores.


Make sure you sign up for the local supermarket's ""club."" Most supermarkets have a card that you are required to swipe in order to get a discount. Although almost everyone uses them, you save a considerable amount of money by following the practice.

, Many stores package cut foods and mark up the price. Buy the large head of broccoli or the pineapple and cut it yourself.


Many nutrition experts suggest that you stay near the outside of a supermarket. Most of the processed, high-calorie food is contained within the aisles. Try shopping the perimeter first, before you delve into the aisles for a few items.

Buy good-looking onions.,
Cut up the onions into small pieces.,
Turn on the stove or electric frying pan to medium-high heat.,
Oil the pan.,
Put in the onions.,
Continue cooking until soft and light brown.",How to Sauté Onions1," You want the kind that are free of blemishes and that are heavy and firm. A little goes a long way, so don't get too many. One or two is usually enough for a family of 5, depending on the size of the onion.


1 large onion is about 1 cup (8 oz) of chopped onion. To gauge your recipe, go from there.;
, This part is a matter of personal preference or recipe -- chopped, sliced, diced; however you want 'em, it'll work.


Want to avoid crying while dealing with the onions? Chill them first -- cold onions will be nicer on your eyes. Then, chop them under water, next to a candle, or wear swimmer's goggles.

, Sautéing involves heating up a substance very quickly at a high temperature, so make sure your pan gets hot before you start.

, Once the pan is hot enough, pour in some oil. Don't overdo it initially; you can always add more. Put in enough to spread all over the bottom of the pan. You should end up using about 1 tablespoon (15 g) per onion.When it comes to oil, olive oil is a good choice. Butter is also a tasty fat for sauteed onions. If you're going super low fat, consider using vegetable or chicken broth., As they cook, have a spatula on hand to push them around the pan so they don't stick. If you're getting fancy, do that flipping move you see the pros do when they're sautéing. But be careful; splashing oil on yourself is not a pleasant experience.


Keep those suckers moving. You don't want half to be white and raw and the other half almost black. Onions cook very quickly, so stay by the pan's side, constantly moving 'em around to avoid crowding.







, When the onions are done (should take around 5-7 minutes) turn off the pan and spoon the onions into another bowl to cool off before you serve them. Or add them to another part of the meal, such as sauce, or just eat them then and there!

Bring them to a potluck.",How to Saute Potatoes," Use a vegetable brush and scrub the potatoes under clean running water to remove dirt and other particles. You don’t have to peel the potatoes to cook them this way, so it’s important to wash them thoroughly first. The best potatoes for sautéing are small waxy ones with thin skins, including:Charlotte
Maris piper
Desirée
King Edward;
, Transfer the potatoes to a clean towel and pat them dry. Use a sharp knife to carefully cut the potatoes. For sautéed potatoes, you can cube them, slice them, or halve them:

For cubes, cut each potato into half-inch (1.3-cm) chunksFor rounds, slice the potatoes into half-inch (1.3-cm) disksFor halves, simply cut each potato in half lengthwise, Fill a medium pot halfway with water. Put on the lid and bring the water to a boil over medium heat. When the water is boiling, add the potatoes. Return the water to a boil and cook the potatoes in the boiling water for four to five minutes.Parboiling the potatoes like this will partially cook and gently soften them, and this means they’ll cook evenly through when you sauté them.

, After three minutes, remove the potatoes from the heat. Drain them in a colander. Place the colander inside the pot and let the potatoes drain for about five minutes. This will give the potatoes time to dry, which will make for crispier sautéed potatoes., Turn the oven to 350 F (177 C) and let it come to temperature. You will likely have to fry the potatoes in batches, and you can keep the cooked batches warm in the oven while the others sauté., Pour the oil into a large skillet or frying pan. Turn the heat to medium and let the oil preheat. The oil is ready when the surface begins to shimmer, but you don’t want it to start smoking.


Good oils for sautéing potatoes include canola and sunflower.
Instead of cooking the potatoes in oil and adding butter later, you can also sauté them in duck fat or another animal fat., When the oil is ready, transfer the potatoes to the hot pan. For cubes, spread the potato chunks out into an even layer. For rounds, place each round in the pan individually, and spread the rounds out in a single layer. For halves, place each potato cut-side down into the pan.

Cook only a single layer of potatoes at a time to ensure even cooking and browning. You may have to cook them in batches., Sauté the potatoes in the hot oil for about five minutes. When they become golden brown on the one side, use a thin spatula to flip the potatoes. Cook for another five minutes, or until they're golden brown on both sides., Once you flip the potatoes, wait about three minutes and then add the butter, garlic, and rosemary to the pan. Season with a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Shake the pan to distribute the new ingredients evenly. Continue cooking for another two minutes or so, until the potatoes are cooked through and browned.

Once fully cooked, toss the potatoes a few times with the spatula to coat them in the garlic and rosemary., When the first batch of potatoes is done, transfer them to a baking sheet. Spread the potatoes out into a single layer and transfer them to the oven to keep warm while you sauté the remaining potatoes., Add more oil to the pan and let it preheat. When the oil is hot, arrange the remaining potatoes in the pan and cook them for about 10 minutes, until golden brown. Flip the potatoes regularly, and add more butter, rosemary, and the garlic in the last few minutes of cooking., When all the potatoes are cooked, transfer them from the baking sheet or frying pan to a serving bowl. Add additional salt and pepper, to taste, if necessary.Toss the potatoes to coat them in the seasoning before serving.

Sautéed potatoes can be eaten alone, as a side dish with your favorite meals, or turned into tasty salads.

, A big bowl of hot sautéed potatoes is a delicious and filling snack. Potatoes are a good source of carbohydrates, fiber, potassium, and vitamin C. They also contain protein, iron, and calcium, making them a nutritious snack.Just don’t go too heavy on the oil and butter!, Sautéed potatoes are an excellent side dish, and they're a popular add-on for pork chops.For a more balanced meal, serve the pork chop with the sautéed potatoes, a dollop of dairy or non-dairy sour cream, and some steamed vegetables., Steak and potatoes is a classic combination, and sautéed potatoes are an excellent addition to braised, broiled, pan seared, or barbecued steak.You can serve this meal with steamed broccoli, roasted asparagus, or a fresh garden salad., Sauté cubed potatoes until golden brown, and then transfer them to a plate. Add more oil to the pan and stir fry chopped onions, mushrooms, peppers, and other favorite vegetables for five to 10 minutes. Add the potatoes back to the pan for the last few minutes of cooking and toss everything to combine all the vegetables., Potato salad is another delicious and creative way to serve and eat potatoes, and there's no end to the types of salad you can make. You can use cold leftover sautéed potatoes in place of boiled potatoes in any potato salad, including classic, country, veggie, Italian, and more., Potatoes pair well with a variety of other mains and side dishes. They're also very popular, making sautéed potatoes a great choice to bring to a pot luck style party, barbecue, picnic, or other gathering. To change the flavor of the potatoes, you can add other herbs and spices, including:Chopped chives
Tarragon
Parsley

, The great part about this recipe (apart from when you're finished and get to taste it, of course) is that you only have to peel the onions. No slicing, dicing, and crying required.

, Get it very, very hot. You're going to flash the onions with a bit of heat initially, to get the process rolling.


If you're thinking ahead, peel the onions while the stove is heating up. Not only can you cook, but you can multitask, too!

, And you thought that stuff was just for salad dressing! Toss the onions around, adequately covering them in the vinegar and oil and season with salt and pepper to taste. If you're particularly keen on another spice, add it now.

Combine vinegar and Dijon mustard for added depth.",How to Saute Asparagus," The tips of good asparagus spears should be tight. No part of the spear should be mushy.Choose spears that are relatively equal in thickness for cooking. The spears can be thick or thin, however.






Thin asparagus is tender and has a crisp center.
Thick asparagus has more crunch and a meatier center.

;
, Place the asparagus in a colander and run the batch under cold, running water to remove any sandy soil clinging to the tips.


For especially sandy or dirty asparagus, you may need to gently scrub the tips with your fingers to remove the debris. You do not need to use a vegetable brush, though.
Pat dry with clean paper towels when done.

, The woody part of the stem is usually located around the bottom third of the spear. This part is not appetizing and should be snapped off by hand.


Find the woody base by gently bending the spear at different places. The ""right"" breaking point should be obvious and will be easy to spot, as it will be the point at which the spear turns tender.






You can snap the woody part off with your hands. You do not need to use a knife.







, If the scales on each spear bother you, you can use a vegetable peeler to scrape this portion of the outer spear off. The spear will look smoother and cleaner when done.


This is most helpful when dealing with thick spears of asparagus.
If using thick asparagus, use a vegetable peeler to also remove the woody outer skin 2 inches (5 cm) up from the stem end.







, If the asparagus is especially long or especially thick, you might find it easier to cook them by cutting them into pieces.


For longer spears, cut the asparagus into two or three separate sections that are each of equal length.
For thicker spears, cut the asparagus in half lengthwise.

, Before you add any fat to the skillet, bring it up to temperature by heating the empty pan over a medium heat.


This should only take a minute or two. The fat is hot enough when you can drop 1 tsp (5 ml) of water onto the surface and see it immediately evaporate into steam.

, Add 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of olive oil or butter to the hot skillet. Continue heating the fat over medium heat for another minute or so.


Do not let the oil smoke now or at any point during the cooking process. If this happens, the fat is starting to break down, and the asparagus will develop an unpleasant taste.

, Carefully transfer your asparagus to the hot oil in your skillet. Season with a dash of salt and pepper as desired.


Use tongs to place the spears in the pan to minimize the risk of accidentally burning yourself with hot oil.






Make sure that the asparagus lays flat in a single layer inside the pan. If you cannot fit all of the asparagus in the pan at once, cook it in batches.

, Keep the skillet uncovered and keep the asparagus moving by gently shifting the pan or stirring the asparagus with a heat-resistant spatula.


When done, the asparagus should turn a brighter green and still have a little crunch.

, The asparagus will taste best and have the most crunch if served right after you finish cooking it.

, Even shallots, though milder, are a splendid option.


Add minced or chopped garlic, onion, or shallots to the hot oil before you add the asparagus. Cook these aromatic ingredients for 1 minute until they soften and become more fragrant.
After the garlic or onion releases its full flavor, add the asparagus to the pan and cook until done, stirring well to mix the flavors fully.

, The tangy flavors of cheeses like Parmesan or Feta match well with the woodiness of cooked asparagus.After you finish sauteing the asparagus, transfer it to a serving plate and sprinkle it with either Parmesan or Feta cheese. Let the cheese sit on the asparagus for another minute until it begins to melt slightly.
You can also mix and match flavors by adding cheese to asparagus cooked with garlic, shallots, onion, mushrooms, shrimp, bacon, or herbs.

, Sauté the mushrooms alongside the asparagus in the same pan until tender.

Chop the mushrooms into fine pieces before adding them to the skillet with the asparagus. The two ingredients should take similar amounts of time to cook. When done, the mushrooms will be tender.
Since many mushrooms do not have strong flavors on their own, you can also add other, more potent ingredients, like aromatic garlic or a simple dressing.

, Sauté shrimp separately for 3 minutes or until done and toss the seafood favorite with the cooked asparagus to serve.If you cook the shrimp and the asparagus in the same pan, you will likely end up overcrowding the pan. As a result, the ingredients may not cook thoroughly or evenly.
Cook the asparagus first before removing them from the pan. Keep warm as you cook the shrimp in the same pan.
Once the shrimp is cooked, add the asparagus back to the pan and cook, stirring, until reheated.

, Cook the bacon in your skillet before you Sauté the asparagus. That way, you can use the rendered bacon fat as your oil instead of olive oil or butter.Fry the bacon over medium heat for 5 minutes or until crispy on both sides. Remove from the heat and drain on paper towels. Once drained, crumble into small pieces.
Meanwhile, cook the asparagus in the bacon grease left in the pan. Once done, add the crumbled bacon back into the skillet and toss until evenly mixed.

, Herbs are a good way to bump up the flavor and reduce the sodium.


Tarragon, thyme, marjoram, and parsley are all good options to consider.
Add 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of fresh herbs to the asparagus immediately after it finishes cooking. Toss to coat well.
If using dried herbs instead of fresh herbs, use 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) instead.

, An acid brightens the flavor of asparagus, giving it an added zing that it would otherwise lack.Coat the asparagus with the lemon juice after you finish cooking it. Remove the cooked asparagus from the heat, add 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) lemon juice, and toss gently with a spatula or mixing spoon until well coated.

, As with lemon juice, adding an acid can brighten the flavor of asparagus. When using vinegar for that acid, however, you should choose a slightly sweeter variety rather than a plain white vinegar.

Sherry vinegar, red wine vinegar, and balsamic vinegar are all good options to consider.
Once the asparagus is completely cooked, remove it from the heat and add 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of your vinegar of choice. Toss well to coat.

, Adding a bit of Dijon mustard at the end of the cooking process is a simple yet effective way to coat the asparagus in something flavorful.

Wait until after the cooked asparagus comes off the heat before adding the mustard. Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of Dijon mustard to the asparagus and toss well to coat.
If you do not have Dijon mustard, you could use honey mustard, instead.

, If you are interested in a more complex flavor, make a vinaigrette from 2 tsp (10 ml) Dijon mustard, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) red wine vinegar, and 2 Tbsp (30 ml) olive oil.Whisk the mustard, vinegar, and oil together in a small bowl. Set aside as you cook the asparagus.
Once the asparagus is ready to come off the stove, add the vinaigrette to the pan and toss well to coat.

This way you can stir in additional cream more easily. If you reheat frozen potatoes straight from the freezer, allow extra cooking time in the beginning until they've warmed and softened enough to stir the cream in effectively.;
, First, pour some cream. Bring it to a simmer. Stir your mashed potatoes into the cream evenly. Continue to stir until the potatoes are heated through. If needed, add more cream and wait for it to come to a simmer, then stir it into the potatoes.Depending on the amount of potatoes you’re reheating and the size of the pan, it’s best to start off with too little cream than too much. At the very least, use enough to coat the bottom of the pan.

When using a charcoal grill, build your charcoal to either one side of the grill or around the outer edge of the grill. Because of the extensive roasting time, you will have to add more charcoal during cooking.
When using a gas grill, lower all the burners. The drip pan will shield the heat from being directly under the meat.;
, Put 1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) of water into the drip pan. This will help baste the meat as it rotates.


For extra flavoring, put herbs, spices, juice, beer or wine into the drip pan with the water.

, Reduce the temperature of the grill to medium low for the rest of the cooking.

Preheat your oven.,
Prepare the vegetables.,
Prepare the pan.,
Toss the vegetables with oil and seasoning.,
Place the vegetables on the baking sheet.,
Roast the vegetables.,
Serve.",How to Roast Vegetables1," Preheat your oven to anywhere between 400 and 450 degrees F. Vegetables need to be cooked at a high temperature to achieve the perfect tenderness and caramelization. If the temperature is too low, the vegetables will overcook before they reach the desired browning.
, Wash the vegetables well in cold, running water. Trim the vegetables, peeling or removing stalks where necessary. Cut the vegetables into evenly sized pieces, so they will roast an even rate. As you cut them into pieces, collect in a large bowl.









The smaller you cut the vegetables, the faster the cooking time, and vice versa.
Remember that vegetables will shrink when roasted, so you may want to account for that when you're planning portion sizes.

, Cover a large roasting pan or baking pan with aluminum foil or line with a silicone mat. This will help to minimize clean-up after roasting.









It is preferable to use a baking pan with low sides so the heat from the oven can envelope the vegetables more easily.
Metal baking pans work best. If you put a cold glass or ceramic dish straight into a hot oven, it can shatter.
If you only have glass or ceramic pan, place it in the oven while it preheats so it warms up slowly.

, In a large bowl, toss the vegetables with about a tablespoon of olive oil (or more, to taste). Use your hands or a spatula to turn the vegetables several times, to ensure they are evenly coated in oil. Season with salt and pepper and toss again.









At this point, you can add in whatever additional flavorings you choose, to complement your vegetables. Try adding a few cloves of garlic with the heads trimmed off, a tablespoon of lemon juice, or several sprigs of fresh herbs, such as rosemary, thyme, oregano, or sage.
You can also experiment by varying the oil you use. Olive oil is the standard, but you can also try using toasted sesame oil, peanut oil or safflower oil.
Some cooks take a shortcut by drizzling the oil directly onto vegetables on the baking sheet. This will work, but you will use a lot more oil this way, most of which will be wasted. The oil may also burn onto the baking sheet, giving a bitter, burnt taste to the vegetables.

, Space out the oiled vegetables evenly on the baking sheet, so the oven's heat can weave its way between. If the vegetables are crowded too close together, they will steam rather than roast.









If you are roasting several different vegetables, separate them according to cooking time. Vegetables like carrots and parsnips can take up to 45 minutes to roast, whereas softer vegetables like zucchini, eggplant, and asparagus may only take 10 to 15 minutes.

, Place the baking sheet with the vegetables into your preheated oven, on the middle or top rack. Roast for 15 minutes to an hour, depending on the vegetable. The vegetables are done when they are cooked through, the centers soft and creamy and the outer edges golden and crispy.









About halfway through the roasting time, you should check your vegetables and give them a quick toss. This will ensure that they brown evenly.

, Serve your roasted vegetables immediately. They make an amazing side dish for accompanying meat dishes. You can also save the leftovers for adding to salads or tossing into soups.

Heat liquids and saucy foods in a saucepan.,
Pan fry rice and noodles.,
Reheat grains with extra water.,
Crisp up pizza slices in a skillet.,
Warm up meat and stir fries in a pan.",How to Reheat Frozen or Chilled Food1," Transfer the food to a saucepan and add ¼ cup (59 ml) of water to prevent the food from scorching. Turn the heat to medium and put on a lid. Stir regularly as the food heats up.Depending on how much food you have, reheating could take about 20 minutes.


Ideal foods to reheat in this way include soups, stews, liquids, beverages, and chili.
For beverages, avoid adding additional water.;
, Add a tablespoon (15 ml) of cooking oil or butter to a skillet or cast iron pan. Heat the skillet over medium heat. When the oil is shimmering, add your food. Cook for about five minutes, and then use a spatula to flip the food. Cook for another five minutes, or until it’s heated through.


This method is ideal for noodles, pasta, rice, or other grains.You can also use this method with beans.
Frying in a bit of oil will make the noodles or rice slightly crispy.

, Another way to reheat rice and other grains is in a pot with some extra water. The water will add moisture back to the grains, and will bring the grains back to their original consistency. Pour the grains into a pot with ½ cup (118 ml) of water or broth. Heat the grains on medium until warmed through.As the grains cook, stir them every five minutes to ensure even heating.

, Turning on the oven for a slice of pizza is a waste of energy, and you can actually get a crispier crust by pan frying. Heat a dry cast iron pan or skillet over medium heat. Add the pizza and place a lid over the pan. Heat the pizza for three to four minutes, until it’s hot and the cheese is gooey., Add a tablespoon (15 ml) of oil or butter to a skillet, wok, or cast iron pan. Heat the oil over medium heat.

, Again, don’t use regular old plastic wrap, as it might melt onto your food. Don’t use tinfoil either, as it can spark and either start a fire or break your microwave.


You can purchase microwave covers that are made of microwave-safe plasticSimply cover it with a paper towel if you can’t find anything else

, How much chicken do you have? If it's a very small amount (a serving for a single meal), begin with one and a half minutes of reheating using the normal setting on your microwave — usually 1,000 watts. If you have a large amount of chicken, begin with 2 1/2 or 3 minutes of microwaving. In either case, check the temperature either by touching the chicken with your finger or by tasting a small bite to see if it's been warmed through properly. Continue to reheat thirty seconds at a time until it reaches an appropriate temperature.

, Keep in mind that the container will likely be very hot, so use oven mitts or potholders to safely remove the chicken from the microwave. Leave the cover over the chicken, and let it rest for two minutes before cutting into it or serving.

, Be careful when you do this, as it may release a large amount of hot steam. Keep your face and fingers out of the way to prevent burns.

Break out your slow cooker.,
Make an impromptu double-boiler.,
Turn a cooler into a heater.",How to Reheat Mashed Potatoes2," Grease the inside with butter. Pour enough cream or milk to line the bottom. Scoop your potatoes in, stir, and set the cooker to LOW. Serve your potatoes at any time up to 4 hours after doing so. Continue to stir at least once an hour in the meantime., Transfer your potatoes to a bowl. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean dish towel. Break out a pan large enough to fit the bowl. Fill the pan with a fair amount of water to boil (if the pan is deeper than the bowl, be careful not to fill it with too much water; you don’t want to submerge the bowl). Bring the water to a boil, then lower the heat to simmer. Place the bowl into the water. Stir your potatoes every 15 minutes until your meal is ready to serve. Add more boiling water to the pan if the original water begins to evaporate., If you don’t have a burner to spare on your oven, grab an ice cooler. Instead of ice, boil some water and fill the bottom.Cover your bowl of potatoes with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a dishcloth. Set your bowl inside the cooler and seal the lid. Stir your potatoes every 15 minutes until your meal is ready to serve. If the water inside the cooler cools off, drain the cooler and add more boiling water to keep your potatoes warm.


If your cooler is too small to fit your bowl of potatoes, scoop them into heavy-duty, sealable storage bags and set those inside your cooler."

Roasting carrots and parsnips.,
Roasting Brussels sprouts.,
Roasting eggplant and zucchini.,
Roasting sweet potatoes.,
Roasting broccoli and cauliflower.,
Finished.








",How to Roast Vegetables2," Carrots and parsnips are two similar vegetables that benefit hugely from roasting. Roasting brings out their abundant natural sugars, coating the vegetables and leading to a beautifully caramelized finish. Roasted carrots are sweet, while their paler cousins bring a wonderfully rich, flavor to the dish.










Chopping: A good technique for chopping carrots and parsnips is to cut a 1-inch chunk off the top end at a 45-degree angle, then roll the vegetable a quarter turn and repeat. This weird oblique shape gives you surface area for the natural sugars to work their magic. Half-inch coins or half-moons also work well. The centers of large parsnips can be woody, so you may need to remove them first.

Roasting time: At 450 °F (232 °C), carrots and parsnips will take between 30 and 40 minutes to roast, depending on the thickness of the vegetable. Again, make sure the pieces are a uniform size, so they will all cook at the same rate.

Flavor pairings: Carrots and parsnips are versatile when it comes to flavor pairings. You can highlight their inherent sweetness with a tablespoon or two of honey, or offset that sweetness with a glug of balsamic vinegar. Rosemary, thyme, and cumin are all popular accompanying herbs.

, These classic holiday vegetables often get a bad rap, but roasting your Brussels sprouts is guaranteed to turn even the most ardent sprout-hater into a fan. Tender on the inside, crispy on the outside, with a delectable nutty sweetness. Roast Brussels sprouts make the perfect healthy side dish, anytime of the year.










Chopping: Trim the stems and remove any wilted or yellowed outer leaves. Cut in half, lengthwise.

Roasting time: At 450 °F (232 °C), Brussels sprouts will take 30 to 40 minutes to roast. Place the sprouts cut side down on the baking pan, and then shake the pan about halfway through the roasting time.

Flavor pairings: Brussels sprouts work well with just olive oil salt and pepper. Balsamic vinegar adds a tangy finish. Or if you're feeling adventurous, try mixing some diced bacon or pancetta and toasted pine nuts in with your roasted sprouts.

, Roast eggplant and zucchini add a touch of Mediterranean flair to any meal. When roasted, these vegetables will be crisp and slightly charred around the edges and soft and squishy on the inside. Paired with some feta cheese, red onion and chickpeas, roasted eggplant and zucchini can make a tasty yet substantial vegetarian entrée.










Chopping: For the zucchini, remove the ends, and then cut lengthwise into long, thin slabs. For the eggplant, peel if desired, then cut into quarters, lengthwise. Cut into 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick slices.

Roasting time: Eggplant and zucchini will take 10-20 minutes to cook at 450 °F (232 °C), depending on the thickness of the slices.

Flavor pairings: An acidic flavor, such as balsamic vinegar or lemon juice, can work well to brighten up the flavor of toast eggplant and zucchini. Torn basil leaves, shredded fontina and parmesan, or crumbled feta can also add interest and flavor.

, Sweet potatoes are a seasonal favorite, and when roasted, make a good accompaniment to most fall dinners. They are naturally sweet (clue is in the name), and roasting only intensifies this sweetness. So step away from the marshmallows! Many people peel their sweet potatoes, but their skins can be left on for added crispy goodness!










Chopping: Sweet potatoes can be peeled, then cut into chunky wedges, thin strips, or 1-inch cubes. The smaller and thinner they are cut, the crispier they will be. If you choose to leave the skins on, remember to give them a good scrub before chopping.

Roasting time: In a 450 degree F oven, sweet potatoes will roast in approximately 30-45 minutes, again depending on thickness.

Flavor pairings: There are wide ranges of options when it comes to flavor pairings for sweet potatoes. They work well roasted with garlic, thyme, red pepper flakes, rosemary, cayenne pepper, or cinnamon. They can also be drizzled with balsamic vinegar, honey, lemon, or orange juice, or sweet chili sauce.

, Standard mealtime fare, broccoli and cauliflower, take on a new lease of life when simply roasted in a little olive oil and seasoned. When roasted, the tips of these vegetables become charred and beautifully crisp.










Chopping: Remove leaves and woody stem. Break into florets, about 1 - 1 1/2 inches in diameter.

Roasting time: Broccoli and cauliflower will take approximately 15-20 minutes to roast at 450 °F (232 °C). They should be tender and nicely browned.

Flavor pairings: Broccoli and cauliflower do well when roasted with garlic and lemon. They can also be drizzled in balsamic vinegar or sprinkled with Parmesan cheese. If you like your vegetables with a kick, try adding some chili flakes before roasting.

Preheat the oven.,
Prepare the food.,
Warm the food in short intervals.",How to Reheat Frozen or Chilled Food2," The oven or toaster oven is a great way to reheat a number of different foods, but it’s not ideal for everything. For smaller portions, use a toaster oven to conserve energy. Here are a few of the foods you can bake to reheat:Seafood
Bread and baked goods
Fried foods
Breaded foods
Roasted meat and vegetables
Grilled meat
Pizza (when you have more than a few slices)
Lasagna
Casseroles
Foods that were baked to begin with

, Thick foods like large pieces of meat, lasagna, and casseroles will take a long time to heat through in the oven. Shorten the heating time and ensure even heating by dividing them into individual portions before recooking them., You don’t need a high temperature to reheat food, because it’s already been cooked and you don’t want it to dry out. Set the oven to 350 F (177 C) or lower and let it preheat., Transfer the food to an oven-proof dish. To heat individual portions, separate them in the dish or use individual dishes for reheating. To keep the food from drying out, put on a lid, or use foil to cover the dish.Don’t cover foods that should be crispy, such as fried foods.

, Transfer the food to the oven. For smaller food and single-serving dishes, cook for five minutes and then check the temperature.For larger dishes or multiple portions, cook for 15 minutes and then check the temperature. Continue cooking in short intervals until the food is heated through.


Small or thin foods like pizza may only need five minutes
Baked goods, breads, and smaller cuts of meat will need around 15 minutes
Thicker foods like lasagna and casserole may need 30 minutes or more

Cook the food in short intervals until heated through.",How to Reheat Frozen or Chilled Food3," Certain foods don’t reheat well in the microwave, especially ones that are supposed to be crispy or have a crust. Foods that are good to reheat in the microwave are ones that have a lot of moisture, such as:Soups
Steamed vegetables
Boiled vegetables
Casseroles
Rice
Stews

, Larger items will take longer to cook, and if you try to reheat large and small items at the same time, the smaller items will be overcooked and the larger ones undercooked.


You can either cut larger items into smaller pieces, or precook them before recombining the dish.
For instance, if you're reheating a large piece of meat and some vegetables, cook the meat first, or cut the meat into smaller bites and cook it with the vegetables.

, Spread the food out in a single layer to ensure even cooking time. Make sure the dish is safe for the microwave, and doesn’t contain any metal.


Dishes that are microwave-safe include glass and ceramic ones., Food cooked in the microwave is at risk of drying out, so it’s important to cover the food. Some microwave dishes come with lids, but if you don’t have one, cover the dish with a damp towel or paper towel. This will help keep in moisture.For dishes with lids, only close the lid partially to allow steam to escape.

, For smaller servings, set the microwave to cook for one to two minutes. For larger servings, cook for three to four minutes. After that time, stir the food to distribute the heat, and then check the temperature. Cook for in additional one- to two-minute intervals until the food is hot. Stir in between each interval.


Microwaves tend to have hot and cold spots, which is why stirring is so important."

Bring a pan up to low-to-medium heat.,
Put a tablespoon of oil or butter in the pan.,
Reheat the chicken in the pan.,
Rest and serve.",How to Reheat Chicken2," A non-stick pan is ideal for reheating chicken — especially when the skin has been left on the meat, since the fatty skin tends to stick to heated pans.


You should be able to feel heat emanating off the pan when you place your hand two inches above it.
You don't want the pan to be as hot as you'd use to cook raw chicken, as intense heat will dry the chicken out.

, A little bit of fat in the pan will prevent the chicken from drying out.

, Place the cold chicken in the pan and watch it closely. To prevent burning, move the chicken around the pan so the surface doesn't have a chance to stick to the pan. Make sure to turn the pieces from time to time to heat the chicken through from both sides.

, Give the chicken a minute or two to redistribute its juices, then eat!

Place the liquid you want to reduce in a sauce pot or sauté pan, depending upon whatever the recipe calls for.,
Place the pot or pan over medium to high heat, and bring to a boil.

,
Boil, uncovered, until the amount of liquid in the pan has reduced according to the recipe you are following.,
Stir the liquid frequently while it boils to prevent it from sticking to the pan or scorching.,
Continue following the recipe as directed after the reduction is complete.

,
Store your reduction liquid in the freezer unless it is high in sugar.",How to Reduce in Cooking," The larger the surface of the pan, the easier the reduction will be because there is more room for the water molecules to move around. The overall reduction will not take as long with a pan with a large surface area.;
,, Many recipes call for you to reduce the liquid by half. You do not have to know exactly; just use your best guess.

, If you are using a pan with a heavy bottom, you may be able to add more heat without scalding the sauce. The thicker metal keeps the pan's contents from burning too quickly.

,, If it is high in sugar, it is best stored in an air-tight container in the refrigerator. If your reduction contains any meat drippings or products, it needs to be frozen and must be brought to a boil before using. Don't worry about thawing before bringing to a boil.

Sprinkle small amounts of baking soda gradually into food during cooking to reduce the acidity in the food.,
Cook dishes for the shortest time possible so that water isn't cooked away and acid isn't concentrated in a smaller volume of food.,
Prepare meat, fish or fowl separately from the sauce so the meat doesn't absorb acids from the sauce.,
Get protein in your diet by eating lean meats, London broil steak, skinless chicken, fish and egg whites as they are foods low in acid.

,
Incorporate high-alkaline foods into high-acid foods, as the alkalinity reduces the acidity.,
Reduce the phytic acid in legumes and beans by soaking the beans in hot water overnight before cooking.,
Reduce acid in a balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing by making the dressing with equal amounts of vinegar, oil and strong tea.

,
Cook with extra virgin olive oil or switch to a different type of oil, as olive oil is more acidic than other oils.,
Incorporate low acid fruits into your diet by eating sweet apples, mangoes, bananas and melons.

,
Increase your consumption of vegetables, as most vegetables can be prepared with little oil.

,
Eat low-fat foods to avoid acid, including skim milk, goat cheese and lower-fat or fat-free prepared foods.

,
Avoid onions, which are high in acid.

",How to Reduce Acidity in Cooking," Taste the food often, until the tart flavor of the food is reduced. Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate, which is a form of salt. If you are concerned about your sodium intake, add as little baking soda as possible until the food's tartness (and acid) is sufficiently reduced.;
, Simmering soups, casseroles, sauces and other dishes reduces water.

, If you are making spaghetti and meatballs, cook the sauce and meatballs separately, then add them together just before serving. This will prevent the meat from soaking up acid.

,, For example, to reduce acids in meat or fish casseroles, add peas, carrots or eggs, which are alkaline.

, In addition to reducing the acid, soaking beans in hot water makes your body better able to absorb the nutritious minerals in the beans.


Reduce the phytic acid content of grains by soaking them the same way you soak beans.

,, Canola oil is low in acid and healthful in other ways.

, You don’t have to bring the chicken up to room temperature if it's been frozen, but make sure it's not frozen solid. Place it in the refrigerator for several (6-8) hours before reheating it to slowly bring the temperature up.


If you are going to reheat the chicken immediately, place the frozen chicken in a water-proof Ziploc bag and run cold water over it until it thaws.
You can also thaw it in the microwave on the “Defrost” setting.

, A cookie sheet would be ideal. Check the bottom of the dish to make sure it will stand up to extreme temperatures.


Spread the precooked chicken pieces in the container, doing your best to keep even spacing between the pieces.
Cover your chicken pieces with leftover pan juices, if available.
Cover the dish or cookie pan with aluminum foil to keep the chicken from drying out.

, Set the oven to 425 to 475°F (220 to 245 degrees Celsius). Different ovens take different amounts of time to preheat, so make sure the oven is up to the right temperature before you insert the chicken for reheating.

, Once the oven has preheated, place the chicken in the oven. If the chicken has been cut into small pieces, it may take only a few minutes to reheat properly. If you are reheating large pieces, like whole breasts, you may have to wait longer.



Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature and make sure you’re not leaving the middle cold.
The chicken should be brought up to an internal temperature of 165°F before serving., Use oven mitts to protect your hands when removing the chicken from the oven, and use a potholder or trivet to protect your counters from the heat of the container.


If you have large pieces of chicken, let it rest for a couple minutes before cutting into it. This will allow the juices to redistribute, so you won’t have dry, tough chicken.

, Because the chicken has already been cooked, you don’t really need a roasting dish with deep sides, because there won’t be juices running off the chicken. However, a roasting dish is still a good size for reheating a rotisserie chicken.


Rub butter or oil on the surface of the dish, or spray it with nonstick cooking spray, to keep the chicken from sticking to it.
Place the whole rotisserie chicken in the dish.

, Place the dish in the properly preheated oven, making sure it’s in the center rack for even heat application. Depending on how large your chicken is, you might need a little more or less time, but it should take about 25 minutes for your chicken to reheat thoroughly.Use a meat thermometer to ensure the internal temperature reaches 165°F.
Begin checking the temperature a few minutes early, especially if your chicken is on the small side.
Don’t let the chicken overcook, as it gets tough and dry — especially the white meat.

, Remove the chicken from the oven, using oven mitts and trivets to protect your hands and the counter from the hot container. Let the chicken rest at room temperature for about five minutes before cutting into it. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the chicken, keeping it moist when served.

This is generally a good idea when working with any food. Your hands come into contact with thousands of bacteria over the course of the day. Lather up with some anti-bacterial soap. Wipe down your counter-tops and cooking tools, too.;
, Depending on the menu for your lobster dinner, you will want to buy enough lobster tails to feed those attending your party. An eight-ounce lobster tail is normally enough for a single adult.


Lobster tails can easily be purchased at most supermarkets, seafood markets and online.Be sure to check the tails' expiration date. Don’t purchase a lobster tail past the expiration date.
In general, cold-water lobster tails are better to work with than warm-water lobster tails. Industry experts find that warm-water tails tend to not cook as well, remaining mushy at their center rather than tender. Cold-water lobster tails are normally around $5 more than warm-water tails., As with any food preparation, you want to clean the tail thoroughly. Remove any grime from the outside of the lobster tail’s outer shell.

, Take a pair of kitchen scissors (properly cleaned) and cut from the center of one end of the tail to the other. Make sure that you cut only the outer exoskeleton of the lobster tail, not the meat inside.

, This part of the process can be messy, so have a rag on hand if you need to clean up any leaking liquids.


Be on the look out for gray, yellow or otherwise discolored meat. These colors can result from a variety of factors, such as improper freezing, general bruising or the lobster’s diet before it was brought to market. If you can remove the discolored region, the lobster tail should still be fine to eat., Use a pot that can hold three quarts of water to allow for the lobsters. Make sure that the water is thoroughly boiling., Simmer, uncovered for eight to 12 minutes. You know that it is nearly ready when the shell of the lobster turns bright red. The exposed meat will more tender as well. It may even start to separate from the lobster’s outer shell., Remove and let cool for 10 minutes. The lobster tail will be very hot after removing it from the boiling water. Let the lobster tail cool on a plate or a napkin for 10 minutes., Sometimes, the outer shell contracts after you remove the tail from the boiling water. Take your scissors and cut more shell off to make eating the tail easier., If you decide that you'd rather broil than boil your lobster, start by turning on your broiler and letting it warm up for about five to 10 minutes., Mix 1 tsp of salt, 1 tsp of pepper, 1/2 tsp of paprika and 1 tsp of lemon juice together and rub on the exposed lobster meat generously. While broiling, these seasonings will seep deep into the lobster and add excellent flavor., You can cover the baking sheet in tin foil, if you would like. The foil will reduce the need to clean the pan., Broil until the lobster meat becomes opaque and the outer tail turns a light shade of brown., Let your lobster tail cool for five to 10 minutes after you remove it from the oven., This will leave the tail meat exposed at the top and will be easier to eat.

, Many restaurants often completely cut the lobster tail in half and place the halves side by side. Restaurants often choose this presentation to make it seem like you are getting more lobster. It is called ""butterflying"" because the two halves roughly resemble the symmetry of a butterfly., You may need these tools to cut up the meat or to break open the lobster tail's outer shell. Some people like to eat lobster tail with their hands. In this case, obviously, no fork or knife is needed.

, Melt several sticks of butter into a saucepan. The clearer liquid that rises to the top is the clarified butter. Slowly drain off the clarified butter into a small bowl that your guests can use to dip lobster pieces in.You can also buy pre-clarified butter at the store, which will last roughly a month in your refrigerator.

, Lobster is a light meat, so you should choose a wine that does not have a powerful flavor. The robust flavor and tannins in red wine won’t pair well with the iodine and saltiness of the lobster. , Many consider surf-and-turf (lobster-and-steak) to be a perfect pairing.

Let the mixture sit.,
Throw them into salads.,
Replace pickles on burgers and brats.,
Put them onto crackers or cheese plates.",How to Pickle Radishes," Every kind of radish can be pickled, however, some of them have different tastes based on variety and season. For example, if you are choosing a radish in the winter or spring, they are likely to have a sweeter taste. On the other hand, in the dry summer months, many radishes can be bitter and peppery. While Cherry Belle radishes are the most common, you can also choose a milder radish like the French Breakfast radish, which has an extra crunch. Or, you may prefer a juicier radish like the Early Scarlet Gold. It’s up to you!Radishes can keep up to five days after purchasing.;
, Before you start the fermentation process, it’s important to properly clean your radishes. Remove any leaves or stems, and trim off the root ends. Then wash and scrub each radish with cold water. You can also cut out any soft portions where the radish is bruised. However, make sure to keep the skin intact., Using a paring knife or the slicing blade of a food processor, cut your radishes into thin slices. These should be about 1/4th inch rounds and yield two cups. Once you’ve cut your radishes, take your small onion and cut it into thin wedges. Then separate the pieces with your fingers.Place both these items into a small bowl and set them aside.

, Take a ½ cup of vinegar, a ½ cup of sugar, and 1 ½ teaspoon of salt and mix them together in a small bowl. Then take a whisk or spoon and stir the mixture until the sugar has completely dissolved. This should take one to two minutes. Once the sugar has dissolved, set this bowl aside along with the radishes and onion.

, Take a glass jar, like an old jam/jelly pot or Mason jar, and place the sliced radishes and onion wedges into the bottom of it. Once everything is inside, take the vinegar, sugar, and salt mixture and pour it over the radishes. Make sure that there is a little bit of space between the liquid marinade and the lip of the jar. Also, when putting the lid on, make sure not to secure it tightly as you want to leave room for carbonation to escape.You can also add 6 heads of fresh dill weed or a tablespoon of pink/black peppercorn for extra flavor.
You may have to place a weight or other item into the jar to keep the radishes submerged. For example, you can take a smaller jar full of water and put it into the jar to weigh the radishes down.

, After you’ve put everything together, you need to let the radishes ferment. Allow the jar to sit at room temperature for anywhere between six days to two weeks. While the radishes ferment, they may lose their vibrant color. However, the flavor should deepen and they should remain crunchy.Keep in mind that fermented radishes have a pungent odor that may increase the longer they are jarred.

, Try adding pickled radishes to your everyday salad for an extra crunch and kick of flavor. You can use them as a replacement for cucumbers, or simply put them in as an addition. For example, you can create a healthy, Asian-inspired salad using only pickled radishes, cucumbers, and spring onions. Simply toss together a little bit of rice vinegar and toasted sesame oil as dressing., Try trading out pickles for pickled radishes for a different flavor note in some of your classic favorites. For example, you can use your pickled radish for a Korean burger with red onion and Miso mayonnaise. Or you could change out the relish on your hot dogs or bratwurst with your homemade radishes instead.

, For an easy at-home snack or party dish, throw some pickled radish onto a cracker with cheese. Try placing them on a whole wheat cracker and add some cream cheese and chives. You can also try pairing them with goat cheese, blue cheese, or crème fraîche.

Be sure that it is wide enough for what you are cooking, as you will not want to overcrowd the pan., Unless you have a non-stick pan, you should heat the pan before you add the oil. This will prevent the meats from sticking to the pan. It will also heat the oil more quickly. It will only take two or three minutes for the pan to heat up.If you have a nonstick pan, add the oil to a cold pan and heat both up together.

, One or two tablespoons is enough. Tilt the pan to evenly spread the oil over the surface. The best oils to use are flavorless. These include light or refined olive oil, canola oil, and peanut oil.Avoid using extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) if possible.


EVOO can burn in the pan when frying because of its lower smoke point. EVOO starts to smoke at 325-375F compared to 465F for light or refined olive oil.Since food starts to fry around 365-375F, your extra-virgin olive oil may begin to burn before it starts to fry, giving your food a bitter taste.If you have no other option, watch the oil carefully. If it starts to smoke, remove from the heat and let it cool before dumping it and trying again.

, If you added the oil to a hot pan, it should heat up quickly—within a minute of adding it. If you added oil to a cold pan, it may take a few minutes for it to heat up. There are a few tests you can do to see if it is hot enough.


Use a cooking thermometer to know the exact heat. Stick the metal end into the oil, and wait 5 seconds for an accurate reading. The oil should be hot enough around 365 degrees F.
Stick the handle of a wooden spoon in it. Bubbles will rise and pop when it is hot.If you don’t have a wooden spoon, try a drop of water instead (and no more than a drop). The water will begin to sizzle and pop when the oil is hot enough. This may cause the oil to splatter so be careful.
Do not leave your pan unattended while heating it at the stove. It only takes a few minutes for it to heat up, and you do not want to burn the oil or start a fire.

, Make sure that every piece has plenty of room. No two pieces of meat should be touching. Leave a small space between each. If you are cooking vegetables, make sure that there is a single layer of veggies; they should not be piled on one another. Food releases steam as it is fried. If you overcrowd the pan, the steam will not release, and you may end up with a soggy meal.Understand that whatever side goes down first will look the best so if you are aiming for a nice presentation, put your chicken breasts down on the rounded side and your fish flesh side down instead of skin side., If possible, use tongs instead of a fork. A fork can puncture the meat and lose its juices. Different meats take different lengths of time. You will have to time yours based on the size of each cut and the type of meat. Flipping the meat too often or too soon can ruin the batter.


Flip chicken and steak after 4-6 minutes.Flip fish and pork after 3-4 minutes., You may want to use a thermometer to make sure that the meat is fully cooked through. Stick the thermometer in the thickest part of the meat. Otherwise, you can cut open the meat to see if it is done or not. Different types of meats require different temperatures for safe eating.


Beef steaks need an internal temperature of 145 degrees F. The inside can be pink, but not red.
Chicken and turkey need internal temperatures of 165 degrees F. The inside should be white, not pink. Juices should run clear.
Pork should have an internal temperature of 145 degrees F. The inside should be mostly cooked white or brown, although there may be a slight pink tint.
Fish should have an internal temperature of 145 degrees F. The flesh should flake away easily with a fork., Use tongs if possible. A spatula is a good back up. Place the food on a plate. If you are frying meats such as pork or beef, you may want to let the meat rest for three minutes to keep its juices intact and to let it finish cooking.Serve immediately.

Add an inch of cooking oil to a skillet.,
Batter the food before frying.,
Add your food to the hot oil.,
Flip halfway through.,
Transfer to a paper towel.",How to Pan Fry2," The oil should come halfway up the sides of the pan. Canola, vegetable, sunflower, and light olive oil work well for this type of frying., Have the battered food ready for when the oil is hot. You can check if the oil is hot enough by sticking a wooden spoon into the oil. The oil will bubble around the spoon when it is ready.

, Make sure that every piece has plenty of room. You do not want to crowd the food, or it will not fry properly. The food should sizzle as it touches the oil.If it does not, the oil is not hot enough. Wait to add the other pieces.

, Use tongs if possible. Forks can be used to flip, but they are not ideal. You only want to flip once to ensure that the batter cooks correctly. Flipping too often or too soon can cause the batter to fall off., Once you have removed your food, place them on a paper towel. You can use tongs or a slotted spatula. The paper towel will soak up excess oil, giving you a crispier batter.The meats should rest for a moment to finish cooking. Serve immediately.

Choose a wok.,
Cut up your meats and vegetables.,
Heat up one to two tablespoons of oil.,
Add your ingredients.,
Toss ingredients in the wok.,
Pour sauce into the pan.,
Scoop out of the pan to serve.,
Finished.

",How to Pan Fry3," A wok is large pan with sloped sides. Woks are ideal for this type of frying because you can cook in stages. While you can use a skillet for stir-frying, the results will not be as consistent or as tasty., Stir-frying is similar to sautéing in that it requires you to cut up your foods before you cook them. Make sure that all pieces are roughly the same size and weight. This will ensure uniform cooking. Have them all chopped and ready before you heat the pan. , Set the stove to high heat. Stir-frying requires higher heat than other types of pan frying. Peanut oil is best for stir-frying, although you can use canola or vegetable oil.

, Sear the meat first by adding it to the pan and flipping it after a minute until both sides are browned. Then add your vegetables. Some vegetables-- such as broccoli, baby corn, and carrots-- take longer than others and should be added first. Add in soft vegetables like bok choy or mushrooms at the end., Use a wooden spoon to mix, flip, and stir the ingredients. You want to make sure that everything cooks evenly. If something looks like it is over-cooking, push it up against the cooler sides of the wok so that it does not burn.

, Let the sauce steam and cook into the vegetables. Stir well to make sure that everything is coated. There are many types of popular sauce that you can either make or buy, such as:


Soy sauce
Soy ginger sauce
Orange sauce
Hoisin sauce
Black bean sauce

, You can serve it on rice, noodles, or on its own. Eat it while it is hot, or cool and save for later. Stir-fry keeps well if stored in the refrigerator. You can reheat it later in the microwave or eat it cold.

Get only as much garlic as you need.,
Choose the best, freshest garlic.,
Store your garlic correctly.,
Peel your garlic only when you're going to use it.",How to Preserve Fresh Garlic1," Garlic is a very strong flavor, so a little bit goes a long way. It's easy to overestimate how much you'll need, so be careful not to get too much.;
, You want a very nice white shelled bulb, free of any black spots. Make sure the garlic you get all has its own distinctive shell.

, This is key to keeping garlic fresh. Keep it in a dark, cool, dry place, maybe in a container or a glass. It's okay to leave it sitting out on a counter, but try to keep it away from heat, moisture, and too much sunlight.

, Garlic can go bad very quickly once you peel it, so make sure to do so only just before you use it.

Toss the shaved asparagus with the dressing.,
Shave some more parmesan over the asparagus before serving.,
Add the shaved asparagus to a salad.,
Top pizza or focaccia with shaved asparagus.,
Mix the shaved asparagus into pasta.,
Combine the shaved asparagus with eggs.",How to Prepare Shaved Asparagus," You can shave as many asparagus spears as you’d like, but 10 to 12 spears typically makes 4 servings. Place the spears flat on a cutting board, and use a sharp knife to remove the woody tips. Discard the ends.Make sure the asparagus is clean by rinsing the spears under cool water at the sink to remove any dirt. Dry them by rolling them between two kitchen towels.;
, To shave the asparagus, take 1 spear at a time and use a vegetable peeler to create long, thin shavings. Gather the shavings in a medium bowl, and continue working until you’ve shaved all of the spears.A swivel-blade vegetable peeler works best for shaving the asparagus.
If the asparagus slips or moves while you peel it, shave one side completely to create a flat surface and place it with the flat side down to steady it.

, In many cases, you’ll be able to shave the entire spear with the vegetable peeler. However, if you find that the final layer of the stalk is too hard to peel, use a sharp knife to cut it into thin strips.Don’t worry if the strips you cut aren’t as thin as the shavings. They’ll blend in just fine.

, Add ¼ cup (25 g) of finely grated parmesan cheese and 1 ½ tablespoons (22 ½ ml) of fresh lemon juice to a small bowl. Stir the two together until they’re completely blended.You can substitute grated pecorino romano, grana padano, or asiago cheese for the parmesan if you prefer.

, When the grated cheese and lemon juice are combined, gradually pour ¼ cup (59 ml) of extra virgin olive oil. Slowly whisk the oil into the cheese mixture until it’s fully blended in. Next, add some kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to season it. Be sure to taste the dressing as you add the salt and pepper, so you don’t overseason it.

, Once the dressing is fully mixed and seasoned, add the shaved asparagus to the bowl. Carefully toss the shavings with the vinaigrette until they are fully coated., When the shavings are coated with the dressing, divide them between four plates. Use the vegetable peeler to shave a little more of the parmesan cheese over the shaved asparagus and serve as a first course.If you like, you can spoon some of the vinaigrette that’s left in the bowl after you plate the asparagus over the shavings for more flavor.

, While the asparagus shavings make a delicious salad on their own, you can also mix them into whatever salad you like. They pair especially well with avocado and mint for a tasty summer salad.Shaved asparagus also mixes well with grain salads, such as barley, quinoa, farro, or tabbouleh.

, Shaved asparagus makes a tasty, unique topping for pizza. Add it to the dough on top of the sauce and then cover with cheese before baking it in the oven. You can also use the shaved asparagus to replace lettuce or other greens on a focaccia.Shaved asparagus is also makes a tasty replacement for lettuce or other greens on a sandwich.
You can also use asparagus as a topping for simple toast. Spread a little ricotta or mashed avocado on the toasted bread, and add a few curls of asparagus to finish it off.

, Because shaved asparagus has a similar shape and size to fettucine, it’s an ideal mix-in for pasta dishes. Mix it into a simple fettuccine alfredo or carbonara to give it some delicious spring flavor.Asparagus shavings don’t just work with cream pasta sauces. Mix it into your favorite tomato-based pasta, garlic and oil recipe, or other pasta dishes.

, If you want to dress up your usual breakfast of scrambled eggs or an omelet, add some shaved asparagus to the eggs. It pairs especially well with goat cheese and grated Fontina, so you can have creamy, delicious eggs with the earthy flavor of the asparagus.Adding asparagus ribbons to scrambled eggs or omelets is an especially tasty option if you’re preparing them for brunch or dinner.

Chop and store fruits and vegetables for the week.,
Combine seasonings ahead of time.,
Prepare meat in bulk.,
Cook lots of pasta in the morning.,
Parboil vegetables in the morning.,
Learn to love roasted veggies.",How to Reduce Prep Time when Cooking1," To save time on busy weeknights, designate a block of time Sunday night to chop, slice, and dice fruits and veggies for the rest of the week’s meals.You can place chopped fruits or veggies in a plastic bag or storage container with a damp paper towel and store them in the fridge.
Place chopped onions and other go-to ingredients in a freezer bag and freeze them for up to three weeks.
Store potatoes, apples, and other items that turn brown in the fridge in a bowl of ice water with a squeeze of lemon juice.;
, Try to plan your meals for the week ahead and think of which spices you’ll need for them. Premeasure them in the morning or over the weekend and store them in small storage containers or plastic bags.Pre-measured seasonings will save you time when you actually cook your meal, ensure you use the right amount, and guarantee you won’t forget a spice.

, Instead of cooking meat for just one meal, prepare a larger quantity that you can either freeze or refrigerate for a quick meal later in the week. Reuse your leftovers creatively so you won’t get bored eating the same thing.For example, shred your roasted chicken leftovers to make quesadillas or chicken salad., Try boiling a large pot of pasta in the morning while you pack lunches, make coffee, eat breakfast, and complete other tasks. Boil it until it’s al dente, drain the water, then cover it and refrigerate it until dinner.Multitasking in the morning will save you a solid 15 minutes at dinnertime. Set a timer if you’re worried that you might forget about the boiling pasta.

, Boil your veggies until they’re not quite tender, transfer them to a bowl of ice water, drain them, then refrigerate them until dinnertime. This will cut prep time at dinner hour and, since you’ll only have to warm the veggies, reduce overall cooking time.For example, parboil veggies like broccoli, carrots, and asparagus in the morning, then add them to a stir-fry, a pasta dish, or just serve them as side dishes.
Shocking them in ice water will also preserve their color and up your presentation game.

, Compared to stir-frying or sauteing, roasting is a relatively hands-off cooking method that requires minimal prep. Instead of spending lots of time finely mincing, slicing, or dicing, you’ll only need to give your veggies a rough chop. Simply drizzle them with olive oil and seasonings, then pop them in the oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) for 30 to 45 minutes.Aside from turning them once while they roast, you’ll be free to get ready in the morning or finish up that bit of paperwork you took home from the office.

Freeze garlic.,
Dry your garlic.,
Pickle garlic.,
Make simple refrigerator pickles out of your garlic.",How to Preserve Fresh Garlic2," This is the easiest way to preserve garlic for later use. Simply peel the garlic cloves, put them in a plastic bag, and stick them in your freezer.


Chop garlic before freezing to make it easier to throw into a dish quickly.
Freezing chopped garlic in oil prevents it from freezing solid, which will allow you to scoop only appropriate amounts out when you're ready to use it.
Using Olive oil can make your garlic last longer than any other oil.

, Use a food dehydrator, or bake at a low temperature on drying racks in your oven.

, This slightly alters the flavor, but it drastically increases the shelf life.

, This is an easier way of pickling your garlic, and it will keep almost indefinitely. Simply submerge peeled cloves of garlic in red or white wine vinegar and add a tablespoon of salt for each cup of vinegar you used. If you want, add dried herbs like red pepper flakes or oregano to flavor. The garlic will keep as long as it remains submerged in the vinegar.

Use a sharp chef’s knife.,
Put your metal egg slicer to good use.,
Get a good peeler.,
Stock up on multiple flexible plastic cutting boards.,
Invest in a food processor, blender, and mandoline.",How to Reduce Prep Time when Cooking2," A sharp, good quality knife is the biggest kitchen time saver. Invest in a well-balanced chef’s knife and knife sharpener. Work on your knife skills to prep food more efficiently, and remember to curl your guiding hand’s fingers inward to avoid cutting yourself.For some cutting tasks, like trimming and deboning, it’s quicker and easier to use a good set of kitchen shears instead of a knife. Choose a sturdy pair that can come apart for easy cleaning.

, That egg slicer collecting dust in your cupboard is much more versatile than its name implies. You can use it to slice ingredients like mushrooms, strawberries, and kiwis.When shopping for an egg slicer, choose an all-metal model. The better the quality, the better it’ll handle items other than hard-boiled eggs.

, Peeling is one of the most time consuming and tedious prep jobs, so a sharp, durable vegetable peeler is a key time-saving kitchen tool. Using a high-quality peeler instead a dull one or paring knife will allow you to quickly and evenly prep carrots, apples, and other fruits and veggies.Using tricks of the trade can also help you reduce your peeling time. To peel a head of garlic, smash it with the heel of your hand to loosen the cloves, then shake the cloves between two bowls.If you microwave a head of garlic for 20 seconds, the cloves will slip right out of the skin.To peel potatoes easily, score them (just slicing the skin) around the middle, boil them for 15 minutes, drain the water, rinse them with cold water so they’re cool enough to touch, then gently peel off the skins., After chopping your veggies, you can curl a flexible cutting board to quickly and easily pour them into a storage container or hot pot. Since they’re dishwasher safe, they’ll also reduce your clean up time.Use multiple cutting boards to avoid cross-contamination and cut out the time it would take to wash one board between uses.

, Food processors and mini-choppers can mince, slice, and dice large quantities of food much faster than a knife or grater.In addition to reducing prep time, blenders and immersion blenders are essential for tasks like pureeing.Try making a quick soup or sauce by pureeing leftover veggies, like spinach and other leafy greens.
You can also slash your cutting time by using a mandoline to uniformly shave, slice, or julienne ingredients."

Take a minute to strategize before you start cooking.,
Delegate tasks to family members.,
Use a countertop garbage bowl.",How to Reduce Prep Time when Cooking3," Before diving in to whip up dinner, take a moment to visualize each task. Check your recipe or estimate how long everything will take to preheat, prep, and cook so you can figure out how to multitask your meal.Form a quick strategy and map everything out. Can you slice the onions while the oven preheats, saucepan gets hot, and butter melts? Maybe you can season the salmon and pop it in the oven while you caramelize the onions for a quick sauce. Then, five minutes before the salmon’s done, warm the potatoes and carrots you roasted this morning. Just before taking the fish out of the oven, deglaze the onions with some white wine and add herbs to finish the sauce.  

, If you have kids, cut down on your prep work by having them perform age-appropriate tasks, like washing or chopping veggies or whisking up a dressing. In addition to organizing and dividing the labor, you’ll spend quality time together.You could also invite a friend over to cook together. Prep and cooking will go faster, and you can socialize without spending the money you would at a restaurant., Peels, stems, eggshells, trimmings, wrappers, and other odds and ends inevitably pile up when prepping and cooking meals. Instead of running back and forth to the trash can, keep a large bowl or container by your prep area so you can quickly toss away scraps.Since you won’t be running across your kitchen with handfuls of food scraps, you’ll probably keep your floor cleaner, too.

Make a resolution to take a new attitude toward food and eating.,
Purchase only high quality food that is not overly processed.,
Make eating and dining a family affair.",How to Practice Culinary Mindfulness," Looking for immediate gratification through eating processed foods is an easy habit to fall into. The desire to move away from a “quick fix” dining experience into a more transcendent, evolved relationship with food is the first step toward becoming more culinary mindful.


Evaluate how you physically feel. If you feel sluggish or are dealing with weight issues, you may have been a slave to a diet rich processed foods that may be chock full of sugar, sodium and fat. If you are tired of feeling tired or not well, make a commitment to revise your diet, knowing that a nutrition plan derived from nature will heal your body, providing you with more energy and zest for living.
Consider if you’ve developed health issues. Some health problems are linked directly to having a poor diet. According to a 2006 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 32% of Americans are considered to be obese with the majority of those individuals becoming diabetic as a result of consuming an “American-based” diet (a diet filled with processed, high fat foods).
Determine how your eating patterns impact your family. With a growing number of Americans becoming overweight and obese, do you want to pass this cycle of eating onto your children or are you ready to break out and start something new?;
, This means to choose fresh produce, meat and the like. Some people may want to select organic produce or hormone-free meat.


Grow your own. Even a small patio in a condo building can be the basis for a small garden. Choose your favorite vegetables and plant seeds in pots.
Participate in a farm share. Whether you live in the suburbs or in an urban environment, nearly everyone has access to a farm share cooperative where you can obtain fresh, pesticide free produce for less than what you would pay at the market.
Invite your children to assist with meal preparation. Even the youngest children can help with washing the vegetables or even tossing a salad. Giving them a job teaches them about the importance of not only eating well, but also being together and having fun.
Set aside at least one meal per week where everyone gets involved. In some cases, slowing down to make a meal can create stress for some families because they are running at such as fast pace--grabbing fast food is the easiest way to provide nourishment. However, part of trying to enjoy life and eating well should be a priority so, while you may need to make it to a 6:30 soccer game, try to set aside one evening when no one has an activity to play together in the kitchen.
Ask family members to try new recipes. In order for everyone to feel involved, everyone needs to make recommendations regarding “what’s for dinner” ( or lunch or breakfast). Assist children with preparation and try new flavors and foods--you may stumble across a recipe or new food you never knew you loved.

, If your family is one who eats in the car or mindlessly consumes food while answering emails or texting, it’s time to put down the phone, park and go inside the house for an old fashioned family meal.


Invite everyone to eat at the dining room or kitchen table. Enjoying food together is part of culinary mindfulness. Sharing stories and laughter around the family harvest table not only allows you to eat dinner but strengthen your family bond.
Shop together. Shopping for the food is a huge part of being culinary mindful. Discuss the food you see at the market and share ideas on how you could prepare an eggplant, for example.
Set a pretty table. Make the entire experience more inviting by taking the time and care to set the table with more than just a fork and a plate. Consider getting out the tablecloth and even grandma’s fine China (when else but the holidays do you use it?). Making every meal special and important will help to inspire conversation and the desire to eat well.

Cook for 8 to 10 more minutes without stirring.,
Check the temperature of the sugar with a kitchen thermometer.,
Make flan.,
Make caramel.,
Make spun sugar.,
Make caramel candy.",How to Melt Sugar," Determine how much sugar you want to melt. Since sugar is so tricky to melt evenly without letting it burn, you shouldn't attempt to melt more than 2 cups at a time.If you need more for your recipe, melt a second batch separately.









Use white granular sugar, also known as table sugar.
A good rule of thumb when melting sugar is that 2 cups of sugar will make enough melted sugar to make 1 cup of caramel.;
, A heavy-bottomed pot insures an even distribution of heat. A medium-sized saucepan is usually perfect to use for melting sugar. An aluminum or steel pot will work best.









Use half as much cold water by weight as the amount of sugar you are using.
Make sure the pot is completely clean. If sediment is left in the pot, sugar crystals could form around it.

, Using low heat means the sugar will take awhile to melt, but don't be tempted to turn it up; sugar will quickly burn when cooked over higher heat. Using low heat gives you better control.








, Stirring at the beginning of the process helps break up lumps and make sure that the sugar is heated evenly. It's best to use a wooden spoon. Keep stirring until the sugar mixture turns clear and begins to simmer.









Use a pastry brush to wash any sugar off the edge of the pan back down in with the rest of the sugar.
If crystals form on the edge of the pan, they can seed crystal formation in the entire mixture and the sugar will seize. Brushing the sides of the pot very carefully with warm water can prevent this.

, Once the sugar has melted and starts to simmer, let it cook until it caramelizes. Stirring at this point could cause crystal formation, so don't stir any more from this point on.








, If you want the sugar to stay in its liquid form, it is ready when it reaches 340 to 350 °F (171 to 177 °C). At this point the color will be a rich golden brown.









Different temperatures are desirable for different applications. When your sugar reaches the desired temperature for your particular recipe, it is done.

, This classic Mexican dessert is made by pouring the melted, caramelized sugar into a pan, then topping it with a creamy egg mixture and baking until set. The pan is turned over onto a plate so that the warm brown caramel tops the dessert.








, To make a creamy caramel sauce, cream and butter are added to the sugar after it has melted. This mixture is then used as a delicious topping for ice cream, chocolate cake and other decadent treats.








, Spun sugar is made by cooking melted sugar until it reaches the hard ball stage, meaning it will harden once it cools to room temperature. It can be used to make amazing designs to decorate all types of desserts.








, This buttery, flavorful candy is made by adding cream and butter to the melted sugar, then cooking the mixture until it reaches the hard ball stage. At this point, the caramel is poured into molds and left to harden at room temperature.

Locate your broiler.,
Prepare your broiler pan.,
Position your oven rack.,
Warm up your broiler.,
Use the ""high"" setting.",How to Oven Broil1," There are two options for where your broiler might be. In some gas ovens, there will be a drawer below your oven with your broiler inside. In most electric ovens and some gas ovens, there will be a broiling rod at the top of the oven. Take a peek inside your oven and determine the location of your broiler., If your broiler sits inside of a drawer at the bottom of your oven, it may contain a two-tiered broiling pan. If your broiler is in the top of your oven--or if you've misplaced your two-tiered broiling pan--you will need to use something else. A rimmed cookie sheet is a good option. Cover the pan you will use with aluminum foil, and give it a light spritz with non-stick cooking spray.If you have a two-tiered broiling pan, cover both tiers with foil. Cut slits into foil on the top pan to allow any fat or grease to drain.
Do not use glassware. Even reinforced glass--such as Pyrex--can be damaged under such high heat.

, If your broiler sits inside your oven, you will need to make sure that you have a rack in the best position. In general, you will place an oven rack in the highest possible slot, 2-4 inches (5.08 - 10.16 cm) away from the heat source. However, for some recipes (such as broiling certain vegetables or fruit), you may want the rack a bit farther away., Your broiler is a direct heat source that warms up pretty quickly. Turn on your broiler and allow it to heat up for five minutes before you begin cooking your food., Most broilers will have just an ""on"" or ""off"" option. But some may also have ""high"" or ""low"" settings. In general, keep your broiler set to high and ignore the low setting. If you are using the low setting, you are really just roasting your food, not broiling."

Put the rice on a plate.,
Dampen a paper towel.,
Place the towel over the rice.,
Microwave the rice on low.,
Let the rice stand.",How to Microwave Refrigerated Rice1," Unless you have a specific need to use a bowl, a plate allows the rice more surface area on which to be heated. It will allow the moisture added to reach more of the rice. Use a fork to break up any clumps of rice. If you must use a bowl, try and have it be as shallow as possible., Take a paper towel and soak it in lukewarm water. Make sure to use a large enough paper towel to cover the area of the plate you're using. Once damp, carefully ring out the towel (avoid tearing) enough so that it's still damp, but not dripping water.

, Lay the damp paper towel flat over the top of the rice. Pat down the paper towel so that it makes contact with the topmost layer of rice. Press it into the rice along the edges of the plate, and fold the towel's edges over the bottom of the plate. Try and make the best seal you can as you're essentially creating a steam chamber for the rice.

, If you have the time it's best to microwave your rice on a lower power setting to avoid drying out the rice. A longer microwave time will allow the moisture more time to enter the refrigerated rice. Though all microwaves differ, an ideal time and power level would be 4 minutes using 50% or 60% power. At the very least try 2 minutes on 80 percent power.

, Again, provided you're not in a hurry it's best to let the rice stay covered in the microwave for a minute or so. This both helps to cool down the rice and allow more time for the moisture to reach the rice. Once done, remove the paper towel and enjoy your rice."

Use a meat thermometer.",How to Oven Broil2," If your recipe calls for oil and/or spices, place these on your meat now. Be sure to season both sides of the meat. Using oils or herbs and spices is totally optional when using your broiler., Once your meat has been brought to room temperature and seasoned, it is ready to go in the oven. Set the meat on the broiler pan of your choice, and place the pan in the oven directly beneath the broiler.If your broiler is in a drawer, slide the drawer out and place your broiler pan inside.
If your broiler is in the top of your oven, place your pan on an oven rack in the highest position.

, For thin to medium-sized cuts of meat, you will want to wait 7-10 minutes before flipping the meat. If you are using thicker cuts (or if you prefer your meat very well done) wait closer to 15 minutes, then flip., After your meat has been flipped, place it back under the broiler and close the door. Wait an additional 5-10 minutes for the meat to finish cooking., The safest and most accurate way to determine the doneness of your meat is to check the internal temperature with a meat thermometer. When your meat reaches the appropriate temperature, remove it from the broiler.Here are some guidelines:


Medium rare meat = 145 degrees F (63 C)
Medium = 160 degrees F (71 C)

You may want to set a timer for 10 minutes.If you have a drawer-style broiler, slide it out and place your pan inside.
If your have a broiler at the top of your oven, set an oven rack at the highest position and place your pan it.

, When your timer goes off, you will know that it is time to turn your vegetables. Carefully remove the broiling pan, turn the vegetables over, and return them to the oven., After you return the pan to the oven, you will want to keep a close watch on your vegetables to make sure that they do not burn. Allow them to broil for up to five more minutes, or when they are cooked through."

Fill a microwave-safe cup.,
Microwave the cup for one minute.,
Microwave the rice and water on lower power levels.,
Let the rice stand for a minute.",How to Microwave Refrigerated Rice2," Using any micro-wave safe cup, fill about 2/3 of it with warm water. If you have no paper towels on hand, including a cup of water in the microwave along with the rice is an alternative way of adding moisture into the microwaving process. As the water heats, it releases steam at least some of which will return to your rice as added moisture (much how rice is cooked in the first place).

, Before adding the rice, heat the water in the microwave for a minute (or until you see it boil) to prime it for use with the rice. Keep a napkin or cloth towel nearby, as water may spill over the edge. If this is too much of a problem, pour some water out of the cup.

, Using power levels as suggest above, put your rice into the microwave with the heated water. Remember to keep them separate; have them on opposite sides of the rotating microwave dish. For this method it's advisable to use a little higher power and less time (2 minutes on 80% power is ideal) so the water never cools too much. The water in the cup ought to stay steaming in order to return moisture to the rice., Check the rice with your finger (carefully) to gauge how moist it has become. It may require more time if still dry to the touch. Once complete, dispose of the water carefully as it may still be near-boiling.

Place your dish on the scale.Most substances you'll need to measure will need to be poured into a bowl or other container as you measure them.,
Zero it out.,
Slowly add the substance being measured.,
Zero out the scale again before adding a second substance.",How to Measure Ounces1," Place this dish on your scale while it is still empty.


The ""ounce"" refers to a unit of measurement related to weight or mass. Do not confuse this with ""fluid ounce,"" which refers to a unit of measurement related to volume.
Ounces are part of the American Standard measurement system and not part of the Metric system. Their equivalent within the Metric system is the gram.
Make sure that you have a scale that can measure in American Standard.;
, With the dish on your scale, ""tare"" or ""zero out"" the weight. Doing so resets the scale so that its current conditions are considered the new ""zero"" mark, and as a result, the weight of your container will not interfere with your measurement. This process will vary depending on the scale type and model you use.

For most digital scales, you will only need to hit the ""On/Clear"" button again to zero out the scale. Some scales may have a separate button labeled ""Tare"" or ""Zero,"" though.






If using a mechanical scale, you will need to manually turn the knob back to the zero mark to reset it.






For balance scales, simply set the pointer to the center mark.







, Add your ingredient or substance to the dish on your scale. Carefully monitor the reading your scale gives you as you add the substance to avoid adding too much to the dish.


If you add too much, simply take some of the substance out of the dish.
If you are trying to find the ounces of a set amount, you can add the substance all at once instead of adding a little at a time.
Note that this measurement should be in ounces.

, If you want to measure out a second substance directly into the first, you must first zero out the scale as you did when you first put the dish. Afterward, add your second substance a little at a time until you measure out the correct amount of that substance, as well.

The water should boil within a few minutes., Get out a heat-proof bowl and carefully pour enough hot water to fill the bowl halfway. Avoid pouring in too much water or it will spill over the side of the bowl when you add the Nutella., Remove the lid from the jar of Nutella and set the jar into the bowl of hot water. Ensure that water can't get into the jar.

If you want to heat a small amount, you can scoop some into a small bowl. You can place this bowl of Nutella into the bowl of hot water as long as water won't come over the sides and into the Nutella.

, Let the Nutella sit in the hot water for about 5 minutes. Stir the Nutella with a wooden or metal spoon and remove it the jar from the water if it's melted. If not, let the Nutella sit in the hot water until it's melted.

This is a gentle way of heating the Nutella because you won't actually cook or overheat it.

Run hot water into a cup and put the spoon or knife in the hot water. Let it sit in the cup for about one minute. This will heat up the metal.You can also buy an electric butter spreader. This small knife will actually warm itself so you can use it to scoop out and melt a small amount of Nutella.

, Some people find that they always have coffee or tea with their toast and Nutella. For a shortcut, you could simply put your spoon or butter knife directly into your coffee or tea. Leave it in there for one minute to heat up the metal., Remove the butter knife or spoon from the hot water, coffee or tea. Quickly wipe it on a clean cloth so you don't get water into your jar of Nutella. Scrape up as much Nutella as you need and spread it on whatever you're using. Keep spreading the Nutella until the heat from the knife or spoon melts it.If your knife or spoon cools off too much, just wipe it clean and reinsert it into the hot water, coffee or tea for another minute.

Grab a measuring cup or graduated cylinder.,
Pour the substance into the container gradually.,
Make a note of the measurement before adding a second substance.",How to Measure Ounces2," If possible, choose a liquid measuring cup that has marks for fluid ounce on it.


Unlike ounces, fluid ounces are a measurement of volume. A single fluid ounce does not necessarily equal a single ounce.
Use a liquid measuring cup instead of a dry measuring cup. Liquid measuring cups have pour spouts and handles, while dry measuring cups have an even rim.






Fluid ounces are part of the American Standard system. The Metric system uses milliliters and liters.
Most graduated cylinders and beakers only measure in milliliters, but if you can find one with measuring marks for fluid ounces, these options are also acceptable.







, Slowly add your substance to the measuring cup until you measure out the desired amount of fluid ounces. If your pour too much into the container, simply pour a little of it back out.


You should keep the measuring cup on a steady surface, like a table or counter, when measuring out your substance. Look at the cup at eye level, from the outside of the cup, to ensure an accurate measurement.If you are trying to measure the fluid ounces of a set amount of liquid, you can pour the entire amount into your cup at once without having to worry about doing so a little at a time. Make sure that none of the substance splashes out as you work, though.

, If you want to measure out a second liquid as you combine it with the first, you need to make sure that you write down or otherwise note how much of the first liquid you measured out. From there, you can pour the second liquid into the first and measure it as you did with the first.


Note that your new measurement will need to equal the sum of the amount of fluid ounces you measured for your first liquid plus the amount of fluid ounces you need for your second liquid.
Repeat as needed until all of your liquids have been measured out.

Understand the pros and cons of estimates.,
Estimate 1 ounce of meat or cheese.,
Use the palm of your hand to measure out 3 ounces of meat, fish, or poultry.,
Roughly measure out 1 to 2 ounces of nuts or pretzels.",How to Measure Ounces3," An estimate should never be used when you need to know the precise number of ounces, so you are strongly advised to use a scale when following a recipe or some similar set of instructions. If precision is not required, however, you can use your hand to estimate the number of ounces for most foods.


A good time to use this is if you are dieting and quickly need to estimate an amount of food for the sake of portion control.






Note that this only works if you have an average sized adult hand. Moreover, since all hands are different sizes, you may or may not have success using this method of measurement.

, Place the meat or cheese on the meaty, thick part of your thumb, right along the base. For dense foods like these, this usually measures out to about 1 ounce.More specifically, the portion of your thumb you need to use is the part extending from the lowest joint to the base of your hand.







, Place the food directly into the palm of your hand without cupping it. For dense foods like these, this will usually come out to roughly 3 ounces.


Keep your hand as flat as possible during this estimate. Only curve the hand slightly, and only if needed to prevent the food from slipping off your palm.

, Cup your hand and pour the food into it. For less dense ingredients, like pretzels, this will usually measure out to about 1 ounce. For heavier nuts, this measurement is usually closer to 2 ounces.


Keep your fingers closed and contain the food completely within the cupped portion of your hand.

Determine ounces from pounds and tons.,
Convert grams to ounces.,
Estimate ounces from spoons and cups.",How to Measure Ounces4," Ounces, pounds, and tons are all parts of the American Standard system, so you can directly convert pounds and tons into ounces.

There are 16 ounces in 1 pound.To convert pounds to ounces, simply multiply the number of pounds by 16.
There are 32000 ounces in 1 ton. To convert tons to ounces, multiply the number of tons by 32000.

, If you know the amount of a substance in grams, you can convert that unit of mass into ounces with a simply calculation. There are 28.35 grams in 1 ounce, so you can determine the number of ounces by dividing the number of grams by 28.35.

For a quicker, less precise means of conversion, you can memorize a few estimates commonly used in everyday applications, like cooking.15 grams = 1/2 ounce
30 grams = 1 ounce
85 grams = 3 ounces
100 grams = 3.75 ounces
115 grams = 4 ounces
225 grams = 8 ounces
340 grams = 12 ounces
450 grams = 16 ounces



, You should use a scale to measure ounces whenever possible. Different foods and substances have different masses, so measuring the volume of one with a cup or measuring spoon will never give you an accurate reading. That being said, if you only need an estimated quantity, you can determine the number of ounces based on the number of spoons or cups used.

Memorize the following common estimates for everyday use:

3 tsp = 1 Tbsp = 1/2 ounce
2 Tbsp = 1/8 cup = 1 ounce
4 Tbsp = 1/4 cup = 2 ounces
5-1/3 Tbsp = 1/3 cup = 2.6 ounces
8 Tbsp = 1/2 cup = 4 ounces
12 Tbsp = 3/4 cup = 6 ounces
16 Tbsp = 1 cup = 8 ounces
32 Tbsp = 2 cups = 16 ounces

Start with a liquid measuring cup.,
Place the cup on a flat surface.,
Find the meniscus.,
Use a measuring spoon for small quantities.,
Measure very small amounts of ingredients with a syringe.",How to Measure Wet Ingredients1," Liquid measuring cups are the most accurate way to measure thin liquids, like water, milk, juice, and oils. They are made of transparent glass or plastic, and have markings on the sides to indicate volume in both metric and English units. You can find one at a grocery store, big-box store, kitchen-supply store, or even a dollar store., You won’t get as accurate a measurement if you’re holding the cup in your shaky hands, so set it on a counter or table. Now, pour the liquid in, until it reaches the correct line. Pour slowly, so you don’t have to worry about getting rid of excess.

, Crouch or lean down, so your eyes are level with the measurement line you’ve chosen. You will see a slight concave curve in the surface of the liquid. Make sure that the bottom of this arc, called the meniscus, touches the measurement line., If you’re measuring less than a quarter cup of a thin liquid--for instance, vanilla extract--use a measuring spoon to dole it out. Hold the spoon over a seperate bowl to catch any overflow, and gently pour in the liquid until it’s full. Empty the spoon into the recipe, and continue., It may look intimidating, but this tool will give you hyper-accurate results for small volumes. If you’re doing precision baking, a trip to the drugstore can net you a very useful syringe. Fill it up to the desired volume line according to the package directions, then squirt the liquid into the recipe."

Start with mild or sharp cheddar.,
Shred the cheese.You can shred cheese with a knife, box grater, or food processor.,
Bring the cheese to room temperature.,
Place the cheese in a microwave-safe bowl.,
Set the microwave on low heat for 15 seconds.,
Continue with 15 to 30 second intervals until the cheese is melted.",How to Melt Cheddar Cheese1," Cheddar cheese can be labeled mild, sharp, or extra sharp. The level of sharp indicates how long the cheese has been aged. The amount of aging increases as you go from mild to extra sharp. As the cheese ages, the texture of the cheese changes. Mild and sharp cheddar cheese have a smoother, creamier texture than extra sharp cheddar and will be easier to melt.It will require more heat to melt extra sharp cheddar then to melt less-aged cheddar cheese.
Mild and sharp cheddar cheese have a higher moisture content than extra sharp cheddar.;
, Using a box grater is the most common and easiest method. Grasp the cheese firmly in your hand and press the short end firmly against the blades of the box grater. Using localized pressure, move the block of cheese up and down along the grater.


It is best to shred the cheese while it is still cold. If you shred cheese when it is too warm, you will end up with mush.
If you do not want to shred the cheese yourself, you can buy cheese that has already been shredded. However, the end result will be creamier and taste better if you shred it yourself.If you’re having trouble shredding the cheddar, put it in the freezer for 10-30 minutes to harden it.

, Once grated, allow the shredded cheddar to remain out on the counter until it becomes room temperature. Doing this will lessen the length of time you’ll have to expose the cheddar to heat before it melts. Over exposure to heat will cause melted cheddar to become unpleasantly rubbery or greasy, so the less heat you have to use, the better., Pile the shredded cheddar into a bowl that can easily hold all of it, with room to spare. Do not place the cheese on a plate – when it begins to melt, it will run off the plate and you’ll have a melted mess to clean out of your microwave.

, Place the bowl of shredded cheese into the microwave. Close the microwave door. Use the lowest heat setting that your microwave has. Cheese prefers to be melted at the lowest heat possible.Start with 15 seconds.


Heating cheese at high temperatures sucks the moisture and fat out of the cheese. This will result in clumpy and/or greasy melted cheese., After the first 15 seconds, pull out the bowl and stir the cheese. Place it back in and set it for another 15 seconds. Continue in this manner until the cheese has reached the desired melted consistency.


The cheese should still be somewhat stringy once melted. Over-cooked cheese will be hard and crispy.

Use measuring cups of the exact right size.,
Fluff up the flour.,
Spoon it into your measuring cup.,
Level it off.",How to Measure Flour1," This is the best way to ensure accuracy when you're measuring out flour by volume. It’s more difficult to use the proper technique with an oversized measuring cup, since you can't complete the final step of leveling off the top. So, for example, if your recipe calls for 1 1/2 cups of flour, use both a one-cup dry measuring cup and a half-cup dry measuring cup. If your recipe calls for 2/3 cup of flour, measure out two 1/3 cups instead of using a larger cup.;
, Flour tends to come tightly packed in paper bags. If you don't fluff it up before measuring it, you'll end up measuring out more flour than you actually need for your recipe. Dig your spoon into the container the flour is in and fluff it up a little.You might want to consider storing your flour in a metal, plastic or glass container with a lid instead of keeping it in the bag it came in. That way your flour won't be as tightly packed, and it will be easier to reach in and fluff it up when you need to use some.

, Use a spoon to scoop flour into the cup until the cup is slightly overfull. Do not pack the flour into the cup; just lightly scoop it in until the cup is full and a small peak has formed in the center.

, Use a straight edge, such as the back of a knife, to level off the top by running it against the rim of the cup. Do this over the container so the excess flour drops back in. You're now ready to use the flour in your recipe. If it calls for additional cups, measure them the same way.

Avoid sticky situations with cooking oil.,
Measure malleable solids in a solid cup.,
Use the package guidelines for butter.,
Try a push-up measuring cup.",How to Measure Wet Ingredients2," Some sweeteners, like honey and molasses, are reluctant to leave the measuring cup once they’re there. (The good news is that they’re easier to eyeball--they are too thick to have a meniscus.) To encourage these syrups to slip out more easily, pour them into a liquid measuring cup that has been sprayed with cooking oil.To save even more time, in recipes in which you are measuring both oil and honey or molasses, measure the oil first, pour it into the recipe, then measure the sweetener., Some ingredients, like shortening and yogurt, are definitely not as runny as water. However, they’re too thick to measure using the dip-and-sweep method you might use for flour or sugar. In this case, it’s best to use a solid measuring cup and pack in the shortening or yogurt, using the back of a spoon to press it down firmly.


Line the cup with plastic wrap to make removal easier.Scoop the cup full of the ingredient. Push down on the ingredient with the back of a spoon, to make sure no air bubbles remain. Then, level off with a butter knife.Lift the ingredient out of the measuring cup with the plastic wrap, then transfer it to the recipe.

, Butter is a solid ingredient that is often melted and used as a liquid in recipes. Its advantage is that measurements are often clearly marked onto the stick; just slice along the guideline to remove the correct amount of solid butter, then melt if you so desire.Butter sticks come in a standard size, which makes measuring large quantities of butter even easier. A standard stick is ½ cup and ¼ pound, or 113 grams.

, Push-style measuring cups have a plunger you can set to the amount of the ingredient you want. Once you have filled them to that level, you can just push the ingredients out. This works really well with sticky ingredients like peanut butter and mayonnaise."

Acquire a kitchen scale.,
Set a liquid measuring cup on the scale.,
Set the scale to zero.,
Add the liquid slowly.,
Mix liquids if applicable.",How to Measure Wet Ingredients3," Many European recipes use weight or mass instead of volume to measure, especially for baking. Statistically, measuring by mass produces more accurate results, so especially if you bake a ton, you may find a kitchen scale useful.They’re easy to find in kitchen-supply shops and on Amazon.1 cup of water weighs 8 ounces, or 240 grams. 1 teaspoon of water weighs .17 ounces or 5 grams, while 1 tablespoon weighs .529 ounces or 15 grams.

, This will help you more accurately eyeball how much liquid you need to add. If you don’t have a liquid measuring cup, any sturdy (and preferably clear) container will do. Whichever vessel you choose, make sure it’s centered on the scale., This is called “taring” or “zeroing.” If you’re using a mechanical scale, twist the knob on the side until the weight dial reads “0.” If you’re using a digital scale, simply press “0” or “All Clear (AC).” Either way, this step is crucial, as it takes out the weight of the container you’re using.

, Pour in the liquid to the approximate volume measure that you’re trying to reach. Pour a thin stream, and make sure to have one eye on the scale’s reader in order to make sure that you don’t add too much. If you add too much, you can spoon it out until it’s at exactly the right weight., If the recipe calls for milk and vanilla mixed together, you can measure them both by weight in the same cup! Measure out the first liquid, then tare the scale. Add the correct weight of the second liquid, and you’re done.

Shred the cheese.,
Place room-temperature shredded cheese in a non-stick pot.,
Use low heat.,
Watch the cheese closely and stir it frequently.,
Remove the cheese from the heat.",How to Melt Cheddar Cheese2," Use a box grater to finely shred the cheddar. Shred the cheese right out of the refrigerator, since it shreds better when it’s cold. If it’s giving you trouble, place the cheddar in the freezer for 10-30 minutes to harden it. Then attempt to shred it again.


Feel free to use already-shredded cheddar for this. However, the cheddar usually has a better flavor if you grate it yourself from the block., After shredding it, allow the cheddar to reach room temperature before you apply heat. The outcome will be smoother and the cheese will require less heat to melt at room temperature. Pile the shredded cheese into a non-stick pot with ample room that can easily accommodate it.

, Put the pot of cheese over the lowest heat setting your stove will allow. Always melt cheese at the lowest heat possible.If you apply high heat to cheese, you risk losing the moisture and fat in the cheese, which results in lumpy or greasy cheese., Don’t leave cheese unattended on your stove, since it can melt and begin to burn very quickly. Stir the cheddar frequently to keep it moving around the pot. This will ensure the cheese is melted through evenly and prevent it from sticking to the pot and/or burning.

, Try not to melt the cheddar any longer than is necessary, since this can result in a rubbery consistency and effect the flavor. Once the cheese melts and reaches a string-like consistency, stir it once more and then remove it from the heat immediately."

Place shredded cheese into small oven-safe bowls.,
Add water to a saucepan and put it over high heat.,
Place a steamer basket in the pot and add the cheese bowls.,
Finished.

",How to Melt Cheddar Cheese3," Shred the cheddar straight out of the refrigerator, while it’s still cold. You can also use pre-shredded cheddar, if you prefer, although it will have a better flavor if you shred it yourself. Divide the cheese into several small, heat safe bowls. Ramekins would be a good choice.This method is best used when you only need to melt small amounts of cheddar. For example, you could steam-melt cheese to put on hamburgers for a rich, delicious flavor.

, Fill a saucepan one-third full or less with water and bring it to a rolling boil on your stovetop. Once the water reaches a boil, reduce the temperature of the burner to keep the water at a simmer., Situate a steamer basket into the saucepan, directly over the simmering water. Then, place the bowls inside the steamer basket. Let the water simmer for one to five minutes while your cheese melts. Check the cheese frequently. You do not want the cheese to melt too much.Ensure that the oven-safe bowls fit in your steamer basket before you transfer the cheese.
Consider tossing the cheese with a couple tablespoons of flour if you want it to have a very smooth, sauce-like texture.

Sift the flour.,
Scoop the flour into your measuring cup.,
Level it off with a straightedge.",How to Measure Flour2," Pour a little more flour than you need for your recipe into a flour sifter and sift it thoroughly over a bowl. Sifting flour aerates it, resulting in lighter baked goods. This might sound like a great thing to do for every recipe, but you should only sift flour if the recipe calls for doing so. For certain cakes and pastries, a denser final product is actually preferred.


If you don't have a flour sifter, you can sift flour just by stirring it. Pour it into a bowl and use a whisk to briskly stir it until it's light and fluffy., Use a spoon to measure the flour into a cup that’s the exact right size. Avoided using a larger measuring cup than you need, since it's harder to get an accurate measurement this way.

, Run the back of a knife or another straightedge across the rim of the measuring cup, letting the excess flour fall back into the container. You may now use your perfectly measured flour in your recipe.

Buy a kitchen scale.,
Find out the weight of the specific flour you're using.,
Do the math to find out how much total flour you need in ounces.,
Zero out the weight of your container.,
Add the flour slowly until the scale registers the correct weight.",How to Measure Flour3," If you’re getting into bread baking or pastry making and you want to make sure you’re measuring flour accurately, it’s worth it to invest in a kitchen scale. That’s because even the scoop and level method isn’t as accurate as weighing the flour to make sure it comes out to the right weight. Since being off by even half an ounce can make a difference in the outcome of your baked goods, using a scale is the top choice for serious bakers.

, A cup of white, unbleached flour comes out to approximately four and a quarter ounces, but other flours have different weights. If you're working with whole wheat flour, self-rising flour or another type of flour, find out exactly how much a cup should weigh. Here are the weights of commonly used specialty flours:Cake flour: 1 cup = 4 ounces
Self-rising flour: 1 cup = 4 ounces
Whole wheat flour: 1 cup = 4 ounces
Whole wheat pastry flour: 1 cup = 3 3/8 ounces

, If your recipe calls for 2 1/2 cups of white flour, for example, you'll need to figure out how many ounces that comes to. Do the math in your head or use a calculator to figure out how much you need to weigh out.

, Since whatever container you’re using to hold the flour shouldn’t count toward the weight of the flour, you have to subtract its weight from the final amount. You can do this by using your scale to ""zero out"" the weight of the container.


If you're using a mechanical scale, turn the knob back to the zero mark with the container on the scale.If you're using a digital scale, hit the “clear” button with the container on the scale.

, Once the container's weight has been zeroed out, you can add your flour. Scoop it into the container until the correct weight is reached. If you're using regular white flour, it should come to 4.25 ounces per cup. If you're using another flour, double check to see how much a cup should weigh.

You'll need measuring spoons for small amounts of dry ingredients like salt, baking powder, and baking soda.You'll probably want to buy two sets of measuring spoons so you don't need to stop and wash them if a recipe calls for the same measurement twice. You can also use measuring spoons for liquid ingredients, since the amount called for will probably be very small.;
, You'll need measuring cups to measure a variety of dry ingredients, like flour, sugar, brown sugar, rice, or oats. Most measuring cup sets come with these measuring cups: 1 cup, 3/4 cup, 1/2 cup, 1/3 cup and 1/4 cup. You can choose light plastic measuring cups that are easy to handle or heavy ones made of metal.


Choose measuring spoons that have strong handles. If you scoop into a firm ingredient using a measuring cup with a weak handle, it may snap.

, The most common way to measure dry ingredients by volume is to dip your measuring cup into the dry ingredient so that the cup is overflowing. Take the back of a knife or a flat spoon handle and sweep the excess across and off of the measuring cup.You can also use the dip and sweep method for small amounts of dry ingredients measured by spoons.

, Some cookbooks may recommend taking a spoon and filling your measuring cup with a dry ingredient before sweeping off the excess. Depending on how heavily you spoon in the ingredient, you may end up with a lot more of the ingredient than you need.To find out what your cookbook or recipe recommends, read the introduction by the author. The author will explain what tools and basic ingredients you'll need, as well as helpful techniques (like measuring ingredients).

, When you read an ingredient list for a recipe, you probably scan it for what ingredients you'll need. However, the ingredient list can offer useful clues about how to measure the dry ingredients. Pay close attention to the language used. Here are a few examples of measurement clues in the ingredient list:


""1 cup of flour, sifted"" means you should dip and scoop 1 cup of flour and then sift it.
""1 cup of sifted flour"" means you should sift flour and then measure out 1 cup of it to use in the recipe.
""1/2 cup of packed brown sugar"" means you should compress the brown sugar into the 1/2 cup measuring cup rather than scoop out 1/2 cup of brown sugar and then pack it down.

, Many people have grown up with measuring cups and spoons, but measuring by volume is usually something that people learn when baking. Baking often requires more accuracy so things rise, set, and react properly. Measuring ingredients by weight is more accurate than measuring by volume. You'll just need a small digital scale.


A digital kitchen scale usually has a small flat platform on the top where you can set bowls filled with ingredients for measuring. Some scales have raised containers that you can measure directly into.

, Place your digital scale on a firm, flat surface and turn it on. If it shows another number or reading, be sure to tare it. When you tare it, the scale should read 0.Read the owner's manual that came with your digital scale to learn about the features on your scale.

, Even simple digital kitchen scales offer a variety of measurements. You'll need to select if you want the scale to measure using ounces, grams, pounds or even a ratio of ounces to pounds.


Some scales will let you adjust or switch between measurements while the ingredient is on the scale being weighed.

, Place an empty bowl on the scale and tare the scale. When it reads 0, add your dry ingredient to the bowl until you get the amount needed for your recipe. You can tare the scale again and add another ingredient that you need to measure. Only add more ingredients to the bowl if that's what the recipe calls for.If you're unsure about combining the ingredients while weighing them, you could measure them in small separate bowls. This is useful if the recipe doesn't call for adding all the dry ingredients at once. Just remember to tare the scale after each measurement.

, Take a dry measuring cup and scoop it into a container of brown sugar. Use your fingers, the palm of your hand, or the back of a spoon to press the sugar down as much as you can. This will give you an accurate measurement.The brown sugar should keep the shape of the measuring cup when you dump it out. If it spills out like sand, it wasn't packed down enough and you don't have enough sugar in your recipe.

, Since flour can pack down as it sits, stir it a little before measuring. This will break it up and introduce a little air. Dip your dry measuring cup into the flour so the cup is overflowing. You can then level off the excess by using a bench scraper or another flat kitchen tool or handle.You can stir the flour using a spoon, a knife, or a whisk. Just use something that will move the flour around a little and break it up.

, You'll usually see sifting mentioned when baking with powdered sugar. This is because powdered sugar forms a lot of little lumps as it sits. Avoid scooping and measuring powdered sugar while it's still lumpy or it won't mix into your other ingredients well and you'll end up with small lumps of powdered sugar. Always sift powdered sugar before measuring or weighing it.For example, if you don't sift the powdered sugar, but just mix it into butter for a frosting recipe, you'll end up with small white lumps of sugar in your frosting.

Measure sugar and molasses into a mixing bowl.,
Combine the molasses and sugar in a mixer.,
Consider mixing the molasses and sugar with a fork.,
Double or triple the batch.",How to Make Your Own Brown Sugar1," Pour 1 cup (200 g) of granulated sugar into a mixing bowl. Add molasses according to your taste or the type of brown sugar you want. For light brown sugar, use 2 tablespoons (40 g) of molasses. For dark brown sugar, you can use up to 1/4 cup (84 g) of molasses./images/thumb/1/1e/Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-4-preview.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-4-preview.jpg
/images/thumb/1/1e/Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-4-preview.jpg/v4-300px-Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-4-preview.jpg









Ensure that you're using true molasses, not blackstrap molasses. Blackstrap molasses is more refined, less sweet, and higher in sodium than true molasses.;
, For the best texture, use a stand or electric mixer to combine the molasses and sugar until the mixture looks fluffy and golden brown. This can take several minutes.

You can also mix the brown sugar by combining the ingredients in a food processor.

, If you don't have a mixer or just want to make a little brown sugar, you can put the molasses and sugar into a small bowl. Use a fork to combine the mixture until it becomes brown sugar./images/thumb/c/c2/Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-6-preview-Version-2.jpg

If you're baking with the brown sugar, you don't even need to combine the sugar and molasses; just add the ingredients to the recipe. For example, if you're making cookies that call for brown sugar, just add extra granulated sugar and the molasses along with the other ingredients.

, If you want to make a large batch of brown sugar to use in several recipes, you can easily double or triple the ingredients. Use a large mixing bowl and electric or stand mixer to combine the brown sugar. Whisk the sugar and molasses for about 5 minutes."

Reduce the water to a simmer and wait until the sugar dissolves.,
Take the pot off the stove and let it cool.,
Transfer the mixture to a bottle.,
Store the sugar water in the refrigerator.",How to Make Sugar Water1," This will give you about 1 ½ cups (350 milliliters) of sugar water.If you need to make more/less sugar water, then use one part water to one part sugar.;
, The high temperature will help dissolve the sugar water faster. Be sure to stir often to help the sugar dissolve.

, As soon as the water begins to boil, reduce the heat and bring the water to a simmer. It will take about three minutes for the sugar to dissolve., Set it down onto a heat-resistant surface and let the mixture return to room temperature.

, Place a funnel into the neck of a glass bottle, and carefully pour the sugar water into the bottle. If you cannot find a bottle, you can use a glass jar. Put the cap on the bottle and close it tightly.

, Use it within one month.You can use sugar water to make lemonade or cocktails.

Use honey instead of brown sugar.,
Substitute maple syrup for brown sugar.,
Try coconut or date sugar.",How to Make Your Own Brown Sugar2," If you don't have brown sugar or molasses on hand, consider using honey in place of the brown sugar in a recipe. To substitute honey, use 1/2 cup (170 g) to 3/4 cup (255 g) of honey for each 1 cup (200 g) of brown sugar called for and add 1/4 teaspoon of baking powder. You should also reduce the liquids in the recipe by 20% and turn down the oven temperature by 25 degrees.Avoid substituting honey in recipes that need you to cream butter with the brown sugar. Instead, use honey in soft-textured cake, ice cream, or pudding recipes.

, You can use maple syrup instead of brown sugar, but you'll need to reduce the liquid in the recipe by 1/2 cup (120 ml) for each 1 cup (240 ml) of maple syrup you use. Avoid using maple syrup in recipes where you need to cream butter with the sugar. Consider substituting maple syrup in pudding, candy, caramel, and ice cream recipes.If you have maple sugar, you can substitute equal amounts for the brown sugar and you won't need to reduce the liquid in a recipe.

, If you have coconut or date sugar in your pantry, you can use it to replace brown sugar in a recipe. You can use it in caramels and candies, but it does melt 10 degrees lower than standard sugar. You can also bake with it although your baked goods may have a drier texture.If you want to add moisture, consider adding applesauce or mashed banana.

Store the brown sugar in an airtight container.,
Soften brown sugar in the microwave.,
Place a piece of bread with the brown sugar.",How to Make Your Own Brown Sugar3," Put the brown sugar in an airtight container in your pantry. You can store the brown sugar at room temperature indefinitely, but it may harden over time as it dries out./images/thumb/f/f8/Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-7-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-7-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/f/f8/Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-7-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-7-preview-Version-2.jpg









If you don't have an airtight storage container, you can keep the brown sugar in a plastic food storage bag with a zipper.

, If you need to soften brown sugar quickly, put the lump of brown sugar into a microwave-safe bowl. Moisten a paper towel with water and lay it over the brown sugar. Microwave the brown sugar for 15 to 20 seconds and check to see if it's softened. If not, microwave it for another 15 to 20 seconds.If the brown sugar is so hard that it's hard to divide the lump into a bowl, add a few teaspoons of water to the sugar before you microwave it.

, You can also soften brown sugar by storing it with a piece of fresh bread for a few days. The moisture from the bread softens the sugar. Just be sure you remember to toss out the bread before too long because it will dry out./images/thumb/6/6d/Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Make-Your-Own-Brown-Sugar-Step-8-preview-Version-2.jpg

Read your recipe carefully.,
Measure with a scale.,
Measure wet ingredients like water, milk and oil with a liquid measuring cup.,
Measure ingredients like fruits and vegetables by weight or by filling a liquid measuring cup with the ingredient up to the line for the amount you want to measure.

,
Use dry measuring cups to measure dry ingredients.,
Measure butter either by using the marks on its wrapper or by treating softened butter as a malleable ingredient.

,
Measure malleable ingredients like shortening with a dry measuring cup lined with plastic wrap.

,
Measure small amounts of ingredients with measuring spoons.

,
Measure very small amounts of ingredients with a syringe.",How to Measure in Cooking,"


If a descriptor of the ingredient comes before the ingredient (i.e. 1 cup chopped green bell pepper), you measure after the ingredient is in that state (i.e. chopped).
If the ingredient name is followed by a comma and then the descriptor (i.e. 1 cup green bell pepper, chopped), you measure and then chop or do what needs to be done to the ingredient.;
,


The most accurate method of measuring ingredients is weighing.
Many cookbooks include measurements in weight.
A scale with a tare function is particularly useful because you can weigh each ingredient separately without having to subtract the weights of the previous ingredients.

,


Liquid measuring cups are transparent, have extra room above the top measurement line and usually have a pouring spout.
Place the cup on a flat surface and pour the liquid until it reaches the correct line on the measuring cup.
Lean down until you are at eye level and make sure that the bottom of the arc at the liquid's surface, which is known as its meniscus, touches the measurement line.

,,


Dry measuring cups are usually opaque and made of metal or plastic. They are designed for measuring dry ingredients and their use will minimize error in measuring dry ingredients.
Scoop the measuring cup or spoon into the dry ingredient and sweep off the excess with a knife.
Use the measuring cup or measuring spoon that holds the amount that you need of a dry ingredient.
If you do not have a measuring cup or spoon that holds the precise amount, use a smaller cup or spoon and add more of them.
Don't measure in a cup that is too big for what you are measuring.

,,,, The type of syringe available at drugstores for medicines works well for this purpose.

Fill a pot with 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water and 2 cups (400 grams) of white, granulated sugar.,
Set the pot on the stove and bring the mixture to a boil.,
Reduce the water to a simmer and wait for the sugar to dissolve.,
Remove the pot from the burner and let the water cool.,
Transfer the mixture to a bottle or jar.,
Store the sugar water in the refrigerator.",How to Make Sugar Water2," If you need to make a smaller or larger amount, then use one part water and two parts sugar.

, Be sure to stir the water often to help the sugar dissolve.

, Once the water begins to boil, quickly lower the heat and bring it to a simmer; this prevents the sugar from scorching and becoming caramelized.

, Set the pot down on a heat-resistant surface and leave it uncovered until the mixture reaches room temperature.

, Place a funnel over the bottle or jar opening, and slowly pour the liquid inside. Replace the cap or lid and tighten it.

, It will stay fresh for a few weeks to about a month.

Remove the pot from the stove and let it cool.,
Fill the hummingbird feeder and store the rest of the sugar water in the refrigerator.,
Maintain your hummingbird feeder.,
Consider keeping other insects away.",How to Make Sugar Water3," Do not use red food coloring, honey, or any other type of sugar; any of these things may end up harming the hummingbirds. Honey spoils too quickly, and low-calorie and artificial sweeteners do not give hummingbirds enough calories.Hummingbirds are attracted to the color red; consider using a red-colored hummingbird feeder. This will be more effective than dying the water red.

, Even though you are using much more water than sugar, you will still need to heat it in order for the sugar to dissolve completely.

, This should take one to two minutes.Boiling the water is important, because the high heat will kill any bacteria that might be in the water., Set the pot down on a heat-resistant surface and let the mixture cool. During this time, you can clean your hummingbird feeder or make a new one.

, The sugar water will later about two weeks in the fridge., If you wish to attract hummingbirds with tasty sugar water, you will need to change it every two to three days—and everyday if it is hot outside. Hummingbirds will not drink spoiled sugar water. Also, be sure to keep your hummingbird feeder in the shade; keeping it out in the sun will cause the sugar to spoil faster., Hummingbirds are not the only creatures who like nectar; bees and ants will also flock to your sugar water. Consider purchasing a hummingbird feeder with a moat that can be filled with water, or some bee guards.

Consider using brown sugar instead of white.,
Consider adding some rosewater.,
Make some no-cook sugar water using castor sugar.,
Add herbs to the sugar water to make flavored syrup.",How to Make Sugar Water4," This will give you a richer flavor. It will also give the drink a golden tint; because of this, it is better to use the brown sugar water for rum-based drinks instead of clear drinks.You can also use honey instead of sugar for a sweet, golden syrup., Substitute part of the water in your recipe for some rosewater. Be sure to use pure, edible rosewater; some rosewater types are for cosmetic purposes only and not meant to be consumed., Do not use confectioner's or powdered sugar. Simply pour one part castor sugar and one part water into a bottle, close the bottle, and shake it for a few minutes until the sugar dissolves. The fine grains of castor sugar make it easier to dissolve in water, so you don't need to cook it., Once the sugar has dissolved, add the herbs of your choice, and take the pot off the stove. Let the herbs sit in the sugar water for an hour, then pour the sugar water into a new container through a strainer. Discard the herbs and store the flavored syrup in the refrigerator. Some great herbs include:Fresh basil, mint, rosemary, and thyme leaves
Fresh or dried lavender flowers
Pieces of fresh fruit or berries
Lemon, lime, orange, or grapefruit zest
Vanilla bean pods or cinnamon sticks

Select your fruit.,
Wash the fruit.,
Cut the fruit into pieces.,
Place the fruit in a heavy pot.,
Add the sugar.,
Cover with brandy.,
Add more throughout the summer.,
Allow the mixture to soak for several months.,
Use as desired.",How to Make Tutti Frutti1," For best results, choose a variety of fleshy summer fruit and use it while the fruit is in its ripest stage.Use a blend of multiple fruits instead of using only one type.
Note that you do not need to add all of the fruit at the same time. You can gradually add different types to the mixture as the season progresses.
Strawberries, raspberries, cherries, peaches, apricots, pineapple, nectarines, red currents, pears, seedless grapes, and plums are all popular choices.
Avoid berries that are heavily seeded, like blackberries, and fruit that is too soft, like bananas. Acidic citrus fruits and watery fruits (cantaloupe, watermelon, etc.) are also poor choices.
You may also want to avoid dark fruits, like blueberries, since they can discolor some of the lighter fruits in the mixture.;
, Thoroughly rinse the fruit under running water, using your hands to scrub away any visible dirt. Dry the fruit with clean paper towels.

Even though the alcohol will kill most bacteria, clean fruit is more sanitary and safer to use than unwashed fruit.

, Remove all pits, large seeds, and stems. Cut larger fruits into small pieces.

Raspberries and other small fruits can usually be added to the mixture as they are.
Large fruits will need to be cut into bite-size pieces or smaller. Medium fruits, like strawberries, may need to be cut into halves or quarters.
It's also a good idea to measure the volume of fruit you have after you cut it. Measurements don't need to be exact, but you should have a fairly accurate estimate of the amount of fruit being used.

, Transfer the prepared fruit to a heavy ceramic or glass container. Spread it out as evenly as possible.

Consider using a crock, German rum pot, glass pickle jar, or ceramic cookie jar.
Avoid using metal or plastic containers.

, Sprinkle an equal amount of sugar over the fruit in the pot. Toss gently to combine.

The amount of sugar should always be equal to the amount of fruit. If you only have 2 cups (500 ml) of fruit at the start, you should only use 2 cups (500 ml) of sugar. Increase the volume of sugar only as you increase the volume of fruit.

, Pour enough brandy over the fruit mixture to cover it completely.You only need just enough brandy to cover the fruit. More brandy may need to be added later on if the volume of fruit increases or if some of the liquid evaporates.

, Ideally, tutti frutti should be started at the beginning of summer. Add more fruit as it comes into season throughout the rest of the summer months.

Continue adding more fruit every few weeks until the end of summer or until the pot is full. When you add more fruit, you must also add more sugar. Make sure there is enough brandy to keep the fruit submerged, as well.
Keep a lid on the pot of fruit as it sits out. If you don't have a lid, use a tight sheet of aluminum foil or plastic wrap.
The pot of fruit should sit in a cool place and out of direct sunlight. Stir the fruit every few days to make sure that it stays submerged. Stirring also helps to dissolve the sugar.

, Once all the fruit has been added, cover the pot and let it sit in a cool, shady area for at least three months.

Traditionally, tutti frutti is allowed to sit until late November or early December. You can technically enjoy it earlier than that, but the flavors will not be fully developed.

, Once ready, tutti frutti can be enjoyed in numerous ways. It can be consumed on its own or used as a garnish for other desserts.

You can serve the tutti frutti with its syrup over ice cream, cake, custard, or similar desserts.
Alternatively, you can strain the liquid and enjoy the preserved fruit on its own or use it when making baked goods.

Add the vanilla extract.,
Divide the mixture into three portions.,
Add food coloring to each bowl.,
Soak the papaya for 12 to 24 hours.,
Strain the papaya.,
Dry the fruit.,
Store in an airtight container.",How to Make Tutti Frutti2," Peel off the skin of the papaya and dice it into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) cubes. One medium green papaya will usually yield around 2 cups (500 ml) when diced.

Peel the skin off the papaya, then cut off the stem end.
Slice the papaya in half and use a spoon to dig out the seeds. Dig away the fleshy white skin beneath the seeds, as well.
Use a sharp knife to cut both halves into slices, then cut each slice into small cubes.

, Pour 4 cups (1 L) of water into a 4-qt (4-L) or larger saucepan. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat., Once the water reaches a boil, add the chopped papaya. Turn the heat down to medium-low and allow the papaya to cook for 3 minutes.

You only need to cook the papaya long enough to blanch it. It should not become tender or mushy during this time.
Leave the saucepan uncovered while the papaya simmers.

, Turn the heat off completely and remove the pan from the burner. Allow the papaya to sit in the hot water for another 5 minutes.

Cover the saucepan as the papaya continues to soak.
The papaya should become semi-transparent after it soaks. If it still looks opaque, continue soaking the papaya for another few minutes before proceeding.

, Pour the blanched papaya through a colander to drain the water.

After draining the water, set the papaya aside until the time comes for you to add it to the syrup.

, Combine 2 cups (500 ml) of sugar with 3 to 4 cups (750 to 1000 ml) of water in a medium or large saucepan.

For best results, use a saucepan with a minimum volume of 4 quarts (4 L). You can use the same saucepan initially used to blanch the papaya, but you should quickly rinse it out with running water before doing so.

, Boil the sugar mixture over medium-high heat on your stove until the sugar appears to dissolve.

You'll know when the sugar is dissolved based on the appearance of the mixture. If the mixture is still cloudy, the sugar hasn't dissolved yet. Once the mixture becomes clear, the sugar has been dissolved.

, After the sugar dissolves, add the strained papaya cubes to the syrup. Mix well to combine., Reduce the heat the medium-low and allow the papaya to simmer in the syrup until the syrup thickens.The syrup must reach a ""one thread"" consistency. To test the consistency, remove a small spoonful of syrup and let it cool slightly for a few minutes. Pinch the syrup in between your thumb and index finger, then pull your fingers apart. A single thread of syrup should form between your two fingers and, if you pull your fingers apart gently, that thread should not break.

, Turn off the heat and remove the saucepan from the stove. Add the vanilla extract to the contents of the pan and stir well to combine., Ladle the papaya and syrup into three separate bowls, measuring the mixture out in relatively equal proportions.

The measurements don't need to be exact, but they should be fairly even if you want to have an equal amount of each color. You also need to make sure that the papaya pieces in each bowl are covered with a fair amount of syrup.
Glass bowls work best for this. Avoid plastic bowls since they may get stained by the food coloring.

, Add one to four drops of green food coloring to one bowl, one to four drops of yellow food coloring to the next, and one to four drops of red food coloring to the last bowl. Mix well to disperse the color evenly.

It's better to start with a small amount of food coloring (one or two drops). Stir the food coloring into the syrup and papaya mixture. If the mixture seems too light, you can add a few more drops of food coloring at that time.

, Cover all three bowls and allow them to sit out at room temperature for 12 to 24 hours.Choose a relatively cool location that is out of direct sunlight.
If the bowls you use do not have lids, cover them with aluminum foil or plastic wrap.
As the papaya cubes soak, the food coloring you just mixed in should dye the fruit, causing the cubes to take on a bright hue. The papaya should also absorb more of the syrup, becoming sweeter in the process.

, After the papaya has been allowed to soak, pour the papaya and syrup though a colander or strainer. Discard the syrup and reserve the papaya.

Keep a plate or several layers of paper towel beneath the wire rack to prevent the syrup from staining your kitchen counter.
Alternatively, you can spread the papaya out on plates covered with multiple layers of paper towel and allow them to dry that way.

, Spread the papaya cubes over a wire net cooling rack. Allow them to dry for several hours, or until they no longer feel sticky to the touch., Mix the different colors of tutti frutti together in an airtight jar. Seal the jar, then store and use when needed.

At room temperature, the tutti frutti should be good for several days to one week. If you want to store the tutti frutti for a longer period, you should refrigerate it. When sealed and refrigerated properly, tutti frutti can remain edible for several months.
Tutti frutti is often used in fruit cakes and Indian desserts like dil pasand. It can also be used in muffins, ice cream, cookies, breads, or other baked goods.

Color your glaze.,
Tinker with the amounts.,
Add other flavors.,
Make it dairy-free.,
Try granulated sugar.,
Use brown sugar instead.",How to Make Sugar Glaze2," Make your treat pop off the plate and catch the eye. For every cup of sugar used, add ten drops of food coloring to your mix. Note that if you don’t use the whole batch right away, you will need to stir the glaze up again, because the food coloring may redistribute unevenly as the glaze sits., Don’t feel beholden to precise measurements. Add more milk or sugar as you please. Adjust your recipe by small increments until you find your favorite balance. For a thinner glaze, use more liquid. For a thicker glaze, use less., Add a ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of cinnamon for every cup of sugar. Or try a ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of nutmeg instead.Experiment with orange, lemon, and/or lime zest, or your favorite fresh herbs.

, Make the lactose-intolerant and vegan people in your life happy, too! Substitute water for milk.Or, use dairy-free alternatives like soy, almond, or cashew milk and margarine. If using a nut-based milk, make sure no one has allergies before serving.

, If you don’t have any powdered sugar, don’t worry. Just expect granulated sugar glaze to be a little more see-through and less eye-catching. Stir together equal parts sugar and water in a pot on the stove. Then simply set the heat to high and stir to dissolve the sugar.To thicken your glaze, keep the heat on so the mixed liquid reduces to your desired consistency.

, If you love the rich taste of brown sugar, use that as the base to your glaze! In a saucepan, mix together 3/4 cup (165 g) of dark brown sugar, 3 tablespoons (44 ml) of butter or margarine, 1 teaspoon (15 ml) of vanilla extract, 1/4 cup (60 ml) of heavy cream, and 1/4 teaspoon (1 g) of salt. Turn the heat on to medium. Keep stirring to help the sugar dissolve. Once the mixture begins to boil, switch the heat off, remove from the stove, and stir until it turns to syrup."

Keep different size and shaped noodles on hand to make meals more interesting. Dried pasta can be added to soups, stews or casseroles, it can be used as a bed for your favorite stir-fry, to add some bulk to your meal or it can be the star of the show - a quick go-to meal by simply adding your favorite jarred sauce.;
, Of course you can use a jar of spaghetti sauce to pour over spaghetti for a quick meal any night of the week, but think outside the box a little when it comes to this pantry staple. You would be surprised how many different ways spaghetti sauce can be used. The great thing about spaghetti sauce is that all of the cooking has been done and that all-day flavor is already sealed in. There are so many varieties on the store shelves that you can get a sauce with whatever flavor combination you prefer, or you can get a simple marinara sauce and spice it up your own way by adding fresh herbs and vegetables to suit your palate and your menu.

, Boxes or cans of prepared beef, chicken and vegetable broth are a must have pantry staple. When it comes to quick cooking you should not pass up any opportunity to add flavor. You can do this by substituting broth in place of water to add extra flavor to any recipe. You can even cook your rice in broth instead of water. If you cook often the larger boxes of broth can be stored in the refrigerator after opening so you can use as much or as little as you need and they can sometimes be a better bargain than the cans. If you do wind up with leftover broth in an opened container and are afraid that you will not be able to use it quickly, pour it into ice cube trays and freeze it. You can pop out as many cubes as you need and melt them right into your recipe. You can even get fancy by adding some dried herbs to your broth cubes before freezing for extra flavor.

, Rice is a great way to add bulk to a meal. Serving a stir fry of meat and vegetables over rice makes a delicious and satisfying meal. Rice is also a great way to add some whole grains to your diet by using brown rice or wild rice instead of white rice. Experiment with different flavors and find one that your family enjoys. Rice also makes a great side dish either by itself, with vegetables mixed in or simply topped with your favorite spaghetti sauce.

, Condensed soups are a fabulous way to add both moisture and flavor to quick cooking meals. You will find recipe ideas right on the soup can labels and there have been entire cookbooks written around the theme of cooking with condensed soups. Cream of mushroom, cream of chicken, cream of celery and condensed cheese soup are probably the most popular. Take a close look at the soup selection the next time you are in the grocery store. Read the recipes on the labels and stock up on any that you can incorporate into your weekly menu planning. If nothing else, you can make soup for lunch or dinner on a cold rainy day. Don't forget the chicken noodle in case somebody doesn't feel well.

, Having a stock of herbs and spices on hand will really help ""spice"" up your quick meals. Kosher salt, whole black peppercorns (to grind in a pepper grinder), parsley, basil, oregano, rosemary, thyme, cumin, chili powder, mustard powder and paprika would be a great starting point. Unless you cook a lot, buy these items in the smallest quantity possible. Dried herbs and spices can lose their flavor and it is recommended that you should replace them after 6 months. You will wind up wasting money if you buy the jumbo size container of paprika, only use it once or twice and wind up throwing it away.

, Worcestershire, soy sauce, hot pepper sauce, and an assortment of vinegars are some liquid condiments that can pack a punch when it comes to adding flavor to your quick fix meals.

, Having a variety of canned tomato products in your pantry is a great way to add all-day cooked flavor to your meals. You can add variety by mixing up the size of the tomatoes, from whole to finely diced. You can even purchase the cans with herbs and spices already added.

, Beans are a great source of fiber and an excellent way to add bulk to your meals, but cooking with dried beans can take a very long time because you typically have to soak them overnight and then cook them for hours until they soften. Canned beans give you the same benefits in a fraction of the time and if you stock up when they are bargain-priced they can be beneficial to your wallet as well.

, This is an absolute cooking staple. Even though oil is a fat, extra virgin olive oil is considered a healthy fat because it contains antioxidants like Vitamin E, it can lower you bad cholesterol while raising your good cholesterol and studies have shown that extra virgin olive oil can actually help prevent heart disease and certain types of cancer. You should keep in mind, though, that even with all of these health benefits, extra virgin olive oil is still a fat and it should be consumed in moderation. Two tablespoons per day should be your limit. There are many varieties of extra virgin olive oil on the market and some can be very expensive. Do a little taste testing to find a moderately priced brand that suits your palate and watch for it to go on sale.

Leave the beans out on your kitchen counter as they soak. You do not need to keep them in the refrigerator or on the stove.;
, Discard the water by pouring the contents of the bowl through a colander or sieve. While the beans are still in the colander, rinse them thoroughly with cool water.


Check the beans before draining them. Any that floated to the surface might be broken or otherwise bad, so you should discard these and continue working with the rest of the batch.

, Place the beans in a medium to large saucepan and cover with water. Bring the water to a boil, then allow the beans to boil for 1 minute.


After blanching the beans for one minute, quickly turn off the heat and remove the saucepan from the stove. Pour the contents of the saucepan through a colander to drain the water.
While the beans are still in the colander, it's a good idea to rinse the saucepan. That same saucepan can then be used later in the process.

, Quickly rinse the beans in cool, running water.


By rapidly cooling them in this manner, you stop any residual heat from prematurely cooking the beans any further.
If desired, you can blanch and cool the beans once more. Doing so is not strictly necessary, however, and you should be able to move into the next step after only blanching and cooling once.

, Return the beans to the rinsed saucepan and cover them with water. Sprinkle a pinch of salt into the water, as well.


The water should only cover the beans by about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm).

, Place the saucepan on the stove over medium-high heat. Allow the water to reach a rolling boil, then reduce the heat to low or medium-low.


Leave the lid off the saucepan as it reaches a boil. After lowering the heat, though, place the lid back on.

, Allow the beans to cook at a low simmer for 60 to 90 minutes, or until they become very soft.As they cook, you should occasionally use a slotted spoon to stir the beans and push them beneath the surface of the water.
If scum starts forming on the surface of the water, carefully skim it off with a spoon.
Also note that some of the water may evaporate as the beans cook. When this happens, add just as much water as needed to keep the beans covered.
When you think the beans are ready, carefully fish out one bean and pinch it between your fingers. You should be able to easily crush the bean once the batch is ready.

, Pour the contents of the saucepan through a colander or fine sieve, draining the water and retaining the beans.


If desired, you can reserve the drained cooking liquid for use when making the paste. It isn't a big deal if you drain it away, however, since fresh water can be used in its place if necessary.

, Pour the dry beans into your pressure cooker and add just enough water to cover them by roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm).


Note that you do not need to pre-soak the beans when using a pressure cooker.

, Keep the lid off the pressure cooker and place it on the stove over medium-high heat. After the water reaches a boil, let it continue at a boil for 1 minute.


Pour the contents of the pressure cooker through a sieve or colander as soon as that minute ends. The point of this step is merely to boil away any surface impurities, not to cook the beans.
If desired, you can blanch the beans twice for an even cleaner taste. Doing so only once is usually sufficient, though.

, Place the rinsed beans back in the pressure cooker. Add the same about of water as before—enough to cover the beans by about 1 inch (2.5 cm)—and sprinkle in a pinch of salt.


Make sure that you rinse the pressure cooker before placing the beans back inside. If you don't rinse the pressure cooker, some of the impurities you boiled away will still linger and may affect the final flavor.

, Put the lid on the pressure cooker and lock it into place. Allow the pressure to build over high heat.


Follow the manufacturer's instructions to determine the proper rated pressure to use. This will vary depending on model and manufacturer, so you will need to rely on the instructions that come with your particular pressure cooker for specifics.

, Once the correct pressure has been reached, lower the heat and continue cooking the beans for 20 to 25 minutes.Do not attempt to open the lid of the pressure cooker at any time during the cooking process.

, Turn off the heat and set the pressure cooker aside for approximately 10 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally, then open the lid.


At this point, the beans should be soft enough to easily smash in between your fingers.

, Pour the contents of the pressure cooker through the colander, draining the water and retaining the beans.


If desired, you can save some of the cooking liquid for use when making the paste, but doing so is not strictly necessary.

, Place the beans in a colander or sieve, then rinse them for several minutes under cool water.


When using a slow cooker, you do not need to pre-soak the beans or blanch them. You should still rinse them under running water to remove most of the dirt clinging to the surface.

, Place the beans in your slow cooker and cover them with roughly 2 inches (5 cm) of water. Add a pinch of salt, as well.

, Cover the slow cooker and turn it onto ""low."" Allow the beans to cook for approximately six hours.


Do not stir the beans or otherwise remove the lid during the cooking process. When you remove the lid, you release some of the built-up heat needed to help cook the beans. As a result, you may need to increase the overall cooking time.
When you think the beans are ready, test them by picking one up and squeezing it between your fingers. It should be soft enough to crush without any difficulty.

, Pour the contents of the slow cooker through the colander to drain the water.


If desired, you can save some of the cooking liquid to use when making the paste, but doing so isn't required. Fresh water can be used instead.

, Return the cooked beans to the pot and add 1 cup (200 g) of sugar.If using the standard stovetop method or slow cooker method to cook the beans, place the beans in a saucepan. When using the pressure cooker method, you can return the beans to the pressure cooker, but leave the lid off.

, Place the pot on your stove over medium heat. Stir the sugar and beans together with a spoon or spatula until the sugar completely melts, coating the beans evenly.


Taste-test the beans during this step. You can add up to 1 cup (200 g) of additional sugar if you would prefer sweeter paste.

, Continue cooking and stirring the beans and sugar together over medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes. There should be no visible grains of sugar remaining when finished.


If the contents of the pot start becoming too dry or sticky, add a little reserved cooking liquid or fresh water into the pot 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) at a time.

, Smash the beans against the bottom and sides of the pot using your mixing spoon or spatula. Continue until all the beans have been crushed into a chunky paste.


Alternatively, you could crush the beans using a potato masher. Doing so will still create a chunky paste but may save time.

, If the beans aren't already in a colander or fine mesh sieve, transfer them into one now. Use the back of a spoon or spatula to mash the beans through the colander.Most of the skins will be too thick to fit through the gaps of the colander, but with some effort, the tender interiors should pass through.
Place your stockpot or pressure cooker beneath the colander as you mash the beans. The insides should pass through the gaps and fall directly into the pot.

, Add 1 cup (200 g) of sugar to the mashed beans in your pot. Place the pot on the stove over medium heat and begin stirring.


You can combine the beans and sugar in either a saucepan or pressure cooker, but if you use your pressure cooker, keep the lid and pressure off during this stage.

, Stir and cook the beans, tasting them once the initial batch of sugar melts. You can add up to 1 cup (200 g) of additional sugar if you would like sweeter paste.


It's best to add the sugar in 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup (60 to 125 ml) batches to avoid accidentally adding too much at once.

, Cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the beans absorb the grainy sugar and a smooth, moderately thick paste forms.


If the paste starts drying out or sticking to the pot, you can add 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of reserved cooking liquid or fresh water to help moisten them.
Try drawing a line along the bottom of the pot. If you can see the bottom of the pot for more than 2 seconds after doing this, the paste should be thick enough, and you should turn off the heat.

, As soon as the red bean paste has finished cooking, spoon it out of the container and into a separate bowl or dish.Allow the paste to sit out at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes. It should continue to thicken as it cools, but may not be moldable yet.

, Cover the bowl of paste with plastic wrap and place everything in the refrigerator. Leave it there until the paste cools completely.


Once the paste completely cools, it should be thick enough to hold its form when molded or otherwise handled.

, Transfer the red bean paste to an airtight plastic container or resealable plastic bag and keep it in the refrigerator for three to four days.


If you want to extend the freshness period so that the paste lasts up to a full week, tightly wrap the paste in plastic wrap before placing it in a resealable plastic bag.

, Red bean paste can be frozen for up to one month, but frozen paste can often become grainy, so this option is less than ideal.


If you do choose to freeze the paste, separate it into 1/4 cup (60 ml) portions and individually wrap each portion with plastic wrap. Place the bundles in a freezer-safe plastic bag, then put the entire package in your freezer.

, Red bean paste can be used in a variety of Asian sweets and other dishes. In most cases, you'll want to thaw the paste to room temperature before using it.

Know which cuts pose a higher risk for bacterial contamination.",How to Understand Cuts of Beef," These are loin, brisket, chuck, shank, round, short plate, flank and rib and are known as primal cuts. From these 8 main cuts there are many different minor beef cuts and are known as subprimal cuts. Retail beef is usually labeled with the primal and sub-primal information.;
, The loin is found on the top of the cow directly behind the rib. Loin is a very tender cut of beef without much marbling and can be cooked quickly without it toughening. This is because the loin is not a heavily used muscle and does not contain much connective tissue. Loin tends to be the most expensive cut of beef.


Know the subprimal cuts from the loin. The loin can be divided into short loin and sirloin. The short loin yields more tender meat cuts than the sirloin, although both are still considered prized cuts.
Some common cuts from the short loin area are tenderloin roast, filet mignon, T-bone steak, strip steak, strip roast, filet of strip, porterhouse steak and hanger steak. Some common cuts from the sirloin area are sirloin steak, center cut sirloin steak, tri-tip steak, tri-tip roast, filet of sirloin, coulotte steak, ball tip steak, ball tip roast and bottom sirloin.

, Loin should be cooked with dry heat. This can be under a broiler, on a grill or in a pan. You want to avoid too much moisture when cooking loin because it may toughen the meat.


The short loin area cooks well with thick and thin cuts of meat and will usually remain tender from rare to well done. The sirloin area will not handle too much heat and will begin to toughen when cooked well done. For sirloin, if cooking well, try thinner cuts and do not overcook. Sirloin also cooks well when marinated prior to cooking.

, The brisket is the breast of the steer. It is a tough cut of meat, but tenderizes with slow cooking. It also contains a high amount of fat. Brisket is usually used for BBQ or deli meat.


Know the subprimal cuts from the brisket. Brisket is usually sold whole and has very few subprimal cuts. A few subprimal cuts you may find are brisket flat or brisket point. The difference between the two being flat cut is a leaner cut of meat and a more flat, uniform cut of meat.
Know the best prepping and cooking methods for brisket. Due to the toughness of brisket, it will benefit from a marinade or dry rub and moist cooking. A marinade can be applied up to 24 hours in advance.
Brisket does well when brined before cooking as well because the salt helps create moisture pockets in the muscle. It also does well when smoked at low temperatures for a long period of time.
Brisket should be cooked at lower temperatures for longer periods of time in order to minimize toughness. Cooking at a high temperature will make the connective tissue and fat tougher in brisket creating a chewy and dry cut of beef. The longer cooking allows the connective tissue and fat to dissolve into the meat giving it the moisture, tenderness and flavor desired.

, Chuck meat comes from the shoulder of the cattle and is highly used. Because of the high use of this muscle, the meat has a lot of connective tissue creating a tough cut. However, chuck comes in many subprimal cuts and can be prepared in many ways that overcome this toughness.


Know the subprimal cuts from the chuck. Chuck is sold ground or as whole muscle. Ground chuck is commonly used for hamburgers and other ground beef products. Some of the more tender cuts of chuck are flat iron steak, petite chuck tender roast and shoulder tender medallions.
The other cuts of chuck tend to be tougher, but still very flavorful. They are top blade steak, chuck roast, cross rib roast, short ribs, stew meat, chuck arm roast, mock tender steak, shoulder clod roast, mock tender roast, ranch steak, sierra cut, under blade steak, country style ribs, chuck eye roast and chuck eye steak.
Know the best prepping and cooking methods for chuck. Ground chuck cooks well grilled or pan fried without any prep work. Chuck roasts benefit the most from moist cooking at low temperatures for longer periods of time. Chuck roasts can be broiled, braised or cooked in a crock pot. The key to a tender and moist roast is low heat for a long period of time in order to dissolve the connective tissue.
Stewing works well for whole muscle cuts of chuck. When cooking with chuck steaks, a marinade or tenderizer will help tenderize the meat and keep it moist for grilling or other shorter cooking methods.
When marinating steaks, marinade for a shorter period of time, usually less than an hour. When choosing a chuck steak, select the thickness based on how you plan to cook it. For short cooking at higher temperatures a thinner steak will work well. For cooking in liquids or for longer periods of time a thicker steak will work well.

, Beef shank is found in front of the brisket and is the forearm of the cattle. This cut of meat contains a high amount of collagen and is used in many recipes that call for a gravy type of sauce.


Know the subprimal cuts from the shank. Shank is usually sold whole with the bone in, but it can be ground for lean beef as well. Sometimes shank can be found in a crosscut with the brisket meat attached.
Know the best prepping and cooking methods for shank. Shank has the best flavor when cooked with the bone in and should be cooked with moist heat. It benefits from long cooking at low heat. The collagen is released during cooking and will create a rich, creamy sauce. Shank is good for making soups and broths.

, The round is found on the back part of the cattle and includes the rump and hind leg. Round tends to be slightly tough due to the high use of the muscle and is considered a lean meat.


Know the subprimal cuts from the round. Round is often sold as ground beef and will be labeled ground round. There are many subprimal roast cuts as well. These include rump roast, top round London broil, bottom round London broil, top round roast, eye of round roast, bottom round roast, sirloin tip roast and sirloin tip center roast.
There are some steak cuts from the round as well. These include round petite tender steaks, top round steaks, bottom round steak, eye of round steak, sirloin tip center steak, sirloin tip side steak and butterfly top round steak.

, Ground round and petite tender steaks can be pan fried or grilled without marinating and turn out tender and flavorful. The roasts can be cooked in various ways. These are with moist heat, such as braising, or with dry heat, such as roasting. When roasting, lower temperatures with longer cooking times will give the roast the best flavor.


The exception to cooking roasts is with London broil. London broil benefits the most from being marinated and grilled. Steaks from the round can be prepared in many ways. They all benefit from a marinade. After marinating, the steaks can be sautéed or grilled.
Another good method for cooking round steaks is braising in a flavorful liquid and marinating is not required. When marinating round it is important that you do not over-marinate. Due to the leanness of the meat, over-marinating will toughen the proteins and give the opposite of the desired effect. When using a marinade, it is best to start with a shorter marinating time, such as 20 minutes at room temperature, and increase the time as needed.

, The short plate is found underneath the ribs near the abdomen area of the cattle. This cut contains some rib bones, cartilage and meat. It is not a lean cut of meat.


Know the subprimal cuts from the short plate. Short ribs and skirt steak are the subprimal cuts from the short plate. The short ribs contain more cartilage than the skirt steak.
Know the best prepping and cooking methods for short plate. For skirt steak and short ribs, removal of the membrane on one side is important before cooking. The membrane does not allow direct heat to penetrate the meat and will become chewy and tough when cooked.
The skirt steak does well when cooked with dry heat, in a pan or on the grill. It needs high heat and searing to develop flavors and should not be cooked to well done. Once it is cooked, slice it across the grain very thin.
Short ribs cook better with moist heat on lower temperatures at a longer time. They have a very full flavor and pair well with high flavor braising liquids, such as dark beer.

, The flank is on the underside of the cattle below the loin. Flank is a tough cut of beef.


Know the subprimal cuts from the flank. The subprimal cuts are flank steak or flap. Flank steak is the most popular cut and can be easily found in most supermarkets.
Know the best prepping and cooking methods for flank. Flank benefits from a marinade, usually no more than an hour. It can then be grilled, broiled or pan seared. Flank also benefits from braising.

, The rib cut comes from the backbone and ribs of the cattle. It generally contains a high amount of marbling and is used to make steaks, roasts and ribs.


Know the subprimal cuts from the rib. The steak cuts are Delmonico steak, filet of rib, cowboy steak, rib steak and ribeye steak. The roast cuts consist of prime ribeye roast and boneless ribeye roast. The cuts containing rib bones are back ribs and short ribs.
Know the best prepping and cooking methods for rib. There is a lot of versatility when cooking cuts of beef from the rib. The backbone area produces the tenderest cuts and the ribs tend to be slightly tougher, but all the cuts are very flavorful.
The steaks should be cooked with dry heat and can be sautéed, broiled or grilled. Depending on the thickness of the cut, they will cook quickly. Steaks from the rib are usually tender even when cooked well done due to the high amount of marbling.
To get the best steak, look for good marbling before purchasing. Roasts from the rib cook well with dry heat. Before cooking the roast, pat it with a towel to remove excess moisture, season and then roast in an oven.
Braising is not usually a good method for cooking a roast from the rib because it can toughen the meat. For the rib cuts braising is usually the best method because they do well with the extra moisture.

, Most grocery stores carry quality beef. There are certain quality indicators to look for when purchasing beef and labeling information can be confusing. In order to avoid confusion it is best to have the cut you would like to purchase in mind before going shopping.

, You want the meat to be cold from the time it left the manufacturing plant to the time you purchase it in order to get the best quality with the least issue of bacterial contamination. If the meat does not feel cold to the touch in the store, you should not purchase it.

, It is best to purchase beef in clear packages so you can evaluate the color. It should be bright red or a purplish-red. There should not be any discolored spots, such as gray or brown. Often grocery stores will put beef on sale when it is close to expiration, so, in order to avoid purchasing lower quality beef, you will need to examine the beef for discoloration.

, The fresher the beef is, the less free moisture there will be in the package. If there is an excess of water in the package, the meat may have been mishandled, stored at incorrect temperatures or close to expiration.

, Beef should be firm, with tougher or larger cuts of meat being more firm than tender or small cuts of beef.

, If the meat looks like it has a rough uneven cut, you probably do not want to purchase it. Beef will cook more evenly when it is cut to the same thickness throughout the piece. If it is uneven, then you may have some parts overcooked or undercooked. When purchasing steaks that need to be cooked well done in a shorter amount of time, a thinner cut is usually best.

, For leaner cuts, such as eye of round or sirloin steak, choose beef with the least amount of marbling and visible fat. If you are cooking a higher fat cut or less tender cut, such as ribeye steak or chuck roast, then marbling and fat are important to the flavor. Marbling should be even throughout the meat without many large fat lines running through the meat. For roasts, having a layer of fat or larger fat lines can be beneficial to the flavor and tenderness after cooking because they will essentially “melt” into the meat.

, The meat should be completely sealed with no holes or exposure to air. Vacuumed sealed beef is a purplish-red color when it is sealed and turns bright red after exposure to oxygen. If you are purchasing vacuum sealed meat and it is bright red before you open it, the package may have been compromised and you may not want to purchase.


It is best to purchase in clear packages because you can see what you are getting. Sometimes ground beef is sold in packaged tubes. The ground beef is still fine to eat, but it may be a higher fat content or lower quality than ground beef in clear vacuumed sealed packages. It is still safe to eat as long as the package has not been compromised in any way. When purchasing beef from a butcher, be sure it is wrapped in sanitary packaging or paper and is sealed completely.

, Having beef that is labeled properly is important to understanding how to handle the beef and if it is right for your application.


Choose meat that is clearly labeled with the primal and subprimal cut information. There are some subprimal cuts from different primal cuts that have the same name. Without knowing the primal cut information you may purchase the wrong subprimal cut of beef.
Know what health claims are and which ones can be used with beef. Beef can be labeled with lean or extra lean health claims. In order to be considered lean, it must have less than 10 g of total fat, less than 4.5 g of saturated fat and less than 95 mg of cholesterol. In order to be considered extra lean, it must have less than 5 g of total fat, less than 2 g of saturated fat and less than 95 mg of cholesterol. Some packages of beef may have the American Heart Association (AH) check mark. This is not a health claim, but an endorsement from the AHA because the benefits of that cut of beef meet AHA heart healthy standards.

, USDA grading is not mandatory, but many companies pay to have the grading done to help consumers understand the difference in beef. Prime is the highest grade and is characterized by high marbling and tenderness. Choice is the next grade and is the most commonly sold grade. It has some marbling and tenderness varies. Select is lowest grade and applies to very lean cuts of beef. The grading system does not determine the overall quality of the meat, just the tenderness and amount of fat content.

, Sell by dates can help you determine quality and how the meat should be stored. If it is close to the sell by date the meat may suffer from being frozen at this point and should probably be cooked with in a day of purchasing. If the meat is not close to the sell by date, then it should freeze well.

, Colder temperatures help hinder bacterial growth. If the meat gets too warm bacteria can grow on the surface and into the muscle tissue. Once bacteria have grown into the muscle tissue cooking may not kill it and it will make a person ill.

, These specifications will help you cook enough to eliminate most risk of salmonella and other food poisoning.

, According to the National Institute of Health, Salmonella may be found more from loin, rib or chuck primal cuts. E.coli may be found more from the sirloin and round areas of the cattle.


When purchasing these cuts of beef it is more important to ensure they were handled and stored properly before purchase and to handle and store them properly at home.

Look for the “100% Whole Grain” Stamp.,
Understand the term ""whole grain."",
Remain skeptical of products that may contain whole grains.,
Avoid products that list parts of the grain as ingredients.",How to Tell if Bread Is 100 Percent Whole Wheat1," In 2005, the Whole Grains Council began to release products that contained a “100% Whole Grain” stamp. The stamp allows consumers to identify whole grain products quickly and reliably. If a product contains this stamp, the consumer can rest assured that the product:


Contains at least a full serving of whole grain per recommended serving size.
Contains only whole wheat.
Products that carry the “Whole Grain” stamp must contain at least half a serving of whole grain per recommended serving size.;
, Whole wheat is just one type of whole grain. While searching for whole wheat bread, you may come across products labeled ""Whole Grain."" These breads may contain whole wheat, a different type of whole grain, or a combination of several whole grains.Read the label to determine if the product is made from 100% Whole Wheat.


A whole grain contains all three parts of the kernel: the bran (outer layers), the germ (part that generates new plant growth), and the endosperm (inner layers).Other types of whole grains include brown rice, oats and or oatmeal, and wheat berries., As grain kernels are processed, parts of the grain are removed. If the label does not include the word “whole” in front of a grain, the entire kernel may not be present in the product. When you shop for whole wheat bread, remain wary of products with the following words on their labels:


Wheat or wheat flour
Semolina (purified endosperm of durum wheat common in pastas and cereals)Durum wheat (dense wheat commonly used in pastas and cereals)Organic flour
Stoneground
Multigrain (this term indicates that the product contains multiple types of whole grains ‘’’and/or’’’refined grains., Throughout the refinement process, the three parts of the wheat kernel are separated. Each part of the kernel is repurposed and sold as its own product. Avoid products that list parts of the kernel on its labels. These terms include:


Enriched flour: when wheat flour is refined into white flour, the bran and germ are stripped away, leaving only the endosperm.
Bran: this is the outer layer of the kernel.
Wheat germ: this is the part of the kernel responsible for new plant growth."

Check if the milk was kept in room temperature for long.,
Microwave a sample.",How to Tell if Milk is Bad," Fresh milk should have no odor at all and must have the usual smell of the milk. The milk starts smelling unpleasantly and tastes tangy if it has gone off.;
, Milk is a thin liquid with a smooth texture. It should not have an inconsistent color, lumps or be yogurt like. Quarantine the milk immediately if it has a thick cottage cheese like appearance.

, Milk should always be a pure clean white. If the milks carton is not transparent, try pouring some into a glass and hold it up to light. Spoiled milk is normally a darker shade such as yellow.

, It is required by law that milk has to have a 'best before' stamped on the packing. Scientists recommend to use milk before 3 days of the 'best before' date.

, Due to different circumstances milk can go off before the use by date. Milk should be stored at 39°F (4°C), but when stored in the freezer it can last the 'best before' date.

, Pour some milk in a microwavable glass and put it in the microwave for a minute. Observe the hot milk and if it has lumps or becomes gooey, throw it out.

Look for products that list whole wheat as the first ingredient.,
Be skeptical of products that list whole wheat second.,
Note the length of the ingredient list.",How to Tell if Bread Is 100 Percent Whole Wheat2," Food companies must list their ingredients in descending order of weight. The most prevalent ingredient is always the first item listed. If you are searching for a 100% whole wheat product, the first ingredient listed should be “Whole Wheat Flour,” “100% Whole Wheat Flour,” or “Wholemeal Flour.” No other type of flour should appear in the ingredient list.


Wheat flour, unbleached wheat flour, multigrain, enriched, and stone-ground wheat flour are alternative ways of saying “refined white flour.”, If whole wheat is the second item on the ingredient list, there is a high chance that whole grains account for a majority of the ingredients. However, this is not always the case. When whole wheat is listed second on the ingredient list, the bread may contain between 1% to 49% of the grain.


When in doubt, always choose a product that lists whole wheat first., The only ingredients required to bake delicious bread are flour, water, yeast, salt, and a pinch of sugar. Bread manufacturers add additional ingredients to their bread to enhance their product’s taste, texture, and shelf-life. If you are trying to purchase less-processed bread, shop for items that have a short ingredient list with identifiable ingredients."
"
Do not buy bread based on its color.,
Do not buy bread based on descriptive words.,
Do not assume that multigrain bread is made with whole grains.",How to Tell if Bread Is 100 Percent Whole Wheat3," A common misconception regarding bread is that the color of the loaf is directly related to the nutritional value of the product—the darker the loaf, the healthier the bread. This is not always the case, however. Always read the ingredient list to determine if a product is truly nutritious and made of whole wheat or if it simply contains artificial coloring agents.


Many dark loaves, such as pumpernickel and rye, are often made with enriched flours and receive their dark hues from molasses or caramel.
White bread is not always unhealthy. Many manufacturers are now producing white breads made from white whole wheat flours., Bread companies use certain phrases to make consumers believe that their product is more nutritious than it truly is. These phrases often include the following words: “country,” “home,” and “harvest.” Since these phrases are not regulated by the FDA, bread companies may deceptively depict the production process.


Don’t let these words prevent you from scanning the ingredient list., Multigrain sounds incredibly nutritious, but the term’s vagueness makes it rather deceptive. A multigrain product does not necessarily contain a variety of whole grains. More often than not, multigrain products only contain refined grains.


Read the ingredient list to determine if a multigrain product contains whole or refined grains."

Use plastic wrap.,
Allow the baked goods to cool to room temperature.,
Wrap the baked goods individually or whole.,
Make sure the baked goods are sealed tight in the wrapping.,
Add ribbon or stickers.,
Write a personal message on the wrapping.,
Use a shipping box if you are planning to mail the baked goods.",How to Wrap Baked Goods," One fun way to wrap your baked goods is to buy cellophane bags at your local craft store or online. You can get clear cellophane for a simple look or go for colored cellophane for a more festive look.If you are wrapping baked goods for Christmas, for example, you may get green and red cellophane bags. Or if you are wrapping baked goods for Easter, you may get pastel colored cellophane bags.
You may opt for cellophane bags in different sizes if you are wrapping baked goods of various sizes, such as different sized cookies, or go for a pack of the same size if you are wrapping baked goods that are the same size.;
, A simple but effective way to wrap baked goods is to use butcher paper or parchment paper. You may wrap the baked goods up in the paper to transport to a friend’s house for dessert or to give as a hostessing gift. Butcher paper is ideal if you are looking for a cheap, easy wrapping for baked goods that are a gift.You can get butcher paper and parchment paper at your local supermarket or online.

, If you are more into paper over plastic, you may go for bags made of wax or brown paper. Wax bags are a good option if you are wrapping small baked goods like cookies as individuals servings. Brown paper bags are also a fun, cheap option for individually wrapped baked goods.You can find wax bags and brown paper bags at your local supermarket or online.

, If you are planning to wrap baked goods that have icing or toppings on them, you may opt for small cardboard boxes that have a lid or a closure on top. Baked goods like cupcakes with icing or cakes with frosting may do better in a wrapping that has some room on top and a solid lid or closure.You can find small cardboard boxes for baked goods at craft stores or online.

, If you are planning to store the baked goods, you may try putting them in glass jars with a tight lid, such as mason jars. Mason jars also make a good gift wrapping for baked goods, especially if the baked goods are small, such as cookies.You can find mason jars at your local craft store or online.

, If you are wrapping the baked goods to preserve them at home, nothing beats plastic wrap. You can also opt for plastic wrap if you are planning to ship the baked goods in the mail, as plastic wrap helps to keep the baked goods fresh.You can find plastic wrap at your local supermarket.

, Before you wrap the baked goods, it is important that you allow them to cool on your kitchen counter. You may use a cooling rack to ensure they cool properly. Allow them to come to room temperature so they no longer give off steam.Wrapping hot, steaming baked goods will cause them to lose their freshness. Be patient and let them come to room temperature before wrapping them up.

, Once the baked goods have come to room temperature, they can be wrapped in your wrapping of choice. Make sure you wrap the baked goods themselves and do not wrap them on a plate or platter. Wrap the baked goods on their own, as this will preserve their freshness.If you are wrapping baked goods like cookies or cupcakes, you may wrap them individually so they are single servings. If you are wrapping a cake, you may wrap it whole so it can then be cut once it is opened.

, Once you have wrapped the baked goods, you should examine the wrapping to make sure it is sealed tightly. If you are using wrapping like a wax bag, a cellophane bag, or butcher paper, you will need to secure the wrapping with tape.Hold up the wrapped baked goods and make sure they do not slide out. Check that the baked goods are covered completely in the wrapping so no air can get in and dry them out.
If you are planning to ship the baked goods, you should bake them and prepare them the day you are planning to mail them. Make sure you wrap each baked good individually and keep the same types of baked goods together so they stay fresh. For example, wrap cookies with cookies and cakes with cakes.

, Once you have wrapped up the baked goods, feel free to get creative and add ribbons or stickers to the wrapping. You may tie the top of the cellophane bags with ribbon, for example, or use colorful string to decorate the butcher paper covering the baked good. Adding these details can make the baked good seem more festive, especially if it is meant to be a gift.You can also put stickers on the baked good for an added touch. You may create your own stickers using a design program on the computer and attach personalized stickers on the baked goods, such as the name of your guests at a party you are hosting. The baked goods could then act as party favors.
You may also opt for stickers or other decorations that fit a theme. For example, if you are giving the baked goods as gifts for Christmas, you may decorate them with Christmas stickers.

, You can also decorate the wrapping by writing a personal message. If the baked goods are meant for someone in particular, you may write a nice message on the wrapping. You could also write the person’s name on the wrapping so they know it is for them.For example, if you are giving the baked goods to your sister for Christmas, you may write, “For the best sister ever, Merry Christmas, Love Always.”

, To ship the wrapped baked goods, place them in a shipping box made of cardboard. Use bubble wrap or packing peanuts on the top and bottom of the shipping box to ensure the baked goods are secure when they are mailed. Make sure everything is packed tightly in the box as you do not want the baked goods to shift or move around in transit.Mark the box “perishable” on the outside so it is clear there is food inside. You should also let the person know you are sending them a package with food so they are home to accept it, as you do not want the package to end up sitting outside for too long.

Consider the shape.,
Check around the stem.,
Do not fixate on the color.,
Note any speckles.,
Choose a sweet smelling mango.,
Avoid a mango with a sour or alcoholic scent.,
Gently squeeze the mango.,
Feel the skin.,
Judge the weight.,
Place the mango in a brown paper bag.,
Sit the mango out at room temperature.,
Move the mango to a refrigerator once ripe.",How to Tell if a Mango Is Ripe," For most mango varieties, a round or football shape is preferable over a flat appearance. That said, there are specific differences between mango varieties worth keeping in mind.








The Ataulfo mango has a somewhat flattened oval shape when ripe. This variety is also usually quite small.
The Francis mango is oblong and has a slight s-shape when ripe.
The Haden mango is round to oval in shape. This variety is usually medium to large in size.
The Keitt mango is a large, oval-shaped variety.
The Kent mango is another large, oval-shaped mango variety.
The Tommy Atkins mango is oval or oblong in shape. As for size, this variety is usually medium to large.
The Alphonse mango has an oblong shape.
The Edward mango can have both round and oblong shapes.
The Kesar mango usually has a round shape.
The Manila mango has a notably skinny, slender appearance.
The Palmer mango has an oblong appearance.;
, The flesh and skin around the stem should be especially plump and especially round.








Before a mango ripens, the stem end will be fairly flat. The pulp, juices, and sugars inside the fruit have not yet developed completely. Once the mango finishes developing and turns ripe, it should be so plump inside that the stem end rises slightly instead of remaining flat.

, A red hue is often and indication of how much sun exposure a mango has received, not an indication of freshness. Moreover, the color of a ripe mango varies based on the mango variety. You should never rely only on color to determine if a mango is ripe, but if you want to use color as a backup indicator, you must first understand how certain varieties are supposed to look once ripe.









The Ataulfo mango turns a deep, golden color when ripe.
The Francis mango will be a blend of green and gold when ripe. The green tint of the yellow skin fades, gradually turning more gold. Note that some green will still remain, however.
The Haden mango turns from green to yellow once ripe. This variety is more prone to reddening, as well, but it does not need to be red in order to be ripe.
The Keitt mango will remain green even once it becomes ripe.
The Kent mango will remain mostly dark green, but it often has yellow undertones or yellow dots over various portions of the mango once it ripens.
The Tommy Atkins mango provides little to no visual clues. The skin can remain yellow-green, turn golden, or develop a dark red blush.
The Alphonse mango has a purple to yellow skin once ripe.
The Edward mango has skin that can be pink, yellow, or some blend of the two.
The Kesar mango can remain green once ripe, but they often take on a yellow hue.
The Manila mango usually has an orange-yellow hue when ripe, but occasionally, the skin can also turn pink.
The Palmer mango can vary in color, often appearing purple, red, yellow, or some mix of the three.

, While this is not always a sure indication, either, if the peel of a mango has developed a few brown spots or speckles, it is likely ripe.









A mango lacking speckles may still be ripe, though, especially depending on the variety. Spots should not be relied on as your only indicator.
Some mango varieties, like the Kent mango, can develop yellow spots instead of brown spots.

, Give the mango a good whiff right around the stem area. If the fruit has a strong fruity, sweet smell, there is a good chance that it has fully ripened.









Sniff the mango near the stem end. The odor will be strongest there, and you will get a more accurate idea of how the fruit actually smells.
The smell should remind you of the way a mango tastes. The senses of taste and smell are closely linked, and the way something smells greatly impacts the way it tastes., If you sniff the mango near its stem and smell a strong bitter smell, this is a sign that the mango has over-ripened and is starting to rot.









The mango has a very high sugar content when compared with many other fruits. As they start to go bad, these fruits will actually begin to naturally ferment. This explains the sour, alcohol-tinted smell. It also means, though, that the mango has over-ripened far too much. It will likely taste as sour as it smells.

, When you apply light pressure to the sides of the mango, you should feel the flesh “give” a little or indent. A soft mango is a ripe mango.








A mango that does not cave to pressure or one that feels hard as a rock is nowhere near ripe enough to eat.
Understand, of course, that the mango should not be squishy. If your fingers pierce the mango when you apply a small amount of pressure, the fruit is overripe.
To avoid accidentally bruising the fruit, press with your palm instead of your fingertips. Hold the mango in the palm of your hand. Close your hand around the fruit, pressing on it with the ball of your palm.

, Lightly rub your fingertips over the surface of the mango. Oftentimes, a ripe mango will have a few wrinkles somewhere on the skin.








Note, however, that the absence of wrinkles does not necessarily signify that the mango is unripe.
If deep wrinkles cover a large portion of the surface, the mango is likely overripe.
The Ataulfo mango is especially well-known for developing wrinkles as it ripens. Other varieties may develop light wrinkles that are difficult to detect, while others could potentially stay smooth even after they ripen.

, Pick up the mango and feel its heft in your hand. A ripe mango will feel somewhat heavy for its size and will feel heavier than an unripe mango does.









If you need a better weight guideline, compare the weight of a potentially ripe mango with a mango you know is unripe. The unripe mango should feel notably lighter than the other mango if that other mango is ripe, especially if the mangoes are similar in size and of the same variety. If the two feel too similar in weight, the second mango is probably unripe, as well.

, While this is not strictly necessary, putting the fruit inside of a bag will help speed up the ripening process.








Fruit naturally produces ethylene gas as it ripens. The presence of ethylene hormone will trigger further ripening, and the brown paper bag traps ethylene produced by the ripening mango.
Placing an apple or banana in the bag along with the mango can speed the process up even further since these two fruits are known to produce high levels of ethylene.

, Check the mango each day, using the methods mentioned here, to determine if it has ripened yet.









This can take anywhere from 2 to 7 days, depending on how unripe the mango is when you start.
Do not store an unripe mango in the refrigerator. Cold temperatures dramatically slow the ripening process, and an unripe mango will likely go bad in the refrigerator before it has a chance to ripen.

, A ripe mango must be eaten immediately or stored in the refrigerator for up to five days.









The cold temperatures that are the natural enemy of an unripe mango are the best friend of a ripe mango. If you leave a ripe mango on the counter at room temperature, it will go bad within the day. In a cold refrigerator, though, it can usually stay ripe and fresh for at least four days, if not five.

To check for freshness of raw eggs at home, place the questionable egg in a pot of cold water.,
A fresh egg out of its shell will have a thick white that doesn't spread out too much, and a yolk that is firm and holds its shape.

",How to Tell if Your Eggs Are Fresh," Check the eggs by opening the carton. If some are broken, do not buy the carton.;
, Store them in the grocery carton in the coldest part of the refrigerator and not in the door.

, Break them into a clean container, cover tightly, and keep refrigerated for use within 2 days.

, Hard-cooked eggs will keep refrigerated for 1 week. Use leftover yolks and whites within 4 days. Don't keep eggs, including Easter eggs out of the refrigerator more than 2 hours.

, Heat the egg-milk mixture gently. Use a food thermometer to check the temperature or use a metal spoon (the mixture should coat the spoon). If in-shell pasteurized eggs are available, they can be used safely in recipes that won’t be cooked.

, AA eggs have a higher quality and longer shelf life. Make sure they've been refrigerated in the store. Any bacteria present in an egg can multiply quickly at room temperature.

, Use within 3 to 4 days. Cook egg dishes such as quiche and casseroles to 160 °F (71 °C) as measured with a food thermometer.

, If the egg sinks to the bottom and lays down, it is fresh. If it sinks and stands up on the bottom of the pan, it is not very fresh, but still safe to eat. If the egg floats on the surface, it should be thrown out.

Recognize mature fruit by color.,
Inspect the skin’s texture.,
Inspect for damage.",How to Tell if a Passion Fruit Is Ripe1," Avoid green passion fruit. Remember: the greener it is, the less ripened it is. This holds true for all varieties. Spot ripening fruit by changes in color. Look for fruit that has turned purple, red, and/or yellow.Expect some to be a uniform shade and others to be a mix between colors.Some fruit may actually ripen without changing color that much. If you’re growing your own and find green fruit that has fallen from the tree, judge it by other methods before discarding.;
, Spot unripened fruit by its smooth skin. Recognize ripe fruit by its wrinkles and dimples. Favor moderately wrinkled fruit over excessively wrinkled. Expect very wrinkled fruit to have already passed the peak of freshness., Expect to find small cuts and spots, which is normal and generally okay on their own.Bruised fruit is also perfectly edible, just softer. However, do check bruised areas for any cuts through the skin, since the bruised fruit underneath is more at-risk to mold.Bruised or moldy portions can be trimmed from the rest.
Mold that appears on the outside of intact skin can be washed away since you aren't eating the skin."
"
Let growing fruit fall on their own.,
Choose heavy fruit.,
Select firm fruit.",How to Tell if a Passion Fruit Is Ripe2," If you are selecting fruit directly from a tree, don’t pick them. Let gravity do the work. Expect ripe fruit to fall on their own due to their increased weight.However, unripened fruit may also fall due to weather or if the tree is weak from dehydration. Double-check its ripeness by other methods before eating.

, Weigh it in your hand. Recognize immature fruit by its lightness.Favor those that feel heavier than you would expect based on their size.A mature passion fruit should be between four and eight centimeters in diameter and weigh between 1.2 and 1.8 ounces (35 and 50 g)., Give the fruit a very gentle squeeze. The skin should give a little when pressed, but still feel firm.If it feels rock-hard fruit, consider it unripened.If it feels soft, it has passed its peak."

Cut it open.,
Store opened fruit in the fridge or freezer.",How to Tell if a Passion Fruit Is Ripe3," If you have fruit that is almost but not quite there yet, give it a few days to ripen further. Leave it sitting out at room temperature, away from direct sunlight.Inspect it daily so you can enjoy before it becomes too wrinkly, at which point it starts to dry out inside., Do not eat the skin. Use a knife to cut open it. To eat it as is, slice off the top and use a spoon as though you were eating from a bowl.To add it as an ingredient to another dish, slice it in half so you can spoon it out more easily., Once you have cut it open, refrigerate or freeze your fruit to keep it from spoiling. Expect refrigerated fruit to last a week at most. For longer storage, seal it in a high-quality freezer bag and freeze it, which will preserve it up to twelve months."

Lock the bag into the sealer and press the vacuum seal button.,
Seal bags that contain liquid manually.",How to Vacuum Seal1," You’ll better preserve their flavor and nutritional value if you blanch your veggies before packing and freezing them. Place veggies in a large pot of boiling water, cover them, and heat them for three to four minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer them from the pot to a bowl of ice water.Pat the vegetables dry after their ice bath.;
,  If you’re vacuum sealing a piece of meat without seasoning it, just pat it dry with a paper towel before placing it into the vacuum bag. If you prefer, before packing up your meat, you can infuse it with flavor by mixing seasonings or a marinade.For example, pack up a piece of salmon with salt, pepper, dill, and a slice of lemon.

, When you’ve prepared your food for packing, place it into a vacuum bag large enough to fit the item with some room to spare. Fold the edges of the bag’s opening over so your food doesn’t make a mess as you place it into the bag.Make sure there's one to two inches (three to five centimeters) between the food item and side of the bag that you're sealing. That way, you'll have room to lock the sealer's lid over the bag's opening.
Some vacuum seal bags have a maximum fill line, so check your product for a line near its opening.

, You can make vacuum bags by placing two equally sized plastic sheets on top of each other. Place one side of the plastic sheets into the vacuum sealer and press the Seal Only button to heat seal the sheets’ edges together. Repeat the process to create heat seals on three sides, leaving one side open for you to pack the item you want to vacuum seal., Open the sealer lid, position the bag’s opening at the vacuum mouth, then close the sealer lid and listen for a click that indicates it’s locked.Once it’s locked, press the Vacuum Seal button to activate the appliance and compress the bag.Sealers usually have one button to vacuum and automatically seal and another just for sealing. Check your user manual for specific information about how your device’s controls are labeled.

, To seal bags with liquid, watch the bag after you’ve pressed Vacuum Seal. Press the Seal Only button when you start to see liquid move up the bag. After sucking out the last bit of air, the vacuum will start pulling the liquid out, so you should use the Seal Only option to manually seal the bag.To pack items without liquid, you can just press the Vacuum Seal button and let the device seal your bag automatically.

Pour a glass of wine.",How to Serve Foie Gras," Make sure that the foie gras you buy is pre-cooked and ready-to-serve. Only purchase raw foie gras if you have a recipe that calls for it.


There are two basic types of foie gras: duck and goose. Duck is richer and more rustic, while goose is creamier and more delicate. Duck is also smaller than goose. Both duck and goose can be consumed cold or at room temperature, but when served warm, duck tends to be the preferred choice among most chefs.Foie gras usually comes packaged in four different forms: cru (raw), frais (fresh), mi-cuit ou en semi-conserve (partially cooked), and en conserve (shelf-stable).

The raw form should only be used when you need it for a recipe that requires cooking the dish.
Fresh, partially cooked, and shelf-stable types are all ready-to-eat, but partially cooked and shelf-stable fois gras are typically the most preferred types.

;
, Warmth causes the texture to become smoother and the taste to become fuller, but most people find foie gras too overwhelming when served hot. As a result, it is usually stored at room temperature or slightly chilled.


For best results, put the preserved foie gras in the refrigerator 24 hours before you intend to serve it. Take it out of the refrigerator 15 to 45 minutes before serving and let it sit on your counter until it reaches your desired temperature.Remove the packaging after you take it out of the refrigerator.
Serving the foie gras any colder than this can mask the taste and texture too severely.

, Since the flavor is so rich, each slice should only be about 2/5 inch (1 cm) thick.


The average serving is 1.7 to 2.5 oz (50 to 70 g) when served as a starter or 3.5 to 5.3 oz (100 to 150 g) when prepared as a main course.Wait until the foie gras drops in temperature before cutting it. Cold foie gras tends to break apart unevenly.
To make the cutting process as smooth and exact as possible, select a thin, sharp knife with no serrations. Run the knife under very hot water and dry it off with a clean towel before cutting each slice. Wipe the knife clean in between slices.
Only cut the foie gras immediately before you serve it to prevent the dish from oxidizing and dropping in flavor quality.
Note that this information only applies if you are serving a torchon foie gras and not a terrine foie gras. Torchon comes in the shape of a log or loaf and must be sliced. Terrine comes pre-cooked in a terrine mold and should be served directly, still in its mold., Transfer each slice of foie gras to a pre-chilled serving plate. You can either eat the foie gras by itself or pair it with an accompaniment.


Typically, you should serve the slice whole and enjoy it by breaking off pieces with a fork or spoon. The foie gras should be allowed to melt in your mouth. This is true regardless of whether or not you prepare any accompaniments.
Most prefer to serve foie gras with an accompaniment since the flavor of the dish can be overwhelming on its own.
Terrine does not need to be plated separately. It should be eaten from the mold with a warm spoon.

, If you're serving the foie gras as part of a larger meal, serve it before the main course. At this point, the palate is still fairly fresh and can appreciate the dense flavor of foie gras more completely.


If you are serving both goose and duck foie gras, start with the goose before serving the duck. The fuller flavor of the duck can overpower the taste of the goose if served first.

, Brown or white bread is the best option. Cut the bread into triangles before plating it, then place the foie gras on top of the bread or beside it.


Do not spread the foie gras over the bread like a preserve. Your guests can do so if they please, but as a rule, it should be served as a whole slice.
There are two standard bread options: hot toast and thin country bread.
Hot toast is standard sandwich bread. Toast it lightly so that it is only a little brown, but still soft.
Country-style bread should be sliced thinly and toasted very lightly. Some prefer not to toast country bread at all.

, These flavors can cut through the sweet, rich taste of foie gras. The result is a balanced palette that hits a range of flavor notes.


Sweet-and-sour items are among the best options. Try a cranberry jelly or Asian-inspired chutney. Orange sauces and other citrus-based sauces can also work well.
Consider serving it with dried fruit, like figs and prunes. Stone fruit, or fruit with a pit in it—peaches, plums, nectarines, and sour cherries—also work well.Sauces and jams made from these fruits can be spread beneath the foie gras or drizzled on top of it.
On the acidic side, consider serving the dish with a liquor-based sauce, like a caramel mixed with cognac or sherry.

, Many people enjoy the taste of foie gras when it is served alongside a glass of sweet dessert wine. Common options include Sauternes and Riesling.


Additional options include Juraçon, Monbazillac, Bergerac, and Gewurtztraimer (or other Alsatian wines). You may even wish to try it alongside a port wine.Ask your guests before serving them wine with the foie gras. Some people enjoy the combination, while others may think that the wine distracts from the taste of the dish.

Pack your items into a storage bag without overfilling it.,
Use the zip slider to seal the bag.,
Open the valve and place your vacuum hose over it.,
Close the valve cap after you’ve finished vacuuming it.",How to Vacuum Seal2," Note the maximum fill line on your vacuum seal storage bags, and avoid overfilling them to keep them in the best shape. Your packed items should be dry, and you should avoid vacuum sealing objects with sharp corners or hard ridges., After filling your storage bag, take the zip slider firmly between your thumb and index finger. Run it down the length of the bag’s opening at least twice. Then check the ziplock seal with your fingers to ensure the bag is correctly sealed., After sealing the bag, locate the valve and remove the top cap.Place your vacuum hose directly over the valve. Turn the vacuum on, and watch as it starts to suck the air out of the storage bag., Once you’ve vacuumed out as much air as possible, your clothing, blankets, or other sealed item should have reduced in size by about half. Pop the cap back over the valve, put the vacuum away, and store your vacuum sealed bag in a safe place.Avoid storing a bag in a hot place or just throwing it in the closet. It might get damaged in high temperatures or if it accidentally hits a sharp object.

Use a straw to suck out air from a storage bag.,
Try submerging a storage bag in water to flush out air.,
Use the double bag method to vacuum seal.",How to Vacuum Seal3," Place the item you’re storing in a ziplock bag, then put a straw into the bag. Seal the bag, leaving only room for the straw to protrude from the opening, then suck the air out of the bag through the straw. When the plastic squeezes around the item you’re storing, quickly pull the straw out of the bag and seal it completely., Place the item you want to store in a ziplock bag, and seal the bag up to about an inch (two or three centimeters) from one edge. Submerge the bag in a large pot of water until only the unsealed corner sticks out of the water. Pinch the corner closed when the water forces most of the air from the ziplock bag.The pressure from the water will force air out of the plastic bag. It’s not as tight as a vacuum seal, but it’s an easy way to remove air before freezing food.

, Place the item you want to store in a ziplock bag, close the ziplock seal, but leave a corner of the bag unsealed. Place that bag into a larger ziplock bag. Insert a vacuum hose into the larger bag, then seal the larger bag around the vacuum hose.Turn the vacuum on to suck out air from the bags. When it seems like all the air’s been sucked out of the inner bag, finish closing the corner of its ziplock seal you left open. Turn the vacuum off, open the larger bag, and take out the inner bag, which should be effectively vacuum sealed.
You can set aside the outer bag for future use. You only needed it to lock around the vacuum hose and suck air out of the inner bag.

, Tofu is particularly susceptible to bacteria. Therefore, an airtight container is important to store tofu. Do not simply store tofu in a bowl or on a plate and cover it in plastic wrap.For best results, use a Tupperware container with a sealable lid.
You can use a Ziplock bag as well, if you don't have a Tupperware container.

, Tofu will not keep properly without moisture. If you don't want tofu to dry out or go bad, pour water over the container.Pour in enough water that the tofu is just covered.
For best results, use filtered water. Tap water may have contaminants that can harm tofu.
Make sure to change the water daily.

, If you've already prepared the tofu for a dish, there is no need to add water. Tofu that has been flavored and cooked can be stored in an airtight container and then placed in the fridge., If you bought too many packages of tofu, you can store an entire unopened package in the freezer. You do not need to do anything special to store the tofu. Simply place the unopened package in the freezer. When you're ready to use the tofu, you can defrost it and cook as you normally would.Keep in mind, defrosted tofu has a slightly different taste. Its texture changes. It will become chewier and spongier, but some people actually prefer this texture.

, If you've already opened the tofu, you can still store it in the freezer. Drain any excess moisture out of the tofu. Then, place the tofu in a freezer bag or a plastic bag. Set it in your freezer and defrost it when you're ready to use., Tofu takes awhile to defrost, so plan ahead. If you need tofu for a recipe, it will take two days to defrost.

Gently squeeze the tofu, using paper towels or something similar, to remove any excess water.If you need to drain a lot of tofu, place the tofu between two plates. Then, place a heavy can on top of the plates.

, Tofu can be safely refrigerated for about 3 to 5 days in the fridge. Keep track of when you got your tofu. Do not eat it if it's been sitting in the fridge for more than 5 days.If you're unsure when you bought your tofu, check the expiration date. This should give you an idea as to whether the tofu is still safe to eat.

, Tofu can be stored for 3 to 5 months in the freezer safely. As it may be hard to remember exactly when you froze tofu, write down the date on the plastic or freezer wrap. This way, you'll be able to tell if the tofu has been in the freezer for more than 5 months., Make sure you recognize when tofu has gone bad. Bad tofu will become darker. It will go from white to beige. It will also develop a sour smell and a sour taste.Keep in mind, tofu takes on a more beige color when frozen. If your frozen tofu turns brownish, it should still be good to eat if it hasn't been in the freezer for more than four months.

Do not wash the strawberries if you're storing them in the fridge.,
Remove any moldy strawberries immediately.,
Store the strawberries at room temperature if you'll eat them in a few hours.,
Don't store the strawberries in the plastic containers they came in.",How to Store Strawberries1," Strawberries are like sponges that soak up every bit of moisture, and the more water they soak up, the more quickly they'll spoil. If you wash the strawberries and then put them in the fridge, then they'll spoil much more quickly no matter what methods you use. You can wash them if you plan to store them in the freezer, but take care to get rid of excess moisture or they'll get too icy.






;
, Mold spreads easily, so you should remove any moldy strawberries as soon as you buy them. If you store the fresh strawberries with the moldy ones, the mold will spread and they'll spoil quickly. One bad strawberry can spoil the whole batch. You can try to avoid this problem at the store by picking the freshest, brightest strawberries you see.









Place the strawberries on a clean surface and sort through them to find the moldy ones. Avoid touching them too much.

, If you're planning to use the strawberries for a recipe in a few hours, or if you know you'll be eating them as a snack by the evening, you can store them at room temperature to retain their fresh taste.








, Though most store-bought strawberries are packaged in these containers, they aren't ideal for storage. Tupperware is far more durable. The plastic containers won't let in any air and will make the strawberries spoil faster.

Buy baking pans according to the quantity that you will need.,
Consider the various materials used in baking pans.,
Think about a need for any specialty pans.,
Evaluate baking pans for durability.",How to Select Baking Pans," One of the big factors in how well baking pans will work is size. Different recipes call for different sizes of baking pans. This factor can be particularly important for baked goods that are baked in loaves, cakes or any single, whole shape.


Check the size of your oven to make sure that the baking pans you select will fit inside.
Look at your recipes to see what sizes of baking pans are called for, i.e. 9 x 13 inches, etc. Having the specific size will save you from complicated recipe alterations if you need to make sure that your preparations will fit the pan.;
, Another factor in choosing baking pans is getting enough of a particular size for a planned baking regimen. If you will plan to prepare more than one loaf, cake, etc. at a time, multiple baking pans will be necessary.


Evaluate the raw foods that you will buy. For many cooks, baking more than one of something is a way to effectively use a supply of eggs, milk or other perishables. Think about how much you will buy and how much you want to use to choose the right set of baking pans.

, Some Teflon and other nonstick pans may not be made for baking. Using improperly coated baking pans can be dangerous. The general rule of thumb is to stay away from nonstick pans and choose simple, metal baking pans.

, From muffins and cupcakes to specifically-shaped cakes and cookies, some specialized baking pans offer themed results or complex products. If these are a part of your recipe planning, pick up specialty pans that will work.

, The best baking pans are made of sturdy metals that will stand up to pressure without bending. Select an appropriate thickness for baking pans that will work well over time.

While hot, spread the bread with butter. The butter will melt and soak into the slice.;
, Irish soda bread is usually served in slices. Cut the bread into reasonable portions. For example, if you used a large circular pan to make your bread, you may need to cut the loaf in half before cutting slices. Otherwise, the pieces will be large and unwieldy.


Make sure each slice is about a quarter inch thick to avoid crumbling the bread.

, If you’re serving this bread with a meal, place the loaf on the table. Your diners can serve themselves as many pieces as they’d like. Serve the bread on a bread boat, a bread plate, or in a bread basket. Add a white linen doily to the basket to help keep the bread warm.Either slice the bread in advance or provide a bread knife so that guests can cut their own slices.
If your loaf is crumbly, give your guests small bread plates for their soda bread slices. This will help keep your table clean.

, After you and your guests have finished eating, store the bread in an airtight container. You can plastic wrap the bread onto a dish, place the bread in a re-sealable bag, or store it in a bread box. If you don’t store the bread in an airtight container it will quickly become stale.

If harvesting the sweet potatoes yourself, use a spade fork to dig 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) beneath the soil in order to get all the roots up. Handle them carefully since sweet potatoes tend to bruise easily, and shake off excess dirt but do not wash the roots.;
, Keep the roots in a room or other location that reaches between 75 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (24 and 27 degrees Celsius) with relative humidity of 90 to 95 percent.The sweet potatoes need to cure for at least 7 days, but they can be kept there for as many as 14 days.
The curing process creates a second skin that forms over scratches and bruises, allowing the sweet potatoes to last longer in storage.
Use a small electric fan in the area to keep the air circulating. This helps to prevent rotting and molding.
Monitor the temperature and humidity regularly to make sure that the sweet potatoes are sitting in the conditions needed for proper curing.
For best results, keep the sweet potatoes from touching each other as they cure.

, After the sweet potatoes have finished curing, throw away any that appear bruised, rotting, or moldy.


Bruised sweet potatoes have not cured correctly, so they will not last as long as the other sweet potatoes and may even cause the other sweet potatoes to spoil faster.

, Individually wrap the sweet potatoes in sheets of newsprint or in brown paper bags.


Newspaper and brown paper bags are both fairly breathable, providing just enough air circulation to prevent the sweet potatoes from rotting too quickly.

, Store the individually-wrapped sweet potatoes in a cardboard box, wooden box, or wooden basket.


Do not use an airtight storage container.
Place an apple in the box.The apple will help prevent the sweet potatoes from budding.

, Keep the sweet potatoes in an area that is consistently between 55 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (13 and 16 degrees Celsius).For best results, store the sweet potatoes in a basement or root cellar. If neither option is available to you, store them in a dark, cool, and well-ventilated cupboard or pantry away from strong heat sources.Do not use a refrigerator.
Monitor the temperature frequently to make sure that it does not fall below or rise above this range.
Stored in this manner, the sweet potatoes can last up to 6 months. Remove them from storage gently to prevent bruising.

Sort your potatoes.,
Store healthy potatoes in a dark, dry place.,
Keep the temperature cool.,
Check your potatoes periodically for signs of spoilage.,
Cure your potatoes for long-term storage.",How to Store Potatoes1," After buying a bunch of potatoes or gathering them from your garden, take a few moments to sift through them. Look for any potatoes with broken skins, bruises, or any other visible damage. These shouldn't be stored — they will rot faster than normal and may spread the rot to undamaged potatoes. Instead, choose one of the following options:


Use the damaged potatoes within a day or two, cutting out any damaged or unattractive parts before use.
""Cure"" the potatoes to reverse damage and extend their storage life (see curing step below).
Throw badly-damaged or rotting potatoes out.;
, Once you've separated the damaged potatoes from the undamaged ones, put the latter in a spot that's not exposed to light or moisture. These things can cause greening and/or rotting. Good examples include basements, cellars, and out-of-the-way kitchen cabinets.


Additionally, you'll want your potatoes to stay well-ventilated. Most potatoes are sold in mesh bags that allow air to pass through — these are fine. Don't transfer the potatoes to an airtight container.
If you picked the potatoes yourself, try layering them in wicker baskets or ventilated boxes. Add a page of newspaper between each layer. Cover the top layer with newspaper as well.

, Potatoes keep best at temperatures less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius).For maximum storage length, potatoes should remain between 35-40 degrees Fahrenheit (about 2-4 degrees Celsius). A cool, dark room like a basement or root cellar usually works well.


Note that refrigerators are too cold for potatoes and can ruin their taste. See the section below for more information., Stored using the method above, most potatoes will last a few months without problems. However, every few weeks it is wise to check your potatoes briefly for ""problem"" signs. One rotten potato can infect the others around it, so getting rid of bad potatoes before they have a chance to spread is vital. Symptoms to look for include:



Greening: The potato gains a subtle green color. Over time, the flesh will soften and appear slightly withered. Often caused by exposure to light. If there is only slight greening, cut away the green portions of the skin before cooking.Sprouting: Small bud-like ""sprouts"" start to grow out of the potato. Usually accompanied by greening/softening. Cut the sprouts away before cooking if the potato isn't too soft or green.

Rot: The potato appears to be visibly decaying — it may smell bad, have a soft texture, and/or be covered with mold. Throw out rotting potatoes and replace any paper that was touching them.

, If you want your potatoes to last even longer, try the technique described below. This is also a good choice for potatoes with minor damage that would otherwise be vulnerable to rot — ""cured"" potatoes will usually have minor cuts and bruises heal up. To cure your potatoes:


Lay your potatoes on a bed of newspaper in a cool, dark place.
Raise the temperature to 50-60 degrees Fahrenheit (10-15 degrees Celsius), slightly higher than normal for storage.
Let the potatoes sit this way undisturbed. After about two weeks, the potato skins will be thickened and dry. Brush off any large clumps of dirt from the surface of the potato and store them according to the directions above (this will require you to lower the temperature slightly).

Store late-season onions.,
Store pungent onions.,
Dry the onion skins.,
Trim the onions.,
Choose a cool, dark place to store your onions.,
Keep the storage space dry.,
Make sure the space is well ventilated.,
Try storing your onions in pantyhose.,
Use thick-necked bulbs first.,
Inspect stored onions regularly.,
Store peeled onions in the freezer.,
Wrap leftover onions and store them in the refrigerator.",How to Store Onions," The onions you harvest in the spring and summer are not hardy enough to store. They should be eaten within a few weeks of harvesting. Plan to store onions that are harvested in the fall, since these varieties are able to last through the winter.


If you grow your own onions, plan to store onions that you plant during the spring.
Onions are ready to harvest for storage in the late summer or early fall, when the top of the plant begins to fall over and dry up.;
, Pungent onions, as opposed to mild onions, have sulfurous compounds that cause you to tear up when you chop them and also help preserve the onions through the winter. Mild onions don't have this self-preservation system, so they should be eaten a few weeks after they're harvested. The following varieties of globe onions do well in long-term storage:


Yellow onions such as ebenezer, yellow globe, downing yellow globe, and yellow globe danvers.
White onions such as Southport white globes. These should only be stored if their necks are small.
Red onions including wethersfield and Southport red globe.

, After the onions are harvested, spread them out in a ventilated area so that the skins can harden. Do not remove the leaves. Allow the onions to cure for two to four weeks.


Dry the onions in an area away from sunlight and humidity. Sunlight can taint the taste of the onions and make them bitter. Lay a tarp in your garage or a shed. The environment should be dry, warm and breezy.
The onions are finished curing when their stems are no longer green. The onions' skin should be withered around the stem and wrapped tightly around the onions.

, Once the stems are completely dry, use sharp scissors or a knife to trim the roots from the onions.


Discard onions that still have green stems at this point, as well as those that are bruised or have broken paper.
Cut the leaves at least an inch above the bulb, or leave them intact and braid the leaves together.

, The space should have a temperature maintained between 40 to 50° Fahrenheit, or 4 to 10° Celsius. Many people opt to store their onions in a root cellar or basement. If the space is too warm, your onions will begin to sprout. If the location you chose is too cold, the onions will start to rot.

, Onions easily absorb moisture, and the wetness in the air will rot your produce. The humidity level should be kept at 65 to 70 percent.

, Keeping air flowing around the onions will help prevent molding and rotting.


For good ventilation, hang the onions in mesh baskets, netted bags or pantyhose.
If you decide to use pantyhose as a storage option, tie a knot between each bulb. Use the bulbs from the bottom, cutting the onion out below the knot so the onion above it stays secure. You can also use string or twist ties in between the onions to keep them separate.

, Yes, you heard right — pantyhose. Tie off the bottom of the pantyhose, introduce an onion into the sleeve, and tie off the pantyhose again just above the onion. Introduce the next onion into the sleeve and repeat until the pantyhose sleeve is tied off with as many onions as it can fit.


Storing onions in this way allows them to breathe properly. Any moisture they may have already come in contact with will soon evaporate, giving your angiosperms a longer shelf life.

, The thick-necked bulbs are the oldest and will not last as long as the younger, smaller onions.

, Take a moment every now and then to browse over your onions. Throw out any that have started to rot.


You can still eat onions that have started to sprout. Just chop away the green part before using them in a recipe.
If an onion is slimy or discolored, don't risk eating it.
Save extra bulbs to plant in the spring.

, Chop your onions and place them in a flat layer on a cookie sheet and freeze. After they are frozen, remove the onions from the sheet and store them in Ziploc bags or storage containers in the freezer. One of the down sides of this option is limited storage space.

, When cooking, partial onions often remain from preparing the meal. To properly store these remnants for use later, wrap the onion in plastic and place in the vegetable drawer in the refrigerator.

Eat Irish soda bread with butter.,
Serve the bread with citrus marmalades.,
Serve a slice with a stew.,
Make a sandwich.",How to Serve Irish Soda Bread2," This method of serving is a timeless classic. Slice the loaf of bread while it’s still hot. Next, spread on a thick layer of room-temperature butter. If the butter is unsalted, sprinkle on a pinch of salt to bring out the creamy flavors.Mash room-temperature butter with freshly cut herbs to create an aromatic herbal butter.

, Irish soda bread has a hearty flavor that pairs wonderfully with sweet or bitter citrus marmalades. You can either make your own marmalade or buy some in the jam section of your favorite grocery store.


If your loaf isn’t fresh out of the oven, toast the Irish soda bread before adding the marmalade.

, The thick and hearty nature of Irish soda bread helps it pair very well with meaty stews. You can use it to soak up the juices as you eat or as a vehicle for the meat and vegetables. Traditionally, Irish soda bread is served with a slow-simmered beef and barley stew.You can make your own beef and barley stew or buy it ready-made at a gourmet grocery store.

, Irish soda bread has a very mild flavor that can pair well with any kind of sandwich filling. Add Swiss cheese, corned beef, and sauerkraut for a classic savory sandwich combination. If you want to get creative, spread some apple butter on slices of toasted Irish soda bread and top them with freshly fried bacon.


Soda bread is notoriously crumbly. Toast the slices before arranging the sandwich to help keep the bread together.
Any kind of cheese will go with Irish soda bread, but blue cheese is especially good."

Gather your ingredients.,
Prepare your workspace.,
Combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl.,
Incorporate the buttermilk.,
Transfer the batter to the cake pan or cast-iron skillet.,
Bake the bread for thirty to forty five minutes.,
Let the bread cool.",How to Serve Irish Soda Bread3," There are many different Irish soda bread recipes that call for additions such as raisins or sugar. However, traditional Irish soda bread only has four ingredients: 4 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 14 ounces of buttermilk.If you want to make brown Irish soda bread, substitute three of the cups of white flour with whole wheat flour.
Buttermilk can be found in the dairy section of your local grocery store.

, Preheat your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius) for about ten minutes. While you wait, grease and flour a nine-inch circular cake pan and set it aside. Alternatively, use a cast-iron skillet for a more traditional touch. The skillet should be pre-seasoned and doesn’t need to be greased and floured.


To grease and flour a cake pan, first coat the inside of the pan with butter. Next, sift over a small amount of flour until all of the butter is coated. Discard any excess flour.

, Sift the flour while adding it to remove any lumps. Make sure these ingredients are very well combined by whisking them together. If they’re not, you risk having unsavory pockets of baking soda all through your bread.

, Add the buttermilk all at once and fold it into the dry ingredients with a spatula. Stir until the ingredients are just combined. If you mix it a lot, you will have a smooth crust. If you mix until just combined, your crust will have the traditional rough texture.Don’t use an electric mixer to incorporate the buttermilk. The mixer will overmix the batter and your bread won’t rise very well.

, Once all of the batter is in the pan, tap the pan on the counter to release any trapped air bubbles. Next, cut an “x” shape in the batter with a sharp knife for a traditional Irish soda bread look., Place your soda bread in the center of a hot oven and bake it for about thirty minutes. Check the loaf periodically after the thirty minute mark to see if it’s ready. The crust should be firm to the touch, and if you insert a toothpick into the center of the loaf it should come out clean.If you use a cast-iron skillet instead of a cake pan, your bread will need more time to cook.

, Remove the bread from the oven when it’s done cooking and transfer it to a wire baking rack. If you leave the bread in the pan to cool, the bottom of the crust will get soggy. Let the bread cool for a few minutes before serving it.


If the bread crumbles a lot while you’re slicing it, let the bread cool for a few more minutes. This will give the loaf more time to firm up.

Put olive oil in an opaque or dark glass bottle or stainless steel container.,
Keep olive oil in a container that has a tight lid.,
Store some types of olive oil in the refrigerator.,
Store olive oils in a basement or wine cellar.,
Use extra-virgin olive oils within a year, and use lower-quality oils within a few months.",How to Store Olive Oil,"


These negatively affect olive oil, because they can cause too much oxidation, making the oil turn rancid.;
,


The best temperature to store olive oil is at 57 degrees Fahrenheit (14 degrees Celsius).
A room at 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius) is fine, especially if you use a dark tinted or opaque container.
Keep the olive oil in a dark cupboard away from heat sources such as the stove.

,


Dark glass keeps the light out, allowing the oil to last longer.
Do not store your olive oil in plastic, because the PVC (polyvinyl chloride) from the plastic can be absorbed by the oil.
Avoid reactive metals such as copper or iron, because of potential chemical reactions that can make the oil unsafe.
Stainless steel is a safe, nonreactive metal that can be used for olive oil storage.

,


Bottles with cork stoppers work well as long as the stopper fits tightly to keep air out.
Be cautious using metal lids that can rust.

,


Virgin olive oils and lower quality olive oils can be stored in the refrigerator.
The oil may turn cloudy and thicken, but will clear up and thin out when brought to room temperature.
Keep small amounts at room temperature for regular use.
This is also the best way to store olive oils infused with fresh herbs to prevent bacteria from forming.
It is not recommended to store extra-virgin olive oils in the refrigerator, because it can affect the taste, It does not, however, affect the flavor of other types of olive oils.

,


This is the ideal place for storing olive oil.
Bring small amounts of oil out for daily use.

,


Olive oil does not get better with age, but rather it starts to break down over time.
Extra-virgin olive oils have lower acidity and do not break down as quickly.

Wash and peel the sweet potatoes.,
Boil the sweet potatoes for 15 to 20 minutes.,
Slice or mash the sweet potatoes.,
Sprinkle with lemon juice.,
Let cool.,
Transfer the sweet potatoes to airtight containers.,
Freeze for 10 to 12 months.",How to Store Sweet Potatoes2," Wash fresh sweet potatoes with running water and a vegetable brush. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin.


Rinsing the sweet potatoes under running water is not enough to clean them. In order to get them thoroughly clean, you should gently scrub them with a vegetable brush. Scrub gently to avoid bruising the flesh.
If you do not have a vegetable peeler, you can also remove the skin with a small paring knife that has a smooth blade.
Start with fresh sweet potatoes to maximize the length of time they can be stored.

, Fill a large stockpot with water and boil it over high heat. Add the sweet potatoes and cook until tender.


You need to cook the sweet potatoes before you can freeze them, as raw sweet potatoes tend to break down and lose both flavor and nutrients in the freezer.
Boiling is the preferred method of cooking sweet potatoes for freezer storage. The boiling process should take about 20 minutes for a standard-size sweet potato.

, Use a knife to cut the sweet potatoes into thin slices or a potato masher to mash the sweet potatoes.


Do not store the cooked sweet potatoes whole.
You could also use an electric mixer to beat the sweet potatoes into a mashed consistency, instead.

, Add roughly 1 tsp (5 ml) of lemon juice per sweet potato to the slices or mashed mix.


Make sure that the sweet potatoes are coated in the lemon juice. Lemon juice can prevent discoloration, but you should only use a small amount to avoid altering the taste.

, Allow the sweet potatoes to cool before storing them.


Freezing the sweet potatoes while warm can cause cause condensation to build in the container, causing them to spoil sooner.

, Place the mashed sweet potatoes or sliced sweet potatoes in freezer-safe resealable plastic bags or freezer-safe plastic containers.


Do not use metal or glass containers.

, On average, cooked sweet potatoes stored in the freezer can last for 10 to 12 months."

Don't wash potatoes before storage.,
Don't store potatoes in the fridge.,
Don't store cut potatoes in the open.,
Don't store potatoes near fruit.",How to Store Potatoes2," Though it may seem like ""cleaning off"" potatoes will make them less vulnerable to rot, the truth is actually the opposite. Exposing potatoes to moisture shortens their storage life and makes them much more likely to rot. Keep potatoes as dry as possible before and during the storage process.If your potatoes are covered with dirt, let them dry out, then use a dry brush to remove any noticeable clumps. You can (and should) wash them right before you start to cook them.

, As noted above, refrigerators are too cold to store potatoes well. The cold temperatures inside a fridge will cause the potato's starches to convert to sugar, giving it an unappealingly sweet taste. This can also affect their color.If you do put potatoes in the fridge, let them warm to room temperature gradually before cooking. This will reduce the discoloration (though it may not completely eliminate it).

, Once you cut potatoes,cook them as soon as possible. The exposed flesh of the potato doesn't keep well compared to the tougher skin. If you can't cook a bunch of cut potatoes right away, store them under an inch or two of cold water. They will keep for about a day this way without losing their texture or discoloring., Many fruits, like apples, pears, and bananas, excrete a chemical called ethylene. This gas encourages ripening — you may have noticed that your fruits tend to ripen faster when you keep them next to each other. Ethylene can cause your potatoes to sprout early, so store your fruit elsewhere.

Slice the bread into ¾ inch thick pieces. This will help create a thick custardy French toast texture.You can make French toast with fresh or stale Irish soda bread.

, The bread will be dipped in this mixture just before it’s fried. Mix the wet ingredients and seasoning together until the eggs are combined. Don’t worry if there are a few stubborn bits of egg that won’t mix. These bits of egg will cook onto the bread and disappear.

, Place a buttered skillet on the stove over medium heat. Gently press a slice of Irish soda bread in the egg mixture until it’s soaked through. Next, fry it on a buttered skillet until both sides are golden brown. Remove the slice to a plate to cool before serving.If your bread starts to smoke, the heat on your skillet is too high. Turn it down a little bit and keep cooking.

, French toast is a traditionally sweet breakfast. Top a few slices with maple syrup, berries, and powdered sugar for a sugary dish. However, French toast is also delicious in savory dishes. Use French toast slices, bacon, and a fried egg to make a delicious breakfast sandwich.

Research each item’s shelf life.,
Learn recommended temperatures and humidities.,
Find out when is the best time to harvest.,
Pick the best produce.",How to Store Produce in a Root Cellar1," Expect different types of produce to last longer than others when stored in your root cellar. For example, take dried beans, which can last up to one year or even longer, versus broccoli, which only keep for a week or two. Pick up a guidebook for root cellar storage that includes this information, or use online resources to find out how long your preferred produce will keep.Learning this information beforehand will help you decide what to store and how much.;
, Again, expect different types of produce to last longer in certain conditions than others. For instance, both beets and apples fare best in a temperature range between 33 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit (0.5 to 4.4 degrees Celsius). However, beets last longer in 90 to 95% percent humidity, while apples do better between 80 and 85%. Compare recommended conditions versus those in your root cellar. Select produce well suited for your cellar’s average conditions.Conditions can possibly be changed by installing various venting and cooling alterations. However, it is much easier to lower humidity than it is to raise it.
If you’re a beginner, stick to items that need the same conditions to make things easier on yourself.

, If you plan on growing your own produce, find out which point is the most ideal for each type to be harvested when it comes to long-term storage. Again, expect this to vary between foods. Some should be harvested before the first frost, while others may actually benefit from being harvested afterwards. The latter includes:Brussel sprouts
Cabbage
Horseradish
Pumpkins
Rutabagas

, Be discerning when selecting the actual pieces of produce to be stored. Reduce the risk of spoiling the whole batch with the proverbial bad apple. When picking produce, avoid pieces that appear:Bruised

Once thawed, do not refreeze.",How to Store Seafood1," Even if your home is only 5 minutes away from your local grocer, use a freezer bag to keep your frozen seafood safe, rather than letting it sit in your car in a regular plastic or cloth grocery bag. Even ten minutes of thawing can render fish unsafe.If your storage bag has been sitting in a warm car, make sure you pick up some ice or another method of keeping items cold.;
, Before placing your fish in the freezer, check the packaging it came in. If you find any holes or tears, wrap your fish in wax paper or foil to preserve flavor and moisture.Direct exposure to the frigid temperatures of a freezer can cause dryness and freezer burn. Do not skip this step to ensure high-quality, tender fish.

, Rather than storing seafood on the middle or top shelves, store it away from other items in the freezer, preferably on the lowest shelf. Although frozen fish should not be dripping juice or sauce, storing fish away from other foods avoids the risk of cross-contamination., Once you have thawed your fish, avoid placing it back in the freezer. Instead, use your fish immediately. If you cannot cook it right away, you can place it in a crockpot or other slow-cooking tool and come back to it later. This is partly due to taste (re-frozen fish tends to have a dry texture and loss of flavor), and partly due to safety, as the thawing process may have allowed bacteria to grow."

Pour the required amount of milk into a microwave-safe bowl.,
Place a microwavable chopstick in the dish.,
Microwave the milk on high for three to four minutes.,
Remove the milk with pot holders.",How to Scald Milk1," A glass bowl is generally preferred, but a plastic bowl will also work as long as it is labeled safe for use in a microwave. It is important that you pre-measure the milk before scalding it, since you should not pour extra scalded milk back into the jug of un-scalded milk it originally came from.






;
, You could also use a bamboo skewer or any other tool with a long handle that is made from microwavable material. This step is needed in order to prevent the milk from super-heating beyond the temperature of 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius). Super-heated milk can scorch and has the potential to cause serious burns if it spills onto your skin. The tool must break the surface of the milk, however, since it will not be of much use otherwise.








, If your microwave has a rotating plate, make sure that you change the microwave's settings so that the plate does rotate properly. The milk is finished scalding once it begins to boil.









If your microwave does not have a rotating plate, stop the microwave halfway in between the cooking time and turn the container of milk 180 degrees. Otherwise, it may heat unevenly.

, The container will be very hot, so pot holders are essential. Move the container of milk carefully to prevent hot milk from spilling out onto your skin. Place the container on a hotplate, wire rack, or other heat-resistant surface and use it shortly thereafter.

Test for ripeness.",How to Store Peaches1," Unripe peaches should be stored separately from ripe peaches, and the proper storage method will vary based on a peach's level of ripeness.


Examine the appearance. Ripe peaches should have a yellow or gold tint beneath the reddish blush of the peach. Note that the amount of blush does not indicate ripeness; instead, it indicates variety.
Examine the texture by applying gentle pressure to the outer flesh. Do not squeeze the peach, however, since this fruit can bruise easily. Ripe peaches should feel firm yet soft, but unripe peaches will feel hard. Mushy peaches are overripe.
Smell the peach. Ripe peaches should have a strong, sweet fragrance. Unripe peaches will have a muted fragrance.

Fill the bowl with just enough water to cover the produce, and use a vegetable brush to scrub fruits and veggies clean.


When you're finished washing the produce, you can reuse the water to water plants in the house and garden.
Running faucets can waste around 4 gallons (15 liters) of water per minute.;
, Some people defrost foods by running cold water over them, but this is very wasteful. Instead, plan ahead and defrost foods in the refrigerator the day before. If you don’t have time for a refrigerator defrost, you can quickly defrost frozen items in the microwave using the defrost setting.Foods should never be thawed at room temperature, in warm water, or in the sun, as this can lead to food-borne illness.

, One-pot meals have the advantage of being easy to prepare and easy to clean up, and this means fewer dishes to wash and less water for cleanup.Great ideas for one-pot meals include:


Lasagna
Casserole
Curry
Stroganoff
Pasta
Roast
Risotto
Pizza

, Steaming food requires significantly less water than boiling, and it helps preserve more nutrients in the food. For dishes that require water-based cooking methods, opt for steaming.You don’t need a special appliance for steaming, as long as you have a steamer basket or insert that can be used in a pot.


When the steaming process is finished, let the water cool and reuse it to water plants.

, It’s sometimes unavoidable that you'll have to boil certain foods. But you can still save water by reusing the water you used to cook the food in the first place. When you're done with the cooking water, drain the water into a bowl. Set it aside to cool, and reuse it to:Boil other foods
Cook rice and other grains
Make bread
Make soups or stocks
Water plants

, Reducing the size of the pot you use when you boil foods will reduce the amount of water needed to fill the pot. When you're cooking foods like pasta and potatoes, choose the smallest pot possible, and only add enough water to cover the food.To prevent evaporation and the food from drying out, place a lid on the pot during the boiling process, and stir regularly as the food boils.

, Bottled water is a very resource-heavy consumer product. To create a single liter (34 ounces) of bottled water, at least 1.4 liters (51 ounces) of water is needed, because plastic production uses a great deal of water.Instead of buying bottled water, outfit your kitchen tap with a filter if you're concerned about water purity. Fill reusable metal or glass water containers to have water on the go.

, Many people prefer drinking cold water, but this often means having to let the taps run while you wait for the water to get cold. Instead of running the water, fill a pitcher with warmer water from your tap and chill it in the refrigerator to get it cold.You can even fill and store your re-useable water containers with warm water and store them in the refrigerator to get the water nice and cold.

, While it may seem that a dish-using appliance like a dishwasher will use more water than you do, newer dishwashers are very water-efficient. In fact, whereas you'll use around 20 gallons (76 L) of water hand washing a load in the sink, the dishwasher will only use 4.5 gallons (17 L).Some dishwashers are also equipped with special fast or economy cycles that use even less water, and these are ideal for lightly soiled dishes.

, Even if you use a water-saving dishwasher, it’s still important to wait until the appliance is full before turning it on. This is because the dishwasher uses the same amount of water no matter how full it is, so you can maximize water use by only running full loads., When you do have to wash dishes by hand, you can save water by putting in the plug and filling the basin with soapy water rather than leaving the water running. Only fill the sink with as much water as you need to wash the dishes.


Similarly, rinse dishes in a sink full of clean water rather than running water over them., Even a minor leak in a faucet can add up to 3,000 gallons (11,356 L) of wasted water over the course of a year.To prevent this waste and save the water, address a faucet leak as soon as you discover it by fixing it yourself or calling a plumber.


While you wait for the leak to be fixed, catch as much dripping water as possible by installing a bucket under the leaking water. You can use this water for cooking, cleaning, and in the garden.

, New water-friendly faucets are low-flow models, and this means they use less water per minute than conventional faucets. In fact, you can reduce the flow rate of the water coming out of your faucet by over 3 gallons (11 L) per minute by switching to a low-flow faucet.When shopping for a new faucet, look for terms like low-flow, water-efficient, water-smart, and water sense.

, Motion sensors on the faucet can also help you save water in the kitchen because they automatically shut off when you pull your hands away. Because of this, it’s not possible to leave the water running when you don’t need it!Automatic faucets are also great for cleaning and sanitation, because you don’t have to use your dirty hands to turn the faucets on.

, Adding more insulation to water pipes helps prevent heat from getting lost through the pipes. This can help you save water because hot water will get to your taps faster, and you won’t waste as much water waiting for the hot to arrive when you're doing dishes and such.


When you do have to let the water run to get to temperature, use a bucket or pitcher to catch the water and use it for cooking, cleaning, or drinking., Garbage disposals may be convenient, but they waste a lot of water. To use your disposal properly, you have to run water before, during, and after each cycle, and this adds up to a lot of water over the year.


Instead of using the garbage disposal, try composting your own food, or take advantage of neighborhood green waste programs if possible."

Plan ahead and move quickly.,
Handle all produce gingerly.,
Treat your produce to extend its shelf life when advised.",How to Store Produce in a Root Cellar2," Once produce is harvested, it is more vulnerable to spoilage in the time between harvesting and storing. Before harvesting or purchasing your produce, research what (if any) treatment each type may need in that in-between time. Gather all the materials and have them ready to use for prompt storage.


Root vegetables, for example, are vulnerable to direct heat and sunlight once they’re harvested. They need to be transferred to a cool environment as quickly as possible., Exercise caution when holding or otherwise handling your food. Avoid dropping, poking, or doing anything else that may bruise, cut, or puncture it. If this happens, discard that piece, since it will now spoil quicker and possibly ruin the surrounding produce that it’s stored with., Expect some produce to be ready to transfer to storage as is once harvested. However, be aware that others need a little more prep work to ensure a longer shelf life. If you’re purchasing produce instead of growing it yourself, some of this work may have already be done, but not always. Again, research your preferred produce beforehand so you know exactly what to do when the time comes.


Root vegetables, for example, need to be trimmed, which will typically already be done with store-bought produce. Onions, meanwhile, need to be cured in the sun for a week, which may or may not have been done."
"
Wrap individual pieces when advised.,
Decide on containers.,
Pack with sawdust or sand when advised.,
Find out if anything should be kept separated.,
Consider the height at which they’re kept.,
Organize according to shelf life.",How to Store Produce in a Root Cellar3," As always, expect one type of produce to have different requirements than others. Research each type that you plan to store to find out if pieces can be layered side by side as is or if each piece should have a protective covering. For example, onions can be placed side by side without any barriers, but apples should each be wrapped in newspaper., Again, anticipate each type of produce to need a different style of container for safe storage. Find out the recommended container for each type that you’re storing. For instance:Onions need air circulation, so netted bags are preferred over a solid plastic container.
Dried beans need the exact opposite and should be kept in airtight containers.Tomatoes that are still on the vine, meanwhile, can be hung as is without any containers.

, If you’ve chosen produce that requires high humidity, but you aren’t confident about your root cellar maintaining that humidity consistently, use sawdust or sand as filler in a solid container. Drip water over the surface periodically. This way, the filler absorbs the water and carries it to the produce. Items that benefit from this include root crops like beets and carrots., Be aware that some types of produce should not be kept in close proximity with other certain types. Read up on each type of produce to be included in your root cellar to learn if one should be stored well away from the rest. Consider apples and broccoli, for instance:Apples should be stored in cardboard containers or wooden apple crates, neither of which are airtight. Broccoli meanwhile needs to be stored in perforated plastic bags, which also allows air circulation.
This is a problem because apples emit ethylene gas, which accelerates spoilage in broccoli. Since both containers allow gas to pass through them, apples and broccoli should be kept far apart from each other.

, Remember: cold air descends, while hot air rises. Consider the recommended temperatures for each type of produce. Store those that the need the lowest temperatures on the floor. Stack those that require higher temperatures either on top of those or on shelves., As you package and arrange your produce, keep each one's shelf life in mind. Remember that some produce may only last a matter of weeks, while others will last for a year. To make things easier on yourself, don't bury the more time-sensitive goods underneath the others. Keep them easily accessible since you'll be using these very soon."

Wrap your fish tightly in wax paper, plastic wrap, or foil.,
Keep fresh fish on ice.,
Seal your storage containers.,
Drain melted ice periodically.,
Cook fresh fish within 2 days.",How to Store Seafood2," To keep in freshness, it is best to have a tight wrapping around the fish, rather than placing it into a large container. Wrapping will help seal in moisture and flavor, while placing in a larger tin or container may cause the fish to dry out., Although a freezer is too cold for fresh fish, a refrigerator is often too warm an environment. The solution is to place your fish on ice (directly, or still wrapped) inside of the fridge. As the ice melts, you’ll need to drain it, so keep this in mind when choosing a storage method.When you purchase fresh fish, it should be in a similar configuration: over ice, in a sealed container. If your fresh fish is not stored properly prior to purchasing it, skip it.
Sort through shellfish, and throw away any with cracked or broken shells, as they may have been contaminated.

, Once your fish has been wrapped (if flesh is exposed) and properly covered in ice, seal the container you’ve placed them in. This will help maintain freshness and discourage bacterial growth., Because your fish should not be placed into water, make sure you remove any melted ice during the storage period. You can place the ice in a colander, then place the colander into a bowl, or you can place your ice into a plastic bag for easy clean-up., Fresh fish can spoil quickly and easily, so use whatever fresh fish you have within 2 days of catching or purchase. If you cannot get to it within that time frame, cook it and store the cooked fish, which will last a bit longer, and will not run as high a risk of spoiling.If you cannot get to your fresh fish within two days, follow the freezing recommendations to salvage the fish you’ve not gotten to.

Avoid fresh water.,
Store in an open container.,
Keep your seafood cool using a fridge or cooler.,
Do not freeze.,
Cook the same day.",How to Store Seafood3," Seafood does not live in fresh water, and will not survive in it. Do not store live seafood such as a lobster in fresh water. You run the risk of killing the creature and ruining the meat.Live seafood does require some moisture, but instead of placing water in your storage container, place damp paper towels or even moist seaweed in the container. This will provide additional moisture without risking the creatures’ lives.

, Unlike already-deceased fish, you want to store live seafood in an open container to facilitate oxygen circulation. A sealed container cuts off oxygen, and will kill your dinner well before you’ve had a chance to cook it. Whether you use a cardboard box, an open cooler, or a paper bag, make sure your live seafood has a means of getting air.If the prospect of having a lobster in an open container makes you uncomfortable, you can also place live seafood into a cardboard box and cut holes in the top.

, Although bacteria will not accumulate on live seafood, seafood is accustomed to cold temperatures. To thrive, live seafood does best in temperatures under 40 degrees F (4.44 C). To make sure your seafood is not harmed, place a thermometer in your fridge and make sure it reads less than 40 degrees F (4.44 C).

Most refrigerators are set to temperatures below 40 degrees F (4.44 C). If this is the case with your fridge, a temporary solution such as an ice-filled sink, or ice-filled cooler will work.

, Live seafood is sold that way for a reason. Avoid the temptation to freeze the critters you are set to imbibe, and keep them alive and healthy until the time to cook them has arrived. Freezers are best for already-frozen fish and seafood, as the packaging and freezing method have been tailored to keep these items fresh and moist., Live seafood is not meant to be kept for extended periods. If you know you are not going to be able to get too cooking one day, save lobster for another time. You cannot effectively store live seafood for extended periods.Although some seafood can last for 2-3 days after purchase, you will experience the best taste and texture if your seafood is eaten the same day as it is purchased.

Rinse a heavy saucepan with cold water.,
Pour the milk into the saucepan.,
Slowly heat the pan of milk over medium-low heat.,
Stir the milk continuously.,
Watch for the formation of steam and bubbles.The milk is heated enough to be considered scalded once small bubbles start to form around the edges of the pan.,
Remove the milk and let it cool.",How to Scald Milk2," By briefly cooling the inside of your pan, you can help regulate the temperature of the milk more carefully, preventing it from heating too quickly on the stove.








, Measure out the precise amount of milk you need for the recipe, since it will be difficult to add more later. You also should not use more than you need since you should not return scalded milk to the container of un-scalded milk it originally came from.








, A low heat setting may not provide enough heat to actually warm the pan up, but anything stronger than a medium heat setting will likely bring the temperature up too quickly, causing the milk to boil and burn before you have the chance to stop it. A medium-low heat works best, but a medium heat can also be used as long as you keep a steady watch of it.








, To prevent the milk from thickening or burning and sticking to the bottom of the pan, frequent stirring is vital. Do not allow the milk to rest for more than 30 to 60 seconds at a time as it heats up.








, Do not allow the milk to start boiling, however. Once the milk has started to boil, it has gotten too hot, and a certain protein inside the milk may be destroyed as a result. The destruction of this protein could lead to a loss of volume in baked goods. Additionally, once milk has gotten hot enough to boil, it is nearly impossible to stop it from sticking to the bottom of the pan and creating a burnt film.








, Lift the pan off the stovetop and transfer it to a heat-resistant surface. You can transfer the milk to a room temperature container to prevent it from continuing to cook, or you can simply keep stirring it until it stops steaming. Most recipes suggest that you allow the milk to cool to a certain temperature before you use it, so you should check the milk periodically with a thermometer until it reaches this temperature.

Pour a small amount of water into the bottom half of a double boiler.,
Add your milk to the top portion of the double boiler.Do not use an estimated or general amount of milk.,
Place the top half into the bottom half.,
Heat the double boiler over medium to medium-high heat.,
Stir the milk occasionally.,
Remove the milk once it begins to steam.,
Allow the milk to cool on a heat-resistant surface.",How to Scald Milk3," Usually, 1 or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water is enough. You want to add enough water to create a generous amount of steam, but you do not want the level of the water to touch the bottom of the top portion of the double boiler.








, Instead, use the exact amount of milk called for in your recipe.








, The top half of the double boiler should rest on the side of the bottom half without touching the surface of the water contained in the bottom half. If the top half does meet the surface of the water, dump some of the water out and try again.








, Medium heat is still recommended for this method, but since you are not heating the milk over direct heat and are instead relying on the steam produced by the boiling water, you can get away with a slightly higher level of heat. At minimum, the water in the bottom half needs to bubble and steam, but it will ideally reach a simmer or low boil.








, The milk does not need to be stirred quite as frequently as it would be if you scalded it over direct heat, but it still needs to be stirred briefly every minute or two in order to prevent it from forming a film or burning to the bottom of the pan.








, Small bubbles should also form along the side of the pot. You can either remove the entire double boiler from the heat or you can simply lift the top portion of the double boiler out.








, Check the scalded milk with an instant-read food thermometer until it cools to the desired temperature.

Place whole, unripe peaches in a paper bag.,
Store at room temperature for several days.",How to Store Peaches2," You can place multiple unripe peaches in the same bag, but you should not include any ripe peaches.


Keep some empty space inside the bag and close it loosely. Cramming too many peaches too tightly into the same bag can bruise the fruit.
Do not place the peaches in a plastic bag or airtight container. You must use a paper bag so that the peaches can be exposed to some airflow.
Technically, you can skip this step and store unripe peaches without using a paper bag, but bagging the peaches should speed up the ripening process.;
, Place the peaches on your kitchen counter and keep them there until they finish ripening. The process should take one to three days, depending on how unripe the peaches currently are.Unripe peaches must be stored at temperatures above 51 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius), but room temperature is best.Do not refrigerate unripe peaches. Refrigerating them at this stage can cause discoloration of the interior flesh and may also decrease the flavor, texture, and juiciness of the fruit.
Check the progress of the peaches each day. Remove any ripe peaches from the bag while the rest continue ripening.

"
"
Rinse the peaches.,
Place whole, ripe peaches in a plastic bag.,
Refrigerate for several days.",How to Store Peaches3," Clean ripe peaches by rinsing them under cool, running water. Gently dry the peaches with clean paper towels.


If you dislike the taste and texture of peach ""fuzz,"" you should be able to gently rub most of it off while rinsing the fruit. Use your fingers to do so; do not use a vegetable brush or other rough material.

, Place the ripe peaches in a large plastic bag and seal the top.


Note that you should use a plastic bag, not a paper bag. The bag should be relatively airtight to prevent excess exposure to airflow during this stage.
You can place multiple peaches in one bag, but avoid cramming too many into the same bag since doing so could bruise some of the fruit.

, Place the bagged peaches in your refrigerator. They should remain fresh for at least three to five days, but some peaches last up to one week.


Allow each refrigerated peach to return to room temperature before eating it. Remove the peach from its bag and set it out on your kitchen counter or table for approximately 30 minutes. Doing so improves the flavor of the fruit."

Coat sliced peaches with lemon juice.,
Place the slices in an airtight container.,
Refrigerate for one or two days.",How to Store Peaches4," If you've already cut open a ripe peach, brush lemon juice over all cut surfaces of the fruit.


The acidic lemon juice should help prevent the cut flesh from browning too quickly. If you don't have lemon juice, orange juice or a solution made from concentrated citric acid would work just as well.

, Arrange the peach halves, quarters, or slices in a plastic container or thick plastic bag. Firmly seal the container to block out excess air.


If using plastic bags, seal the majority of the opening, leaving only a small gap. Squeeze as much air out of this gap as possible or use a straw to suck the air out. Afterward, finish sealing the bag
You can place multiple peaches in the same bag or container, but avoid stuffing the container since doing so could damage the fruit.

, Place the sealed peaches in the refrigerator and use them within one or two days.


Note that cut peaches do not last as long as whole peaches, so you should only use this method if you've already cut the peaches and need to save the leftovers.
While peaches generally taste best when served at room temperature, allowing cut peaches to sit out at room temperature is not recommended since it may speed up the browning of cut surfaces. Enjoy these peaches directly from the refrigerator, if possible.

Combine sugar and ascorbic acid.,
Wash and slice the peaches.,
Coat the peaches with the prepared blend.,
Pack the peaches in freezer-safe jars.,
Freeze for several months.",How to Store Peaches5," Thoroughly mix 1 tsp (5 ml) of ascorbic acid with 1 cup (250 ml) of white granulated sugar.Both the sugar and ascorbic acid act as preservatives, but the ascorbic acid also prevents the peaches from turning brown after you slice them.
This amount should be enough to coat several peaches. If you need more, mix another batch using the same proportions.

, Rinse the peaches under cold running water, then cut them into halves, quarters, or slices.


Work with only one or two peaches at a time. The cut peaches can brown quickly, so it's best to handle the peaches in small batches.
Cold water is ideal since it helps the fruit remain firm.
Remove the pit from the center of the peach before continuing.
You can leave the peel on the peaches or remove it. To remove it, blanch each peach in boiling water for 30 seconds, then immediately transfer it to a bowl of ice water. You should be able to slide the peel off with your fingers or a small knife afterward.

, Sprinkle the ascorbic acid sugar over the peaches. Coat the entire peach slice, paying special attention to any area with exposed flesh.

, Layer the cut peaches into an airtight, freezer-safe container or jar.


Packing the jar snug will limit the amount of air inside it, thereby preserving the peaches longer. You should not squeeze the peaches together, though, since doing so could damage the fragile flesh.
Fill the jar roughly three-quarters full. This will give the peaches adequate room to expand during the freezing process.

, Place the peach-filled containers in your freezer and use them within 10 to 12 months.


Thaw the peaches before use. Transfer the frozen peaches to your refrigerator for several hours or let them sit out on your kitchen counter for 30 to 45 minutes.

Store in airtight containers.,
Refrigerate within 2 hours of cooking.,
Avoid temperatures between 40 and 140 degrees F (4.44-60 C).,
Store seafood separately from other foods.,
Eat within 2-3 days.",How to Store Seafood4," As with fresh fish, store your leftovers in airtight containers to prevent the growth of bacteria and limit the risk of cross-contamination., Even cooked fish should be handled carefully, and should be left out no longer than 2 hours after being cooked. The longer food is left out after cooking, the higher the risk is of bacteria developing and growing. If you have left food out past this time frame, the safest option is to throw the food away., This temperature range is often called the “danger zone,” as it provides the ideal breeding ground for germs and bacteria. When storing your leftovers, make sure your fridge is set to a temperature below 40, and while cooking, make sure your oven has reached a temperature higher than 140., If you’ve made a dinner of fish and broccoli, for instance, store each in their own container. Fish goes dry and rancid faster than most vegetables, grains, and even other meats. Whenever possible, store fish with fat or marinades intact., Ideally, you should consume your leftover fish within 1-2 days. Any longer, and your fish may become dry or develop a slimy covering. Fish that has gone beyond this window should be thrown out."

Buy fresh carrots at a farmer's market near you, or think about growing your own. If neither option is possible, get them at a produce shop or in your grocery store. Do not use frozen carrots. Fresh, raw carrots will taste and cook better.
Look for dark orange carrots for the best health benefits. Darker carrots are higher in vitamin A.;
, With a sharp knife, cut off the top of the carrots with the green sprouts and the very bottom point of the carrots. Be sure to remove any roots and leaves.

, Place them in a strainer under cold running water.


Scrub the carrots if you are not going to peel them. Otherwise, use a peeler to scrape off the outer layer of the carrot.







, You can cut them into slices or cubes, or simple chunks of bite sized pieces.


Use baby carrots or carrots that are already chopped or sliced if you want to save yourself time. These may cost a little more, and you will need to use them by the expiration date on their package.

, You can also spread olive oil on the bottom of the pan if you prefer it to the spray.

, Make sure the pan or sheet can accommodate all the carrots. Crowding the carrots will cause the vegetables to steam and may take longer to cook.

,


Use additional spices, herbs or other ingredients with your carrots. These will depend on your own personal tastes and any recipes you may want to follow. You can add sage, garlic, rosemary, basil, oregano, parsley and even other vegetables.







, Place the baking pan with the carrots into the oven.


Cook for 30 to 40 minutes, until the carrots begin to brown. The length of time will really depend on your own taste. Some people like to have their roasted carrots with a bit of a crunch, which would require a shorter cooking time. Others prefer them darkly roasted and soft from extra heat.






Flip or stir the carrots halfway through your cooking time. Use a spatula or a large spoon to mix them in the pan.







, They will finish cooking outside of the oven.

, They go well with meats such as chicken, pork or beef. You could also toss them with pasta or rice, or add them as a side to any dish.

, Eat them within 3 to 5 days for best taste and freshness.

Pour the rice into a bowl.,

Tilt the bowl to pour out the starchy water.,
""Punch"" the rice gently.,
Rinse and repeat.,
Soak the rice if desired.,
Understand the effect of rinsing on starch.,
Rinse off contaminants.,
Save the nutrients on enriched rice.,
Consider arsenic risk for young children.",How to Rinse Rice," Choose a wide bowl with room to stir the rice. You can instead use a special rice-draining colander, which has extra-small holes so the water pools and drains slowly.;
, Fill the bowl with tap water until the rice is completely covered. About three times as much water as rice should work.

, The rice will rub against itself, your hands, and the bowl, which scrapes the starch off. Use light pressure to avoid breaking the rice grains., Since rice is not buoyant, it will sink to the bottom of the bowl. Pour out the cloudy water, plus anything that has floated to the surface. Pour the water through the palm of your hand so you can catch any rice that slips out.If the water looked dirty or an opaque, milky white, you can repeat this process with a second bowl of water.
As long as there is no dirt or pesticides in the water, you can save it to add to recipes. The most common use of starchy water is as a thickener for sauces.

, At this point, many Western cooks may be satisfied moving on to cooking the rice. Japanese and other Asian traditions, however, put great value in cleaning the rice thoroughly to achieve a perfect, fluffy texture. The next step in that process is ""polishing"" the rice grains against each other. Curl your fingers into a loose fist and punch the rice gently at a steady pace. Turn the bowl between punches to move the wet rice around the bowl, grinding it lightly against itself., After a few punches, pour in more water, swirl the rice around, and pour it out again. ""Punch and turn"" a few more times, add more water, and pour it out. Repeat this until the water runs clear. Depending on the type of rice and how it was processed, this may take a couple bowlfuls of water, or it may take several minutes of washing.

, Transfer the wet rice to a mesh sieve to drain. Leave it there to soak for at least thirty minutes if you have the time. This gives the moisture on the rice time to soak into the center of the grain, ensuring an even texture once cooked.


Soaking your rice lowers the cooking time. The exact amount of time it saves depends on the type of rice and how long you soaked it, so you may need to experiment.
Aromatic rices such as basmati and jasmine rice benefit from soaking in another way. The flavor components that create the aroma are destroyed by cooking, so shorter cooking times means a more aromatic final dish., One major effect of rinsing is the removal of starch that clings to the outside of the rice grains. If left unrinsed, the starch can cause rice grains to stick together, creating clumps or a glutinous texture.When you're making steamed rice, rinse it first to remove the starch and make clump-free, fluffy rice. If you're making a creamy dish like risotto, or a sticky dish like rice pudding, however, you need the starch to achieve the right texture. Thorough rinsing will remove that starch and leave you with a watery dish.Short-grain rice is the most likely to stick together, while long-grain rice like basmati tends to cook into dry, separated grains.If you want to make risotto but the rice is dirty, rinse it, then add a couple spoonfuls of homemade rice flour to the recipe. This will return the starch to the dish., In the United States, most domestically grown rice has been washed before sale, and contains few contaminants. Rice grown in many other countries, however, may contain dirt, insects, pesticides, or small rocks. If you notice a powder on the surface of the grain, this may be talc or another substance added to improve appearance. This is edible, but your rice will cook better and taste better if you rinse it off.Contaminants may be more likely in bulk bags of rice.

, Enriched white rice has been thoroughly washed, then coated with a dust of vitamins and nutrients. Rinsing will remove a large portion of these beneficial ingredients.


This rice is typically low in dirt and other contaminants, but it does still contain surface starch.
In the United States, some enriched rice labels include a warning not to rinse the rice for this reason. If U.S. enriched rice does not have this label, you can rinse it for one minute without major loss of nutrients., More than other crops, rice tends to pick up arsenic that naturally occurs in in water and soil. If rice is a major part of an infant's or pregnant woman's diet, this could affect the child's development. The US FDA recommends feeding babies and toddlers a variety of grains (instead of only rice) to reduce this risk. Rinsing only has a small effect on arsenic content. A more effective treatment is cooking the rice in lots of water (a 1:6 to 1:10 ratio), then draining the excess water before eating."

Preheat your oven.,
Fill a tray with a single layer of nuts.,
Stir once or twice during cooking.,
Roast until the nuts are brown and fragrant.,
Peel the nuts.,
Let cool before eating.",How to Roast Nuts1," Wait for your oven or toaster oven to heat to 350ºF or 175ºC.


Optionally, use the broiler setting to cook the nuts from above. This makes it easier to check on the progress of the nuts, since the toasted side is easily visible.;
, Pour the nuts onto a tray or baking dish with sides. Keep them in a loose, single layer to allow air circulation. Place the tray, ungreased, in the oven.

, For most nuts, stirring every five minutes is enough to avoid burning. Stir the nuts or shake the tray gently to move the nuts at the edge to the center, and vice versa.


The smaller the nuts, the easier they are to burn. Check on pine nuts or chopped nuts every two or three minutes.Toaster ovens tend to have less even heat distribution. If using one, you may need to stir two or three times to avoid burning.

, The nuts are ready once golden brown with a strong, toasted smell. Check on them often once they approach these estimated times, or the nuts can quickly turn bitter and burnt:Pine nuts: 5 minutes
Pistachios: 6–8 minutesAlmonds: 8 minutes if sliced, 10 if whole

, The thin, papery skin on many nuts becomes looser during roasting. If you'd like to remove it, fold a towel around the nuts and rub vigorously until the skin flakes off. For large batches, finish by spinning the nuts in a salad spinner to remove small pieces.If the nuts are still in the shell, crack them with a nutcracker or by wrapping in a towel and pressing down. The shells may be softer when hot, but be wary of escaping steam.

, Roasted nuts are still soft fresh out of the oven. Let them cool to near room temperature to develop a crunch.Transfer leftovers to the fridge once completely cool, in a sealed container.


Roasted chestnuts are best eaten soft and warm.

Make sure that you seal the container or freezer bag correctly, making sure that you remove all air, as any air contact will cause ""freezer burn"" on the meat.,
Meat can be wrapped or interwoven with waxed paper or freezer paper for ease of separation.

Pour the nuts into a heavy skillet or frying pan.,
Heat over medium heat.,
Stir frequently.,
Let cool.",How to Roast Nuts2," The stovetop method is quick, but can easily burn the nuts if you're not careful. Use a cast iron skillet or another heavy-bottomed pan that heats up slowly and evenly. Add the nuts in a single layer, leaving plenty of space to stir them.


There is no need to add oil.

, The nuts will turn light brown and release a strong aroma as they toast. This only takes a couple minutes for most nuts.Brazil nuts, walnuts, and other large nuts may take longer.


You can roast nuts in the shell, but it will take longer — roughly ten minutes.

, Nuts will quickly burn if you leave one side touching the pan for too long. Stir often to roast the nuts as evenly as you can. When roasting small pieces such as pine nuts or chopped nuts, stir or toss constantly.

, Pour the nuts into a bowl as soon as they turn a light golden brown. They will become crunchier as they cool. Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge.

Toss the nuts in a little oil.,
Spread out the nuts on a microwave-safe plate.,
Cook in one-minute intervals.",How to Roast Nuts3," If you microwave nuts dry, they will not end up crisp or browned as they do in traditional cooking. Instead, toss the nuts in a small spoonful of oil or butter, roughly ½ tsp per ½ cup (5 mL per 120 mL) or just enough to coat them. This will help the outside cook faster than the inside, recreating that crunch., Microwave no more than ½ cup (120 mL) at a time, to avoid uneven cooking.Keep them in a single layer.

, Cook for one minute, stir, and repeat. Small nuts are usually ready in two to four one-minute sessions, while large nuts may take eight or so.The nuts will turn light brown if you oiled them, but not as much as they would in the oven. For this method, taste tests are a more reliable way to tell when they're done.

Place the kale in an airtight plastic bag.,
Surround the kale with paper towels.Place a clean, dry paper towel into the bag with the kale.,
Refrigerate for several days.,
Rehydrate as needed.,
Wash immediately before use.",How to Store Kale1," Pack the kale into a resealable plastic bag, but do not seal the bag yet.


If you're working with a larger batch of kale, place the kale into an airtight plastic container. Keep the leaves relatively loose and don't pack the container too full since doing so could bruise or otherwise damage the kale.;
, Squeeze out as much air from the bag as possible before sealing it.


The paper towel should be able to absorb any excess moisture and prevent the kale from spoiling faster.
When storing kale in plastic containers, line the bottom of the container with one paper towel before putting the kale inside, then place a second paper towel over the top of the kale before sealing the container.

, Place the kale in the crisper drawer of your refrigerator and use it within five to seven days.


If you don't have a crisper drawer, keep the kale in the door compartment or on a standard refrigerator shelf with the stems facing toward the back of the refrigerator. The back of the refrigerator is the coldest area, and the stems are the hardiest portion of the kale, so they're less likely to become damaged from the cold.
Note that the kale may become more bitter after several days, even with proper storage, so it's still best to use it as soon as possible., If the kale begins to dry out and wilt, you can rehydrate it by dunking the bundle into cool to lukewarm water for approximately 10 minutes.If you need to continue storing the kale afterward, thoroughly dry it using a salad spinner before returning it to the bag. Wet kale will spoil faster.

, Rinse the kale under cool, running water and dry thoroughly with clean paper towels prior to using or consuming it.


Do not wash the kale prior to storing it. Doing so could introduce too much moisture into the storage container and may result in quicker spoilage.

Open chilled pouches slowly.,
Do not re-freeze.",How to Store Green Tea to Keep Fresh," Well-made tea lasts longer. It has undergone high heat fixation process that kills tea enzymes. It should be dried to to 2% to 3% moisture level.;
, The best green tea is harvested from February to April. Buy early spring and enjoy them for the rest of the year.

, Make sure your vendor uses a heat sealed polyfoil laminate. It is the only air-tight container. Other containers such as polythene bags, Ziploc bags and tea tins are not truly airtight.

, Once you open your sealed pouch, store in a cool, dark cupboard, in a part of the house where temperature is fairly even. Temperature change can induce water inside the tea container.

, As your container is not likely to be truly airtight, try to consume it as soon as possible, preferably within 2 months.

, Unopened pouches may be stored in a fridge or freezer. Temperature cycles can cause ice crystals and ""freezer burn"" to form. The ideal fridge is a chest freezer, as cold air stays below when the lid is opened. Insulate pouches in a box.

, Wait for it to warm to room temperature before opening. This will prevent air moisture from condensing.

, Once you have opened your sealed pouches, do not keep them in a freezer. This is because the tea will be somewhat damp, and re-freezing and the subsequent thawing will dampen it even further.

Wash the kale.,
Blanch and cool.,
Dry the kale.,
Remove the stems.,
Tray freeze the kale.,
Place in airtight freezer bags.,
Freeze for several months.",How to Store Kale2," Dunk the kale in dish of cold water or rinse it thoroughly under cool, running water.


Separate the leaves using your fingers to remove any debris caught at the base of the leaves. Organic kale may have pests that need to be removed, as well.
While plain water should clean the kale adequately enough in most circumstances, you could use a vinegar rinse for a more thorough solution. Mix up to 3 Tbsp (45 ml) of white distilled vinegar into 1 gallon (4 L) of cool water. Dunk the kale inside the solution and allow it to sit for 20 to 30 minutes., Boil a saucepan of water on the stove, then dip the kale into the boiling water and cook for 2 minutes.Immediately transfer the blanched kale to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process and prevent the leaves from wilting.
Blanching is recommended but not strictly necessary. If you choose not the blanch the kale, however, you'll need to separate the leaves from the stems more thoroughly later on. Additionally, kale that isn't blanched may become bitter and won't last as long in the freezer.

, Place the wet kale into a salad spinner. Spin the kale until the leaves are thoroughly dry.


If you don't have a salad spinner, wrap the kale in paper towels and gently squeeze it to wring out the excess moisture. Allow it to continue sitting out for 10 to 20 minutes to drain away as much additional moisture as possible.
The kale must be dry before you freeze it. If the kale is still wet, the leaves may develop freezer burn or become bitter while in storage.

, Use a sharp knife to trim away the woody stems from the bottom of each kale leaves. Remove as much of the stem as possible.


If you didn't blanch the kale, you'll need to remove the portion of the stem running up the center of the leaves, as well. To do this, fold the leaves in half along the stem and slice or yank the stem away. Chop or tear the remaining leaves into smaller pieces before continuing.

, Spread out clumps of kale over a large baking sheet, then place the baking sheet into the freezer. Freeze for 1 to 2 hours, or until solid.


By tray freezing the kale, you can keep the leaves separate from one another, making it easier to remove and thaw some kale without thawing all of it.
You can skip the tray freezing step, if desired, but you'll need to thaw the entire batch at once before using it later.

, Pack the kale into a large freezer-safe bag. Squeeze out as much air as possible, then seal the bag closed.


While airtight bags work best, you could also use an airtight plastic container. Tightly pack the kale into the container, leaving about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace between the top of the kale and the top of the container.

, Place the kale in your freezer and store it until you're ready to use it. Blanched kale can last for 10 to 12 months, and unblanched kale can last for 4 to 6 months.


For best results, thaw the kale in the refrigerator prior to cooking or eating it.

Choose a 5/6 lbs duck.,
Remove the giblets.,
Clean the bird.,
Score the fat.,
Season and truss the duck.,
Roast the duck at 300 °F (149 °C) for one hour.,
Prick the skin and flip the duck over.,
Repeat this process for the next two hours.,
Remove the fat and finish roasting.,
Add the glaze (optional).,
Let it rest.,
Make a sweet and spicy glaze.,
Make an orange and sage glaze.,
Make a balsamic vinegar and honey glaze.,
Make a plum and applesauce.,
Make a lemon and redcurrant sauce.",How to Roast a Duck," To prepare a roast duck dish that will serve 2 people, you will need to buy a 5/6 lbs duck. The most common varieties are Pekin or Long Island ducks, which have a pleasantly mild flavor. Muscovy ducks have a stronger, more gamy flavor., Remove the duck from its packaging, then remove the giblets from the cavity. You can do with these as you please: some people just throw them away, while others reserve the liver for making duck liver pâté and use the other giblets to make stock.

, Once the giblets have been removed, wash the duck in cold running water. Shake it out to remove any water from the cavity, then pat the duck with paper towels until the ski is very dry. Place the dried duck on a wire rack over a deep roasting pan lined with paper foil.

, Take a small, sharp paring knife and use it to score a crosshatch (diamond) pattern on the suck breast.


Be very careful -- you only want to score the fat, not the meat underneath. This is easier if you hold the knife at an angle.
Next, prick the duck all over with the point of the knife -- again, you only want to prick the skin, not the meat underneath. Doing this will allow more fat to escape from the skin and will produce a crispier roasted duck.Now, use the knife to remove any excess skin on either side of the cavity. You can discard this skin, or simmer it in water to remove the fat.

, Season the inside and outside of the duck with coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper. Truss the legs by crossing them and tying them with a piece of butcher's twine.


Before you truss the legs, you can fill the cavity with a quartered onion or a quartered orange -- this helps to keep the duck moist and adds moisture.Cut off the tips of the wings at the final joint, then tuck the wings underneath the duck (just as you would when roasting a chicken).

, Place the duck on the second lowest rack of the oven, which should be pre-heated to 300 °F (149 °C). Roast, breast-side up, for one hour.

, After the first hour of roasting, pull the roasting tin from the oven and prick the duck's skin with a sharp knife to release the melted fat.


Pay particular attention to the areas around the legs, as these are particularly fatty.
Flip the duck over so it's breast-side down, return it to the oven and roast for another hour.

, After the second hour, remove the duck from the oven, prick it all over to release the fat, then turn it breast-side up and return it to the oven for another hour.


After the third hour, prick the fat and turn the duck breast-side down and return to the oven for the final hour of roasting.
The duck should be getting progressively browner and crispier as time goes on.

, After the fourth hour of roasting, remove the duck from the oven. Turn the oven temperature up to 400 °F (204 °C) and wait for it to pre-heat.


While you're waiting, spoon the duck fat from the bottom of the roasting tin. Be very careful doing this, as the fat is extremely hot and could cause a nasty burn.
Once cooled, the duck fat will keep for several months in the fridge. It can be used to make delicious roast potatoes and veggies, or even to add flavor to a roast chicken!
Once the oven reaches 400 °F (204 °C), place the duck back in the oven, breast-side up and roast for 10 more minutes. This will help the skin to get really crisp.

, After ten minutes, remove the duck from the oven. If you are using a glaze (like one of the ones described below), brush it liberally over the skin of the duck.


Then return the bird to the oven to cook for another 5 to 7 minutes at 400 °F (204 °C), until it is dark brown in color. Watch the duck carefully during this time, as you don't want it to burn!
Instead of using a glaze, you can simply serve the roasted duck with a sauce on the side (recipes can be found below). If you go for this option, there's no need to return the duck to the oven for these final 5 to 7 minutes.

, Once you've removed the duck from the oven, allow it to rest on the wire rack for 10 minutes. Carve the duck just like you'd carve a roast chicken and serve., To make this sweet and spicy glaze you will need:


1/4 cup of honey
1/4 cup of molasses
3 tablespoons of orange juice
1 tablespoon of soy sauce
1 1/2 tablespoons of sriracha
Combine all of the ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a simmer over a low heat. Raise the temperature to a medium-high heat and whisk the mixture constantly until it thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon.
Set the glaze aside until you are ready to use on the duck. If it becomes too thick, heat it up in the microwave before using.

, To make this citrus-y, herb-y glaze you will need:


3/4 cup of fresh orange juice
2 tablespoons of freshly chopped sage
1/2 cup + 1 tablespoon of orange marmalade
1 1/2 tablespoons of brandy
Add the orange juice and sage to a saucepan and boil over a high heat until approximate 1/4 cup of liquid remains. Reduce the heat, add the remaining ingredients and simmer until the glaze becomes thick and bubbly.
Set the glaze aside until ready to use., To make this tart glaze you will need:


10 tablespoons + 2 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar
1/4 cup of honey
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon red wine vinegar
Add the 10 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, honey and pepper to a saucepan and boil over a high heat until the mixture thickens. Stir constantly until the glaze is reduced to 3 tablespoons of liquid.
Remove from the heat, then add the 2 teaspoons of balsamic and 1/2 teaspoon of red wine vinegar. Keep the glaze warm until ready to use on the duck.

, To make this delicious red applesauce, you will need:


2 lbs red apples, quartered and seeded
2lbs red or black plums, quartered and pitted
1/4 cup of water
1/4 cup of sugar
Place all of the ingredients in a heavy-bottomed saucepan (with a lid) and cook over a medium heat for an hour and 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the fruit is very soft and tender.
Push the fruit through a fine-meshed strainer to remove the fruit skins. Serve the sauce alongside the roasted duck (or enjoy on its own as dessert!), This is a simple yet tasty sauce for when you need to throw something together in a hurry.


All you need to do is mix 1 cup of redcurrant jelly with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice in a small saucepan.
Bring the sauce to the boil, then push through a fine-meshed strainer and serve with the roasted duck.

Decide on long-term storage areas.,
Designate a second space for in-use items.,
Decide on which containers to use.,
Use creative solutions.",How to Store Food in Bulk1," Choose where to house the bulk of your bulk goods.Prioritize spaces that remain consistently cool, dry, and dark. Whether it’s a spacious basement or a cramped pantry, measure the dimensions so you can fill all of that space effectively with appropriately sized containers.


Whether you’re just trying to reduce the number of shopping trips you make each year, or if you’re prepping to survive the zombie apocalypse, knowing exactly how much space you have to work with will help you store as much food as possible.
If you are planning on buying a freezer dedicated to bulk storage, consider open floor space versus wall space when deciding between an upright or a chest freezer.;
, In addition to long-term storage, appoint a second area in your kitchen to store small containers of the same items for immediate use. Eliminate the hassle of digging through your long-term storage area for that one cup of rice you need right now. At the same time, reduce the risk of disorganizing your carefully arranged storage area when you’re in a hurry.Having long-term and short-term containers will allow you to repurpose long-term containers as they empty. For instance, transferring the last of your dried peas to a smaller container in the kitchen will free the larger container for those dried red lentils that just went on sale.

, Choose between the wide variety of sizes, shapes, and materials (glass or plastic). Factor in the amount of space you have available, as well as how much of a given item you intend to buy. Whatever you choose, make sure the container’s lid forms an airtight seal to preserve the food’s freshness and keep out pests and outside elements.With plastic containers, make sure the exact plastic used is food-safe to prevent unwanted chemicals from leaching into the food.If storage space in your kitchen is limited, use clear containers. Whether their design is plain or decorative, this can be more pleasing to the eye if you have to store them out in the open.For long-term storage, consider a double-line of defense by bagging food before transferring it into the container.

, When you’re faced with limited space, consider other options. Instead of limiting yourself to obvious choices like the pantry or cupboards, expand your horizons. Brainstorm ways to add shelving or other forms of storage by less obvious means.For example:


If there is space between the top of your cabinets and the ceiling, use it. Stand containers on top of the cabinets. Add a shelf between that and the ceiling if space allows to create even more storage space.
Use containers as decor throughout your living space. Install decorative shelves wherever you please, or use containers as bookends on existing bookshelves. Keep plain-looking food (like white flour or rice) in the kitchen while displaying more colorful items (like green and red lentils) elsewhere.
Install new shelves inside pantries and cupboards to create more surface area. Clear existing shelves of smaller items (like canned goods and small bottles) by installing wire racks behind the door.
If you have more vertical space than horizontal, shop for containers that are easily stacked on top of one another.

Let the cupcakes cool.,
Decide when to frost the cupcakes.,
Avoid other edible decorations.",How to Store Cupcakes1," Allow the cupcakes to cool completely before storing them. In most cases, this will take around 30 minutes once you remove the cupcakes from the baking pan.Cooling the cupcakes should help prevent them from releasing moisture and becoming sticky during storage.
Moreover, if you intend to frost the cupcakes before storing them, it will be easier to frost them after they've cooled.

, It's easiest to store unfrosted cupcakes, but you can store frosted cupcakes with some restrictions.


Cupcakes with creamy frostings and no fillings can usually be stored using any method.
Cupcakes with buttercream, cream cheese, or ganache frostings must be refrigerated or frozen due to health concerns. The same is true of cupcakes with fillings that contain dairy or eggs (creams and custards).Cupcakes with whipped cream frostings can only be refrigerated. Do not store them at room temperature or in the freezer.
Cupcakes with fluffy frosting should be served the same day. The frosting will lose some of its integrity if you attempt to store it.

, When possible, do not decorate cupcakes with edible gel, hard candies, sprinkles, or colored sugars prior to freezer storage.


The colors of these decorations may run when you thaw the cupcakes. Moreover, the texture of sprinkles and other candies may soften during storage.
You should, however, be able to apply these decorations if you intend to store the cupcakes at room temperature or in your refrigerator.

Wrap the eggplant in paper bags.,
Store the eggplant in a cool location.,
Keep the eggplant away from other produce.,
Use within three days.",How to Store Eggplant1," Place the whole, uncut eggplant in a large paper bag and loosely wrap the excess paper around the side of the vegetable.


The paper bag absorbs moisture and, as a result, may reduce spoilage. Since paper is permeable, the eggplant can also receive adequate air flow.
If you don't have paper bags, you could wrap the eggplant in paper towels and place it into an unsealed plastic bag or vented bowl.
Do not place the eggplant in a sealed plastic bag since doing so can restrict air flow and increase decay.;
, Keep the eggplant out of direct sunlight and in a relatively cool spot.


The ideal temperature for eggplant is 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). Refrigerators are too cold, but standard room temperature is too warm. Dry, well-ventilated garages work well in cool weather seasons, but cellars and basements might be better during warmer weather., Do not store eggplants together or with other fruits and vegetables. Keep each eggplant separate while in storage.


Many fruits and vegetables produce ethylene gas as they ripen. When exposed to ethylene, eggplants tend to ripen and spoil faster.

, When stored in this manner, most eggplants should remain edible for up to three days.


Ideally, however, you should use the eggplant within 24 hours for the best texture. Eggplants spoil quickly, even when stored correctly.

Store lemons for immediate use.,
Store extra lemons sealed in the refrigerator.",How to Store Lemons1," If you plan to use the lemons within a few days of purchase, store them away from direct sunlight. They typically stay fresh for about one week at room temperature. After this point, they start to wrinkle, lose their vibrant color, and develop soft or hard patches., Place the lemons in zip-locked bags, squeezing out as much air as you can. In this state, the lemons may retain most of their juice and flavor for as long as four weeks.The ideal temperature for storing ripe (yellow) lemons is between 4º and 10ºC (39–50ºF). For most refrigerators, the middle shelves or door shelves are around this temperature.

"
"
Shop with your containers.,
Label your containers.,
Freeze your items after purchase.,
Keep track of what you have.",How to Store Food in Bulk2," One benefit of bulk shopping is minimizing the amount of packaging used. To further this practice, bring your smaller containers along when you go grocery shopping. Fill them directly from the store’s bulk containers to eliminate the need for unnecessary bags.Fill them all the way up each time. Weigh them once you are done. Record the weight so you know exactly how many pounds or grams it weighs. This can help you budget for future trips.

, With opaque containers, label the outside with its contents and purchase date. With clear containers, you can probably identify most items by sight, but still make a point of labeling long-term containers with the purchase date. Ensure a steady rotation so you don’t end up eating the dried chickpeas you bought last week while the ones you bought three months ago sit unlabeled behind everything else.Do the same with frozen-food packages to minimize the loss of quality caused by prolonged freezer burn.
Use permanent marker to prevent the writing from wearing off.
For containers that are reused (as opposed to frozen-food packaging), secure a piece of paper to the side or top with strong tape along all four sides to create each new label.

, Even if you have designated another area for long-term storage, consider placing dried good products in the freezer for a day, week, or even longer.Kill any insects that may have found their way into the store’s bulk bin. At the same time, extend the food’s shelf life by slowing down the natural breakdown that occurs in all foods.Climate (especially one with high humidity) can reduce the shelf life of many foods, even when safely stored in airtight containers and cool, dark places.
If you live in such an area, research each food item to decide which may benefit the most from long-term storage in a freezer or refrigerator.
If adding an extra fridge or freezer to your home isn’t possible, readjust the amount you buy at a time to ensure that you use all of one purchase in a timely manner.

, Be aware that it can be easy to forget what you have in long-term storage. Keep an up-to-date list of everything that’s in there, including their purchase dates. Go the extra mile and record each time you refill short-term containers from long-term ones so you can keep track of how full or how empty the long-term containers are.Doing so will help prevent you from needlessly buying more basmati rice when you have a full bucket shoved all the way in the back and out of view.
Including the purchase date will also help alert you to what should be used soon while it’s still relatively fresh.
Additionally, this is a great way to double-check if you are buying more of one item than you really need.

"
"
Consider your needs.,
Start small.,
Decide on volume.First, create a master list of all your recipes.,
Begin buying in bulk gradually.,
Review your spending habits.",How to Store Food in Bulk3," Understand that the contents of your neighbor’s bulk storage might not reflect your personal concerns. If you have a sweet tooth and plenty of storage space, feel free to stock up on less essential items like cocoa powder for baking brownies. But if you are prepping for long-term survival in the event of a disaster, or if you are simply feeding a very large family, prioritize foods that match the caloric and nutritional needs for all concerned., Before committing yourself to, say, 25 pounds of oats, research recipes based on bulk foods. Only buy enough ingredients at first to cook a single meal for you and your family. Test each recipe to make sure that this is something that you will look forward to eating again and again.Be aware that even dry “non-perishable” items like flour can still spoil over time.Avoid wasting money and space on items that you aren’t going to use very often.

, Then, for each recipe, create a second list that breaks down which bulk foods are used, and how much. Once you are finished, add up the totals for each bulk good. Determine how much you will need of one given product in order to make all of your recipes.


Also factor in how frequently you plan to make each recipe. For instance, if you plan on making cornbread every week, you will want to buy very large amounts of major ingredients like flour and cornmeal. But if you only make it once and a while (and don’t use much flour or cornmeal for anything else), save storage space for more in-demand items.
Use this list when shopping for containers, too, so you can buy the appropriate size and fill your storage space more effectively.

, Be aware that tastes change. Anticipate growing sick of this or that recipe while discovering brand new ones at the same time. Only buy a conservative amount of each item in a single shopping trip, rather than buying an excessive amount at once.If you’re prepping against disaster, taste may be less of a concern than simply stocking up for survival purposes.
Otherwise, only plan to buy enough to last you the next three months.

, Keep your receipts. Track your purchases every quarter. Determine which items you are using the most and restocking the most frequently. Use this information to refine your system in order to:Target which items are worth comparative-shopping at other retailers so you can save more money.
Reorganize which containers you are using for which items to better utilize space.
Stock up on ingredients that you will enjoy eating for years to come once the zombies cripple society.

Place the cupcakes in an airtight container.,
Choose a good location.,
Store for one to two days.",How to Store Cupcakes2," Place both frosted and unfrosted cupcakes in airtight containers.Avoid stacking the cupcakes. Space them apart with enough room for you to reach in and remove them later.
Use tall containers for frosted cupcakes to avoid upsetting the frosting.
Do not wrap unfrosted cupcakes in plastic wrap. When storing them at room temperature, moisture can build up in between the wrap and the top of the cake. As a result, the tops will be sticky and difficult to frost later on.;
, Instead of leaving the cupcakes on your countertop, place the sealed containers in your pantry or in another covered location free of sunlight.


During the hot and humid summer months, you may also need to find a relatively cool area, like a basement pantry.
Humidity and sunlight can heat up the container and the cupcakes, causing the cakes to ""sweat"" moisture and become sticky or soggy around the edges., Place the cupcakes in your chosen location and use within one or two days. After that time, the cupcakes will start turning stale.


Note that cupcakes decorated with fresh fruit should be consumed within one day when stored at room temperature.

"
Wrap unfrosted cupcakes.,
Place frosted cupcakes in airtight containers.,
Store for up to one week.,
Drop the cupcakes to room temperature when ready.",How to Store Cupcakes3," Wrap unfrosted cupcakes in plastic wrap or aluminum foil.


You can store unfrosted cupcakes in airtight containers, if desired, but the plastic wrap will make it easier for the cake to retain moisture. This is important since the process of refrigeration tends to draw moisture out of food.

, Arrange frosted cupcakes in airtight containers. Choose containers that are tall enough to accommodate the height of the frosting.


Leave enough space in between the cupcakes for you to comfortably reach in and grab them.
If the frosting reaches above the height of the container, cover the container with aluminum foil instead of the lid. Tent the foil so that it clears the height of the frosting.

, Place the cupcakes in your refrigerator and store them for two to seven days.


Unfrosted cupcakes should be able to last for seven days inside the refrigerator.
Most frosted cupcakes last for two to four days in the refrigerator. Those decorated with whipped cream or fresh fruit are best when eaten within two days, though., Roughly 20 minutes before you plan to serve the cupcakes, bring them out of the refrigerator and let them drop down to room temperature.


This isn't strictly necessary since you can eat a chilled cupcake, but the texture of the frosting might seem unnaturally stiff if you eat it directly out of the refrigerator.

"
"
Wrap unfrosted cupcakes in plastic wrap.,
Place frosted cupcakes in an airtight container.,
Store for two to four months.,
Thaw before eating.",How to Store Cupcakes4," Wrap each individual cupcake in plastic wrap, then place several wrapped cupcakes into an airtight plastic freezer bag.The double layer of protection should help reduce moisture loss while protecting the cupcakes from freezer burn. Moreover, wrapping them individually before storing them together allows you to thaw whatever amount you need rather than forcing you to thaw the entire batch.

, Arrange frosted cupcakes in an airtight, freezer-safe plastic container.


An airtight container is vital; otherwise, the cakes and the frosting may develop freezer burn.
If you'd rather use plastic wrap than plastic containers, you can do so, but the process is a little trickier. Freeze the cupcakes uncovered for one hour, or until the frosting seems solid and no longer sticky. Insert a toothpick through the top of the frosting and the cupcake, then tightly wrap the entire thing in plastic wrap.

, Place the packaged cupcakes in your freezer and use them within two or three months.


Under the right conditions, some unfrosted cupcakes may last for up to six months, but leaving them in your freezer for that long is not recommended.

, Roughly two or three hours before planning to eat the cupcake, remove it from the freezer and place it in your refrigerator. During the last 30 minutes, remove the cupcake from the refrigerator and let it continue thawing on the kitchen counter or table.


Alternatively, you can skip the refrigerator and thaw the cupcake entirely at room temperature. Pull it out of the freezer one to two hours before you intend to eat it when using this option.
Loosen or remove any wrappings once the cupcake sits out on the countertop. Doing so should help prevent condensation from building.

Place the eggplant in an unsealed bag.,
Keep the eggplant in the crisper drawer.,
Remove other produce from the drawer.,
Use within seven days.",How to Store Eggplant2," Place the whole, uncut eggplant in a perforated plastic bag, open plastic bag, or open plastic container.If desired, you could loosely wrap the eggplant in paper towels or paper bags before placing them into the plastic container. The paper should help absorb moisture from the eggplant, slowing decay as a result.
Do not seal the plastic bag or use plastic film to wrap the eggplant. Sealed plastic will restrict air flow to the vegetable, which may cause it to lose its freshness at a faster pace.

, Place the eggplant in the crisper drawer of your refrigerator.


If you cannot easily fit the eggplant in the crisper drawer, do not attempt to force it in since doing so could tear the skin and cause the flesh to spoil. You can simply sit the eggplant on another shelf inside the refrigerator.

, If possible, remove other fruits and vegetables from the crisper drawer while storing the eggplant.


Many fruits and vegetables produce ethylene gas. When eggplant comes into contact with these gases, it ripens and decays at a faster pace.

, Use refrigerated eggplant within three to seven days, if possible.Refrigerators are too cold for eggplants, so the resulting texture and color may change during refrigeration, even if you follow the procedure correctly. If you can use the eggplant within one or two days, room temperature storage is best.

Cut the eggplant into slices.,
Blanch the eggplant in boiling water.,
Cool the eggplant in ice water.,
Place the eggplant in plastic bags.,
Use within six months.",How to Store Eggplant3," Using a sharp knife, cut the eggplant into 1/3-inch (8.5-mm) thick coins or slices.


It's a good idea to rinse the eggplant under cool, running water before slicing it. If you don't clean it, surface contamination can get onto the knife and onto the flesh of the eggplant.
You may also peel the skin of the eggplant using a standard vegetable peeler, but doing so is not necessary.

, Fill a large saucepan with water and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook the eggplant in the boiling water for four minutes.Begin timing as soon as you place the eggplant in the boiling water. Do not wait for the water to begin boiling again if it slows down.
You only need to blanch the eggplant; do not cook it completely. Blanching the eggplant destroys enzymes that could otherwise ruin the flavor and texture of the vegetable while it sits in your freezer.

, Use a slotted spoon to immediately transfer the blanched eggplant to a large bowl of ice water. Allow the eggplant to sit in the ice water for five minutes, or until it feels cold to the touch.


Rapidly cooling the eggplant can prevent it from overcooking.
After cooling the eggplant, drain the ice water and pat the slices dry with clean paper towels.

, Transfer the eggplant slices to a large, freezer-safe plastic bag. Remove as much air as possible from the bag before sealing it.


To prolong the lifespan of the eggplant, consider using vacuum-sealed bags instead of ordinary plastic bags.
If you want to prevent the eggplant from sticking together as it freezes, you'll need to wrap each slice in a small sheet of plastic wrap before placing all of the slices into the same bag.

, Place the bag of eggplant slices in your freezer. Defrost and use the eggplant within six to nine months.


If you vacuum-seal the bags and store them in a deep freeze, the eggplant may last as long as 14 months.
The freezing process will rupture some of the cell walls, causing the eggplant to become notably softer. This shouldn't be much of a problem if you plan to use the vegetable in a dish calling for tender eggplant, though.

Cover the cut side of the lemon.,
Refrigerate.,
Freeze slices to add to drinks.",How to Store Lemons2," Reduce water loss and oxidization by protecting the cut side from air. Here are a few ways to do this:


Place lemon halves cut-side-down on a small plate.
Wrap wedges or slices in plastic wrap.
Place the cut lemons in the smallest airtight container you can find.

, Although they last longer than most other cut fruit, lemons are still best within 2–3 days of cutting.

, Freeze the slices on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spaced out so they don't touch each other. Once frozen, toss them all in a sealed plastic bag and store in the freezer indefinitely.


Freezing lemons (or any food items) on a baking sheet prevents them sticking to each other as ice forms.
Like most fruit, lemons become mushy when frozen. The frozen slices are best added to cold drinks directly from the freezer, while they're still hard.

Refrigerate lemon juice.,
Freeze leftover juice in ice cube trays.,
Store zest in an airtight container.,
Freeze leftover zest.",How to Store Lemons3," Despite its acidity, lemon juice can harbor bacteria if kept at room temperature. After about 2–4 days in the refrigerator, the juice will start to lose its taste. Throw it out once it looks dull and dark or loses most of its taste, usually about 7–10 days.Do not store lemon juice in transparent bottles, since light will break down the juice more quickly.
Store-bought bottled lemon juice typically contains preservatives, which increase its shelf life to several months.

, This is the easiest way to freeze excess juice. Once frozen, transfer to a sealed plastic bag in the freezer.


Alternatively, can the lemon juice instead.

, Once you've zested the lemon, move the zest to an airtight glass container. Store in a cool, dry location.Freshly grated zest loses flavor fast, and may become a bacterial risk after just 2–3 days., If you have a great deal of zest, space small, tightly packed spoonfuls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Freeze, then transfer to a freezer-safe container.

Keep the cap or lid on the oil bottle when you are not using it.,
Store the oil in a dark-colored glass bottle with a tight-fitting cap.,
Avoid using plastic bottles.,
Avoid keeping cooking oils in containers made from iron or copper.,
Consider transferring some oil into a smaller container to make it easier to pour.",How to Store Cooking Oil1," One of the main causes of oil turning rancid is exposure to too much oxygen. When you are not using the oil, keep the cap or lid on the container.;
, Even if the oil comes in a clear, glass bottle, consider transferring it to a blue or green one. Sunlight degrades the quality of oil, and a dark-colored bottle will help to keep that from happening. Use a funnel to help guide the oil into the new bottle without spillage.


Brown colored glass is not recommended because it lets in too much light.If you own more than one type of oil, don't forget to label the bottles.
You can reuse dark-colored wine and vinegar bottles.You can buy dark-colored bottles from a cooking equipment store., Plastic tends to leach chemicals over time.When this happens, it will affect the overall taste of the oil.If your oil came in a plastic bottle, consider transferring it to a glass bottle or jar with a tight-fitting lid.

, These metals create a chemical reaction when they come in contact with oil and make it unsafe to use., Some oils come in a large bottle or tin. These are often heavy and difficult to move. You can make use of this oil easier by transferring a small amount of the oil into a dark-colored glass bottle (see above for suggestions).


Pour the oil out from the bottle when you are ready to use it.
When the small bottle becomes empty, refill it with more oil from the larger container. The smaller bottle will be a lot easier to manage than that large, heavy tin or bottle."

Be familiar with which types of oils can be stored at room temperature.,
Store the oil in a cool, dark cupboard or pantry.,
Know which types of oils are best stored in the refrigerator.,
Know which oils can be stored at both room temperature or in the fridge.,
Avoid storing oil where it can be damaged.",How to Store Cooking Oil2," The following types of oils can be kept at room temperature:Ghee oil can last for several months.
Palm oil can last for several months.
Peanut oil (refined) will last for two years.
Vegetable oil can last for a year or longer as long as it is tightly covered.
Olive oil may be kept in the cupboard (at temperatures between 57°F and 70ºF (14°C and 21ºC) for up to 15 months.

, Do not store it near or above the stove. The frequent temperature changes will cause the oil to deteriorate.

, Some oils will spoil if they are not kept in a cold place. Refrigeration will cause most oils to turn cloudy and thick. Because of this, you will need to take the oil out one to two hours before you need it, and let it sit at room temperature, allowing the oil to return to its usual consistency. The following oils should be kept in the fridge:Avocado oil will last for 9 to 12 months.
Corn oil will last up to 6 months.
Mustard oil will last 5 to 6 months.
Safflower oil will last for 6 months.
Sesame oil will last for 6 months.
Truffle oil will last for 6 months.

, Some oils can be kept either in the fridge or in the cupboard. However, in most cases, refrigeration will prolong the oil's shelf life. Note that refrigeration will cause some oils to turn thick and cloudy. If this happens, take the oil out of the fridge one to two hours before you need it, allowing it to return to its usual consistency. The one exception to this is coconut oil, which is solid at room temperature. The following oils can be kept either in the fridge or in a cool, dark cupboard:Canola oil can be stored in the cupboard for 4 to 6 months, or in the fridge for 9 months.
Chili oil can be stored in the cupboard for 6 months. It will last longer in the fridge.
Coconut oil can be stored in the cupboard for months. It can last longer in the fridge but is difficult to use quickly from the refrigerator.
Grapeseed oil can be stored in the cupboard for 3 months (up to 70ºF/21ºC), or in the fridge for 6 months.
Hazelnut oil can be stored in the cupboard for 3 months. It will last in the fridge for up to 6 months.
Depending on the type, lard can be stored either in the cupboard or in the fridge. Read the label for proper storing techniques.
Macadamia nut oil can be stored in the cupboard for up to two years. It can last even longer in the fridge.
Palm kernel oil can be stored in the cupboard for up to a year. It can last longer in the fridge.
Walnut oil can be stored in the cupboard for 3 months. It will last in the fridge for up to 6 months.

, Sunlight and frequent temperature changes can deteriorate oil and cause it to go rancid. Unfortunately, some of the most popular places to keep oil, such as windowsills and on the counter, are often the worst because the oil is subjected to too much sunlight and changes in temperature. Avoid keeping your oil in the places listed below, even if the oil can be kept at room temperature:Windowsills
The back ledge of a stove
In a cabinet above the stove
Next to the stove or oven
On the counter
Next to the refrigerator (the external side of a fridge can get quite hot through a cupboard partition)
Near cooking appliances such as kettles, waffle makers and toasters.

Be aware that oil stays fresh for a short duration only.,
Sniff the oil every few months.,
Pay attention to the taste.,
Take note of how the oil was stored before it went bad.,
Do not pour oil down the drain.",How to Store Cooking Oil3," When shopping for oil, you may notice two different types: refined and unrefined. Refined oils have been processed, and usually have little taste or nutritional value. Unrefined oils tend to be more pure, and are packed with nutrients. The label on the bottle or jar will tell you whether the oil is refined or unrefined. Here is how long you can expect both types of oils to last:Refined oils will usually last 6 to 12 months if stored in a cool, dark cupboard (or fridge, if necessary).
Unrefined oils will usually for 3 to 6 months if stored in a cool, dark, cupboard. A refrigerator is the best place to keep these oils.

, If it smells bad or has a slight odor of wine, the oil has gone rancid. Toss the oil out., If the oil tastes metallic, a little bit like wine, or just plain bad, it has likely gone bad, turned rancid, or oxidized., This might help you to understand why it went bad. Once you've figured out the reason, avoid making the same mistake when storing the next bottle of oil. Here are some things to look for when dealing with rancid oil:


Check the expiration date: If the oil has gone bad because you didn't use it in time, get a smaller bottle the next time you go shopping.
Was it was stored in a plastic container?: Some types of plastic leach into the oil and cause it to taste bad.
Was it stored in a metal container?: Some metals, such as copper an iron, are reactive. They create a chemical reaction when they come in contact with oil and give it a metallic taste. Oils should never be stored in such containers.
Consider where it was stored: Some oils need to be kept in the fridge while others need to be kept in a cool, dark cabinet. Oils should be kept out of places that receive too much sunlight or are subjected to fluctuating temperatures.
How was it stored?: Was the cap on the container whenever the oil was not in use? Oil can go bad if it oxidizes.

, This is especially important if the oil is usually solid at room temperature. It may seem like a quick and convenient way to get rid of used oil, but it will only result in a clogged drain. The best way to get rid of used oil is to pour it into a leak-proof container, such as a jar or zippered plastic bag, and then to throw the container into the trashcan."

Store unopened dip.,
Keep opened mayonnaise cool.,
Refrigerate salad dressings.,
Keep pasta sauces in the refrigerator.,
Include ketchup and mustard.,
Store nut oils.,
Include jams and jellies.",How to Store Condiments1," Dips are made with eggs, so they will spoil outside the refrigerator even while unopened. Any fresh-made condiments, particularly those made with eggs and dairy, have to be kept cold at all times.


When in doubt, err on the side of caution and refrigerate.;
, Store-bought mayonnaise is fine outside the refrigerator until it is opened. Once it is opened, bacteria accumulates and the product spoils within a day at room temperature. Properly covered and stored mayonnaise will last at least two months., All opened dressings spoil outside the refrigerator. Ranch dressing includes dairy. Others, such as Italian, include vegetables and fruit juices. Keep it cool and a bottle of dressing will last at least a month., All pasta sauces are made with some combination of vegetables and other products that spoil, such as dairy. Contain them after cooking and put them in the refrigerator. They will last six months but can be frozen for longer.This includes other fruit and vegetable-made sauces such as marinades, barbecue, and cocktail sauces.

, Standard bottles of these condiments contain enough preservatives that they can be left outside the refrigerator. However, keeping them inside lengthens their shelf life. These will stay good when cold at least a month. Ask yourself how much you will use the condiment before you leave it out.Other mustards than standard yellow, including dijon, preserve their flavor better when refrigerated.

, Unlike other cooking oils, oils made from nuts, including almond and sesame oil, should be kept cool after opening. Nut products don’t have many preservatives and the oils can separate, causing the product to turn rancid. These will last six months when stored.Natural peanut butters also need to be stored in the refrigerator due to their oils.

, Many homemade jams and jellies are sealed in containers and left out of the refrigerator. It is also possible to do this with store-bought product too, since the included sugar has a preservative effect. Still, it’s best to be safe and refrigerate, ensuring the product lasts at least six months."

Keep condiments in a cool, dark place.,
Put butter in a dish.,
Hide your oils.,
Store fermented sauces.,
Shelve hot sauce.,
Leave out honey.,
Include non-natural peanut butter.",How to Store Condiments2," Most condiments can be stored in a place such as a pantry or cupboard. Move them away from heat and water sources to a location where the temperature stays cool. Keep them away from direct sunlight., Butter can actually be stored at room temperature. Butter is not considered a Temperature Control for Safety food by the U.S. government. It has less lactose than other dairy products, so it doesn’t spoil. Cover it in a dish and it will stay spreadable and bacteria-free.Alternatively, store it in the refrigerator to ensure freshness and give butter a longer shelf life.

, Several oils don’t benefit much from refrigeration. Olive oil for example lasts as long in the pantry as it does in the refrigerator. However, it needs to be kept away from heat and direct sunlight. Make sure it has a cool, shady place in the back of the pantry and it will last about a year.Vegetable oils also aren’t affected by room temperatures.
Coconut oil also benefits outside the pantry, as it solidifies when cooled.

, The fermentation process used to make fish and soy sauce prevent them from degrading enough to spoil. When opened, these products can be kept on the shelf for a year without much loss in quality.


You can still store them in the refrigerator to maximize shelf life and freshness., Hot sauce is made with plenty of salt and vinegar, which serve as preservatives. An opened bottle of hot sauce will last you two months. If you know you won’t be able to use the sauce in that amount of time, put it in the refrigerator where it will last six months., Honey changes color over time as it begins to crystallize, but it does not spoil. It does not need to be refrigerated. Place the honey on a counter to minimize discoloration and use it as needed., Ordinary peanut butter survives fine outside the refrigerator. Natural peanut butter and other nut butters have oils that spoil the product. As long as the container is closed, the peanut butter will stay spreadable and fresh for three months.The exception to this is when someone sticks a dirty knife or finger in the jar. This introduces bacteria. If a child or someone else who will do this is around, keep the peanut butter in the refrigerator.

Refrigerate the condiment in a sealed container.,
Add whey.,
Freeze sauces.",How to Store Condiments3," Within about two hours of making the condiment, move it into an airtight container such as a plastic bin or a mason jar. Because these condiments are made fresh and without preservatives, the organic products, including fruits, vegetables, and dairy, will begin to attract bacteria and spoil in open air.Condiments that will be used within a week can be kept in the refrigerator.
It is also possible to keep your condiments usable by storing them in a cool, dark, and dry space such as a pantry.

, Whey is a preservative you can make at home and use to extend the lifespan of your condiments. Strain a product such as organic yogurt, then add a couple of tablespoons to your jarred condiment and let it sit out for a couple of days. Now you can refrigerate it and use it as you please., A popular trick in home cooking is to pre-make your food during the week and store it until you’re ready to use it. You can do this with condiments such as spaghetti sauce and gravy. Put them in an airtight container such as a plastic or sealed bags, then thaw them out when you’re ready to use them.Condiments last indefinitely when frozen but lose freshness after several months.

Choose containers that are air and water tight.,
Check directions on food labels.,
Store in clean containers, or don’t open.,
Create a climate-controlled and stable storage area.,
Keep non-frozen food in a cool and dry location.,
Maintain a constant temperature and humidity.,
Check your food from time to time.,
Maintain your refrigerator or freezer.,
Set your refrigerator or freezer to the right temperature.,
Inspect your food often.,
Beware of power outages.",How to Store Food So That It Lasts Longer," One of the best ways to preserve food for a long time is to make sure that whatever it is sealed in is completely air and water tight. By having air and water tight containers, you’ll keep contaminants out and limit environmental changes that may spoil your food.


Consider glass jars.
Think about canning food as a solution to preservation.
For refrigerated or frozen food, consider air tight plastic ware that is cold resistant.;
, Another important thing you need to do to store food appropriately is to check directions on food labels. Food labels will provide recommended conditions so that your food lasts as long as possible.


Check “use-by” dates.
Pay attention to directions about cooling or freezing foods.
Make sure to know if meat or dairy are present in your food – this could decrease the amount of time until the food spoils.

, One important step to take is to store food in clean containers. In addition, if food is unopened in its original container, you should keep it shut. Storing food in a clean and/or unopened container will minimize the ability of bacteria to grow and spoil the food.


Wash all containers and utensils with scalding hot water.
Use detergent or antibacterial soap to wash your utensils and containers.
Beware of dangers when using hot water or detergents. Protect your eyes and avoid burning yourself or others around you., The most important thing in storing food outside of a refrigerator or freezer is making sure that the climate is stable. By limiting temperature and humidity variations and creating optimal conditions for food, you’ll slow the rate at which it spoils.


Make sure your food storage area is away from any leaky pipes or any other sources of moisture. Moisture may increase the chance of fungal spores growing or increase the humidity of the storage area – putting your food at risk.
Make sure your food storage area is between 50 degrees to 70 degrees. Avoid placing your food storage area next to a source of heat, like an oven.
Think about storing your food in cupboards, cellars, or pantries free from temperature swings and moisture., Non-frozen food like canned or jarred food should be kept in a cool and dry location. By keeping food in a suitable location, you’ll extend its shelf life and reduce the risk of mold, mildew, or bacteria from spoiling it.


Make sure the relative humidity of the storage location remains low and constant.
Avoid storing food in an area where there might be a leaky pipe or something that can introduce water., You should also make sure that you’re keeping a constant temperature and humidity wherever you store your food. This is because temperature and humidity swings may increase the rate at which your food spoils.


Check the temperature in your storage areas from time to time.
If you don’t have one already, install a device that will monitor temperature and humidity.
If your temperature varies more than 5 or 10 degrees over the course of a day, you should take steps to improve your storage area. This might include adding insulation to a dry storage area., In order to make sure that you are safely and successfully storing food, you should check it from time-to-time. By checking your food, you’ll see if your storage system is working properly.


Inspect canned, jarred, or dried foods in your pantry or other storage area. Depending on the type of food, you should take account of food in a non-refrigerated storage area every month or two.
Make sure use-by dates are still good, make sure no containers are leaking, and make sure there have been no water pipe leaks introducing water into your pantry., Providing proper maintenance to your appliances is extremely important in storing your food. By providing maintenance, you’ll make sure that your appliances maintain a stable temperature, keep moisture out, and keep pests out.


Make sure your insulation and rubber stripping on your refrigerator and/or freezer is working. If your rubber stripping is broken or brittle, you’ll lose cool air, make your unit work harder, and may allow moisture and pests to get in.
Check coolant levels every year. To check your coolant level, locate the coolant chamber on the back of your refrigerator or freezer. Remove the cap and see if it is full -- the liquid should be apparent as you open it. If it is not full, refill it. If you are concerned there is a leak because it needs to be refilled often, contact someone to service your appliance.
Make sure there are no water leaks or mechanical problems with your appliances., Setting your appliances to the right temperature will help ensure that your food is safe and lasts long. Ultimately, if the temperature is too warm or too cold, your food will spoiler quicker.


Freezers should be set at 0 degrees Fahrenheit or lower.
Refrigerators should be set between 33 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit.
Inspect your refrigerators or freezers regularly to make sure they are performing properly., While you may think that food stored in a refrigerator or freezer does not need to be checked on, the opposite is true. In fact, this food is more susceptible to problems since temperature variations can have a severe impact on the safety or quality of food.


Check frozen food every month. Inspect use-by dates, feel the food to see if it has thawed and has refrozen, and see if any of your storage containers have leaked.
Check refrigerated food every week. Look at use-by dates, see if any food has begun to spoil, and see if any of your containers have spilled or leaked., Power outages are one of the biggest threats to your ability to store food for a long time in a refrigerator or freezer. As a result, you should always monitor your food during or after a power outage.


Don’t open your refrigerator or freezer during a power outage.
Invest in a power backup system or a generator if you are in an area with frequent or prolonged power outages.
Frozen or refrigerated food that is exposed to temperatures of higher than 40 degrees for several hours might be compromised."

Check all citrus fruits for ripeness.,
Purchase fresh citrus.,
Pick your own fruit.",How to Store Citrus Fruit1," Fruit that is over ripened will deteriorate quickly as it has already released much of the chemicals that cause the fruit to break down. Fruit that is under ripened will not have developed all of its sweetness, nutritional value and juice content. Properly ripened fruit will keep longer.


Unlike other fruits, citrus fruits do not continue to ripen once they have been picked. So it is important that they be ripe right off of the tree.Ripened fruit will have very bright and vibrant colors. A fully ripened citrus fruit will have reached the fullness of its color. Dull looking fruit can indicate over ripeness and oranges with an abundance of greenish skin can mean that the fruit is under ripened.
A bit of green on the skin of oranges and lemons is perfectly fine. These tend to keep the longest and will be perfect for storing.;
, Once a fruit has been picked, it gradually begins to break down. Much of the fruit in grocery stores have already been transported and stored for a week or more. Your best bet is to obtain the fruit as soon as possible after it has been harvested.


Farmers markets, as well as other markets that sell locally harvested produce tend to offer fresher citrus fruits due to the fact that they are often delivered straight from the harvest.

, If you are picking the fruit from the tree yourself, properly ripened fruit should be easily clipped from the tree with very little resistance. Any struggle to pull the fruit from the tree means that it isn’t quite ready to pick. By determining its freshness right from the tree, you will stand a good chance at finding the ideal fruit for storage.

Store them in the refrigerator.,
Keep them on the counter.,
Keep them dry.",How to Store Citrus Fruit2," Oranges tend to preserve best at cooler temperatures and deteriorate quickly at warmer temperatures. Keeping them refrigerated will slow down the deterioration process and will help to maintain freshness for an extended period of time.Using a mesh or otherwise well-ventilated bag will keep the air circulating around the fruit. This will help to prolong the occurrence of mold, lesions or softened produce.
Store them in your refrigerator’s vegetable bin and be sure to rotate the fruit regularly to maintain airflow.
Oranges stored in a refrigerator should keep for approximately one month.

, Oranges kept on a kitchen counter or a table will remain fresh for up to one week at room temperature, depending on how fresh they were to begin with.If your room temperature tends to be on the warmer side, try keeping the home cooler, or placing the fruit bowl into the fridge at night.


Do not cover the bowl with plastic wrap or foil. Airflow is important to keeping oranges fresh.

, Damp oranges that have been stored may quickly become moldy. Ensure that there is no moistness or water droplets on the skin of the fruit.


If they arrive damp, so be sure to towel dry and air them out before storing.

Store them on the counter.,
Put them into your refrigerator’s vegetable bin.,
Freeze your grapefruit.",How to Store Citrus Fruit3," Grapefruit is best stored in a bowl on the counter if you intend to eat them within the first week. Due to its heaviness, the grapefruit does bruise easily, so be sure to stack them evenly., If you plan to keep your grapefruit for up to 3-4 weeks, be sure to store them in a low-humidity crisper drawer.Similar to oranges, grapefruit should be placed into a mesh or otherwise well-ventilated storage bag. Grapefruit need good air circulation to prevent perspiration and moldy conditions. Be sure to rotate them twice per week.

, Peel and freeze them whole, or in sections inside of Ziploc freezer bags or Tupperware. Frozen grapefruit will keep up to six months.

Freeze them.",How to Store Citrus Fruit4," This is considered the best method which preserves fresh lemons for up to four weeks and will also retain their juiciness during that time., Lemons will remain fresh for approximately 5-7 days when left at room temperature. After that time, they will begin to lose moisture, dry out and harden., Lemons can be cut into quarters, with all membranes and seeds removed. Place them into plastic bags and freeze. Use them within three months as the longer they are stored, the more bitter they become.If you regularly use lemon slices for water or tea, you can freeze lemon slices by laying them out on a cookie sheet and setting them in the freezer for a few hours. Once they are solid, place them into a ziploc storage bag."

Use frozen lime juice to preserve guacamole or any other dishes with avocado to keep it from spoiling.
Frozen lemon juice can be added to fish before baking for a delicious citrusy taste.
Frozen orange juice popsicles are a great way for kids to get their much-needed serving of vitamin C.

, Pickling is a great way to preserve and even enhance the taste of citrus fruit. Oranges, lemons and limes are often packed into an airtight jar and are pickled using salt and water.


Rinse the lemons and dry them before you begin. Using a shape knife, make a lengthwise cut in the lemon. You do not want to cut all the way through — your aim is to create slits into which you can pack salt and spices, not to chop the lemon up. Make four incisions like this.Fill the sliced openings with Kosher, pickling or sea salt at about one tablespoon per lemon. Put the lemon into a clean quart-sized Mason jar. Continue to add salted lemons until the the jar is almost full, mashing them down so they fit.At this point you may add some spices and/or herbs such as cinnamon, cloves or bay leaves.
Seal the jars tightly and wait at least 3 weeks before eating they can be kept up to 6 months
Pickled fruit is usually paired with fish, in salads and with rice., Canning can preserve citrus fruits for up to nine months.A quart jar can hold the segments of about 3 large oranges or 4 lemons.


To can a citrus fruit, remove peel, seeds and membrane from the fruit and break the fruit up by its segments (pieces).Bring to a boil six cups of water, along with sugar, sugar syrup or fruit juice.
Fill your up your jar with the citrus fruit.
Once the mixture has come to a boil, carefully pour it into the jar, over the fruit. Do not allow the mixture to cool before pouring.
Seal the jar and submerge it in a hot, boiling water bath for 10 minutes.
After boiling, lift the jar from the water and allow it to cool.

",How to Prepare Spinach," Browse the spinach section at the store or farmer's market for bunches with dark green, fresh leaves. Don't get a bunch with yellow, wilted, bruised, or mushy leaves.It's important to select fresh spinach so that it can last long enough to be part of a tasty meal. At the grocery store, most of the spinach you find will already be separated from its stems and will be in a sealed bag. At the farmer's market, most spinach will come in a nice leafy bunch.


The most common type of spinach is smooth-leafed spinach, which has flat, smooth leaves that are perfect for cleaning.Savoy spinach handles the cold better than other types of spinach. Its leaves are deeply crinkled, making it harder to wash the soil and grit away from the leaves.
Baby spinach is simply spinach that is plucked after 15-20 days of growth while regular spinach is plucked after 45-60 days of growth. Baby spinach has more tender leaves and is better used in salads, while adult spinach is better for cooking.;
, It can be stored this way for 3 days.If you've purchased the type of spinach in a sealed bag, make sure that you keep it closed tight with a clip after you've opened it so that the remaining spinach remains fresh. If you don't plan on using it right away, then you should store it until you're ready to use it. You shouldn't wash or dry it until you're ready to cook it, or it will wilt.

, If your spinach is still attached to its thick stems, then you should cut off the stems using a knife or kitchen shears. You can use a paring knife for extra accuracy. Though the stems are still edible, they're a little tough and unpleasant to the taste, and your spinach leaves will be tastier without them.

, Many times, spinach has dirt in it that can make it taste gritty. If you purchased spinach in a bag that is sealed and states that it's been washed, then you can still wash it to be safe, but you don't have to take as many precautions as you would with spinach from the market. Here's how you can go about washing the spinach:


Separate the leaves.
Run your hand down the rib to separate the leafy bit from the stem. This is optional. Some people like to eat the stems.
Put the leaves into a bowl of water, swish them around, and drain the water.
Repeat until all soil has been removed.

, You should wait for your spinach to dry before cooking it — unless you're boiling it anyway. You can toss it in a colander and then leave it out for 10 minutes and wait for it to dry or you can even gently pat it with paper towels. Just make sure you do this carefully so you don't end up mushing the spinach together. Once it's dry, you should start cooking it as soon as you can to avoid having it wilt.

, One of the easiest ways to cook your spinach is to simply boil it. You can boil it and enjoy it on its own, or boil it as a first step to creaming it. Here's all you have to do to boil your spinach:Place the spinach in a large pot of boiling water.
Cook it for 3-5 minutes.
Drain.
Place it in ice water to ""shock"" it and give it a nice green color and then drain it again (optional).
Place it in a serving dish and gently drizzle it with olive oil.
Add salt and pepper to taste.

, Sauteing is one of the most common methods of cooking spinach. All you need to do it besides 2 bunches of spinach is some olive oil, 2 cloves of sliced garlic (optional), and salt and pepper to taste. Here's what you should do:Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat.
Add the garlic and cook it for about 30 seconds, or until it's fragrant.
Add one bunch of spinach and cook it for one minutes, until begins to wilt. Turn it with tongs as you cook it.
Add the other bunch of spinach and continue cooking it for 2-3 minutes until all of the spinach is wilted.
Season it with salt and pepper to taste.

, Creaming spinach is an excellent way to make your spinach dish more rich, hearty, and delicious. You can enjoy this dish on its own or serve it with steak, chicken, or another protein of your choice. You'll need the following ingredients: 24 ounces of spinach, 1 stick of butter, 8 tablespoons of flour, 1/2 diced medium onion, 3 minced cloves of garlic, 2 cups of milk, and salt and pepper to taste. Here's what you need to do to cream spinach:Melt one stick of butter in a heavy pot.
Sprinkle the flour into the butter and whisk the ingredients together.
Cook the flour and butter over medium heat for five minutes.
Add the diced onion and minced garlic and stir the ingredients together for 1 more minute.
Pour in the milk and whisk the ingredients continuously for another 5 minutes.
Sautée the spinach in a separate pan. Follow instructions for sauteing above (without the additional garlic).
Season the cream sauce with salt and pepper to taste and add the spinach to it.
Stir the spinach and cream sauce gently until you've fully combined them.

, Baked spinach, like creamed spinach, is another rich and hearty preparation method for spinach. This method also has the bonus of rich, cheesy goodness. Here are all the ingredients you'll need to make it: 1/2 cup chopped onion, 2 tablespoons of butter, 2 packages of spinach, 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream, 1/3 cup milk, 5 divided tablespoons of shredded Parmesan cheese, 1/4 cup dry bread crumbs, and salt and pepper to taste. Here's how you bake it:Sautée the onion in butter for 2-3 minutes, until the onion is tender.
Stir in the spinach, milk, and cream.
Remove from heat.
Stir in 4 tablespoons of cheese, bread crumbs, and salt and pepper.
Spoon the mixture into a greased 1 quart baking dish.
Sprinkle it with the remaining cheese.
Bake the spinach uncovered at 350°F (176°C) for 40-45 minutes or until the cheese is lightly browned.

, A spinach and strawberry salad is a simple and nutritious dish that doesn't require you to cook the spinach at all. All you need are the following ingredients: 1 package of spinach, 10 fresh strawberries, 1/2 cup slivered almonds, 1/2 chopped medium red onion, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and salt and pepper to taste. Here's all you need to do to make it:


Chop the red onion.
Quarter the strawberries.
Toss the onion, strawberries, almonds, and spinach together.
Mix 1/4 cup balsamic, 1/4 cup olive oil, 3 tablespoons of sugar, and salt and pepper to taste to make dressing.
Pour the dressing over the salad and gently toss it.

, This sweet salad is perfect for a summer afternoon, a picnic, or as a side dish for any meal. All you have to do is combine 1 package of spinach, 1/2 cup of crumbled or diced feta cheese, 10-15 quartered figs, 1/2 cup of pecans, and 1 cup of grapes. Add some simple balsamic dressing, or a raspberry vinaigrette if you're feeling fancy, and your salad is all done — no cooking necessary!

, Spinach can add a healthy, delicious flavor to any vegetable or fruit smoothie. In general, all you have to do to make a smoothie with spinach is to add spinach as well as whatever other ingredients you'd like to use to a blender and blend them until they're smooth. Here are some ingredients you can use to make a spinach and pear smoothie:1 1/2 cups water or coconut water
2 cups spinach
1 chopped ripe pear
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 teaspoon grated ginger
1 tablespoon ground flaxseed
1 teaspoon honey

Consider first the impact you want to make.,
Consider the way it has an effect.,
Consider how the garnish will be eaten.,
Consider the flavour.,
Consider these options:


Lemon, orange or lime slices or half slices, wedges, segments and zest.,
Think about making layers of food.,
Experiment with tools such as peelers, zesters, melon ballers, apple core cutters, cookie cutters and other tools you have at home.

,
Consider other effect type garnishes.

,
Take note of garnishes when you go out for a meal, or read a food magazine and see if you can duplicate it for cooking for your friends or family.

,
Consider going to a cooking class for more information.

",How to Prepare Good Garnishes," Thinking about what you can do and how to do it is the most important factor and virtually anything edible can be a garnish.;
, Food is very sense orientated so would your garnish add:


Visual impact (be it shape, colour, visual texture such as shiny or dull or finally its size)
Flavour impact (such chopped herbs or ground spices)
Scent impact (such as orange or lemon zest, fragrant herbs or garlic butter)
Texture impact (such as crispy croutons on a soup)
Or can it give a mix?

, The aim of the game is to get the garnish to both improve the meal, but also be part of the meal.

, If it doesn't taste good with the meal, there is little point to it. If it adds to, or compliments the flavours then you are going well, but incompatible flavours (such as fried crispy garlic on a dessert) or inedible garnishes could destroy a perfectly cooked meal.

, Even the juice can be used as an aromatic if dappled around the edge of the plate or used in a dressing.
Chopped herbs such as parsley, basil, oregano
A sprinkling or a small bunch of stronger herbs, such as rosemary, sage, thyme or lemon grass.
Think about shapes. Fruits and vegetables can be cut into thin strips, slices, flowers or other shapes, and some twist interestingly (such as thin carrot shreds or slices of green spring onion leaf) when placed into iced water. Chocolate melted into a thin layer and set, as well as pastry, fondant and other moldable ingredients are easy to make shapes from.
For making vegetable fans, avocado, strawberries, gherkins, mango and cucumbers may be fanned easily. The simplest method for large items such as cucumber is cut them in half lengthwise, then making even cuts also lengthwise (not across the vegetable like normal slices), almost to the end, but leaving the product whole. Then using a flat knife, press gently on the sliced product applying pressure at an angle to fan out the slices.
Gelatin products also make a fine basis or garnish. By mixing a heated flavoured liquid such as a savoury clear beef stock, herb infusion (much like making a tea) or sweet syrups, with ordinary gelatin (the pack would give a ratio of how much to add as the products do vary). They can be clear, coloured or opaque (with adding cream), poured onto a plate and chilled on the fridge to look like a clear mirror like lake, set in a mould or cut into cubes, diamonds etc to look like jewels.
Bread makes a wide variety of garnishes, cubed, cut in diamonds or triangles (etc), shredded and these then fried or toasted in a low oven for colour, flavour and crispness. They can also be seasoned with cheese, spices, and over flavourings.

, While you should aim to be conservative, layers can make a clever impact with no or minimal extra ingredients required.

Place the clementines in an open container.,
Keep them away from direct sunlight.Place the clementines on counter or table that does not receive much, if any, direct sunlight.,
Store for two to seven days.",How to Store Clementines1," A basket or wire mesh container works best, but any container with an open top will be suitable. Wooden crates with open slits along the side work great, as well.


Do not place the fruit in a sealed container. Cutting off air circulation could hasten the spoiling process, causing the clementines to become moldy or rotten quicker. Storing the fruit in a container that lets more air flow through will minimize this effect.;
, Cooler temperatures and low humidity are also preferred conditions.


Sunlight, warmth, and humidity are all factors that help clementines ripen. With ripe clementines, however, these conditions cause the fruit to over-ripen faster.

, When stored at room temperature, most clementines will last up to two or three days.If the fruit was in excellent condition starting out and the conditions of the room are ideal, you may even be able to store the clementines in this manner for a full week.

"
"
Arrange the clementines in a mesh bag.,
Place the fruit inside the crisper drawer of the refrigerator.,
Periodically sort through the clementines.,
Store for one to two weeks.",How to Store Clementines2," If possible, place all of the clementines inside a plastic mesh bag. Loosely twist the top opening of the bag closed to prevent the fruit from spilling out.


While convention recommends storing clementines in plastic bags or airtight containers, doing so could actually cause the fruit to become moldy or soft much quicker. Mesh bags allow air to circulate around all sides of the fruit, thereby minimizing the threat of mold.Strictly speaking, you do not need to place the fruit in a mesh bag when you store it as long as you keep it in the right part of your refrigerator. The bag keeps things tidy and prevents bruising and other similar damage, but you do not need to worry too much if you cannot find a mesh bag to use.

, Regardless of whether or not you have bagged the clementines, you should place them inside the crisper drawer, also called the “fruit drawer” or “vegetable drawer,” of your refrigerator.


The humidity level inside the refrigerator's crisper drawer is different than it is inside the rest of your refrigerator. You may not be able to control the humidity, but if there is a control dial on the drawer, set it to “low” to help prevent the fruit from getting moldy.

, Look through the clementines every one or two days and remove any that appear to be going bad early.


If the fruit is just beginning to get soft, you should use it that day. Fruit that has gotten too soft or has begun to decay should be discarded, though.
You should separate fruit that has already gotten overripe from fruit that is still fresh. Overripe fruit releases a gas that speeds ripening in other, nearby fruit, so your remaining clementines will spoil faster if you keep a rotten one mixed in with the rest of the bunch.

, When stored in this manner, most clementines will last anywhere between one or two full weeks. You might be able to get a few extra days out of them past this if the conditions and fruit are both ideal, but it is somewhat uncommon, so you should exercise more caution when consuming clementines that are more than two weeks old.

Peel and separate the clementines.,
Arrange the slices in freezer-safe containers.,
Make a simple syrup on the stove.,
Pour the syrup over the clementines.,
Freeze for 10 to 12 months.",How to Store Clementines3," Remove the peel from each clementine and separate the fruit into its natural segments. Peel away as much of the white membrane as possible from these segments and remove any seeds you find.


Before peeling the clementines, consider rinsing them in running water and patting them dry with clean paper towels. Even though the peels will not be frozen with the flesh of the fruit, any dirt on the peels can get onto your hands as you work. Your hands will then touch the flesh of the fruit and spread the dirt there.
Note that this is the only way to store clementines in the freezer. You cannot freeze whole citrus fruits without significantly damaging its texture and taste.

, Place the clementine segments inside an airtight freezer-safe plastic container or resealable plastic bag. Do not fill the container more than three-quarters full.

, Combine 2-3/4 cups (685 ml) of sugar with 4 cups (1 L) of water in a large saucepan. Heat this mixture on your stove over medium-high, stirring frequently, until the sugar has dissolved and the solution is clear. Allow the syrup to reach a rolling boil before removing it from the heat.After making the syrup, let it sit out at room temperature until it cools. Do not continue on with the rest of the steps until the syrup has dropped to a temperature only a little warmer than room temperature. Ideally, the syrup should drop down completely to room temperature.

, Pour the cooled syrup over the clementine segments inside their freezer-safe containers. Add enough syrup to thoroughly coat each segment, leaving at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of empty head space at the top of each container.


You need to maintain a little empty headspace because the contents of the container can swell as they freeze. If the container is too full, the frozen fruit and syrup could burst out, damaging the container and creating a mess in your freezer as it does.
Seal the containers or bags securely, pressing out as much air as possible as you do.

, Place your sealed container of clementine wedges in the back of the freezer. You should be able to store it there safely for about a year.


To thaw, place the container of frozen clementines in your refrigerator and let it gradually drop down in temperature over the course of a few hours.
If stored at 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius), the clementines should be safe to eat indefinitely. They may lose a considerable amount of nutrients past the 12-month mark, though, and the texture and taste may also start to decline.

Gather the basics.,
Begin to build on the basic meal.,
Add an easy side dish.,
Build on the simple dishes you're already making.,
Experiment with different additions to your current meals.,
For a nice dessert, get out a can of sliced peaches.",How to Prepare Food if You Are Lazy," If you have a pulse, most likely you have a loaf of sliced white bread in the house. Ditto for a toaster. If not, these are absolute necessities for any culinary-inclined lazy person, as toast takes almost no time or effort to make and can be the base of a wide variety of meals.;
, Spice up your toast with a slice of cheese, as this adds protein and, more importantly, flavor to your budding meal. Toast bread with cheese on top in a toaster oven, or add cheese to bread once you've toasted it. Then top your cheese toast with a little salsa and sliced avocado, and put it all together for a delicious and well-rounded sandwich.

, Cut up lettuce and tomatoes and top with any salad dressing for a side salad.  If you have cornflakes lying around, crush some up in your hands and throw them on top of the salad for a little crunch. In almost no more time than it took to make yourself a simple sandwich, you've created a much more elaborate two-dish meal, making a better lunch for the lazy but hungry.

, Have you been cooking frozen hamburger patties for dinner every night? With just a little more effort, you can come up with a much better meal. Slice up an onion and throw it in a frying pan with a couple tablespoons of water and cooking oil. Cook uncovered on medium for about 15 minutes until they start to get a little caramelized.  Add your hamburger patties (pre-thawed in the microwave) and cover the pan.  Let the whole thing cook like that for another 15 minutes or so. Throw a handful of shredded cheese on them and allow it to melt before turning off the heat. Tear up some french bread to eat with it on the side. This makes for a much nicer meal than your average hamburger, but takes only a little more time and effort to prepare.


If you've been eating tacos, throw some fresh vegetables in with the meat while cooking, and top with avocados and tomatoes. If you eat a lot of instant macaroni and cheese, embellish with tomatoes, bell peppers, and canned tuna for a much more well-rounded meal. Get creative - you can enhance almost any quick and easy meal to make it a little tastier.

, If you eat a hamburger every day, no need to stop now - but dress it a little differently every time to add more spice and variety into your culinary lifestyle. You can top your burgers with mozzarella and tomato sauce and sprinkle them with oregano or basil for a pizza burger. You can top them with ranch dressing and crush tortilla chips on top for a tex-mex burger. You can skip the cheese and sprinkle soy sauce on top, add a smidge of ginger, and cook up some rice noodles to eat on the side for an Asian version. Be creative and try out as many styles as you can think of.

,  If you have sour cream in the house, put some in a bowl, drain the peaches, and add to the cream.  Mix together and if you want to sprinkle with shredded coconut flakes (they're very cheap). Canned fruit is one of the easiest things to prepare but can make for a delicious dish.

Trim the stems.,
Keep the leaves dry.,
Fill a jar with a little water.Fill one-quarter to one-half of a clean glass jar with cool water.,
Loosely cover the herbs with a plastic bag.,
Keep the jar in the refrigerator.,
Change the water periodically.",How to Store Cilantro1," Use a sharp pair of kitchen scissors to trim no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the bottom stem of each sprig of cilantro.


By trimming off the bottom of each stem, you are exposing the fresh, “live” portion of the herb still capable of taking in water. After a stem end is exposed to the air for an hour or so, it will die, making the plant's ability to take in water severely limited.
If you do not have kitchen scissors, you could also trim the stem using a sharp knife.;
, Do not rinse the cilantro at this point. The leaves should not get wet.


If there is dirt or debris needing to be rinsed off, you should wait until just before you are ready to use the cilantro. Rinse the cilantro after you store it, not beforehand.

,


The water level should only be high enough to cover the stems. Do not make the water so high that the leaves are submerged.






In essence, you are treating the cut cilantro like you would treat cut flowers. The cilantro will absorb the water through its stems as a vase of flowers would do. As a result, the leaves if the cilantro will stay fresh and vibrant for a longer period of time.







, Place a clean plastic baggie over the jar, covering the leaves and the mouth of the jar.


If desired, you could secure the bag in place by wrapping a rubber band over the bottom. This is not essential, though, and there is some question as to whether or not it even helps.






By placing a bag over the cilantro, you limit the amount of harsh air exposure it receives.







, Store the cilantro in your refrigerator until the leaves start to wither or discolor.


The cilantro will usually stay fresh and vibrant for two weeks, if not longer.

, Once the water starts to discolor, you should dump it and refill the jar with clean, fresh water.


You will likely need to change the water every few days.

Before buying, make sure the package is properly wrapped and sealed, and that the cheese inside looks appealing.,
Keep cheese in a covered container in your refrigerator on a clean, dry, lightly crumpled paper towel or two, leaving a little breathing room.,
When mold starts to form, it will consume the oil and not the cheese; simply wipe it off, or rinse in tepid water.,
Keep washed rind, blue, flavored and white rind cheeses in separate containers to prevent mingling.








,
If it's for just a few days, an oversized resealable bag with a crumpled towel will do.,
If stored as above and rubbed with oil, larger chunks of semi-hard and hard natural cheeses can keep for months.",How to Store Cheese Successfully at Home," Avoid any cheese that looks dry or discolored, as the seal may be broken or buy from a service counter from people who know their cheese. Check the freshness date on the package for fresh cheeses. When you get them home:









Fresh cheeses should be kept cold, in their original containers, and consumed quickly.
Unwrap all other cheeses immediately. Plastic wrap suffocates cheese.
Rub the surface of all but american, Grey, Bleu, and Washed Rind cheeses with olive, canola or other cooking oil. Rub only the cut faces of the White, Grey and Washed rinds. Bleu will protect itself.;
, Similar cheeses can not be stored together, as long as they don’t touch. You can use plastic webbing, or the mats they use to roll up sushi, to stack in layers and still allow airspace.








, Dry, rub with fresh oil and store as above in a clean container with clean towels.








,, Be sure to minimize contact so it can breathe.








, Wipe off any mold every couple of weeks as it forms. After a few treatments, mold will slow or cease to grow if your container has enough towels to soak up excess moisture. Change the towels and wash container often.

Spread the cilantro out on a baking sheet.,
Freeze for 30 minutes.,
Transfer the frozen cilantro to plastic freezer bags.,
Store in the freezer.",How to Store Cilantro2," Rinse fresh sprigs of cilantro under cool, running water. Drain the herbs and pat them dry with clean paper towels.


You can drain the cilantro by letting it sit inside a colander for a few minutes or by laying down several layers of clean paper towels and spreading the cilantro out on the paper towels until the excess water naturally drips away.
The cilantro should be fairly dry if you plan to use this method, so you should pat the sprigs dry using paper towels. Do not rub the sprigs dry since doing so can damage the leaves.

, You can freeze whole sprigs of cilantro, but if you want to make the cilantro easier to use after thawing it, you can use a sharp knife to trim the leaves from the stalks.


Alternatively, you could also snip the leaves off using clean kitchen scissors.






The advantageous part of removing the leaves is that you can measure out portions of frozen cilantro more easily when it comes time to thaw and use the herb.







, Lay the cilantro out in a single layer on the baking sheet, making sure that the sprigs or leaves do not touch or overlap much.


If the cilantro overlaps into multiple layers, these layers will stick together, making it harder to separate them when you need to thaw them out.

, Place the baking sheet until the leaves or sprigs are frozen solid.


By tray-freezing the cilantro first, you will freeze each leaf or sprig individually. If you were to freeze the sprigs or leaves in a bunch, the cilantro would stick together in a solid mass.

, Scoop the cilantro into plastic freezer bags. Keep 1/4 cup (60 ml) or otherwise equal amounts of the cilantro in each bag.


Mark each freezer bag with the name of the herb, the date you froze it, and how much the bag contains.

, Keep the cilantro in the freezer for several months this way.


When ready to use, thaw the cilantro on the counter until it drops down to room temperature.

Transfer cilantro cubes to a freezer bag, if desired.",How to Store Cilantro3," Wash fresh sprigs of cilantro by rinsing them under cool, running water. Drain the herbs to get rid of any excess water.


Drain the cilantro by letting it sit in a colander or on layers of clean paper towels for several minutes. You only need to drain off the excess water so that the cilantro is not dripping wet.






You can pat the herbs dry with clean paper towels, if desired, but when using this method, you will end up storing the herbs in water. As such, it is not essential that the cilantro is dried beforehand.







, Use a sharp kitchen knife to trim the leaves from the stems and chop the leaves into small pieces.


You could also accomplish this by cutting the leaves with sharp kitchen scissors, but since the leaves need to be removed and chopped, a knife will work best.
The cilantro should be chopped into pieces that are fine enough to use for cooking purposes.

, Continue measuring out the cilantro in even amounts and placing each one in its own slot.


By placing pre-measured amounts of cilantro in each ice cube tray slot, you will be able to thaw and use precisely what you need when the time comes.

, Gradually spoon cool water over the cilantro in each slot just until the cilantro is fully covered.


Do not pour running water over the cilantro since doing so could cause the water to overflow, displacing some of the measured-out cilantro as a result.






Covering the cilantro with water keeps it fresher for a slightly longer period of time.







, Pop the ice cube trays into the freezer for several hours until the water solidifies.


The cilantro can be stored in ice cube trays for several months and will usually last a month or so longer than cilantro frozen out of ice.






When ready to use, thaw the cilantro on the counter until the ice melts. Drain the leaves and pat them dry with clean paper towels. Alternatively, add frozen cubes of cilantro directly to stews or sauces and let the cubes melt directly into the other liquid.







, If you want to free up room in your freezer, you can remove the frozen cilantro cubes from the ice cube tray and transfer them into a freezer-safe plastic bag.


Label the bag with the name of the herb and the date you stored the herb.

Trim the ends and dry leaves.,
Tie bunches at the stem ends.,
Hang the bunches upside-down.Tie the free end of the twine to a hanger or hook and let the cilantro bunch hang freely upside-down.,
Store in a cool, dry, dark place.,
Finished.

",How to Store Cilantro4," Use sharp, clean kitchen scissors to trim away no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the bottom end of the each cilantro sprig. Also cut away any leaves that have already yellowed or dried.


You could also use a sharp kitchen knife instead of a pair of scissors.






This is not absolutely essential when drying herbs. Since the herb will dry out, anyway, you do not need to expose a fresh end first. By doing this, however, you preserve as much flavor as possible. The end and leaves that have already dried on their own will have far less flavor and will not be worth storing alongside properly dried portions of the sprig.







, Gather several sprigs of cilantro into a bunch and wrap a long piece of twine around the bottom of the stems. Tie the twine in place.


You should usually bundle about four to six springs at once.






Wrap the twine around all the stems several times and knot the twine firmly in place. The twine should be positioned roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom of the stems.







,


Keep the cilantro in a warm, draft-free area as it dries.






Keep the cilantro out of direct sunlight as you dry it. Sun will cause the leaves to discolor.






If necessary, place a paper bag over the cilantro to protect it from sunlight and drafts. Poke holes in the paper bag to improve airflow and prevent mold from growing.






The cilantro should dry completely in about two weeks. Check the bunches every day or two to make sure that the twine has not loosened too much.







, After the cilantro dries, you can store it for at least half a year.


For best results, keep the dried herbs in airtight containers or resealable plastic bags.






Label each container with the name of the herb and the date you started storing it.

Decide what kind of seaweed you want to prepare.,
Buy or collect and dry seaweed.,
Prepare seaweed before eating or cooking by soaking it.,
Cook seaweed.",How to Prepare and Cook Seaweed," There are many kinds of edible seaweed. A few of the more common are described below.


Alaria is light green and almost transparent.
Arame is thin, wiry, and almost black.
Dulse is dark red.
Hiziki is thin, wiry, and almost black.
Kelp, also known as kombu, is the largest seaweed.
Nori is used as the wrapper for many types of sushi and is probably the most recognizable type of seaweed.
Wakame is related to Alaria. It is also light green and almost transparent.;
,


Seaweed can be bought in many specialty supermarkets, catalogs and online. Almost all seaweed sold in stores is dried.
Most seaweed is collected in the spring or summer. Bring a knife or pair of scissors and a bag. Different types of seaweed prefer different conditions. The wave energy and substrate of an area determine which seaweeds will grow there. Get to know your local species and where they live. Do not take all of the seaweed from one area and leave the lower portion of the frond in place. Rinse fronds gently in the ocean before you take them home.
If you have collected your own seaweed, you will probably want to dry some for storage. Spread your seaweed on newspaper and leave it in the sun or a warm room for about a week or dry it for a few hours in a warm oven.

,


Most dried seaweed must be soaked before eating. Nori is a notable exception.
Soak dried seaweed in a large bowl of warm water until it is tender. Most seaweed will only take a few minutes to become tender and dulse becomes tender so quickly that you only need to run it under warm water.

,

Make your own soups.,
Prepare tacos.,
Cook foods high in potassium.",How to Prepare Low Sodium Lunches1," Canned soups and ramen noodles are high in sodium. Although you may be able to find low sodium options, your best bet is to make your own. You can make a large pot of soup ahead of time, and reheat smaller portions on a daily basis.



Low sodium chicken soup: boil seven cups of water and five cups of low sodium chicken broth in a large pot. Add one pound of cooked and shredded chicken breast, one diced onion, four celery stalks, and two tablespoons of parsley. Simmer for an hour.Sweet potato and turkey soup: in a pot, put four cups of low sodium broth, one pound of chopped turkey breast, one chopped onion, one chopped sweet potato, and one teaspoon savory. Bring it to a boil before reducing the heat. Let it simmer for twenty minutes.;
, Tacos are a great lunch as they are easy to prepare. Since tacos are usually spiced, you do not need to add salt to the recipe. You can have great taste without the sodium.


For a basic taco, cook ground beef or turkey with a can of salt-free tomato sauce, one diced onion, and two cloves of garlic. Add chili powder, red pepper flakes, oregano, cumin, and paprika to taste. Wrap the meat in corn tortillas, and add shredded lettuce and diced tomatoes.For steak and herb tacos, mix chili powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and oil. Pour the mixture over a sirloin steak. Cook the steak for at least nine minutes on each side. Slice the meat. Place the meat in a corn tortilla, and top with diced tomatoes, cilantro, or other toppings., Many low sodium foods may substitute salt with potassium. If you are cutting out sodium for heart related reasons, high potassium foods may be able to decrease your blood pressure.High potassium foods include potatoes, cantaloupe, bananas, beans, milk, and yogurt.
Spinach and strawberry are also high in potassium. Use both to make a tasty salad. Toss spinach leaves with strawberry slices and toasted, unsalted pecans. Add a citrus vinaigrette as a dressing.If you have kidney disease, you should not eat a diet high in potassium. Talk to your doctor about other alternatives.

Take the food out of the freezer and defrost it.,
Use a water bath to defrost the food.,
Use a saucepan of water on the stove to defrost the food.,
Transfer the amount of food you need into a microwave safe container.,
Heat the food for 15 seconds.,
Stir the food once it is properly reheated.,
Place the food in a saucepan.,
Turn the stovetop temperature to a very low setting.,
Check the temperature of the food before you serve it.,
Throw away any left over food.,
Use other equipment to reheat your baby’s food.,
Serve any reheated food to your baby within 48 hours.,
Always test the food before giving it to your baby.,
Do not refreeze any uneaten food or re-store it.",How to Reheat Frozen Baby Food," Place the desired amount of frozen food in a storage container. Make sure you put the lid on the container to avoid food contamination. Put the container in the refrigerator and let it sit overnight.


Thawed food can be stored in the refrigerator for a maximum of three days.You can also thaw food in the fridge during the day, but you should allow for about four hours of thawing time.Do not place food on the kitchen counter to thaw as bacteria may contaminate the food.;
, Another option is to submerge the sealed frozen bags of food or frozen jars of food in warm water, or a water bath.You want to submerge the food for at least 10 to 20 minutes, so replace the water as often as needed. Depending on the size of the frozen bags or jars, this process can be relatively quick, but larger quantities of food will mean more thawing time in the water bath.


Once the baby food is thawed, place the food in separate containers depending on your desired portioning. Put the cover on each container and store them in the refrigerator until you are ready to serve them., If the frozen food is still in its original glass jars, place the jars into the saucepan with some water.


Make sure the jars are sealed so water does not get into the food.
Stir the water frequently and allow the food to thaw—let the food cool completely before serving., The use of a microwave to reheat the food is a convenient and easy to use method. But always use microwave safe ceramics like Corelle or other glass bowls or jars to heat up the food. Do not use plastic containers for the microwave as the harmful chemicals in the plastic can leak into your baby food.

, Increase the amount of seconds if the food is not completely heated after 15 seconds. Do this gradually and in small amounts as you want to ensure the food’s temperature is not too hot.You can also use the defrost setting on your microwave, if it has one.

, Microwaves can cause food to heat unevenly and create hot spots. These hot spots of food could burn your baby’s mouth, so stir the food to make sure it is evenly cooled.Serve the food once it is completely cooled to avoid burning injuries. Set aside extra food in another container to allow it to cool.
You can also cool your baby’s food in a bowl of cold water once it comes out of the microwave. Place the food in a bowl of cold water and stir it consistently until it cools down.

, Choose a saucepan that is large enough to fit the sealed container of baby food you want to reheat.

, This will prevent the food from burning.

, Never serve food that is too warm as this can lead to burning injuries. Stir the food to cool it down.

, Do not store any left over food as it could become contaminated and lead to illness or poisoning.

, One example is the Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker. This product can be used as a defroster and steamer at the same time. It can also be used as a blender and a warmer.


This equipment quickly defrosts and reheats pre cooked baby food.

, Because of the risk of contamination, only thaw enough food for your baby to last 1 to 2 days.Before you serve the food, separate the amount of food that you will be feeding to your baby into portions. Place the food in separate containers.

, You can do this by dabbing a small amount of food inside your wrist or placing the back of your hand against the container of food to check if the food is at a comfortable temperature for your baby.Keep in mind that the food can be served at room temperature once it has been thawed and reheated. Re-heating is important to help kill bacteria, especially in food that contains meat and fish, but warming food up does not kill any bacteria.

, Make sure you throw away any food that is not consumed once your baby has finished eating. Your baby’s saliva may contaminate the food that remains in the container so do not refreeze or re-store it."

Make meatless sandwiches.,
Toss a salad.,
Make a side of fruit salad.,
Prepare a bag of raw vegetables.,
Add a yogurt cup.",How to Prepare Low Sodium Lunches2," Deli meats and breads can both be high in sodium, and you may be eating up to a fifth of your daily sodium intake when you eat a sandwich.You can make low sodium sandwiches, however, by avoiding processed meats and using a low sodium bread.


You can make vegetarian sandwiches, such as egg salad, strawberry and cream cheese, or veggie and hummus.
If you do use meats, make sure that they are marked as low sodium options. Aim for white meat options, like turkey or chicken.
Avoid salty condiments, like relish or ketchup.

, Salads give you many different options. As long as you don’t add salted croutons or nuts, they are easy to make as a low sodium meal. Pack a salad in a plastic container, and use a smaller cup for a dressing. Add the dressing only when you are ready to eat. Make sure that your dressing is low sodium as well.



Apple and pecan salad: put lettuce, apple slices, and pecans in a bowl. To make the dressing, mix together in a separate bowl three teaspoons of orange zest, one teaspoon of Dijon mustard, one tablespoon of white wine vinegar, three tablespoons of olive oil, and the juice of one orange. Add to the salad.Citrus salad: prepare the dressing by juicing three oranges and mixing the juice with one tablespoon Dijon mustard, one tablespoon tarragon, and one-fourth of a cup olive oil. Toss the salad in the dressing, and add slices of grapefruit, clementine, and mandarin oranges. Sprinkle toasted coconut on top, if desired., Fruit salad is naturally low in sodium. Chop up your favorite fruits, and toss them together in a bowl. Try to use fresh fruit if possible. You can also buy fruit cups or canned fruit, as neither are packaged with extra salt.


For a basic fruit salad, chop cantaloupe, melon, and watermelon. Mix these in a bowl. Add blueberries or grapes if desired.
If you want something a little different, you can try a berry mint salad. In a bowl, combine blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries. In a separate dish, mix equal amounts of mint, honey, and lemon juice. Pour the mint dressing over the berries., Instead of chips or pretzels, put some fresh, raw vegetables in a bag. These make a tasty and crunchy side dish. If desired, you may also want to pack a small cup of low-sodium hummus to dip the veggies in. Some good vegetables include:


Broccoli or cauliflower spears
Carrot sticks
Snow peas
Grape tomatoes, Yogurt is low in sodium. Yogurt cups are easy to throw into a lunchbox, and there are many different flavors that you can choose from. Make sure to bring a spoon so that you can eat it wherever you are.

Read the nutrition label.,
Pay attention to serving size.,
Identify low sodium labels.,
Aim for fresh, frozen, or dried foods.,
Find dairy products.,
Avoid processed foods.",How to Prepare Low Sodium Lunches3," Nutrition labels are posted on the side of packaged foods. Make reading these labels a habit. Check the amount of sodium per serving. You should aim to have no more than 2,300 mg of sodium a day. Your doctor may recommend an even lower daily limit.


Aim to have less than 5% of your daily value (DV) per serving of food.

, Some food may seem to have a small amount of sodium. If the serving size is small, however, you may unintentionally consume high amounts of sodium if you eat larger servings of the food. Always check the nutrition label to see what the serving size is.For example, a sauce may state that it only has 5 mg of sodium per serving. If you do not realize that the serving size is only one tablespoon, however, you may accidentally eat several tablespoons without realizing how much salt you're really consuming.

, Many foods may have low sodium versions, and these might be marked on the label as “sodium free” or “light in sodium.” Learn the difference between these labels so that you know just how much sodium you will be consuming.Reduced or less sodium: there is at least 35 percent less sodium than the original version of the product.

Light in sodium: the product contains at least 50 percent less sodium than the normal version.

Low sodium: the product contains 140 mg of sodium or less per serving.

Sodium free: there is less than 5 mg of sodium per serving in this product.

, Fruits and vegetables are key to a healthy diet, but it is important to buy the right kinds of foods. Canned vegetables are processed with high levels of sodium. Instead, buy your fruits and vegetables either frozen or fresh. If you want beans, buy the dried version instead of the canned version.While plain frozen vegetables are good, frozen meals or prepared foods often contain high levels of salt.

, Dairy products can make low sodium foods tastier, and there are many low sodium dairy options available. If the dairy has been processed, however, salt may have been added. Always double-check the sodium content on the nutrition label.


Look for low fat milk, yogurt, and soy milk options.Mozzarella, ricotta, Swiss, and cream cheese are all typically lower in sodium while other cheeses tend to be higher in sodium.
Regular milk and cream are low in sodium whereas buttermilk is high in sodium., The more processed the food is, the more likely salt is used as a preservative. Try to make your own food as much as possible to avoid high sodium intake. In particular, watch out for:


Cured meats like bacon, smoked brisket, or deli meats
Premade meals such as frozen dinners, canned soups, or foods with sauces.
Snacks like chips, pretzels, and breadsticks.
Pickled foods like relish.
Prepackaged spice mixes or sauces."

Store the ripe bananas with unripe fruit.,
Wrap the stems of the bananas in plastic wrap.,
Put the bananas in the produce drawer of your refrigerator after they are fully ripe.,
Peel the bananas before freezing them.,
Store bananas in the freezer for several months.,
Make banana bread with overripe bananas.",How to Store Bananas," Depending on when you want to use them and how you wish to store them, you may want them to be more or less ripe. If you're shopping just for yourself, then you may want greener bananas so they aren't all ripe right away. If you're shopping for a family or a few people who will eat them quickly, then ripe bananas are the way to go. Here are some things to keep in mind when choosing your bananas:









Green bananas are not ripe yet. Buy green bananas for maximum storage life without freezing. Choose firm fruit without dark spots or abrasions on the peel.
Ripe bananas have turned their adult color. Most bananas are yellow when ripe, but some varieties are brown or red. The more the banana's adult color appears on the peel, the riper it is.
Brown-spotted bananas are the sweetest. As the small brown spots grow on the peel, the fruit inside ripens even further. When the peel shows more brown or black than yellow, the fruit is over-ripe.
Avoid bananas that have a gray tint and look dull in color. This is a sign that the bananas were refrigerated, which interferes with proper ripening.;
, Never store bananas in plastic bags, which hold too much moisture and could cause the fruit to rot.









There is an alternative theory. The bananas may remain fresh longer inside the bag; take one out and leave the rest in the bag to test this. If the one that is removed ripens faster, then the bag may prove capable of retaining freshness. However, this may depend on the humidity and heat levels in the room where you're storing the bananas.

, Refrigerating or freezing bananas before they ripen prevents the fruit from being able to properly ripen even after brought back to room temperature.









Put green bananas into a brown paper bag to speed up the ripening process. Add an apple or a tomato to the bag to ripen the bananas in less than 1 day.
Another way to speed up the ripening process is to place the bananas near other ripe fruit in a bowl, such as other ripe bananas.

, Be patient. Though it's true that the warmer the room, the sooner they will ripen, you should avoid placing the bananas in direct sunlight.








, If you're a true banana lover, then a banana tree is a great investment. You can find free-standing banana trees that you can place on your countertop, as well as mountable banana hangers. Banana trees and hangers allow air to circulate and avoid ""resting bruises"" on the fruit.








, Eat or refrigerate the bananas as spots develop on the skin and before they are overripe.








, If you've sliced a banana, whether it's to put it in the fridge or to make a delicious fruit salad, you should cover the slices in a bit of lemon juice, pineapple juice, or vinegar, all of which will keep it fresher for longer.







, If your bananas are already pretty ripe, then you can keep them fresh and yellow for longer by pulling each banana away from the bunch. This will keep each banana fresher for longer.








, Take an unripe pear or avocado and place it near the bananas, and it will slow down the ripening process of the bananas, while ripening faster itself. It's a win-win situation!








, This will prevent ethylene gas, which is produced naturally during the ripening process, from reaching other parts of the fruit and making it ripen too fast. You can even place some tape over the plastic wrap for some extra security. Every time you remove a banana from the bunch, rewrap it carefully. Alternately, you can just separate the bananas from the bunch and then wrap the stem of each one individually. This takes a bit of love, but it's worth it!, Refrigeration slows the ripening process considerably, but does not stop it. The peel will continue to turn brown, but the fruit will stay fresh and firm for 1 to 2 weeks. According to Dole Bananas, storing ripe bananas in the refrigerator will preserve their delicious taste for longer, even though their peels may turn black., Put as many as will fit into a zipper storage bag or plastic container and store in the freezer. Note: Freezing bananas in their peel will make it impossible to peel them if frozen. And once they thaw, they turn into a goopy mess. Add frozen, peeled bananas to smoothies.

, When thawed, you can use the bananas to bake and cook, as well as in fruit sauces and smoothies. You can also drizzle them with just a bit of lemon juice to keep them from turning brown.Peel bananas and cut them into chunks or mash them before freezing.
Portion the banana into the amounts you need to make a recipe.
Put portioned bananas into zipper freezer bags or plastic containers and store them in the freezer.

, Banana bread is a delicious treat that is designed to be made with overripe bananas. If it's too late for you to store them and eat them enjoyably, then it may be time to make this delicious treat. After all, you don't really want to waste what was once a tasty bunch of bananas, do you? All you need is a few simple ingredients, which include bananas, nuts, flour, eggs, butter, and cinnamon.

",How to Store Butter," Butter is best fresh, and in a perfect world, you'd purchase and consume the butter weekly.However, this isn't realistic for many people, so the key is to stick to small amounts, and fast consumption, fitting this in with your usual shopping routine. If you have found butter for a bargain price and don't want to overlook the savings, consider freezing the bulk of any excess butter.

, Butter easily absorbs the odors of other foods, thus it's important to provide a guard against this possibility., Alternatively, if you don't wish to wrap the butter, place it straight into the sealed container in its original packaging; the seal will prevent the transfer of odors and exposure to air.


Left unopened, salted butter will keep for several weeks., Once you start to use it, aim to work through it quickly.

,, While butter can be frozen as a whole block, it is probably more useful to cut it into usable chunk sizes, which will make it easier to thaw quickly and provide just the amount you need each time.

, Ensure that the foil completely covers the butter and overlaps for added protection.

, Alternatively, place it inside a freezer-proof container which is airtight.,, Unsalted butter has a shelf life of three months in the refrigerator (unopened), while it can be frozen for up to six months.Once opened, it will keep for two to three weeks in the refrigerator., If you cannot consume it within this time, you will need to freeze the unsalted butter, to ensure that it stays fresh for longer.


Wrap the butter well in foil to avoid other flavors from mingling with it.
Before wrapping, consider cutting it into smaller chunks that you can remove for use as needed.
Place a resealable freezer bag over it to prevent odor penetration.
Place in the freezer. Keep it away from any frozen food that might impart a strong odor. As noted, unsalted butter will keep for up to six months in the freezer.

, Butter spoils quickly at room temperature, due to its high water content., The salt as a preservative will help the butter to stay fresher a little longer.

, Store it in a cool, dark and dry cupboard or pantry when not in use. When on the table, keep the lid of the butter dish on when the butter is not being used.


Air is the source of turning butter rancid. Hence, keeping the lid on helps to slow down this process.If you like the idea of room temperature storage, consider getting a European storage crock. These come with a water seal that keeps the air out, the moisture in and retains the freshness of the butter for longer (up to two weeks).Inquire about this at your local kitchen store, or check online for providers.

, The butter will go rancid very quickly. For room temperature butter when it is hot, remove only the needed amount from the refrigerator a half hour to an hour before use and place in the butter dish/keeper; leave to warm at room temperature, with the lid firmly on. Then transfer to the table. Discard what has not been consumed at that meal.

, Ghee has had the milk solids removed. This means that it is less likely to go rancid and has a longer shelf life.

, Provided the room temperature is normal and not too hot, and you intend on using the ghee quickly, it is usually fine to store it at room temperature.If ghee has been made properly and is stored properly, it is possible to store it at room temperature for several decades.However, this is not advisable, as foods are best consumed within a short period of time of their production. If any moisture or milk solids remain in the ghee, it will not store well for a long period of time; it must be pure butter fat for it to stay fresh at room temperature.The container used to hold the ghee must be airtight, opaque and waterproof.Pickling crocks or porcelain jars/earthenware jars can be used for short-term room temperature storage.Colored glass jars or commercially specific hermetically sealed containers can be used for longer-term room temperature ghee storage., For long-term freshness and absolute certainty, it is a good idea to keep ghee refrigerated, especially once opened, and especially if you've made it yourself.Ensure that it is in an airtight container; it will still absorb the odors of aromatic foods around it.

, Use the bubble wrap with the small textured bubbles. The bubble wrap will enable the perfect amount of moisture to stay close to the carrots, but the texture of the bubble wrap will prevent that moisture from gathering right on the surface of the carrots. The bubble wrap will add up to two extra weeks of freshness to your carrots. Plastic bags lead to rotting.

, It is best to use carrots within one to two weeks, as this will provide you with the best nutrients and taste value.

, A little snow covering will keep them from freezing and in the spring you will be able to pick some lovely crisp carrots.

Be aware of guidelines for safe cooking.,
Cook steaks using high heat.,
Cook ground beef carefully.",How to Prepare and Serve Different Cuts of Beef2,"


Roasts: Allow cooked roasts to stand 15 to 20 minutes before carving. Beef tenderloin or rib eye roasts are tender roasts. They should be sliced 1/2 to 3/4-inch thick. Less tender roasts such as tri-tip should be sliced no thicker than 1/4-inch thick.
Rib Roasts: The knife should run along the ""face"" of the roast toward the rib bone when carving rib roasts. Run the knife along the bone to release the beef.
Tougher Cuts of Beef: (Brisket, tri-tip roasts and flank steaks should be carved diagonally across the grain. Pot roasts are sliced into medium to thin slices.Use a sharp knife to slice beef.

, Cook beef thoroughly. All meat should be thoroughly cooked. In general, tougher cuts of meat such as the mock tender roast, chuck steak, shank crosscut meat, round steak and flank steak should be cooked using a slow cooking method.


Recommend cooking methods include braising, stews or soups. Cook the meat slow and gently for the best flavor and tenderness. Round steak and flank steak are two exceptions. Both cuts of meat can be cooked quickly if they are marinated and broiled. Serve medium rare but not well done.

, Steaks such as top sirloin or fillet mignon can take high heat and quick cooking. Pan fry, broil or barbecue the steaks for best flavor. Again, do not undercook the meat.

, Ground beef should be cooked to a temperature of 160 °F (71 °C). Ground beef may come from any area of the cow and is handled extensively exposing the meat to potential bacteria. Cook to 160 °F (71 °C) to be safe."

Anything above 30% fat per weight would be considered adulterated beef. Most ground beef is ground and packaged in local stores rather than in food processing plants under USDA inspection. Even so, the federal labeling laws on fat content apply. Most states and cities set standards for store-packaged ground beef which, by law, cannot be less than federal standards. If products in retail stores were found to contain more than 30% fat by weight, they would be considered ""adulterated"" under federal law.

Choose a space for your pantry.,
Consider the food items you eat regularly.,
Take note of the ""food pyramid."",
Include common universal cooking ingredients.,
Stock your shelves with food staples.,
Keep frequently used ingredients on hand, even if they don't go into the pantry.,
Start cooking.,
Organize your pantry according to types of foods so that you can find things.,
Consider your freezer an extension of your pantry.,
Clean out your pantry occasionally.",How to Stock a Kitchen Pantry," If you have no dedicated space for a pantry, remember that any indoor place that is cool and dry could work. It's best also to keep your pantry near your kitchen. Be creative. You can use a cabinet in your kitchen, garage (if it doesn't get too hot or cold), cellar, or even a nearby closet or bin. If no space is built in, be creative and create your own.;
, Make a list of foods you eat at least once a week. Include the main ingredients of meals you cook. For example, you have spaghetti two nights a week, and meat loaf on the weekends. For these, you always need the same items: pasta, ground beef, bread crumbs, tomato sauce, Parmesan cheese, a loaf of Italian bread, a couple of eggs, etc. Write these items on your list.

, Your staples should include a little from all the food groups, but the pantry is only for things that don't need refrigerating, such as canned goods, oils and vinegars, and soups, rice or beans. (How to stock a fridge is a different matter.)

, Most pantries should include flour, sugar, salt, your favorite spices, and cooking oil. (Don't go overboard with spices, but if you use spices a lot try to buy whole they last at least around 2 years under proper conditions).

, Your pantry should also have the basics of foods you eat a lot, such as rice, pasta, cereal, beans, lentils and potatoes. To keep them fresh and bug-free, use mason jars with screw-on lids, keeping one type of lentil, bean or rice in each, and write it on top along with the date. They look nice in there, too.

, You will also want to keep ingredients that you use frequently on hand. These items will go with many dishes, and include such things as: fresh onions, garlic, canned tomatoes, vegetable/chicken broth, high-quality olive oil (for dressing finished dishes, not for cooking), balsamic vinegar, chocolate syrup, tortillas.

, You can use the lists here for ideas to get started, but the very best way to stock your pantry is to buy extras of things that you use, when you use them. That way, your pantry will reflect your cooking style.

,


Grains: Rice, pasta, bread, beans, oatmeal, etc. Seal these tightly to prevent infestations. Also remember that while grains keep well for a long time, they do eventually go rancid.
Root vegetables: onions and potatoes, yams, and the like can go in your pantry. Just make sure to use them promptly.
Oils and sauces: olive oil, vegetable oil, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and so on. Many sauces require refrigeration, so read the labels first.
Baking supplies: baking soda, chocolate chips, salt, cooking spray.
Canned goods.
Prepared foods and snacks: crackers, cookies, dried fruit, chips, and anything else you like for munching.

, You can do a lot of cooking with frozen meats and veggies and a few pantry staples.

, If you find something that is old and spoiled, throw it out. If you find you no longer use as much of an item as you thought, and the food is still good, donate it to a canned food drive.

Place the avocado in a brown paper bag, if desired.,
Sit the avocado out at room temperature.,
Check the avocado each day.",How to Store Avocado1," You can skip the paper bag, but placing an unripe avocado in a paper bag will speed up the ripening process.


Without the paper bag, an avocado can take up to 7 days to ripen.With the paper bag, this time frame drops down to 3 to 5 days.






To speed the process up even more, place an apple or banana in the bag alongside the avocado. This will drop the time frame down to 2 to 3 days.






A brown paper bag traps ethylene gas produced by ripening fruit. Apples and bananas produce ethylene hormone in excess as they ripen, so placing an avocado in a bag with either of these fruits will cause all the fruit in that bag to ripen faster.





;
, Place the avocado on the counter or in a pantry, out of direct sunlight.


Ideally, the avocado should be kept in temperatures between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 and 24 degrees Celsius).
Do not refrigerate the unripe avocado. Refrigeration dramatically slows the ripening process, and as a result, your avocado may not ripen correctly or quickly.

, Give the avocado a light squeeze to determine how close it is to becoming ripe. A ripe avocado should yield slightly when gentle pressure is applied.


Avocados can be kept at room temperature for about a week if you start with an unripe one.






The avocado should only give a little when you press it. If you press the skin with your thumb and it leaves a bruise or deep, permanent indentation, the avocado may already be over-ripe.

Identify meals you and those in your home enjoy.,
Make a list.,
Break down each meal into its components that can be purchased at the store.,
Calculate your food amounts.,
Go to the store with this list and try to find the best price for everything on your list.,
Create storage space.,
Start building up as evenly as possible and try to fix all of your meals with things that have been in the house at least a week then a few weeks then a few months.

,
Prepare for longer food storage.,
Stock up on specially prepared foods for long-term storage.",How to Stockpile Food," Identify as many dinners, lunches, and breakfasts you can think of. You may want to keep a record of the meals you eat for a few months to get a better list of meals you enjoy.;
, You should include 30 dinners, 30 lunches, and 30 breakfasts that you really enjoy and can be prepared at home. Give each meal a name. With this list, you have a home menu for a month's worth of meals. If you can't come up with 30, try 15 of each as a starting place, but try to expand your list to 30 so you don't get sick of eating the same stuff over and over.

, For instance, Teriyaki meatballs over rice. This meal consists of 1 cup rice, 10 meatballs, teriyaki sauce, brown sugar, onions, and a side of mixed vegetables, and maybe with a beverage such as milk. Once you have done this for each meal, add up how much of each item you need to fix all of the meals on your list. If you eat a lot of meat, you might find that in your 3 meals, you require many pounds of ground beef, several pounds of beef, several dozen frozen chicken breasts, etc. You might also learn that you eat many loaves of bread, many gallons of juice, and milk.

, With your totals for the month calculated, times everything by 3 and you have the makings of a three month's shopping list.

, Since now you know what you will be eating you can buy in large quantities and store it at home until it is needed.

, You may need to create some space to keep the extra food, both frozen, and dry/canned goods. This may mean purchasing an extra freezer, or some closed storage shelves. Some additional storage ideas are in the tips below.

,, Next longer term storage beyond 3 months needs to be considered. This may include basics such as rice, wheat, legumes, beans, canned meats, more canned fruit and vegetables, sugar, oil, yeast, and the supplies to make food out of these things such as a grinder. You may need to obtain the knowledge to use these basic ingredients to make palatable meals.

, Other items to think about are powdered eggs, powdered milk, and freeze-dried meals that come in packages ready to add boiling water.

Cover both halves with lemon or lime juice.,
Place the two halves back together.,
Wrap the avocado in plastic wrap.,
Refrigerate the fruit.,
Monitor its progress.",How to Store Avocado2," Brush the exposed surface of the avocado with enough acidic juice to coat lightly.


Cutting open an avocado causes the cellular walls inside the fruit to break apart, and a process known as oxidation will be triggered as a result. Oxidation is the process responsible for turning certain fruits brown.






An acidic agent will slow oxidation down.






Aside from lemon juice and lime juice, other acidic agents include orange juice, vinegar, and tomato juice.







, Fit the two halves back together as best as possible, securing the seedless half over the seed still lodged in the other half.


The idea is to limit exposure as much as possible. If both halves of the avocado are still intact at this point, fitting them back together will effectively cover up all of the exposed flesh. You cannot repair the broken cell membranes, so oxidation will still occur, but this step will help slow it down by reducing the amount of oxygen the flesh is exposed to.

, Tightly wrap the avocado in plastic wrap to create an airtight seal.


Alternatively, you could also place the avocado in an airtight container, vacuum-sealed plastic bag, or resealable plastic bag. All you really need to do at this point is to find a way to restrict or halt airflow to the fruit.






By creating an airtight seal, you are limiting the amount of oxygen that the surface of the avocado flesh will be exposed to, thereby slowing down the oxidation process.

, Place the wrapped avocado in the refrigerator for a few days, or until ripe.


Keep the avocado in a fruit shelf or in the back of your refrigerator, where temperatures tend to be their coldest.
Do not keep the avocado out on the counter or in the pantry at room temperature. Once the fruit is cut, it must be refrigerated to preserve its quality and edibility.

, Since the avocado is in the refrigerator, it will take a little longer to ripen than a whole avocado kept out at room temperature.


Cut, unripe avocados are more difficult to preserve. Depending on how far along the avocado was in its ripening process, it could take anywhere from a couple of days to a week to ripen. Occasionally, the flesh may even begin to oxidize before it fully ripens.






When ripe, the avocado should give slightly once you apply a little pressure with your fingers. Mushy avocados are over-ripe, however.







"
"
Place the avocado in a plastic bag.Squeeze as much air out as possible and seal the bag.,
Refrigerate the fruit.,
Check the avocado periodically.",How to Store Avocado3,"


Strictly speaking, since the fruit has not been cut open and the cell membranes have not been cut, it is not essential to place the avocado in a plastic bag or storage container. Doing so may extend the life of the fruit by another day or so, but this is only debatable.

, Place the avocado in a fruit drawer or at the back of a shelf in your refrigerator.


Do not keep ripe avocados out on the counter at room temperature, even if the fruit is whole and intact. The cold temperatures of the refrigerator can slow down the ripening process. As a result, an avocado stored in the refrigerator will take much more time to over-ripen and turn bad when compared to one kept out on the counter.

, A ripe, whole avocado stored in this manner should last for about three to five days.


If the avocado begins to feel mushy, or if the fruit bruises or gets a permanent indentation when pressed, it has become over-ripe and may no longer be good to eat.







"
"
Brush a little lemon or lime juice over the flesh.,
Alternatively, brush olive oil over the surface.,
Wrap the avocado in plastic wrap.,
Refrigerate.,
Check on the avocado frequently.",How to Store Avocado4," Coat the exposed flesh of the avocado with just enough acidic juice to cover the surface.


When you cut open an avocado, you cause its cellular walls to break apart, and a process known as oxidation will be triggered as a result. Oxidation is the process responsible for turning avocados and other fruits brown after being cut open.






An acidic agent will slow oxidation down. Other than lemon juice and lime juice, additional acidic agents include orange juice, vinegar, and tomato juice.







, If you do not have lemon or lime juice, or do not want to use it for whatever reason, coat the exposed flesh of the avocado with enough olive oil to lightly yet evenly cover the surface.


While the oil does nothing to directly slow down the oxidation of the fruit, the use of olive oil can create an even better airtight seal. With the flesh of the avocado exposed to even less oxygen, the oxidation process will naturally take a little longer than it would without the oil.

, Tightly wrap the cut avocado in plastic wrap to create an airtight seal.


Instead of using plastic wrap, you could also place the avocado in an airtight container, vacuum-sealed plastic bag, or resealable plastic bag. The important thing is simply to find a way to restrict or halt airflow to the fruit.






If using olive oil instead of acidic fruit juice, however, plastic wrap is your best bet since the combination of oil and cling wrap will create the strongest airtight seal.






In creating an airtight seal, you limit the amount of oxygen that the surface of the avocado flesh will be exposed to, thereby slowing down the oxidation process.







, Keep the avocado in a fruit drawer or in the back of your refrigerator.


Do not keep ripe avocados out at room temperature, especially if they have already been cut. The cold temperatures of the refrigerator can slow down the ripening process, thereby preventing the fruit from over-ripening too fast.

, A cut, ripe avocado stored in this manner will usually last a day or two before over-ripening.


If the avocado begins to feel mushy, or if pressing it causes a deep, permanent indentation, the fruit has become over-ripe and may no longer be good to eat.







"
"
Leave the seed inside the avocado half.Instead of removing the pit from the unused avocado half, leave it inside to slow down the oxidation process.,
Tightly wrap the avocado in plastic wrap.,
Refrigerate the fruit.,
Check on it periodically.",How to Store Avocado5,"


Leaving the seed inside the avocado causes fewer of the cell membranes to break apart. Moreover, the pit protects more of the flesh from air and light, which reduces the amount of oxygen the fruit gets exposed to and, therefore, the amount of oxidation it can go through.

, Wrap the cut avocado in plastic wrap, creating an airtight seal.


If you don't have plastic wrap, there are still other options available. You could place the avocado in an airtight container, vacuum-sealed plastic bag, or resealable plastic bag instead of using plastic wrap. All you really need to do at this point is restrict or halt airflow to the fruit.






When you create an airtight seal, you further limit the amount of oxygen that the surface of the avocado flesh will be exposed to, thus slowing down the oxidation process.







, Place the cut avocado in a fruit drawer or toward the back of your refrigerator.


Do not keep ripe avocados out at room temperature, especially if they have already been cut. The cold temperatures of the refrigerator can slow down the ripening process. This, then, prevents the fruit from over-ripening too fast.

, When a cut, ripe avocado is stored in this manner, it should last for a day or two before it begins to over-ripen.


If the avocado feels mushy, or if pressing it causes the fruit to bruise or gives it a deep, permanent indentation, the avocado has become over-ripe and may no longer be good to eat.

Cut open the avocado.,
Remove the pit.,
Peel the avocado.,
Puree the fruit.,
Add 1/2 to 1 Tbsp (7 1/2 to 15 ml) lemon or lime juice.,
Transfer the avocado to an airtight container.,
Store the avocado puree in a freezer.",How to Store Avocado6," Use a sharp kitchen knife to cut the avocado in half lengthwise.


Make sure that the fruit is clean before you begin.






Place it on a clean, secure surface and use a sharp knife to make the cut.






Twist the two halves apart to separate them.







, Dig the pit out with a large metal dinner spoon.


Alternatively, instead of digging the pit out with a spoon, you could also remove it by gently striking the pit with a sharp, heavy kitchen knife until the knife wedges its way inside. Then, twist the knife slightly to loosen and lift the pit.

, Scoop out the avocado flesh with a spoon or peel the outer skin off the flesh using your fingers.


To peel the skin off, cut the avocado into quarters and wedges. Grab the peel with your fingertips and pull it straight down and off like a banana peel.






You could also lift the flesh out whole by gliding a large metal serving spoon in between the side of the flesh and the skin. Once the flesh is loosen from the peel, simply lift it out.







, Place the avocado flesh in a food processor or blender and pulse until smooth.


An avocado must be turned into puree in order to freeze well. Whole, cut, diced, and even mashed avocados can degrade in terms of appearance, texture, taste, and overall quality when frozen.

, Place the avocado flesh in a food processor or blender and pulse until smooth.


An acidic agent will slow oxidation down and preserve the overall quality of the avocado puree for a longer period of time.

, Leave 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) of empty headspace in the container so that the avocado puree has room to expand as it freezes.Use an airtight plastic container, resealable plastic freezer bag, or vacuum-sealed plastic bag. Make sure that the container is safe for freezer use before using it, though.






Label the package with the name of the contents, the date you froze it, and the amount inside the package.







, When stored in this manner, an avocado can remain good for three to six months.


Once the avocado turns brown or otherwise discolors, it has likely begun to go bad.

Find kale that is refrigerated or just picked.,
Opt for organic kale if possible.,
Check the leaves and stems for firmness.,
Look at the color of the leaves and stems.",How to Shop for Kale1," After kale has been picked, it starts to degrade. To ensure that you are getting the freshest kale possible, make sure that the kale you are purchasing has been refrigerated or that it has just been picked.Look for kale in the refrigerated section of your grocery store. Don’t buy kale that is not refrigerated.
Ask farmers when the kale was picked and if it has been refrigerated. If it has been more than a few hours unrefrigerated, then you might want to pass on that kale. However, if it has been kept refrigerated, then it should be fine.;
, Kale that is sold in grocery stores has been widely tested for pesticides as part of the Environmental Working Group’s annual “Dirty Dozen” test and it tested positive for insecticides that are human nervous system toxins.For this reason, it is best to buy organic kale. This will help to ensure that the kale you are eating is as safe as possible.


Check the packaging for the words “certified organic” to determine if the kale you are buying is organic. If your store’s produce section has an organic section, then look for loose leaf kale in this area.
If you are shopping at a farmers’ market, you can check around to see if any of the farmers are certified organic. However, keep in mind that most small farms are not certified organic, even though they may use organic practices. Ask the farmers what they use for pest control and whether they use organic practices.

, The leaves and stems on fresh kale should be firm and not limp or wilted. If the kale you are looking at is limp, floppy, or wilted, then do not buy it.Most grocery stores mist their fresh produce to prevent them from becoming limp or wilted, but it is still a good idea to check.

, The leaves and stems should be a dark green or light green color, depending on the variety of kale you are looking at. Steer clear of any kale that has brownish or yellowish looking leaves. This means that the kale is starting to go bad."

Find root vegetables.,
Collect chiles and hot peppers.,
Use queso fresco or other cheeses.,
Find other fresh produce as necessary.",How to Stock Your Pantry for Mexican Cooking," These simple flour or corn discs are the conventional containers for many of the delicious concoctions on the Mexican menu. Many cooks prefer corn tortillas for a truly Mexican flavor.;
, Red beans or pintos, as well as black beans and other varieties of legumes, have their place in Mexican food.

, Mexican food utilizes the common types of meat that are also enjoyed in the more northern parts of the continent, namely, chicken, beef and pork. Some good additions are the cured chorizo or other sausages and dried meats that can last longer in storage without being frozen.

, For many, Mexican cuisine is not complete without the side of guacamole, a side dish made from crushed avocado, lemon and other ingredients.

, Mexican food may use the yucca plant, as well as the more global potato, in some dishes.

, One of the trademarks of the Mexican menu and those of parts further south is the inclusion of various kinds of hot peppers. This cooking element is something that residents of other world regions may not be used to, but some of these hot and spicy elements are critical to Mexican cooking.


Evaluate using habaneros, ancho chiles, chipotle peppers, poblanos or other kinds of peppers including bell peppers. Habaneros and other super spicy varieties are a staple in Mexican cooking. Poblanos are the types usually used for chile relleno or stuffed peppers because they have a milder taste. Bell peppers are often served cooked, though they can also be prepared for use raw or slightly crunchy.

, The soft queso fresco cheese is a major element in Mexican cuisine. Some other cheeses may also be used. Think about what is authentically Mexican and prepare your pantry accordingly.

, Some of the fixings of Mexican food include fresh lettuce and tomatoes. Getting the best, freshest produce is part of what separates top class Mexican kitchens from others, so think about what kinds of purchases are best for your pantry.

Start with curly kale.,
Go for lacinato kale.,
Look for red Russian kale.,
Try redbor kale.,
Seek out purple or white kale.",How to Shop for Kale2," Curly kale is the most common variety of kale, so if you have never tried it before, then you might want to start here.Curly kale has a crunchy texture and slightly bitter taste, but you can season it and add it to lots of different recipes.


This type of kale is widely available in the fresh produce sections of grocery stores, so you should have no problem finding it.

, If you want to try something a little more exotic, then you might want to try lacinato kale.This type of kale is also known as dinosaur kale, Tuscan kale and black kale.It has wrinkly, dark blue-green leaves, that are more tender than curly kale, and the flavor is a little sweeter and earthier than curly kale as well.


Since the leaves and stems of lacinato kale are so tender, this is a good type of kale to enjoy raw, such as in a salad.

, Red Russian kale is even sweeter than lacinato kale. This kind of kale is a bit harder to find, so you might need to check out a farmers’ market or a health food store.Make sure that you remove the stems completely if you decide to try red Russian kale, they are very tough and woody, which may upset your stomach.

, Redbor kale is a dark purple color, so some people use it as a decorative plant. However, it is edible.This variety of kale is also a bit harder to find, so check out a farmers’ market or health food store.


You can also purchase seeds for it and grow your own. Try growing some redbor kale in your garden and pick a few leaves to use in your cooking now and then.

, Purple and white kale are even harder to find, but they are really pretty varieties. These types of kale have a cabbage-like flavor, so they are not the most flavorful.Try checking out your local farmers’ market or health food store to see if they have any red or purple kale.

Cook your kale.,
Store any unused kale.",How to Shop for Kale3," Like any fresh produce you use, it is important to wash your kale to remove any dirt from the leaves and stems. You can wash the kale by holding it under running water or by immersing the kale into a bowl of clean, cold water.


It is also a good idea to check the leaves for bugs, especially if you purchased the kale from a farm stand or market. You can still eat the kale after you remove a bug from it, just make sure that you rinse it well.

, You will also want to trim the kale to remove the tough ends of the stems. Cut off the ends of the kale stems and then chop your kale as desired.


Depending on the variety of kale you are using, you might want to cut off the stems altogether. Some varieties of kale have very tough stems that might be difficult to chew, even after you cook them.

, Kale makes a great addition to fruit smoothies because it is loaded with antioxidants and it won’t overpower the other ingredients in your smoothie. You can add a handful of kale to your smoothies for an added boost of nutrition.Try making a green smoothie with a cup of orange juice, a ripe banana, a handful of ice cubes, and a handful of fresh, clean kale. Toss everything into your blender and blend for about 30 to 60 seconds.

, Kale has a crunchy, chewy texture when it is raw., If you prefer your greens cooked, then you can also cook your kale. Kale is quite versatile, so you can steam or boil it, add it to a stir fry, toss some into your soup, or use it to replace other types of greens in your recipes.


For example, you could try making spinach lasagna with steamed kale instead of spinach, or add some kale to an omelet instead of using chopped broccoli.
You can also try making kale chips, which is a healthier alternative to potato chips., For any fresh kale that you do not eat, make sure that you store it in an airtight container, such as in a Ziploc bag or a plastic container with a tight fitting lid. Place the bag or container in your refrigerator and use the rest of the kale within the next few days.

Look for authentic, knowledgeable instruction.,
Always select the best ingredients.,
Make sure you have the right equipment.,
Learn the art of stir frying.,
Find the perfect balance of flavors.",How to Master Thai Cooking Techniques," If you can, go to Thailand - there's no better way to taste and learn authentic Thai cooking. Bangkok is the hub for Thai cooking schools, and you can find anything from long elaborate cooking courses to short, concise daily classes that will help you get started with the basics. If you are unable to take a class or travel to Thailand, you can also purchase some good videos and books that will help you to learn the basics.;
, Nothing beats the flavor and quality of fresh ingredients, and they are absolutely necessary for any good Thai dish. Especially when it comes to the flavoring, the dried and packed version is nothing compared to the sheer aroma of the fresh version, so whenever possible, use only high-quality, fresh ingredients. If you are not able to find fresh herbs such as galangal, pandan, or kaffir lime you can opt for the frozen version of these; the flavor is nearly as good.

, When it comes to Thai cooking, there are not a lot of utensils and tools required. However, whatever is required is absolutely vital. The wok is the most important piece of utensil in Thai cuisine. Get a good one and learn to use it well. Wooden spoons or shovels are used in the Wok to stir fry the ingredients. Thai ingredients also require a lot of pounding to make flavors readily available for incorporation, so get a good stone mortar and pestle. This will help you crush cardamom pods, cumin pods and coriander, and other spices, and it is also an excellent tool to soften and beautifully bring out the fragrance of lemon grass. Finally, with the predominance of rice in Thai dishes, the rice cooker is an invaluable appliance that makes preparing rice both quick and easy; however, a simple stainless steel lidded pot will work just as well.

, Learn and adopt certain techniques. For example, always thoroughly chop and otherwise prepare the ingredients before placing any into the wok. Next, spread a suitable type of frying oil thoroughly throughout the wok and substantially heat it up before adding in the ingredients. Stir fry in high heat for just a few minutes in order to retain the freshness and flavor of the foods.

, Each recipe has its own unique balance of salty, sour, spicy and sweet tastes. The balance also varies with the preference of each individual, making taste-testing a pivotal component of Thai cooking. Learn to use a few helpful tips in balancing the flavors in your cooking. If a dish is too spicy, add yoghurt, coconut milk, or even a little bit of sugar. If a dish is too salty, a little bit of lime juice, lemon juice, or tamarind juice does the trick. If salt is required, it is better to opt for fish sauce or soy sauce rather than directly adding salt. This way the dish enjoys more flavors in addition to the saltiness that it needs. Sweeten a dish by adding plain white sugar, and spice up a dish by adding fresh or dried chilies, chili powder, cayenne pepper, or Thai chili sauce.

Organize your staples.",How to Stock Your Kitchen with Staples,"


Most kitchen staples are such because they have an extended shelf life and can be used in a variety of dishes. When deciding which kitchen items to stock up on, it is important to keep in mind how long you will be able to keep them in your pantry or refrigerator. You should buy a minimal amount if it is an item that has a short shelf life or if you will only use a small amount at a time. You should buy several boxes or cans of a staple item if it has a long shelf life and will be used in large amounts at a time. When your kitchen staples are on sale is a great time to stock your pantry.;
,


Herbs and spices are used in almost everything you make in your kitchen. The ingredients you choose to stock in your kitchen are specific to you and your type of cooking. If you do a lot of baking, you will probably choose staples such as cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg. If you cook more savory dishes, you will need kitchen staples such as black pepper, basil and dill. Choose staple herbs and spices that are most conducive to your style of cooking.

,


Dry ingredients such as beans, pasta, flour, sugar and rice are great kitchen staple items to always have on hand. These items can be added to a variety of dishes to change the flavor, consistency or can turn a thin dish into something hearty. Dry goods also have a lengthy shelf life so, once you stock up on them, you won't have to worry about purchasing them for quite awhile.

,


You can always keep meats, vegetables and fruits on hand by keeping a supply of them in your freezer. Stock up on these items when your favorite brand is on sale and you should be set for a long time. Be sure to store them well, though, to avoid freezer burn. There are many staple items that can last a long time in your refrigerator. Obviously, your typical mayonnaise, mustard, ketchup, jelly, salad dressing and butter have a fairly long shelf life. You can add more staples, though, to your list by placing other items such as coffee grinds, nuts, and oils in your refrigerator to lengthen the amount of time you can use them.

,


In order to make stocking up on staple items for your kitchen worth it, you have to use them. To help you remember what you have, it is important to have your kitchen organized and accessible. This will not only help you cook faster and more efficiently, but it will prevent you from buying more of an item you don't need.

Purchase inventory.",How to Start a Food Co‐op," If you’re serious about starting a food co-op, you need to become an expert on the topic. A food co-op is a member-owned business that buys food for its members. It’s owned and operated by the very people who use it. It seeks to find and sell food for the lowest possible prices, while rejecting misleading marketing or shady sales practices. Membership is open to anyone and everyone., Are you creating it to save money? Perhaps you want to be more involved in the community, or maybe you want to do your part to reduce harmful greenhouse gases by purchasing locally. Do you want to start a food co-op so that the people of your community have access to fresh, healthy produce? Whatever your reason, it’s important to identify your purpose. This will be your driving force throughout a process that experts say takes a minimum of two years to do properly., There is a lot that goes into creating a food co-op, so you’ll need a group of people to help get everything in order.This core group of people needs to be as dedicated and passionate as you are to create this food co-op. It’s a great idea to have people from different types of industries, if possible. For example, lawyers can help with the legal documents while business or finance-minded people can help with the financial aspects.

, When it comes to creating a food co-op, what works in one community may not necessarily work in yours. You’ll need to figure out how much it costs to rent the space you’ll need, the other grocery stores in the area that you’ll be competing with, the population you’ll be marketing and selling to, the health codes of the area, and so on.By gathering these facts and figures early, you will be able to create a plan moving forward. Additionally, you will garner confidence from the community if you’ve shown that you’ve done your research.

, Getting the information about your co-op out to the public is vitally important. You won’t be able to build a successful food co-op unless everyone in the community is aware of it, and you’re able to market effectively and recruit members. Utilize any and all outlets you can, such as newspaper ads, radio, flyers, signage, and word of mouth. You want the community to be talking about it., Unlike grocery stores, not everyone has used a food co-op. Many, or even most, people are unaware about the special benefits of co-ops, and may not fully realize what the co-op can do for the community. Hold a meeting so that people can learn more, ask questions, and understand why they should support your co-op. Advertise the meeting everywhere! Then, come prepared with more information than you think you’ll need. Be ready to explain what exactly a co-op is, the advantages of co-ops, common misunderstandings about them, and their financial and environmental benefits.Have informational pamphlets or flyers at the door for everyone to grab when they enter. People can follow along with these, and refer to them after the meeting is over.
Welcome questions from your audience. Do your research before the meeting to ensure you can answer all of their questions, especially the questions that are specific to your town. If you aren’t sure about a question, tell them to leave their email address so you can find an answer and let them know.

, This includes their email addresses, mailing addresses, and phone numbers. This is a very important aspect of your initial meeting. By getting a preliminary list of people who are in support of the co-op, you can start sending out newsletters, emails, and invitations. You can create an ongoing dialogue with these community members, updating them with the progress of the co-op and potentially getting your founding members.You can also begin reaching out to these interested community members for fundraising efforts. These people, who understand the long-term community benefits of a food co-op, may be willing to donate in order to get the co-op up and running.

, Many people will turn to the Internet to learn more about their community food co-op, so it’s important to put the information online for them.You can buy a custom URL for relatively cheap. Put your mission statement, membership information, and even general food co-op facts on your website. Allow people to sign up for email updates on your website.

, When you’re deciding how a member must contribute to the co-op financially, remember that the cost of setting up a food co-op is high. If you allow your members to use payment plans to pay off their investment requirement, you won’t raise a large sum of money in the beginning. This can make the start-up costs difficult or impossible to meet.


For example, if you make your membership cost $150 and gather 100 members who pay outright, you will have earned $15,000 towards start-up costs. If you allow them to pay in increments of $50, you will only start out with $5,000.
It can be helpful to give incentives to charter members who become members first and agree to pay their full membership fees outright.

, Do a little research about food co-op grant options in your area. These grants can help assist you with early start-up fees by giving you a sum of money right off the bat. These grants will have criteria for your co-op, from having a clear vision for your food co-op to being willing to match the grant amount through member investments.A Google search can help you find grants that will apply to your food co-op. There is help out there if you look around.

, The big initial costs that most people consider are the costs of renting a space and buying inventory, but there is a lot more that you will need. For example, how many employees will your co-op have? How much will it cost for your cash registers, freezers, refrigerators, and air conditioning? Will you have ovens or coffee machines? There is much more to a co-op than what initially meets the eye, and it’s important to visualize your co-op in its entirety when planning your budget.Start with a modest staff, and you can hire more as your co-op takes off. Their pay will initially come from your start-up fees, and can increase as revenue increases. The key is to hire people who are passionate and engaged in the co-op’s mission, and who understand how it works.
You can also call for volunteers to work the food co-op, which will obviously save money., Do your research! Make sure that you pick a location for your co-op that puts it in a convenient location for the population you are marketing to. Consider all of your options, such as building vs. remodeling and leasing vs. owning. Understand how many members you’ll need to take on to cover the costs of setting up your official site.Picking the right location and site can make or break a food co-op. Consult professional analysts to help you making smart business decisions.

, For this step, it’s wise to hire someone with experience drafting legal documents. This document will officially spell out how someone becomes a member, and what financial investment it requires from them. The membership system is the foundation of the co-op because without members, you have nothing. After you’ve laid out the requirements, responsibilities, and benefits of membership, compile it into an easily-understood brochure or pamphlet to distribute.When you’re deciding how a member must contribute to the co-op financially, remember that the cost of setting up a food co-op is high. If you allow your members to use payment plans to pay off their investment requirement, you won’t raise a large sum of money in the beginning. This can make the start-up costs difficult or impossible to meet.Officially recruit your members. Send out membership applications to interested parties, and collect investments from your members. These early investments are vital to covering your start-up costs.

, At this stage, it is so important to form relationships with the local farmers and food producers of the area. Because you will be buying food in bulk for members and for inventory, you will want to work with them to get the best quality for the best prices.Additionally, you need to be constantly talking with members to ensure you are purchasing the products they want and need.


The inventory you buy and sell will most likely evolve as your food co-op gets up and running. As you learn what sorts of things sell and do not sell in your area, you can tailor your inventory. The most important thing, however, is that you are listening to the members to ensure that you are meeting their needs, and that you are making sure to bring them the best quality product for the lowest possible price.

Bring 1 cup of water (250 ml) to a boil.,
Stir 15 grams (1/2 ounce) of malt extract into the water until it is completely dissolved.,
Add a packet of gelatin to the wort.,
Pour some of the gelatin-wort mixture into each of the jars or dishes you’re using to make your cultures.,
Place the jars or dishes in the bottom of the large stock pot.,
Add 2 to 3 inches (5 - 7.5 cm) of water to the dish.,
Bring the water in the stock pot to a boil.,
Lay out your working area.,
Prepare the yeast as directed on the package.,
Start culturing your slants.,
Insert the needle into the gelatin mixture and release the yeast.,
Cap the jar or dish tightly.,
Loosen each jar slightly to release the pressure built up in each jar, then tighten again.,
Label each jar with the date it was cultured.",How to Make Yeast1," Once you have achieved this, remove water from the heat.;
, Bring it to a boil for another 10-15 minutes. This will ensure sterility.


This second boil is sanitizing the medium mixture, which is called “wort.”

, Stir it until it is dissolved -- completely dissolved.

, Fill each container about 1/4 inch full. It's easiest to do this with a sterilized funnel if you're using a test tube or vials.


Keep one empty jar or dish aside for use later in the culturing process.

, Make sure it has a lid! This is where having vessels with a flat bottom comes in handy. If you're using tubes with a rounded base, you'll need to rack them to stand them up.

, Or enough so that the water comes halfway up the sides of your culturing vessels. Make sure the water does not get inside the jars.


Add the jar lids carefully. Don't put them on, just in -- this will sterilize them. If you put them on, everything may explode.

, Keep it on high for 15 minutes to sterilize the culturing vessels. Then remove vessels from the hot water using your kitchen tongs and cool completely. This may take a while, so be patient.


You need to wait for things to cool to at least 40 deg. C before attaching the sterile caps, otherwise the cooling growth-medium will cause the vials to either suck the caps into the vials, or actually implode. Once cool enough, put the caps on the vials firmly. Pros generally cool for 24 hours at a slant.
These are often referred to as “slants” by home brewers because many use test tubes and invert them at an angle so the wort-gelatin mixture inside solidifies on a slant.

, You're now going to need a number of things. It'll be easiest if you have them all at your side when you begin this process. You'll need:


Yeast pack
Slant vials
An unwrapped paper clip or long needle
Cotton ball or folded up paper-towel
Your vial of ethyl alcohol
Your starter vessel laid out on clean paper toweling,
An empty, unused slant vial that has been sterilized, along with its cap.

, Each package will list different tips and instructions, so follow them carefully. You'll need to shake the yeast so it swells and forms a paste.

, Open the yeast packet about halfway. Wipe the needle or paper clip with the alcohol swab (this sterilizes the needle and removes contaminants that could prevent the yeast from culturing properly).


Draw a small amount of the yeast paste into the needle or swirl the paper clip around in the yeast packet to coat it.

, Work as quickly as possible during this step to prevent contamination. Avoid breathing if at all possible.


Some brewers recommend placing an alcohol-soaked paper towel over the opening of the jar or dish and inserting the needle or paper clip through it into the dish to help prevent contamination when inserting the yeast.

, Place the jars in a clean, cool, dark place for 72 hours. Within a couple of days you will see a cloudy film on the slant surface, and a few days later it will develop into a milky white layer about 1 mm thick.


Wipe the outside of the jars and lids with alcohol swabs. As always, everything needs to be completely sterile.

,


You'll notice a slight hissing sound as you break the seal on the jar. That's excess carbon dioxide from the yeast grows as it escapes to reduce the pressure in the jar.

, Store in a clean refrigerator to continue culture growth. They will keep in perfect condition for at least 3 months.

, Add 1 teaspoon of sugar and and a pinch of salt.

, Add enough potato water to make one quart of mixture.

, Allow to ferment.


Note: If the starter is not rising, you can add a package of store bought yeast to speed up the process––but––it will be just as good if allowed to ferment without the added yeast.

Scrape the meat of the coconut from the shell.,
Cut the coconut meat into small pieces or shred the coconut flesh with the scraper.

,
Place the pieces into a food processor.

,
Turn on the food processor to a medium speed and blend until well shredded.,
Filter the coconut milk.,
Leave the jar unattended for at least 24 hours.,
Scoop out the curd with a spoon and discard it.",How to Make Virgin Coconut Oil1," Use a mature, brown coconut, rather than a young green one.;
, Use a coconut scraper, sharp pairing knife or a sturdy metal spoon. *Removing the meat is tricky. A butter knife is much better than a sharp pairing knife. You can slide it in between the meat and the shell and 'pop' pieces off, rather than slip, and cut your hand. 

,,, Add a little water to help it blend if necessary.

, Put a coffee filter or cheesecloth over a wide-mouth jar. Pour or spoon a small amount of the coconut mixture onto the cloth. Wrap the cloth around the coconut mixture and squeeze the milk into the jar.


Squeeze hard, to make sure you get every last drop.
Repeat this process until all of the coconut mixture has been used.

, As it sets, the coconut milk and oil will separate and a layer of curd will appear at the top of the jar.


Refrigerate the jar so the curd hardens more quickly if you'd like.
If you'd prefer not to refrigerate it, leave the jar in a cool room.

, The pure virgin coconut oil is left in the jar.

"
"
Start with dried or dehydrated coconut.,
Put the coconut in your juicer.,
Process the coconut again.,
Place the coconut oil in a jar and store in a warm place.,
Spoon the oil into a new container.",How to Make Virgin Coconut Oil2," You can buy dried unsweetened coconut flakes from the grocery store. Be sure the only ingredient the bag contains is coconut. If you want to start with fresh coconut meat, cut the meat into pieces and use a dehydrator to dry it out over the course of 24 hours.You can use the oven at its lowest temperature to dry coconut meat. Cut it into small chunks, place it on a baking sheet, and cook it at a low temperature for 8 hours, or until its completely dry.
If you're using store-bought coconut, go for the coconut flakes, rather than shredded coconut, which tends to clog the juicer.

, Juice the dried coconut in small batches, since placing a lot of coconut in the juicer will cause it to clog. The juicer will remove the oil and cream from the fiber. Continue processing the coconut until all of the flakes have been run through the juicer.

, The juicer won't be able to extract all of the oil the first time around, so run the coconut flakes through it once more to make sure you get every last drop.

, Wait 24 hours for the coconut cream to settle at the bottom of the jar. The pure coconut oil will rise to the top.

, Once the oil has separated from the cream and solidified, use a spoon to remove it from the first container and place it in a new container. It is now ready to use.

Heat 4 cups of water.,
Grate the meat of 2 coconuts.,
Blend the coconut and water.,
Strain the coconut liquid.,
Boil the coconut liquid.",How to Make Virgin Coconut Oil3," Place the water in a saucepan and put it on a burner. Turn the burner to medium high and heat the water until it starts steaming.

, Use a fully developed brown coconut instead of a young green one. Open the coconut, scoop out the meat and grate it into a bowl.

, Put the grated coconut in a blender. Pour the hot water over the coconut and close the lid of the blender. Hold the lid of the blender in place and puree the coconut and water into a smooth mixture.


Don't fill the blender more than halfway full with hot water. If your blender is on the smaller side, blend the coconut and water in two batches. Filling the blender too high may cause the lid to fly off.
Hold the lid in place while you're blending the mixture; otherwise it could come off while you're blending.

, Place cheesecloth or a fine-mesh strainer over a bowl. Pour the pureed coconut over the cloth or strainer so that the coconut milk drips into the bowl. Use a spatula to push the pulp and squeeze out as much liquid as possible.


If it's easier for you, you could pick up the cheesecloth and squeeze it over the bowl with your hands.
To extract even more liquid, pour more hot water over the pulp and squeeze it again.

, Place it in a saucepan on a burner and turn the heat to medium high. Bring it to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, until the water has evaporated and the cream has separated from the oil and turned brown.


The process of boiling the liquid until it reaches the right state could take over an hour. Be patient, and stir constantly.If you'd rather not boil the mixture, you can allow it to separate on its own. Place the liquid in a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Leave it at room temperature for 24 hours, then place it in the refrigerator so the oil solidifies and floats to the top. Strain the oil from the liquid."

Serve immediately.",How to Make Rava Dosa," Whisk together the semolina and buttermilk in small mixing bowl until evenly combined. Cover the bowl and allow the mixture to rest in a warm place for 15 to 30 minutes.Unlike other types of dosas, rava dosa does not need to ferment for a long period of time.
While this mixture rests, you can continue preparing the rest of the ingredients.;
, Use a sharp kitchen knife to cut both ingredients into fine pieces.


Remove the seeds and membranes from the green chilli if you would prefer a slightly milder flavor, or leave a few intact if you'd like something spicier.
Note that the diced chilli will be mixed into the batter, but the diced onion will be spread into the batter separately. For this reason, keep the two ingredients separated after dicing them instead of mixing them together.

, Using a whisk or mixing spoon, mix together the rice flour, all-purpose flour, diced chilli, cumin seeds, salt, and ground black pepper in a separate large mixing bowl.


Toss the ingredients together until they appear evenly distributed throughout the mixture.

, Pour the semolina-buttermilk mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir until combined.

, Add approximately 1-3/4 cups (440 ml) of water to the flour mixture, beating it well with the whisk. Continue until a thin, smooth batter forms.


Add the water a little at a time, beating well after each addition. Working slowly can make it easier to incorporate the water more thoroughly.
There should be no lumps left in the batter when it's ready, and the final consistency should be about as thin as buttermilk. Finished rava dosas are supposed to have a lacy appearance, and that appearance can only develop if the batter is thin.
If the batter becomes too thin, however, you can sprinkle a small amount of rice flour into it to help thicken it to the proper consistency.You may also wish to check the taste of the batter after it comes together. Add more salt, if necessary, mixing well to distribute it throughout.

, Place a 10-inch (25-cm) non-stick skillet with shallow sides on the stove and set the burner to medium heat.


For an even more accurate experience, use a tava-style griddle to cook the rava dosa. Any nonstick skillet should work well enough, though.
Allow the pan to become very hot. Test the skillet by sprinkling it with a small amount of water. Once the water immediately sizzles and steams, the pan is hot enough.
Note that the pan should remain on medium heat throughout the entire cooking process. If you set it to a higher heat, you'll likely burn the dosas.

, Dip a small piece of clean paper towel in cooking oil. Use it to wipe down the entire bottom of the hot pan, working carefully to avoid possible burns.


Alternatively, you could drizzle roughly 1 tsp (5 ml) of oil into the pan and wipe it across the bottom with a large slice of onion., Evenly spread 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of diced onion over the hot surface.


Don't add too many onions since doing so may make it more difficult to remove the dosa when it's done. Too many onions can also cause the dosas to tear when you attempt to flip or remove them.
You'll need to work quickly after you add the onion to prevent the onion from burning before the batter cooks.
Note that some people prefer to sprinkle the onion on top of the dosa batter instead of spreading it beneath. Both option are acceptable, and waiting until later may help prevent the onions from browning too quickly if you aren't confident about how fast you can work.

, Quickly mix the batter with your whisk immediately before pouring it onto the hot pan.


You'll need to quickly mix the batter each time you plan to pour more of it onto the pan. Otherwise, some of the semolina may settle at the bottom of the bowl, and the final texture and taste of the dosas could be negatively affected.

, Use a ladle to pour roughly 1/2 cup (125 ml) of batter into the hot pan. Pour the batter around the edges of the pan first, then wind your way inward toward the center.


Only pour the batter in a single layer, and hold the ladle from a high of roughly 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) as you pour. Do not attempt to spread the batter.If there are large gaps within the batter, quickly fill in those gaps with more batter. Leave the small gaps alone, however. The final dosa should be lacy and filled with small pockets of air.

, Quickly sprinkle the surface with some of the chopped cilantro. Pour another 1 tsp (5 ml) of cooking oil or ghee over the surface, as well.


If you did not add the diced onion to the pan before pouring the batter in, you'll need to sprinkle it over the surface of the dosa batter during this step.

, Cook the dosa over medium heat for at least 2 minutes, or until the bottom turns golden-brown.


You should be able to see hints of golden-brown coloring peeking through the holes and edges of the dosa. The edges of the dosa should also begin to lift away from the pan.

, Use a spatula to carefully flip the dosa over to the uncooked side. Drizzle this side with another 1 tsp (5 ml) of oil or ghee, as well.


Since the dosa is so thin, it could rip and tear if you turn it too forcefully. Make sure that the bottom has finished cooking and flip it over as carefully as possible.
If you're nervous about flipping the dosa, you could allow it to finish cooking without flipping it. The top will not brown as much if you do, however., Continue cooking the dosa for another 1 minute, or until the new bottom side turns a light golden color.


This second side will be a little lighter than the first, but both sides should be golden and crispy.

, Using your spatula, carefully fold the dosa into a half-circle. Slide it out of the pan and onto a serving plate.

, Cook the rest of the batter by following the same procedure. This recipe should be enough to prepare an approximate total of six dosas.


You may need to lightly grease the pan with additional cooking oil in between dosas.
Remember to quickly mix the batter before pouring any into the hot pan.
If the batter becomes too thick as it sits, stir in another 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of water.

, Enjoy the rava dosas while they're still hot.


You can eat rava dosas on their own, but they're more commonly served with coconut chutney, sambar, or idli podi.

",How to Make Vegetable Broth,"


Nearly any vegetable can be added to this vegetable broth recipe. Try adding 2 parsnips or 1 sweet potato. Broccoli, leeks and mushrooms make great additions. Also peppers, turnips and zucchini will add distinctive flavor to your broth.;
,,


Many fresh or dried herbs make great additions as well. Try rosemary, sage or even dill.

,,, (15 ml) sea salt.

,,,,


If you prefer a richer flavor, you can reduce your broth with further boiling.

Heat a dash of oil up in a large soup pot or dutch oven.,
Add the ground turkey and bell peppers.,
Add the tomato puree and bouillon.,
Add the beans.,
Add the jalapeno, the spices, and a dash of Worcestershire sauce.,
Bring the pot to a boil.,
Serve it up!,
Finished.

",How to Make Turkey Bean Chili," Add the onions and allow them to start cooking for a couple of minutes.;
, Cook, stirring regularly, until the meat is no longer pink.


It isn't essential, but if desired, drain off any extra fat/juices once the meat is cooked.

, Stir it up so everything is evenly mixed.


If you have real stock on hand, feel free to use a cup of that instead of the powdered bouillon.
If you're a huge fan of tomato flavor, you can increase the amount of tomato in the recipe, up to double; however, if you're adding more tomato, you may want to skip the bouillon to avoid watering down the mixture too much.

, Make sure that all the beans, except the chili beans, are rinsed and drained; you want the chili beans to keep their spicy flavor, so dump in the liquid for that can, too.


If you love beans, feel free to add other varieties or extra cans; chickpeas/garbanzo beans and white beans also work well in this recipe.

, This combination makes a medium to spicy chili, so if you're looking for a more mild flavor, start with half the amount of jalapeno and spice and work your way up, tasting along the way.


If you accidentally over-spice, a dash of lime juice can help even out the flavor again, and it adds a little zesty flavor without adding heat.

, Then reduce the heat, cover and simmer for 20 minutes or more. As long as you keep an eye on it to prevent it drying out, you can keep it simmering for a lot longer without harm, especially if you prefer less liquid in your chili.

, Offer your guests some grated cheese, sour cream, and chopped green onions to go with the chili. Serve alongside some crusty bread or on top of rice, or pour a little over oven-baked fries and top with cheese for some homemade chili cheese fries.

Whisk together the tomato sauce and seasonings.,
Thin out the sauce with water.,
Adjust the seasonings.,
Chill for several hours.,
Serve cool or at room temperature.",How to Make Taco Sauce1," In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the tomato sauce, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, apple cider vinegar, and honey. Mix until smooth and evenly combined.Use plain tomato sauce, not tomato sauce previously seasoned with other herbs and spices. Using a flavored tomato sauce can throw off the final taste of the taco sauce.
Start with the minimum amount of honey and cayenne pepper during this step—1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of honey and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) cayenne pepper. You can make the sauce sweeter or spicier later on, if desired.;
, Whisk in the water, roughly 2 Tbsp (30 ml) at time, until the sauce reaches your desired consistency.


You'll likely need at least 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water to bring the sauce to an appropriately thin consistency, but don't feel obligated to add the full 1/2 cup (125 ml) of you prefer slightly thicker taco sauce.

, Taste the sauce using a clean spoon. Add more cayenne pepper or honey, as needed, to adjust the flavor so that it matches your personal sense of taste.


If you accidentally add too much of either one, you can usually balance out the flavor by adding more of the other. For instance, if you accidentally make the sauce too spicy, adding more honey can balance out the heat and make it easier to tolerate.

, Cover the bowl of taco sauce with plastic wrap and place it in your refrigerator for approximately 2 to 3 hours.This step isn't strictly necessary; you can technically serve the sauce immediately after whisking it together. Giving it time to rest, however, allows the flavors to mix together and may create a more balanced taste.

, Depending on your own preference, you can serve the sauce straight from the refrigerator or let it drop back down to room temperature before enjoying it.


If you decide to serve the sauce at room temperature, simply remove the portion you intend to use and let it sit out on the counter for roughly 20 minutes before use.
Leftovers can be refrigerated for up to 5 days. You can also freeze the taco sauce in an airtight, freezer-safe container for several months.

Avoid the four Whites: 1) Meat (referring to the white fat, saturated fat, found in meat).,
Read the nutrition labels on all packaged foods.,
Avoid products containing high fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated vegetable oil if they're one of the top five ingredients.,
Avoid false claims.",How to Shop for Healthy Food," 2) Sugar (referring to refined white sugar found in 95% of all food found in a typical grocery store). 3) Salt. Small quantities of sodium are necessary, but it's very easy to overdose. 4) White flour. This includes anything with white breading: 98% of all breads sold at supermarkets, bagels, muffins, 'hot pockets', pizza, crackers, cookies, etc. If the ingredients say 'enriched', then the bread likely is missing fiber, antioxidants, and certain vitamins and minerals, and should thus be avoided.;
, A cereal might advertise 1/3 less sugar, but that does not tell you how many grams of sugar are still in a serving. Always choose a product with lower sugar and fat contents.

, It is believed that these foods are both contributing factors to obesity. Hydrogenated vegetable oil has been shown to contribute to heart disease, which is a leading killer for Americans.

, Very little of what is claimed on a package is actually regulated. If the product claims to be healthful, check the ingredients list. You might be getting scammed.

Cook the tomato paste and water.,
Add the seasonings.,
Adjust the flavor.,
Simmer until thickened.,
Serve warm or cold.",How to Make Taco Sauce2," Place the two ingredients in a medium saucepan set over medium heat. Whisk them together until they form a smooth, even mixture.Using hot water and whisking the tomato base over constant heat should help break down the tomato paste more thoroughly, making it easier to blend it into a smooth base.
When ready, the tomato base should have the consistency of a relatively thin tomato sauce.

, Add the minced onion flakes, garlic powder, cumin, paprika, dried oregano, white vinegar, sugar, and red pepper flakes to the tomato base. Whisk to combine.


Start with the minimum amount of sugar—1/4 tsp (1.25 ml)—to avoid making the sauce too sweet. Similarly, start with the minimum amount of red pepper flakes—1/4 tsp (1.25 ml)—to avoid making the sauce too spicy.

, Taste the taco sauce using a clean spoon. If necessary, add more sugar or red pepper flakes to the sauce to achieve the flavor profile you prefer.


To create a mild taco sauce, stick with the minimum amount of red pepper and increase the amount of sugar up to 1 tsp (5 ml).
To create a hot taco sauce, stick with the minimum amount of sugar and increase the amount of red pepper flakes up to 1 tsp (5 ml).
For medium heat, experiment with the amount of sugar and red pepper flakes a little at a time, using a clean spoon to test the flavor after each addition. If you add too much of either seasoning, you might be able to help balance out the excess by adding more of the other.

, Reduce the heat to low and simmer the taco sauce uncovered for 15 to 20 minutes, or until it thickens to your desired consistency.Periodically stir the taco sauce to prevent it from burning.
Note that longer simmer times will create thicker sauce.
In addition to thickening the sauce, this step also causes the flavors to blend together, creating a more complex flavor profile as a result.

, Remove the taco sauce from the heat and let it cool slightly. You can serve it while it's still warm or cool it completely prior to enjoying it.


Allow the sauce to drop to room temperature before transferring it to the refrigerator to chill.
Store leftover taco sauce in an airtight container kept in the refrigerator. It should remain good for up to 5 days.
To store the sauce for several months, pour it into a freezer-safe airtight container and stick it in the freezer. Thaw before use.

Look for leeks that have long, white stems.,
Prefer leeks that have all or some of the roots still attached.,
Avoid buying leeks that are yellowed, split, or which have crispy or wilted leaves.,
Prepare your leeks.,
Use the leeks as required by your recipe.,
Consider these ideas to try with leeks:


Add to risotto, soup, pies, casserole dishes, pasta sauce, omelettes;
Grill (broil) half lengths of leek brushed with garlic oil and balsamic vinegar.",How to Select and Use Leeks," The best size for leeks is medium and they should appear crisp.;
, The presence of the roots indicates that the leek is still intact; if the base of the leek has been cut, the flesh begins to dry out.

, These leeks are not in their prime. If they are on a good special, however, they will do as a soup or stock base.

,


Start with the root end. Trim off the roots and the end that joins the roots.
Remove the outer leaves that are tough or dry - these leaves are usually a darker green.
Hold each leek under running water to flush out the dirt that becomes trapped between the leek leaf layers. It helps if you can fan out the leaves as you wash.

, Be conscious to cook leeks long enough - they can be very tough and stringy if undercooked. Equally, avoid cooking for too long or you will end up with a mushy consistency. If steaming or baking, only cook until tender. And for baking, always add moisture to the dish, whether it be water, stock, or juices from other food.

, Top with shave Parmesan cheese.
Bake leeks in water and lemon juice sprinkled with freshly milled black pepper;
Steam finely chopped or baby leeks and toss in a favourite dressing. Add fresh herbs as a garnish;
Sauté in butter and garlic.

Identify the need for a food pantry in your city or state.,
Choose a steering committee or board of directors.,
Research your state or country's regulations for food banks.,
Get tax-exemption status, if you plan to be a charitable food pantry.,
Find a building to house the food pantry.,
Come up with a budget.,
Stock your pantry keeping in mind the nutritional needs of the people you would like to help.,
Transport the food to local people in need.,
Set up a marketing strategy.,
Make sure your staff, CPA and lawyer keep very detailed records of all that you do at your organization.",How to Set Up a Food Pantry," If you do not, you may find that you are competing with other local food banks and religious charities, which would do harm to both. Once you assess the needs of the community, it will be easier to work toward meeting them.


Define a mission for your food bank. This could be a religious, secular or community-based mission statement. It should lead the goals of your organization and help other people to be inspired to get involved.;
, This can be as easy as a couple of friends deciding to start a small bank or asking more important members of the government and community to be on your board. It would be a good idea to ask an attorney and a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) to be part of your organization to oversee the paperwork.

, This information is usually available through another local food charity. Call to ask how they comply with the state's standards.


See if there is a Food Bank Network in your state. If so, they may provide a guide to setting up a new food bank in your town.

, This requires you to file for 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization status with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Your CPA can help to obtain this status by filling out governmental forms.

, This could be anything from a sturdy storage shed to a warehouse. This building may need to have temperature controls to keep it cold enough for food storage, and it may need to abide by other regulations.

, This should cover costs for food, food distribution, leases and organizational expenses. The budget may need to change as the months progress, but you should have an initial amount of money needed to support your pantry.

, Ask for food donations of canned goods, bread, fresh fruit and vegetables. Let the people know that their donations are tax deductible.


Some food banks ask local farms to donate any surplus produce to their food pantry. You must keep in mind that this food must be distributed fairly quickly.
Invest in a freezer if possible. Meat, bread and other items will need to be frozen until there is time to distribute them.
Be specific about the type of goods that you need. Many food pantries suffer for certain types of food and must buy them when their stock is low. You may also want to consider accepting coats or other food items.

, You may be able to rely on volunteers to distribute the food or you may need to buy your own van. Set up regular donation periods and times when people can come by the food pantry to ask for donations.

, Let the community know how, what and when donations are needed. Set up social media accounts and ask for volunteers regularly. Many high school and college students are required to have volunteer hours.

, Charities are often subject to audits by the IRS.

Choose a firm choko.,
Select chokos of singular color.,
Select smaller fruit.",How to Select and Use Chokos (Chayote Squash)1," Find one that’s not too soft, about the texture of a pepper. Try to avoid those overly wrinkled as well. You should also avoid substantial bruising or blemishes., Light green is preferred. While chokos can range from a darker green to white, you want to be sure to select one that is not multi-colored.The multi-coloring is a sign of aging, and a white typically means it’s overly ripe.In some countries, the large, white chokos are simply used to replant or to feed animals.

, The fruit should be small, roughly 6cm long, and without any bruising or indentation. This size indicates a younger fruit. The larger chokos are less flavorful, and somewhat unappetizing.

Deep fry choko.",How to Select and Use Chokos (Chayote Squash)2," Use plastic bags to keep them stored in the vegetable crisper of your refrigerator. Chokos will last anywhere from 10 days to a few weeks., Larger chokos are typically older, and they should be peeled before cooking. The peel is often sticky, so gloves are a good idea. Or running water can be used while peeling to minimize the feel of it.Small chokos, about the size of an egg, can be eaten raw. They can also be tossed straight into salads, stews, and soups.

, The fruit itself is rarely served whole. Some dishes call for halving, quartering, or dicing. Once it’s been peeled, cut it as required for the recipe. The seeds should be removed unless you want a slightly nutty flavor.

, Peel and dice the chokos to a size they can be added to stews. Once the stew is mature, add in the choko chunks. By putting in the chokos late, you’ll keep some of the firmness and the flavor of the stew will be absorbed., Chokos are delightful when minimally prepared. Peel, halve, and steam your chokos until tender. Once they are the right firmness, add some lemon or lime juice, and finish with some butter or olive oil. Salt and pepper to taste. , Chokos often take on surrounding flavors. Peel and deseed the choko, then slice it as you would an apple. Try using a few chokos in your next apple pie for a cheaper option than apples and a hint of nutty flavor., You can fry thin slices of choko dipped in batter or beaten egg and breadcrumbs. Dip them into hot oil and fry until golden brown, like a fries or onion rings.

Consider the product to be packaged.,
When choosing packaging ensure without fail that it meets the legal requirements put in place for your country or for export requirements.,
Think about the practicality of your packaging.,
Ensure that the packaging is durable.,
Focus finally on design.,
Consider whether or not you want the food to be visible through the packaging or if you want it completely concealed.",How to Select Packaging for Your New Food Product," The first thing to consider when looking at food packaging is the product itself. Questions you need answers to include:


Does it have a place on the market?
How will it stand out from other foods already out there?
What sort of shape and consistency is it?
What sort of packaging will best contain it? 
Who is your target audience and how will you get this across?


Once you have this information sorted out and understood, you can begin to look at your packaging.





;
, Failure to do so could lead to prosecution or fines and a dent in your brand's reputation. Make this is a priority. At the most basic, the packaging should include:


The manufacturer's name and contact details
The name of the product
A description of the product
The weight of the product
A list of ingredients in the product
Instructions on how to cook/heat the food
Storage instructions
The shelf life of the product
The product's place of origin
Allergy information
Nutritional information
A bar code.

, Foods come in all sorts of shapes, sizes and consistencies, so choosing packaging that is appropriate to your product is essential. For example:


If you are selling a liquid based product such as soup, you will need to ensure that the packaging is leakproof and sturdy, in order to avoid spillages.
Any products that you intend to be microwavable will need to be placed in packaging suitable for the microwave so that it can be handled accordingly. 
Dry foods such as cereals and pasta can be packaged in cardboard and plastic, depending on your preferences.

, The packaging you choose for your product should be able to protect the food whilst being transported. Some foods are transported for very long distances, particularly if they are being distributed across the world. To ensure that your food is protected, the chosen packaging should be strong, flexible, durable and weatherproof. This will ensure that your food is delivered in one piece when it arrives at its destination.

, As mentioned earlier, this aspect is vital for the successful selling of your product. The design will need to be bold, eye-catching, representative of the food and like nothing else already on the market.


If your target audience is children, the design should be bright and colourful, fun and easy to read. 
Organic produce tends to be advertised in earthy colours to advertise the fact that the food is natural.

, These are all things that will need to be discussed and taken seriously. In some cases, the food will determine the transparency or opacity of the packaging, as it may need to be protected from light or it may not present well if seen.

Look for spinach with green, crisp leaves.,
Check the stem and buy accordingly.,
Avoid bags or containers with excessive moisture.Excess moisture will cause the spinach to rot.They will also perish more quickly if stored in a wet plastic bag.,
Know that fresh spinach isn’t necessarily the best option.",How to Select and Store Spinach1," It should appear as if it were just picked, firm, and un-wilted. Buy organic and no-pesticide spinach if possible as most regular spinach has high levels of pesticide residue.Discard any spinach with blemishes or signs of rot, or yellowed or browned leaves.They are very unappetizing.1 pound of spinach will cook to about one cup of cooked spinach.;
, A thin, flexible stem indicates a younger plant, while a thick fibrous stem shows that it’s a more mature, tougher plant. Buy according to the recipe you're cooking for.Younger plants are better for salads and recipes where spinach is served raw.Thicker and mature spinach should be used for cooking.,


Ensure that your spinach is dry prior to purchasing.
Don't wash the spinach until you use it.

, Spinach will lose its nutritional value within days of being harvested. Canned and processed spinach are processed immediately after harvest.Canned or frozen spinach may retain more nutrients and vitamins than fresh spinach that’s been traveling for miles."

Store the spinach in its original packaging or in a dry plastic bag if you plan on eating it within a week.,
Store as cold as possible without freezing.,
Freeze the spinach to keep for several months.",How to Select and Store Spinach2," Place it in the refrigerator in the crisp drawer to save the greens for up to ten days.Containers will protect the greens from being moved around or crushed like they would in bags.Paper towels absorb the moisture, and keep your spinach fresh.Don't place it anywhere near ethylene-producing fruit, such as bananas or apples, or it will decay prematurely This means that an over-ripened apple or rotten fruit can cause the spinach to wilt and decay faster

, This method is fine if you eat the spinach within 3 to 7 days.Ensure that the moisture is removed by patting the spinach dry with a paper towel.
Leave a paper towel in the bag with the spinach to absorb excess moisture., Take care where you leave the spinach in the fridge. Spinach can freeze when stored at 32ºF or below. Ensure that the fridge temperature is higher than that.


Keep the fridge at 39 degrees Fahrenheit to prevent the loss of folate and carotenoid content in spinach.Storing spinach in the fridge will slow down its nutrient loss. Keeping the fridge at 50 degrees or higher will accelerate the loss of nutrients., With this method, you can keep the spinach for nine to 14 months.First, blanch the greens in boiling water for a minute or two, then cool in an ice water bath for the same amount of time. Drain the bath and squeeze the water out of the spinach by twisting it in your hands. Take about a handful and form the wet spinach into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic wrap, storing them in a large freezer bag. Freeze the spinach balls, and defrost for a ready-to-use serving of greens.If you use your spinach within six months, you can also freeze the spinach without blanching. This leads to a slimy product and is best used in dishes when cooking or baking.You can also wring the water, then place the spinach into freezer bags instead of making them into balls.Use a straw to suck out all the air or vacuum seal to prevent freezer burn."

Choose a heavy bulb.",How to Select and Store Kohlrabi1," Kohlrabi is at its peak from mid spring until mid fall., Look for kohlrabi bulbs that are approximately 3” in diameter, about the size of a tennis ball. The smaller bulbs are sweeter and more tender. Their taste is similar to peeled broccoli stems.Avoid larger bulbs as their taste will be sharper and more woody. They also have a thicker peel.

, Look for a kohlrabi bulb that has even skin without cracks or bruises., If buying a whole kohlrabi, with the leaves attached, opt for leaves that are dark green in color and firm to the touch. Kohlrabi plants with the leaves attached are often more fresh than the bulbs that have had their leaves removed.Avoid yellow or wilting leaves.

, While it is important to pay attention to the color of the leaves, the color of the bulb is less important. Kohlrabi bulbs can be white, green, crimson or purple. Once peeled, the inside of kohlrabi is always a pale yellow., The perfect kohlrabi bulb should be heavy and firm."

Purchase ripe tamarillos.,
Store.,
Prepare.,
Use the tamarillo.",How to Select and Store Tamarillos," Tamarillos should be fresh, with no green skin around the calyx. If there is green skin, this means that the fruit will not ripen and it will taste inferior. The flesh should be firm but slightly soft to a gentle touch.It should also be heavy for its size and unblemished. Ripe tamarillos are fragrant.

, Tamarillos can be stored at room temperature or in the refrigerator. If stored in the refrigerator, they will last up to two weeks; one week for those stored at room temperature.

, When using tamarillos, wash first. If you want to eat the flesh easily, scoop it out and eat with a spoon. For other uses, the tamarillo should be peeled. To peel it, cut a cross in the base. Blanch it to remove the skin quickly.


To remove the skin from a tamarillo, boil water in a saucepan and drop in the tamarillo for one minute. Remove and test if it peels easily (if not, boil for another minute). Place in a bowl of cold water, then peel once cold enough to handle.

, There are many uses for tamarillos. Not only can they be enjoyed as they are, scooped out of the skin but they are also great in chutneys, relishes, preserves, jams and sauces.


When cooking with tamarillos, always use stainless steel or enamel saucepans and knives. This will avoid discoloration.

Harvest African millet from the field.,
Hand-process the millet flour.,
Set aside a portion of dry millet flour to be added back in as the pellets form, to keep them from sticking.

,
Dribble water into the millet flour.,
Choose the pellet size needed.,
Scrape off flour from the bowl edges.,
Finish up and make use of the millet pellets.",How to Make Millet Flour Pellets from Millet Flour," First, separate the seeds from the stalks (usually by hand-beating with sticks). Then collect the seeds and either pound them with the large mortar and pestle or process then through a hulling machine in order to remove the hard outer hull. Then, either hand-grind with stones or process again through a grinding mill to produce flour. Sift the flour to remove debris. This is the flour that will be turned into millet pellets through a process of dampening and hand-working, which can then be cooked in recipes (the pellet process follows).

A side-by-side comparison of the similar-sized un-milled, milled and rolled millet pellets shows the difference. Side-by-side, you'll see that it is obvious that the un-milled seeds have a darker color than the hulled seeds.



 

;
, Set out two large bowls, (traditionally calabash gourds), a generous cup of water and a spoon or other hard edge as available for scraping the sides of the bowl as flour accumulates.

,, Work it through the flour to spread the dampness.  Scoop and turn your hand through the flour; doing this automatically forms the pellets. Add water and dry flour alternately, to dampen all of the flour.

, The millet flour develops a variety of pellet sizes. Millet couscous is a steamed recipe, requiring smaller pellets, but boiled porridges require larger pellets because they are less likely to disintegrate during the boiling process. The process of dampening, breaking up clumps and adding dry flour to keep the formed pellets from sticking must be repeated until all the millet flour has been converted to uniformly-sized millet-flour pellets.

, During this process, the millet flour will adhere to the calabash gourd walls, so scrape this off. 


Note: Metal bowls usually do not develop a build-up.

, In this case, only one size of pellet is required, so there are no sifting steps required. This process has produced in less than one hour of steady hand-working, about 5 kg of millet flour pellets suitable for a popular West African millet porridge. These millet pellets are ready to be sent to the kitchen to boil, put in the refrigerator (up to a week) or frozen for use some other day.

Note that the sugar is an optional ingredient. Add it if you like mildly sweetened cornbread. Leave it out if you prefer savory cornbread.;
, Toss both ingredients into the cornmeal mixture, stirring until the shortening melts and the mixture seems evenly combined.The resulting dough should be thick enough to loosely hold its form, but it will still be quite sticky and difficult to pick up with your hands.

, Scoop up heaping tablespoons of dough. Use your fingers or a second spoon to form them into flattened balls or patties.


You should be able to get roughly 10 to 15 patties out of this dough.
Place the formed patties on a plate lined with wax paper. Alternatively, wait until after you heat the oil, then form and drop the patties directly into the skillet.

, Pour 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of vegetable oil into a large, heavy-bottomed skillet. Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat.


Cast iron skillets work best, but any large, heavy-bottomed skillet can be used.
Note that bacon fat, canola oil, or peanut oil can also be used instead of standard vegetable oil.
Test the temperature of the oil with a cooking thermometer. When the oil reaches 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius), move onto the next step.

, Gently place each dough patty in the hot oil. Fry the patties for approximately 5 minutes, or until the patties are golden brown on both sides.Only turn the patty once during the cooking process. Wait 2 to 3 minutes, or until the bottom edge of each patty starts to brown. Use a flat, heat-resistant spatula to carefully flip the patties to their uncooked sides.

, Remove the patties from the hot oil using a slotted spatula and transfer them to a plate covered in paper towels.


Try to position the patties in a single layer on this plate. If you stack them on top of one another, the oil may not drain completely.
Let the cornbread patties drain for 1 or 2 minutes.

, Enjoy the cornbread patties while they're still hot. You can eat them plain or add butter, maple syrup, honey, or fruit preserves.

Drop spoonfuls of dough into the oil.,
Cook until lightly browned.,
Drain on paper towels.,
Serve hot.",How to Make Hot Water Cornbread2," Place the cornmeal, salt, and water in a medium mixing bowl. Stir the ingredients together until evenly combined.


Consider mixing the cornmeal and salt together before adding the water. Doing so is not strictly necessary but can ensure an even distribution of salt throughout the batter.
The resulting dough should be the consistency of thick oatmeal. It should have some form to it, but it will also be too sticky and fluid to touch with your hands. If it doesn't seem thin enough, add more boiling water 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time until it does.

, Pour 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of vegetable oil into a large cast iron skillet. Set the skillet on your stove over medium-high heat.


Other cooking oils, like peanut oil or bacon fat, can also work. Similarly, any large, heavy-bottomed skillet can be used if you don't have one made of cast iron.
The temperature of the oil should reach 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) before you add the dough. Test the temperature with a cooking thermometer. Alternatively, sprinkle the surface of the oil with a little water; if the oil immediately sizzles and the water turns to vapor, it's probably ready to use.

, Using a flatware teaspoon, drop spoonfuls of the prepared dough into the hot oil, pressing down gently on the center of each dollop after dropping it in.Tap on the center of the patty with the back of the spoon as soon as the dough hits the oil. Try to flatten it out as much as possible without separating the dough into different pieces.

, Fry the patties until both sides have browned, turning once when the edges brown.


Since these patties are so thin, they should only take 3 to 4 minutes to cook. Watch them closely to prevent them from burning.
The finished patties will be crisp and full of holes/indentation, giving them a ""lacy"" appearance.

, Remove the finished patties from the hot oil using a slotted spatula, then transfer them to a large plate lined with paper towels. Drain for several minutes.


Keep the cornbread pieces in a single layer, if possible. If you stack them on top of each other, the oil from top layer will drip down and soak into the pieces lying at the bottom.

, Enjoy the cornbread while it's still hot. You can eat it plain or serve it with salt and butter.

Gently sift the pan from side to side, or use a spatula to spread the oil all the way to the edges.

, Place the cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a medium mixing bowl. Stir gently until evenly combined.

, Pour the half-and-half and remaining 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of vegetable oil into the cornmeal mixture, stirring until just combined.

, Slowly pour the boiling water into the cornmeal mixture. Stir the batter together until it reaches the consistency of thick grits or oatmeal.


Stir with one hand while pouring with the other. If you aren't able to do so, simply add the water in small amounts, stirring in between each addition.
You may need anywhere from 3/4 to 1-1/4 cups (180 to 310 ml) of boiling water depending on the coarseness of the cornmeal used. Stop adding water once the batter reaches the correct consistency.

, Drop dollops of batter into the prepared jelly roll pan and directly into the oil. Each portion of batter should measure approximately 1/4 cup (60 ml) in volume.


This recipe should produce eight cornbread patties, so keep that in mind as you space the dollops of dough. Try to keep at least 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of space in between the patties.

, Place the pan in your oven and bake the cornbread patties for 17 to 20 minutes, or until golden brown on both sides.


To ensure even browning, cooking the patties on one side for 12 to 15 minutes, then flip them over to the other side and finish cooking an additional 5 minutes.

, Remove the pan from the oven and lift the cornbread patties out of the oil. Transfer them to a plate lined with clean paper towels.


This method doesn't use quite as much oil as stovetop frying requires, so there won't be as much oil to drain. Quickly dab both sides of each patty on the paper towels to remove most of the excess oil sitting on the surface.

, Enjoy the cornbread patties immediately. You can eat them plain, but you may also wish to serve them with salt, butter, honey, or preserves.

",How to Make Meatloaf in a Muffin Pan," In one teaspoon of olive oil, sauté your onions, carrots, and garlic over medium heat. You should cook the vegetables and garlic until they're slightly soft. This should only take about 2 minutes. It's not necessary to cook the vegetables until they're limp or caramelized., From here, the recipe is simple. You will add the cooked vegetables to the remaining ingredients. The meat, eggs, crackers, and spices should all be gently mixed together with the vegetables and garlic. Mix until all the ingredients are evenly dispersed throughout the meat., Cut your parchment paper into 2-inch wide strips. Cut out enough strips to fill each compartment of your muffin tin.Set a strip over each compartment of the tray.
Push the strips down so about two inches of parchment paper come up on the side of the muffin tray.
This way, you can easily remove the sections of meatloaf after cooking.

, Use your ice cream scooper here. Scoop out a generous portion of the meat loaf mixture. Fill each compartment of the muffin tray to the top with the mixture.After filling each compartment of the tray, round out the tops of each section of meatloaf using the back of your ice cream scooper. You want to form a dome-like top, something like a cupcake.

, If you want to add some flavor, you can use a cooking brush to brush a bit of barbecue sauce over the top of each section of meat loaf. However, this is optional. You may prefer meatloaf with less flavor.If you don't like barbecue sauce, you can use another sauce you feel would go well with meatloaf.

, Place the tray in an oven heated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. You will need to bake your meatloaf for around 15 to 20 minutes before you can remove it from the oven. Make sure to let the meat loaf cool before serving it.To check if meatloaf has cooked through, use a meat thermometer. The temperature in the middle of the meatloaf should be at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit.

, You should always take precautions when handling raw meat. Wear plastic gloves as you're kneading ingredients into your meat. When you're done, dispose of the gloves.You should also make sure to wash utensils used to handle raw meat with hot water and soap.Be sure to clean off any kitchen surfaces that had contact with raw meat. It's best to use paper towels, which can be discarded. If you use cloth towels, wash them in the hot cycle of your washing machine after use.

, A lot of fat will rise to the top of your individual portions of meat loaf. Use a knife or a fork to scrape off any fat. This will cut down on calories, as well as things like saturated fat, making the dish healthier., If you're on a specific diet plan, you can use any meatloaf recipe to make meatloaf in a muffin tin. If you, for example, want something like low fat or paleo friendly meatloaf, simply make your regular meatloaf recipe and then cook the meatloaf in a muffin tin.Make sure to use a meat thermometer to assure the meat loaf is cooked throughout.

Preheat the oven or oil.,
Boil the water.,
Add the other ingredients.,
Scoop the mixture onto a baking sheet.,
Flatten the chips.,
Cook the chips.,
Serve.",How to Make Corn Chips1," These chips are healthier if you bake them in an oven, but if you want corn chips with a store-bought taste and appearance, you'll need to deep-fry them in oil.


When baking the chips, preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).
When frying the chips, pour 1/2 inch (2.5 cm) of oil into a heavy skillet with high sides and heat it on medium high over the stove. Continue heating the oil until it reaches a temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius).;
, Bring 3/4 cup (185 ml) water to a boil in a kettle or small saucepan. Set it on the stove over high heat until a notable boil develops.


For thinner corn chips, you could increase the amount of water to 7/8 cup (210 ml).
You could also boil the water in a microwave, but do so slowly and carefully to prevent the water from super-heating.

, Pour the boiling water into a medium mixing bowl. Add the cornmeal, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) corn or other vegetable oil, and salt to the water and mix together with clean hands or a wooden mixing spoon until well combined.


If you want to add other seasonings, as well, you should do so at this time.

For something mild, try 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ground black pepper.
For something with more of a kick, try 1 Tbsp (15 ml) chili powder, 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) garlic powder or onion powder, or 1 tsp (5 ml) of a steak or hamburger spice rub.
Think about your favorite corn chip flavors. Experiment with different seasonings based on these flavors.



, Take a 1-tsp (5-ml) measuring spoon and scoop out a heaping dollop of the chip mix. Place the spoonful on a well-greased baking sheet. Scoop out the remainder of the chips and do the same.


Use plenty of oil or cooking spray on the baking sheet when you grease it. The sheet needs to be very stick-resistant.
You could also line the baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil.
Do not allow the corn chip dollops to touch.

, Moisten your fingers with a little water or cooking oil. Press on the corn chip dollops and flatten them out into thin rectangles or ovals.


If your fingers start to stick to the batter as you work, re-moisten them before continuing.
Again, the corn chips must not touch each other.

, As noted earlier, you can either bake or fry these chips.


Bake the corn chips. If you have decided to bake the chips in your preheated oven, place the baking sheet in the oven and cook the chips for roughly 10 minutes. The chips are done when they are hard and look golden-brown. Allow them to cool on the baking sheet.
Fry the corn chips. If you would rather fry the corn chips, carefully dip a few flattened strips of batter into your hot oil. Only fry a few at a time to prevent overcrowding. Fry them for 1 to 3 minutes on one side, flip, then fry for another 1 to 2 minutes on the other side. When done, the chips should look crispy, golden, and curled around the edges. Pull the chips out of the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on layers of clean paper towels.

, Wait until the chips cool to the touch and enjoy.

"

Preheat the oil or oven.,
Dry the tortilla shells.,
Cut each tortilla into wedges.,
Cook the chips.,
Season with salt and serve.",How to Make Corn Chips2," You can fry, bake, or microwave these corn tortilla chips. If you plan on frying or baking the chips, though, you should preheat the cooking elements before preparing the chips.


If frying your chips, pour 1/4 inch (1.25 cm) of cooking oil into a dry skillet with a heavy bottom and deep sides. Heat the oil on medium high until it reaches a temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius). Do not allow the oil to begin smoking, however.
If baking the chips, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).

, Corn tortilla chips made from tortilla shells are easier to fry if they are completely dry. If you plan on baking or microwaving the chips, though, you do not need to worry about drying the tortillas out first.


Open the package of tortillas and spread them out in a single layer on a clean kitchen counter. Let them dry for several hours to overnight.
Alternatively, dry them in the microwave. Lay the tortillas out in a single layer on a paper towel and microwave for 20 to 60 seconds. They should only be dry when finished, not crisp.

, Use a pizza cutter or sharp kitchen knife to cut each tortilla into six equal wedges. Cut the tortilla in half, then divide each half into three even pieces, working out from the center point.


These wedges should be fairly triangular in shape.
You can experiment with other shapes and sizes, as well, including strips or smaller wedges. Keep in mind that the sizes of your chips should be fairly equal to ensure an even cook time for each batch.

, As stated previously, these chips can be fried, baked, or microwaved.


To fry the chips, place a handful of your wedges into the hot oil, keeping them to a single layer. Fry for 2 minutes or until the chips deepen in color and become hard. Remove the chips with a slotted spoon or tongs and line them up on a plate covered with layers of clean paper towel.

Keep an eye on the temperature of the oil as you fry your chips. When you add your chips to the oil, the temperature will drop. When you remove the chips, the temperature will rise. Adjust the temperature controls of your oven accordingly to maintain an even temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).


To bake the chips, spread the wedges out onto a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Keep them in a single layer. Bake for 6 minutes, then turn them over using tongs and bake for another 6 to 9 minutes. The chips are done once they become firm and start to deepen in color.
To microwave the chips, line the microwave with paper towels and spread the chips out over the paper towels in a single layer. Microwave for 30 seconds to 2 minutes, or until the chips look crispy but not burnt.

, Sprinkle the chips with salt, to taste, as soon as they finish cooking. Let them cool to room temperature and enjoy.

Preheat the oven.,
Combine the masa harina and salt.,
Add the water.,
Form the dough into a ball.,
Divide the dough into smaller sections.,
Flatten the dough out.,
Cut each round into wedges.,
Bake.,
Serve.",How to Make Corn Chips3," Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).


Meanwhile, prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil. If neither are on hand, you could coat the baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray, instead.

, In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the masa harina and salt until well combined. Use clean hands or a mixing spoon.


Note that masa harina is a traditional Mexican corn flour. If you cannot find masa harina, use another corn flour. Do not use corn starch or cornmeal.

, Gradually add hot water to the masa harina mix, stirring continually to combine the ingredients. Stop adding water once a dough forms.


The water only needs to be hot; it does not need to be boiling.
You will likely end up using between 1/2 cup (125 ml) and 3/4 cup (185 ml) water.
Stir the dough with a spatula to make sure that the ingredients are thoroughly blended together. The dough should not be able to crack or fall apart.
After stirring the ingredients together, knead it a few times with your hands.

, Use your hands to pack the dough into a solid ball. Allow it to sit in a warm, dry area for 30 to 60 minutes.

, After enough time has passed, divide the ball of dough into eight even sections. Roll each of these sections into balls.

, Lay out a sheet of parchment paper. Place a small ball of dough on top of it, then cover it with another piece of parchment paper. Use the bottom of a plate or pan to flatten the ball into a circle that is less than 1/4 inch (6 mm) thin.


Repeat this same procedure with the other seven balls of dough.
If you do not have parchment paper, plastic wrap or plastic bags could also be used.
If you need to apply more force to flatten out the dough, you could roll over the plate with a rolling pin or otherwise set something heavy on top of it.
After the dough has been flattened sufficiently, carefully peel off the parchment paper or plastic.

, Divide each round into six even, triangular wedges. Use a knife or pizza cutter to cut them up. Arrange the wedges onto your prepared baking sheet in a single layer.


For best results, spray or coat the unbaked corn tortilla chips with a little olive oil. You may also sprinkle them with additional salt, to taste.

, Place the corn chips in your preheated oven and bake them for about 10 minutes. When done, they should look golden in color and have a crispy texture.

, Allow the corn tortilla chips to cool until they are safe to touch. Share with friends or enjoy the chips on your own.

Line the pan with a piece of foil, and lightly spray the foil with nonstick cooking spray to keep the fudge from sticking.If you prefer, you can use softened butter or shortening to grease the foil in the pan.;
, Transfer 1 medium banana that’s been mashed to a measuring cup. Add enough whole milk to the cup to measure ¾ cup (177 ml) of liquid, which should be approximately ½ cup (118 ml) of milk.Using whole milk will create the creamiest fudge, so it’s best not to use a milk with less fat.

, Once the banana and milk are combined, transfer them to medium saucepan. Add 2 ¼ cup (450 g) of granulated sugar and ½ teaspoon (2 g) of salt and stir a bit to mix the ingredients slightly., Place the saucepan with the banana mixture on the stove, and heat on medium-high. Stir the mixture constantly until the sugar dissolves, which should take approximately 5 to 7 minutes.To prevent sugar crystals from forming, wipe down the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush periodically.

, After the sugar has dissolved, allow the mixture to come to a boil. When it begins to boil, add a candy thermometer to pot and cook the mixture until it reaches 230 degrees Fahrenheit (110 degrees Celsius).If you don’t have a candy thermometer, a deep fry thermometer can also work.

, Once the banana mixture has reached the right temperature, take the saucepan off the heat. Add 1 ½ cups (265 g) of chocolate chips, ½ cup (113 g) of unsalted butter cut into cubes, ¼ teaspoon (1 ml) of banana extract, and 1 cup (50 g) of miniature marshmallows to the pan. Mix the ingredients until the chocolate and marshmallows melt and the mixture is smooth.You can use whatever type of chocolate chips you prefer for the fudge, such as milk, semi-sweet, or bittersweet.

, When the fudge mixture is completely smooth, use a rubber spatula to scrape it into the prepared baking pan and spread it into an even layer. Cover the pan with a piece of plastic wrap, and chill the fudge for at least 3 hours, or until it is set.If you prefer, you can allow the fudge to set at room temperature. Cover it and let it sit overnight until it is set.

, Once the fudge has set, lift it out of the pan using the foil. Peel the foil away from the fudge, and use a knife to cut it into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces to serve.Store any leftover fudge in an airtight container, and keep it in the refrigerator. It should stay fresh for up to a month.
Before you eat any refrigerated fudge, it’s a good idea to let it sit out for 15 to 30 minutes to bring it to room temperature first.

Stir the ingredients together but don’t worry about fully combining them.For the best chocolate shell sauce, use 66 to 72% dark chocolate.
Be sure to use refined coconut oil, which has more of a neutral flavor. If you use an unrefined or virgin coconut oil, your chocolate sauce will have a coconut flavor.
The corn syrup helps add sweetness and a fudge-like texture to the sauce. However, you can omit it if you prefer.;
, After you’ve mixed the ingredients, place the bowl in the microwave. Heat the mixture at 50% power in 15 second intervals, stirring after each. Continue heating the sauce until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth.It usually takes 3 to 4 intervals of heating the ingredients to melt the chocolate.
If you heat the ingredients too long, the chocolate may break and brown speckles can form in the sauce. To re-emulsify it, process it in a blender on high for 30 seconds.

, To apply the shell sauce like the store-bought version, it’s easier to keep it in a squeeze bottle. Pour the sauce into a clean bottle and store it at room temperature.While you can purchase a new squeeze bottle at many home goods stores, you can also wash out a bottle from an old container of store-bought chocolate shell sauce for your homemade version.
You can also store the sauce in a simple jar or tupperware container, and use a spoon to drizzle it over your ice cream.

, When you are ready to enjoy the chocolate shell sauce, drizzle it over a bowl of ice cream. Let the sauce sit for approximately 30 seconds so it has time to harden before eating.The chocolate shell sauce will keep for 3 to 4 months at room temperature, though it may separate over time.

Mix the ingredients well so they’re fully blended.Start out with just a teaspoon (5 ml) of the chocolate-flavored liquid stevia and taste the sauce. If it isn’t as sweet as you’d like, mix in more until the sauce reaches the sweetness level that you want.
You can usually find chocolate-flavored liquid stevia at health food stores and natural grocery stores. It’s also available at a variety of online retailers.

, When the sauce is completely mixed, transfer it to an airtight jar. To use it, spoon it over your favorite ice cream and wait at least 30 seconds for the sauce to harden into a shell before eating.You can store the sauce at room temperature, where it will keep for about 2 to 3 months.
The sauce can last up to 6 months in the refrigerator, but it will also solidify at colder temperatures. If you're plan to store it in the fridge, reheat for 30 seconds in the microwave before pouring it over ice cream.

Know what Dalia is.,
Heat one tablespoon of oil or ghee in a pressure cooker.,
Chop your vegetables.,
Add the chopped onion to the hot oil and cumin seeds.,
Add the other chopped vegetables to the pressure cooker.,
Rinse the dalia.,
Add four cups of water to the pressure cooker.,
Close the lid of the pressure cooker.,
Pour the dalia into bowls for serving.,
Finished.

",How to Make Dalia," Dalia is the Hindi word for broken cereals. This is dish in particular is made with broken wheat. Dalia is low in cholesterol and fat, and is a good source of carbs, iron and fiber. This dish has a porridge-like texture.;
, When the oil gets hot, add one teaspoon of cumin seeds. Let the cumin splutter in the oil. Listen for the cumin seeds to start crackling before you continue—the cracking signifies that they are releasing their flavor.


If you do not have a pressure cooker, you can try cooking dalia in a large pan. Follow the same steps as you would with a pressure cooker, adding the oil and then the cumin seeds.

,

If you are making dalia with vegetables, now is the time to rinse and prepare your veggies. Standard (and tasty) additions to dalia include onions, tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, and peas. Make sure you rinse your veggies before you use them.Chop one medium sized tomato and one medium sized onion.
Peel and chop a half cup of carrots. Wash and chop a half cup of potatoes.
Shell a half cup of peas (or you can buy pre-shelled frozen peas).

, Sauté the onion until it becomes clear. To add flavor, you can sauté the onion with one pinch of chopped ginger and one or two chopped green chilies.

, When the onion has become clear, sauté the vegetables for roughly two minutes, stirring constantly.

, Like rice, dalia is best if it is rinsed before cooking. Add one cup of rinsed dalia to the pressure cooker and sauté with the vegetables for three or four minutes. Make sure that you are stirring constantly so that the dalia does not stick to the inside of the pressure cooker.


You can also dry roast the dalia in a separate pan before you add it to the pressure cooker.

, Stir all of the ingredients together and add as much salt as you like (this is based on personal preference).

, Cook the dalia for 10 to 12 whistles or until it has developed a porridge-like consistency. If you open the lid and notice that your dalia does not look fully cooked, add a bit more water and continue to pressure cook for several more whistles.If your dalia is looking undercooked, you can also add water and continue to cook it with the top of the pressure cooker off until the dalia becomes soft.

, It should be served hot. Garnish your dish with a couple coriander leaves. Enjoy!

If you refrigerate it, reheat it for 30 seconds in the microwave before using, though, because it will harden at lower temperatures.

, When you’re ready to use the white chocolate shell sauce, use a spoon to drizzle it over a bowl of ice cream. Wait about 30 seconds for shell to harden before eating.You can also use the white chocolate shell sauce to coat homemade popsicles.

Get creative.,
Make a large salad.,
Throw together some easy tacos.,
Make gourmet sandwiches.,
Make a broccoli salad.,
Create a meat and cheese platter.,
Purchase some pre-made side dishes.",How to Make Dinner Without a Kitchen," One of the key strategies for cooking without a kitchen is to buy smaller quantities more often. Instead of stocking up on everything you’ll need for a week or two, make smaller purchases and more frequent trips to the store.For fresh items, purchase only what you can eat without refrigerating.;
, If you don’t have a kitchen that probably means you don’t have a refrigerator. To keep your food from spoiling, you should consider purchasing items that don’t need to be refrigerated – like canned goods or dried food.Dried fruits, rice cakes, nuts, canned vegetables, canned meat (tuna, chicken, etc.), peanut butter, and honey are great options for making dinner or a snack without a kitchen.

, Without a kitchen, there’s no way to cook your meat or other protein sources. You can find pre-cooked shrimp, lobster, or chicken in most grocery stores. You can even purchase some smoked tofu to add to your meals for a nice source of protein.Remember that even pre-cooked meat needs to be refrigerated, so only purchase what you want to eat that day.

, If you’re staying in a hotel, you might have access to a coffee maker or clothes iron that you could use to cook some food. You can use the coffee pot to boil water to make instant rice, ramen noodles, boil eggs, or even to add hot water to instant packages (like mashed potatoes).


You can wrap a sandwich or quesadilla in aluminum foil and apply the clothes iron to heat it up and melt the cheese.

, Purchase enough fresh veggies and condiments for one meal, whether it’s just for you or for your family and guests also. Rinse all of the produce in the sink (even in the bathroom sink is fine, as long as it’s clean) and let them dry on a paper towel or napkin.Choose a variety of lettuce types, add some pre-cooked grilled chicken, and throw in some extras like cashews, sliced avocado, pre-cooked boiled eggs, cherry tomatoes, sliced bell peppers. Top with a tasty vinaigrette dressing.

, Purchase a small bag of shredded cheese, a small container of salsa, some taco shells, a package of pre-cooked chicken, and a bit of shredded lettuce. You can combine all of these together to make some delicious tacos without the use of any kitchen devices.You can also consider adding some other vegetables to create a more flavorful finished product – like jalapenos, peppers, or even some avocado.

, Purchase some bread, some sliced deli meat, sliced cheese, and a dressing or condiment of your choice. You might consider adding Dijon mustard or light mayonnaise. Add some lettuce, sliced tomatoes, and a pickle wedge.Remember to only purchase what you can use that day. Any leftover meat or cheese will need to be refrigerated.
If you want something a little more simple, you can make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches or peanut butter and honey sandwiches. Consider adding sliced bananas to peanut butter and honey sandwiches.

, In a large mixing bowl, combine 1⁄4  c (59 mL) of mayonnaise, 1⁄4  c (59 mL) of sour cream, 1 teaspoon of sugar, 2 teaspoons of cider vinegar, 4  c (950 mL) of chopped broccoli, one 8 oz (230 g) can of sliced water chestnuts, one minced clove of garlic, 3 tablespoons of dried cranberries, and a dash of pepper. Mix the ingredients together and serve.You can make this recipe healthier by using low-fat mayonnaise and reduced-fat sour cream.

, This is a nice, filling addition to any meal that involves no cooking. Simply prepare an assortment of sliced meats and cheeses, with accompanying bread or crackers. You can even add some pickled veggies for additional flavor options.Try including some sliced prosciutto, sliced turkey, some salami, sliced provolone and asiago cheese, and some gherkins, cocktail onions, and artichoke hearts.
Don’t forget to include some nice bread (like a French-style baguette) to accompany the meat and cheese.

, Most grocery stores have an assortment of pre-packaged side dishes all ready to go. Consider purchasing something served cold so you won’t need to heat it up – like macaroni salad, potato salad, pasta salad, chips and salsa or guacamole, or even a lentil salad.Remember that some of these items should be refrigerated after opening, so avoid purchasing more than you can eat in one sitting.

Use whole milk, rather than diluted milk or low fat milk.,
Look for plain yogurt that has no gelatin in it.,
Adjust the amount of yogurt you use based on the climate.,
Make sure the dahi has time to set.,
Place a small round pot on the stove.,
Warm the milk.,
Add 1 ½ teaspoons yogurt.,
Transfer the dahi to a container with a lid.,
Let the covered dahi set in a warm place for 7-8 hours.,
Refrigerate the dahi.,
Enjoy the dahi in a curry, a lassi, or on its own.",How to Make Dahi," Using milk other than whole milk will create a curd that does not set properly and it will be watery, rather than firm.If you use homogenized milk, you will need more yogurt, as the milk is processed and the particles in the milk have been broken down.
If you use non-homogenized milk, you will need less yogurt as the dahi will set well. Adding too much yogurt will make your dahi very sour.;
, If the yogurt you use as your starter does have gelatin, you will likely how to use more of it in the dahi., If you live in a cold place, add more starter yogurt. If you live in a hot place, add less starter yogurt, or else the dahi will become sour., To make dahi with a nice, firm texture, you will need to let the dahi sit for about 7-8 hours. Depending on your climate, the dahi may set earlier than 7-8 hours., Pour the milk into the pot and set the burner to medium low heat., Do not make the milk too hot. Let it become lukewarm. Check the milk with your finger to make sure it is lukewarm.If the milk is too hot when you add the yogurt, it will be watery and not set.

, Once the milk becomes lukewarm, add the curd and mix it in well with a spoon or a whisk.Alternatively, you can pour milk from one container to another 2-3 times so the curd mixes well with the milk.

, Don’t let the dahi set in the pot you cooked it in. The heat of the pot will not allow the dahi to set. Choose a glass container or a metal container with an airtight lid.You can also set the curd in individual cups.

, By your oven or on your kitchen counter are good places for the dahi to set.If you live in a warmer place, the dahi will likely set within 5-6 hours.
If you live in a colder place,you can set the dahi in a casserole dish and add more starter yogurt, about 1 tablespoon. Then, you can cover the container with a thick towel or cloth.
You can also preheat the oven to 180 degrees C for two minutes. Then, switch off the oven and keep the dahi in the oven for 6-7 hours or overnight.If the curd does not set after 6-8 hours, or overnight, you likely used too little starter yogurt, the milk was not warm enough, or the temperature was not warm enough. So adjust these in your next batch of dahi.

, It will become firm after 2-3 hours. If you leave the dahi out longer than 8 hours to set (unless you live in a cold climate) and do not refrigerate it, it will become sour.If your curd comes out stringy and gooey, the temperature of the milk was likely too hot or too cold. So adjust the temperature to lukewarm for your next batch of dahi.
To avoid the dahi from getting watery or “breaking”, always level off the dahi if you break it and take a piece of it. Don’t let the dahi sit with a slanted top., Dahi tastes great with simple ingredients like cut up fruit and nuts in the morning, as well as an additive to Indian curries."

Heat oil on the stove.,
Fry the onion and garlic.,
Add dry rice and curry powder.,
Add water and salt.,
Heat to a boil.,
Simmer over low heat.,
Fluff and serve.",How to Make Curry Rice1," Add the oil to a wide, sturdy saucepan and place it over a burner set to medium-high. Heat until shimmering or you just barely notice smoke.;
, Transfer these vegetables to the hot pan. They should start to sizzle immediately. If not, increase the heat.


Cook until the vegetables soften. Depending on the heat, this should take around five minutes. Try spreading the vegetables in a single layer and stirring only once every minute or so to shorten the cooking time.

, Don't add the water yet — you want the dry rice cooking in the oil. Spread the ingredients flat in the pan. Let them cook for up to five minutes, stirring often. When the rice gains a pearly white color, you're ready to proceed.


This technique of cooking the dry rice in the pan is known as ""toasting"" the rice. It is used to give the dish a satisfying nutty flavor and, according to some, reduce cooking time., Stir the ingredients to combine. If your pan isn't big enough to hold the water, transfer your ingredients to a steeper-edged pan.

, Turn the heat to high and let the mixture cook uncovered without stirring. Check on the rice every few minutes to monitor its progress.


Eventually, the surface of the rice will appear dry and steam will billow out of small holes (usually after about eight to ten minutes). This is a sign to proceed.

, Turn the burner to the lowest possible heat. Cover the pan snugly with a lid and cook for 15 more minutes. Don't stir or remove the lid during this time.

, After simmering, remove the pan from the burner and take the lid off. Let it stand for five minutes to cool and finish absorbing the water. Use the back of a fork to ""fluff"" the rice, giving it a little extra volume. Spoon on to serving plates and enjoy.


If the rice still contains a noticeable amount of water, return it to low heat in five minute increments to evaporate the remaining moisture.

Prepare a serving of rice normally.,
Heat vegetable oil on the stove.,
Add beaten egg.,
Stir-fry scallions and curry.,
Add cooked rice.,
Add egg.,
Drizzle with sesame oil and serve.",How to Make Curry Rice2," This recipe calls for plain rice that has already been cooked. To get this, just follow the recipe above, ignoring the vegetables and curry. In other words:


Add two cups of rice and four cups of water to a pot. Bring to a boil.
Cook until the surface of the rice appears dry and steam holes form. Reduce the heat to low.
Cover the pan and let simmer for 15 minutes.
Remove from heat, uncover, and let sit for five minutes before serving.

, Add the oil to a large, sturdy nonstick pan. Warm over medium-high heat for several minutes until shimmering.

, Crack an egg into a small bowl and beat with a fork until the yolk and white are combined. Pour the beaten egg into the hot pan. Swirl the pan to prevent sticking. When the egg solidifies, transfer it to a separate plate and set aside.

, Add the scallions and seasoning together to the pan and stir to combine. You can add an extra dash of oil here to prevent sticking if desired. Season with black pepper to taste. Cook until softened (about five minutes).


If you don't have scallions, substitute a white or yellow onion.

, Stir to mix with the ingredients in the pan. Spread in a single layer and let cook for about three minutes, stirring once.

, Transfer the egg back into the pan. Stir to break up the egg and combine it with the other ingredients. Season with salt to taste.

, Stirring in a small amount of sesame oil in the last minute of cooking gives the rice more of a ""fried"" quality. Add no more than a teaspoon or two over the rice and stir to combine. Let cook for 30 seconds to a minute and remove from heat. Spoon onto serving plates. Serve hot.

Add extra vegetables for a stir fry dish.,
Add paprika for smokey heat.,
Use coconut milk for coconut curry rice.,
Add raisins and almond slivers for Middle Eastern flavor.,
Use red pepper for dry heat.",How to Make Curry Rice3," Curry rice is a versatile dish that lends itself to many recipe variations. For instance, it's not difficult to add plenty of vegetables to make something resembling a stir fry. Simply chop the recipes and add them to the ""Basic"" recipe above with the onions and garlic. Then, proceed with the rest of the recipe as normal. Note that ""hard"" vegetables (carrots, broccoli, etc.) require a little more cooking time, so you may want to add them a few minutes before the onions, garlic, etc.


In the ingredients list above, tomato, eggplant, and okra are recommended because they taste great with curry rice and cook quickly. You can use others, however — don't be afraid to get creative.

, Paprika is an excellent choice for this dish — its smokey, spicy flavor complements the curry naturally. Try adding a teaspoon or two with the curry powder to blend the two seasonings together. Alternatively, use paprika for its rich red color by sprinkling it over the finished rice.

, Coconut milk is a common ingredient in many curries for its smooth, sweet flavor. Try substituting half of the water for coconut milk when you add the liquid to your rice to get a strong coconut flavor. If you want a more subtle flavor or a dish that's less rich, substitute only a quarter of the water for coconut milk., Many rice dishes from the Middle East and Central Asia use almonds and raisins. Cashew halves sometimes substitute for almond slivers. If you're not used to the combination, it can seem a little unusual, but it's delicious to palates that are accustomed to it. To add these flavors to your dish:Add the raisins to the rice mixture right before you add the water and start to boil.
Stir in the almond slivers right before you serve.

, The recipes in this article aren't especially spicy. If you want something with a little more ""kick,"" simply add cayenne or red pepper flakes to taste. Stir these spicy ingredients into the mixture with the curry powder to give the ingredients a satisfying level of heat.


If you accidentally add too much heat, try stirring in a little plain greek yogurt when the dish is finished to neutralize the spiciness. You can also simply dilute the flavor by adding more rice."

Choose a light, carrier oil to use as your base.,
Pour ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of your carrier oil into a glass bottle.,
Add 20 to 30 drops of your favorite essential oil.,
Consider adding 1 teaspoon of rubbing alcohol to help bind the water to the essential oil.,
Close the bottle, and shake it to mix.,
Use the diffuser oil.",How to Make Diffuser Oil1," You can use just about any type of lightweight oil, such as coconut oil, safflower oil, or sweet almond oil. Avoid using solid coconut oil, and other heavy oils, such as extra virgin olive oil and jojoba oil; they will take too long to travel up the diffuser.This method is intended for reed-based diffusers. Do not use it for plug-in diffusers.;
, Stick a funnel into the neck of the bottle first, so that you don't spill and waste any oil.

, Lavender, lemon, mint, tea tree, and vanilla are all popular individual choices, but you can combine different oils to create a more unique fragrance. Here are some combinations to get you started:Bergamot and patchouli
Cinnamon and wild orange
Lavender and eucalyptus
Lavender, lemon, and rosemary
White fir and cypress

, This will also help the oil travel faster up the bamboo reeds.Choose something that is at least 90%.Vodka can be used in place of rubbing alcohol., This will help the different oils (and rubbing alcohol, if you are using it) to blend together instead of just floating on top of each other.

, If your bottle has a narrow neck, you can simply insert some bamboo skewers into it. You can also pour it into your reed diffuser bottle, but make sure that it is clean and all traces of the previous fragrance have been washed out.


When inserting reeds into the bottle, make sure that they are new. Do not reuse old reeds.

Alternatively, vacuum-seal the cornmeal.,
Finished.

",How to Make Cornmeal," You can use nearly any type of corn as long as the kernels have been properly and thoroughly dried.This tutorial covers the process for whole kernel frozen corn.


The easiest option, however, would be to use uncooked popcorn kernels. You won't need to dehydrate popcorn since it's already adequately dry. Use the same amount of popcorn to kernel corn, and skip directly to the ""Grinding"" instructions.
You can also use nearly any variety of home-grown corn if you're feeling more adventurous, but the process can be more time consuming since you'll need to dry it on the stalk. Field or dent corn is the preferred variety for this method, but sweet corn could be used, as well.;
, Electric and hand-operated grain mills are the probably your best options since they'll allow you the greatest degree of control for your effort.


Note that hand-operated grain mills may require considerable strength to use, especially when grinding something as large and coarse as corn.
For small amounts, you could use a mortar and pestle, spice grinder, or coffee grinder.If you don't have an actual grain mill, high-powered blenders (Blendtec, Vitamix, etc.) may also work.Standard blenders are not strong enough, though, so you should avoid using one for this process.

, Open one 16-oz (450-g) bag of frozen corn kernels. Spread the corn over one dehydrator tray, keeping it in an even layer.


You can dry the corn directly from its frozen state. If some of the kernels are fixed together by ice, though, gently tap the chunks of corn on your counter or table to break them apart.

, Place the dehydrator tray into the dehydrator and set the temperature.Since the temperature needs to be so low, it's really best to perform this process using an actual dehydrator rather than an oven. Most ovens will not reach low enough temperatures to dry the corn without cooking it.

, Check the corn kernels after 6 hours pass. Remove it from the dehydrator if it's completely dry; otherwise, continue dehydrating the corn as needed, checking it every 30 to 60 minutes.


To check the status of the corn, take a few kernels and try to manipulate them between your fingers. Properly dried kernels should no longer feel pliable
If the corn doesn't feel pliable anymore, perform a second test by dropping a few kernels on a hard surface, like a counter or table. They should make a distinctive ""click"" sound when ready., If you plan to make the cornmeal immediately, simply transfer the dehydrated corn to a medium mixing bowl and set it aside. Otherwise, place the corn into an airtight plastic bag or container.


Resealable plastic bags work well enough if you plan to make cornmeal within a week or two, but for longer storage, use a canning jar or an airtight plastic container.
You can store the dry corn at in dry, dark, room temperature conditions if you plan to use it within a month. For longer storage, consider keeping it in your refrigerator or freezer.

, Adjust the mill plates/stones to the machine's coarsest setting. Place the dried corn into the hopper, then crank the handle to grind it through the machine.Make sure that you have a bowl or other container beneath the grain mill to collect the processed corn.
When using an electric grain mill, you'll need to switch on the power instead of turning a handle.
The exact method for adjusting the mill plates will vary by machine, so you'll need to consult the instructions for your grain mill to determine the proper procedure. Usually, though, you can adjust the coarseness using a knob on the side of the machine.
Note that you should work in batches of about 2 cups (500 ml), which is the approximate amount used in these instructions. When making larger quantities of cornmeal, work inn multiple batches.

, Dump the coarsely ground corn into a fine-mesh strainer. Gently agitate the strainer from side to side to separate the finely ground pieces from the coarser chunks.Ideally, you should use a mesh strainer with gaps measuring between 1/32 and 1/16 inch (0.8 and 1.5 mm). Larger mesh strainers may pass pieces that are too coarse to be classified as meal.
Collect the small pieces that pass through in a separate bowl placed beneath the strainer. Return the larger pieces caught in the strainer to the hopper of the grain mill.

, Adjust the mill plates again, setting them to a medium-grade coarseness. Grind the large pieces of cracked corn through the mill as before.


It's important to change the coarseness to a finer setting during this step; otherwise, too few of the larger pieces won't be ground down any further.

, Transfer the newly ground corn pieces back to the fine mesh strainer. Rock the strainer from side to side, allowing the finest pieces to pass through into the previous collection bowl for your cornmeal.


You'll likely collect more cornmeal during this sifting than you collected during the first, but in most cases, you'll still be left with a notable amount of coarse grain caught in strainer.

, Adjust the grain mill once more, setting the machine to medium-fine consistency. Return the larger pieces of ground corn to the hopper, then grind them through the machine a third time.


While the machine needs to be set to a finer degree of coarseness, you'll probably need to avoid using the finest setting. Even at cornmeal consistency, ground corn can be too coarse to pass through most mills' finest setting.

, Sift the ground corn through the mesh strainer one more time, collecting the fine meal in your original bowl and retaining the coarser grits.


At this point, you should have more cornmeal than leftover grits, and the amount of cornmeal should roughly match the original amount of dried corn you began with.
If you're still not satisfied with the amount of cornmeal produced, however, you can pass through the coarse grits through your grain mill one more time. Afterward, sift them again using the mesh strainer. The amount of cornmeal produced by a fourth pass will likely be less than the amount produced by the previous two passes. Moreover, beyond a fourth pass, additional passes through the grain mill may become even less beneficial.
If you're okay with the amount of leftover grits, however, consider saving them and preparing them as you would prepare store-bought grits.

, You can use the cornmeal immediately after you make it. In fact, using it the same or next day will allow you to retain the maximum amount of nutrients and flavor.


Use homemade cornmeal in any recipe calling for cornmeal, including cornbread, cornmeal mush, and cornmeal-based fish batter.

, Cornmeal you don't plan to use immediately can be transferred into freezer-safe containers and stored in your freezer.


Pack the cornmeal into an appropriate jar or other container, leaving about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace. Close the jar and place it into your freezer, storing it there for as long as 9 to 12 months.
You can usually use the cornmeal directly from the freezer without thawing it, but for temperature-sensitive recipes, thaw it at room temperature for 30 to 60 minutes before use.

, This is another way to save leftover cornmeal that should prevent it from turning rancid.


The best way to vacuum-seal cornmeal is with the use of an actual vacuum-sealing machine and the appropriate bags or storage containers. Exact instructions will vary by machine.
If you do not have the actual machine, however, you can mimic the process using standard plastic bags.

Place the cornmeal in a heavy-duty resealable plastic bag. Press out as much air as possible, then seal the bag, leaving only 1 inch (2.5 cm) of open space along the seal.
Suck out as much of the remaining air through a straw inserted into the opening. Do this step carefully to avoid accidentally inhaling bits of cornmeal.
When finished, quickly remove the straw and seal the remainder of the opening.


Vacuum-sealed bags of cornmeal can be stored in dark, dry, slightly cool conditions for up to 9 or 12 months.

Plug the diffuser into the wall.",How to Make Diffuser Oil2," This method is intended for those small diffusers that you plug into your wall. They are about the same size as nightlights and have a small glass jar or bulb attached to the bottom.

, In most cases, you will need to twist the bulb counterclockwise.

, This will help pop the cap out.


Some wicks may have a nail inserted through them. In this case, you may need to use a pair of needle-nose pliers to pry it out., Be aware that some wicks have a sharp nail poked through them., You can even combine different oils to create your own unique scent.


Some of the oil scent will remain. When adding a new scent, consider using something that is similar to the old one.This will ensure that you don't end up with something that smells unpleasant.

, You need that extra space for the wick. If you are using a bulb-shaped diffuser, then fill it to just below the widest point., If you took the wick out of the cap, then put it back in first. Try to pop the cap straight down, applying even pressure. Wiggling it back and forth will not be as effective., This will blend the oil and water together. Don't worry if your mixture looks cloudy; this is normal, because you are using essential oils.

, The fragrance will be more subtle than the store bought fragrance because you are using natural, essential oils. It will take only a fraction of the cost to make, however!

, Pour the olive oil into the uncovered pressure cooker and set it on your stove over medium heat for 30 to 60 seconds.


Gently turn the pressure cooker to evenly coat the bottom in oil.
Note that you'll initially use the pressure cooker as a standard saucepan. Leave the lid off until you need to use the pressure feature.

, Add the onion and and green pepper to the hot oil. Cook, stirring frequently, for 2 to 4 minutes.


Allow the onion to become aromatic and slightly translucent. The green pepper should also soften but will only be tender-crisp at this point.

, Add the raw liver, sausage, and celery to the pressure cooker. Cooking, stirring infrequently, until the the meats are nearly done.


Crumble the sausage before adding it.
When ready, most of the liver should be pink ad most of the sausage should be lightly browned. This can take anywhere from 3 to 6 minutes.

, Sprinkle the contents of the pressure cooker with the paprika, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, oregano, thyme, and parsley. Add the rice, then mix everything together.


Note that 2 tsp (10 ml) of Creole seasoning can be used instead of the individual seasonings.

As you stir, carefully scrape the bottom of the pressure cooker to remove any burnt, stuck debris sitting at the bottom.

, Cover the pressure cooker and lock the lid in place. Turn the heat up to high and watch the pressure gauge. Once it reaches full pressure, reduce the heat and cook for 4 minutes at high pressure.Each pressure cooker model varies, so you'll need to check the manufacturer's instructions to determine how low you can reduce the heat while still maintaining full pressure. Reduce the heat to this minimum setting.

, After 4 minutes pass, move the pressure cooker off the burner and wait until the pressure drops on its own before unlocking and removing the lid.


Note that you'll usually need to wait roughly 10 minutes for the pressure to release.
If you're using an electric pressure cooker, unplug the device and wait approximately 10 minutes before releasing the rest of the pressure using the valve.

, Fluff the rice and enjoy the dish while it's still hot.

Prepare the food you want to fry.,
Mix the batter ingredients in a bowl.,
Heat enough oil to submerge the food.,
Dip the food pieces into the batter.,
Fry until golden brown.",How to Make Batter1," All-purpose batter tastes great with pretty much any meat or vegetable you'd want to fry. No matter what you're frying, cut the food into similar-sized pieces so each piece will fry evenly. Try any of the following foods:Sliced onions, jalapeños or other vegetables
Boneless chicken breasts (cut into strips or nuggets) or bone-in chicken pieces
Fish such as cod, tilapia or haddock;
, Add all the ingredients to a bowl and use a whisk to mix them until smooth. This basic batter mix is delicious on its own. If you'd like, customize it by adding a pinch or two of any of the following spices:









Old Bay seasoning
Cayenne pepper
Garlic powder
Italian seasoning

, Use a deep, heavy-bottomed pot that will heat the oil evenly. In most cases you'll need an inch or two of oil to submerge the food you're frying. Place it over medium-high heat and allow it to heat for several minutes. To test whether it's ready, use a fry thermometer to take the temperature of the oil. Once it reaches 350°F (176°C), it's ready to fry.


Choose a high smoke-point oil. Peanut, canola, vegetable and grapeseed oils are all suitable for frying. You want to use an oil that can be heated to a high temperature without smoking.
If you don't have a fry thermometer, don't use a meat thermometer. Instead, test the oil by placing a small piece of food in the pot. If it immediately starts to sizzle and turn brown, the oil is ready.
Cooking food before the oil is ready will result in the batter sliding off. The food will turn out greasy and wet instead of moist on the inside and crispy on the outside.

, Use a fork to dip a piece of food into the batter to coat it on all sides. Try to get an even coating of batter. Shake off the excess drips.








, Place enough pieces of battered food into the pot to evenly cover the bottom of the pot. Avoid overlapping food, since this will result in uneven cooking. Fry until the food is golden brown on both sides, then place it on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Cooking times will vary depending on what you're frying.









Vegetables typically need no more than three or four minutes in the pot. Smaller pieces will require less time.
Raw chicken or fish may require five to fifteen minutes' frying time, depending on how big your pieces are and whether they have bones. The center of the meat should be opaque when it is fully cooked.
If the oil seems to be browning and burning the outside of the food before the inside is cooked, turn down the temperature. You want to try to keep it at a steady 350°F (176°C).

Prepare the food you want to fry.,
Mix the batter.,
Heat enough oil to submerge the food.,
Dip the the food in flour before battering.,
Fry until golden brown.",How to Make Batter2," Beer batter comes out crispy and smooth. It's the perfect coating for fish, onion rings and other vegetables. Make sure all food pieces that you want to fry are cut into similar-sized pieces, so they'll fry evenly., With so few ingredients, beer batter is easy to make. Just mix the flour, spices, and one 12-ounce beer in a bowl. Use a whisk to mix the ingredients until smooth.








, Use a deep, heavy-bottomed pot that will heat the oil evenly. Fill the pot with an inch or two of oil to submerge the food you're frying. Place it over medium-high heat and allow it to heat for several minutes. To test whether it's ready, use a fry thermometer to take the temperature of the oil. Once it reaches 350°F (176°C), it's ready to fry.


Choose a high smoke-point oil. Peanut oil is traditionally used along with beer batter for a distinctive taste.
If you don't have a fry thermometer, test the oil by placing a small piece of battered food in the pot. If it immediately starts to sizzle and turn brown, the oil is ready.

, Dipping the food in flour first will help this rather liquidy batter stick to the food instead of sliding off. Coat the food with flour on all sides. Tap it on the edge of the bowl to remove excess flour. Use a fork to dip the food pieces in batter to coat on all sides. Shake off the excess batter before frying.









Having a lot of extra batter in the pan can cause the temperature in the pot to drop, making the food pieces cook unevenly. That's why it's important to shake off excess batter.

, Place the pieces of fish, onion, etc. into the pot. Line the bottom of the pot, and make sure none of the food overlaps. Cook the food until it's golden brown on both sides.









Fish pieces generally need about five minutes in the pot. When the fish has turned golden brown, cut into a piece to make sure it's opaque in the middle.
If the oil seems to be browning and burning the outside of the food before the inside is cooked, turn down the temperature. You want to try to keep it at a steady 350°F (176°C).

Fry until golden brown.",How to Make Batter3," Tempura batter is a thin, crispy Japanese-style batter that is traditionally used with bite-sized pieces of meat, seafood, and vegetables. Cut the food into similar-sized pieces so that it cooks evenly. These foods work well with tempura batter:Shrimp
Crab pieces
Cubed chicken, pork or steak
Broccoli florets
Slices of sweet potato

, This batter should come out very thin and runny. Mix the ingredients together and use a whisk to make sure there are no lumps.








, Pour a few inches of vegetable or peanut oil into a heavy-bottomed pot. Add a few tablespoons of sesame oil for flavor if desired. Heat the oil until it reaches 350°F (176°C).


Special tempura fryers are available for keeping the oil at a steady temperature throughout the frying process.
If you don't have a fry thermometer, test the oil by dropping a battered piece of food into the pot. If it turns golden brown, the oil is ready to fry.

, When cooking tempura, food pieces are normally skewered on wooden or metal skewers. Skewer a piece of food, then dip it into the batter to completely coat it. You may want to skewer more than one piece on the same skewer.








, Dip the skewer into the pot so that the food pieces are submerged in oil. Hold them there for several minutes, until they are golden brown on all sides.









Since meat will require a longer frying time than vegetables, fry the meat in a separate batch.
Small pieces of meat and vegetables should need no more than five minutes' cooking time. Cut into a piece to make sure it is done in the center before eating.

Rinse the rice in cold water.,
Bring the water to a boil.,
Add the rice and salt to the pot.,
Cover the pot and cook until the rice is tender.,
Allow the rice to sit in the pot for several minutes.,
Fluff the rice with a fork and serve.",How to Make Boiled Rice1," Before boiling white rice, it’s a good idea to rinse it. That removes any dusty starch that might be on the rice so it doesn’t stick together when it cooks. Place 1 cup (195 g) medium- or long-grain white rice in a strainer, and rinse it under cold running water.Rinsing the rice isn’t always necessary. Some rice may have more starch on it than others, though, so you may just want to get in the habit of doing it with every batch that you boil.;
, Add 2 cups (470 ml) of water to a small saucepan, and place it on the stove at medium-high to high heat. Allow the water to heat until it comes to a roiling boil.When you’re making white rice, use a use a 1:2 ratio for the rice and water. That means for every 1 cup of rice you plan to make, use 2 cups of water.
As it cooks, rice expands so it’s important to use a pan that’s large enough for the amount that you’re making. In general, a 2-quart (2.5 L) pan is large enough for 1 to 2 cups of uncooked rice.

, Once the water comes to a boil, add the rice and ½ teaspoon of (2.84 g) salt and stir gently. Allow the pot to come to a gentle simmer.You can also add 1 tablespoon (14 g) of butter or oil to flavor the rice and keep it from sticking together as it cooks.

, After the pot reaches a simmer, turn the burner’s heat down to low, and cover the pot with its lid. Allow the rice to cook for approximately 18 minutes. At that point, start checking its texture. When the rice is finished, it will be firm but not crunchy. You want it to be tender, so it’s okay if it’s somewhat sticky. However, make sure that you don’t cook it so long that it becomes gummy.Don’t take the lid off the pot before the 18 minute mark. It helps trap steam that aids in the cooking process, so if you remove the lid, it may take longer for the rice to finish.
If you don’t have a lid for your pot, use foil to cover it while the rice cooks. Just make sure to cinch the foil around the edges so the steam can’t escape.
If there’s still water left in the pot when the rice is finished cooking, you should drain it. Just tilt it over the sink to allow the excess water to drip out.

, Once the rice is finished cooking, turn off the heat but leave the rice in the pot with the lid on. Let it sit and steam for another 5 minutes to finish off the cooking process., Just before you’re ready to serve, take the lid off the pot and use a fork or spoon to comb through the rice and fluff it. Transfer the rice to a bowl or individual plates and serve.It’s a good idea to allow the rice to sit for another 2 to 3 minutes after fluffing before you serve it. That gives it some time to dry out so it’s not too wet and sticky when you serve it.

Mix the dry ingredients.,
Cut the fat into the dry ingredients.,
Alternatively, use a pastry blender.",How to Make a Substitute for Bisquick1," In a large bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together. Use a whisk or a large spoon to get a nice even mixture.


All-purpose flour works best here. However, alternatives are possible. For example, to make gluten-free pancakes, substitute buckwheat or almond flour.;
, Shortening, oil, and other fats are sometimes tricky to mix evenly into dry ingredients like flour. Using a technique called ""cutting"" can help. To cut the fat in, put or pour it onto the dry ingredients, then use two knives to distribute it in a ""criss-crossing"" motion. Continue until it is well-combined and the mixture naturally forms blueberry-sized clumps.If using melted butter, disperse the butter as evenly as possible before mixing. It's a little harder to get butter to mix evenly than it is when using the other ingredients.

, If you want a mix that's guaranteed to be even or you're having trouble cutting in solid fat like shortening, consider using a pastry blender. Some recipes even call for for this handy kitchen tool specifically.Simply the pulsing the ingredients together a few times until they're well-combined should be enough to achieve the desired consistency. If it has a ""cut"" setting, use this. If not, any general ""combine"" setting should be fine.

Fluff the rice and serve.",How to Make Boiled Rice2," Just as with white rice, it helps to give brown rice a rinse before boiling it. That helps remove any dust and grit that may be clinging to it. Place 1 cup (190 g) medium- or long-grain brown rice in a strainer or colander and rinse it under cool water.Rinsing the rice before cooking can also improve its texture, so each grain is distinct and doesn’t stick to the others.

, To bring out the nutty flavor of brown rice, you should toast it before boiling it. Place a 2-quart (2.5 L) pan on the stove, and heat 1 teaspoon (5 ml) olive oil or sesame oil in it over medium-high heat. Add the rice to the pan, and toast it until the rice is completely dry and the ends begin to look lightly toasted.You can also tell when the rice is finished toasting when it begins to give off a nutty aroma.

, After the rice has finished toasting, pour 2 cups (470 ml) of water into the pan, and mix in 1 teaspoon (5.68 g) of salt. The water will steam and bubble when you first add it because the pan is hot due to the toasting., Leave the pot on the burner at medium-high to high heat, and bring the rice, water, and salt mixture to a complete boil. After the pot comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and allow it to reduce to a bare simmer before covering it with a lid.Make sure not to cover the pot until the contents stop boiling completely.

, After you’ve covered the pot, allow it to cook on low heat for 45 minutes. At the end of the cooking time, uncover the pot and look to see if the rice has absorbed all of the water. Test the rice to see if it’s no longer crunchy too. It should be tender but slightly chewy when it’s done.During the 45 minute cooking period, don’t uncover the pot. That will cause steam to escape, and the rice will need longer to cook.
It’s okay if there’s a little water at the bottom of the pot when you check it after 45 minutes. If there’s more than 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of water, though, drain the excess into the sink.
If the rice is still crunchy after 45 minutes, pour a bit more water if necessary into the pot and allow the rice to cook longer. Be sure to check on it in 10 minute intervals, though, until the rice is tender.

, When the rice is finished, remove it from the heat, and place the lid on the pot once again. Allow it to sit for approximately 10 to 15 minutes in the covered pot to get rid of some of its stickiness.Allowing the rice to sit also helps it dry a little so it doesn’t seem as wet and freshly steamed when you serve it.

, Remove the lid from pot, and use a fork or spoon to rake through the rice and fluff it. Place it in a bowl or on individual plates to serve.Leftover brown rice can last between 3 and 5 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator.

Place 2 cups (380 g) basmati rice in a strainer, and rinse it under cold, running water to remove any dust or debris. Next, transfer the rice to a large bowl full of cold water and soak it for 30 minutes to an hour before draining it well.Soaking the rice isn’t entirely necessary, but it helps make the rice softer once it’s cooked.

, Transfer the rice to a heavy sauce pot that has a lid. Add a pinch of salt, and then pour 3 cups (705 ml) boiling water over the rice.If you don’t have a lid for your pot, don’t worry. You can set a cookie sheet that’s large enough to cover it on top when the times comes.
You can add as much salt as you like to taste. In most cases, ⅛ teaspoon (0.7 g) for each cup of rice is usually sufficient.

, Set the pot on a burner and turn the heat to medium-high. Allow the rice and water to come to a simmer, and just before it starts boiling and steaming once more, place a sheet of foil over the pot, pressing it all along the edges to keep the steam from escaping.

It should keep well in the same places that Bisquick itself does: closets, pantries, etc. Stored correctly, this mix should last at least a few weeks.

, Stored in the fridge, Bisquick substitute can last up to four months. If you're making it way ahead of time, put it in an airtight container in the fridge to keep it fresh.


If you're using your Bisquick substitute fairly quickly, you shouldn't need to worry about storing the mix in the fridge unless you used butter as the fat in your mix. Butter can eventually go rancid at room temperature, so it's wise in this case to keep your mix in the fridge.

, Do you want to use fresh basil in your dishes? If so, follow the steps as listed below:


Put lots of fresh basil into a glass.






Next, put water on the stems until they are covered. It will remain fresh for weeks, just sitting on the kitchen counter! In fact, if you periodically freshen the water, the herb may even sprout roots.






Trim your basil plants once in a while to promote more growth, and enjoy your fresh basil for quite a long time.







, Your spices should be stored in any area that is dark and cool. Storing spices in lighted areas or warm areas can reduce their length of freshness. Try to find a cool, dark cupboard if you want to increase the flavor and lifespan of your favorite spices. If you use fresh spices, your food will taste better.

, Sticking a citrus fruit in the microwave can help when you're trying to juice it. Follow the steps below to achieve this excellent method:


Put the fruit inside the microwave and heat it for about ten seconds, depending on size.






Immediately after removing the fruit from the microwave, gently roll it on a flat surface. Now you are ready to begin juicing.







, Meals that are full of color are healthy and visually stunning. Some colorful garnishes you can add to your meals include cherry tomatoes, cilantro, parsley and carrot curls. Do a little experimentation with different foods and colors to produce dishes that are both awe inspiring and appetizing.

, Tomatoes and other juicy ingredients should be on the bottom layer and lettuce along with any other ingredients which might wilt or get soggy should be on the top.

, Metal skewers will work better if they are twisted or squared.

, One of the ways is to warm an oven up to 350 °F (177 °C), and then place the tortilla right on the oven rack until it reaches the crispness you desire.


You can also crisp your tortilla on the gas burner of your stove-top. Just turn the flame on low and place the tortilla on the burner above the flame. Watch it carefully! It only takes a moment! A hot, fresh, crunchy tortilla is within reach when these simple techniques are used.







, Hard utensils like wood or metal can scratch your cookware and the coatings on them that provide that non stick surface. This doesn't taste great, and can also be dangerous.

, Make meals that will relax you and that you can enjoy and your family will appreciate them as well. Learning to cook can help you to improve your diet, and it can also enhance your quality of life. The kitchen should be the centerpiece of your home.

Make time for your meals.",How to Learn Cooking by Yourself," Cooking utensils range from high-end, fancy cookware, to simple items, such as wooden spoons. To start, you do not need to go all-out and purchase hundreds of dollars’ worth of items. Instead, get the basics, such as a whisk, stirring spoons, a metal spatula, and a scraping spatula., A quick walk down a grocery store aisle will reveal a plethora of pots, pans, and gadgets designed to make cooking easier. Ignore all of this, and start with the basics, including a stock pot, a saucepan, and a griddle. These three items will take care of most of your cooking needs.You can change these basics to suit your needs. If you plan to make small amounts of food, for instance, you can probably get by with a single pan that has high walls, rather than a separate stock pot.

, Recipes require precise measurements, so measuring cups and utensils are an absolute must. You only need one of each, as you can wash as you cook, but make sure you have a full set of cup measurements (¼-1), as well as a full set of measuring spoons. For ease, you should also get a glass measuring bowl that goes up to at least two cups.


Some recipes require cooking utensils to be aluminum-free. When choosing measuring cups and spoons, opt for ones made of either a high-quality plastic or stainless steel.

, Low-quality or dull knives can make cooking a chore. Before you begin cooking, make sure you have at least one good-quality, sharp paring knife with which to complete your recipes. Sharp knives will mean the difference between diced tomatoes, and a smashed, pulpy mess.

, Secure at least one cookbook that covers the basics. Purchase one designed for beginners, as these will not only provide you with an array of simple, effective recipes, but will also give you an introduction into cooking terminology and supplies.Purchase a cookbook geared toward beginners and the types of dishes you’d like to learn. A good choice might be “Italian Cooking for Beginners,” if you’d like to focus on pasta dishes or sauces.
Read reviews before purchasing a beginner’s cookbook to make sure it is right for you.
If you don’t have access to a cookbook, you can use phone apps such as Epicurious and Cooking to truly master your cooking craft.

, Although cooking doesn’t not have to involve biohazard suits and meticulously-applied gloves, there are some safety rules that must be followed. Never allow raw meats to touch other foods, for instance, and always clean your cooking surfaces after you’ve cooked to prevent bacteria growth and cross-contamination.Prepare your meat separately from any other food items. This means using a different knife, a different cutting board, and even a different countertop or surface.
Although vegetables and fruits do not pose as high a risk, you should still sanitize surfaces that have come into contact with them. The presence of food particles indicates the possible presence of unwanted mold and bacteria.

, Although it may be tempting to make alterations or substitutions as you cook, follow all of your recipes exactly as written. When cooking, there are many chemical reactions and flavor interactions that go into making a dish excellent. Until you fully understand how these chemical processes work, and feel comfortable mixing your own flavors, adhere to the recipe.Later in your cooking career, you can improvise and add to (or detract from) dishes, but you must master the basics first both to refine our tasting palate and to develop an instinct for cooking.

, Breakfast dishes are often some of the simplest ones, and the recipes hardest to mess up on. You can start with making different types of eggs, for instance, move on to basic pancake and waffle recipes, and gradually move up to baking and more complicated recipes.Making your own breakfast will also help you develop the habit of eating breakfast each day, which is proven to help in weight management and staying alert throughout the day.

, As you learn to master the basics, begin to add some flair to simple dishes, such as sandwiches or steamed vegetables. A grilled cheese, for instance, lends itself to experimentation with different cheeses, fruits and vegetables, and types of bread. To build confidence, practice making simple, easy dishes more decadent and unique.


Although you don’t want to become too reliant upon shortcuts, simple shortcuts such as using pre-made pesto, or pre-made salsa can keep you from becoming too stressed or overwhelmed to continue learning to cook at home.
When you find something you like, you can look up a recipe and practice making it yourself without pressure.

, Soups and stews are an excellent next step as you build your cooking repertoire, as they are also difficult to go wrong--provided that the recipes are simple and straightforward. Start with something simple, like vegetable broth, and gradually work your way up to harder soups and stews, such as broccoli and cheese soup.Soups and stews are both excellent for days when you don’t have a lot of time to cook. You can place all of your items into a large crock pot, turn it on low, and let it sit overnight or throughout the day, and return to a ready-made dinner in the evening.

, Once you are comfortable with simple soup and stew recipes, you can move on to making casseroles. While casseroles are more complicated than soups, breakfast foods, and items like sandwiches, they can still be quite forgiving due to the nature of their appearance (all mixed together), and the bounty of flavors most casseroles provide.

, To effectively learn to cook, you must do so often. Make a commitment to completing at least two meals per day at home when you are starting out to get your “sea legs,” so to speak, and build confidence.Avoid complicated recipes that call for 2-3 hours of prep. Instead, shoot for recipes with only 30 minutes of prep time to keep your interest level high and your cravings low.

, When you are starting out, you will most likely need some routine and simplicity in place. To streamline your cooking, make a meal plan for each day of the week, and set aside or mark each recipe you choose. That way, cooking is not a chore.Meal planning helps you feel some confidence and strength in your cooking, and it also makes grocery shopping a lot easier each week.

, When you are just beginning, every dish is a new dish. As you begin to grow comfortable with the food items you’ve mastered, incorporate one new meal each week to keep your meals fresh and interesting, and to keep building your skill.Again, the key is to practice, not to make extravagant dishes. Your new dish can be as simple as graduating from a frittata to a quiche, as long as you are incorporating a new skill.

, Start small, by hosting a brunch or similarly low-key event. Inviting family and friends to try your dishes will give you confidence, and will force you to truly focus in and hone your craft to avoid embarrassment or unsafe cooking practices. When cooking for family and friends, choose a recipe (or recipes) you have truly mastered and feel confident in.

, As you work on practicing your craft, prep your meals ahead of time. One of the biggest pitfalls in home-cooked food is the prep time. Between cutting vegetables, creating stock, and fluffing rice, you can quickly run out of time to make your meal.Chop your veggies in advance, make a stockpile of chicken (or beef or vegetable) stock, and make a large batch of grains to eat throughout the week.

, Once you’ve cooked your meals, make a nice ritual of eating. Create a ritual surrounding all of your meals, and make them special. This will encourage you to continue cooking, and will make not only the process of cooking fun, but also the process of eating and savoring.For breakfast, open the blinds, turn on some music or a podcast, and prepare a cup of coffee or tea.
For lunch, you might set your plate next to a cloth napkin, and sit down to eat and ruminate.
For dinner, you could light a candle and eat in dim lighting.

Review the recipe.,
Split the amount of each ingredient in half.,
Work with seasonings carefully.,
Note any substitutions you may need.,
Rewrite the recipe for your own convenience.,
Divide an egg.,
Ground up whole spices.,
Measure out packets.,
When in doubt, measure out.,
Change the pan size.While this is not always essential, you often need to prepare a halved dish in a pan that is half the size of the pan originally called for in the recipe.,
Consider the cooking temperature.,
Alter the cooking time as needed.,
Know the exceptions.",How to Half a Recipe," As with any recipe, the first thing you should do is to read the ingredient list and the instructions completely and carefully. By doing this, you will know which ingredients need to be cut in half precisely and which ingredients are less particular. You will also learn when each ingredient will be used and if any need to be divided further during the preparation.;
, Go through the list of ingredients and cut each required amount in half. Use half the number of whole ingredients, and for the rest of the ingredients, split the measurements in half.


For whole ingredients, simply split the amount of whole ingredients used in half. For instance, a recipe that originally calls for two apples should only use one when halved. A recipe that only calls for one apple originally should only use half an apple when halved.
If an ingredient is measured out in weight, cut the weight in half. For example, if the original recipe calls for 1 lb (450 g) of ground beef, only use 1/2 lb (225 g) of ground beef for the halved recipe.
When halving measurements, use the following guide:2 Tbsp (30 ml) instead of 1/4 cup (60 ml)
2 Tbsp and 2 tsp (40 ml) instead of 1/3 cup (80 ml)
1/4 cup (60 ml) instead of 1/2 cup (125 ml)
1/3 cup (80 ml) instead of 2/3 cup (160 ml)
6 Tbsp (90 ml) instead of 3/4 cup (185 ml)
1 and 1/2 tsp (7.5 ml) instead of 1 Tbsp (15 ml)
1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) instead of 1 tsp (5 ml)
1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) instead of 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml)
1/8 tsp (0.625 ml) instead of 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml)
1 dash instead of 1/8 tsp (0.625 ml)



, Scale down on the side of caution when halving the number of seasonings. Instead of using exactly half, you might want to consider using just shy of half the amount, especially if the seasonings are easier to adjust later on. It is typically better to need more seasoning than it is to have too much.

, If you do not have a specific ingredient on the list or do not want to use one for whatever reason, you will need to substitute that ingredient for something with similar properties. Determine how much of this other ingredient you would need to match the full amount of the original ingredient. Afterward, cut the full amount of the substitute in half.

, You will probably find it easier to write the recipe out, including both the ingredient list and the instructions. It will be easier to refer to a corrected version of the recipe as you make it rather than trying to remember which corrections you made while looking at the original version.


When rewriting the recipe, you need to pay special attention to any measurements mentioned within the instructions. For instance, an original recipe might require 2 tsp (10 ml) of salt, and half of that salt might need to be used at the beginning while the other half is used at the end. As such, one part of the instructions might read, “Use 1 tsp (5 ml) of salt,” and a later part might say, “Use the remaining salt.” When rewriting the first statement, make sure that you rewrite it to reflect half the original amount, or, “Use 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of salt.”
Also make any necessary alterations to cooking time or pan size as you rewrite the recipe. See the section of this article called “Additional Considerations” for more information.

, Eggs are one of the most notoriously intimidating ingredients to divide in half for a recipe, but if you need to divide an odd number of eggs, you could do so without much problem. Crack the full amount into a measuring cup and beat it lightly, just until the yolk and white are combined. Then, measure out half to use for your recipe.When measuring out half an egg from the full amount, first measure the number of tablespoons (milliliters) the full whisked egg equals. After you do this, measure out half the original amount and add that to your recipe.
A typical large egg will equal about 3 Tbsp (45 ml) of whisked egg, so you can keep this in mind if you do not want to break more eggs than necessary and want to calculate an estimated amount ahead of time.
Alternatively, you can use an egg substitute or carton of ""beaten"" eggs instead of whole eggs. Follow the instructions on the carton to determine how much you would measure out for a full egg and how much to measure out for half an egg.

, If a recipe calls for a whole spice berry or other whole spice that is difficult to divide, you will need to grind up the full amount of spices using a mortar and pestle. After this is done, measure the full amount and cut that in half. Use the halved amount for your halved recipe.


If you know how much powdered spice equals a particular whole spice, you can just buy and use the powdered form from the start instead of crushing the whole spice by hand. You might need to research this information online or in a cook book, but a few common examples include:1 star anise equal 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) ground anise; use 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) for half
3 inches (7.6 cm) of cinnamon stick equal 1 tsp (5 ml) ground cinnamon; use 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) for half
3 whole cloves equal 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of ground cloves; use 1/8 tsp (0.625 ml) for half
1 garlic clove equals 1/8 tsp (0.625 ml) ground garlic; use a dash for half
1 inch (2.5 cm) of vanilla bean equals 1 tsp (5 ml) of vanilla extract; use 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) for half



, If you are asked to use a full packet of a certain ingredient in the original recipe, you will need to measure out how much is originally in one packet. Once you have this information, you can measure out half of the original amount and add it to your recipe.


Some packets will list the amount inside. If the packet does not, however, you should measure out the full amount yourself.
Do not try to gauge what “half” the packet is by eye, especially if you are working with sensitive ingredients, like yeast.
As an example, a standard 0.25-oz (7.5 g) package of active dry yeast contains 2 1/4 tsp (11.25 ml).If you need to use half a package, use 1.125 tsp or 1 tsp and a pinch (5.625 ml) of yeast.

, Essentially, any ingredient you run across that is difficult to cut in half as is must be reduced to a form that can be measured using measuring spoons, measuring cups, or scales. Measure that ingredient in full and cut the full measurement in half for your recipe.

,


As a general rule, you should reduce the pan size so that the ingredients measure out to the same depth called for in the original recipe. In other words, if you need to fill a large baking dish halfway deep with cake batter, choose a smaller baking dish that you can fill to the halfway point with your halved cake batter.
Note that this matters more if if you have a recipe that will fill up an entire dish. If you have a recipe that produces whole portions, you can use just about any size pan. For instance, if you are baking 12 cookies when the original recipe called for 24, you can still use the same size baking sheet. There will be extra room, but this extra room will not affect the way that the cookies bake.

, The cooking temperature almost always remains the same for a recipe, even if you halve it. In fact, you should treat the cooking temperature as a constant and use it as a way to monitor the progress of the dish as it cooks.


You also need to check the internal temperature of the food if the recipe lists that information. Like the cooking temperature, the internal temperature does not need to be halved and should remain the same for a halved recipe.
The only time you should consider raising the temperature is if you are cooking more than one dish in the oven at the same time. In this case, raise the temperature by 25 degrees Fahrenheit (14 degrees Celsius).

, If you are baking half a recipe in a dish that is half its original size, you might need to reduce the cooking time, as well. Note that this cooking time is not usually reduced exactly in half, though. You should start monitoring the food at the halfway point, but it may take longer to actually finish cooking.


For half a recipe of cake, bread, or pie, the cooking time will be between two-thirds and three-quarters of the original cooking time.
For half a recipe involving meat or vegetables, the cooking time will usually be about half. The exception, however, is if you use individual cuts of meat that measure the same size as the cuts called for in your original recipe. In other words, a 2 lb (900 g) roast will cook in half the time it takes a 4 lb (1800 g) roast to cook, but two 1/4 lb (115 g) hamburgers will cook in the same amount of time it takes for four 1/4 lb (115 g) hamburgers to cook through.

, While most recipes can be halved, there are a few that are more difficult than others. If a recipe might not take well to being halved, you should ask yourself if you want to risk it anyway or if it would be better to find a better recipe for a similar dish that yields fewer servings.


Delicate foods like soufflés and baked items with yeast tend to be difficult to halve since the food chemistry does not always produce the desired results. You can attempt to do so and may have some success, but you always face the risk that the recipe will not turn out exactly right.

Choose your greasing agent.,
Choose your flour.,
Grease the pan.,
Add the flour.,
Add the batter.",How to Grease and Flour a Pan,"









Butter and shortening are the 2 most common fats used to grease baking pans. Butter will impart a slight richness to the batter and will help the exterior bake to a golden brown. Shortening is flavorless and the batter is less likely to brown. Oil based sprays and vegetable oil should not be used to grease the pan. When heated, the oil polymerizes and the result is a hard glaze that is difficult to remove without harming the surface of the pan.;
,









Various flours can be used to flour the pan, but the rule of thumb is to use the flour that the recipe called for. This way you won't be altering the taste or composition of the batter. If it is a chocolate cake made with cocoa powder, you can use cocoa powder in the place of the flour so that the cake retains a rich, dark exterior with no white flour residue.

,









Cut a square of wax paper large enough to hold 1 tbsp. (15 ml) of butter or shortening. Hold the butter so that the wax paper is between the butter and your fingers. Spread the fat over the interior of the pan being careful to cover the entire interior. You don't have to apply a thick coat. Continue until each baking pan that you'll be using is greased.

,









Add 1 or 2 tbsp. (15 to 30 ml) of flour or cocoa powder to the greased pan. Pick the pan up and tilt it about, allowing the flour to distribute and cover the entire interior of the pan. The flour will stick to any greased surface. Invert the pan over the garbage or a sink and tap it gently with your hand to remove any excess flour. Continue in this fashion until each required pan is floured.

, Your cake pans are now greased and floured and are ready for the batter.

Use a manual juicer.,
Buy an electric citrus juicer for large quantities.,
Pick juicy lemons.,
Store lemons in the freezer.,
Microwave the lemons before cutting.",How to Juice a Lemon," Cut the lemon in half, from tip to tip. This makes a more flexible lemon peel, easier to squeeze.








If you have a hinge-style hand juicer, cut them crosswise instead for a better fit.;
, The mesh will catch the lemon seeds and pulp, letting the juice drain through.

, Place a lemon half between the two arms of your kitchen tongs, near the prongs, and squeeze.This is fast, easy, and doesn't fill your kitchen drawer with a one-purpose tool.








, This alternative requires even less specialized equipment. Hold the lemon half firmly with one hand, angling the lemon downward to avoid a squirt of juice in your face. Stick a fork or spoon in the pulp and rotate it around the lemon. Repeat until very little pulp remains.









A fork will let you scrape out the last bits of pulp, getting more juice from each lemon. But if you're juicing a whole pile of lemons, pick the spoon for a faster job.
If you only want a few drops of lemon juice to flavor a dish, just stick the fork in a whole lemon and squeeze. The rest of the lemon will stay good for much longer than a cut half., These cheap tools speed up the job a little, and are a bit less messy. Find one made from wood, plastic, or enameled aluminum, since bare metal will gradually corrode if exposed to citric acid. They come in three varieties:









A hand juicer sits over your bowl, with a ridged knob sticking up. Press the lemon half down and rotate several times around the knob. Squeeze to the edge of the skin to get all the juice.
A reamer has an identical knob, attached to a handle instead. Hold the lemon half in one hand and rotate the reamer around the lemon.
A hinged squeezer is the fastest, but only when juicing lemons that fit nicely into your model. Cut off the knobby tip if present, then place your lemon half face-down in the cup. Hold over the bowl and press the other arm hard against the lemon, turning it inside out., An all-purpose juicer will put a great deal of bitter pith in your juice, and its metal blades may corrode over time. Buy a specialized citrus juicer for better results.









If using an all-purpose juicer, peel the lemon first or wash it thoroughly to remove trace pesticides.
Many experts agree that hand-squeezed juice tastes better, possibly because an electric machine scrapes away too much pith, or fails to break out flavorful oils from the peel., Smaller lemons have a higher percentage of juice, so select these if buying lemons by weight or juicing a large number. Avoid rough-skinned lemons, which may have shriveled and lost juice as they aged.When shopping, heft two similarly-sized lemons, one in each hand. The heavier one has more juice.
Meyer is the most common extra-juicy variety, but some areas will stock Fino, Primofiori, or Lapithkiotiki from the Mediterranean. Varieties low in juice include Femminello, Interdonato, and Verna., When plants freezes, their water expands into ice crystals and ruptures the cell walls. Once thawed in the microwave or a 15-minute cold water bath, all that water trapped inside those cells will be ready to add to your juice.Wash and dry the lemons before freezing in an airtight container. Fresh lemons will retain quality for at least four weeks in the freezer.

, A warm lemon is easier to squeeze, and some say it even produces more juice. Zap the lemons for 10–20 seconds, or a few seconds more if frozen, until soft and slightly warm to the touch. This weakens the material that holds the juice, and causes the juice to flow more easily.This works especially well on older lemons or lemon varieties with thick skins.If the fruit is steaming, you've gone too far and boiled away some of the juice.

Preheat the grill to medium heat.,
Clean the sweet potatoes.,
Pierce the sides of each sweet potato.,
Microwave for 6 minutes.,
Wrap the sweet potatoes in foil.,
Grill the sweet potatoes for 20 minutes.,
Serve hot.",How to Grill Sweet Potatoes1," Set up a charcoal or gas grill for medium temperature direct heat.


If you have a charcoal grill, allow the grill to preheat for about 10 minutes, then redistribute the coals so that they evenly cover two-thirds of the bottom.If you have a gas grill, turn on all the burners and preheat the grill for about 10 minutes. Leave all the burners on for the duration of the cooking time.
Periodically check the temperature of the grill. Medium temperature is between 350 and 400 degrees Fahrenheit (175 and 200 degrees Celsius). You should be able to hold your hand 3 inches (7.6 cm) above the grill grate for 4 to 5 seconds before needing to pull it away.;
, Rinse each sweet potato under cool, running water. Use a vegetable brush to scrub away any visible dirt.

, Pierce each sweet potato 5 to 10 times using the tines of a fork or the tip of a sharp knife. Position these piercings evenly around all sides.


Piercing the sweet potatoes is a necessary step since the holes prevent pressure from building up inside the sweet potatoes while they cook. Theoretically, the sweet potatoes can burst in the microwave if you do not take this precaution.

, Set the pierced sweet potatoes on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave on high for 3 minutes; flip the sweet potatoes over, then continue microwaving on high for another 3 minutes.


Microwaving the sweet potatoes before grilling them helps speed up the overall cooking time.

, Place each sweet potato on a sheet of aluminum foil. Wrap the foil around the sweet potato securely, covering all sides.

, Place the wrapped sweet potatoes on the grill directly over the heat source. Cook for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are tender.

, Remove the finished sweet potatoes from the grill. Wait several minutes, then carefully remove the foil. Enjoy the grilled sweet potatoes while they’re still hot.


Consider serving the sweet potatoes with butter or olive oil. Add salt and pepper to taste.

Preheat the grill for high heat.,
Peel and slice the sweet potatoes.,
Coat the sweet potato wedges.,
Cook the wedges for 6 minutes over direct heat.,
Cook the wedges for 20 minutes over indirect heat.,
Serve hot.",How to Grill Sweet Potatoes2," Set up a charcoal or gas grill for high temperature heat. Keep separate areas for both indirect and direct grilling.


If you have a charcoal grill, preheat the grill for about 10 minutes, then redistribute the coals into two separate piles on the sides of the bottom grate. Use these piles for direct heat, and keep the center open for indirect heating.If you have a gas grill, preheat all burners for about 10 minutes, then turn off one burner for indirect heat. The lit burners can be used for direct heat.
Note that high temperatures should be between 450 and 500 degrees Fahrenheit (230 and 260 degrees Celsius). If you hold your hand 3 inches (7.6 cm) above the top grate, you should only be able to keep it there for 1 or 2 seconds before needing to pull it away., Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin from each sweet potato, then cut the potatoes into eight lengthwise wedges using a sharp knife.


If desired, you could cut the sweet potatoes into crosswise or diagonal slices instead of wedges. Note that the slices should be at least 1/4 inch (6 mm) thick, however.
To cut the sweet potatoes into wedges:

Slice the sweet potato in half lengthwise.
Slice each half in half lengthwise, forming quarters.
Slice each quarter in half lengthwise, forming eighths.



, Place the sweet potato wedges in a large mixing bowl and drizzle the olive oil over them. Toss the wedges to coat them evenly with the oil, then lightly sprinkle the wedges with salt and pepper.

, Place the sweet potato wedges on the hot grill, directly over the flame. Cook the wedges for about 3 minutes per side, using tongs to turn them halfway through.


Continue grilling the wedges over direct heat until grill marks develop on each side.

, Carefully move the sweet potato wedges to the indirectly heated portion of the grill. Cook them for 20 to 30 minutes, or until tender.


Cover the grill while the wedges sit over indirect heat. You should also turn the wedges over halfway through to promote even charring.

, Remove the finished sweet potato wedges from the grill. Drizzle them with additional melted butter or other desired toppings, then enjoy them immediately while they're still hot.

Boil water.,
Peel and slice the sweet potatoes.,
Simmer the slices for 12 minutes.,
Toss the slices with oil and seasonings.,
Grill the slices for 15 minutes.,
Serve hot.",How to Grill Sweet Potatoes3," Set up a charcoal or gas grill for medium temperature direct heat.


Allow the grill to preheat for about 10 minutes, then check the temperature every minute or so. Your grill should be between 350 and 400 degrees Fahrenheit (175 and 200 degrees Celsius). If the grill doesn't have a temperature gauge, hold your hand 3 inches (7.6 cm) above the grate; you should be able to keep it there 4 or 5 seconds before needing to pull it away.If you have a charcoal grill, redistribute the preheated coals so that they cover two-thirds of the bottom.If you have a gas grill, preheat all the burners and keep all the burners on for the entire cooking process.

, Fill a 3-qt (3-L) saucepan with approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water, then heat the water on your stove over medium-high until it reaches a boil.


Blanching the sweet potatoes before grilling them can help reduce the amount of time you need to keep them on the grill. As a result, the sweet potatoes are often more tender and less likely to burn.
You can accomplish similar results by steaming or microwaving the sweet potatoes instead of blanching. If steaming them, set up the boiling water as usual. If microwaving them, skip this step.

, Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skins from each sweet potato, then slice each one diagonally into 1/2 inch (2.5 cm) coins.


If desired, you could cut them into eight wedges instead of cutting them into coins. The wedges should be cut lengthwise, however.

, Place the sweet potato slices in the boiling water. Cover the saucepan and reduce the heat to a simmer, then allow the sweet potatoes to cook until they are almost tender (about 12 minutes). Drain the water when finished.


If steaming the slices, place them in a steamer basket and set the basket over the boiling water. Reduce the heat to a simmer, then cook for 12 to 15 minutes.If microwaving the slices, place them on a microwave-safe plate and microwave them on high for 6 to 7 minutes., Place the tender slices in a large mixing bowl and add olive oil, salt, and pepper. Toss gently with a mixing spoon to coat the slices.

, Place the sweet potato slices on the grill, spacing them apart in a single layer. Cook them for another 15 to 20 minutes, or until they feel tender.


If desired, you could brush the slices with melted butter while they cook.
Turn the slices once during the cooking process to evenly char both sides.

If you do not have an oven-safe grill pan, you can create your own substitute by laying an oven-safe wire rack inside a shallow baking sheet. The rack should be flat and secure inside the baking sheet.

, Rinse the sweet potatoes under cool, running water, scrubbing the skins with a vegetable brush as needed to remove any visible dirt.


Alternatively, you can peel the sweet potatoes using a vegetable peeler. You should still rinse the peeled sweet potatoes after removing the skin, but you do not need to scrub them clean with a brush.

, Using a sharp knife, cut the sweet potatoes into lengthwise wedges or crosswise coins.


If cutting the sweet potatoes into coins, make sure that each slice is about 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) thick.
If cutting the sweet potatoes into wedges, cut at least eight wedges. Slice each on in half lengthwise. Halve each half to create quarters, and halve each quarter to create eighths.

, Arrange the sweet potato wedges in an even, single layer over your prepared grill pan or wire rack.


Each wedge should come into direct contact with the grates of the pan. Keeping the wedges in a single layer should ensure even cooking, and keeping the wedges on the grates should better mimic the taste and texture of sweet potatoes prepared on the grill.

, For basic seasoning, brush the olive oil evenly over all of the prepared wedges. Sprinkle the wedges with generous amounts of salt and pepper.

, Place the prepared wedges in the preheated oven and “grill” them for 30 minutes, or until they become tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.


Turn or flip the wedges over halfway through the cooking time to ensure even browning and even marking.

, Remove the finished sweet potatoes from the oven. Brush them with additional butter, if desired, and enjoy them while they’re still hot.

, Airtight containers will help you to keep flour in great condition for longer. Use tall airtight containers that can be safely stored in your pantry or kitchen cupboards. Airtight containers preserve freshness and will stop insects from accessing the flour. However, if insect eggs were already in the flour, an infestation can occur but it will be contained within the container.

, However, do not overfill so that they're too heavy for you to life. In that case, split the flour between containers.

, That way you'll know how long it has been stored for and you know when it's nearing its best by date.


The best by date will be on the package. Follow the advice give, realizing that after this date, while the flour is still edible, the flavor may taste stale.
Label the exact flour type, for example, strong bread flour, plain/all-purpose flour, self raising/self rising flour, so that you're aware of the contents.

Pick out fresh green plantains.,
Peel the plantains.,
Slice the plantains into bite-sized pieces.,
Heat the oil.,
Fry the plantains.,
Dip the plantain pieces in saltwater.,
Smash the plantain pieces.,
Fry them again.,
Serve them hot with sauce.",How to Fry Plantains1," Fried green plantains are made with fresh unripe plantains. If you're new to plantains, look for large banana-shaped fruits with green skins. Green plantains are perfect for making a savory fried side dish. If you want the sweet version of fried plantains, you'll need to wait until the plantains are fully ripe.


Green plantains should be firm with green skins that have minimal bruising.
If you want, buy a bunch of plantains and use some while they're unripe and save some to make sweet plantains after a week or two.;
, The skin of green plantains is too stiff to be peeled away like that of a banana. Use a paring knife to chop the ends of the plantains. Run the knife along the plantain to slit the skin from one end to the other. Use your fingers to peel the skin from the fruit inside and completely remove the skin, then discard it.

, Lay a plantain on a cutting board and slice it on the diagonal into 1-inch pieces. This is the customary way to slice tostones.


Alternatively, slice the plantain lengthwise into long, flat strips that will curl when they fry.

, Pour the oil into a dutch oven or stockpot so that it rises up about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm). Heat it thoroughly, until it's hot enough to sizzle when you add a bit of plantain. It should reach about 340 °F (171 °C).

, Lay the plantain pieces in the hot oil and fry them until they're tender and golden, which takes about 5 minutes. Flip the plantain pieces halfway through the frying process. When they're golden, transfer them to paper towel-lined plates to drain.


Be sure to fry the plantains in a single layer, so that they cook evenly. Don't overcrowd the pot. If you need to, you can fry them in two batches.
Leave the oil on the heat, since you'll be frying the plantains once more.

, Fill a small bowl with water and a few shakes of salt. One by one, dip the plantain pieces in the saltwater. This process softens the plantain pieces a bit so that they end up creamy on the inside.


You can skip this step if you'd like, but the plantains will be a little on the dry side.

, Lay them on a plate and use the back of a spatula to smash them a bit. This will flatten the plantain pieces so they fry up crispy and thin.

, After dipping the plantain pieces in water, put them back in the hot oil to fry a second time. Fry them until they turn deep gold, about 3 more minutes, turning them as needed. When the plantains are golden brown, transfer them to a paper-towel lined plate to serve.

, Sprinkle the plantains with a bit of salt and serve them up. Fried green plantains are delicious with aioli, spicy mayonnaise, cilantro sauce, and sweet pepper sauce.

Start by deciding AHEAD OF TIME what you would like to cook.,Check your cabinets and refrigerator for supply of ingredients (having it all there speeds things up)

,Make a list of what you need

,Shop all at once rather than for each meal

,
When ready to cook a meal, get the ingredients organized (if your cupboards are organized and you've checked for all the ingredients, then you can leave them in the cupboards...if not, get everything out and put it in one area where you can see it...use a table if you don't have enough counter space)

,
THINK through the meal.,
Figure out what needs to finish cooking JUST before it is served.,
Do you need the oven heated up?,
Get the longest cooking item going first (e.g.,
Start on the medium length cooking or prep items that can sit and wait while other things are finished (e.g.,Check on your longer cooking items and adjust temperatures/seasonings/etc as needed

,Get out serving platters/bowls and start to warm any that need warming or chill any that need chilling

,Ask someone to set the table or buffet if that hasn't been done hours ago

,
Start the ""must cook just before serving"" items like steaks about 5 minutes earlier than you think you need to.,
While the final item is cooking, get longer term items into serving dishes....roasted veggies on a nice (warmed) platter, get the prepped salad out of the fridge, rice into a warmed bowl with lid (or inverted plate if you don't have a lid)

,Check the final item for cooking/timing/seasoning

,Put utensils with the items that are already dished up and get someone to put them on the table or buffet

,Have the table setter get people to the table and serve the drinks

,
Get the final item off the stove or out of the oven and onto/into the serving dish.,
Bring the final item to the table or buffet and chow down.

",How to Get Faster at Cooking," If you can think 3-4 major meals ahead (make enough for some versatile leftovers);
,,,,, Decide what takes the longest to cook (rice? beans? baked potatoes?). Figure out what can sit and stay warm while other things cook (rice? mashed potatoes? stew?)

, This will be a major organizing factor

, Special appliances out? Get those things started or rounded up.

, wash potatoes and put in the oven, or get the rice started on a back burner or in the rice cooker)

, assemble the salad, chop veggies for a soup or stir fry, arrange fruit for dessert)

,,,, This gives you time to recover from an error (forgot to heat up the gas grill...) or change plans (steaks still frozen...crap, send spouse out for rotisserie chicken and a bottle of gourmet barbecue sauce and kaiser rolls...shred chicken into sauce, heat in pan...serve on toasted kaiser rolls). If all is well with the ""must cook just before serving"" items, get started. Sauté those chicken breasts with lemon and capers, broil that salmon fillet, etc.

,,,,, Throw on a garnish to impress people (sprinkle a bit of dried parsley on the platter for the fish and put lemon slices by it if you have time). Skip this if you don't have time or aren't good at it. Presentation IS NOT everything.

Cut thick chicken breasts.,
Place the thawed chicken breast between wax paper or plastic wrap.,
Pound the chicken with a meat mallet.,
Remove the top layer of wax paper.",How to Flatten Chicken1," If you are working with especially thick breasts, it will make your job easier if you cut them before flattening them. Using a sharp knife, cut them horizontally. You can cut it all the way through, leaving you with two separate pieces, or you can cut it almost all the way through and then open it like a book.






;
, Lay down one layer of wax paper or plastic wrap on top of a large cutting board. Place the chicken breast on the wax paper. Then, cover it with another layer of wax paper or plastic wrap.








Alternatively, you can place the chicken in a plastic bag, as long as you ensure that there is no air in the bag, and there is enough extra space for the chicken to flatten out.
Many chefs prefer moistening their wax paper or plastic wrap with water to ensure that the chicken doesn't stick too much., Pound lightly in the center, making sure to use enough force to flatten the chicken. Then, move out to the sides of the breast, making sure the entire breast is even.








If you don’t have a meat mallet, you can pound the breast with a rolling pin.

, Once your chicken feels flat enough for whatever recipe you are following, or whatever dish you are preparing, remove the top layer of paper or plastic wrap. Double check that it is even. Then, you can begin spreading filling on the top, transfer it to a dish with a spatula, or whatever else your recipe calls for.








If your chicken breast is uneven or not flat enough, simply place the wax paper or plastic wrap back on it and pound out the uneven spots.

Peel your potatoes, if desired.,
Cut your chips into your desired width and shape.,
Rinse the potatoes and pat them dry with paper towels.",How to Fry Chips1," If you're not going to peel them, rinse and scrub the skins to remove any excess dirt. You want to use potatoes with a low water content -- Russet are often the best, but white and petite potatoes can do in a pinch., Depending on your personal preferences you can cut the chips however you'd like. Note that thinner cuts lead to crispier fires, while thicker chips will retain more of their soft, pillowy interior:


French fries are strips as long as the length of the potato, roughly 1/2"" (1.3 cm) thick
Chips are round 1/2"" (1.3 cm) thick cross-sections of the potato, cut lengthwise through
Wedges are usually 1-inch (2.5 cm) thick, cut by creating 3 cuts through the end of the end of the potato in a star shape.

, This removes excess water, which slows down frying. The big goal when frying potatoes is to make sure they are crispy -- and excess water makes this difficult. Use paper towels to blot away as much water from the outside of the potatoes as you can."

Plastic cutting boards are preferable to wooden cutting boards, because they can be washed at high temperatures in a dishwasher to remove bacteria.








, First, locate the backbone, which runs straight down the chicken. Then, you can use either a sharp knife or kitchen shears to begin cutting it. Cut parallel to the backbone on both sides. Cut along the length of the backbone from the next to the tail, until you can remove the backbone entirely.







, This part can be a bit tricky, and don't be afraid to really get messy, and get in there. Pull the two sides of the chicken apart, so that you can see underneath the breast of the chicken. Look for a small white piece of gristle at the top portion of the chicken. Cut through it, and then cut gently down that line to the tail of the chicken.








, Insert your index and middle finger until you find can feel it between your fingers, between the two breasts. Dig your fingers down each side of the keel bone and pull it away from the skin. Remove the keel bone. 







, Once you've removed the keel bone, you can bend that chicken and flatten it out for baking, grilling, or whatever else you have in mind. If you desire, you can cut the chicken in half, or cook it whole

Spatchcocking is an alternate method to flatten a whole chicken, making it simple for barbecuing a chicken or baking it in the oven quickly., The parson's nose is the fleshy bit that pokes out of the end of the chicken, between the legs facing you. Using your kitchen shears, cut down the chicken in two lines on either side. It's important to use sharp shears, because you will be cutting through rib bones as you do this. Go down either side of the parson's nose, until you reach the other side of the chicken. Remove the strip you've just cut., Now that you've removed that strip, you can open your chicken up. Lay it flat on your cutting board, and use the heel of your hand to press down. By doing this, you'll ensure the chicken cooks more evenly. There is no exact science to this – simply press down firmly on all parts of the chicken until it's relatively the same thickness throughout., By poking skewers through your flattened chicken, you will help keep it flat throughout the cooking process. Use two skewers, threading them through breast and thigh meat. When you're finished, they should form an ""X"" shape, piercing enough meat to hold that flattened shape.Now, you're ready to cook your chicken."

A candy thermometer is a great way to gauge temperature if you don't have a deep fryer.

, Crispy chips are fried not one but twice. In between, you must cool the potatoes and drain excess oil -- thus the paper towels.

, Without a thermometer, you can test the oil by placing a scrap of bread in the oil to see how quickly it browns. It should bubble gently and brown within 45 seconds. Once the potatoes hit, they will naturally lower the temperature of the oil to about 360F/180C. Keep it this way by lowering the heat to medium.


If using a deep fryer, reset the temperature to 360F/180C once the potatoes hit.
Make sure that the potatoes are completely covered in hot oil, stirring once but mostly leaving alone until done.

, They should just be turning soft, with no more than a little golden coloring. Use a slotted or mesh spoon to pull the fries out, leaving the hot oil. Pat dry with paper towels.


You can cut the heat to the oil on the stove or deep fryer.
Try more than 1 minute if you like your chips/wedges fluffy in the middle not rock solid.

, During this first fry, water molecules in the potato heat up and flee from the center of the chip, making it to the edges of the fry. As the potato cools, this water mixes with the starch and oil to form an invisible, gummy coating. This coating, which is cooked during the second fry, is the crispy, delicious exterior that makes the best chips., This means using your medium-high setting once more. Remember, a piece of bread dropped in the oil should be bubbling and browned in 20-30 seconds. If using a thermometer, note how the oil temperature once again drops to about 400F/205C. Try and keep it here.

, Once they look good to you, they are good to come out of the oven. Note that the fries tend to darken up just a little as they cool, so take them out 15-20 seconds before they are perfectly golden brown to get the best results.


Make sure, once more, that all the potatoes are covered in the hot oil as they cook.

, Again, get all the excess grease off, otherwise the fries will become gross and soggy. Once they are cool enough to eat, dig in.


If adding seasoning, toss it into the fries while they are still nice and hot -- this helps distribute the salt and seasoning more evenly.

Taste the food.,
Identify compatible flavors.,

Evaluate the idea of adding to a dish after it is finished cooking.,
Put seasoning elements in a sauce.",How to Fix an Underseasoned Dish," Professional chefs recommend tasting a dish several times, starting early on and setting up a feedback loop that will help the cook to understand whether a dish is correctly seasoned, or if something needs to be added.


Have a taste-tester. Many professional chefs actually have other people taste their food while it is in the kitchen just to double check that the flavor combinations are right and that the dish is seasoned correctly.;
, Before adding elements to the dish if your taste test comes out lacking, figure out what kinds of flavors will present well with what is already in the mix. Adding incompatible flavors can kill a dish, so think about this carefully before throwing in whatever else happens to be on hand.


Think about herbs, spices and flavorings as falling into various genres or categories. Keeping these items categorized in your head, you will be able to prevent the problem of warring flavors in a dish.
Consider falling back on some traditional flavorings that have a wider compatibility. Salt and pepper are the old standbys for dishes that will meet a North American audience, while in many other parts of the world, mainstay ingredients include hot peppers, allspice or other natural elements.
Be careful with sweet spices like cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg or others. Although these strong elements can give a dish a great flavor when used in moderation, a heavy-handed approach will most likely fail.

, After a tasting has determined that more seasoning is needed, add elements slowly into the mix, so as to avoid over-seasoning the dish.

, Some additional flavoring is in the form of garnishes. These items can help flavor a dish as well as add to its presentation.


Reconsider salt and pepper and other basics. Although some professional cooks warn against over salting or over seasoning a dish that has already been plated, this can be an effective way of dressing up some dishes.
Consider parmesan cheese and similar dairy garnishes. Although parmesan is among the most common, other types of grated cheese may also impart flavor and seasoning to a dish.

, For many cooks, and many culinary audiences, there's nothing wrong with a bit of sauce to finish up a dish and present more bold flavors. Nearly any kind of flavor can be added in the form of a sauce, which can be mixed into the dish or served on the side for more picky palates.

Keep some distance between you and your guests.",How to Flambe," Whether you plan to flambé a roast, a fish, a fruit dish, or a dessert, lay everything out in front of you to make sure you have what you need before you begin. Measure out the alcohol you will be using and lay out the matches or lighter for later.






;
, The alcohol content in your liquor is important because it will determine the flammability of your dish. A higher alcohol content is too combustible and may put your safety at risk. On the other hand, a lower alcohol content may not ignite at all.

, For developed flavors, pair rum or fruit flavored brandy with fruit dishes and desserts and pair whiskey or cognac with meats.Ultimately, go with the liquor profile you like best. For example, feel free to use gin or vermouth on savory dishes if that's your alcohol of choice.

, Follow the recipe you have in front of you. Keep in mind, there will be extra steps depending on what you are making. Some traditional flambéed dishes include crepes Suzette, bananas foster, and Chateaubriand.








, Cold or cool liquor won't ignite, which could ruin your food. Heat the alcohol on your stovetop using a saucepan with high sides. Keep the liquor over the flame until you see bubbles just beginning to form at around 130 degrees Fahrenheit or 54 degrees Celsius.








Instead of heating the alcohol on a stovetop, use a microwave. Set it to 100 percent power and make sure to use a microwave-safe bowl. Heat the liquor for 30 to 45 seconds for optimum results., If you do not have one, you can use a large skillet with a long handle and deep sides. Make sure everything is at the proper temperature and check that there are matches or a lighter near by.


For fruit dishes, use a preheated shallow pan.For meat dishes, use a cast iron or enamel roasting pan., Once your dish is ready, add the liquor to the pan. Remove the pan from the ignited burner before you add the alcohol. This is especially important if you are using a gas burner.Pour gently, tilting the pan away from yourself and your guests.








, Remove the pan from the burner and use a long barbecue lighter or a long match to light it.Light the pan right away so the food doesn't risk absorbing the raw liquor, which can ruin its flavor. Try to ignite the vapors rather than the liquid alcohol directly.








, Once the dish is lit, put your pan back down on the burner. Shake the pan lightly over the stove so the flames and alcohol distribute evenly. Evenly distributed alcohol creates an evenly distributed flavor.







, After about 15-30 seconds the alcohol will cook off and the flames will die.Let the fire go out naturally so the astringent alcohol flavor burns off. To keep the alcohol flavor, cover the flames with a lid before they have gone out naturally.







, Plate and serve your dish immediately after the flames die down. No cooling time is needed, meaning nothing will stand between you and your delicious meal.

, Tuck in your shirt, fold up your sleeves, and secure any loose fabric flying around to keep it away from the flames. Tie up your hair to get it out of your face and clear of the burners.

, Close the overhead fan or hood over your stove so it won't accidentally draw the flame up.Turn off the burners as well so they won't flare while you cook.








, Make sure the lid fits tightly and fully covers the pan you will be using in case the flame becomes too big. If the flame gets too large, immediately cover it with the lid. If you deprive the flame of oxygen, it will die out.







, If you pour liquor directly from the bottle to the stove, flames could shoot up the liquor stream.Instead, pour the liquor once the pan has been removed from the flame and then use a long match or lighter. Exercise extra caution by storing the warmed liquor in a flame resistant container.








, Make sure they are far enough away from the dish that they're not coming into contact with the flames. A serving cart is ideal to let your guests see what you're doing while keeping them at a distance.

Ensure that the fat or oil is clean and clear.,
Ensure that the fat or oil in which you are frying the food is hot enough.,
Heat the fat or oil until it is quite still.,
Check the heat with a thermometer to ensure that the fat is heated adequately.,
Fry the food as instructed in the recipe.

",How to Fix Batter That Falls Off," Do not reuse old fat or oil with former fried food pieces, etc. in it. Some oil can be reused provided it is clean but this is not recommended on the whole; see ""Tips"".;
, It is really important to use fat or oil that is able to take high temperatures, such as peanut oil. Good fats for deep frying include:


Butter, ghee
Corn oil
Cottonseed oil
Lard
Macadamia nut oil
Peanut oil
Rice bran oil
Walnut oil, You will see a little blue smoke rising. This is known as its ""smoke point"", the temperature at which the fat or oil gives off smoke. The smoke point of oil is affected by the purity and age of the oil., This step is optional if you don't have a thermometer but it is very helpful.

Familiarize yourself with the four tastes.,
Learn which ingredients can be used to adjust each taste.,
Assess the problem with your dish.,
Dilute the dish.,
Add raw potato to your dish.,
If your dish is too spicy, balance the heat with some sweetness.,
If your dish is still too spicy, serve it alongside a dairy product.",How to Fix an Over Seasoned Dish," There are four commonly recognized tastes that you can manipulate in your cooking: sweet, salty, sour and bitter. The goal when cooking is to achieve a balance between these tastes. An over-seasoned dish is likely to have one of these flavors dominate; fixing this problem is achieved through the adjustment of the other three flavors.;
, There are some basic ingredients, which you can employ to alter the flavors in your food; it's helpful to keep these ingredients on hand at all times.


Ingredients that make a dish saltier include salt, soy sauce and fish sauce.






Ingredients that make a dish sweeter include sugar, molasses and honey.






Ingredients that make a dish more sour include citrus juice, wine, and vinegar.






Ingredients that make a dish bitterer include beer and cocoa.







, Which flavor is out of balance? Once you have answered that question, correct the problem by adding some ingredients to amplify the other tastes. For example, if your dish is too salty, try adding some lemon juice and sugar to balance it out. If a dish is too sweet, adding a pinch of salt can remedy the problem.

, If you have over-seasoned a soup, stew or sauce, you can fix the problem by diluting the dish. Add a splash or two of water and then taste the dish. By adding water, you will cause the overall flavor of your dish to be less intense, but if you have over-seasoned, the results can be positive.

, If your soup or stew is too salty, adding raw potato is a good option. Slice the potato into small chunks (to expose a good bit of surface area) and then stir them in. The potato acts like a salt sponge, absorbing some of the salt right out of your dish. Cook the potato in the dish for several minutes, and then discard it.

, If you were a little heavy-handed with the chili peppers, add some sugar or honey to the dish to correct the problem.

, Dairy complements spicy foods nicely; a protein in milk called casein binds with the heat-causing agent in spices and peppers called capsaicin, keeping it from binding instead to your mouth's pain receptors. Most cultures with spicy cuisine exploit this fact. Spicy Mexican food is served with sour cream, hot Indian curries are paired with yogurt, and Buffalo wings come alongside bleu cheese.

Choose pungent onions.,
Trim off the leaves.,
Transfer the onions to a warm, protected area.,
Consider curing the onions in a braid.,
Trim back the tops.,
Store the onions in a cool, dry place.During the winter, for instance, you can usually keep the onions in your basement.",How to Dry Onions1," Mild onions do not cure well, so when you want to air dry or cure onions for winter storage, pungent onions are a better choice.As a general rule, mild onions care usually quite large and have paper-like skins the are easy to peel. When cut open, the onions are juicy and the rings are fairly thick.
Pungent onions are notably smaller in size and tend to have tight skins. When cut open, the rings will be notably thinner and your eyes will likely begin to water.
Mild onions will only last, dried or cured, for a month or two at most. In contrast, pungent onions can last all winter in ideal conditions.
The sulfurous compounds that cause tears to form in your eyes when you cut a pungent onion also slow down the rotting process.
Popular varieties of pungent onions include the Candy, Copra, Red Weathersfield, and Ebenezer.;
, Snip away any shriveled leaves with scissors or shears and gently clean off the roots by brushing off any large clumps of soil.


This step is only necessary if the onions have been harvested from your garden. If you are buying them from the store, odds are, the leaves and dirt have already been removed.
Note that the onion should only be harvested after the leaves on the plant have begun to weaken and ""flop"" over, indicating that the plant has stopped growing. Only fully matured onions should be cured for winter storage.
Note that you should also dry or cure your onions as soon as you harvest them for best results.

, Place the onions in a single layer in a shed or pantry with temperatures ranging between 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius) and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius).Let the onions cure in this initial stage for a full week.
If the weather outside is still dry and warm, and you do not need to worry about animals getting into your onion crop, you can usually let them lay in the garden for the first few days. Usually, though, you will need to move them into a garage, shed, or covered porch.
Be careful as you move the onions. They can bruise if you bump them together too roughly. You should also avoid touching them during this initial drying stage.
Do not place the onions in direct sunlight since doing so can cause uneven drying.

, You can either finish curing the onions by laying them out flat, but you could also finish curing them by weaving the tops into a braid.


Braid the onions together by trimming off all the leaves aside from the three newest. Tie or braid these remaining leaves to the leaves of other onions being cured and hang them vertically to finish drying.
Note that this is typically a matter of personal preference or space constraints since, according to research, onions do not do better or worse whether they dry braided or laid out flat.
Allow the onions to cure in this manner for a total of four to six weeks.

, As the onions cure, you should trim back the tops two or three times as the stem shrinks. Cut the rest of the necks off when the onions have cured completely. The roots should also be trimmed off.


Trim the tops back two or three times during the curing process.
After the onions finish curing/drying, cut the necks off completely.
After the first week or two of drying, you should also use scissors to trim the roots of the onion to 1/4 inch (6 mm).

,


Place the onions in mesh bags, a bushel basket, or a flat cardboard box with holes punched into it. Only place three onions or so into a small space so that they have plenty of air circulation.
At a temperature of 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius), pungent onions can last for 6 to 9 months and mild onions can last two weeks to one month.

"
"
Preheat the oven to 140 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius).Prepare two or more baking sheets by lining them with parchment paper.On average, you will need one to two standard baking sheets for every one onion you intend to dry using this method.,
Cut the onions into thin slices.,
Spread the onions out onto the baking sheets.,
Dry the onion in the preheated oven.,
Crumble when done.,
Store in a cool, dry place.",How to Dry Onions2," If you are only drying one onion, prepare two baking sheets. If you are drying two onions, prepare three or four baking sheets, and so on. It is better to give the onions too much space than to provide too little.
Do not allow the temperature to rise above 140 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius) during the drying process. If the oven does rise above this temperature, you may end up burning or dry-roasting the onion instead of drying it.
The trays you use should be about 2 inches (5 cm) narrower than the inside of your oven to provide sufficient air circulation.

, The root, top, and skins should be removed, and the onions should be chopped or sliced into 1/4 or 1/8 inch (6.35 or 3.175 mm) rings.


The easiest way to slice onions for this purpose is to use a mandoline. If you do not have this particular kitchen utensil, though, you could also slice the onions as thin as possible using your sharpest kitchen knife.

, Transfer the onion slices to your prepared baking sheets and spread them out in a single layer.


If you pile the onions onto a baking sheet, they will take longer to dry and may dry unevenly when all is said and done. This could create problems later on if you accidentally store a few onions that have not been thoroughly dried.

, Place the onion in the oven and dry them for 6 to 10 hours, turning the trays as needed to minimize the risk of scorching.


If possible, keep the door of the oven propped open with a 4-inch (10-cm) gap or so to prevent the inside of the oven from getting too hot. If you do this, you may also want to position a fan at the opening to force the air inside to circulate more effectively.
Keep about 3 inches (7.6 cm) of empty space in between trays and in between the top tray and the top of the oven. There needs to be plenty of air circulation.
Keep a close eye on the onions as they near the end of the drying process since they may end up scorching if left inside the oven too long. Scorching can ruin the taste and make the onions less nutritious.

, When done, the onions will be brittle enough to crumble with your hands. You can create onion flakes in this manner.


For onion flakes, only crush the onions likely with your hands. For onion powder, place the onions in a plastic bag and roll over them using a rolling pin.
You could also leave the onions slices whole, but note that they will be brittle and delicate, so they can break apart easily if handled roughly.

, Place the onion flakes in an airtight container and store in a pantry cupboard or similar storage area.


If vacuum-sealed, dried onion can last for up to 12 months. In slightly less airtight conditions, the onions can last anywhere from 3 to 9 months.
Watch out for moisture. If you spot any moisture inside the container during the first few days of storage, take the onions out, dry them further, and dry the container before placing them back in. Moisture can cause the dried onions to spoil faster.

Prepare the onions.,
Place the onions onto dehydrator trays.,
Run the dehydrator for about 12 hours.,
Store the dried onions in an airtight container.,
Finished.

",How to Dry Onions3," The onions should be peeled and sliced into rings that are 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) thick.


Cut off the root end of the onion and peel off the skins.
Use a mandoline to slice the onion if you have one, using the smallest or second smallest setting available. If you do not have a mandoline, using your sharpest kitchen knife to cut the onion as thin as possible.

, Arrange the onion slices onto your dehydrator trays in a single layer, positioning the trays so that they can receive plenty of air circulation.


The onions slices or rings should not overlap or touch. Keep them fairly spread apart to maximize air circulation.
The trays should also positioned far apart within the dehydrator. Keep at least 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of space in between trays to maximize circulation.

, If your dehydrator has a thermostat, run it at 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius) until the rings dry.If you have an older or cheaper dehydrator that does not have a thermostat, you need to monitor the drying time more closely. The amount of time might need to be increased or decreased by an hour or so, and you can monitor the temperature with an oven-safe thermometer to gauge how big a time difference you need to account for.

, Keep the onions in a cool, dry location. Use them in your cooking or eat them plain.


If you vacuum seal the dried onions, they can last for up to 12 months. In slightly less airtight conditions, the onions can last 3 to 9 months.
Watch out for moisture. If you spot any moisture inside the container during the first few days of storage, take the onions out, dry them further, and dry the container before placing them back in. Moisture can cause the dried onions to spoil faster.

Do not leave it sitting out for more than two hours. If you want to cool your food down for storing in the fridge or freezer, or if you think it will take longer than 2 hours for your food to cool, click here.;
, A small amount of food will cool faster than a large amount of food. If you are trying to cool off a solid, such as a piece of steak or a potato, try cutting it into smaller pieces. If you are trying to cool off a liquid, try pouring it into a larger, but shallower container—or into two, smaller containers.

, The moving air will help shift the heat away from your food. Be sure to stir the food often so that it cools evenly. If you don't have a fan, try fanning it with a stiff sheet of paper or folder instead. You can also blow on your food, in a pinch.

, The food closest to the surface will cool down the fastest. By stirring your food up, you will be bringing the hot food up to the surface so that it can cool down. The already-cool food will sink to the bottom and help cool the rest of your meal down.

, Stir the soup every so often to help distribute the coldness. The one downside to this is that the melting ice can dilute the flavor of the soup.


You can also use plastic, reusable ice cubes instead. They won't melt and release water into your soup.

, Press down on the bowl (or plate) so that it sits snugly on top of the pack. Stir the food every so often so that it cools evenly.

But anything with walls that are around 4 inches (10 cm) tall or more will get the job done just fine.


For the purpose of this article, we'll assume you're not working with a deep fryer. If you are, you're better off reading the instruction booklet for your particular model. It'll probably say something like, ""Turn on. Fill to fill line. Put in food."" It'll be very straightforward!;
, But if you don't have them, don't fret. Here's the gist on why these things are helpful but not necessary:


Many places swear that you need, need, need a thermometer. Your oil has to be around 350ºF (150ºC) (depending on the recipe) and the only way to know is a thermometer. However, if you don't have one, you can use a wooden spoon. If you put the tip in and the oil boils around it, you should be okay.

But if you plan on making a habit of this, it's best to invest in a thermometer.


Tongs, a fry basket, and a deep fry spoon are mainly for your safety. The last thing you want is hot oil on your skin, and these give you an extra foot or so of wiggle room. But they're not necessary for the process, no.

, You want what's called a ""neutral"" oil with a high smoke point. Your best bets are peanut, soybean, grapeseed, sunflower, and pecan oils, or a blend of them. Restaurants often keep some previously used oil and add that to new oil to improve the frying process.


Can you use olive oil? Well, sure -- if you don't mind a burned, bitter taste and you're keeping it below 350ºF (150ºC). Olive oil has a lower smoke point (read: it'll burn more easily) than most other oils.Canola and vegetable oil are totally acceptable, cheap options, too. If you're in a pinch, these will be totally fine.
If you're rolling in the dough, use shortening or lard -- it'll result in food that's crispier and less greasy. Non-hydrogenated lard or beef fat is primo, top-shelf stuff., How much do you need? Well, it depends on what you're frying and how big your vessel is. A good rule of thumb: the minimum is whatever will submerge your food about halfway. But if you have enough room and enough oil, aim for full submersion.


If your pan is on the shallow side, you want it about half full; a few inches of space is necessary for inevitable splashing.

, It should be in the range of 300-375ºF (150-190ºC). If your recipe doesn't clearly indicate it, your best bet is 325º to 350ºF (160-175ºC). That should equate to medium to medium high heat. Lower than that and your food won't crisp -- any higher and it'll burn before it's even close to done.


If you're sans a thermometer and you don't trust the wooden spoon method, there are a couple of other things you can try. A pinch of flour will sizzle nicely and not burn if you're at a good temperature; popcorn will pop nicely, too. And if you do a trial with your first piece of food, it should sink a little and then pop right back up. If it's too cold, it'll sink and stay there. Too hot and it'll never break the surface.

But again, a thermometer is best. These aren't super scientific methods.



, Adding water to a pot of hot oil is just about the opposite of a good idea. It can cause the oil to jump and, worst case scenario, boil over your pot. Need a better reason? Frying is about removing water from your food. You're kinda defeating the process and asking for soggier food if there's extra water around.So pat it down before you put it in.

, Tongs or a basket can help keep things from splashing, but if you don't have those, just take it slow and easy. For long or large items, place the bottom of the item in oil and set the rest of it in away from you, ensuring that any splash or spatter goes the other direction.


Many novices get a little spooked and end up dropping in the food from feet above the pan. In two words: terrible idea. It'll just splash everywhere. You want to drop in the food from as close to the oil as possible. If you have a long item, submerge it slowly, only dropping it when most of it is already in the oil.
If you dump all of your food in there at once, the temperature of the oil will drop significantly. Instead, take it slow, bit by bit.

, You want the oil to be on all sides of your food; if pieces are crowding together, they won't brown evenly. So make sure every piece has its own little turf to get the best, even crisp.


It's a good idea to keep the food moving for heating purposes, too. The room temperature food does bring down the temperature of the oil, so moving the food around prevents little pockets of cooler oil from forming.

, Some items will take 30 seconds while others will take a few minutes. If you're deep frying a bowling ball, it'll take a bit longer -- but traditional things like chicken, doughnuts, and french fries won't take long at all. To know if something is done you can:


Look at it. If it is golden brown it is probably done, but you should make sure the inside is properly cooked, especially for larger pieces of food.
Stick a probe thermometer into it. Some even come with internal temperatures indicators that tell you when different things are done.
Stick a toothpick in. If it is at the desired level of softness then it is probably done. Some things need further testing.
Take a taste test. If it tastes done then it should be done. Only do this if the food is absolutely OK to eat; foods like eggs need to be properly cooked before tasting.

For this, make sure it's cooled down! A burned tongue can't taste the deliciousness that is about to ensue.



, Your spider utensil will come in handy right about now, or you can use your tongs or just a spoon. Just don't use your fingers!


Be sure to turn the stove off! Grease fires are no fun. But while we're on that note, they're best suffocated by baking soda, a damp towel, or a fire extinguisher. Do not go running through the house with the pan, trying to escape.

, That's what the tray (or plate) with paper towels is for. You could place it on a wire rack, but the absorption powers of the paper towels will be more effective than the excess oil just dripping off when it feels like.


Be sure all sides are drained to prevent any inevitable song. Pat all sides and flip your food as necessary, replacing the paper towels if need be.
If you're worried about your food becoming cold, you can throw it in your oven at a lower temperature (150-200ºF or 65-90ºC) to keep it warm. This is a good idea if you're waiting for the rest of your meal to finish, too.

, This part is all you. Salt? Pepper? Cumin, paprika, dill, curry, garlic, lemon? Of course, you can omit this stage, too! But if you do want to season, know that you should do it now. The tastes will absorb best while the food is still warm.

, Don't pour it down your drain! Don't do it! It's terrible for your drains and the environment -- and you can keep it for next time! Take a strainer or skimmer and get out all the solid bits that have escaped (do throw those away). Pour the oil (if it's not scalding hot) into a cup, and then funnel it into a container and place it in the fridge for safe-keeping. You can use the same oil several times over and your food will taste just as good.


Skeptical? Don't be. You will 100% know when oil has gone bad. It'll turn dark brown and smell terrible. If that's the case, keep it in its container and throw it out.
Never throw hot oil into a plastic garbage bag. That's asking for trouble. Always wait until your oil has cooled down before you do anything with it.

, One of the most basic things you can make using this method is french fries. It's pretty hard to create a nasty french fry and the sheer volume gives you lots of opportunities to perfect your strategy. You could also deep fry homemade potato chips or hashbrowns, too!


Bored of regular ol' french fries? How about sweet potato fries?!

, A turkey, when deep fried, can be ready in as little as 45 minutes. If you're looking for a spin on Thanksgiving (or just this weekend), you've found it! The wikiHow article is complete with sweet, sweet GIFs and all.

, You've probably been to those restaurants that advertise this and inside you're always thinking, ""How do they do it?!"" Now you can do it yourself! You'll be the hit of any party with your hot and cold powers.


This can be done with any flavor and any type of outer coating. Don't just stick to vanilla and cornflakes if you don't want to!

, You can make this as classy and sophisticated as you'd like. Either turn your string cheese into homemade mozzarella cheese bites or get all fancy with fried, French cheeses as a modern take on an hors d'oeuvre. No matter your route, fried cheese? Good.


You can use a salsa-like dip, but jam is equally to die for!

, Alright, it's time to put your cholesterol to the test. You've heard about it at state fairs, but up until now it was just myth. Now deep fried candy bars are in the comfort of your own home! Quick, what's an excuse to have a party this weekend? Everyone can bring their favorite candy bar and make a night of it! God, technology is amazing.

Remove items with tongs or a slotted spoon.",How to Fry1," Butter and other oils with a low smoke point shouldn’t be used. The best choices are canola oil, grapeseed oil, vegetable oil, corn oil, peanut oil, safflower oil and sunflower oil.


Olive oil is also a popular choice for small, shallow fried foods.;
, It should be deep enough for shallow frying most foods, but you can also use a deeper cast-iron skillet. You will only fill the frying pan about one-fourth way full of oil.

, If the oil gets too hot and starts smoking, you are likely to burn yourself. Wear long sleeves, an apron and keep oven mitts nearby.








, If you insert a wooden spoon into the oil, it should bubble around the edges. You can also use a deep fry thermometer if you want to be more accurate.








, Never drop them from far away. Splashing oil can cause severe burns.








, You may need to check the bottom edge by turning it up lightly with a spatula.








, Try to cook in batches of food that is the same size, so that you can keep a constant cook time.

, Lay them on paper towels to drain and dry. Serve as soon as you can.

Cook meat or vegetables in a hot pan.,
Remove ingredients and skim off excess fat.,
Choose a deglazing liquid.,
Pour in the liquid.,
Scrape at fond until it dissolves.,
Pour over the dish or turn into a pan sauce.,
Add aromatic ingredients.,
Heat until reduced.,
Finish with fat (optional).,
Strain the sauce (optional).",How to Deglaze a Pan," Preheat a wide pan, add fat, and continue heating until the oil shimmers, or the butter browns lightly.Add ingredients and cook with minimal stirring. Properly seared meat or sautéed vegetables will leave a brown, sticky residue at the bottom of the pan. This is the ""fond,"" and it contains the flavors that will join your deglazing liquid.Stainless steel or enameled cast iron encourage good fonds, and their light color makes it easy to track progress and avoid burning.Nonstick pans are less effective, and reactive metal pans may corrode if deglazed with acid.Leave ¼—½ inch (6–13mm) of space between pieces of meat.If overcrowded or cooked at too low a temperature, the meat will steam and fail to form a good fond.;
, Transfer the meat or vegetables once they are done cooking, leaving the fond behind. If the pan still contains a lot of fat, spoon it off or pour it through a strainer, returning crusty brown solids to the pan. Too much fat makes the sauce greasy and increases spatter as you deglaze.

, Wine, homemade stock, or an equal mix of the two are all popular options. If it suits your dish, you can use almost any flavorful liquid. For example, beer works well for robust meat dishes and earthy vegetables, while fruit juice can create a sweet sauce to pair with pork. You can even deglaze with water if you're low on supplies, but this misses the opportunity to add flavor.Just avoid dairy, which may curdle over heat.Cognac or brandy make a particularly strong sauce, but the vapors may burst into flames. Keep the pan away from flames while pouring, use a long handled pan, and do not put your face over the liquid. Flambéing typically has little effect on flavor, so you can continue to deglaze if this happens — just stay safe.Liquors above 120-proof are too dangerous for this purpose., As a rule of thumb, use 1 cup (240 mL) liquid for an entree that serves four. Keep in mind that the liquid will reduce down to about half its original volume, and gain an intense flavor.If you don't have time to reduce the sauce, cut the amount of liquid in half.


Add the liquid slowly or in stages. This will keep the pan hot to help the fond dissolve faster.

, Heat over a medium-high burner while scraping the base of the pan with a wooden or rubber tool. Continue until the liquid is boiling and most of the fond has dissolved.

, Deglazing is a flexible technique. If you're in a hurry, you can use the deglazing liquid as soon as the fond has dissolved. To transform the deglazing liquid into a richer pan sauce, continue to the next section.

, A handful of minced garlic or shallots helps the flavor immensely.You can also add herbs, matching them with the main dish ingredients, or — if you have more time — cook mushrooms, carrots, celery, or onions in the deglazing liquid.


Add a little salt and pepper now, then taste-test at the end to decide if you need more. A stock-based sauce may already be quite salty after reducing.

, Boil until about half the liquid is gone, and the remainder is almost syrupy. This concentrates the flavor and evaporates some of the alcohol if present.If your deglazing liquid is marinade that has been in contact with raw meat, make sure it reaches a rolling boil before serving., For a smooth, rich, sauce, remove the pan from heat and swirl in a bit of cream or melted butter.

, For an even texture, pour the sauce through a strainer before serving. This step is not necessary unless you are going for a restaurant-style presentation.

Select young tender shoots on the end of stems and snip them off plants with a small pair of scissors.,
Look for fresh thyme in a grocery store.,
Put the ends of fresh thyme cuttings in a glass of water as you would flowers in a vase until you are ready to use it.,Wash the stems under cold running water and pick off any yellowed leaves just before you are ready to use fresh thyme.,
Read your recipe to determine how to prepare the fresh thyme.",How to Cook With Thyme1," You can harvest thyme at any time, but preferably just before use.
, It should look vibrantly green and firm, not yellowed and limp.,

Place the glass in the refrigerator.

Cool your food quickly before storing it in the fridge or freezer.,
Keep the air flowing.,
Keep thick foods, such as refried beans and stews, in loosely-covered, shallow pans or pots.,
Try an ice bath for soups.,
Try an ice paddle or a cooling paddle.,
Use some ice instead of water in your recipe.,
Cut solid food down into smaller portions.",How to Cool Food Quickly2," If you store warm food in the fridge/freezer, the surrounding food will begin to thaw and spoil. Your food also won't cool evenly. At the same time, you need to cool it quickly, or your food will become a breeding ground for bacteria. If you plan on storing your food in the fridge/freezer, it must reach 40°F (4°C) first.


According to food safety specialists, the ""danger zone"" for food is between 140°F and 40° F (60°C and 4°C). Bacteria grows and breeds at these temperatures. Food should not remain in the ""danger zone"" for more than two hours. Once the food has reached 40°F (4°C) it is safe to be stored in the fridge/freezer., Try to have a fan on or a window open. This will help stir the air, and move the hot air away from the cooling food. If you have a free-standing fan, point it at the food you want to chill.

, The pan should be about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) tall, and the food inside should be no more than 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) deep.Stir the food often to help release heat. Keep the pan loosely covered when you are not stirring the food to prevent contamination.


This method is also good for liquids, such as soups and sauces.
Try to use metal containers, such as stainless steel, instead of plastic or glass. They will cool down.If you can't find any shallow containers, then spread the food in a thin, 2 inch (5.08 centimeters) deep layer across the bottom of a larger container.

, Fill a sink with ice and some cold water to make a ""slush."" Place the pot with food in it into the sink. The food should be level with the icy water. Stir the food every 10 to 15 minutes. This helps it cool more evenly.Check the temperature of the food with a meat thermometer. When the food reaches 40°F (4°C) you can store it in the fridge/freezer.
The ice will melt over time. When this happens, pour out the excess water and add more ice.
If the food is taking too long to cool, separate it into smaller containers., These are what commercial kitchens use for cooling soups and similar food items. They are plastic paddles that are filled with water, and then frozen. Simply stir your soup with the ice or cooling paddle until it reaches the required temperature.The benefit to using ice or cooling paddles is that you won't dilute the flavor or texture of your soup.
Consider wearing a glove or oven mitt to protect your hand from the cold paddle.
This can be combined with an ice bath for even faster chilling.

, Follow the original recipe, but use less water. Towards the end of the cooking process, add some ice. Make sure that the amount of ice you are using makes up for the amount of water you reduced.You can plop in a few ice cubes after you have finished your sauce or soup instead, but the ice will add more water to your food once it melts, and dilute the flavor.

, This is ideal for things like meat, but can also be used for other items, such as lasagna and enchiladas. If you are going to freeze any of these items, you will likely to cut them down into small portions to make defrosting and reheating easier. Try to cut these foods down into individual-sized portions. They will cool down much faster."

Purchase a deep fry thermometer.,
Choose your oil.,
Invest in a counter top fryer, a wok or a deep frying pan.,
Put on your apron, long-sleeves and oven mitts when you are moving oil.,
Heat your oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 Celsius).,
Group items in batches of similar size.,
Towel off wet items with a paper towel before you place them in the oil.,
Place the items into the hot oil with several inches of space between them.,
Remove items when they reach a golden brown.,
Serve deep fried food as soon as the surface is dry.

",How to Fry2," This will allow you to monitor the temperature of the oil. Food that is fried too hot will burn, while food that is fried at too low a temperature will be soggy.

, The fact that deep-frying requires more oil means that you are more likely to look at cost of the oil. Canola oil, peanut oil and vegetable shortening work well at low cost., You may be able to get a deep fry with a cast iron skillet and small or thin pieces of dough, vegetables or meat. If you want to fry a whole turkey, you will need to invest in a large turkey fryer.


Remember that you should never fill the receptacle more than halfway full of oil.

, Frying can be messy and dangerous. However, you can learn to reduce the chance of burns by keeping your oil at the right temperature.

, Insert your deep fry thermometer and check it frequently so that your oil has a steady temperature. You can also check by throwing a cube of white bread into it, and checking if it takes the optimal one-minute to fry.

, This way you can adjust frying times. With deep fat frying, there is no need to flip the item over.

, It will minimize splattering.








, Overcrowding items leads to uneven frying. If you are frying a batch of small items, buy a frying basket.









Larger items can be dropped gently from a short distance to avoid splashing.

, Use a slotted spoon or a basket to get them out of the pan. Then, let them dry on paper towels, to keep them from getting soggy.

, All the fish to sit in the lime juice mixture for at least 8 hours or until the fish turns white and opaque. Stir it occasionally as it sits to make sure that the lime juice is evenly distributed.


The acid in the lime juice breaks the fish down in a chemical reaction that actually ""cooks"" the fish without the use of heat.
Note that some fish, like ahi and salmon, will not turn white upon being cooked, even though they will become opaque. For these types of fish, you may need to poke the fish with a fork to see if it flakes.

, Stir, and allow all the ingredients to sit for another 30 minutes. Do not add these vegetables into the lime juice at the start of the process, however, since the acid in the lime juice may break them down too much and make them mushy by the time you serve the ceviche.

Prepare a marinade for meat, poultry, or fish with lime juice.,
Use lime juice instead of lemon juice for marinades that sit over an extended amount of time.,
Do not allow meats, poultry, and fish to marinate too long.",How to Cook With Lime Juice2," Every marinade is made up of an acid, an oil, and flavorings. The oil moistens the meat while spices and herbs seep in, adding pronounced flavor. The acid breaks the meat down, allowing the oil and seasonings to do their job. Vinegar and lemon juice are the most common acids used, but lime juice is also acidic enough to do the trick. Lime juice goes especially well with chicken and fish.


The simplest marinades use equal parts oil and acid. For most marinades, you will need to prepare 1/2 cup per pound (125 milliliters per 450 grams) of meat, or 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) lime juice and 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) olive oil per pound.

, While it has enough acid to break down meat, lime juice is slightly less acidic than lemon juice, so the reaction goes a little slower. As a result, meats that bathe in lime juice can sit a little while longer without turning tough.

, The acidic lime juice can actually begin ""cooking"" the meat, as it does when used for ceviche. Due to the oil, however, the cooking process will not be as thorough, leaving you with raw meat that turns tough upon cooking it with heat.


Marinate pork and beef for 2 hours to allow them ample time to soak in the marinade. Large, dense cuts can last up to 1 or 2 days before turning tough.
Marinate chicken for about 1 hour. Chicken and other types of poultry are less dense than pork or beef, so marinades have a stronger effect. Do not allow chicken to marinate for much longer than 8 to 10 hours.
Marinate seafood for 30 minutes. Fish has a remarkably light density and acidic lime juice will have a strong effect on it early on. Do not allow fish to marinate for more than 60 minutes, or it will begin ""cooking"" and will end up with a tough, unpleasant texture once you continue cooking it with heat.

Make a key lime dessert.,
Flavor a beverage with lime juice.,
Add lime juice to your favorite sauce.,
Create a lime juice dressing.,
Make a guacamole dip.",How to Cook With Lime Juice3," Lime juice is most commonly used in cuisine from Mexico, Latin America, Hawaii, and other island countries. You can search for recipes from these regions to make use of your lime juice, or you could add a splash of lime juice in toward the end of your cooking to flavor otherwise bland dishes like soups or pastas.

, Cilantro is an especially common herb to use with lime juice. Coconut is another worthwhile flavor to match with lime juice and brings a nice node of sweetness to the sourness of lime.

, Rice absorbs flavor as it cooks, so adding 1 or 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of lime juice can give it a tangy, exotic flavor. The citrus in lime also makes rice fluffier, but the effect is not as pronounced as it is when using a stronger citrus like lemon juice.


Alternatively, you can also create coconut lime rice by substituting half or all of the water for coconut milk and adding 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of lime juice. This rice will be heavy rather than fluffy due to the effect of the coconut milk.

, Key limes are smaller than other lime varieties and have a sharper, more pronounced sourness that creates an interesting contrast in otherwise sweet desserts. Key lime pie is the most common lime baked good, but you can also create cakes, cheesecakes, ice cream, and more using the juice of key limes.

, While not as commonly used as lemon juice, lime juice can add a refreshing splash of citrus to a variety of drinks. One or two teaspoons of lime juice works especially well in water, but you can also try adding a splash to a lemon-lime drink or other soda. Alternatively, you can use lime juice to create limeade.

, Lime juice can give an old sauce recipe new dimension. Try adding 1 or 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 milliliters) of lime juice to a standard barbecue or marinara sauce. Stir the lime juice in and warm the sauce so that the flavors can blend.

, A simple vinaigrette dressing combines olive oil and vinegar in a ratio of 3 to 1. For an exotic twist, you can skip the vinegar and add lime juice in the same proportions. Mix in a little honey to cut the sourness of the lime juice, or add some cilantro, ginger, and salt to enhance the flavor. You can use this dressing over cold cooked pasta, loose leaf salads, and cucumber salads.

, Authentic guacamole tends to use lime juice, since the flavor of the avocado pulp is enhanced by the tanginess of lime. Other ingredients, like cilantro, salt, and garlic, are added in and blended together to create a slightly chunky dip."

Use lemon juice to marinate meat, poultry, and fish.,
Make sure to choose spices and herbs that complement the taste of lemon.,
Marinate beef and pork for two hours to maximize the amount of flavor the meat picks up from the marinade.,
Allow poultry to marinate for 30 minutes to about four or five hours.,
Do not marinate fish any longer than 60 minutes.",How to Cook With Lemon Juice1," Every marinade is made of three key components: acid, oil, and flavorings. The oil moistens the meat while spices and herbs add flavor. The acid makes it all possible by breaking down the raw meat, thereby permitting the oil and spices to have an effect. Many marinades use vinegar for the acid, but lemon juice is just as effective and lends a citrus flavor.


Use anywhere from 1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup (15 to 60 milliliters) lemon juice for marinades, depending on how much meat you use, how tender you want it to be, and how strong you want the lemon flavor to be.;
, If you are not sure which ones to try, consider trying black pepper, garlic, dill, or parsley.

, These meats are the densest, so the lemon juice has more the break down than it does in poultry or fish. Smaller chunks of beef and pork can pick up flavor from a marinade in 45 minutes or so, while roasts and large cuts can withstand marinating for up to two days.

, Chicken is less dense than beef and pork, and it can usually pick up flavor within the first 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the size of the cut. You can marinate chicken for several hours without negatively affecting the texture, but while it is technically safe to allow chicken to marinate for up to two days, allowing it to sit this long will turn the texture tough and chewy.

, Fish and other types of seafood have a very light density, and the acidic lemon juice can actually ""cook"" the fish if it seeps in for more than an hour. For most dishes, marinating for 30 minutes is ideal.

, But sometimes when you open the can, some of the liquid may occasionally spurt out and can be messy, so cover the can over with a cloth when opening. They are sterile because canned food was originally invented for British soldiers in the Boer War and was meant to be eaten straight from the can.

, You could boil the water first and then place the can in, but you need to be sure that the insertion of the can will not cause the boiled water to overflow. You may prefer to put the can into the cold water first and bring it to boil along with the water.

, You will find that the label on the can will be coming off and if it is, it is a good idea to take the can out and remove the label completely.

, Bring it to the boil once more, switch it off and give another 5-10 minutes before opening the can, the contents of which it is guaranteed will be piping hot.

, Of course, while you are waiting for the vegetables to cook, the can is cooling, but the canned food is usually still warm.

, You can boil milk in a glass jar, for instance. Sometimes the jar might break if the glass is thick, but that usually only happens if you plunge the cold jar straight into boiling water. This happens with thick glass, if the outside experiences more heat expansion than the inside. But if it is allowed to heat gradually, then it will heat up evenly. You can cook good scrambled eggs in a jar as well, and boiled eggs can be put straight into the kettle.

Lightly place the steak in the pan and begin to fry.,
Decide whether you're going to flip the meat often or only once.,
Cook the steak for anywhere from 3 to 6 minutes per side, depending on thickness and desired doneness.,
About 2 minutes before steak is ready, add 2 tablespoons of butter into the pan, along with any herbs or aromatics.,
Use a thermometer to test doneness.,
About 5° F (3° C) before your steak is done, remove it from the pan and set it aside to cool.,
Serve your steak and enjoy.",How to Cook Steak in a Frying Pan," Thick cuts of steak (1 in/2.5 cm or more) can develop a beautiful outer crust without drying out the insides unnecessarily. This task is a lot more difficult with thin cuts: You risk overcooking the inside right when the outside has finished browning. If you like your steak to have a perfectly-brown outside and a juicy, pink center, opt for thicker cuts of meat over thinner ones. Ensure the steak is defrosted first, an icy steak won't season or sear properly.


;
, Salt at least 40 minutes in advance of frying. Salting too soon before cooking does the exact opposite of what you want to do: It brings the moisture out to the surface. When you salt far enough in advance that process can reverse:





The salt draws the moisture out to the surface, where it settles in small puddles. Meanwhile the salt is tenderizing the meat and breaking down proteins. After this quick tenderization happens, the moisture drawn out by the salt begins to seep back in to the steak. This leaves your steak both more tender and more moist.Do not apply pepper just yet. Pepper can burn during the pan frying, while salt cannot. If you don't want the acrid taste of pepper on your beautiful steak, hold off until just after you've finished frying the steak.

, Wait until the oil just starts to smoke. This means that the pan is ready to take the steak.




, If the pan has raised ridges, you can set your steak in at an angle in order to give it a crosshatch pattern.




, To flip or not to flip — that is the question. While many cooks choose to flip the steak only once to develop full color on each side, many food scientists have recently begun to weigh in on the question, and their findings point to a different answer.





The frequent flipping club has discovered that food that is flipped often cooks faster and more evenly.On the flip side, the meat doesn't have enough time to develop the best possible charring, although it still develops plenty of flavor.
Try it out for yourself and see which method produces the best steak for you. Cooking is all about suiting your own preferences. Those preferences should speak loudest.

, A thicker cut will obviously require longer cooking, while a thinner cut will get cooked quicker.




, The butter will give the steak a rich, nutty flavor. Tilt the pan slightly and spoon the melted butter on top of the steak for even coverage. If you want to add any herbs or aromatics to your steak — although a good steak will not need them — consider adding any one of the following:





Rosemary
Lavender
Thyme
Sage
Garlic

, A thermometer is your best bet for producing a great-tasting steak consistently each time. (Alternately, you can use the finger test.) A handy electronic thermometer will only pierce the surface of the skin lightly and should be able to tell you if your steak is nearing the desired doneness. For a guide on what temperature you want to cook your steak to, study the following chart:





120° F (48.8° C) = Rare
130° F (54.4° C) = Medium rare
140° F (60° C) = Medium
150° F (65.5° C) = Medium well
160° F (71.1° C) = Well done

, Your steak will continue cooking somewhat even after you remove it from the pan. This is why you remove it before it's actually finished cooking. And, of course, let your steak rest for at least five minutes by covering it with a tent of aluminum foil.





If you don't let your steak rest properly, all the juices will spill out when you cut into it. That's because the muscle fibers tighten up during cooking, sending the juices to the center of the cut, where the meat is still relatively rare and light. Resting the meat allows the muscle fibers to relax, sending the juices back through the entire piece of meat. Then, when you cut it up, your steak is both more tender and more juicy.

, You can either cut your steak into relatively thick slices or let your guests tuck into it on their own.

, Fresh cut fruit discolors due to a process called oxidation. The vitamin C or ascorbic acid found in lemon juice chemically reacts with the oxygen in the air to prevent fruits from oxidizing. Brushing your cut fruits with a little lemon juice will maintain their color for much longer.


You can also dip the cut fruit into a mixture made with 1 cup (250 milliliters) of water and 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of lemon juice to accomplish the same task.







, Like fresh fruits, fresh vegetables are also prone to oxidation. As a result, their colors dull. Squeeze a little lemon juice over your fresh vegetables and toss to mix in order to keep the colors bright.

, A simple dressing, known as vinaigrette, uses vinegar and olive oil. Instead of using vinegar, however, you can use lemon juice for an extra tangy taste. Try combining 1/4 cup olive oil with about 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of lemon juice to start. You can use more lemon juice for a stronger taste, or you can cut back on the sourness by mixing in 1 teaspoon (4.8 grams) of sugar or honey. You can also enhance the taste of the dressing by adding salt and pepper to taste, or other herbs and spices.


Aside from standard green salads, you can use a lemon juice dressing to coat cooked vegetables, cold cooked pasta, and more.
For tossed salads, you may want to consider drizzling the oil and lemon juice over the salad separately. You can also combine the two into a single dressing, but combining them can cause leafy salads to get damp quickly if the dressing is used in abundance.

, Boil the rice in water and squeeze in 1 teaspoon to 3 tablespoons (5 to 45 milliliters) of lemon juice. If you want the fluffiness lemon juice provides while minimizing the amount of lemon taste that comes through, stick with 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) of juice. The more juice you use, the stronger the flavor will be.

, Salt preserves and flavors food. A little is a good thing, but a lot can have harmful side effects to your health. Lemon juice also preserves and flavors, so as long as the juice complements the other flavors in your dish, lemon juice can be a healthier choice than salt.

, Many sauces made with lemon juice involve butter. Hollandaise sauce, for instance, uses egg yolks, butter, and lemon juice. It is also flavored with a little salt and white or cayenne pepper, and the sauce is typically used with eggs Benedict and steamed vegetables.


A lemon juice sauce can also improve your digestive health. Lemon juice is an especially helpful aid in the digestion of fried foods.







, If you only want the lemon juice for its acidic properties, this is not necessary, since the acids will continue to work throughout the entire process. If you want to enhance the lemon taste, however, adding your lemon juice in at the end of the cooking time will prevent a loss of flavor.

Season before serving.",How to Cook Vegetables1," Steaming is among the best ways to cook vegetables while preserving as many vitamins and nutrients as possible. You can steam just about any vegetable, and all you need is a steamer or steamer basket that fits in a saucepan.


Wash your vegetables by rubbing them under clean water. Scrub tougher vegetables, like carrots, with a vegetable brush.
Cut off any stems, and peel vegetables with thick or inedible skins, such as onion.
Cut the vegetables into bite-sized pieces.
Some of the best vegetables to cook by steaming include carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, green beans, spinach, Brussel sprouts, potatoes, kale, turnip, zucchini, and bok choy.;
, If you're using a special steaming device, add enough water to reach the fill line on the steamer. If you're using a saucepan with a steamer basket, add about an inch (2.5 cm) of water to the bottom of a large saucepan.


If you don’t have a steamer basket, use a heat-proof colander instead.

, Place your vegetables into the steamer basket, and place the basket into the steamer or the saucepan. Put on the lid, as this will help keep the steam in.When you put the steamer basket into the saucepan, make sure the vegetables aren't touching the water directly. If they are, pour out some of the water.

, Heat your saucepan over medium heat or turn on your steamer. As the water boils, the steam will cook and soften the vegetables. Cooking time depends on personal preference and the type of vegetable. You can check if the vegetables are done by piercing them with a fork. If the fork goes in easily and without resistance, the vegetables are done.


For smaller or crunchier vegetables, cook for three to five minutes. This includes celery, greens, peas, and leeks.
For denser or softer vegetables, cook for 10 to 20 minutes. This includes Brussel sprouts, beans, broccoli, and potatoes.
For large and very dense vegetables, cook for 25 to 40 minutes. This includes artichokes and beets.

, When the vegetables are cooked to your liking, remove them from the steamer basket and transfer them to a bowl. Season with salt, pepper, fresh or dried herbs and spices, or fresh lemon juice, to taste. Popular herbs for vegetables include:


Thyme
Oregano
Rosemary
Tarragon
Lemongrass

Use any summer squash variety for a recipe.,
Use small, firm squash.,
Store summer squash in the refrigerator and use them quickly.,
Rinse squash with clean water, right before you use them.,
Remove the seeds, if desired.,
Slice or chop squash however you want.",How to Cook Summer Squash1," While the familiar zucchini and yellow summer squash are probably the most common, there are literally hundreds of hybrids and varieties of summer squash available at farmers markets and in gardens. The good news? While the texture and flavors differ very subtly, you can use almost all of them interchangeably. The only thing that differs is the dicing. For all the steps and recipes throughout the article, any of the following squash would be perfect:


Zucchini
Yellow crook-neck or straight-neck
Marrow squash
Scallop squash
Pattison squash, sometimes called ""spaceship"" or ""UFO"" squash
Caserta squash
Lemon squash;
, The best summer squash are bought locally and used as soon as possible after picking. When you're picking squash at the market, pick out the smallest and the firmest. Check at the stem and flower end of the squash for signs of wrinkling, which can be a sign that the squash is somewhat old.


Squash that are larger or overgrown are often mealy, but they're perfect for baking. Pro tip: scour the farmer's market right before it closes. Nobody wants to have to take those baseball-bat sized zucchinis back home. You might score them for super-cheap, and have the makings of some zucchini muffins.

, Summer squash respirate more quickly than some other vegetables, which means they expel more spoilage-promoting carbon dioxide.Point being, wrap them up and stick them in the fridge to keep them fresh, where they should be fine for 5-7 days.


Store squash in a storage bag, wrapping them tightly to keep the air out of the bag. The more the squash respirate, the more nutritional value and flavor they'll lose.

, Summer squash, whether you got them at the store or picked them from your own garden, should be rinsed gently with cold water just before using, to remove any dirt particles, or pesticides from the outer skin. Scrub very gently with a vegetable brush, if desired.


Don't rinse your squash after bringing them inside, if you don't plan on using them right away. This will promote spoilage.

, While it's perfectly fine to eat every part of a summer squash, seeds included, the seed section of some squash can get a little mealy when raw, which will be slimy when cooked, especially if the squash is slightly overgrown. It's also essential if you plan to stuff the squash with anything. If you want to remove the seeds:


Cut the squash down the center, length-wise, and scoop out the seeds with a spoon, removing the soft and jelly-like center area along with it.

, Start by removing the stem end and the flower end of the squash, then cutting up the squash however you choose. Slicing squash into discs, chopping it into even cubes, cutting it into strips, grating squash, or roasting it whole: there's really no wrong way to cut up a summer squash, and a lot of it will depend on the shape and the variety.


Leave the skin on summer squash. Unlike winter varieties, the skin of summer squash is one of the most edible and flavorsome parts of the squash. There's no need to remove it, unless you don't want it there for cosmetic reasons.
Remove some of the moisture from the squash by salting it gently before you cook with it. This will bring some of the water to the surface, which you can rinse off by running the sliced squash under the water once more. While this isn't necessary, it's a process called ""disgorging,"" and is effective at keeping squash dishes, and especially baking, from getting too watery."

Measure out rice and water.,
Lock the cooker.,
Bring your pressure up.,
Release the pressure.,
Open lid and fluff the rice.",How to Cook Rice in Pressure Cooker1," Pour your desired measurement of rice into your pressure cooker. Add water according to the type and quantity of rice you are using. One cup of white rice, for instance, needs 1.5 cups of water.Substitute all or part of the water with a liquid for flavoring if you wish, such as chicken broth, vegetable broth, or prepared bouillion.
Never fill the pressure cooker more than halfway with the rice and liquid.
Add a teaspoon of butter, olive oil, or an oil of your choice to the rice for flavor if you like.;
, Close and lock the lid on your pressure cooker by fastening the handle of the cover to the handle for the body of the pot, or however your model is intended to close according to the instruction manual. Place the cooker on a burner of your stove.


If you are using an electric pressure cooker, plug it into an outlet and turn it on.

, Set the burner on your stove to high heat until your pressure cooker indicates high pressure, then lower the heat to maintain this pressure for three minutes. Check your specific instruction manual for how to properly read the pressure on your cooker.


If you are using an electric pressure cooker, set it to high pressure for three minutes. The cooker will take a few minutes to pressure up before the three minutes of cooking time.Lower the heat right away after your cooker reaches high pressure, otherwise your rice can become quickly overcooked., When the three minutes cooking time is up, take the pressure cooker off the burner for a 10-minute natural pressure release, meaning the pressure built up inside releases naturally when taken off of heat. The rice will continue to cook while the pressure is slowly released.


For an electric cooker, turn it off when the timer beeps and set it to a natural pressure release for 10 minutes., After 10 minutes of natural release, do a quick release on your pressure cooker to open the lid. Tilt the cooker away from you when opening the lid to avoid the hot steam.Fluff the rice with a fork and serve.

Wash and cut your vegetables.,
Marinate the veggies.,
Heat the grill.,
Place the vegetables on the grill.,
Remove the veggies from the grill before serving.",How to Cook Vegetables2," Grilling is a great cooking method for lots of vegetables, and popular ones include onion, mushrooms, zucchini, eggplant, squash, asparagus, peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, and corn.


Wash and scrub your vegetables. Remove any stems, skins, or woody parts.
Asparagus, mushrooms, corn, and small peppers can be left whole.
Cut onions, zucchini, eggplant, and squash into 0.5-inch (1.25-cm) disks.

, In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, lemon juice, herbs, and garlic. Place your vegetables into a sealable plastic bag or a glass bowl, and pour the marinade over the veggies.Stir to combine, or close the bag and shake the veggies around to coat them in the marinade.
Set aside and let the vegetables marinate for at least an hour.

, When you're ready to cook your vegetables, heat your grill to medium. If you're using a charcoal grill, get the coals nice and hot, and then let them burn until you have a large base of embers.


Once the grill is preheated, you can cook the veggies.

, Larger vegetables can be laid out directly on the grill. Make sure to spread them out so they aren't overlapping, and let the excess marinade drip off before placing them on the grill. Smaller vegetables can go on the grill in a basket, on skewers, or wrapped in foil.Thinner and less dense vegetables will take about three to five minutes to cook. Larger and denser vegetables will take about eight to ten minutes. Use tongs or a metal spatula to flip the vegetables halfway through cooking.Root vegetables like potatoes and carrots should be cooked in foil to prevent them from burning on the outside and not cooking on the inside.

, Using tongs or the spatula, remove the vegetables from the grill and place them on individual plates or a large serving platter.


Season the veggies with additional herbs and spices before serving if desired.

Boil your veggies.,
Use the microwave.,
Sauté or stir fry.,
Roast vegetables.,
Braise them.,
Fry your vegetables.",How to Cook Vegetables3," Boiling vegetables is a quick and easy way to cook veggies, but it’s important to remember that boiling removes a lot of nutrients and vitamins from food. To preserve as many of those nutrients as possible, you should:


Boil vegetables at a simmer, rather than a full boil
Save the water you boil the veggies in and use it for other things, such as making rice or soups, Microwaving vegetables is actually a great way to cook them and preserve a lot of the nutrients, because microwaving cooks food so quickly. To cook veggies in the microwave:


Rinse your veggies under running water and scrub tougher ones with a vegetable brush. Top and tail vegetables with stems or tips.
Cut the vegetables into bite-sized pieces, or one-inch (2.5-cm) cubes. Place the veggies into a microwave safe dish, such as a glass bowl.
Cover the bowl tightly with a lid or plastic wrap. Place the veggies on the rotating plate and microwave on high for between 4.5 minutes (for one pound of veggies) and 9 minutes (for two pounds).
Remove one corner of the lid or puncture a few holes in the plastic to allow steam to escape before serving., Sautéing is a versatile cooking technique that you can use for lots of different ingredients, and you can make a stir fry using just about any combination of vegetables and proteins you like.


When you stir fry vegetables, you can use a wide variety of oils (such as peanut, sesame, or canola), and you can add fresh herbs, dried spices, or different sauces to change the look and taste of the dish., After you clean your vegetables, place them in your bowl and drizzle them with olive oil and any desired seasoning like salt or onion or garlic powder. Lightly toss to mix. Place the vegetables in a single layer in your shallow baking dish. Cook in a 350 F (177 C) oven until the vegetables are tender. Roasting works best with whole vegetables or large chunks and thick slices.

, Braising is a cooking method that combines both steaming and boiling, so you end up with perfectly cooked food that hasn’t lost as many nutrients as it does when it’s boiled.


They key to braising is cooking with a lid on, so that the steam from the water cooks the vegetables instead of escaping into the air.
To add flavor when braising, you can add herbs, spices, citrus, or other flavors to the pan as well., Deep frying food may not be the healthiest cooking method because of the amount of oil used, but deep fried veggies are still a wonderful treat from time to time.


If you don’t want to deep fry your veggies, only add enough oil to the pan to have a half-inch (1.25 cm) of oil in the pan. Make sure you flip the veggies at least once to cook both sides.

Slice squash into chunks or discs.,
Heat olive oil in a skillet on medium-high.,
Add minced garlic or other additions, if desired.,
Cook squash 4-5 minutes on each side.,
Toss with soy sauce, or salt and pepper.,
Top with chopped parsley or cilantro.",How to Cook Summer Squash2," One of the most elegant and delicious ways of cooking summer squash is to use it as a quick and easy side dish, stir-frying it and dressing it simply. This makes an excellent side for grilled meats or rice dishes, and is perfectly amenable to any seasonings, additions, or changes you might want to make.


Probably the most common way of preparing squash for this dish would be to cut it into disc-shaped slices, then fry them on both sides. They'll cook relatively quickly.
If you're cooking this as a side for a big group, aim for about one small-medium squash for each person.

, Add a few teaspoons of olive oil to a skillet when the pan starts to get hot and coat the bottom of the pan evenly. Add the squash in an even layer before the oil starts to smoke.


The best way to stir fry summer squash is pretty quickly, at relatively high heat. If you cook squash lower and slower, they'll get pretty watery and limp.

, A quick and simple way of flavoring the squash is to add a little bit of minced garlic, which will soften quickly. Toss the squash with the garlic to coat it evenly. Summer squash isn't super-flavorsome, so it's usually a good idea to add something. Any of the following make good additions to a squash stir-fry:


Sweet corn
Bell pepper
White or green onion
Kale
Chard
Collards
Fried tofu
Chicken or beef

, When the outside of the squash starts to brown, turn it over, then turn the heat down gently, to medium. Depending on how thickly you've sliced the squash, they'll cook in anywhere between 10 and 15 minutes, and will be done when fork tender, to the desired softness.It's very easy to overcook summer squash, and not really possible to undercook them. Raw summer squash is commonly eaten, and though it can leave a kind of drying sensation in your mouth and in the back of your throat, there's no reason to worry about under-doing it.

, When the squash are done cooking, remove them into a serving bowl and add a splash of soy sauce to dress them, or add some salt and black pepper, tossing the squash to coat them evenly.


Season the squash however you like. If you're making some curry to go with it, add a pinch of garam masala. If you're making burgers, add a pinch of cayenne. Other good seasonings for cooked squash include balsamic vinegar, hoisin sauce, or Sriracha.
If you already disgorged the squash to draw water out, be very careful about adding additional salt. Taste it first and add more if necessary.

, A bunch of chopped parsley or cilantro really helps to lift the flavor of the squash and give it a freshness and vibrancy. Top the squash with chopped vegetables and serve immediately.

Cut squash in half length-wise and remove the seeds.,
Stuff the inside with meat and cheese of your choice.,
Wrap the squash in aluminum foil, or place on the grill.,
Grill stuffed squash boats over medium heat.,
Grill with the lid on for 10-15 minutes.",How to Cook Summer Squash3," Remove the stem and flower end of the squash, then cut them in half long-ways and scoop out the seeds to prepare your ""boats."" Make 1-2 medium squash per person.


If you don't want to stuff the squash, but want to grill them, you can also cut squash into discs, or leave it whole to toss it on the grill. The basic cooking method will be the same.

, Once you've scooped out the seedy portion of the squash, you can fill in the inside with a variety of stuffing ingredients, including cooked meats, other vegetables, and cheeses. If you don't want to stuff it with anything, you an also just dress it in salt and pepper and call it a day. Some good combinations include:


Browned ground beef, green peppers, onions, and cheddar or American cheese
Browned lamb, sliced black olives, tomato, green onions, and feta
Chicken, jalapeno peppers, salsa, pepper jack

, There are two ways of cooking squash on the grill, both equally effective. If you want to make sure the squash are heated through and cooked on the bottoms, it's good to wrap them in aluminum foil loosely and place the package on the grill. Group a couple of them together to use a tight little grill package.


If you want, put the other half of the squash back on the ""boat"" before you close it up in aluminum foil, to make a full stuffed squash (good if you overload it with fixings!) or you can use every half for a separate boat, depending on how much you need to make.
If you choose to use each half for a separate boat, it's usually easier to place the squash directly on the grill, instead of in aluminum foil, to keep the insides from spilling or sticking to the sides.

, If you're using an electric grill, set the heat to medium. If you're using a charcoal grill, use a medium amount of coals, spread to one side of the grill basin, and put the package in the middle of the grate, rotating it a few times to ensure an evening cooking distribution.

, As long as everything inside the squash boats are cooked ahead of time, you've only got to worry about melting cheese, heating the inside through, and cooking the squash itself, which shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Rotate the squash a few times to ensure an even cook, but otherwise leave them alone.


Always put the lid back on when you're cooking squash, to ensure that the heat cooks the insides, as well as the bottom. Check the packages or the squash directly every five minutes or so to check for doneness.
If you put them in a package, the squash will be done when the package is steaming and smells fragrant, and the squash is fork-tender. Open up a package carefully and check one to be sure.

Add the grated squash.,
Add four cups of water or chicken stock.,
Bring the soup to boiling, then reduce heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer.,
Temper the soup with egg and lemon.,
Season the soup liberally.,
Top with fresh chopped parsley and grated parmesan.",How to Cook Summer Squash4," Everyone loves winter squash soup, but a surprising, simple, and elegant late-summer soup can be a perfect way to use up some lingering summer squash you may have. It's a great way of using up as many summer squash as you want, and is perfectly for one of those mid-September cold snaps. This recipe calls for 4-6 small-medium squash, grated coarsely, and serves 3-4 people.


Use a box grater or a plane grater after trimming off the ends of the squash. Run the squash through the coarsest setting. If you want the squash more fine, run it through whichever setting you wish.
Salt and squeeze the grated squash to remove some of the water, and rinse it thoroughly in a colander. Squeeze the rest of the water out of it and prepare the rest of the vegetables.

, There's plenty of room to add whatever vegetables you like to this dish, or you can just go with a simpler squash-and-rice version if you're not a veggie-head. You've really got to try it with the following additions, though:


One inch of grated ginger
2 medium carrots, peeled and chopped
One small-medium white onion, chopped
3-4 cloves of garlic, minced
One bunch of chopped Italian flat-leaf parsley
Browned sausage or bacon (optional)

, Start in a pot big enough for a sizable pot of soup, and sauté the onions, garlic, carrots, and ginger until the onions become translucent. This should take 5-7 minutes.


If you want to add sausage, bacon, or other meats to this recipe, cook the meat in the bottom of the pan first, remove it from the pot, and return it back in 5-10 minutes before its done cooking.

, Measure out some jasmine rice, rinse it in clean water to remove dust and sediment from the grains, and add the rice directly into the onion mixture at the bottom of the pot, and stir it for 1-2 minutes, until the rice becomes fragrant.


You don't have to ""toast"" the rice, so this step only takes a very short amount of time. Warming the jasmine helps to bring out some of the flavors.
If you don't have jasmine rice, plain white rice, short grain brown rice, or any variety would be perfectly fine as a substitution. Use what you like.

, As soon as the rice becomes fragrant, add the squash to keep it from browning or burning. Stir the squash quickly to coat everything in the mixture, and keep stirring it for a minute or two to coat it thoroughly.

, Depending on how big your squash are, and how big a pot of soup you want to make, you can mess around with this amount. Read the directions on the rice you have to make sure you've got enough water to cook the rice to doneness, plus two cups. You can add water if necessary.

, The rice should take approximately 20-30 minutes to cook, which should be the perfect amount of time for bringing the flavors together. It's usually best to cook with the lid on the pot, slightly askew, and to lower the temperature so it's at a gentle simmer, just barely boiling.

, When the rice appears done, beat two eggs into a heat-resistant bowl with the juice of one lemon, then temper the egg mixture and add it to the soup to thicken it.


Stirring the egg and lemon vigorously, add small spoonfuls of the broth from the soup, very slowly, to bring the temperature up and cook the egg without curdling it. Go slowly and keep stirring. When the egg mixture is steaming in the bowl, it's done, and you can pour it into the soup pot, while stirring it in. This will thicken and flavor the soup.
If the idea of tempering eggs grosses you out, or if you'd rather not have them, add the lemon juice directly into the soup and thicken the soup with cornstarch or flour, if desired.

, It's important to wait to season the soup until after you've tempered it. Very salty broth can curdle eggs more quickly, rather than tempering them. Perfectly edible of course, just not quite the texture you're looking for. Season this soup with salt and black pepper.


If you want, a little cayenne also goes nicely with this basic recipe, and you can season it however you prefer.

, After tempering the soup, remove the lid and let it continue cooking gently for 5 or 10 minutes, just to let the flavors come together. Taste it to check for salt and serve with fresh chopped parsley and grated parmesan cheese on top. Serve with a lemon wedge.

Put your desired amount of rice into the bowl, and the correct amount of water for the quantity and type of rice (one cup of white rice, for instance, needs 1.5 cups of water).Choose a stainless steel bowl for ideal cooking, as it will conduct heat better than glass or ceramics.
Substitute all or part of the water with a liquid for flavoring if you wish, such as chicken broth, vegetable broth, or prepared bouillion.
Add a teaspoon of butter, olive oil, or an oil of your choice to the rice for flavor if you like.

, Lower the bowl with your rice and liquid into the pressure cooker so it sits on your steaming basket or trivet. Don’t cover your bowl with anything. Then close and lock the lid of your cooker.


Check the instruction manual for your pressure cooker to ensure that you are closing and locking the lid properly.

, Set the burner on your stove to high heat until your pressure cooker indicates high pressure, then lower the heat to maintain this pressure for three minutes. Check your specific instruction manual for how to properly read the pressure on your cooker.


If you are using an electric pressure cooker, set it to high pressure for three minutes. The cooker will take a few minutes to pressure up before the three minutes of cooking time., When the three minutes cooking time is up, take the pressure cooker off the burner for a 10-minute natural pressure release, meaning the pressure built up inside releases naturally when taken off of heat. The rice will continue to cook while the pressure is slowly released.


For an electric cooker, turn it off when the timer beeps and set it to a natural pressure release for 10 minutes.Lower the heat right away after your cooker reaches high pressure, otherwise your rice can become quickly overcooked., After 10 minutes of natural release, do a quick release on your pressure cooker to open the lid. Tilt the cooker away from you when opening the lid to avoid the hot steam.Carefully remove your bowl or pot and fluff the rice with a fork before serving.

Wash the rutabaga.,
Peel the rutabaga.,
Chop the rutabaga into small chunks.,
Boil the rutabaga.,
Drain and mash the rutabaga.,
Season before serving.",How to Cook Rutabaga1," Rinse the rutabaga under cool water and scrub the skin with a vegetable brush. This will remove any excess dirt from the surface of the vegetable.Pat the rutabaga dry with a clean towel or paper towel.

Make sure that the rutabaga is completely dry to prevent an accident when you're peeling and chopping.;
, Carefully slice off the top and bottom stems from the rutabaga. Trim about ½ inch (1.3 cm) off the top and bottom. Stand the rutabaga on the top end and cut it in half. Use a paring knife to carefully peel off the top layer of skin.

Vegetable peelers aren't always effective for rutabaga, which has a skin that’s often covered in a thick waxy coating., Use a kitchen knife and cut the peeled halves into 1-inch (2.5-cm) chunks. This will help the rutabaga to cook faster. Cut all the chunks to the same size and thickness to ensure even cooking.

, Transfer the chunks to a large stockpot and cover the rutabaga with water. Add an extra inch or two (2.5 to 5 cm) of water to ensure the rutabaga is completely covered. Put on a lid and heat the rutabaga over medium-high heat. When the water comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer for another 30 to 40 minutes.The rutabaga is ready when a fork can easily pierce the flesh.

, When the rutabaga is cooked through, pour the contents of the stockpot through a colander to drain the water. Return the rutabaga to the pot. Add the butter and nutmeg. Use a potato masher, hand mixer, or fork to mash the rutabaga until it’s smooth.

You can leave some small chunks of rutabaga in the mash if you like, or puree it until it’s completely smooth and free of chunks.
For an extra creamy mash, add a dollop of sour cream to the rutabaga as well.

, Add salt and pepper, to taste, and stir the seasonings into the mash. You can also add fresh or dried herbs, such as dill, oregano, or rosemary, or other seasonings like minced garlic.Serve the mashed rutabaga while it’s still hot, either on its own or as a side dish with roast beef, duck, or stir fry."

Make ratatouille.,
Make summer squash rice.,
Make a raw summer squash salad.,
Make squash fritters.",How to Cook Summer Squash5," A classic of French cooking, ratatouille uses summer squash and the related eggplant as a centerpiece of simplicity. Its late-summer cuisine at its finest, and it's pretty easy to make with fresh vegetables.


In a pot, sauté a diced green, yellow, and orange pepper, in olive oil, adding two cloves of minced garlic, a half cup of diced onion, and three diced tomatoes. Season with thyme, bay leaf, and kosher salt. Remove from heat when the tomatoes are broken down and the mixture has the consistency of a sauce.
Spoon the tomato mixture into the bottom of a cast-iron skillet, a dutch oven, or another baking-ready cooking vessel. Set the oven to 275, and top the tomato mixture in the skillet with 3-4 various summer squash, sliced into rounds, and one smallish eggplant, sliced into rounds, and top it with 3-4 cloves of minced garlic, salt, pepper, and olive oil.
Cover the skillet with foil, roasting for about two hours, then remove the foil and bake it for 30 minutes more. Sprinkle some balsamic vinegar and fresh chopped herbs over the top to serve.

, Integrating some grated squash into a rice dish can be an excellent way to spice up plain-old rice, either as a side or as a centerpiece dish. This recipe goes incredibly well with any type of curry or Indian dish.


Coarsely grate two small-medium summer squash, and sauté gently at the bottom of a pot with onions and garlic. Season with one tablespoon each of cumin and coriander powder, and a 1/4 teaspoon of turmeric. Stir.
Add a cup of jasmine rice to pot and stir until fragrant. Add 2 1/2 cups of water, bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat to low. The rice should be done in 30-40 minutes.
Serve topped with chopped cilantro, raisins, and sliced almonds.

, Summer squash is perfectly tasty when eaten raw, and this cold salad is perfect as a side dish for hot summer days, or even as a topping for burgers or hot dogs. It has a consistency and taste a bit like cole slaw.


Grate three or four small-medium squash, and mix in a bowl with one medium grated carrot, half a red onion, sliced finely, some minced bell pepper, a minced clove of garlic, a sprinkling of sunflower seeds, and a bunch of chopped parsley.
Dress the salad with two tablespoons of good olive oil, a tablespoon or so of balsamic vinegar, the juice of half a lemon, and salt and pepper to taste.
If you'd prefer, you could also dress the salad in any commercial bottled salad dressing you like.

, Squash fritters are bit like potato pancakes, but with a slightly different texture, and more colorful to boot. These are great topped with applesauce, tomato sauce, coleslaw, or just eaten solo. This recipe yields about 20 fritters.


Grate, salt, and squeeze 4-5 small or medium squash, rinsing them thoroughly to get the water out. Grate half a medium white onion, as well, and mix with the squash in a bowl, adding a cup of white flour, one half teaspoon each of salt and sugar, and an egg. Mix thoroughly.

Make gourmet sandwiches with added chips.,
Whip up a crunchy breaded chicken meal with potato chip crust.,
Make potato chip meatballs.",How to Cook with Leftover Potato Chips2," Potato chips can add a savory crunch to just about any sandwich. Try combining several slices of your preferred deli meat, a slice or two of cheese, some dill pickle slices, sliced tomatoes, and two teaspoons of mayonnaise on wheat bread. Stack some potato chips across the top before you add the final piece of bread.Potato chips taste great with almost any savory sandwich, especially when combined with dill pickles.

, Crush 4  c (950 mL) of potato chips in a large mixing bowl and add one tablespoon of parsley flakes. In a separate bowl, beat one large egg and add two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce. Clean four boneless skinless chicken breasts and soak them in the egg mixture until they are fully coated. Then coat each chicken breast in the potato chip mixture.

Use potato chips instead of bread crumbs.,
Make blue cheese potato chips.,
Spice up your green beans au gratin with chips.",How to Cook with Leftover Potato Chips3," Try sprinkling some crunched up potato chips over some roasted vegetables rather than bread crumbs. Then bake them as you normally would if you were using regular bread crumbs.You’ll need to make sure the chips are crushed finely enough. To do so, you can put them in a food processor. Or you can put them in a sealed plastic bag and go over them with a rolling pin many times.
You may need to add a dash of flour and an egg to the crushed chips to create a bit of moisture. Otherwise the chips may not adhere to the vegetables as bread crumbs would.

, Combine 1  c (240 mL) of heavy cream, 1⁄2  c (120 mL) of milk, and 1  c (240 mL) of crumbled blue cheese in a saucepan and heat it on low heat until the cheese dissolves.

Heat up the stove by building a nice fire in it with the damper(s) wide open.,
Get your cooking gear out and the ingredients ready.

,
As you heat up the stove, put a kettle or pot of water on to heat as well.,
Test the top of the stove by tossing a DROP of water on it.,
Vary your technique depending on what you're cooking:

To make soup, put on a pot, let it heat up well (keep the stove hot, adding wood as necessary and opening/closing the damper to try to maintain a temperature), fry whatever you want fried (meat, onion, etc) and add some boiling water or soup stock.,
When done cooking, turn the dampers down and let the stove cool a bit, but keep that pan of water on there.",How to Cook on a Wood Stove,";
,, You'll need it for soup, stew, tea, coffee, dish washing...everything. It also serves as a heat-storage measure so use a big kettle. A canner works well.

, If the water sizzles and danced, the stove is pretty much ready.

, If you add cold water it will take forever to heat up again...that pan of hot water is crucial.






To ""bake"" something, put it in a pan (cake, bread) or in foil (potatoes) and if the top of the stove is very hot put foil items on a trivet or a bit of crumpled foil. Then cover with a larger pan that goes all the way down to the stovetop. Big metal bowls also work for this sort of make-shift oven.






You can use the fire-box of the stove as a sort of broiler or tandoori oven. Wrap whatever you want to cook in heavy foil and put in the coals after things have cooled down a bit (warning...you may turn your food into charcoal).






To fry on the stovetop, use a thin thin pan. Cast iron pans on a cast iron stove take forever to heat up so might work for soups and stews left all day, but not great for frying. If you don't have a thin frying pan or saucepan to use, back to the heavy-duty foil! (a coffee can will work too!). Set the pan on the stove, oil it up well. Test for hotness with a drop of water and fry away.

Use a spatula to spread the polenta evenly in the dish.






Cover the dish with a lid or aluminum foil.







, Let it chill until the polenta becomes firm. Check the polenta after about 2 hours to determine whether it is firm. If it is still warm and soft, allow it to chill for another half hour.

, Each piece should be about two inches by two inches (5cm by 5cm), the size of a serving.


The slices can be shaped like squares, rectangles, or triangles, as long as they are about one serving size.







, Pour the oil into the skillet and let it heat until just before smoking.

, Cook them until the first side is browned, about 3 minutes. Flip them and brown them on the other side.


Make sure the oil is hot enough to fry before you place the polenta in the pan. Otherwise it may fall apart before it gets brown.

Most types of mince contain enough fat to cook without the use of separate oils or cooking fats, but coating the skillet with oil can further prevent sticking or scorching. This can be especially helpful if you use a stainless steel pan.
If you choose to omit the oil, you'll need to watch the mince more closely during the first few minutes of cooking time. More stirring might be required to prevent scorching.;
, Place the mince in the center of the hot skillet. Use a stiff, heat-resistant spatula to break the meat into large chunks.


Use fresh or thawed mince instead of frozen.
If your skillet is not large enough for the full amount, you can cook the mince in batches. Add more oil and reheat the pan as needed before each separate batch.

, As the mince browns, continue breaking it apart until it eventually turns into moderately sized crumbles.


Stir the crumbles periodically as they continue cooking. The stirring should help the mince cook evenly while minimizing the risk of scorching it or drying it out.
Cooking the mince on a moderately high heat setting should encourage the liquid to evaporate, but if a large puddle of liquid starts to develop, carefully tilt the pan to drain it. Allowing the mince to cook in its juices won't make it unsafe, but it may make the meat taste boiled instead of sauteed., Lightly coat the crumbled mince with salt. Gently toss the seasoned mince with your spatula to help distribute the salt.


This step is also optional, but the addition of salt can help flavor and preserve the meat. If you want to use additional spices when making mince, you should add them during this step.

, When the mince seems evenly browned, break open one of the largest crumbles and check the inside. You should not be able to see any pink in the meat.


You should be able to determine doneness visually, but if you decide to check the mince with a meat thermometer, it should reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius).

, You can use the cooked mince immediately, or you can let it cool and store it for later use.


If you plan to store the mince, remove the skillet from the heat and allow the meat to cool to room temperature. Transfer it to an airtight container and keep it in your refrigerator for up to one week, or in your freezer for up to three months.

, Place a microwave-safe colander in the center of the dish, then place the mince in the center of the colander.You can skip the colander if desired, but using one will allow more of the fat to drain and prevent it from cooking into the meat. A microwavable strainer or trivet set could accomplish the same purpose.
If using frozen mince, thaw it overnight in your refrigerator before cooking it.

, Pour the water into the dish and around the dish. Use enough water to fill approximately 1/4 inch (6 mm) of the dish.


Microwaves can dry out food, but adding water to the dish can keep the air humid and should help prevent the meat from drying out.

, Evenly drizzle the Worcestershire sauce over the top of the mince, adding just enough to lightly coat the exposed surface of the meat.


Most forms of mince do not brown on their own in the microwave due to the short cooking time. Worcestershire sauce isn't strictly necessary, but it will add more flavor and color to the finished mince.
Consider using other brown sauces or seasonings to add color, as well. Options worth trying include dry onion soup mix, teriyaki sauce, barbecue sauce, and steak sauce.

, Loosely cover the entire dish with microwavable plastic wrap. If you use a colander, cover both the colander and the dish beneath it.


You could cover the dish with a microwavable lid, too, if one is available.
Covering the dish helps the mince retain more moisture as it cooks. It can also prevent messy splatters.

, Place the dish in your microwave and cook the mince on full power for 2 minutes.


Overall cooking time can vary depending on the wattage of your microwave, but 2 minutes should be a safe start time even when using a high-powered microwave.

, Chop up the mince with a spatula or fork. Stir the crumbles, then return the meat to the microwave and continue cooking in 30-second intervals until done.


The mince will be finished once the meat is steaming hot and brown all the way through. Cut open one of the largest crumbles to verify that no pink remains.
You shouldn't need to check the mince with a thermometer, but if you choose to do so, the internal temperature should be at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius).

, Drain the water and fat from the finished mince, then use the meat immediately or store it for later use.


When kept in an airtight container, cooked mince remains good for up to one week in the refrigerator or three months in the freezer.

, Pour the oil into a large skillet and place the pan on your stove over medium-high heat.

, Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the hot oil. Cook, stirring frequently, for approximately 3 minutesWait until both ingredients become softer and more fragrant. The onion should start looking semi-translucent, and the garlic should deepen in color.

, Place the mince in the skillet. Break it apart with a wooden spoon and stir it into the onion and garlic mixture.


Use fresh or thawed mince. Frozen mince should be defrosted overnight in your refrigerator for best results, but if you're short on time, you can thaw it using the microwave's “defrost” setting.

, Continue cooking the mince, stirring frequently, for approximately 8 to 10 minutes. Thoroughly brown the meat before advancing to the next step.


All sides of the mince should be brown before you continue, but it's okay if a hint of pink remains inside some of the larger crumbles since the meat will continue cooking for a while longer.
Consider draining any large puddles of liquid or fat from the skillet before moving onto the next step.

, Pour the undrained can of tomatoes into the skillet, then evenly sprinkle the contents of the skillet with oregano and black pepper. Stir to combine.


Other seasonings could be added during this step, as well. Consider using a dried blend of Italian herbs instead of the oregano, or a combination of red pepper and paprika instead of the black pepper and oregano.

, Stir the beef granules into 1/2 cup (125 ml) of steaming hot water until dissolved. Pour the mixture into the skillet and bring everything to a boil.If you would prefer to omit the beef flavor, you do not need to add the beef granules. Simply pour plain water into the skillet during this step. You could also use vegetable stock granules instead of the beef granules.

, Reduce the heat to medium-low and allow the mince to simmer for approximately 20 minutes, or until the mince is finished cooking and the flavors have combined.


Stir the contents of the skillet every 5 minutes or so.
If the liquid evaporates before the mince finishes, add more water. Pour additional water into the skillet 1/4 cup (60 ml) at a time.
Do not add any extra water during the last 5 minutes. When ready, the mince should be somewhat dry.

, You can use the prepared mince immediately or store it for use in later dishes.


If you choose to save the mince, remove the skillet from the heat and let the meat cool to room temperature. Place the finished mince in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for up to one week, or in the freezer for up to three months.

Let the pork rest for 10 under a foil tent before slicing against the grain.Make sure every slice includes the crispy pork rind on top.

",How to Cook Pork Crackling," This recipe can only be done with a thick layer of fat atop the roast. Some cooks insist the pork belly and shoulder, two fatty cuts of meat, produce the best crackling.;
, Remove it from the refrigerator and place it in a roasting pan with the fat layer facing up.

, You will need to score the fat in parallel lines about a finger width apart to ensure it renders the fat as it cooks. Make sure not to cut all the way through the fat.


Score the fat in a direction perpendicular to the longest side of the pork roast.

, Tying the roast is especially important if it is stuffed or if the roast was not cut in one uniform piece.

, Some cooks recommend you salt the roast and place it back in the refrigerator for a few hours. Then, remove it and continue with oil and a second salting.


Pat the pork dry with a paper towel before you cover it in oil. Excess moisture and oil don’t mix.

Sear meat in your skillet.,
Roast or char veggies perfectly.,
Fry eggs in your cast iron.,
Bake the perfect crust.",How to Cook in a Cast Iron Skillet1," One of your skillet’s greatest assets is its ability to give meats a high sear without scorching them. For instance, steak and roasts come out great. Slowly heat the pan over a constant flame by turning a burner on low, and periodically increasing the flame size every few minutes. Once the burner is on high, add a piece of steak and cook until its surface is deep brown. This will happen before any burnt, black bits accumulate in the pan. Searing times will vary based on the type of meat you're cooking.Similarly, sear the outer edges of a meatloaf before depositing the skillet in the oven to bake, per a specific recipe.
Burgers cooked on cast iron will also develop a crispy, delicious crust along the entire outer surface - not just the grill rack. Larger steaks will admittedly fit better on a grill, but you can cut them into smaller portions to fit into your skillet.;
, You can use your cast iron as a small wok, another type of dish prized for the ability to retain heat. The key to a great stir-fry is a hot enough skillet to crisp the rice and meat, but doing so in a time frame that allows the veggies to retain a desirable crunch. Cook to whatever level of roast or char your prefer.More specifically, your veggies will get that perfect, golden hue and crispy exterior layer by coming into direct contact with the steadily high heat of a cast iron surface.

, Once your skillet is well-seasoned, it will cook some prime fried eggs. However, hold off on eggs until you can easily clean your skillet simply by wiping it with a towel. This indicates it is seasoned well enough to cook eggs and prevent them from sticking.Watch out cooking scrambled eggs or frittatas on cast iron, as they are more likely to stick than other dishes.

, Frankly, proper corn bread should only ever be cooked on cast iron. As with all cast iron dishes, preheat the skillet first over a slowly increasing flame while the oven gets up to temp. Note the sizzle of the skillet as you pour in the batter - that’s the sound of crunchy golden crust developing quite nicely.Since cast iron excels at evenly distributing heat (once heated), the surface is perfect for creating an evenly-textured crust on baked goods generally."

Store eggs in the main part of the refrigerator.,
Crack eggs on a flat surface.,
Boil eggs without actually boiling them.,
Scramble eggs over simmering water.",How to Cook Like Heston," Instead of relying on the appearance of meat, fish, and poultry, check the internal temperature with a cooking thermometer.Insert the thermometer in the center of the thickest portion to check for doneness.
Visual clues tend to appear only after food has been overcooked. For instance, you'll know that salmon is safe to eat when white dots form on the surface, but it's technically overcooked at that point. Checking for an internal temperature of 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius) is a better option.;
, You can make oxtail and other cuts of meat more flavorful by cooking them in oil seasoned with star anise and onion.


Slice a medium-sized onion and break a star anise in half.
Brown them together in a little oil, cooking until they become more aromatic. This process creates sulfur compounds that are capable of enhancing meaty flavors.
Add the meat and cook as usual after these aromatic ingredients have been browned.

, Carve bone-in cuts of meat toward the bone, then run the knife along the side of the bone to slice the meat off.


Meat fibers run parallel to the bone.
Cutting the meat in this manner allows you to bite into the fibers, making the meat seem more tender.

, For every 3.5 oz (100 g) of pasta, use 1 quart (1 L) of water and 0.35 oz (10 g) of salt.


Salt enhances the flavor and improves the texture of pasta.

, Instead of pressing ground beef into patties, roll it up into a log and slice off patty-sized portions.Sprinkle the beef with salt and let it sit for three hours. Salt draws out a compound known as myosin, which binds together the beef like egg and breadcrumbs would.
Lay the minced strands of beef out in parallel lines. Roll the beef into a log using plastic wrap and let the log sit in your refrigerator for two or three hours.
This process creates a more tender beef patty.

, The next time you make chicken stock, sprinkle the chicken pieces with skimmed milk powder before roasting them.


Use chicken wings instead of whole roasting chickens or white meat. Remove the meat from the bones and chop it into rough pieces.
Dust the chicken pieces with an even, light coat of skimmed milk powder. You can add carrots, onions, and other vegetables or seasonings to enhance the flavor as desired.
Roast the chicken as usual and strain the liquid for stock.
The proteins and carbohydrates in the chicken meat react during the cooking process, creating the brown flavorful bits on the surface of the meat. The milk powder adds more proteins and carbohydrates, thereby creating more of those bits and more meaty flavor.

,


Too much flour can dull the cheesy taste of the sauce.
Grate the cheese into thick shreds and toss those shreds with a little corn starch. Use just enough to coat the strands lightly and evenly.
Simmer the milk or liquid called for in your recipe, adding the coated cheese in small amounts until the entire batch is melted.
You can finish the sauce with butter and other seasonings, if desired, but doing so is not necessary.

, Take the steak out of your freezer and remove any packaging. Let it sit out for two days in your refrigerator before you plan on cooking it.


Place a tray or plate underneath it to catch any juices, but do not cover it.
The air circulating around the steak will dry it out and essentially cure it. This means that the flavor will be more concentrated and the meat itself will become more tender.

, Two to three hours before you plan on cooking the steak, remove it from the refrigerator and set it out on your counter. Allow the meat to drop to room temperature.


Note that the exterior may seem notably dry at this point, so you may wish to trim away the dry crust with kitchen scissors or a sharp knife.
Room temperature meat cooks more evenly than cold meat. This tip can be applied to other cuts of beef and meat, as well.

, Season both sides of the steak with generous amounts of salt. Do not add pepper or any other seasonings at this time.


Pepper and other seasonings can become scorched when they come into contact with a hot pan, ruining the taste as a result.

, Place the pan on your stove over the highest heat setting for 10 to 15 minutes before adding your oil and your steak.


Heat the pan without oil.
When you add the oil, it should immediately start smoking.
Only add enough oil to coat the surface cracks of the steak. Using 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of oil for 1 lb (450 g) of steak should be enough. Groundnut oil and grapeseed oil are ideal choices, but other vegetable based oils can also work.
The extremely high heat will cause the proteins and sugars in the meat to react, forming a thick brown crust.

, When you place the steak in the pan, put it in so that it falls away from you.


The oil can splash when you add the meat. If the meat falls in your direction, that hot oil can splash onto you.

, Convention demands that a steak only be turned once during the cooking process, but Heston Blumenthal recommends flipping it every 15 to 20 seconds.The idea is to give the steak regular pulses of intense heat. This practice applies a more even heat to the steak.
Steaks are roughly 70 percent water, but when you cook the steak on the same side for a long time, the proteins contract and squeeze most of that moisture out. As a result, the traditional practice of searing a steak on one side for a prolonged period can actually dry the meat out.
This practice should also be applied when cooking beef patties.

, When the steak has reached the level of doneness you desire, remove it from the pan and let it sit on a wire rack for five minutes.


Do not place it on a plate since all of the heat will be trapped inside.
Letting the steak rest before you cut into it will keep more of the juices inside, thereby preventing the steak from drying out when you cut into it.
You can add any pepper, butter, or other seasonings to the steak right before slicing into it.

, Even if your refrigerator has an egg compartment in the door, you should store the carton of eggs in the main body of the appliance.


The door is warmer than the main body, so the eggs won't be preserved as well when stored in the door.
Eggs will rattle and shake when you open and close the door if you store them there. Even though the shells may not break, the walls of the yolk and white can weaken.

, When you need to crack eggs, do so by tapping them against a flat surface. Do not tap them against the side of a bowl.


This method reduces the risk of getting eggshell into the mix.

, Place the eggs in a small saucepan and cover them with cold water. Heat the pan on your stove and remove it as soon as the water starts to boil. Finish cooking the eggs in this hot water.


Use the smallest pan possible. The eggs should fit in one layer, but there should not be much room for them to slide around.
Heat the saucepan with the lid on over the highest heat setting.
Keep the eggs in the hot water for six minutes if you want them soft-boiled, 8 minutes for medium-boiled, and 17 to 19 minutes for hard-boiled.

, Instead of scrambling eggs over direct heat, use indirect heat to create creamy eggs instead of grainy ones.Lightly whisk together the eggs and a little dairy. Use milk, cream, and butter to give the eggs a rich flavor. For four eggs, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) milk, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) cream, and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) softened butter should suffice.
Set a saucepan of water over the stove and bring it to a gentle simmer over medium heat.
Place a separate bowl over the saucepan and pour your egg mixture inside.
Stir the egg mixture continually until it thickens like a custard and forms solid lumps. This process should take about 15 minutes.

Learn to ""cut down"" the ingredients of a recipe.,
Freeze the rest.,
Buy smaller portions of everything.,
Enjoy eating just in time rather than hoarding up food just in case.,
Enjoy quality food.,
Learn how to turn leftovers into a range of easy dishes.",How to Cook for One," If you feel like there is too much involved, it can put you off cooking. Easy recipes and easy cooking styles will give you the motivation to cook and enjoy the fresh flavors. Some of the best styles of cooking for one include:


Sauteing
Steaming
Roasting

Grilling or broiling.;
, There are numerous cookbooks available for single person cooking, such as Solo Suppers and Going Solo in the Kitchen. Having just a few of these books will provide you with ample inspiration from which you can start developing your own recipe ideas.


Look online for recipes for one. It's much easier to find recipes made for one than hunting through lots of recipe books. Try searches such as ""cooking for one"", ""recipes for one"", or the name of a dish you like ""for one"".

, When you check for the number of servings in a recipe, you'll find that some are just too large an amount. For easy recipes, such as stir-fries, soups, roasting, grilling, and broiling, it is easy to cut down on the amounts.


Look for recipes that feed two persons. These are more common than recipes for one and it's easy to place the extra in the fridge for tomorrow's lunch or dinner.
Be very careful cutting down recipe amounts for baked foods (cakes, pastries, bread, etc.) and complex dishes. The amounts cannot always be cut without disrupting the cooking outcomes. Read up on why some ingredients form a part of certain dishes so that you know what be reduced and what needs to stay in the original amount.

, Rather than cutting down the recipe amount, make your own frozen dinners. This can be a fantastic way of freeing you up from cooking every night and will provide the motivation to cook some of the more complex recipes in the knowledge that your effort will result in several meals.

, Look for foods divided into sachets, small packets, etc., so that you don't have to use up huge amounts of the food. Also learn how to store used ingredients for longer, such as freezing pasta sauce, stock, or tomato paste in ice cube trays and using small amounts as needed rather than throwing anything away unused.


One chicken breast, fillet of fish, piece of steak is a portion you can easily cook up at home with the addition of some steamed vegetables.

, Find your local favorite grocery store, fruit and vegetable store, butcher, etc., and be a very regular food shopper. Pick up fresh items daily to every 2-3 days in only the portions needed. That way, you'll always be eating fresh, you'll enjoy

, There is only one of you, so think about splurging on the best food items now and then because they won't be as expensive for one person, especially when it comes to meat and fish.

, Leftovers can be easily turned into soup, stews, filo-pie filling, cold salads (with crusty bread), omelets, frittata, etc. These leftover dishes are very easy, quick, and stretch your food further.

Mince garlic, if necessary.,
Mix your sauce.,
Add oil and garlic to a heated pan or wok.,
Stir fry your lettuce.,
Sauce and season your stir fry.",How to Cook Lettuce1," You could try a lettuce stir fry with many different kinds, but for this recipe, iceberg lettuce is recommended. If you dislike iceberg lettuce, you could also try a similar variety, like romaine.Including lettuce, you'll also need:


Garlic cloves
Kitchen knife
Iceberg lettuce (1 head)
Large frying pan (or wok)
Pepper
Rice wine (or dry sherry)
Salad oil
Salt
Sesame oil
Small bowl (or container; for mixing)
Soy sauce
Spoon
Sugar
Whisk (optional; recommended);
, After washing, it's likely your lettuce will still have some moisture on it. Pat the lettuce dry with a clean dishrag, paper towel, or allow it to air dry. Once the lettuce is dry, tear it into pieces slightly larger than bite-size., You can buy garlic pre-minced at your local grocery store, but fresh garlic often has a richer flavor. Break fresh garlic into pieces (cloves), remove its smooth outer skin, then use a knife to cut it lengthwise and crosswise until it is finely chopped., Take your small bowl and add 1½ teaspoons of soy sauce, 1½ teaspoons of sesame oil, and ¾ of a teaspoon of sugar to it. Use a whisk or other stirring tool, like a spoon, to thoroughly blend the ingredients until the sugar has been absorbed.This sauce will be added to the dish after the lettuce has cooked. Set it off to the side for later., For this dish, you'll want a relatively large pan or wok so the food isn't packed in too densely. A crowded pan can be difficult to stir. Heat your pan with a medium heat, then:


Coat the inside of your pan with salad oil. When the oil heats, tilt the pan back and forth to completely cover its bottom.
When your pan is coated, add your minced garlic. Stir the garlic regularly over medium heat until it starts to color., Add your lettuce to the pan. Stir it with the oil and minced garlic until all ingredients are thoroughly mixed. Continue to cook the lettuce until it is a little limp, yet still somewhat crisp.In most cases, it will take no more than 2 minutes before your lettuce is ready for the sauce to be added.

, You're in the home stretch. Take your bowl of sauce and drizzle it onto the ingredients in your pan. Continue to stir the ingredients for no more than one minute. Then, use a spoon to toss all ingredients until it is consistent throughout. Allow the food to cool, and after that:


Sample your creation. If you notice it could use a little salt, pepper, or some other kind of seasoning, add more of this now.
As soon as the food has cooled, your lettuce stir fry is ready to eat. Serve it and enjoy."

Sauté peppers and onions together.,
Heat the butter and oil.,
Add the red pepper, onion and salt.,
Serve the sautéed peppers and onions.",How to Cook Red Peppers1," This basic preparation is often used to top sandwiches, quesadillas, pizzas, or as a filler in vegetable lasagna. You will need the following simple ingredients to prepare sautéed peppers: 1 red bell pepper, seeded and cut into strips
1 small white onion, thinly sliced
1 tablespoon of butter
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Pinch of kosher sea salt;
, You can do this in a skillet.Heat the oil and butter over medium heat.
Make sure it is hot but not smoking.
Be careful not to heat the oil and butter too long, or the butter will begin to burn.
Burnt butter will ruin the taste of your pepper and onion mixture.

, You can stir the vegetables with a heat safe spatula or shake the pan to stir them.Toss frequently to insure that the peppers and onions cook evenly.
Cook the vegetables until they are soft and browned.
This should take about 7-8 minutes using medium heat.

, You can use these as a simple side dish.You can also put these on sandwiches, pizzas, and in quesadillas.
This basic preparation is also a popular topping for steaks and chicken.
You can prepare these ahead of time, storing them in the refrigerator for later use.

See if you can separate the bacon into slices.,
If you can't separate the slices, heat the block on low.,
Peel pieces off as they loosen.,
Cook the separated pieces as normal.",How to Cook Frozen Bacon1," When frozen, bacon can more or less be cooked in the same ways as when it isn't frozen: frying, baking, microwaving, etc. There is just one major difference: if the frozen bacon slices are stuck together, you need to separate them first.If you froze the slices separately or you can pry them apart easily, you're set. Simply cook the bacon as you normally would, allowing a little extra cooking time to compensate for the fact that they are frozen. Some meats take an extra 50% of their original cooking time to cook from frozen, but bacon slices are so thin that they'll usually only take an extra minute or two at most.;
, Often, if you freeze a package of bacon, it will form a large solid block that can't easily be broken into individual slices. This is OK — you can still cook your bacon fairly quickly. Start by cooking the entire block with low heat to loosen up the slices. There are a few ways to do this:


The easiest is generally to put the frozen block into a frying pan and heat it over a burner set to ""low."" Turn it frequently to ensure even cooking.
You can also put the block on a paper towel-lined plate and use your microwave's ""defrost"" setting.
Don't use the oven to loosen up a block of frozen bacon. It's usually too much trouble to constantly transfer it in and out as you check it for doneness.

, The low heat will quickly start to soften the outer layers of the bacon block. As they soften, they'll become much easier to remove. Peel the individual pieces of bacon off as soon as you can do so. Lay them next to the block or in a separate dish.


Use a set of tongs or another utensil here. You're using low heat, but it can still be enough to burn you.

, Once all the pieces are separated, they should be most of the way (if not completely) thawed, so you can cook them as normal. Our guide to cooking bacon has detailed instructions on how to do this. In broad strokes, you should:


Turn the heat up to medium-low or medium. If you removed the bacon from the pan while it was defrosting, transfer it back in.
Let the bacon cook until it starts sizzling. At this point, start turning the slices every few minutes to ensure even cooking.
When the bacon is well-browned and reaches your desired level of done-ness, transfer it to a paper towel-lined plate. You're done!

Preheat your skillet.,
Note the effect on your iron intake.,
Cook fish carefully.,
Cook only what you’ll want to taste again.",How to Cook in a Cast Iron Skillet2," Never place food in your cast iron before heating the skillet up first. Doing so will likely cause the food to stick. Preheat slowly, and be aware that the skillet will heat unevenly until the whole thing becomes extremely hot. Start preheating on a low heat and slowly increase to medium-low, than medium, and so on over the course of a few minutes. This will allow you to control the level of heat in the skillet itself if you want to stop short of searing temperature., The food you cook in your cast iron skillet will have higher iron content. This comes directly from the skillet itself, so the longer food is in the skillet, the more iron it will absorb.While iron is an essential nutrient, it can be dangerous to consume too much. That said, eating from a cast iron skillet will usually only add a few mg of iron to your meal.

, There are better options for cooking fish, such as tilapia, that has a high likelihood of breaking apart if it partially sticks to your skillet. If you do want to cook fish in your skillet, opt for a thicker cut, and cook it skin-side down.As a caveat, cast iron skillets offer perhaps the best way to blacken the outer edge of a cut of fish while leaving the inside moist and tender. Preheat the skillet for a full five minutes on a constant flame before putting the fish in the pan. You can perfectly sear scallops in this manner as well., There is another reason you may not want to cook fish in your skillet: your skillet will take on flavor from the dishes you cook in it. This could be problematic if you follow a fish dinner with a fruit cobbler, because desert may taste a bit too much like the main course.If you want to cook both savory and sweet dishes regularly, consider getting separate cast iron skillets for each purpose. You can make one work, but be sure to give a solid salt-scrub and a re-seasoning before baking something after a differently-flavored dish.

Care for your cooking tools.,
Get creative to make cooking fun.,
Use a thermometer.,
Learn how to use cooking skewers.,
Add oil to the pan sides.,
Do not dress the salad.,
Never throw away turkey leftovers.,
Cook vegetables quickly.,
Keep your kitchen clean and organized.,
Use a plan.",How to Cook Like a Pro with These Simple Tips and Tricks," It is important to properly care for your wood cutting board if you want it to last a long time. Keep a wood cutting board away from heat and too much or too little moisture, as this can cause warping and splitting. If you have to clean your cutting board, use a sponge rather than immersing it in soapy water. If you need to restore a board that is damaged, regularly apply an oil that is formulated for wooden cutting boards. Let it dry for a while after oiling.;
, You need not follow a recipe exactly. Adapt recipes to your tastes by adding or removing an ingredient, or even creating something from scratch. That is really a creative cook!Always use fresh seasonings and herbs in simple dishes. If the recipe is complicated and combines many different flavors, dried herbs are acceptable. However, fresh herbs are much better and will produce a stronger, fresher and overall better taste. Small herb gardens can be wonderful to make sure that fresh, natural herbs are always available.

, Guessing how long food will take on the grill is nearly impossible. It is always wise to utilize a good meat thermometer (a digital one is best to give you an exact reading) to ensure that the inner portions are cooked correctly. For meat that is more than an inch and a half thick, you might want to close the lid of the grill to decrease the cooking time.

, If you think you want to try cooking with skewers, there are a couple things you should know. Regarding metal skewers, square or twisted varieties are preferable to round ones, as the round ones do not hold food items as well as the other two types., When cooking with oil, add it not to the bottom but to the pan's sides. This will allow the oil to heat up as it works its way down to the center. This will help keep the foods flavor locked in and make for a tasty meal.

, When serving salads to guests, it is a good idea to leave the dressing on the side of the salad rather than on it. Let people add what they want to their salad. You should also provide a large variety of dressings to serve your guests.

, Rather, cut up the meat and store in in the freezer. You can keep it fresh for several weeks, so that you can use the turkey in sandwiches or salads.

, Quickly cooking vegetables allows them to retain much of their nutritional value. Vegetables that have been slow-cooked are not as nutritional or tasty as vegetables that are cooked in other ways. Speed cooking vegetables also retains the best texture and nutrition. The less time you take to cook them, the better your vegetables will be.

, Having a clean and organized kitchen is essential to cooking a great meal or dessert. An organized cooking station is a productive cooking station.

, If you just cook without a plan, you will waste lots of food, which is the same as wasting lots of money.As you season meat, you should try a cooking a little piece first. The meats like meatballs, meatloaf, and hamburgers need careful seasoning. Avoid cooking all of it after it's been seasoned. Instead, make a small piece in the shape of a patty and initially cook that first. After you do this you can either completely cook it or add more seasoning as you see fit.

Collect your grilling supplies.,
Cut your lettuce into quarters.,
Heat your grill.,
Grill your lettuce.,
Remove your lettuce and season it.,
Allow to cool and enjoy.",How to Cook Lettuce2," Meatier, crisper, thicker leaves of lettuce will hold up better to the heat of the grill. For this reason, radicchio lettuce is the preferred kind for grilling, though you might also have success grilling comparable varieties, like Belgian endive.Along with your lettuce, you'll also need:


Balsamic vinegar
Black pepper (fresh ground preferred)
Cow's Milk Cheese
Kitchen knife
Olive oil
Sea salt
Serving plate
Tongs (or spatula)
Treviso radicchio lettuce (2 heads)

, If, after washing your lettuce, some moisture remains on it, use a clean dishrag or paper towel to pat it dry. Then, using a sharp kitchen knife, cut your two heads of lettuce into quarters. Spread the quarters onto a clean serving dish and drizzle each quarter with olive oil to lightly coat each one.


The olive oil will help your seasoning stick to the lettuce, so this is the perfect time to add salt, pepper, or other seasonings to your lettuce., First check your grill to make sure it has gas and that its equipment is hooked up correctly. A loose hose can cause a dangerous gas leak. After that, set your grill to a medium heat and allow 5 to 10 minutes for the grill to heat up.


To protect against your grill charring your lettuce too much, you may want to cook the lettuce on the grill in a heavy cast iron pan., Add the lettuce to the surface of your grill. While it cooks, turn it often with a spatula or pair of tongs. When the lettuce is somewhat soft, browned, and a little charred, remove it from the grill. This often takes about 12 minutes of grilling.


While your lettuce is grilling, you might want to take a quick minute to rinse off your serving plate. This way, you can reuse it for serving the lettuce when it's done., Using a pair of tongs or a spatula, take your lettuce from the grill and return it to your serving plate. Use your kitchen knife to cut 2½ oz (75 g) of your cow's milk cheese, then add the cheese atop the lettuce. Over top this, sprinkle 2 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar.


The remaining heat in your lettuce should cause the cheese to melt atop it. If your lettuce has cooled too much, you might return it to the grill for a moment or melt the cheese in your microwave., Following a few minutes of cooling time, your grilled lettuce will be ready to eat. You might want to sample a piece before serving to test the seasoning. If you find the flavor lacking, now's the perfect time to add a dash more of whatever seasoning you've used."

Braise the lettuce.,
Add your chicken stock or broth to the pan.,
Finish braising in the heated broth.,
Drain the oil, cool, and layer cheese on the lettuce.",How to Cook Lettuce3," This particular recipe involves placing your braised lettuce on a toasted piece of bread. This means that a larger kind of leaf, like those found in romaine lettuce, the fuller the topping for the bread. You can also substitute similar kinds of lettuce to romaine, like iceberg or butterhead lettuce.Including lettuce, you'll also need:


Black pepper (cracked)
Bread knife (optional)
Chicken stock (or vegetable broth)
Ciabatta bread (or peasant style bread)
Frying pan (large preferred)
Olive oil
Romaine lettuce (one head)
Sea salt (coarse)

, Your lettuce will likely have excess water on it after you wash it. Take a clean dishrag or paper towel and pat the lettuce dry. From your lettuce, choose a several leaves that are firm and green. Depending on the size of your bread and leaves of lettuce, you may want to halve your leaves.Each leaf of romaine that you braise will top your ciabatta or peasant bread. Leaves that are too large might not fit easily atop your bread.

, You may have bought your ciabatta or peasant bread pre-toasted, in which case you won't need to slice or toast it. Otherwise, you'll need to cut the bread with a kitchen knife and toast it either in a toaster or toaster oven., Put your pan on the cook top and set the temperature to medium-high. Coat the bottom of the pan in olive oil by tilting the pan back and forth after the oil has heated.Your oil may not spread easily to some parts of your pan. In this case, you can use a spatula or spoon to spread the oil.

, Add your lettuce to the pan. Use a kitchen utensil, like a spatula or spoon, to apply pressure to the stalks in the center of the leaves. The more contact between the leaves and your pan, the better the braising will be.


Braise lettuce leaves at 1 - 2 minute intervals and flip the leaves with a spatula after each interval.
After your first flip is the ideal time to season your leaves. Have your salt and pepper on hand so you're ready to season., But first, use your spatula or a spoon to remove the lettuce from your pan and set it on a spare plate. Add ¼ cup of chicken stock or vegetable broth to the pan, and bring it to a boil.


To make a richer braising mixture, you could also add to it: ¼ cup white wine, ¼ teaspoon of garlic powder, ¼ teaspoon of red pepper flakes, ¼ teaspoon of dried oregano, and ¼ teaspoon of pepper., Lower heat until the chicken stock/broth is at a simmer. Add your lettuce to the pan, cover it with a lid, and allow it to cook for about 7 minutes. After that, remove the lid and flip each with a spatula or spoon. Return the lid to the pan, and cook it for another 3 minutes.


If your lettuce leaves have turned a dark green color, your braised lettuce is ready! Remove it from a pan with your spatula or spoon.
You can turn leftover stock/broth into a sauce for your lettuce. Simply boil it for a few minutes until it thickens, then add it over top the lettuce after the dish is served., When the lettuce is done, transfer it to some paper towel to cool and absorb excess oil. Spread your cheese over the top of your toasted pieces of bread. Then fold each leaf in half and top each piece of bread with a leaf. Your braised lettuce is ready to eat."

Roast some red peppers.,
Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.,
Put the baking sheet in the oven.,
Check to see that the peppers are fully roasted.,
Steam your peppers.,
Peel and seed your peppers.",How to Cook Red Peppers2," One of the easiest and most common ways to do this is in the oven. Roasted peppers are used in lots of different types of cuisine, so this is an important skill to learn. To roast peppers in the oven, you will need the following supplies and ingredients:Red bell peppers
A paper bag
A towel
A baking sheet
Aluminum foil
Oven

, Roasting peppers requires a high temperature. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
Lay your peppers on the aluminum foil.
The peppers should be on their sides, with the stems pointing to the right.

, Allow the peppers to roast in the oven.


Allow the peppers to roast for 20 minutes.
After 20 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven.
Use tongs to turn the peppers over, 1/2 a turn.
Return the peppers to the oven and roast 20 minutes more.

, The skin should be charred and soft. The skins will be black in spots, and the peppers will be collapsed.
If the peppers don't look ready, roast them for another few minutes.
When they are done remove the baking sheet from the oven.

, You will need to do this so the skins come off easily. The skins will be mostly charred so you will need to remove them before you use them in a dish or eat them.Put the peppers in your paper bag.
Roll the top of the bag to seal it.
Allow the peppers to steam for 15 minutes before taking them out of the bag.

, You will need to do this before using them or eating them. This process can be slightly messy.Slice each pepper vertically and lay the pepper open so it becomes one long piece.
Pull the stem from the top of the pepper. This will come away easily with a clump of seeds.
Use a towel to wipe away any remaining seeds.
Flip the pepper over, skin side up. Peel off the charred skin. It should come away easily.
Some resources will tell you to run each pepper under cold water to remove the skin. This will allow the skin to come away very easily, but you will lose some flavor in this process.

"
"
Broil your peppers as another method for roasting them.,
Preheat your broiler to a high setting.,
Broil the peppers, watching them carefully.,
Steam the peppers in your paper bag.",How to Cook Red Peppers3," This is faster than using the oven, but it is more difficult as they can burn faster. You will need to watch them very closely. To use this method for roasting red peppers you will need: Red peppers
A baking sheet
Aluminum foil
Tongs
A paper bag
A towel
An oven with a broiler function

, The heat setting will need to be high to char the skins of the peppers. Place your oven rack in the middle of the oven, so that there is 8-9 inches between the broiler element and the peppers.
This position in the oven will allow the skins of the peppers to char and the flesh to soften without overcooking the skins.
Line a baking sheet with foil.
Place your peppers on their sides on the baking sheet with the stems pointing to the right.

, The whole broiling process will take about 20-25 minutes.Give the peppers a quarter turn every 5 minutes using tongs.
The peppers will be soft, charred, and collapsing when they are fully roasted.
The skin will be very charred, but this will make them very easy to steam and peel before serving.
Remove the peppers from the oven once they are done.

, This will take about 15 minutes. After steaming, remove the peppers from the paper bag.
Cut each pepper vertically, and spread it open in one big piece.
Pull out the stem and use your towel to wipe away any seeds.
Turn the pepper over and peel the skin off.

Thaw in the refrigerator.,
Thaw in cold water.,
Defrost in the microwave.,
Cook thawed bacon normally.",How to Cook Frozen Bacon2," This is generally the cleanest way to thaw a package of bacon. Simply put it in the fridge in its original container and wait for it to thaw to a uniformly soft texture. This can take anywhere from a couple hours to a day or more depending on your refrigerator's temperature.


This method of thawing generally leaves the bacon usable for the longest amount of time — it's almost as if you transferred fresh bacon directly into the fridge. You can cook or refreeze the bacon within seven days.
For loose slices of bacon, place them inside a sealed plastic bag or container before defrosting. This can help prevent the dehydrating effects of cool refrigerator air.

, Fill your sink with cold water from the faucet. Drop the package of bacon into the water and let it sit. If it floats, weigh it down with a heavy pan or plate. Smaller packages will take 10-15 minutes to fully thaw. Larger packages may take up to an hour. If it takes longer than 30 minutes, dump the water and refill again with cold water.


Don't use warm or hot water. This will make the outside of the bacon warm quicker than the inside, ruining its texture and potentially causing dangerous bacteria growth.
If you're not thawing the bacon in its original package, make sure you seal it in an airtight bag. You don't want the bacon to come into direct contact with the water — this can be unsanitary and may affect the bacon's taste or texture.

, Place the bacon on a paper towel-lined plate and defrost it for three minute intervals, checking its texture between each defrosting. Separate the bacon as it defrosts to speed up the process.


You can leave the bacon in its original package, but if you do, poke a few holes in the package to allow it to vent. If you don't, steam can build up and cause an explosion.

, Once the bacon is completely thawed, you're ready to start cooking. Transfer it to a frying pan (or another vessel if you're using a different cooking method like baking) and cook it as you normally would.


Be sure to wash your hands after handling defrosted bacon. Warming uncooked bacon to luke-warm heat (like most defrosting methods do) makes it a prime breeding ground for bacteria.
Most thawed bacon should be cooked fairly quickly to avoid bacterial contamination. The exception is bacon thawed in the fridge — since it's kept cool, it's generally safer to store.

Clean the skillet immediately after using.,
Dry the skillet thoroughly.,
Re-season your skillet.,
Store cast iron carefully.,
Do not boil water in your skillet.",How to Cook in a Cast Iron Skillet3," After plating your meal, rinse the skillet with hot water. To remove any cooked-on food, try using a kitchen towel or nonmetal brush with a mild abrasive, like coarse salt. Do so while the pan is still warm. The goal is to preserve the nonstick surface a “seasoned” pan has built up. If necessary, use a few drops of a mild dish soap on a sponge - but only do so occasionally. Never bleach your skillet or wash it in a dishwasher.Never allow your skillet to soak. In short, scour, rinse, and dry the pan as soon as is convenient after cooking.
Use steel wool only to remove any coating that becomes sticky, or to remove any rust deposits as soon as they develop. Re-season the pan in these scenarios.
If you’re serving directly from the skillet, be sure to clean it immediately following your meal. Never allow anything wet, such as a fruit pie or frittata, to be served from the skillet. Transfer the food to another dish and wash the skillet immediately., Your skillet’s greatest enemy is rust. The greatest risk of developing rust is related to insufficient drying after cleaning. There are several theories about the best way to dry a cast iron skillet. At a bare minimum, thoroughly wipe down the inside and outside of the skillet with a dry towel.Designate one of your kitchen towels to be used exclusively to dry your cast iron. This will prevent other towels from getting heavily smudged, and will ensure you’re not dirtying your pan with unknown towel contaminants.

, Every couple times you wash your skillet, wipe down the well of the skillet with fat, such as flaxseed oil or lard after drying. This will likely be enough to keep your seasoned skillet’s non-stick surface in good shape. In those cases where you have to remove some of the coating to remove stickiness or a bit of rust, do a more involved re-seasoning.Apply a film of fatty material - ideally flaxseed oil - to the entire surface of the pan, inside and out. Bake the pan at 350˚ for one hour, with foil or a baking pan on the rack beneath it to catch drips. Allow the pan to cool completely in the oven.
A teaspoon of flaxseed oil is plenty for a 10-12in (25-30cm) skillet. Apply whenever the skillet looks visibly dry., Putting away other pans that are still wet may wind up getting water on your cast iron and causing rust. Prevent this by storing your cast iron separately, perhaps by hanging it up. If you do store your skillet with other cookware, place a sheet of paper towel in the well of your skillet to collect any water that sneaks into it.Always let the skillet cool to room temperature - in part to absorb any added oil - before putting it away., This is pretty much the only thing you shouldn’t ever use a cast iron skillet for. Boiling water will increase the likelihood of your pan rusting, the cast iron worst case scenario."

Gently dip and swish the root in the water. Leave it out to air-dry away from sunlight.Do not scrub or roughly wash the ginseng, as this might break the fragile skin.

, Ginseng that has been steamed before being dried is called red ginseng whereas white ginseng has only been dried, not steamed. If you want red ginseng, then you should steam the root for one to three hours.You can use a pot and a vegetable steamer basket, but make sure that there is enough water to steam the root for the proper amount of time.
This step is optional. If your recipe calls for white ginseng, go straight to drying out the root.

, To dry the roots, place a rack or screen in a drying box or closet. Place the roots on the screen, making sure that they do not touch one another. Keep the temperature at 90–95 °F (32–35 °C) for two weeks. Do not use an oven, microwave, or window to dry the roots, as these may dry them out too quickly. Keep the roots away from the sun as you dry them.
Because ginseng roots must dry slowly over two weeks, you should not use your oven. Instead, you can use a a special herb dehydrator. This box will dry your roots out at a low, consistent temperature.

Since most refrigerators and freezers don't include an accurate way to adjust temperature, you need to put thermometers in your freezer and refrigerator.Try to be in the habit of checking the temperature inside the refrigerator and freezer every day. The sooner you catch rising temperatures, the sooner you can adjust the temperature and save the food.;
, Sort through your refrigerator and throw out anything that's moldy, spoiled or past its expiration date. Don't forget to check condiments. You should also clean out your cupboards and throw out anything that you won't actually use or has expired.If you're unsure whether or not something is spoiled, look up recommended storage lengths for foods or err on the side of caution and throw it out.Don't forget to clean through your freezer as well, since many foods develop freezer burn (ice crystals on the food) after 6 months or so.

, Most people know which foods need to be refrigerated (milk, eggs, yogurt, meat, and some produce). But, not many people realize that certain foods should be stored in certain parts of the refrigerator. For example, the door of your refrigerator is one of the warmer parts of the fridge, so only store your condiments there. To properly store food in your refrigerator:Place milk and dairy products on the top shelf of your refrigerator since this is one of the coldest places.
Use the crisper bins correctly. Separate your fruits from the vegetables and place them in their own crisper bins so you can control humidity levels. Vegetables should have higher humidity than fruits.
Keep eggs in their carton so they get proper air circulation.
Store meat on a tray on the lowest shelf of the refrigerator where the fridge is very cold. The tray will catch any drippings and prevent contamination.

, Take the time to wash the shelves of your refrigerator with hot, soapy water at least once a week. This can prevent mold and bacteria from lingering in your fridge. You should also place a clean, absorbent paper towel on the bottom of the refrigerator drawers. You can easily clean up any leaks and the paper towels will absorb any excess moisture.Don't wash your berries and produce before you put them in the refrigerator. This can encourage mold growth. Instead, wash them right before you eat them.

, Always store food in an airtight or vacuum-sealed container if you're planning to freeze it. If you're using plastic wrap, you should also wrap the food in foil to prevent ice crystals (freezer burn) from forming on the food. Label your food and write the date so you can use it before it develops the ice crystals.Meats can be frozen anywhere from 3 months to 1 year. In general, cooked foods, baked goods, and some dairy can be frozen for several months (1 to 4).

, Learn which foods are stored best in the pantry as opposed to the refrigerator (like tomatoes and potatoes). Store the canned foods in your pantry by the order you bought them. This way, you'll use older food before it expires. It's a good idea to write the date on any foods that don't have a clear expiration.


Consider storing food in plastic or glass containers with air-tight seals to prevent food from spoiling. Getting rid of cardboard boxes can also prevent insects and moths from infesting your pantry.

, Some fruits, such as apples, peaches, and bananas, release ethylene gas as they ripen. This can cause spoilage if too much gas is released. Keep foods that release ethylene gas away from those that don't. Foods that release ethylene include:Fruits: apples, apricots, avocados, bananas, blueberries, cantaloupe, cranberries, figs, honeydew, grapes, mangoes, nectarines, papayas, passion fruit, peaches, pears, persimmons, plums, and prunes
Vegetables: green onions, tomatoes

, Write down the food you have in the refrigerator, freezer, and pantry. Make a special note of any foods that have to be used quickly. It can also be helpful to write down whether or not you have a lot of one or two foods.For example, you might make a note that you've got several dozen eggs that need to be used or only a small handful of blueberries that need to be eaten.

, Sit down with your schedule for the week and the list of foods you have on hand. Write down meals that use a lot of the ingredients you already have. Not only will this keep you from throwing food out, but you'll also save money at the grocery store.Refer back to your weekly schedule so you can make realistic meals. For example, don't plan to make a fancy time-consuming meal on a night when you'll be running errands or working late.

, You might find that you get stuck in a meal planning rut. When this happens, try to think of types of meals that use up a variety of ingredients. Don't forget to consider trying meals or recipes that you've never made before. You might want to write down these categories of meals and fill them in with the specifics of what you have on hand:


Stir fries
Salads
Pastas
Soups
Slow-cooker meals
Pizza
Rice-based meals

, Once you've made your meal plan, write down a list of the ingredients that you'll need to buy. Remember to write down the quantity of the things you need so you buy just what you need and no more. This is especially important if you'll be buying food from the bulk bins.Avoid shopping when hungry so that you don't make impulse buys.
You can stay more focused at the grocery store by organizing your list by department. This way, you know exactly what you need from each area and won't buy unnecessary food.
Never use or buy canned foods that are rusty, bent, dented, or bulging. These are signs of bacteria-growth.

, Forty percent of the food made in the U.S. is thrown out.Cut back on your food waste by planning for a ""leftover night"" where you and your family eat the cooked foods that are already in your fridge. It's a good idea to do this before you go grocery shopping since it will help clean out your fridge.


If you don't think you'll be able to eat leftovers, consider freezing them.

, If you have food that is slightly overripe or starting to go limp, try to use them in new foods. For example, make a smoothie with overripe fruit or use them to make a fruit bread. Or, create stock with the limp vegetables so you can make soup one night.


Don't toss that stale bread. You can make bread pudding, cut it into croutons, or process it into breadcrumbs.

, If you have space in your yard or have a garden, use the kitchen waste as a compost. You can use uncooked vegetable scraps, fruit peelings, teabags, coffee grounds, eggshells, and small amounts of paper and cardboard. Over time, the compost can give nutrients back to the soil and you won't need to buy expensive fertilizers.If you live in an apartment, freeze the compost and find a local compost drop like a community garden or farmers' market., Consider using an electric dehydrating machine that absorbs moisture. Or, use your oven on a very low heat (around 60 to 70 degrees) to dry food. Since you'll need to quickly remove moisture to prevent bacteria from spoiling the food, choose foods with low moisture content like fruits. You can also use vegetables and meat although they may take more time to dry.You can also use the sun to dry your food although this works best for foods that won't spoil quickly. Try tying up herbs to air dry for a few weeks.

, You can use a water bath or pressure cooker to can food. Most people are probably more familiar with the water bath method. To use can with a water bath, sterilize your jars and lids in a pot of simmering water. Fill the jars leaving just a little head space, place the lid on till finger tight, and lower the jars into a pot of water. Bring the water to a boil for about ten minutes. Carefully remove the jars and let them form a vacuum seal as they cool on the counter.If using a pressure cooker, follow the manufacturer's instructions that came with yours. Pressure cookers are recommended for low-acid foods like vegetables and meats while the water bath method works well for high-acid foods like fruits.

, Pickled foods are also canned in a water bath, but the food is first mixed with a vinegar and salt brine that preserves the food. Usually, you'll also include a mixture of pickling spices that adds flavor as the food is stored. Good foods to pickle include:Cucumbers (pickles)
Peppers
Lemons
Beets
Green beans
Pork

, Consider purchasing a vacuum packaging machine to extend the shelf life of some foods. The machine removes the oxygen from food that's in a plastic package which can prevent it from spoiling quickly. Good foods to vacuum seal include crackers, nuts, cereals, and any food that you'll be putting into the freezer.Realize that vacuum sealing is not a form of food preservation since it doesn't destroy any bacteria. Instead, it simply keeps your food fresher for a while.

Cook as desired.",How to Kosher Liver," The liver should come from a kosher species (cow, calf, or chicken) that was slaughtered in the matter described by the Torah.


The fats of the liver should have been removed during the time of slaughter.
Ideally, you should purchase liver from an animal that was slaughtered no more than 72 hours ago. The koshering process itself should be performed within 72 hours. If it is performed past that time period, you can only eat it in its broiled state; do not reheat it in a manner that allows the liver to sit in its own juices.;
, As soon as you purchase fresh liver, you should drain the excess blood from the packaging.


Do not allow the liver to sit in its own blood for more than 24 hours.

, If you purchase frozen liver, it needs to be completely thawed before you kosher it to ensure a thorough broil.


When defrosting the meat, do not let it sit in its own blood for more than 24 hours.

, Ideally, you should use a fire source placed directly below the liver, like an open fire, grill, or broiler with a bottom element.It is, however, permissible to use a heat source that broils the liver from above if that is the only option available to you. This would include the broiler of a standard electric oven.
If using the stovetop, cover the surface of the stove with aluminum foil to prevent blood from splashing onto it by accident.

, If you want to use that heat source again, you need to protect it from blood splatter as the liver broils.


The easiest way to do this is to place a solid pan on a rack beneath the grated pan holding the liver. This second pan should be able to catch the blood that drips off, but you should not use it for any other process other than koshering liver.
If blood does drip onto the heat source, you will need to kasher it before using it for kosher foods.

, You can use a fork or tongs to handle the liver as it broils, but these utensils become unclean during the process and should not be used to handle the liver after you kosher it.


You can either kasher the utensils afterward or set them aside and use them for the sole purpose of koshering liver. Do not use unclean utensils with other foods.
Do not let the liver come into contact with serving plates, bowls, knives, and forks before you kosher it.

, If using a beef or calf liver, cut deep criss-crosses into the meat all across one side of the surface.


Alternatively, you could make a single deep cut down the width and a single deep cut down the length of the liver.
These cuts make it easier for the blood to flow out.
You could also cut the liver into smaller pieces or slices of uniform thickness instead of making these incisions.
This step is not necessary if you are using chicken livers due to their small size.

, If you are using a chicken liver, you will need to cut out the gall bladder if the butcher did not do so already.


The gall bladder is green and should look like a small cylinder.

, Rinse the liver under cold water to wash off all outside blood. You should also remove all visible blood clots at this time.

, Sprinkle all sides of the liver with coarse salt immediately before you plan on koshering it.


You should use an amount of salt that you would use to make the liver taste good. You can use more salt if desired, however.
The salt will help to extract the blood during the cooking process.
Salting is not strictly necessary for this koshering process since the actual work is done by heat. If you are on a low-sodium diet, especially for a medical reason, you can skip the salt.

, Place the liver cut-side down on a wire rack or grate.


The grate you use must allow blood and other juices to flow freely from the liver during the broiling process. Do not use a solid pan that will allow the liver to cook in its own juices.
Note that the grate you use during this process will become unclean afterward and must be koshered later if you want to use it again.
If working with more than one piece of liver, you can overlap the liver as it broils, but the cut-sides should still face downward.

, Place the liver over the preheated heat source of medium/moderate heat. Keep an eye on it as it cooks, and turn the liver several times during the broiling process to make sure that all sides of the meat are evenly exposed to the flame.The surface of the liver does not need to be burned, but the entire cut of meat should be at least one-half to two-thirds done.
Typically, the outer juices should stop flowing and the outside should be completely dry.
You could also broil the liver on a hand-operated rotisserie spit as long as the liver is washed after it has been placed on the spit and before it is broiled. Do not rotate the spit constantly; only rotate it several times throughout the process so that the blood can drip off. Also note that the spit will become unclean afterward.

, Rinse the koshered liver under cold, running water three separate times.


This process should remove excess salt and any remaining blood.

, When you cut into the liver, the interior should be a shade of green, tan, light brown, or pink.


Raw liver is deep brown, so if the interior is still deep brown, the liver has not been properly koshered. Re-broil this portion or discard it.
If the outline procedures have been followed and the liver is no longer raw, the meat is consider kosher. Any red juices that flow from the liver after this point are not considered blood and are permissible.

, You can use finish cooking koshered liver using any other cooking method you desire. The meat can be fried, sauteed, roasted, grilled, broiled, or otherwise treated as any other kosher meat.The only exception is when the liver sat out for more than 72 hours before the process was performed. In these instances, a strict interpretation of the law would require you to finish cooking the meat by broiling it out of its own juices.

, This will help to ensure that it is warm enough to eat at lunch time.








Remember that the food will be consumed hours later, not right now. It is okay to make it too hot to eat right away.

, Close the thermos immediately after you put the food into it to lock in the heat. Make sure that the thermos has a tight seal to prevent heat from escaping from it.








If the food in the thermos is for your child, then instruct him or her to ask for help opening the thermos at lunch time. Do not try to seal it loosely so that your child can open it him or herself.

, Keep the thermos closed tightly until you are ready to eat it.

A brown paper bag will not provide any insulation for the food you pack in it. This means that the food you pack may no longer be warm or cold by lunch time.

, Wrapping the thermos in a paper towel or napkin will help to ensure that it stays warm. It will provide an extra layer of protection against the cold from the cold food items in the lunch bag. Wrap a paper towel or napkin all the way around the thermos.








You may want to use a rubber band to keep the paper towel or napkin in place.

If you have a food thermometer, then you can also measure the temperature to ensure that it is at the boiling point.

, Next, transfer the food or water to your preheated thermos. After you have placed your hot food in the thermos, seal the thermos tightly.








Remember that you should always preheat your thermos by filling it with boiling water and letting the water sit for about 10 minutes. Discard the water after 10 minutes and immediately put in your hot food or water.

, Note the time that you put your food or water into the thermos for your test. Consider how long after packing the lunch you would usually be eating or when your child would usually be eating lunch.For example, if you normally pack lunch at 7:30am and then eat at 12:30pm, then you should wait five hours to determine if your thermos is effective.

, After you have waited for the amount of time that your food would normally be in the thermos, open it up and check the temperature.If the food is still warm, then you have a good thermos that will keep your food warm for lunch. If it is cold, then you may want to find a different thermos or try the test again and heat the food or liquid to a higher temperature.
If you have a food thermometer, then you might even check the temperature to ensure it is near the safe range of 140 °F (60 °C). If it is a degree or two off, then this is nothing to worry about. However, if the temperature is much lower, such as 100 °F (37.8 °C), then it might not be safe to eat.

Combine all three ingredients in a medium saucepan.,

Let cool to room temperature.,
Pour the invert sugar into jars.,
Store in the refrigerator.,
Note the benefits of invert sugar.,
Know which recipes benefit most from invert sugar.,
Warm the invert sugar before use.,
Follow the recipe.,
Substitute the invert sugar in place of standard sugar or honey.",How to Invert Sugar," Add the sugar, water, and citric acid to a non-reactive saucepan and stir the ingredients together until combined.


Standard granulated sugar can be used, but extra fine granulated sugar and cane sugar are better options.

Extra fine granulated sugar already consists of smaller crystals, which further reduces the likelihood of crystallization occurring in the inverted sugar syrup.
Cane sugar consists of fairly large granules, but it gives the final product more flavor. It is preferred especially among those using invert sugar for home brewing.


Note that 1/8 tsp (1/2 g) cream of tartar can be used instead of the citric acid if desired. Either ingredient is an adequate acid catalyst and will help the sucrose sugar break down into glucose and fructose. Do not use both cream of tartar and citric at the same time, however.;
, Place the saucepan on a stove and heat it over medium-high. Continue heating until mixture begins to boil gently.


Induction stovetops and electric stoves are preferred over gas stoves for this process. The gentle, even distribution of heat provided by induction and electric stoves is better than the direct heat given off the flames of a gas burner.
Stir the mixture as it heats up to distribute the heat evenly, but stop stirring once the mixture reaches a boil.

, Use a wet pastry brush to scrape stray sugar crystals off the sides of the pan and into the boiling syrup.


Dip the pastry brush in clean water before using it to wash down the sides of the pan. This additional water should not have any effect on the final product.

, Reduce the heat to low or medium-low and allow the mixture to simmer lightly for 20 minutes to 2 hours.Do not stir the sugar mixture as it simmers. Stirring will encourage the sugar particles to clump together, which will increase the risk of crystallization and create a grittier final product.
Keep the temperature low during this part of the process. High temperatures can cause the sugar to caramelize, which could ruin the final product.
Regardless of how long you allow the mixture to boil, it should reach a temperature of at least 236 degrees Fahrenheit (114 degrees Celsius) before you proceed any further past this step.If you want the invert sugar to remain light in color, simmer it for a shorter period of time. To produce a rich amber color, simmer it for a longer period.
Watch the invert sugar syrup as it simmers. Once the volume decreases by one-third of the original volume, stir in another 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water. This will prevent the invert sugar from burning in the pan. Doing so is typically only necessary if you choose to simmer it beyond 30 to 40 minutes, though.

, Remove the saucepan from the heat. Let the invert sugar cool at room temperature until it reaches room temperature.


Keep the saucepan covered as the invert sugar cools to prevent dust and debris from floating in.
After the invert sugar cools to room temperature, it can be used immediately or stored for later use.

, Pour the cooled invert sugar into a large glass jar, leaving at least 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace at the top of the jar. Seal tightly.


You do not need to can the invert sugar, but it the seal should be fairly airtight.
Glass jars work best because they are less permeable than plastic containers, but a plastic container can be used if no glass one is available as long as the plastic container has an airtight lid.
A 1 pt (1/2 L) glass jar should provide enough space for 1/2 lb (225 g) of invert sugar, but if create a larger batch, make sure that you increase the jar size, too.

, Place the sealed jar in your refrigerator. When sealed and refrigerated properly, the invert sugar should be able to last anywhere between 6 months and 1 year.


Check the sweetener for mold before using it. If you see any signs of mold, you should discard the remaining portion.

, Invert sugar is often used in professional and commercial kitchens because, among other benefits, it can increase the overall shelf life of many baked goods. There are other reasons to use invert sugar, too.


The slow heating process breaks down the sucrose into fructose and glucose. The sugar crystals become smaller, so the food made with the invert sugar takes on a smoother texture.The smaller crystals also allows invert sugar to dissolve quicker.
Invert sugar is hygroscopic, so it absorbs moisture from the air. This property keeps bacteria in check and elongates the shelf life of baked goods.Invert sugar has a lower freezing point than standard sugar, so frozen dairy products are less likely to crystallize and more likely to remain soft and easy to scoop.

, Invert sugar is rarely used as a straight sweetener, but you can use it when preparing baked goods, candies, frozen sweets, and home brews.


Baked goods made with invert sugar tend to be softer and have a longer shelf life.
Candies made with invert sugar tend to have a smoother texture.
Ice cream, sorbets, sherbets, and other frozen sweets made with invert sugar tend to develop fewer ice crystals. They also remains softer, smoother, and easier to scoop.'
Home brews benefit from the use of invert sugar because it dissolves quicker, giving the yeast quicker access to the sugar it needs.

, If you are using invert sugar after storing it in your refrigerator, it is usually beneficial to measure out the amount you want and allow it to drop to room temperature before using it in a recipe.


After you've stored the invert sugar for a while, you may notice crystals beginning to form. If this happens, you should gently heat the amount you want to use in a double boiler over low heat, stirring frequently. Within several minutes, the crystals should dissolve again and the invert sugar should be ready to use.

, When a recipe calls for invert sugar, simply add it according to the recipe instructions.


Since invert sugar is primarily used in commercial kitchens, recipes written for the home cook rarely list it as an ingredient. As such, you will usually use invert sugar as a substitute for other sweeteners.

, You can usually use invert sugar in a recipe that calls for standard sugar or honey, but the amount of invert sugar you need to substitute can vary.


Note that invert sugar is sweeter than normal sugar due to the free fructose crystals in it. As a result, you should lose about 25 percent less invert sugar than normal sugar.
When using invert sugar instead of standard granulated sugar, cut down the amount of liquid in the recipe by one-fifth to one-fourth of the amount of measured invert sugar. This adjustment should be made to compensate for the fact that invert sugar is a liquid while standard granulated sugar is a solid.
Substitute invert sugar and honey in equal proportions, however, and do not change the amount of liquid in the recipe.
Since invert sugar retains moisture, it is generally recommended that you only replace half the amount of sugar or honey instead of replacing the full amount.
For example, you can use 1/4 cup (60 ml) of invert sugar and 1/4 cup (60 ml) of honey for a recipe that calls for 1/2 cup (125 ml) of honey.
As another example, you can use 1/4 cup (60 ml) of invert sugar and 1/4 cup (60 ml) of regular granulated sugar for a recipe that calls for 1/2 cup (125 ml) regular granulated sugar. Note that you should also reduce the amount of liquid in this recipe by about 1 Tbsp (15 ml), regardless of whether the recipe calls for 1/4 cup (60 ml) or 3 cups (750 ml).

Save the drippings from the roast when you first cook it.,
Cut the roast into sections if it weighs more than four pounds.,
Gather your supplies.,
Place the roast on parchment paper and foil.,
Moisten the roast with the drippings you kept.,
Wrap up the roast.,
Reheat the roast.,
Reheat slices of roast in a cast iron skillet.,
Try reheating thicker slices of roast with a grill pan.,
Use the microwave to reheat a plate of food including slices of roast.,
Use airtight packaging.,
Push the roast back into the corner of your fridge.,
Dispose of a roast after 3 to 4 days.",How to Reheat a Roast," If you want to reheat a roast for later, the process starts when you first cook the roast. Roasts can dry out in the reheating process, so you'll want to save any fats or fluids that drip off the roast into the baking pan.


You should also cook the roast slightly less done than you prefer. For example, if you prefer a medium rare roast, remove your roast from the oven when it's rare.
Collect the drippings after removing the roast from the oven. You can pour the drippings into a sealable container and store them in the fridge for later.;
, For a larger roast, you'll want to cut your roast into two equally sized sections. If your roast is smaller than 4 pounds, you should be able to reheat it without slicing it into sections.

, When you're ready to cook the roast, you'll need certain supplies. If you do not have the right supplies, purchase them at the grocery store prior to reheating the roast. You will need the following:


Aluminum foil and parchment paper
A tablespoon
A baking sheet

, Place a square of aluminum foil on a baking sheet. If you cut your roast into two sections, use two squares. Place a piece of parchment paper on top of each square of foil. Set a piece of roast on top of each piece of parchment paper.

, Use your tablespoon here. Each piece of roast should be drizzled with 2 to 3 tablespoons (29.6 to 44.4 ml) of the saved drippings. Smaller pieces of roast may only need 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml), while you should go for 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) for larger pieces. The drippings will help the roast from drying out upon being reheated.

, Roll the foil and parchment paper over the roast, until the full roast is covered. Make a tight parcel with each piece of roast, as this will assure the roast remains moist and cooks through during the reheating process.

, Place your pieces of roast on a baking sheet. Transfer to an oven that's heated to 350 °F (177 °C). Heat the roast for 20 to 25 minutes.


Use an instant read thermometer to check to make sure the roast is at a safe temperature to eat. The internal temperature of your roast should be around 145 degrees Fahrenheit.

, If you're just reheating slices of roast, they can be reheated over the stove top. A cast iron skillet can reheat roast while preserving the flavor and most of the moisture. Cut off a few slices of roast at your preferred thickness to start. Keep in mind, however, thinner slices may work better for this method.Heat a cast iron skillet over medium high heat.
Place the slice or slices of roast on the skillet.
Cook the roast for a few minutes. You need to turn it frequently to make sure it cooks evenly, and the meat is reheated completely.

, It may be difficult to cook very thick slices of roast on a cast iron skillet. For this, you can use a grill pan. Slices of about 3/4 inch thick work best for the grill pan method.Preheat your grill pan to a low or medium heat setting.
Place your slices on top of a stoneware plate, or another type of plate that can withstand a lot of heat.
Set the plate on top of the grill pan. After 6 minutes, blood or moisture should begin draining from the roast. It should now be fully heated and safe to eat.

, In general, do not use the microwave to reheat roast. This may be unsafe, and roast dries out in the microwave. However, small portions of a cooked meat dish can be reheated in the microwave. If you're reheating a plate for someone who was late for dinner, the microwave is a quick and easy option.Place vegetables and side dishes towards the center of the plate, with the pieces of roast around the side. You can sprinkle some water on the slices of roast to prevent them from drying out.
Cover the plate with a lid, or with microwave safe plastic wrap. Set the plate towards the outside of the turn table and reheat for 2 minutes.
Let the plate stand for 1 minute before serving.

, When storing a full roast for reheating, it's important you protect the roast from contaminates in your refrigerator. The roast should be wrapped in airtight packaging. Plastic film would work well here. Wrap the roast completely in the packaging. Having any bits of the roast exposed could be dangerous.

, You want the roast to be stored in the coldest portion of your refrigerator. This is usually towards the back of the fridge, so push the roast back there. If you need to make space, do so.

, Leftover meat is usually only good for 3 to 4 days. Make sure you do not eat the roast after this time period. Any leftovers that last longer than 3 to 4 days should be thrown out.It's a good idea to write the date you cooked the roast on its packaging to make sure you do not eat it after 3 to 4 days.

Masticating juicers work by grinding fruits and vegetables, squeezing the juice out in a way that is similar to the way a mortar and pestle works. Since the broccoli sprouts are so small, a masticating juicer is much more likely to be effective than a centrifugal juicer., Collect the celery juice in the same container you collected the broccoli sprout juice in., Continue feeding the vegetables through your juicer, rotating back and forth between the two, until none remain., If you needed to use multiple containers to collect the broccoli sprout juice, combine the juice from each separate container into one large one., The lemon juice preserves and softens the flavor of the juice, which will otherwise be fairly strong., Refrigerate until ready to use or drink immediately in a glass filled with ice. The leftover broccoli sprout juice can be stored in airtight containers up to one week."

Keep it simple.,
Use fresh whole foods.,
Know your audience.,
Know your ingredients.,
Create options.,
Play it safe; put the sauce on the side.,
Be mindful and vigilant!","How to Make a Meal for Someone Allergic to Sugar, Gluten, Milk, and Fat"," You want to be able to be clear and accurate about the exact ingredients that are gracing their plate or bowl.;
, Take it from gourmet chefs the world over: the best way to make a meal shine is to use fresh local ingredients and to keep it simple. Don't buy prepackaged foods, even if they say ""gluten free"" on the label. Prepackaged foods can have hidden dairy, cross-contamination, and are often high in sugar. Not only do you not have to read the label on a carrot, but people with food allergies often have a problem with histamines, which increase as food ages (i.e. leftovers).

, Fat is a macronutrient found in nearly all foods. Even an innocent carrot contains some fat. Sometimes, people can tolerate foods that contain higher amounts of fats like nuts, but not added fats such as olive oil, or vice versa, and sometimes not at all. There are sometimes reasonable thresholds where people can tolerate a small amount (i.e. olive oil), but not over. Sugar is a generic term. Cane sugar is in the grass family and it is not uncommon for people with gluten issues to have issues with cane sugar. While it is easy to avoid adding cane sugar to whatever you are making, some people are avoiding foods with high glycemic index. So, it is important to know your audience.

, There is a lot of misinformation surrounding gluten sensitivities, and there are varying thresholds of sensitivity depending on the condition and reason for avoidance. If you are new to gluten avoidance, to make it simple, all grains contain gluten.


It is a common misconception that only wheat, barley, triticale, and rye are the only gluten containing grains. These are the most frequently offending grains in Celiac Disease. However, there are hundreds of gluten sensitive conditions besides Celiac, and even Celiacs need to look carefully at their other grain consumption.
If you are making a meal for someone who is not only gluten sensitive but suffering multiple sensitivities, it is wise to avoid all grains. This means, don't substitute corn or rice for wheat or rye. Don't go buy something that says ""gluten free"" on the package (GF labeled foods often have sugar and dairy). See step #2, and stick with whole foods.

, Options are great for multiple reasons. No matter where we are in our food sensitivities journey, sticking out for it is never fun. Options during the meal are a great way to create great meals for everyone anyhow. We all love choices and we all like our bowls a little different. After all, we each have different and shifting nutrient requirements.


If you design a meal such as tacos for example, where everyone puts together their own, someone with food sensitivities can feel more comfortable that they won't stick out. (However, watch out for cross-contamination. If you put out cheese for others, make sure it doesn't get accidentally sprinkled into the lettuce.)

, This is really an extension of 'Options'. There is nothing more disheartening to all parties than to have all of the thought and effort that went into making a special 'sensitive-friendly' dish go to waste by one little ingredient spoiling the lot. When in doubt, put the sauce (or spice mix) on the side, so-to-speak. Go for it with the extras; just make them optional just in case.

, As you are cooking, be mindful of your ingredients and vigilant with yourself with what you are doing. Don't absently add butter to your pan to sauté veggies (the dairy sensitive can't have butter).

Choose a bottle to use for your infused oil.,
Decide which herbs you want to use.,
Wash the herbs and dry them thoroughly.,
Combine the herbs and olive oil.,
Seal the bottle and store it in a cool, dry place for 1 week.,
Finished.








",How to Infuse Olive Oil,"









Find a bottle with a tight cover.
Bottles with a cork stopper work best. Metal lids can rust over time and can even affect the taste of the olive oil.
Wash your bottles with soap and hot water and allow them to dry completely before use by placing them in the sun or leaving them out overnight. This allows all of the water to evaporate.;
,









Choose herbs based on your preference and how you plan to use the oil. Suggestions include: thyme, rosemary, sage, basil and oregano.
You can use dried or fresh herbs, but you will need to take the extra step of drying fresh herbs to prevent bacteria growth in the olive oil.
Oils are usually infused with one type of herb, but flavors can be blended to your own preference.

,









You can dry the herbs by leaving them in the sun for several hours. Fresh herbs can also be dried by spreading them out on a cookie sheet and heating them in the oven for a few minutes on low heat.
Herbs should be completely dried before using them in the olive oil to keep bacteria from forming within the oil bottle. Although bacteria will not usually form in plain olive oil, it can appear if there is water present, such as the water in fresh herbs and in garlic.

,









This can be done by placing the dried herbs in the bottom of the bottle. Use a funnel and pour the oil over the herbs, filling the bottle close to the top.
Another way to combine the herbs and oil is to heat the oil and herbs on a stove top. This will infuse the flavor of the herbs quickly and can prevent bacteria growth. Strain the herbs from the oil for a clear look.

,









The oil will quickly pick up the flavor of the herbs and will intensify over time.
You should store your infused olive oil in the refrigerator and use it within a week if you're using fresh herbs or flavorings such as garlic, lemon or peppers.
You can keep infused oil longer if you use dried herbs. This can be from several weeks to a few months, but discard the mixture immediately if they spoil.

Do not put everything in whole, though., If the food processor has a low and fast speed, run it on the faster speed. You may need to stop the machine periodically to push larger chunks down toward the blades so that they chop better. Continue pulsing the food processor until all the vegetables and fruits look thoroughly shredded and diced., Depending on how high the juicer's collection spout is, you may need to change out containers throughout the juicing process once they become full., Use a masticating juicer, rather than a centrifugal juicer, since a masticating juicer will be able to crush the juice out of tiny pieces., Collect the juice in the same container used to collect the vegetable blend juice., Alternate between the two piles as you work, using about 1 cup (250 ml) of each until all the vegetable blend and all the broccoli sprouts have been juiced., You can do this by feeding the entire lemon half through the juicer.

Touch and feel around the entire mango.,
Inspect the mango visually.,
Smell mangoes near their stems.,
Look at color last.,
Learn about the varieties of different mangoes.",How to Pick a Good Mango1," Ripe mangoes will be slightly soft to the touch just like avocados and peaches, but not soft or mushy enough to where your fingers sink into or through the skin.


On the other hand, if you do not plan on eating the mango for a few days, you may want to choose a mango with firmer skin and allow the mango to ripen some at home. Ripening mangoes is discussed the a method below.;
, The ideal mango should be football-shaped, so you should choose mangoes that are full, plump and rounded, especially around the stem. Sometimes ripe mangoes will have brown spots or speckles, which is perfectly normal.


Do not pick flat or thin mangoes because they are likely to be stringy. Avoid choosing mangoes with wrinkled or shriveled skin because they will no longer be ripe.
Ataulfo mangoes, however, are often very wrinkly and soft before they're perfectly ripe, so try to learn about the different varieties before deciding. The differences are covered below in a subsequent section.

, Ripe mangoes will always have a strong, sweet, fragrant and fruity aroma around the stem. A ripe mango has a smell somewhat like melon, but also like pineapple, with a little hint of carrot thrown in. Ripe mangoes smell wonderful and sweet. If it smells like you'd want to eat it, you're in business.


Since mangoes have a high natural sugar content, they will ferment naturally, so the sour, alcoholic odor is a distinctive sign the mango is no longer ripe. Stay away from mangoes that smell sour or like alcohol because these mangoes may be overripe., In general, the color of mangoes is not the best way to look for ripeness. Since the colors of ripe mangoes can be bright yellow, green, pink, or red depending on the variety and season, color alone won't necessarily tell you much about the ripeness of a mango. Instead, familiarize yourself with the different varieties of mangoes and the seasons in which they thrive to learn more about what you're looking for.

, Since mangoes have different colors and slightly different flavors depending on the current season and the region they come from, you may want to learn how to identify certain types of mangoes to heighten your overall experience with them. There are 6 different types of mangoes.

Use edible garnishes whenever possible.,
Make all inedible garnishes easily identifiable and removable.,
Decide whether to use strong flavors or bland ones.,
Vary the color and texture.,
Arrange the garnish on the dish.,
Keep the temperature in mind.",How to Garnish Food1," Garnishes are not only for decoration; they can add new flavors and textures to the meal as well. Using edible garnish also avoids the hassle of having to remove the garnish before eating.;
, Cocktail umbrellas and birthday candles are common examples of inedible garnishes that are difficult to replace with edible material. However, these items are obviously inedible and easily removed from the food, so there is little chance of anyone eating them. Make sure any other inedible ingredients you use share these characteristics.

, Bland dishes may call for garnishes sprinkled with herbs or spices, but every garnish doesn't need to have a strong taste. If the food already has a complex flavor, it's usually a good idea to avoid flavorful garnishes which could clash with other ingredients., Pick a color that contrasts with the color of the dish, so the garnish is more visible and appealing. Similarly, a small piece of a crunchy vegetable adds variety and interest to a soft dish.


Two-ingredient garnishes can be laid out in alternating layers on a plate, creating a contrast between two colors. Try slices of tomatoes and cucumbers, or two different colors of gelatin cubes.

, Garnish may catch the diners' eye more readily on a contrasting background. If the food itself contains several colors, place the garnish directly on the plate or bowl. Most garnishes show up well on white tableware, but bright-colored garnishes may work well on a dark ceramic dish as well.


Remember that the garnish is usually there to accentuate the main dish, not become an art project unto itself. Two or three pieces of garnish arranged at intervals may be more attractive than a continuous border or a large pile., Frozen garnishes may melt if placed next to hot food. Even if not in danger of losing its shape, a large, cold garnish may be unpleasant to eat with a hot soup, and a hot garnish likely won't pair well with a cold dessert."

Serving sizes differ on each food label and may not equal the serving size you normally eat. If you eat twice the serving listed on the label, you will need to double all the numbers in the nutritional facts section.;
, This section on the label tells you the total number of calories in each serving of the food and the number of those calories which are derived from fat. Calories provide a measure of how much energy you get from eating one serving of the food. If you are trying to manage (lose, gain or maintain) your weight, the number of calories you consume counts. For example, one serving of macaroni and cheese may provide 250 calories, with 110 calories from fat. If you ate 2 servings, you would consume 500 calories and 220 of those calories would be from fat.

, Total fat includes fats that are good for you, such as monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and omega-3 fats (usually from liquid and plant sources, such as canola oil and nuts) and fats that are not so good, such as saturated and trans fats (from animal or vegetable sources). Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats can help lower your blood cholesterol and protect your heart. Trans fats are also known as ""hydrogenated"" and ""partially hydrogenated"" fats. These are formed during the process of converting liquid oils into solid fats, such as shortening and stick margarine. Hydrogenation increases the shelf life and stabilizes the flavor of these fats. Partially hydrogenated fats are currently considered the worst fats for our health.

, Sodium is also known as table salt and it is a hidden ingredient in many foods, especially processed food, such as canned soups and tomato sauces.

, This tells you how much cholesterol you get from eating one serving of the food. There are two types of cholesterol - HDL, known as the ""good"" cholesterol and LDL, the ""bad"" cholesterol.

, This number represents the total of all the different types of carbohydrates you consume from eating one serving of the food.

, This number tells you how many grams of dietary fiber is in one serving of the food. Dietary Fiber is the indigestible portion of plant food.

, This is the amount of sugar you consume if you consume one serving of the food. Some carbohydrates become sugar when digested in your body, so you may be consuming more sugar than what is on the label.

, This number tells you how much protein you obtain from consuming one serving of the food.

However, the information is dietary advice from public health experts for all Americans and is the same for all products. This is applicable also in many other countries, following dietary advice provided by individual an country's food advisory experts. It shows the upper and lower limits for each nutrient based on a 2,000-calorie diet. Let's use the macaroni and cheese example. One serving would provide 18% of the Daily Value of the possible 100% Daily Value for your total fat intake. That leaves 82% that you could consume from other sources for that day. If you ate two servings, you would consume 36% of your Daily Value for fat, leaving 64% to be consumed from other sources.

Ataulfos are ripe when their skin turns deep gold and may develop small wrinkles when they are fully ripe. Ataulfos come from Mexico and are usually available from March through July., Francis mangoes have bright yellow skin with green overtones and are usually oblong or shaped like the letter S. Francis mangoes are ripe when their green overtones fade away and the yellow hues become more golden. Francis mangoes are grown on small farms throughout Haiti and are usually available from May through July.

, Haden mangoes are bright red with green and yellow overtones and small white dots. Haden mangoes are usually medium or large with oval or round shapes and are ripe when the green overtones begin changing to yellow. Haden mangoes are from Mexico and are only available during April and May.

, Keitts are oval-shaped and medium to dark green with a pink blush. The skin of Keitt mangoes will remain green even when they are ripe. Keitt mangoes are grown in both Mexico and the United States and are usually available in August and September.

, Kent mangoes come in large, oval shapes and are dark green with a dark red blush. Kent mangoes are ripe when yellow overtones or dots begin to spread over the skin of the mango. Kent mangoes come from Mexico, Peru, and Ecuador and are available from January to March and June to August.

, Tommy Atkins mangoes will have a dark red blush with some green, orange, and yellow accents and are oblong or oval-shaped. The only way to test the ripeness of Tommy Atkins mangoes are to feel them, since their color will not change. Tommy Atkins mangoes are grown in Mexico and other regions in South America and are available from March to July and from October to January.

Harvest mangoes about 100 to 150 days after flowering.,
Watch for the mangoes to change color.,
Shake or thrash the tree.,
Use a fruit picking basket, or improvise one.",How to Pick a Good Mango3," For most varieties of mango, each blossom you see on a healthy tree will produce fruit. You'll see dark green fruit start to form and gradually grow in size over the next three months. Start checking the tree around the 90 day mark to see if they're starting to ripen.

, Somewhere around the three month mark, the mangoes will start to change color to their ripened shade and become somewhat soft. You may also notice some mangoes falling off around the ground. These are signs the mangoes are ready to start being picked.


When you see some that are ripe, all of the other fruit that are roughly the same size are fine to also pick, as they'll be at their peak of ripeness in a day or two, left on the counter. If you plan on selling them at a market, it's probably better to pick them a little early.Fruit-ripened mangoes are much better than mangoes picked green and allowed to ripen indoors. Do what's best and most convenient, but if you can, try to let them become as ripe as possible on the tree before picking them. You'll never taste such a delicious mango.

, The easiest and most simple way to get at those high mangoes is to shake the tree and pick them up, or catch as many as possible. If you're brave, you can stand under the branches with big fruit baskets and try to catch them as they fall to avoid bruising, but it's usually a better idea to pick them up off the grass, where they'll probably fall just as softly.


When a few start falling by themselves, they're probably ready to be harvested, and maybe even overripe. You don't have to wait for them to fall to the ground by themselves before you start picking them.
Young or brittle trees should not be shaken, but the branches should instead be thrashed with lengths of rope, or long wooden dowels. If you're concerned about the thickness of the tree trunk, don't shake it.

, Because mangoes are such a delicate fruit when ripe, some pickers prefer to get at the mangoes in a more sophisticated way, by using a picking basket. Essentially, this is a long pole with a metal claw on the end, perfect for getting high tree fruit like apples, pears, plums, and mangoes. Use the rake tips to coax each mango off the tree and drop into the basket gently. It's a very effective way of getting to high fruit and if you've got a lot of fruit to pick, these make a great investment. They're commonly available at seed suppliers and rural outfitters, though you can also improvise one yourself with the right tools.


Buy the longest, lightest dowel you can find (or of a length appropriate to match the tree). Use a small metal bucket, the like of which is used for golf balls or gardening supplies, and use duct tape to attach it to the end of the dowel. To create a nice claw for picking, take the head off of a metal rake and attach the spines to the lip of the bucket.

Leave on the counter in cool temperature.,
Refrigerate when the mango reaches the desired ripeness.,
Rinse the outside of the mango before slicing.,
Cut to the side of the stone.,
Cut cross-hatches into the flesh of each side.,
Pop the skin backward and cut out the chunks.",How to Pick a Good Mango4," If your mango isn't quite ripe, leave it out on the counter in relatively cool room temperature for a few days to ripen some. For most mangoes, between two and four days is usually enough time to soften and become ready to eat.Mangoes that were picked especially green will sometimes take much longer, and in fact may never ripen like you want them to. If a mango hasn't ripened in five or seven days, it's probably not going to get any riper.
In hotter temperatures, mangoes will ripen more quickly, and may go from green to overripe in a very short amount of time. If it's hot and you're not in some temperature-controlled air conditioning, keep a close eye on them. They'll probably be fine.

, After your mango softens, it's fine to put it in the fridge if you want to keep it at it's peak of ripeness for a couple of days before you want to eat it. It's also great to chill mangoes, because a cold mango is a delicious treat.


In the fridge, the cold will slow the ripening process, so the fruit won't ripen any longer and will last for up to 4 days longer than they will on the counter, where they'll continue ripening. You don't have to refrigerate them, however, if you want to eat them quickly.

, While most people choose to not eat the mango skin, because it has a bitter flavor and a stringy texture, it's still a good idea to rinse mangoes on the outside before slicing into them, especially mangoes you've purchased at the store. Traces of chemicals, germs, and other gunk can work its way onto the fruit in the grocery store, making it a good idea to rinse them off, rub them thoroughly with your hands, and prepare a clean surface on which to slice them up.Mango skin is perfectly edible and in fact extremely high in compounds that help control receptor molecules called PPARs, which help to regulate cholesterol, glucose, and are thought to have some anti-cancer properties.Give it a rinse and give it a try!
If you want to try the skin, you can just eat the mango whole like an apple, or you can peel it and go right at the fruit, eating your way around it.

, The best way to slice up a mango is to hold it upright on the small end, with the stem end facing toward the ceiling. Run a sharp kitchen knife into the flesh just to the side of the stem, cutting alongside the pit on the inside. You should feel something hard that will push your knife off to the side. That means you're doing it perfectly. Do the same thing on the other side of the stem, then trim off the extra flesh on the two sides of the fruit.


You should be left with a furry-ish stone that still probably has a lot of fruit on it. Chef's rights: you get to chew off that bit.

, One of the cleanest ways to get the fruit out of the skin at this point is to use your knife and run it through the inside of the flesh, cutting a cross-hatch pattern in the fruit. Depending on the size of the mango, you might want to cut chunks anywhere from a 1/2 in. to an inch.


It's best to do this while the fruit is sitting on a cutting board, even though it might be easier to hold the skin in your hand. It's very easy to cut straight through the skin and poke into your hand, which can result in a nasty cut.

, Once you've hatched up the fruit, push on the skin-side to pop the fruit chunks out and up and make them easy to cut off the skin. Slice them off carefully into a bowl, or bite them off like candy. Enjoy!

Learn about dangerous mushrooms.",How to Pick Mushrooms," When you positively identify a mushroom, put it in your edible mushrooms basket. If you pick a mushroom but don’t know what it is or feel unsure about its identity, put it in the other basket., Because people often confuse mushrooms at the button stage, you should stick to picking mushrooms that have opened caps., You want to pick the edible mushrooms when they look fresh and fleshy. Cut them two inches above the ground. Put them in a basket. When you get home, put them in a closed paper bag in the refrigerator.

If they look old or decaying, leave them in the ground.
They should store for a week at home.
Be sure to dig your mushroom out in a way that leaves the base of the stalk undamaged! Do not pull it up. Replace the soil when you are done. Some mushrooms have important features, such as an easily destroyed sac, at the base of the stipe.

, If you have any doubts at all about a mushroom that you have picked in the wild, toss it! Give yourself some time to learn the nuances of mushroom picking. After all, it’s not worth risking your life for a delicious meal. You are better off being cautious when it comes to eating mushrooms that you have foraged in the wild.“When in doubt, throw it out!”
If the mushroom looks good but there is something that bothers you about where you picked it, it’s not worth taking the chance!

, You may hear a number of misleading rules of thumb from people who like to hunt for wild mushrooms. However, there are no easy shortcuts to proper mushroom identification. As such, ignore the following rules of thumb:

“If an animal has nibbled the mushroom, it is fine.” This is not true.
“You can get rid of poisons by cooking the mushrooms.” This is also false. Although cooking will get rid of harmful bacteria and make edible mushrooms much more digestible, you can’t make a poisonous mushroom edible by cooking it!
“Mushrooms that smell good must be edible.” This is simply not true.

, Mushrooms should be carried in paper bags or waxed paper, preferably in a rigid container. Smaller mushrooms can be kept intact by carrying them in a small, hard box. Some tackle boxes used for holding fishing flies are ideal for this purpose!


Plastic sandwich bags will turn them to unidentifiable mush.

, Kneel down next to the mushroom you wish to identify. Put your nose right next to the gills of the mushroom and inhale deeply. Think of a few adjectives to describe the smell, such as sweet or smokey, and use these adjectives to start the identification process.How does your mushroom smell?
Does the mushroom smell generically fungal or phenolic?
Don’t taste the mushroom until you have finished the complete identification process.

, Look at the gills on the underside of the mushroom to see whether they are clearly delineated or mushy looking. You’ll also want to look at how they connect to the stalk. The texture is also important to consider, as well as whether any liquid oozes from the gills. By asking yourself questions about the gills, you can begin the identification process:Are the gills covered by a veil of thin, felt-like, or cobwebby tissue?
See if the gills are connected to the stalk. If so, do they run down the stalk, meet it at a right angle, or barely touch it? This character, like color, can change in age!
Does your mushroom have plate-like gills under the cap surface, wrinkles, spongy tubes, or something else?
Do you see liquid oozing from the gills?

, You’ll need to take mental notes about the size, color and shape of the stalk. You’ll want to look at any characteristics of the skin covering the stalk, as well as the connection between the stalk and the gills.

Look at the size, color and shape of the stalk.
Is a stalk (stipe) present or absent?

, You’ll want to take detailed notes about the size of the cap. Then, describe any variation in the color of the cap, as well as whether there are any spots on it. Finally, the texture of the cap is important to consider, such as whether it is smooth or slimey.Ask key questions about the cap:

What is the diameter of the mushroom cap?
Are there colorful spots on the cap?
Look at the color of the cap.
What color is the flesh inside the cap?
Does your mushroom bruise when cut or crushed? What color?

, Take out your notebook. Look at your surroundings. Take detailed notes about your find in relation to the features of the landscape, such as trees, soil type, forest, other fungi, leaves, animals. These notes will help you make an accurate identification.A GPS locator is an excellent tool here!
Is the mushroom growing on dead wood, living tree, soil, moss, or something else entirely?
While fungi can form associations with many plants, trees are the most relevant to identification. If you can't tell the species of tree exactly, at least note whether conifers, hardwoods, or both are present. Which trees are present in the area?
Make a note if your mushroom is growing in a lawn, on sand, on moss, on another mushroom, or any other site of interest.

, Try to get a few angles and include some of the surrounding landscape in some of the shots. When you are identifying the mushroom and consulting experts, you can compare your shots to the field guide. You can also show them to experts in order to confirm your identification.

, Because the color of a mushroom’s spores is useful for identification, you could make a spore print at home. Cut off the stem of the mushroom and place the cap down on a piece of paper. Place a cup over the mushroom. Wait overnight and then remove the cup and the mushroom to see the spore print. If the mushroom is dropping spores, you will see them dusting the paper, allowing you to determine their color.If you anticipate a dark spore print, you should use white paper.
If you anticipate a white or light spore print, you should use dark paper.
If you have a sheet of glass, you can use it for the spore print.
The terms for spore color can be very precise. Chocolate brown, tobacco brown, and rusty brown are entirely different colors!

, When you get back to the picnic table or kitchen, look at the mushroom again. Use one book to identify it. Then, identify the mushroom using a second source, such as another book or article on the species., Although you may be eager to apply your mycological knowledge in the field, you should avoid jumping to any conclusions during the identification process. If you think it is an edible mushroom, examine all of its characteristics to make sure it is not a toxic look-alike.For example, Volvariella speciosa, a popular edible species in Asia, can be easily confused with Amanita phalloides, a deadly poisonous species in North America and Europe., If you see a mushroom that looks like the puffball mushrooms you are familiar with from the supermarket or television, you should skip it. Beginners are especially forewarned to avoid picking puffballs, since they can easily be confused with poisonous amanitas.The mushrooms that look most familiar to a beginner mycologist, such as puffballs, could easily be confused with a poisonous young amanita mushroom.You should also avoid the little brown mushroom, which is poisonous. It also looks a bit like the mushrooms you see in a supermarket.

, Whereas a morel is perfectly hollow inside, a false morel looks like a brain on the inside. Don’t let commonalities like the dimpled appearance and the fact that they fruit at the same time confuse you. If you pick a morel, look on the inside. If it is brain-like on the inside as well as the outside, it is a false morel. , The best way to differentiate a chanterelle mushroom, which is edible, from a jack-o’-lantern, which is poisonous, is to look at the gills. A chanterelle mushroom has fake gills that run down the stem and are not easily removed from the cap. They look like they have been melted. In contrast, a jack-o’-lantern has true gills that look like little blades that don’t run down the stem.A jack-o’-lantern or false chanterelle is deep orange. In contrast, a chanterelle mushroom can be anything from light yellow or orange yellow.
Whereas jack-o’-interns grow in bunches that are attached at the stem, chanterelles like to grow alone or in small bunches and with separate stems.

, One of the best ways to learn about picking wild mushrooms is to join a local mycological society. After joining, you will get invitations to forays at local parks where you can learn from experienced mushroom pickers. You may also get invited to special mushroom dinners and lectures on the science of mycology.

You will typically pay a small membership fee.
For instance, the Wisconsin mycology society has forays, lectures, dinners and workshops on mushrooms.The Mycological Society of Toronto runs forays in the spring and fall picking seasons, hosts dinners and runs lectures. It also has a quarterly newsletter called “Mycelium.” , Once you are a member of a mycological society, you will have access to mushroom identification courses.One of the best things you can do is take a day-long course that reviews the fundamentals of where to look for particular species, when to harvest different species and how to avoid poisonous look-alikes., The best way to learn how to pick mushrooms is by picking with an experienced mycologist. Go on a hike with someone who is both knowledgable and passionate about mushrooms. Pick their brain about how to safely forage for wild mushrooms.If you are part of a mycological society, you should be able to meet some fellow mushroom loving friends at one of the forays.

, You should pick up at least one general book on mycology and one field guide that focuses on your particular region. Whereas the general mycology book will review the fundamentals of mushroom picking, your field guide will offer tips that are specific to the place where you want to pick them.For instance, a good introduction is How to Identify Edible Mushrooms by Tony Lion and Gill Tomblin.

Mushrooms by Roger Phillips is a good place to start.
You might be interested in Mushrooms: River Cottage Handbook No 1.

, You can’t teach yourself to be a mycologist by just looking at a few images of edible mushrooms online. Rather than searching with the “images” function on your search engine, you should consult reputable books on mycology and ask experts for help with identification., To avoid picking the wrong mushroom, you should familiarize yourself with both poisonous and difficult to identify species. If you are a beginner, for instance, you should avoid picking lactarius and russula species. Read the notes in your field guide about the dangerous mushrooms in your region.Avoid poisonous species like amanita, galerina, entoloma and cortinarius.

Learn when to use fruit garnishes.,
Cut simple fruit squares.,
Create a strawberry fan.,
Cut a Maraschino cherry into a flower shape.,
Create sugared fruit garnishments.,
Make an apple swan.",How to Garnish Food2," Most fruits are sweet, and best used to decorate desserts, or salads when used in small quantities. Citrus fruits, such as lemons and limes, are excellent for adding color and flavor to dishes containing fish and lightly flavored meat, as well as other fruits and desserts.


Citrus fruits can be made into attractive garnish simply by cutting them into thin circles, wedges, or twists. See below for advice on preparing other fruit.

, Choose a firm fruit with segments or a varied internal appearance, such as an orange or kiwi. Cut out a rectangular block from the center of the fruit, then slice this into flat squares.Use several fruits of different colors for variety. Some of these can be fruits with a plainer appearance, such as cantaloupe or mango, cut into squares or scooped out into spheres with a melon baller.

, Wash and dry a strawberry. Using a paring knife, make four or five slices from the tip of the strawberry toward the top, but leave a small piece around the stem intact. Gently fan out the slices of the strawberry on the plate you wish to decorate.

, Cut a cherry two-thirds of the way through the fruit. Turn the cherry and make two more cuts, dividing the cherry into six ""petals"" without cutting them apart from each other. Spread the petals carefully apart and press them flat.Optionally, add a small piece of candied fruit or other edible material to the center, and place one or two mint leaves underneath it.

, Wash any firm fruit, then blot dry with a paper towel. Separate an egg white into a bowl and beat it until it becomes foamy. Brush the egg white onto the fruit in a thin, even coat, then sprinkle with white granulated sugar for a frosted appearance., If you have a little more time and a sharp knife, try making a swan design out of an apple, as described in the linked article. Large radishes or other hard, large fruit or vegetables can be used instead.


Other complex designs can serve as centerpieces or garnishes for special occasions. You can find many of these online by searching for Thai fruit carving instructions, or for ""food art.""

Use these ingredients for savory dishes.,
Create a flower from a carrot or cucumber.,
Craft a tomato rose.,
Link a chain of vegetable rings.,
Use food coloring to create an onion garnish.,
Choose edible flowers.,
Use a sprig of herbs.",How to Garnish Food3," Vegetables and flowers make excellent garnishes for salad, meat, vegetable dishes, pasta, and rice. If you're not sure which vegetable or flower to use, pick one that was used as an ingredient in the food, or go with a mild-tasting vegetable such as cucumber or daikon radish.

, Wash half of a cucumber or carrot, and peel off any dirty or bumpy skin. Use a paring knife to cut a strip down the length of the vegetable, but don't cut it off entirely. Repeat to form a series of ""petals"" around the carrot or cucumber. If there's room, make a second, inner layer of petals the same way. Remove the thick inner portion, and gently bend the petals outward., Peel a tomato skin in one long, spiral strip from one end to another, making the strip narrower and narrower as you go. Curl this strip of skin into a tight curl, then release it to form a flower shape.You may need to tuck the narrow end in between two folds of the spiral to keep it in place, or use a toothpick to fasten it more firmly.

, White onions, all bell peppers, and even hollowed-out cucumbers can easily be cut into rings. Make these fancier by cutting a slit into each ring, and forming an interlocking chain to place on top of the food or around the serving dish., Slice a white onion into segments, but leave the root at the base to keep them together. Dip the onion in hot water to make it firm and reduce the onion scent, then soak it in food coloring for twenty or thirty minutes so it develops an attractive, muted color., Violets, roses, geraniums, marigolds, and nasturtiums are all examples of edible flowers, but look up other flowers before you add them to food, since some flowers are toxic. Never eat flowers grown near roads or other sources of pollution, flowers that have had pesticides used on them, or flowers of unidentified species. Only some flowers are edible, and even those should be used sparingly to avoid causing digestive issues.All that said, a flower blossom is simultaneously one of the easiest and most attractive garnishes available.


The taste of a flower can change with variety, time of year, and the environment it was planted in. Taste a petal before you use it as garnish, even if you've eaten that species of flower before.

, One of the simplest and most common garnishes is a sprig of parsley. This is a great addition to dishes with rich, meaty or heavy flavors, as it balances it out with a lighter, more natural ingredient. You can also use rosemary leaves, mint, or other herbs, but remember to remove inedible stems first.


Sometimes, a sprinkle of ground herbs or spices is all a dish needs. Paprika, chili powder, and turmeric are all brightly colored enough to serve as garnishes by themselves.

Use drizzled chocolate to make shapes.,
Dip fruit in chocolate.,
Sugar coat edible flowers.,
Use colored gelatin in molds.",How to Garnish Food4," You can drizzle zig zags straight onto desserts or plates, using melted chocolate or chocolate syrup. For more complicated designs, try piping melted chocolate onto a baking sheet lined with waxed paper. Transfer the sheet carefully to the refrigerator or freezer for about ten minutes, or until the chocolate is cold and solidified.Prop these designs vertically in ice cream or lay them flat onto any cold dessert, immediately before serving.


Use dark, white, and milk chocolate to create a varied appearance.

, Strawberries, grapes, or cubes of any fruit can be dipped in chocolate and chilled to harden into a delicious dessert in their own right. Stick them onto skewers and arrange them in a fan shape by sticking the other end of the skewer into a halved melon containing fruit salad or another dessert.

, Use an edible flower grown without pesticides, preferably one with a pleasant scent. Whip an egg white until it foams, then use a brush to coat the flower. Sprinkle white granulated sugar over the flower, and use sparingly as a topping for rice pudding or other desserts.

, Any flavored liquid can be mixed with gelatin powder, from herbal tea to fruit juice. Heat according to the instructions on the gelatin packaging, then pour into molds and chill until the gelatin sets. If you don't have any decorative molds, cut the gelatin manually into cubes, diamonds, or other shapes.


You can even use soup stock or savory herbs in water to create savory gelatin.

Let your kids pick out lunchboxes or bags.,
Have your kids help you shop.,
Prep lunch items with your kids.,
Create a lunch packing station with your kids.",How to Get Kids to Help Pack Their Lunches1," Your children will be more excited to bring their lunch to school if they have a lunchbox or lunch bag that has a design they like on it. For example, your children might choose one with a favorite cartoon character.You should also consider buying lunch boxes with built in dividers. Many children do not like their food mixed up, and these lunchbox compartments will also make packing lunch easier for your kids.;
, When making your shopping list, ask your kids to contribute. You might ask them to choose a vegetable, fruit, and so on to add to your shopping list. When your kids feel like they had an active part in lunchtime decisions, they'll be more likely to want to continue helping by packing their own lunch.


When shopping, you can continue this involvement by having your kids help you find items as you shop., Some foods, like vegetables, may need to be cut into smaller pieces before putting them in a plastic baggie for lunch. Do prep work with your kids ahead of time so that they can grab these prepared items and assemble their lunches quickly and easily.You can pre-cut items, like vegetables, fruits, and so on, then put them in re-sealable containers. Store these in your fridge for lunches throughout the week.

, When kids are given something, they often become possessive of it. Use this to your advantage, and make a lunch packing station for your kids to make them more invested in making their own lunch. Some ideas for a lunch packing station include:Allocating some cabinet space for your kids' snacks. For younger kids, you may want to put these in easily accessible containers (like open-topped baskets) on easy to reach shelves.
Using a separate shelf for lunchboxes and clean plastic containers. This way, your kids always know where to store and find their lunchbox and plastic containers.

Use safe labeling techniques to differentiate shelf space between kids, to designate lunch boxes, plastic containers, and so on.
You can also turn this into a craft and get your kids involved by allowing them to add personal decorations (within reason) to their lunch packing station.

Decide on a game or challenge.,
Add special limits or conditions to keep things interesting.,
Award points and encourage your kids' progress.,
Encourage healthy competition among your kids.",How to Get Kids to Help Pack Their Lunches2," There are many different games you might use so that lunch making is more enjoyable for your kids. You could have a time attack game, where every day your kids try to make their lunch as quickly as possible. You might also:


Use ""lunch goals."" For example, for one week, you might set the lunch goal of ""making a healthy lunch"" or ""making the most delicious sandwich.""
Create a challenge where you tell your kids what ingredients they can use. Then have them create their own lunch from those ingredients.

, This is also an effective technique for coaching good habits, like time management and cleanliness, in your kids. If you have less time than usual, you might add the special limit of, ""all lunches must be made in less than 10 minutes."" If you've noticed your kids haven't been cleaning up after themselves, you might add the condition, ""the kitchen must be clean after making lunch.""


By calling these ""limits"" and ""conditions,"" or giving them a special name, it'll sound less like you're telling your kids what to do, which may make them more willing to participate.An example of a special name you might use for a time limit could be ""The Final Countdown."" You could even play the song ""The Final Countdown,"" which contains these lyrics, during the time limit to make it more fun.

, Most games or challenges involve completing activities to win points. These points don't have to be exchanged for anything special, like a prize, but can be a useful way of tracking progress.


When you notice your kids doing especially well and earning many points, tell them what a great job they're doing.
You can award points any way you see fit. For example, you might award one point for packing veggies, one point for fruit, one point for a sandwich, one point for cleaning up, and so on.
You may want to make a point chart, so your kids can see their progress. Hang this chart somewhere visible, and mark points earned each day., A little bit of competition might be just the thing to engage your kids in their lunch making. Beyond that, competition will likely lead to the job getting done faster. Do this by praising the efforts of your kids as they learn and develop good lunch packing habits.


Involve your kids in their own lunch making improvement by asking questions like, ""how do you think you could pack your lunch better?"" or ""is there anything that would help you make your lunches more easily?""
Be sure to focus your praise on the applied effort of your children, on their work ethic, on their improvement in certain areas, and so on. This will help prevent children who are lower performers from feeling like they are not as good as higher performers."

Establish clear, firm limits for rewards.,
Have your kids earn privileges through lunch packing.,
Set weekly and monthly rewards.,
Set up a calendar or progress board somewhere visible.",How to Get Kids to Help Pack Their Lunches3," Make sure you kids know exactly what the consequences are for not packing their lunch. For instance, you could institute a ""three strikes rule,"" where if they don't pack their lunch three times in a week, they lose privileges.Be firm with your limits for rewards. Even if your kids beg or throw a tantrum, calmly remind them of the rules and their decision to not follow them. Stick to your limits.

, This is a great skill for kids to learn even at a young age. Privileges, like TV time, video game time, and even sports, cost money. Even though your kids can't contribute money, they can help out by packing their own lunches. Some privileges you might have your children earn through lunch packing include:


Doing a hobby (like chess, music, model building, etc.)
Participating in sports
Playing tabletop games (like board games or cards)
Playing video games
Playing with friends
Watching TV, This is good way to encourage consistency in your kids. By setting a weekly or monthly reward for not missing a day of lunch packing, you'll encourage your kids to pack their lunches every day. Some ideas for weekly and monthly rewards include:


A favorite dinner or desert
A new video game
A new book
A small party with friends
A trip to the movie theatre

, Many children respond well to visual confirmation of their progress. Display a calendar or progress board on a visible surface, like on your refrigerator or a prominent wall.


You may want to use a special colored felt tipped marker, stickers, stamps, or some other similar marker to indicate on your calendar or progress chart when your kids have completed their lunch making responsibility.
By using a calendar or progress chart, your children will not only be reminded of their lunch making responsibility, but they'll also see the direct correlation between their efforts and their progress.

, Set the stems aside to prepare and freeze separately.

, How you chop it will depend upon your preference for preparing it.


Ribbon it by rolling the leaves vertically. Slice horizontally against the rolled leaves in 1-inch (2.5 cm) strips.
Chop the leaves like you would spinach. Stack the leaves on top of each other. Slice them 2 times vertically. Stack them again and slice them 3 to 6 times horizontally, depending upon the size of the leaves.
Slice them in half or into fourths, if you like larger sized leaves.

, Use a stockpot instead of a saucepan to ensure you have enough space for even blanching.


Blanching halts enzyme production. It stops the plants from ripening for several days to several weeks. It is recommended to preserve nutrient content for all leafy greens if you can’t use them within two days.

Use frozen bread in a timely manner.",How to Defrost Bread," If you're only going to use a portion of your sliced bread, it's best to defrost that portion only. Thawing out an entire loaf of sliced bread when you only need a few slices will require you to either consume the rest of the loaf or refreeze it.Refreezing bread repeatedly can dry the bread out, making it hard and/or stale.Set aside as many slices as you'll need to defrost and save the rest in the freezer.
If the slices are stuck together, you can try using a clean fork or knife to gently pry them apart.;
, Take the slices you've chosen to defrost and arrange them on a plate.Most permanent kitchen dinnerware is safe to microwave; if you're not sure, check the bottom of the plate, as manufacturers will stamp some kitchenware as being microwave safe.


Do not cover the bread. Simply arrange your slices on a plate with a little space in between each slice.
Some bakers recommend wrapping frozen bread in a paper towel before microwaving.Make sure the plate can safely be microwaved.
Avoid using disposable plates or anything made of plastic.

, While most loaves of bread will not defrost well in the microwave, sliced bread can be microwaved effectively. As the bread thaws, the starch molecules in each slice will form crystals, which can draw out any moisture that was previously in the bread (called retrogradation). Using a microwave allows the crystals to break down inside the slices of bread so that each piece is soft and warm.Set the microwave on high power.
Heat the sliced bread in your microwave for increments of 10 seconds. Check on the slices after 10 seconds before adding more time in the microwave.It should not take more than 15 to 25 seconds for most microwaves to defrost sliced bread. However, there may be some variance in defrost time, depending on your particular microwave.
Do not microwave bread for longer than a minute, as this will probably overheat it.Make sure the bread isn't too hot before eating.
Be aware that microwaving bread is likely to make it either overly chewy or hard and stale. This is because the bread loses its water content as the microwave turns that water into vapor, which leaves the bread., If you don't have a microwave or would rather not use one, you can defrost frozen bread in a toaster oven. This method may not work well for whole loaves of bread, though, so it's best to only use toaster ovens for slices of bread.Adjust the setting to ""defrost"" or ""frozen"" to warm up sliced bread from the freezer.
As always, make sure the bread hasn't gotten too hot while toasting.

, If you don't have access to an oven or simply don't need the bread right away, you can let it thaw at room temperature.The time it takes to defrost will vary, depending on the size and thickness of the loaf. You can check the inside by cutting off a slice once it seems like it's finished defrosting, or gently squeeze the loaf to see how soft it is.


Take the frozen loaf out of the freezer.
Leave the loaf in the freezer bag and set it out on the kitchen counter.
At room temperature, it can take up to three or four hours for a loaf of bread to fully defrost.
When it's ready, it will be thawed out but may not be very warm. The crust may also lose its crispness, and if the bread was very moist it could become soggy or stale.
Defrosting the bread in an oven is considered a superior method by many bakers.

, Using an oven is much quicker and more efficient than thawing at room temperature. It will also give you a nice, warm loaf that will taste and feel like it's just been freshly baked.Pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (about 175 degrees Celsius).
Take the bread out of the freezer and remove any plastic bags and other wrappings it may have been stored in.
Put the still-frozen loaf on the middle rack of the oven.
Set a timer for 40 minutes. This should be enough time for the bread to thaw and warm from crust to center.
Remove the loaf from the oven and let it sit on the counter for a few minutes until it cools to room temperature.

, Whether you've defrosted your bread at room temperature or in an oven, you may find yourself left with a stale or crusty loaf of bread. Do not worry, though, as this bread can easily be brought back to its previous crisp, delicious condition.Get the loaf only mildly wet with clean, cold water. You can briefly swipe the loaf under a running tap, or wet a clean paper towel and dab the loaf until it is dampened.
Wrap the damp loaf of bread in aluminum foil. Make sure the aluminum foil is wrapped tightly to ensure that no moisture escapes.
Set the wrapped loaf on the middle rack in the oven. Make sure the oven hasn't been preheated, as you want the bread to warm gradually.
Set the oven's temperature to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (about 150 degrees Celsius).
Smaller loaves (like baguettes and rolls) should be finished in about 15 to 20 minutes, while larger, thicker loaves may take upwards of 30 minutes.
Take out the loaf, unwrap the foil, and put the unwrapped loaf back in the oven for an additional five minutes for a perfect crust.
Be aware that this method will only make a stale loaf soft for a few hours or less. Try to eat your bread within that time frame or it may get crusty and stale again.

, Whether a humid day has ruined your crust or the freezing process has left you with an undesirable crust, you can easily restore the crust back to its former condition with just a few minutes in the oven. Keep a close eye on the bread so it doesn't burn and it should be back to a delicious, crisp loaf in no time.Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).
Unwrap the thawed-out loaf of bread and set it in the oven. Putting the bread directly on the oven rack will give you a crisper crust, but you can use a baking sheet if you prefer.
Set a timer for five minutes, and let the loaf heat up inside the oven.
After five minutes, promptly remove the loaf from the oven and let it sit at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes before you attempt to cut the bread. Cutting the bread while it's too warm can make it difficult to get a clean slice.

, Bakery and sliced/packaged bread will both keep in the freezer for similar time frames. However, freezing bread after the expiration date has passed can negatively impact the quality of the bread. If you've been refrigerating your bread, it may not be in good enough shape to freeze it once you reach the expiration date.Bakery bread is typically good for two or three days after the printed expiration date if stored in the pantry, but expired bread that's been refrigerated will not last.
Packaged (sliced) bread can be good for up to seven days past the expiration date if kept in the pantry, but if refrigerated it should not be eaten past the printed date.
Properly stored and frozen bread, whether from a bakery or packaged,should keep for up to six months in the freezer.

, Freezer bags tend to be made with slightly thicker plastic than regular sandwich or storage bags, and they are designed to help prevent freezer burn. Using high-quality freezer bags can help ensure that your bread stays as fresh as possible.You can purchase freezer bags at most grocery stores.

Put the loaf inside a freezer bag. Squeeze out any air inside the bag and wrap it tightly before sealing the bag.
Take the wrapped and sealed loaf and place it inside a second freezer bag. Double bagging the loaf will help minimize any decline in quality., The best way to ensure your bread is as fresh as possible when you defrost it is by making sure you freeze it properly. With proper temperature and storage conditions, your bread should emerge from the freezer in good condition.Try to freeze the loaf as soon after you've purchased it as possible to ensure that the bread does not become moldy, soggy, or stale before you freeze it.
Make sure your freezer is set to 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) to ensure that the bread stays as cold as possible to prevent decay.
Write the freezing date on the bag so you know how long it's been in the freezer. If you freeze multiple loaves of bread, put the freshest ones in the back so that the older loaves get eaten sooner.
Leave the bread in your freezer until you're ready to use it. Avoid exposing the bread to any significant temperature fluctuations.
Try to avoid bagging and freezing bread on humid days. Humidity can cause a loaf of bread to get soft or even damp.

, Whether you have not yet frozen a loaf of bread or have recently defrosted a loaf, it's important to store it correctly. Proper storage will help prolong the quality of the bread and ensure that it is still in good shape when you reach for it next.It's best not to store bread in the refrigerator. While the cool temperature can help prevent mold from growing, it can also dry out your bread prematurely.
Crusty breads and rolls keep best when stored in a paper bag and eaten within a day of baking. These breads may not survive the freezing process as well as a heartier loaf of bread.
Regular loaves should be kept at room temperature.
Keep regular loaves of bread in a bread bag, plastic bag, or bread box with adequate ventilation.

, Bread will stay relatively fresh in the freezer, but it will not stay good indefinitely. Even frozen bread has a finite shelf life, and should be eaten within a few weeks of freezing (if possible).Some bakers recommend using frozen bread within three months. Other bakers recommend using a frozen loaf of bread within one month.The biggest factors in determining whether your bread will keep in the freezer for a month or three months are the type of bread you've frozen, the conditions you stored it in prior to freezing, and whether the bread was kept at a stable temperature while frozen.
Leaving a loaf frozen in your freezer for too long, or subjecting the frozen loaf to drastic temperature fluctuations, can have a negative impact on the bread's quality.

Disinfect your counter top.,
Check the date.,
Use your bacon immediately after thawing it.",How to Freeze Bacon4," At the supermarket, be sure that your bacon is the very last item you select before checking out.If you pick up your bacon at the beginning of your supermarket trip, it’s potentially developing bacteria while you are checking the other items off your list.

, Do not use previously opened bacon that has already been stored in your fridge. Cured meats like bacon can spoil or develop bacteria at temperatures higher than 40 degrees Fahrenheit, so be sure to prepare your bacon for individual freezing immediately after purchasing it., While this step might seem obvious, it’s still important. Even beyond washing your hands before and after you prepare your bacon, you should also wash your hands at any point after touching the bacon and before touching any supplies.


For instance, if you need to grab some more wax paper or a freezer bag, don’t forget to wash your hands first. Otherwise, your roll of wax paper or box of storage bags will be contaminated.

, It’s important to disinfect both before and after you prepare your bacon for freezing. Any bacteria that is on your counter can be transferred to the wax paper and onto your bacon.

, Be sure to check the “use by” date and the number of days recommended for refrigeration, as well. While freezing keeps your bacon fresher longer, you should definitely freeze your bacon prior to the expiration date. Likewise, if you needed to store the bacon in your fridge before freezing it, be sure to freeze it before the end of the suggested refrigeration period,which is seven days.The longer bacon is stored, the less flavorful it will be. For best quality, store your bacon in the freezer for no more than one month.Three months is the recommended maximum storage time., Always thaw food in the refrigerator or in cold water. If using cold water, replace the water at 30 minute intervals. Do not thaw bacon at room temperature."

Trim the beans.,
Prepare the cookware.,
Blanch the beans in the boiling water for 3 minutes.,
Transfer the green beans to the cold water.,
Drain the beans.,
Pack the green beans.,
Freeze the green beans.",How to Freeze Green Beans1,"


Only use beans that are blemish free. Look for green beans that have no small beans inside them. While the small beans don't hurt the taste or quality of the beans, they signify that the green bean is past its prime.






Use the freshest beans possible. Freeze them the day you pick them from your garden or as soon as possible after you purchase them. If you must wait to freeze green beans, store them in the refrigerator in the meantime.





;
,,

Use a paring knife to snip the ends off the beans. If the green beans have any bug spots or bruises, you can cut them out with the paring knife.






Cut the beans to the length that you prefer. You can leave them whole, or you can cut the beans into pieces about one-inch long. A bean Frencher is a device that allows you to cut the beans into long, thin strips.







,

Put a large pot of water on to boil. Leave room in the pot for the beans. Covering the pot with a lid makes the water boil faster and conserves energy.






Fill a second large pan or bowl with ice cubes and water.







,


This process removes enzymes that break down the quality of the beans.






Be sure not to let the beans boil for too long, or they will overcook.







,

Use a slotted spoon to move the beans from one pot to the other.






Add more ice to the beans, if necessary.






Chill the beans at least three minutes.







,

It's important to get as much moisture as possible off the beans. Otherwise, they may have ice crystals form on them in the freezer, which can cause the flavor to deteriorate.






Use a paper or dish towel to remove extra moisture from the beans.







,

Use freezer bags that zip or bags that seal with a vacuum sealer.






Put enough beans in each bag to make a meal for your family. This way you'll be able to defrost exactly as many as you need instead of the entire batch of beans. A rough measurement is one handful of beans per serving.






Close the zippered bag almost all the way. Insert a straw into the opening. Draw out the remaining air through the straw. Withdraw the straw as you finish sealing the bag.






Label the bags with the date you froze them.







,


Rearrange the beans in the bags so the bags are lying as flat as possible. This allows the beans to freeze quickly and preserves the fresh taste.
Frozen beans will keep for nine months in a conventional freezer, and longer in a deep freeze appliance.

Plan ahead when making the soup.,
Fill a sink with ice, and add enough water to turn the ice into a slush.,
Pour the soup pot into new, metal container and place it into the ice bath right after you take it off the stove.Metal loses heat a lot quicker compared to other materials, such as glass or plastic.,

Check the temperature often.,
Choose a plastic, re-sealable, freezer-safe bag.,
Label the bag.,
Place the bag into a jar, and flip the top edges over the mouth of the jar.,
Fill the bag with the soup.,
Seal the bag.,
Place the soup into the freezer.",How to Freeze Soup," Not all items freeze well, so if you are making your soup with the intention of freezing it, you might want to exclude these items. You can add them in fresh when you are reheating the soup later.


Items that don't freeze well include: cream, eggs, fresh herbs, and pasta.Veggies freeze well, but you may want to slightly undercook them to better preserve texture.If you are freezing soup that already has these items in it, don't worry. There are a few things you can do to preserve their texture and flavor.;
, You will have to chill your soup first before you can place it into the freezer. If you put hot soup into the freezer, you will risk thawing the other items in there. The soup also won't freeze evenly, or fast enough to prevent bacterial growth.Plan ahead. The ice bath needs to be level with the soup, once you put the pot in.

, If you have a lot of soup, consider dividing it into smaller metal containers, and sticking all of them into the ice bath.


The ice bath must be level with the soup. If it is too deep, drain some water/ice. If it is too shallow, add some more water/ice.

, This will help distribute the cold throughout the soup. It will also help it cool more evenly. You can use an ordinary spoon, or for even faster results, a cooling paddle. Cooling paddles are plastic paddles that are filled with water and then frozen solid. Commercial kitchens use these to stir hot soups to make them chill faster.


Consider placing a fan next to the soup. This will help move warm air away from the soup., As the soup cools, the ice will begin to melt. When this happens, you will need to drain the excess water, and add even more ice. The ice bath should always be level with the soup. It should also always be filled with ice, and not just cold water.

, Use a clean, meat or cooking thermometer to gauge the temperature. Once the soup reaches 40°F (4°C), you place it into the freezer., These bags are usually thicker and more durable than your average sandwich bag. If you are freezing a lot of soup, consider using different sized bags for different portion sizes, such as gallons and quarts.


Plastic bags will save space in your freezer. If you are hesitant about using plastic bags and don't care about saving space, use a plastic box with a tight-fitting lid instead.

, Write the name of the soup and the date using a permanent marker. Frozen soup will not last forever, and needs to be used within a certain amount of time. Dairy-based soups will only last 2 months, while broth-based soups will last 3 months. Any longer, and the taste and texture will be compromised., This will hold the bag stable. Make sure that the jar is large enough to hold the bag.If you are using a plastic container, set the container down on a stable surface.

, Use a ladle to transfer the soup from the pot to the bag. If you are using a plastic container, leave ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) of space between the soup and the lid. This will allow for the soup to expand while freezing. It will also reduce the chances of freezer burn., Pull the bag out of the jar, and squeeze out as much air as you can. An easy way to do this is to close the bag most of the way, and then to press the air out. Seal the bag tightly. If you are using a plastic container, simply place the lid on tightly.

, Lay the bag(s) flat on the bottom of the freezer. When they freeze and become solid, you can stack them to save space.If you are using plastic containers, you don't have to wait for the soup to freeze. You can simply stack them from the start.


Soups that contain grains and starches, such as beans, pasta, or potatoes, can go mushy. To keep this from happening, place the soup towards the back of the freezer. The temperature is most consistent there."

If you're doing steaks (or similar cuts of meat), remember how many pieces are in each package. This'll come into play later on when you're labeling the package for freezing.

, The meat should lay perpendicular to the opposite corner of paper.

, This'll come in handy during the next step, so when you fold that same paper side over the meat, the corner will be nice and tight.

Try to keep the fold very tight against the side of the meat.







, Flip the meat towards the far end of the paper as you did the first time.

, Start by folding the edge of the paper a little over itself, then fold the entirety of that side of paper over the meat.


If the corner of the side of paper sticks out beyond the meat, you can either fold it back upon itself, or tuck the tail into the crease of the first side you folded over.

, Keep the meat inside the paper very tightly as you do this. It takes practice, but you'll improve with time.

, Usually two 2"" pieces of freezer tape will suffice.

, You'll want to include the type of meat (beef, chicken, etc.), the cut of meat, and the date. If you're doing steaks (or similar cuts of meat), include how many steaks are in each package.


If you're freezing meat of several animals (such as several deer, or several cows), you may want to label each package for each animal. This way, if you find later that one of the animals has really bad meat, you don't have to dispose of all the frozen meat. One way to label the meat for this would be to label it as 'Cow #1, Cow #2', etc.

While your baby may not eat this much in one sitting, the rest of the food can be refrigerated for later.However, most 1-year-olds can eat a jar each of fruits and vegetables in a day., Use hot, soapy water to clean the jars.Glass canning jars are boil-safe, so you can boil them in a large pot if you're really worried about removing bacteria.

,


Use a spoon or a zip-top bag with the corner snipped to fill the jars., Leave space at the top so the food has room to expand in the freezer., Remove any food that spilled over the side.

, You can use metal lids, but Ball also makes plastic storage caps that you can use in the freezer., Add the date and ingredients.


Baby food should only be kept in the freezer for 2 months., Leave the food in the freezer to solidify., Place the jar in the refrigerator overnight to thaw it. You can keep any leftovers in the refrigerator for a couple of days."

Also, peel the fruits and vegetables.Remove skin and fat from the meat., You can use any method you choose, such as steaming or baking, but try to avoid using extra fats. Boiling works best for grains. Some of the fruits won't need to be cooked, such as mangoes or pears, if they're soft enough.Reserve the cooking juices for later.

, It can be difficult to mash or purée hot foods.

, You can use a blender, a food processor, food grinder, a ricer, or even just a fork.If the mixture is too thick, add water, formula, or breast milk to loosen it up. You can also use the cooking water to thin it out.You'll especially need liquid if you're puréeing meat.Stick to one food per container at first to make sure your baby is not allergic to it. Once you've determined if your baby has allergies, don't be afraid to mix foods. For instance, you could try blueberries and sweet potatoes together or pears and peaches.
For toddlers, you can simply chop meat in small bites.
You can add a seasoning or two to each food, but stay away from anything spicy., For younger babies, make sure the food doesn't have any chunks in it."

Purchase frozen fish in a sealed container.,
Place it in the refrigerator overnight to thaw it gradually.,
Check the thawed fish to make sure it's good.,
Cook the fish according to your recipe.",How to Thaw Frozen Fish1," Make sure the fish you're thawing is in good condition before you thaw it and eat it. Frozen fish should be packaged in plastic that has not been torn or crushed. When you're buying frozen seafood, examine it closely to make sure it seems safe.Purchase seafood that is completely frozen, not partially thawed. It should be stored in the freezer case below the ""thaw line.""Don't buy fish that has ice crystals or frost inside covering the fish. That means it has been in storage for a very long time, and may no longer be good to eat.;
, The night before you know you want to make fish the next day, put it in the refrigerator so it will slowly defrost. This keeps the fish at a constantly cool temperature while also allowing it to thaw completely.


Thawing fish in the refrigerator is the best way to preserve its taste and texture.
Thawing fish in the refrigerator takes several hours. If you're out of time, try a different method. Don't be tempted to just place it on the counter to let it thaw; the outer portions of the fish could start to go bad before the inside is completely defrosted., Thawed fish should have the same texture and smell as fresh fish. While it might not have the same fresh, bright color, it shouldn't be mottled or discolored. Sniff the fish; if it smells too fishy or decayed, it's no longer usable. Thawed fish may have a slightly fishy smell, but it shouldn't be off-putting.

, Thawed fish can be used in place of fresh fish in any recipe. Cook the fish to the proper temperature. Fish is typically finished cooking when it's no longer translucent and the texture is flaky and firm.

Make sure your freezer is functioning properly.,
Check the seal on your freezer door.,
Set your freezer to the right temperature.",How to Prevent Freezer Crystals1," If you are noticing a lot of ice build up in your freezer, it may be a sign that something isn't functioning correctly. One potential problem is is blocked airflow. Freezers need to have proper airflow around the cooling coils and vents. If any of the freezer's vents or coils are dirty, blocked or clogged, this could cause an issue with ice build up.Condenser coils are usually located in the back of the freezer, towards the bottom of the refrigerator. You'll likely need to remove a panel to access them.
Some refrigerators will have condenser coils that run up and down the entire back of the fridge.
Use a soft brush to gently remove dust and dirt from the coils.
Check the vents inside the freezer itself. Make sure there is no ice or food items clogging them up.
Your freezer may be too close to a wall to allow for proper ventilation. Try moving your freezer away from any walls or tight spaces.;
, Your freezer door should create an airtight seal when it's closed. However, if the seal itself is old or warped, it may be allowing air to flow in and out of the freezer. Airflow will cause ice to build up rapidly in your freezer. Check your freezer door's seal to make sure there are no spaces where air is escaping.Make sure something in the freezer isn't holding the door open a bit.
There may be a tiny space where air is entering the freezer. Run your hand along the edge of the seal to feel for any loose or cold areas.
You may need to replace older magnetic seals if they are no longer functioning.
You can try wiping the seal down to remove any buildup that may be preventing an airtight lock.

, Setting your freezer's temperature either too high or too low can cause excess ice to build up. In order to prevent these freezer crystals from accumulating, it can be a good idea to take a look at your freezer's thermometer. Try to adjust the thermometer to an ideal temperature to reduce the amount of ice that is forming in your freezer.Your freezer should be set to 0°F or -18°C.
Make sure you don't change the temperature by opening the door too often or by not closing it all the way.

Cook some meat or tofu.,
Include some veggies.,
Add some beans.,
Steam some rice.",How to Prepare Homemade Freezer Burritos1," If you want a heartier meal, pick a protein to add to your burritos. You can go with things like ground turkey, beef, chicken, pork, or tofu.Simply season the protein of your choosing and then roast it in the oven, brown it on the stovetop, or cook it in a slow cooker.Seasoned ground beef is a quick and easy burrito filler.You can also cook a pork shoulder in your slow cooker for a flavorful carnitas.You can season the meat with ingredients like cumin, paprika, chili powder, cayenne pepper, garlic, and lime juice.;
, For some added flavor, you might want to add some vegetables to your burrito. To make a fajita burrito, you can stir-fry some peppers and onions. Although it is not technically a vegetable, you can also add some corn to the burrito for some extra filler.


If you want to spice up your corn, consider using a corn salsa in your burrito. However, make sure that it is not too runny.

, Another great source of protein that you can add to your burritos is beans. If you want a quick addition, you can add a spoonful of canned refried beans to your burritos. For a healthier option, you can cook whole beans and then add them to the burrito. If you want to go meatless, just add a couple of different types of beans, such as black or pinto beans.Instead of using canned beans, you can cook dried beans, which are less mushy and tend to have a fuller flavor. They also do not have the preservatives of canned beans.

, Adding some rice to your burritos adds a nice texture and flavor to your burrito that will help keep you full. Simply steam or boil the rice of your choosing until it is soft. You can add some plain white rice to the burrito or make Spanish rice for some extra flavor."

Cook the beans until they are golden brown and crispy.",How to Freeze Green Beans4," Take them out of the freezer bag and place them in a strainer over a bowl. Allow them to thaw completely.

, Excess moisture will cause the beans to come out soggy.

, Use a whisk to stir the mixture until it is smooth.

, Allow the oil to heat until it is ready to fry. Test whether it's ready by inserting the handle of a wooden spoon. When bubbles start to form around the spoon, the oil is ready.


Don't use olive oil to fry, since it breaks down when heated to high temperatures. Peanut oil, vegetable oil or canola oil is a better choice.

, Put the beans inside the bag. Close it and shake well.

, Continue transferring beans until you have an even layer of beans.


Don't overcrowd the skillet, or the beans will turn out soggy.






Avoid overlapping the beans.

Seal it in a plastic bag.,
Place the fish in a pot of cold water.,
Consider defrosting it in the microwave.",How to Thaw Frozen Fish2," Place the fish in a plastic bag and tie the bag in a knot to completely seal it. You don't want the water to actually touch the fish. The cool temperature of the water will be able to thaw the fish through the bag., If the fish floats, put a plate or another weight on top to keep it completely submerged. The fish will thaw quickly in the cold water. Let it sit for about an hour to make sure it thaws completely before using.As an alternative, you can run the fish under cold running water to thaw it out. The water doesn't have to run rapidly; a steady stream will do. This will defrost the fish more rapidly than placing it in a pot of cold water. However, use running water only for thinner fish filets, since you don't want to waste too much water by running it for half an hour or more.
Check the fish to see whether it has completely defrosted by pressing your finger against the flesh. If it still feels frozen in the middle, let it continue to thaw.
Don't thaw fish in hot water. This will thaw the fish unevenly and too quickly, changing its taste and texture. Thawing in hot water will also make the outer edges susceptible to getting contaminated with bacteria before the inside of the fish is finished thawing.

, Use the “defrost” setting in your microwave as an alternative to icy water. Place your fish in a microwave-safe container and defrost it for several minutes. Check on the fish often, and stop the defrost cycle while the fish is still icy but malleable.


Use this method only if you're planning to cook the fish immediately after thawing.
Be careful not to actually cook the fish in the microwave; take it out while it's still cold to make sure the texture and flavor don't start to deteriorate.

Rinse the fish when you remove it from the freezer.,
Cook the fish right away.,
Know which recipes require thawed fish.",How to Thaw Frozen Fish3," This will get rid of any ice crystals and other buildup it acquired while it was frozen. Give it a good rinse under cool running water. Dry it off with a paper towel before proceeding.

, If you don't have the time or inclination to defrost a piece of fish, you can skip the hassle and cook it frozen.Certain cooking methods allow you to turn a piece of frozen fish into a delicious dinner with no intermediary thawing step. Try these methods:



Steaming. Place the fish in an inch or two of broth and slowly steam it. It's healthy, delicious cooking method that results in silky fish, whether you start with fresh or raw fish.

Baking. Brush the fish with olive oil and place it in a roasting pan. Bake the fish until it's no longer opaque and easily flakes apart.
Use a foil packet on the grill. If you really want to grill the fish, brush it with oil and sprinkle it with seasonings, then wrap it up in a foil packet and crimp the edges. Place it on a hot grill. The fish will steam in the packet and taste delicious when it's finished.
Add it to soup or stew. If you have shrimp, mussels or clams that are frozen, you can simply add them to stew or soup that's simmering hot. The seafood will start cooking in the seasoned liquid and be ready to eat within a few minutes.

, Some recipes require that fish be thawed in order to achieve the right texture and cook evenly. For example, grilling frozen fish might cause you to end up with a piece of fish that's overcooked on the outside and cold on the inside. Frying frozen fish might also result in undercooked pieces. Check the recipe you're using and see if it specifies that you must use thawed fish for best results.If you're not sure whether you can cook the fish while it's frozen, it's probably better to defrost it first, just in case.
However, if a recipe specifies that the fish should be thawed, you can still take a risk and cook it frozen. Just add a few minutes to the specified cooking time, and make sure the fish is cooked through before you serve it.

Don't leave the door open for long.,
Take the air out of any bags.,
Keep your freezer full.,
Don't store food for too long.",How to Prevent Freezer Crystals2," Anytime you open the door on your freezer, warm air will come rushing in. When this warm, moist air enters the freezer it will immediately freeze onto any surface it touches. Always open and close your freezer door quickly to avoid any unnecessary ice build up in your freezer.Only open the door when you need to put something in or take something out.
Avoid looking too long for something in the freezer. Only open the door when you are ready to take it out.
Always make sure the door is fully and completely shut when you close it.

, Much of the ice that forms in a freezer comes from the moisture in the food. In order to help cut down on the amount of ice in your freezer, it can be helpful to take air out of any freezer storage bags. Removing the air will trap the moisture in the food, instead of allowing it to escape and turn into ice elsewhere in your freezer.Squeeze the air out of any plastic freezer bags that you store food in.
You can use a drinking straw to suck most of the air out of a bag, creating a near vacuum seal.
Any resealed bags should be closed tightly, leaving little room for air.
Solid containers should be full of food to avoid leaving much space for air.
Make sure any containers with lids are securely shut.
Try to use storage bags that are specifically designed for freezers.

, More air in your freezer will mean more ice build up. Freezers that are full of food will usually have slower rates of ice buildup than empty ones. Whenever possible, try to keep your freezer well stocked to cut down on the amount of empty space. Keeping your freezer full will help reduce the amount of freezer crystals you have to contend with., Storing food in your freezer can be a great way to keep perishable food items safe. However, storing food too long can cause it to lose its moisture, resulting in freezer burn. The lost moisture will accumulate inside your freezer and create more ice crystals. Try to remove food that has been stored for a long time to help prevent the buildup of freezer crystals.Write the date on something you are adding to your freezer. This will help you track how long it's been stored.
Freezer burn will take months to occur. Try to use or remove items that have been stored for more than a few months.

Learn if your freezer has an auto-defrost feature.,
Remove all the food from the freezer and unplug it.,
Get ready to deal with melt water.,
Hold the door open and allow ice to melt.,
Clean your freezer.,
Put the food back in and turn the freezer on again.",How to Prevent Freezer Crystals3," Most modern freezers will have an automatic defrosting function. This feature will automatically remove any freezer crystals that might have built up. However, older freezers will not have this feature and will require you to manually defrost it. Check with your freezer's instruction manual to learn more about its features.

, Before you defrost your freezer, you will need to remove all items from it. Place your frozen items in another freezer or cold place. This will give you room to work with and will prevent frozen items from defrosting. After everything is removed, including the shelves, you can unplug the freezer.You may need to use a friend or family member's freezer while you defrost.
You could also store your food in a cooler while your work to defrost your freezer.

, Once your food has been removed from your freezer, you'll be ready to defrost. However, it's a good idea to get ready for the melting ice. You'll want something to catch the water as it comes out of the freezer. Having a good way to catch the melt water can help prevent a big mess.Get some old rags ready to lay along the front of the freezer. These will help soak up ice water as it melts.
Having a bucket handy can help you store the melt water before dumping it.
Keep a mop ready for any water that spills onto the floor.

, Once everything is removed from the freezer and it has been unplugged, you can begin defrosting. Find something to hold the door open with, allowing warm air into the freezer to melt the ice. The goal is to wait for all of the ice to melt or get to a point where it can be removed by gently scraping it away with a spatula.You can add a pot of hot water to the freezer to help speed up the defrosting process.
You might try using a fan to move air in and out of the freezer.
Avoid using a hairdryer as this can be a safety hazard as the ice melts.
Never use anything sharp to break up ice.

, Now that the ice has been removed from your freezer and it is completely empty, you can give it a good cleaning. Take a cloth and some gentle cleaning solution and wipe down the inside of the freezer. Take your time and make your freezer as clean as you can before adding your food back in.Any mild detergent will work fine for cleaning your freezer.
You can make a simple cleaner by mixing 3 tablespoons of baking soda into 1 quart of water.

, Now that your freezer has been defrosted, cleaned and dried, you can put your food back in and turn it on again. Your freezer should run much more efficiently and all of the ice crystals will be gone for a while. Keep an eye on the build up of ice and defrost again whenever necessary.The more you let ice build up in your freezer, the longer the defrosting process will take.
Make sure your freezer is totally dry before putting food back in. Any moisture will refreeze and cause ice to quickly build up again.

Make scrambled eggs.,
Cook the meat.,
Prepare some potatoes.",How to Prepare Homemade Freezer Burritos2," Eggs are a healthy breakfast staple. They provide you with some much needed protein and are a great source of healthy nutrients. For your burritos, you will want to scramble your eggs, which will prevent any foodborne illness and make them easier to ladle into a burrito.You can scramble your eggs plain or add salt and pepper for some extra flavor. In addition, you can whip in some milk or cream to make them extra fluffy.

, Breakfast meats are one of life’s purest pleasures. For some added deliciousness, consider cooking bacon, sausage, or ham for your burrito. For a healthier option, consider turkey, chicken, or tofu-based breakfast meat products instead of pork., Potatoes add some consistency to your breakfast burrito that will help keep you full. You can fry them on the stovetop or roast them in the oven. You can also add pre-made frozen potatoes to you burritos or you can make your own hash browns. If you are frying or roasting the potatoes yourself, consider adding onions and green peppers for a classic potatoes O’Brien.You can also substitute sweet potatoes for a more flavorful and healthy morning meal. Consider using white-skinned sweet potatoes, which will get less mushy when cooked."

Get some tortillas.,
Let everything cool to room temperature.,
Sprinkle on extras.,
Roll the burritos.,
Freeze the burritos.",How to Prepare Homemade Freezer Burritos3," The key to a great frozen burrito is the right tortilla. You will want to get a large tortilla that is capable of holding the ingredients that you will be adding. If you buy them at the grocery store or make them yourself, you will want a flour tortilla that is at least 8 inches (20.32 cm) in diameter. Look for flour tortillas, which are flexible enough to hold a lot of ingredients. Plus, they freeze and reheat well.When you are at the store, look for tortillas that have “burrito-sized” on the packaging.
For a healthier option, you might consider whole wheat or spinach tortillas.

, In order to avoid getting a soggy burrito, you should let all of the ingredients, including the tortillas, cool down to room temperature. This will ensure that the moisture from the hot ingredients does not condense inside of the burrito, making it soggy and gross when you reheat it. Once you finish cooking everything, let the fillings cool on your counter for about 30 minutes.If you keep your tortillas in the refrigerator, be sure to take them out and allow them to thaw before you wrap the burritos. If they are cold, your tortillas will likely crack when you go to wrap them.

, Once everything has cooled, you can sprinkle some shredded cheddar cheese, add some diced roasted chilies, or squirt on a little hot sauce. As long as it will freeze and reheat well, you can add whatever you would like. However, you should avoid adding anything that is too watery, so consider adding chunky salsas that are not very runny.Avoid things that will not freeze or reheat will, like sour cream, avocados, or lettuce.

, In order to fill the burrito properly, add about one spoonful of each ingredient to the center of the tortilla and then sprinkle on your toppings. This will ensure that you are able to roll the burrito closed tightly without spilling any of its contents. To roll a burrito, pinch in the sides of the tortilla, fold in one end, and roll it closed. If you are unable to close the burrito, consider spooning out some of the ingredients., Wrap each burrito in tin foil, plastic wrap, or wax paper. After you wrap them, place the burritos in freezer bags. You want to try to get the burrito as airtight as you can to prevent freezer burn and help it last longer..Once they are frozen, your burritos will be good for up to 3 months.

Prepare the watermelon.,
Rinse the fruit under running water.,
Spread the watermelon pieces out on a baking sheet.,
Freeze until firm.,
Transfer the pieces to freezer-safe containers.,
Freeze until ready to use.",How to Freeze Watermelon1," Wash and dry the watermelon before cutting it. After cutting it into pieces that can be stored more readily, cut away the rind and remove any seeds you see.


Wash your hands with hot soap and water first to prevent any bacteria on your hands from contaminating the fruit.;
, If necessary, use a clean vegetable brush to scrub away any dirt.


Pat dry with clean paper towels.
Cut the watermelon in lengthwise halves, then into quarters. From there, you can choose to cut the fruit into wedges, slices, cubes, or balls. Cubes and balls are the easiest to freeze.
If you did not do so as you were cutting the watermelon into pieces, cut off the rind and fish out any seeds with your fingers.

, Keep the pieces in a single, even layer and make sure that none of them are touching.To reduce the amount of cleaning up you might need to do, you could consider lining the baking sheet with parchment paper before placing the watermelon on it.
It is important that you do not allow the pieces to touch. If the pieces do touch during this initial freezing process, they might freeze together, making it harder to pack them now and to defrost them later.

, Place the baking sheet in the freezer for a few hours. When ready, the watermelon pieces should be frozen solid and no longer soft enough to press into with your fingers.


If you have difficulty removing the frozen watermelon from the baking sheet, you might need to use a sturdy spatula to help you. Usually, however, the heat from your hands will be enough to help free the pieces from the tray.

, Place the frozen watermelon into a large freezer-safe plastic bag or resealable plastic container. Leave at least 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace and label the container with the current date.


The headspace is vital because it provides the watermelon with ample room to expand as it freezes. Without the headspace, the container may break or open.
The container you use must be resistant to both moisture and vapor, and the material must be thick enough to protect the watermelon against other odors or flavors. Glass is not recommended since it is prone to breaking in extreme cold.

, Watermelon can usually be kept frozen for 8 to 12 months as long as the temperature remains at 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius).


When you are ready to use the watermelon, let it thaw in the refrigerator before adding to dishes or otherwise consuming it. Thawed watermelon should be used within four days.

Pick your participants.,
Choose your group type.,
List allergies and ""won't eats"".,
Set some ground rules.,
Eat!",How to Start or Create a Freezer Group," Start asking around. E-mail your friends. Get them to email their friends. Ask the members of your book club or community group. Choose two or three. Ideally choose people who have the same types of food preferences and close to the same number of eaters. (For example, it's unwise to pair yourself up with, say, a child-free vegetarian couple and a meat-eating family of 9. No matter what is made/shared, someone will be disappointed.) Also, it's a good idea to choose people who live within reasonable driving/walking distance of each other, as you will have to transport some good eating!;
, Generally speaking, there are two types of Freezer Groups.


""Make, Freeze and Bring"" - In these groups, everyone makes many portions of a single dish at home. Then, he/she separates it by family/recipient and freezes the portions individually. (For example, you might make 16 servings of meatballs, then divide it up into 4 Tupperware containers, each being one dinner for a family of four) Then, the group meets at regular intervals -- weekly, bi-weekly, monthly -- at a designated person's house to exchange food.
""Make Together and Freeze"" - In these type of groups, the participants will meet at a member's house and cook meals together. At the end of the day, they box up the foods in containers they brought with them and freeze when they get home. Either the members bring their own ingredients or the host provides them and everyone chips in to pay for them.
The first option is great for experienced cooks who just want to make and swap. It’s high on convenience and low on social contact. However, if you're one who has food allergies or is particular about preparation, this may not be your best choice, as you have no control of what you receive. The second option is a good option for social butterflies and/or people who want to improve their cooking skills. Since you'll all be cooking together, experienced cooks might want to do the more difficult stuff while novice cooks handle the prep work (e.g. chopping, stirring). Obviously, this sort of arrangement requires that at least one person in the group has a large kitchen.

, Before things kick off, poll the group on food allergies and “won't eats.” A “won’t eat” is essentially a food you (or another eater) finds so disgusting, you would sooner eat your own sneaker. Incorporate these preferences into your meal making.

, Instituting some basic ground rules helps set expectations and makes sure everyone gets the most out of the experience. Here are a few items you may want to focus on:


Cost - Figure out a target budget. If you’re cooking together, you may wish to take the grocery bill and divide it by the number of Freezer Group members or eaters. If you're cooking separately, you may wish to set a target amount per meal or per eater.
Containers - Decide whether to use your own containers (and swap them) or invest in containers for the entire group.
Clean Up - If you're cooking together, make it clear that everyone in the group is part of the cleanup process and leaves the host/hostess with a clean house. The purpose of this group is convenience. As such, it’s bad manners to leave a host/hostess with a kitchen he/she has to spend hours cleaning.
Meeting Location/Schedule - Set up a schedule (for swapping and/or cooking) ahead of time. Presumably you want to do this because you're busy. As such, advance notice lets you plan (and cook) accordingly.
Portions and Meal Components - Outline the number of portions everyone is responsible for making. Also, decide what a “meal"" means. For example, some groups make and freeze complete dinners (e.g. main dish and side dishes), while others just focus on a main dish.

, You've cooked. You've swapped. You've frozen. Now, get ready to enjoy a delicious home cooked meal (without the hassle).

Select your tomatoes.,
Wash the tomatoes to remove dirt from the garden.,
Remove the stem from the tomatoes.",How to Freeze Tomatoes1," Pick tomatoes that are firm, yet not hard. Avoid tomatoes with bug spots, bruises and other damage. You can use them, but you're going to have to do a lot more trimming.While you can use any breed of tomatoes, Roma tomatoes are the best for freezing purposes. They are meatier and contain less water. That means you get more thicker tomato sauce from them with less cooking time.;
, Be sure to rub the tomatoes to remove any excess dirt. Pat the tomatoes dry with a clean cloth or paper towel.

, The area around the stem is usually tough, so remove it too. Cut off any damaged portion of the tomatoes."

Prepare the watermelon.,
Rinse the fruit under running water.,
Add sugar to the fruit.,
Pack in freezer-safe containers.,
Freeze until ready to use.",How to Freeze Watermelon2," Wash and dry the watermelon before cutting it. After cutting it into pieces that can be stored more readily, cut away the rind and remove any seeds you see.


Wash your hands with hot soap and water first to prevent any bacteria on your hands from contaminating the fruit.

, If necessary, use a clean vegetable brush to scrub away any dirt.


Pat dry with clean paper towels.
Cut the watermelon in lengthwise halves, then into quarters. From there, you can choose to cut the fruit into wedges, slices, cubes, or balls. Cubes and balls are the easiest to freeze.
If you did not do so as you were cutting the watermelon into pieces, cut off the rind and fish out any seeds with your fingers.

, Transfer the watermelon to a bowl and sprinkle it with 1 lb (450 g) of white granulated sugar per 5 lbs (2250 g) of watermelon. Mix well with your hands or a mixing spoon to coat thoroughly., Transfer the coated watermelon into a freezer-safe plastic bag or plastic container, leaving 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace at the top of the container. Label the container with the current date.


The headspace is vital because it provides the watermelon with ample room to expand as it freezes. Without the headspace, the container may break or open.
The container you use must be resistant to both moisture and vapor, and the material must be thick enough to protect the watermelon against other odors or flavors. Glass is not recommended since it is prone to breaking in extreme cold.

, Place the watermelon in a freezer with the temperature kept at 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius). When stored in these conditions, watermelon should be good for 8 to 12 months.


When you are ready to use the watermelon, let it thaw in the refrigerator before adding to dishes or otherwise consuming it. Thawed watermelon should be used within four days.

Boil sugar and water in a small saucepan.,
Let the syrup chill.,
Prepare the watermelon.,
Rinse the fruit under running water.,
Combine a little syrup and the watermelon.,
Keep the watermelon submerged.,
Freeze until ready to use.",How to Freeze Watermelon3," Combine 4 cups (1 L) of water with 1 3/4 cup (440 ml) of white sugar in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is fully dissolved.Alternatively, you could replace up to 2/5 cup (100 ml) of the sugar with equal parts corn syrup or mild honey.
Note that this is the best method to use if you want to preserve more of the natural texture of the watermelon.

, Transfer the syrup into a refrigerator for 30 to 60 minutes, or until it becomes cool to the touch.


Hot syrup can actually cook the fruit, so at the very least, the syrup should already be at room temperature if not cooler before you add it to the watermelon.

, While the syrup chills, wash and dry the watermelon. Cut the melon into pieces that can be stored more readily, then cut away the rind and remove any seeds you see.


Wash your hands with hot soap and water first to prevent any bacteria on your hands from contaminating the fruit.

If you did not do so as you were cutting the watermelon into pieces, cut off the rind and fish out any seeds with your fingers.

, Pour 1/2 cup (125 ml) syrup into a freezer-safe plastic container. Add the watermelon pieces, then add as much syrup as needed to keep the watermelon completely covered.


The container you use must be resistant to both moisture and vapor, and the material must be thick enough to protect the watermelon against other odors or flavors. Glass is not recommended since it is prone to breaking in extreme cold.

, Place a small piece of wax paper on top of the watermelon to help keep the pieces secure underneath the surface of the syrup.


Make sure that there is at least 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace at the top of the container when all is said and done. This headspace gives the contents of the container room to expand as they freeze, thereby preventing the container from cracking or opening under pressure.
Label the container with the current date before freezing it.

, Keep the watermelon stored in a freezer at 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) for up to 8 to 12 months.


When you are ready to use the watermelon, let it thaw in the refrigerator before adding to dishes or otherwise consuming it. Thawed watermelon should be used within four days.

Squeeze as much moisture as you can from the seeds in the colander.,
Cut the remaining tomato pieces into the desired size chunks.,
Fill zippered plastic freezer bags with the tomato pieces.,
Flatten the bags as much as possible to maximize storage space.",How to Freeze Tomatoes2," Put the tomatoes into the boiling water for one minute. The boiling water will loosen the tomatoes skins, thus making them easier to peel.

, Use the tip of a paring knife or tomato knife to pierce the skin on each tomato. Once there's a hole in the skin, it should slide right off. Discard the skin., Hold the tomatoes over the colander as you remove the seeds. It's not necessary to remove all of the seeds, but your tomato sauces are going to be more appealing without them. Squeeze the tomatoes slightly to remove the juice. Set the meaty portion of the tomatoes aside for now.

, Put the juice in a container. You can drink it, or you can use it for cooking. You may also freeze it.

, Smaller pieces thaw quickly and cook into sauce in less time.

, Remove as much air as possible by sucking air out with a straw as you close the zipper.


If you prefer, you may seal the tomatoes with a vacuum sealer. These can be purchased at kitchen supply stores.

Keep the filling separate from the crust.,
Place the filling in a freezer bag.,
Roll the pastry out into a pie tin.,
Freeze until ready to use.,
Thaw the filling and crust when ready to use.,
Assemble and bake as directed.",How to Freeze Quiche1," You can freeze unbaked quiche filling separately from the crust or you can freeze the entire unbaked quiche together, but if you want to maintain a crisper, flakier crust, it is strongly recommended that you freeze the filling separately.


You may also want to consider making the filling before the crust if you intend to keep it for long-term storage. The filling can last for several months in the freezer, but the quality of the crust will deteriorate after a few days.;
, Prepare the quiche filling as directed in the recipe's instructions. Pour the filling into a large plastic freezer bag and seal the bag, getting out as much excess air as possible beforehand.


Only use a freezer-safe bag or container. Do not use a glass container, and do not use a thin plastic bag that is too flimsy to hold up in the freezer.
Label the bag or container with the current date and the contents of the bag. This will make it easier to remember how long the filling has been in the freezer.

, As a general rule, it is better to prepare the crust shortly before baking it rather than making it ahead of time and trying to freeze it, but if you do decide to make the crust ahead of time, you should roll it out into its intended pie dish and place both the dish and crust into a large plastic freezer bag.


Label the bag with the current date. Doing so will make it easier to keep track of how long the crust has been in the freezer.

, Place both the crust and the filling in the freezer, keeping them at a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) until you intend to assemble and bake the dish.


An unbaked quiche filling can be frozen for up to one to three months, but the unbaked crust should not be frozen for much longer than 24 or 48 hours.

, Place the bag of filling and the crust in the refrigerator. Let them thaw in there slowly, until the filling warms up enough to turn back into a liquid.


The filling will need to thaw for a longer period of time than the pie crust. The crust only needs to be thawed for about 15 minutes. The filling will need to defrost in the refrigerator for one or two hours. Plan ahead of time, and make sure that the filling has ample time to thaw back into a liquid state before you need to bake it.

, Pour the filling into the crust and bake the quiche as directed in the recipe's instructions. Since both parts should be thawed by this point, the cooking time should not be affected.


Note, however, that if the quiche filling still contains ice crystals, you may need to bake it for an additional five minutes or so since the filling will need to warm up in addition to baking.

Drain the tofu.,
Place the block of tofu onto an absorbent surface.,
Press the tofu.,
Apply pressure for at least an hour.",How to Freeze Tofu1," If the tofu is in a package, open it up and drain off all of the water. Don't spend too much time on the draining process. If you aren't incredibly worried about texture and you just want to keep the food fresh, then feel free to skip the pressing steps and freeze the tofu directly after you drain it., Use a clean dish towel or a layer of 3-4 paper towels. This material should absorb the moisture.


If you are using paper towels, then you will need to switch them out every half-hour or so.

, Place a flat, heavy object on top. Over the course of an hour or so, the pressure from the weight of the object should gradually push the excess water out of the tofu hunk.Try using a cutting board and/or a skillet. The object should be heavy enough to apply enough pressure, but not so heavy that it crushes the tofu.
Make sure that the heavy object is clean! You are going to eat this tofu. Make sure that the object is not something that will be damaged by moisture – e.g. a book.

, The act of pressing should squeeze out most of the water. You'll know that the tofu is ready when it feels dry and firm."

Avoid freezer burn.,
Place the vegetables in the freezer.,
Learn how to defrost vegetables here.
",How to Freeze Vegetables," Rinse the vegetables in cold water, making sure to scrub off any lingering dirt. Washing the vegetables also ensures that you won’t eat the bacteria and pesticides on the surface of the vegetables. Pat the vegetables dry with paper towels., Using a cutting board and a sharp knife, cut your vegetables up so they are the size you would like them to be when you use them in a recipe. You can also freeze whole vegetables if you are not sure what you recipe you are going to be using them for.

, Many cooks recommend blanching your vegetables before freezing them. Blanching is when vegetables are briefly cooked in boiling water so they still retain their crispiness but are cooked through. Bring a pot of water to a boil. When the water is boiling, put the vegetables in, and cook for several minutes., Take the vegetables out of the boiling water and place them in the ice water. This process is called shocking the vegetables. Drain the vegetables.

, Make sure the vegetables are in a single layer and the pieces are not overlapping. If they overlap, they could freeze together. If this will not be a problem when using the vegetables in a recipe, you do not need to make sure they are not overlapping.You can also freeze a medley of vegetables together. Dice the vegetables you would like to freeze and place them in ice cube trays. Fill the trays with water. This will cause the vegetables to freeze into cubes.







, Freezer burn is when food is exposed to the frigid air of the freezer, causing the food to taste strange or develop brown blotches.


Wrap your vegetables in wax paper, aluminum foil, or plastic wrap after they have frozen completely on the baking sheet., Once you have wrapped your vegetables in your wrapping of choice, you can transfer them to a freezer container to be stored until you need them.Another good option for storage is to place the vegetables in resealable bags.
If you have a vacuum sealer, you can also use it to store your vegetables. Vacuum sealers are handy because they remove all air from the bag. When frozen vegetables are exposed to the air, their flavor can become slightly ‘off.’

Place the assembled quiche on a baking sheet.,
Freeze until firm.,
Cover the quiche with plastic wrap.,
Wrap a layer of aluminum foil over the dish.,
Consider placing the quiche into a large plastic freezer bag.,
Freeze until ready to use.,
Bake from frozen when ready.",How to Freeze Quiche2," If you decide to freeze an unbaked quiche after pouring the filling into the crust, do so by tray freezing it. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set the quiche on top.


The parchment paper is not strictly necessary, but lining the baking sheet with parchment paper first can make it easier to clean things up in case any of the filling spills out and onto the tray as you transfer it into the freezer.

, Transfer the quiche and the baking sheet into the freezer, letting it rest in as flat a position as possible. Freeze the quiche for several hours, or until the filling becomes solid.


The quiche should be as solid as possible. If the surface is soft, sticky, or tacky, it might stick to the plastic wrap or become indented after you place it in the freezer for storage.

, Get a large piece of plastic wrap and wrap it around the entire quiche, pressing the edges of the wrap together to create an airtight seal.


It is important that you place the plastic wrap over the quiche before you place the aluminum foil over it. The plastic wrap will prevent the foil from sticking to the quiche after it freezes., Cover the plastic wrap covered quiche with a layer of aluminum foil. Once again, you should seal the edges firmly to minimize the amount of air getting inside.


It is important that you do not let air come into contact with the quiche as it freezes. If the quiche gets exposed to air, ice crystals could form on the surface. These ice crystals could cause the crust to become soggy once they melt.

, If you do not have plastic wrap and/or aluminum foil, or if you are not confident that you created tight seals with either, place the quiche into a large plastic freezer bag and seal, squeezing out the excess air before zipping it closed.


Whether you do this step or not, you should label the outer layer of wrapping with the current date and the contents of the dish. Doing so will make it easier for you to keep track of how long the quiche has been in the freezer.

, Transfer the wrapped quiche to the freezer and let it remain there at a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) until you are ready to use it.


Unbaked quiche can be frozen for about one month without the quality being reduced.

, Do not thaw the quiche prior to baking it. Unwrap it and bake as directed according to the recipe's instructions, allowing 10 to 20 minutes of extra baking time.Baking the quiche from frozen is recommended since thawing it out first can increase the likelihood of the crust becoming soggy.

"

Bake from frozen until heated through.",How to Freeze Quiche3," Bake the quiche as directed, but place it on a baking sheet before doing so. When you finish baking it, transfer the tray to the freezer, and let the quiche freeze until the soft center is frozen as hard as ice.


Even though the quiche is technically solid after it bakes, the filling is still quite soft. Letting it tray freeze before going into long-term freezer storage can prevent the soft filling from getting damaged in the freezer.

, Use a layer of plastic wrap and a layer of aluminum foil to wrap up the pre-frozen quiche, making sure that all the edges are thoroughly sealed to prevent excess exposure to the air.


If necessary, you can also place the quiche in a large plastic freezer bag for an even more airtight seal.
Label the quiche with the current date and the contents of the dish. This will allow you to keep track of how long the quiche has been in the freezer.

, Keep the quiche in its pie dish and place it in the freezer, keeping it at a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) until you are ready to serve it.


Baked quiche can be frozen for two to three months, if necessary, without the quality being negatively affected., Do not thaw the quiche before you warm it up. Pull it out of the freezer and transfer it to an oven preheated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius). Let it bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until it has completely warmed through.It is recommended that you do not thaw the quiche before warming it. Thawing it first can make the crust get moist and soggy.

Microwave tofu.",How to Freeze Tofu3," Take the frozen tofu from the freezer several hours before you plan to cook it. Leave it out on the counter in the airtight container, and allow it to return to room temperature. If you properly pressed your tofu, then it should be much firmer and chewier once it has thawed., If you are in a hurry, then you can quickly thaw tofu by zapping it in the microwave for 30 seconds to one minute. The tofu will turn a bright yellow color; almost like amber. This is completely normal.

, Scrub off the dirt and debris with a stiff-bristled brush.

, Use a peeler to remove the potato skin, or if you're working with new potatoes, scrape it off. Rinse the potatoes to prepare them for blanching.


If the potatoes are large, chop them in half before blanching.






Don't cut the potatoes into small pieces; it's better to store them whole if possible.







, In the meantime, prepare a large bowl with ice water and set it aside.

, Allow them to blanch for 3 to 5 minutes. This process cleanses the potatoes of organisms and preserves their flavor and color.

First, cut off the tops and bottoms with a sharp knife, and then shave off the skins and cut out the core. You can dice the pineapple, cut it into large circles, or cut it into smaller squares. You can even use a handy-dandy pineapple corer if you want to get fancy., Either one will do. Make sure the sheet is large enough to hold all of the pineapple chunks -- if not, then you may have to use two sheets., Make sure they don't touch or else they will freeze together.

, You can do this for less time if the pieces of pineapple become completely frozen earlier.

, You can use a zip-seal bag, Tupperware, or any other storage container that has a seal. Make sure you get all of the air out of the bag first so that the pineapple chunks don't suffer from freezer burn. You should label the bag with the date so you know when it is still safe to eat it -- frozen pineapple can last in your fridge for up to six months., Just place the frozen pineapple in the blender, follow the recipe for the drink or smoothie, and enjoy. Remember to use a bit less ice, since the frozen pineapple will add some extra icy flavor to the beverage., Just take it out of the freezer and take a bite into the tasty, frozen fruit. Frozen fruit is delicious, and you can try the same trick with blueberries, raspberries, or any other fruit. It'll have an extra icy flavor that will make it taste even more delicious -- a little bit like ice cream.

, If you want to eat the pineapple raw but don't want it to be frozen, just place it in the refrigerator and thaw it overnight. Then take it out of the refrigerator and enjoy it on its own or drizzle it with a bit of lemon juice first. You can also add it to any fruit salad of your choice.

Select the pea pods.,
Shell the peas.,
Rinse the peas.,
Blanch the peas.,
Remove the peas.,
Let the peas drain either in the colander or cloth bag.,
Work quickly on this part.,
Place the bags or containers in the freezer.

",How to Freeze Peas1," Choose fresh, ripe pods with an even green color. They should be free of blemishes. Discard any which have black spots or mold.;
, As with the pod, discard any individual peas with spots, mold or other blemishes.


Get some helpers if you have a lot of peas to shell. This is a time consuming job but it's more fun if you can chat with others around the table while shelling. However, work quickly to transfer the peas to blanching, as peas start losing their freshness once exposed to air and the pea skins toughen.If you don't have helpers, shell only a few at a time, blanch, then shell some more, blanch those ones, etc.

, Tip the peas into a colander. Wash under running water, picking out any debris that you notice as you're cleaning them.


Tip into another colander and rinse out the first colander to clear away the dirt that washes off.
Rinse again. Then tip back and rinse another time.

, The peas need to be blanched to stay fresh-looking and green. Without blanching, they are likely to go brown and taste bad. To blanch:


Bring a large pot of water to the boil. Fill a large bowl with ice cold water and toss in a few ice cubes. Set to one side for dunking the peas into once blanched.
Add the peas in batches. If you are doing a lot of peas, you'll need to blanch them in batches. The peas should be kept inside a colander with handles that overlap the pan or in a muslin/other cloth bag and lowered into the boiling water. Otherwise, you'll find it really hard to retrieve them all fast enough when the blanching time is up.
Blanch for 3 minutes. Keep an eye on the pot in case it tries to boil over.

, Plunge them straight into the bowl of ice water to stop cooking instantly.

, Gently press down to remove excess water.

, The faster the peas get to the freezer, the greater the chance of them staying fresh and whole. If they stand too long at room temperature, they risk turning mushy. Place the blanched peas into resealable bags or suitable freezer containers. Pack them in as tightly as you can, to eliminate the air space. Leave about 1/2 inch/1.5cm at the top to allow for expansion during freezing.


Gently press down to remove excess air from the packages. Pouring ice cold water over the outside of the package can help eliminate more air.

Bake your pies according to the recipe directions.,
Allow the baked pies to cool completely.,
Cover each pie with an airtight material.,
Find a place in your freezer where the pies will be secure.,
Set the pies in the freezer carefully.,
Check your frozen pies occasionally to be sure the containers remain airtight.,
Remove the frozen pies from the freezer several hours before you plan to serve them.",How to Freeze Pies1," Although it is possible—and sometimes preferable—to freeze unbaked pies, pies are typically frozen after they have already been baked. This simplifies the thawing and reheating process.


Pies whose fillings is made of fruits or nuts—pecan, walnut, peach, cherry, apple, etc.—are relatively easy to bake, freeze, and reheat, because the firm texture of the fillings stays firm while frozen.It is unnecessary to change the recipe just because you are going to freeze the pies instead of eating them immediately after baking.;
, This can take up to several hours—but it is an important step. The pie should be cool when you can rest your hand on the bottom of the pie pan and do not feel any heat. If you freeze your baked pie without first letting it cool completely, the quality will diminish; the pie may become soggy or lose its flavor.You may simply set the pies on the counter to cool, or let them cool in the refrigerator.

, Start by putting several layers of cling wrap around the pies. The cling wrap will keep your pies from picking up bad tastes or smells from the freezer.


For extra protection, place each wrapped pie in an airtight storage container. You can wrap your pies in large zipping freezer bags or airtight plastic storage containers.
If you don’t have ziplock bags or large Tupperware, you can wrap the pies well with aluminum foil.

, You do not want the pies to be unsteady and fall. This will break the crust and make the pies much harder to bake and serve.


You’ll also want to avoid placing the pies in a position where they’ll have more items stacked on top of them. Although the frozen pies will be relatively stable, the crust can still be crushed or damaged if you place heavy objects on the pies.

, Do not place the pies on top of each other; each pie should have nothing placed on top of it for the duration of its time in the freezer.


If you do not have room in your freezer to distribute each pie individually, try to find a way to stack pies without damaging the filling or crust. First, freeze each pie individually, and then try stacking them inside of empty, clean pizza boxes.

, If the containers come open, the pies may receive freezer burn or may pick up a bad taste or smell from the freezer.


Fruit or nut pies can stay frozen for a relatively long time. They will keep in your freezer for up to 4 months.If you have a deep freeze, it will keep your pies safely frozen for a longer period of time., Allow the frozen pies to thaw completely before serving. If you would like to serve your pies hot, pre-heat your oven to 350°—then place the pies in the oven for about 6 minutes.


If you have enough time before you need to serve the pies, you may choose to let the pies thaw slowly in the refrigerator. You should give the pies at least 24 hours to thaw, if you choose this method.
If you prefer to serve the pie warm (apple or pecan pie, etc.), let the pie stand at room temperature for about 30 minutes, then place it in the oven at 350°, for about 30 minutes.

Pack the rhubarb pieces into freezer-safe containers.,
Pour fruit juice over the pieces.,
Freeze until ready to use.",How to Freeze Rhubarb," The best rhubarb stalks to eat are also the best stalks to freeze. Look for stalks that are firm, tender, and well-colored.

The color of ripe rhubarb will vary depending on the variety. Most are red with hints of green, but some are mostly green while others should be all red.
You should look for rhubarb with as few fibers as possible, but stalks with only a few fibers are usually fine.
The stalks should be about as thick as your thumb.;
, Rinse the rhubarb under cool, running water and scrub the dirt off gently using your fingers.

Pat dry with clean paper towels.

, If the rhubarb you chose has tough, fibrous skin on the outside, use your fingers to peel this layer off.

Only peel off the outer skin if it seems to peel off easily with your fingernails. If you cannot separate a skin from the stalk, you likely have a variety that does not have this tough outer layer. You should still remove any stringy fibers, though.
You should also remove all the leaves from the outside of the stalk.

, Use a serrated kitchen knife to cut the stalks into bite-size pieces.

The pieces can be anywhere from 1/2 inch to 2 inches (1.25 cm to 5 cm). No matter what size you choose, though, try to keep the pieces even. Evenly sized pieces will freeze and defrost better, making them easier to use.

, For any method, you can freeze rhubarb raw or blanched (pre-cooked). Blanching the rhubarb beforehand helps preserve the color and texture of the vegetable, though, so many people find the extra step worth the effort.

Boil water in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Rest a wire mesh colander inside the pot.
Transfer the rhubarb to the colander. Let it boil for 1 minute.
Remove the colander and the rhubarb from the boiling water. Immediately dunk the rhubarb into ice water and keep it there for another 1 minute. Doing so will stop the cooking process.
Spread the rhubarb out on clean paper towels and let air dry.

, Leave at least 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace at the top, and label the bag or container with the amount and the current date.

If using plastic bags instead of stiff containers, make sure that all excess air is squeezed out of the bag as possible before sealing it.
You can also sweeten the rhubarb before dry packing it. Combine 4 cups (1 L) of chopped rhubarb with 1 cup (250 ml) of granulated sugar until well coated. This is only optional, though, and should only be done if you plan to use the rhubarb for a sweetened recipe like jam or preserves.

, Place the rhubarb in the coldest part of the freezer. You can store it there, at 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) up to 10 or 12 months.When you are ready to thaw the rhubarb, defrost it in the refrigerator or in the microwave.

, Make sure that none of the pieces overlap or touch each other.

You can also line the baking sheet with parchment paper before adding the rhubarb so that the pieces will be easier to remove after freezing.If the pieces touch or overlap, they will end up freezing together, and it will be more difficult to pack them later on. The advantage of individual dry packing is that the pieces can be thawed in partial quantities rather than needing to be thawed all at once.

, Transfer the tray to the freezer, positioning it so that it is perfectly flat and not tilted. Let the rhubarb stay in the freezer for two hours, or until it becomes too solid to pierce with your thumbnail., Place the pieces into freezer-safe plastic bags or containers with a minimum headspace of 1/2 inch (1.25 cm). Label the container with the amount of rhubarb inside and the current date.

If using plastic bags, make sure to squeeze out the excess air from the bags before sealing them.

, Place the container in the back of the freezer, at the coldest spot. Store it in the freezer at 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) for as long as 10 to 12 months.

When you are ready to thaw the rhubarb, defrost it in the refrigerator or in the microwave.

, Combine 2 cups (500 ml) with 4 to 6 cups (1 to 1.5 L) of water in a small saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture boils. Continue boiling and stirring until the sugar completely dissolves.

Sugar can improve the flavor, stabilize the color, and retain the shape of the rhubarb. The solution can also help prevent drying, freezer burn, and oxidation.
You could use an artificial sweetener instead of sugar, in equal quantities, if you would prefer to skip the sugar.
If you would prefer not to use the stove, you can microwave the syrup in 30-second intervals, instead.

, Place the syrup in the refrigerator for an hour or so, or until it is cool to the touch.

The syrup should be as cool as possible. It is recommended that you make the syrup the night before and let it cool overnight, but a few hours will usually be enough if that is all you have.

, Place the cut rhubarb in freezer-safe plastic containers, packing it in firmly but leaving a minimum 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace at the top., Cover the rhubarb with the cooled syrup, making sure that the rhubarb is completely submerged and that the 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) headspace is still being maintained.

If working with a pint (1/2 L) of rhubarb, you will only need about 1/2 cup (125 ml) of syrup. If working with a quart (1 L) of rhubarb, you will need between 2/3 and 1 cup (170 to 250 ml) of syrup.
Keep 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of headspace for a 1 pint (1/2 L) container and 1 inch (2.5 cm) of headspace for a 1 quart (1 L) container.

, Seal the container and label it with the amount of rhubarb and the current date. Place it in the coldest part of the freezer and let it stay there, at 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius), for as long as 10 to 12 months.

When you are ready to thaw the rhubarb, defrost it in the refrigerator or in the microwave.

, Place the rhubarb pieces in freezer-safe plastic containers, leaving a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace or more at the top.

Juices that are low in acidity, like peach, apple, and white grape juice, are better choices than those with high acidity, like orange juice, lemon juice, or pineapple juice. The sugar in the juice works like sugar in a syrup, improving the flavor and stabilizing the color while also preventing drying and oxidation.

, Pour enough peach, apple, or white grape juice over the rhubarb to cover the pieces completely while still maintaining the 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of headspace.For a 1 pint (1/2 L) container of rhubarb, you will only need about 1/2 cup (125 ml) of syrup. For a 1 quart (1 L) container of rhubarb, you will need between 2/3 and 1 cup (170 to 250 ml) of juice.
Keep 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of headspace for a 1 pint (1/2 L) container and 1 inch (2.5 cm) of headspace for a 1 quart (1 L) container.

, Seal the container and label it with the amount of and the current date. Let it freeze quickly in the coldest part of the freezer, then keep it at a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) for as long as 10 to 12 months.

When you are ready to thaw the rhubarb, defrost it in the refrigerator or in the microwave.

Avoid freezing your custard- or cream- based pies, if possible.,
Freeze the pie in two parts.,
Thaw the custard filling in your refrigerator.If you thaw the custard, cream, or pumpkin filling at room temperature, the filling will become watery and may result in a soggy pie.,
Bake the pie crust first and then add the filling and finish baking the pie.",How to Freeze Pies2," Pies that lack a firm filling—such as fruits or nuts—are more difficult to successfully freeze. Due to their liquid consistency, custard and cream pies can make the pie crust soggy.If you were planning to freeze your custard pies for a short amount of time, consider refrigerating them instead.
Meringue pies—such as lemon meringue—are also difficult to freeze, for the same reasons. Try to serve these fresh to maintain the taste and consistency of the pies.

, The primary problem with freezing custard or cream pies is that the custard or cream filling will break down and become soggy, rendering the crust soggy as well.Avoid this problem by freezing the custard filling separately from the pie crust.

Freeze the baked pie crust (do not freeze raw dough).
Freeze the custard, cream, or pumpkin filling in an airtight plastic container; a Tupperware would do nicely.
Avoid freezing pumpkin pies for more than 4-5 weeks.

,

Give your custard or cream filling about 24 hours to thaw fully in your refrigerator.

, Unlike baking a fruit or nut pie, you should not bake the custard filling in a raw pie crust. After your pie filling has finished thawing for 24 hours, pull the frozen crust out from your freezer. Bake the pie crust until it is golden brown, then add the custard, cream, or pumpkin filling and finish making the pie as the recipe suggests."

Prepare your pie for baking.,
Bake your pie before serving.",How to Freeze Pies3," If you are making a two-crust pie (one crust beneath the filling, and one crust on top), roll out both parts of the crust as usual. Press the lower crust into the pie pan, and gently set the top crust onto a sheet of wax paper. Put both the pan (with the lower crust) and the wax paper sheet (with the top crust) into the refrigerator until both halves of the crust are completely chilled.Make the pie filling, and put that in the refrigerator to chill as well.

, Once the crusts and filling have chilled completely, put the pie together as you normally would: spoon the filling into the lower crust, and add the top crust last, then crimp the edges.

Do not add any slits in the top of the pie crust. While these play an important role in baking a pie, they will lower the quality and taste of your unbaked, frozen pie.

, Two to three layers should be sufficient.To make sure that your pie is airtight and will freeze well, you should further protect it by placing the pie inside two large ziplock bags.

Make sure to squeeze all of the air out of the plastic wrap and ziplock bags when you put the pie in the freezer.

, Once you are ready to bake and eat your pie, pull it out from the freezer and unwrap the layers of plastic wrap and ziplock bags. At this point, you should cut slits in the top of your pie to help it bake better.

Do not thaw the frozen pie before baking.

, Preheat your oven to 425°, and gently set your pie on the center shelf. Bake for 15 minutes—then reduce the oven’s heat to 375° and bake for 30-45 minutes longer.At this point, your pie will be fully cooked and ready to serve.

Alternately, you can thaw the pie at room temperature for an hour rather than baking at 425°. After it’s thawed, bake your pie in the oven at 375° for 30-45 minutes.

Transfer the peaches to the ice water.",How to Freeze Peaches1," Pick out peaches that are fragrant and slightly soft to the touch. When you press them gently your finger should slightly indent the peach, but not puncture the skin. Look for peaches with no bruises or holes.









Get peaches at the height of peach season, rather than too soon or too late in the season. Peach season is different in various regions.
Peaches that ripen on the tree and were grown nearby will have more flavor than commercially-grown, grocery store-ripened peaches. Look for peaches in your local farmer's market, or go to a pick-your-own peach farm to collect your own.;
, Fill a large pot 3







, Fill a large bowl with a tray of ice cubes and plenty of water. This ice bath will be used to cool the peaches down after blanching, so they don't keep cooking and turn mushy.








, Take a sharp knife and make an ""X"" at the top of each of the peaches. This will make it easier to remove the peaches' skin after they have been blanched.








, Use a slotted spoon to lower them in. Blanch four or so peaches at a time and leave them in the water for 40 seconds.

Peel the squash.,
Cut the squash into chunks.,
Tray freeze the squash.,
Transfer the squash to a freezer-safe container.,
Freeze for long-term storage.",How to Freeze Fresh Squash1," Use a vegetable peeler the remove the skin from the squash.


An easier way to remove the skin involves the use of a knife.

Cut the rounded ends off the squash so that the top and bottom become flat.
Hold the squash upright on your cutting board with one flat surface on the board and the other facing you.
Hold the squash steady with one hand. Use the other hand to slice just beneath the skin on one portion of the squash. Slice all the way down the length of the squash until this strip is completely removed.
Continue slicing off other strips of skin in this manner until you make it all the way around the squash.

;
, Use a serrated kitchen knife to cut the squash into evenly-sized pieces. You can cut the pieces into any size, but 1 inch (2.5 cm) cubes are a safe bet if you do not have a specific size or use in mind.

, Spread the pieces of squash onto a baking sheet in a single layer. Place this baking sheet in the freezer and allow the squash to freeze solid for several hours.It is important the the pieces do not overlap or touch during this step. Tray freezing is done so that the pieces can each freeze individually and apart from one another. By freezing the pieces this way, the squash is less likely to stick together in long-term frozen storage. If the squash chunks touch during tray freezing, however, they will still end up freezing together.

, Take the individually frozen pieces of squash and place them into a freezer-safe plastic container or plastic bag. Leave 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace before sealing the container.


The headspace is important because it provides room for possible expansion. The squash can expand as it freezes, and if you pack the container or bag to the very top, it might break if the squash applies enough pressure against it as it expands.

, Place the containers of squash in the freezer and store them there until you are ready to use the vegetable in a dish.


Frozen squash can last for 10 to 12 months.
You can add these chunks of squash directly to your dishes when ready to use or you can thaw them out first. Determine which option is best depending on the specific recipe you are working with.

Avoid opening and closing freezer repeatedly.,
Store your meat and poultry at a constant temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit to maintain their quality.,
Scrutinize your meat to see if you can detect freezer burn.,
Store cured meats for 1-2 months only.,
Refreeze your refrigerated raw meat safely.,
Refreeze any cooked meats within 3 to 4 days.",How to Freeze Meat," You should store fresh, raw meats in your refrigerator for no more than 2-3 days before freezing them.


Your refrigerator’s temperature should be kept at 40 degrees F or below at all times to ensure peak freshness and safety of all foods.Be ready to prepare the meat quickly so it will stay cold until you freeze it.;
, The packaging from the grocery store is not resistant to vapor or moisture, so just discard it.


Freezing the meat in the store packaging may cause it develop freezer burn more quickly., Use a sharp knife to cut the meat. Remove any unnecessary bones, as they take up freezer space.When cutting poultry, keep the deboned meat separate from the meat with bones.If you are freezing ground hamburger, you can divide it into 1 pound increments, or form it into quarter pound patties.
Do not rinse the meat before freezing. It isn’t necessary, and can cause crystallization on the meat when it freezes. If you want to rinse the meat, do it right before cooking., If you are using freezer paper, make sure that the paper side is touching the counter and the meat is resting on the waxed side.


Freezer paper is similar to wax paper. It has a plastic or wax coating on one side, which helps keep meat juices from leaking out. Meat markets and grocery stores use this paper to wrap raw meats in.If you can’t find freezer paper, regular wax paper, parchment paper, or even plastic wrap will do., If any bones pierce the wrap, air will get into the packaging and compromise the quality of the meat.Wrap small pieces of paper towel around the bones, then continue to wrap as instructed.

, Bring the top and bottom of the freezer paper or plastic wrap together over the meat, then fold the freezer paper down towards the meat, making small folds, each 1⁄2 to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm)., Smooth to remove as much air as possible. If wrapping in freezer, wax, or parchment paper, use freezer tape to seal the paper securely around the meat., This step is optional, but double-wrapping will help keep air away from the meat and cut down on the risk of freezer burn.If storing the meat in a plastic bag, make sure to push all air out of the bag before closing.
In the plastic bag, place each individual patty or piece of meat between two pieces of freezer paper to help keep them separate when they’re frozen. This will make them easier to quickly grab from the freezer, and it will also speed the thawing process., Then you can place it into a large plastic freezer bag, or wrap it tightly in freezer paper and tape it closed to seal.Store the giblets, heart, and liver separately in a large plastic zip-top bag for freezing.
If you’re storing the chicken right in a plastic bag, be sure to force all of the air in the bag to escape before zipping it closed.

, The date lets you know how long each piece of meat has been frozen, and the contents let you know what cut of meat you’re grabbing from the freezer without opening the package.


Permanent marker works on freezer paper, plastic bags, parchment paper, wax paper, and aluminum foil.

, This is the ideal temperature for keeping meats safely frozen. The refrigerator freezer will work just fine.Avoid freezing large quantities of meat together, as it will slow down freezing process.

, Separate the pieces or bags to allow the meat to freeze faster. Once the meat is completely frozen, you can rearrange the layout of the freezer.


If the meat doesn’t freeze quickly enough, ice crystals can form in the meat. These crystals contribute to freezer burn and to the loss of juices while the meat is thawing out., Your freezer should maintain a temperature of 0 degrees or lower at almost all times in order to keep the meat at its best.


If you’re only freezing your meat for a short amount of time (a couple of weeks), it’s okay if the freezer’s temperature fluctuates a little from the door opening and closing. Just be sure to eat the meat quickly.

, Freezing will keep foods safe almost indefinitely, however the length of time the food is frozen can have an effect on its quality.If you want to freeze your meat long-term (over a month), but your refrigerator freezer can’t maintain at least 0 degrees, you may want to consider buying a small, separate freezer for long-term cold storage.Well-wrapped meats can be frozen for 6 months to a year.Frozen meats can be stored for up to 3 months with almost no breach in quality, but after 3 months, there is a higher chance of developing freezer burn. This is especially true if they are kept in a freezer that doesn’t maintain 0 degrees F.Chicken that is wrapped well can be frozen for up to 9 months., Look for browning on the meat, smell it for a sharp frozen smell, and look for any ice crystals.

, The extra salt in cured meats causes the meat to turn rancid more rapidly, so they must be eaten more quickly.This is true for meats like ham and bacon.

, If you thaw your meat out and decide not to use it all, you can safely refreeze the raw meat, as long as it has thawed inside of the refrigerator.


Keep in mind that the quality might not be as good after refreezing the meat, as thawing causes loss of moisture., Never refreeze anything left outside of the refrigerator for more than 2 hours."

",How to Freeze Hot or Sweet Peppers1," Choose peppers at the peak of their season, usually in late summer or early fall. Look for peppers with bright colors and firm flesh. Avoid limp or bruised peppers.;
, Take care to remove all dirt, debris and traces of pesticides. Drain the peppers in the colander.

,


For sweet peppers, try to cut just around the circumference of the stem, to preserve as much of the pepper as possible.
If you're sensitive to the oils produced by hot peppers, wear plastic gloves or cover your hands in plastic wrap to protect them.

,


Make sure to remove the white membranes that the seeds are attached to.
The seeds are the hottest part of hot peppers, so be careful when you're handling them.
Rinse and drain the peppers to make sure all the seeds are removed.







,


Think ahead to the meals you'll be making with the peppers when considering what shape and size to make them.
Consider freezing some sweet and hot peppers whole in case you want to roast or stuff them.

,


Ensure that the pepper pieces aren't overlapping, or they may freeze together.
If you wish, you can cover the baking sheets with plastic wrap before placing them in the freezer.

, Leave them there until they are frozen solid.

Use peppers that are as fresh as possible. Peppers harvested directly from your garden work best, but you can also buy them at the store as long as you choose peppers that are in good shape.
If you cannot freeze the green peppers immediately, refrigerate them temporarily and freeze them within a day.
Do not use green peppers that have weak coloring, soft spots, or other rotted spots. Stay away from peppers that are overripe or those that have been sitting out for several days.;
, Rinse the peppers under cold or lukewarm running water.









Scrub them gently with your fingers to remove any stuck-on dirt. Avoid scrubbing the peppers with a vegetable brush since the harsh bristles may bruise or otherwise damage the skin.
Dry well with clean paper towels.

, At minimum, the stems and seeds should be removed and the peppers should be cut in halves.









Use a sharp paring knife to cut around the stem. Slowly lift the stem out, removing the majority of the seeds in the process.
Cut the green pepper in half widthwise, from side to side. Rinse each half with water to remove any loose seeds. If needed, you may use the paring knife to cut away any remaining sections with attached seeds.
You can leave the green peppers as halves or you can cut them into smaller pieces. For instance, you can dice them, chop them into 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) pieces, cut them into skinny strips, or slice them into thin rings. The exact cut is a matter of preference and should be determined based on the form you will need to green peppers to be in after thawing them out.

, Only blanch the peppers if you plan on cooking them after thawing them out.









If you plan on using the green peppers in fresh, uncooked dishes, do not blanch them. Skip the blanching process entirely and go directly to the freezing process. Green peppers that are frozen raw have a crisper texture when thawed.Blanching is an important process if you plan on using the green peppers in cooked foods, however. Blanching removes enzymes and bacteria that destroy nutrients, flavor, and color over time. As a result, your peppers will retain their present condition and value longer in the freezer.

, Set the water to boiling over high heat on the stove.









The stockpot should be about 2/3 full of water. If the water level decreases significantly during the blanching process, add more hot water to return the level to 2/3 full.
Give the water time to reach a rolling boil before you press forward.

, Dump a tray of ice cubes, or roughly one dozen cubes, into a large bowl. Fill the bowl with cold water until it appears roughly 2/3 full.









Continue adding ice as necessary to maintain the necessary cold temperature throughout the process.
Use a bowl that is at least as large as the stockpot.

, Transfer the peppers to the boiling water and let them sit there for a brief period.









Green pepper halves should be blanched for 3 minutes. Strips, pieces, or rings only need to go for 2 minutes.Begin timing the blanching process as soon as you add the peppers to the water.
The same water can be used to blanch five different batches.

, As soon as the green peppers have finished being blanched, transfer them from the boiling water to the ice water using a slotted spoon.









The ice water quickly drops the temperature of the peppers, stopping the cooking process.
Allow the peppers to cool for the same length of time they were blanched.

, Transfer the green peppers to a colander and let drain until dry.









Alternatively, remove them from the ice water with a slotted spoon and lay them out on layers of clean paper towel.

, Position the green pepper halves or pieces so that they are in a single layer and do not overlap or touch one another.









This step makes it possible to measure out or use some of the pepper pieces from your batch without using the entire batch.
If the green peppers touch each other as they freeze, they will stick together, making it impossible to separate individual pieces without thawing them first.

,









Frozen solid means that the green peppers cannot be broken or cut using a knife.
The process can take a couple of hours. Larger pieces and halves will take longer to freeze than smaller pieces.

, Scoop the frozen green peppers from the baking sheet and transfer them to a freezer-safe resealable plastic bag or a freezer-safe plastic container.









If you blanched the peppers beforehand, leave 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) of empty headspace at the top of the container to allow the peppers room to expand as they freeze. If you did not blanch the peppers, however, you do not need to leave any headspace.
Glass containers are not recommended since they tend to break and shatter in the freezer.
If packaging the green peppers in plastic bags, squeeze out as much excess air from the bag as possible before sealing it. Excess air is more likely to lead to freezer burn.
Vacuum-sealed bags are ideal, but not necessary.
Label the bag or container with the current date so that you will be able to keep track of how long the peppers are in the freezer.

, Thaw them out before use or cook straight from the frozen state.









Green peppers that were not blanched can be stored up to 8 months.
Green peppers that were blanched can be stored 9 to 14 months, depending on how airtight the seal is and how cold the freezer is kept.

, Stuff hollowed out green peppers with a mixture made of ground meat, rice, and tomato sauce. Freeze the peppers until ready to serve.









Combine 1 lb (450 g) of ground beef or bulk sausage, 1 minced garlic clove, 1 tsp (5 ml) of salt, 16 oz (500 ml) of tomato sauce, 1 cup (250 ml) chopped onions, 2 cups (500 ml) shredded mozzarella cheese, and 2 cups (500 ml) cooked rice. Mix the ingredients together in a large bowl.
Blanch 6 to 8 green peppers. Remove the tops of the peppers and the seeds. Cook them in boiling water for 3 minutes.
Stuff the peppers with the meat mixture. Use equal amounts of the mixture in each pepper.
Place the stuffed green peppers on a baking sheet and freeze for several hours or until frozen solid.
Wrap the individually frozen peppers with plastic wrap, arrange them in a freezer-safe plastic container, and return them to the freezer for several months.
When ready to serve, remove the plastic wrap and bake the stuffed green peppers partially thawed at 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius) for 30 to 45 minutes., Roast and puree the green peppers to create space-saving green pepper patties.









Wash the peppers and remove the seeds.
After drizzling the green peppers with olive oil, roast them at 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius) for 50 to 60 minutes.
Cool the roasted green peppers slightly before pureeing them in a food processor or blender.
Spoon small piles of green pepper puree onto a baking sheet lined with wax paper or parchment paper.
Freeze the patties for an hour or two until frozen solid.
Slide the green pepper patties off the cookie sheet using a flat spatula. Transfer them into an airtight, freezer-safe plastic bag or container.
Freeze up to 12 months or until ready to use.
When ready to use, add these green pepper patties to soups, stews, sauces, salsas, chilli, or other liquids. The patties with dissolve upon cooking, giving the dish the flavor of roasted peppers.

Cut the squash into pieces.,
Cook the squash.,
Separate the skins from the flesh.,
Mash the squash.,
Pack the squash into freezer-safe containers.,
Freeze for long-term storage.",How to Freeze Fresh Squash2," Use a serrated kitchen knife to cut the squash into halves, slices, or cubes. The best option will depend on the size of the squash.


Usually, a larger squash, like butternut squash, is easier to cook when cut into slices or cubes. If the squash is small enough, though, like most acorn squash are, you can likely get away with cutting it into halves or quarters.

, You can cook the squash in the microwave, in the oven, or on the stove. The choice is entirely up to you. Regardless, you need to cook the squash until the flesh is soft enough to pierce with a fork.


Microwave the squash.To do this, place the squash pieces in a microwave-safe glass container with 2 inches (5 cm) of water. Cook it for 15 minutes on high. Check the squash, and continue cooking in 5 minute intervals until the flesh is soft enough to scoop out.
Roast the squash. Place the squash in a glass casserole dish with 1/4 inch (0.625 cm) of water. Cover with aluminum foil and bake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius) for 45 to 60 minutes, or until soft enough to peel the flesh away from the skin.
Boil the squash. Boil 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water in a saucepan. Add the squash and cook, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes, or until tender.
Steam the squash. Fill a pan of water with 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of water and rest a steam basket on top of it. Place the squash in the steamer basket, cover, and heat the water to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, then cook the squash 7 to 15 minutes., Use your fingers to peel the skin off the flesh of the squash or use a metal spoon to dig the softened flesh out of the skin.


Place the softened flesh in a large bowl and discard the hollowed out skin when done.

, Mash the squash with a potato masher or metal fork until there are very few chunks remaining.


Alternatively, you can puree the squash using a handheld blender for an even smoother option. Both mashed and pureed squash freeze well.

, Wait for the squash to cool. Once it does, spoon it into freezer-safe plastic containers or plastic bags. Leave 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace at the top of the container.


The headspace is important because it gives the squash room to expand as it freezes. Without this empty space, the squash could end up cracking or bursting the container it is in due to the pressure that will be created as it expands.
Alternatively, you can also freeze the squash in ice cube trays or muffin tins. Scoop the mashed squash into these containers and freeze until solid. Then, transfer these individually frozen proportions to a larger freezer bag or container for long-term storage.

, Place the containers of squash in your freezer and save until ready to use.


Frozen squash can usually last for about 10 to 12 months without losing its flavor.

"
"
Peel the squash.,
Grate the flesh.Grate the remaining flesh of the squash into fine shreds using a box grater.,
Pack the squash into freezer-safe containers.,
Freeze for long-term storage.",How to Freeze Fresh Squash3," Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin from the squash.


An easier way to remove the skin involves the use of a knife.

Cut the rounded ends off the squash so that the top and bottom become flat.
Hold the squash upright on your cutting board with one flat surface on the board and the other facing you.
Hold the squash steady with one hand. Use the other hand to slice just beneath the skin on one portion of the squash. Slice all the way down the length of the squash until this strip is completely removed.
Continue slicing off other strips of skin in this manner until you make it all the way around the squash.



,


Remove any large, hard seeds from the squash as you come across them while grating.

, Place the shredded squash into freezer-safe plastic containers or plastic bags. Leave 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace at the top of the container before sealing it.


This headspace can be very important, so you really do need to include it. Headspace gives the squash room to expand as it freezes. Without that empty space, the pressure of expanding squash can cause the container you put it in to burst or crack.

, Place the containers of squash in your freezer. Keep them there until you are ready to use them for a dish.


Frozen summer squash should stay good for 10 to 12 months.

Wash the squash.,
Cut the squash into pieces.,
Boil water.,
Blanch the squash for three to four minutes.,
Dunk the squash in ice water.,
Tray freeze the squash.,
Pack the squash into freezer-safe containers.,
Freeze for long-term storage.",How to Freeze Fresh Squash4," Wash the squash by rinsing it under running water.


If you notice any large spots of dirt or debris that you cannot scrub off using your fingers, you can use a vegetable brush to clean them off. Scrub carefully to avoid breaking the skin.

, Cut the squash into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) slices. You do not need to peel the squash first.

, Boil 1 gallon (4 L) of water in a large stockpot over high heat on your stove. Place a wire basket or colander into the stockpot.


The wire basket should dip down into the water. You are not steaming the squash in this method. Instead, you are using the wire basket as a way to easily fish the squash out of the water when ready. The cut pieces still need to be immersed in the boiling water, though.

, Place no more than 1 lb (450 g) of squash in the boiling water at a time. Cook for roughly three minutes., Remove the squash from the stockpot using the wire basket. Immediately transfer the squash into a large bowl of ice water and keep it there for another three minutes.


Dunking the squash in ice water after you blanched it can stop the cooking process, thereby preventing the enzymes from breaking down any further. As a result, you are left with squash that retains its color, flavor, and most of its texture.

, Spread the pieces of squash over a baking sheet in a single layer. Place this baking sheet in the freezer and let the squash remain there for a couple of hours, or until the pieces are frozen solid.


Consider protecting the squash as it tray freezes by covering the top with a sheet of plastic wrap.
Tray freezing the squash first allows the pieces to freeze individually. Once the pieces are frozen solid, they are much less likely to stick together when frozen as a mass for long-term storage.
Do not allow the pieces of squash to overlap or touch as you tray freeze them. If they touch, they will end up sticking together, which defeats the purpose of tray freezing.

, Fill freezer-safe plastic containers or plastic bags with the squash, leaving 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) of empty headspace at the top of the container.


If you do not leave adequate headspace, the squash could end up breaking the container as it expands during the freezing process.

, Place the containers of squash in the freezer. Keep them there until you are ready to use them.


Frozen summer squash will usually stay good up to 10 to 12 months.

Choose the freshest food possible.,
Avoid freeze drying foods that won't taste good reconstituted.,
Process the food for freeze drying.",How to Freeze Dry1," Foods that contain high amounts of water work best for freeze drying. Their structure remains intact after the process. These foods hold up particularly well:

Fruits like apples, bananas, berries, persimmons and pears.
Vegetables like potatoes, peppers, carrots, sweet potatoes and parsnips.
After you're familiar with the process, try freeze-drying chicken breasts, cheese, and even entire meals, like spaghetti and meatballs. Any food that contains moisture can be preserved using the freeze-drying process.;
, Freeze drying food at the peak of its ripeness or freshness helps make sure it will taste good when it's reconstituted.

Fruits and vegetables should be freeze dried when they are in season and fully ripe.
Meat should be freeze dried right after it has been cooked and cooled.
Full meals should be freeze dried as soon as they have been cooked and cooled. Don't freeze dry them after storing them in the refrigerator for a few days, or they'll taste like leftovers when you reconstitute them.

, Berries and apples don't need to be reconstituted - the freeze-dried version of these fruits tastes good as it is. Freeze dried meat or spaghetti, on the other hand, will need to be reconstituted with moisture in order to be edible. Don't freeze dry foods for which this won't be possible.

Bread is not a good choice for freeze drying since its texture is so dependent on freshness.
Cake, cookies and other yeast-based foods are not good candidates for freeze drying.

, Get the food ready to be preserved by doing the following:

If applicable, wash and dry the food thoroughly.
Slice the food into small pieces. Cut apples, peppers, potatoes and other fruit and vegetables into small chunks, so that the moisture is easily removed.

Crack the eggs into a bowl.,
Beat the eggs together gently.,
Add another ingredient to prevent graininess (recommended).,
Strain to improve uniformity (optional).,
Freeze in freezer-safe containers.,
Label the container with three important facts.",How to Freeze Eggs1," Always begin by cracking open the eggs into a large bowl or other container. Raw egg, just like any material that contains significant amounts of water, will expand when frozen. If the eggs are frozen in the shell, this expansion could crack open the egg. Besides mixing shell fragments into the edible part of the egg, this could introduce harmful bacteria from the outside of the shell.If the eggs are near or past their expiration date, crack each one into a ""test bowl"" before transferring to the larger container. Discard eggs with obvious discoloration or a strong, unpleasant smell, then wash the test bowl before cracking the next egg.;
, Mix at least enough to break the egg yolks, or create a more uniform substance by beating them together until blended. However, try not to beat too much air into the eggs., Raw egg yolks tend to become gelatinous when frozen. When mixed with egg white, this can cause a grainy texture in the frozen egg mixture. There are two main ways to prevent this, depending on your intended use for the eggs. If you are using them alone or in savory dishes, stir in 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) of salt for each cup (240 mL) of raw egg.If you are using them in sweet dishes, instead stir in 1 – 1.5 tbsp (15 – 22 mL) of sugar, honey, or corn syrup., If you want to make the mixture more consistent, strain it through a sieve or colander over a clean bowl. This will also remove most shell fragments if any were mixed into the egg while cracking them.

, Pour the mixture into freezer-safe containers, leaving 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of space between the egg and the lid to allow for expansion. Tightly seal the containers.


Alternatively, freeze the egg mixtures in a clean ice cube tray first, then pop the cubes out into a larger, freezer-safe container. This may make it easier to thaw the amount of egg you need., The eggs typically remain high quality for several months to a year, so it's a good idea to label them rather than relying on your memory.Remember to include:


The date you froze them.
The number of eggs you froze.
The additional ingredient you mixed in (if applicable). This helps you avoid the unpleasant surprise of using sugary eggs in a savory dish.

When bringing it home from the market, keep it in a cooler or a freezer bag to help maintain it's freshness, along with some ice or frozen food., Ice is the most effective way to cool down fish to take home from fishing. You can even use ice to kill small fish, as it almost immediately immobilizes them. Use crushed ice for this purpose. For every 1 pound of fish you have, you need at least 2 pounds of ice., For smaller fish, just set the fish (alive) into the ice as they would be in the water. That is, place them like they're swimming, not on their sides., Slice off the head at the gills.Scale the fish. Use the back of a knife. Grasp the tail. Run the back of the knife up under the scales as you move towards the front of the fish. Continue running the knife over the fish until the scales are gone, rinsing the scales off the knife as you go. Once you've cleaned out the inside of the fish, pack it with ice.

,, You can also use paper towels. You will want to ensure they are completely dry before freezing so that the water doesn't freeze and ruin the taste.


Allow them to sit on the towel and air dry. Patting them can crush them, in which case you will lose some of the original flavor.

, It is a good idea to chop them to the size you usually use in cooking. You will be able to take the chopped chives directly from the refrigerator and use them in your recipes.

, Try to smooth them into 1 horizontal layer for easy handling. Compress the bag before sealing to extract all of the air.

, Leave them there overnight.

, For example, you can take very small lunch bags and freeze a portion. Then, you can remove a lunch bag each time your recipe calls for fresh chives.


Chives thaw quickly, so take care to repackage them within a few minutes of removing them from the freezer.






This step is not necessary if you want to keep all the chives in the same bag. Opening and closing the bags will insert oxygen into the bag, so they may not taste as fresh.







, There is no need to thaw the chives, as they will do so quickly.

, Tip the cherries into a colander. Wash under running water, hand picking out any debris that you can see.


Use cold water only for rinsing.
Decide now whether you want to pit and de-stem the cherries or not.

, Let dry before proceeding. Place on absorbent paper to wick away the moisture. Gently pat dry with a paper towel.

, If adding to a resealable freezer bag, pack as tightly as possible and try to gently expel excess air without squashing the cherries. If adding to a freezer-proof container with lid, add as many cherries as possible before putting the lid on.

, Let freeze. Leave space around the bag (if using one) to allow for expansion while freezing.

, Use as many or as few of the cherries as needed each time; simply pull away the amount you want. Return the rest of the cherries to the freezer before they start to thaw.

, For baking and other recipes, you will likely also need to remove the pit.

Pick out fresh cauliflower.,
Wash the cauliflower.,
Remove all leaves.,
Cut the cauliflower.,
Soak the florets in brine.,
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.,
Make an ice bath.,
Place the cauliflower in the boiling water.,
Transfer the cauliflower to the ice bath.,
Portion the cauliflower into freezer-safe containers.,
Freeze the cauliflower.,
Reheat the cauliflower when you're ready to use it.",How to Freeze Cauliflower," Pick young, fresh cauliflower at its peak to freeze. The florets should be tight and white. Avoid heads with brown spots or limp parts. When you thaw cauliflower that was frozen after its peak, you won't be impressed with the flavor and texture.


You can pick your own cauliflower or buy it from a farmer's market for optimum freshness.
Avoid freezing very large heads or heads that have already been stored at room temperature for awhile.;
, Use cool running water to rinse away any dirt, bugs and pesticides that have gotten trapped in the cauliflower's tight florets. If you picked the cauliflower, you might want to submerge it in a bowl of warm water to make sure you wash out all the nooks and crannies. Watch carefully, as spiders like to hide in between the flowers.

, The green leaves can be discarded. Only the white florets will be frozen.

, Use a sharp knife to trim away any brown spots. Cut the cauliflower into 1-inch florets for easy freezing. You can also use your hands to split the florets apart.


If you prefer, you can cut the cauliflower into larger or smaller pieces.
Think ahead about what you might make with the cauliflower when you're deciding how to cut it. If you anticipate using it to make cauliflower soup, it doesn't matter whether the pieces are uniform, since they'll be pureed. If you're going to use it to make a roasted cauliflower side dish, you might want to make the pieces more uniform for a prettier presentation.

, If you're worried that the cauliflower florets might contain insects - a common issue with freshly-picked cauliflower - you can take the extra precaution of soaking them in brine. Fill a large bowl with a gallon of tap water and 4 teaspoons of salt. Soak the cauliflower florets for 30 minutes. Any insects will float to the top.Discard the brine and rinse the cauliflower once more.

, Blanching cauliflower will destroy enzymes that cause it to break down and lose its color and flavor. To blanch cauliflower, bring enough water to cover the cauliflower to a rolling boil in a large pot.Neglecting to blanch the cauliflower before freezing it will probably result in mushy, discolored cauliflower when you thaw it later. It's worth the effort to blanch it first.

, While the water is coming to a boil, place ice cubes and water in a bowl large enough to hold the cauliflower. You'll plunge the blanched cauliflower into the water after boiling it to immediately stop it from overcooking.

, Boil it for 3 minutes, which is long enough to kill the enzymes that ruin the cauliflower's flavor over time. If you have too much cauliflower to fit in the pot all at once, blanch it in patches.

, Use a slotted spoon to move it from the pot to the bath of ice, to stop it from overcooking. After about 3 minutes, you can drain the water and ice away. The cauliflower is now ready to freeze.

, Freezer bags or tubs are your best bet for frozen cauliflower. For convenience, place enough cauliflower in each container to serve as the base for a full meal. For example, if you know you want to make cauliflower soup, you could place 2 - 3 cups of cauliflower in one storage container so you'll have the exact amount you need later.


If you use freezer bags, try to squeeze out most of the air before sealing them. This will help preserve the cauliflower for a longer amount of time. You can also use a straw to suck out the excess air, then press the bag closed when you remove the straw.
A foodsaver device or vacuum sealer work well for freezing large amounts of food.

, Label your bags and place them on a shelf in your freezer. They will keep there for several months.

, Frozen cauliflower only needs to be reheated for about 90 seconds after the blanching and freezing process. Simply drop the frozen florets into boiling water, or steam them. They are now ready to use in your favorite cauliflower recipe. Here are a few to try out:

Cauliflower Soup
Cauliflower Gratin

Choose the right cheese.",How to Freeze Cheese1," Hard, very hard and semi-hard cheese will freeze, although some cheeses will be crumbly after freezing (but will still taste good). On the other hand, soft cheese does not freeze well, such as cottage cheese, ricotta cheese and cream cheese, so don't freeze these varieties. Varieties include:Very hard cheese: Pecorino, Romano Parmesan
Hard cheese: Cheddar, Swiss, Edam, Gouda and Colby
Semi-hard/soft cheese: Havarti, Monterey Jack, Mozzarella, Provolone, Brick, Camembert, Brie
Soft cheese: Ricotta, feta, cottage cheese, cream cheese.

Place the food on a plate or tray.,
Place the tray in the freezer and freeze until solid.,
Place the frozen food in the vacuum chamber pulled to about 120 m Torr.,Place the food in air-tight containers for storage.",How to Freeze Dry4," Spread it out so that the pieces of food are not clumped together., If possible, make sure the freezer is empty of other items.

Don't open the freezer much while the food is freezing. This will slow the freezing process, and cause ice crystals to develop on the food.
If you have a deep freezer, use it. The food should be frozen at the lowest temperature possible.

, Set the temperature to 10 °C (50 °F).

The sublimation process should be complete within a week depending on the set parameters.
Check one of the slices after waiting the proper time to make sure the freeze-drying is complete.

Freeze the egg whites.",How to Freeze Eggs2," Break the eggshell carefully in half, without dropping any egg. Transfer the raw egg back and forth between the two halves, letting the white drip bit by bit into a bowl until only the yolk remains in the shell. There are several other methods you may use instead.

, Raw egg yolk will become gelatinous when frozen, making them unusable in most recipes and unpleasant for most people to eat. Prevent this process by mixing it with another ingredient. Use 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) of salt for each cup (240 mL) of raw egg if you plan to use the eggs in savory dishesIf using them for sweet dishes such as baked desserts, skip the salt and instead stir in 1 – 1.5 tbsp (15 – 22 mL) of sugar, honey, or corn syrup., Store the mixed yolk mixture in freezer safe containers, leaving 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of space to allow for expansion. Seal the containers tightly before freezing, and label with the number of eggs used, the date frozen, and the type of mixture (savory or sweet).


Use the egg yolks within several months for best quality.

, Mix the egg whites together to create a more uniform mixture, without introducing too many air bubbles into the mixture. Unlike the egg yolks, raw egg white does not require any additional ingredients to maintain a high quality in the freezer for several months.


If the mixture is still too chunky or uneven for your preferences, strain it through a sieve over a clean bowl.

, As with the yolks, these should be stored in specialized freezer-safe, rigid plastic or glass containers. Leave 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of space to allow for expansion. Seal tightly and label with number of eggs and date frozen.


Any type of raw egg can be poured into a clean ice cube tray first, then transferred to a sealed container in the freezer. This makes it easier to remove only the amount of egg you need for a given recipe."

Freeze fish fillets in bags.,
Dip whole fish.,
Spread out the frozen fish in the freezer.,
Write the date on the package.,
Keep the fish in the bag or paper to thaw.",How to Freeze Fish2," Fillet the fish. Holding the tail, cut under the fillet just above the backbone, moving towards the head. Once you cut the fillet off, use your knife to remove the skin, if desired. Use a similar technique: start near the tail, and run the knife under the skin, moving away from you.Pop each fillet in a freezer storage bag, and push out as much air as possible. The bag should seal around the fish as closely as possible., If you are freezing whole fish (minus the guts and scales), you need to dip the fish in saltwater before freezing. The water helps it build a glaze to protect the fish.Pre-freeze a baking pan by placing it in the freezer for 5 minutes. Stir a teaspoon of salt into a quart of water until the salt dissolves.Dip the fish quickly, and set them on the tray. Place the tray quickly back into the freezer.Once the ice has frozen on the outside, repeat the process a couple of times to build up a layer.Wrap the frozen fish in freezer paper. Secure with tape. Place them back in the freezer., You want to freeze the fish as quickly as possible, and spreading the fish out in the freezer is the easiest way to do that., Fatty fish, such as tuna and salmon, can be frozen for about 3 months. Non-fatty fish, such as cod or flounder, can stay in the freezer for about 6 months., When thawing the fish, make sure it stays in the container it was frozen in to help maintain flavor and texture.To thaw seafood, place it in cold, running water to keep it cool while thawing out the ice."

Use a lemon-gelatin glaze.,
Try freezing fish in water.",How to Freeze Fish3," Like an ice glaze, a lemon-gelatin glaze protects the fish. Additionally, it adds flavor.Boil 1 1/2 cups of water. While it's heating, stir 1/4 cup of lemon juice into 1 3/4 cups of water, along with 1/2 cup of gelatin. Once the water boils, add in the lemon-gelatin mixture. Let it cool.Dip each fish into the glaze. After dipping, shake off the excess moisture. You don't want too thick a coating on each piece.Wrap in packaging. You can either use freezer bags or paper. Squeeze out as much air as possible. Freeze the fish., Some fish experts believe that placing fish in water, especially large containers of water, can damage fish fillets. To be on the safe side, use a small container with just enough water to cover the fish, or stick to freezing small, whole fish, as the skin offers some protection.Use plain, very cold water. You can also use slightly salted water.Pour the water in a shallow pan or freezer bags.Add the fillets or small fish. Dump the fish in the water, making sure it covers all parts of the fish.Freeze the fish. Cover the pans, or seal the bags. Place the pans or bags in the freezer, and let them freeze. Don't forget to label the fish with a date.If using a pan, take the block of ice and fish out of the pan after freezing. Either put the block in a zip-top bag, or wrap it in freezer paper before putting it back in the freezer."

Cook the celery for several minutes.,
Remove the celery from the boiling water and transfer it to cold water.,
Drain and dry the celery.,
Place the celery in a freezer-proof container.,
Label the celery container and place it in the freezer.",How to Freeze Celery," When you’re planning to freeze celery, it helps to start with the best stalks. Select those that are crisp and tender because they’ll be more likely to freeze well.Avoid stalks that have coarse strings when you’re freezing celery.;
, After you’ve selected the celery stalks that you plan to freeze, clean the stalks thoroughly. Run them under cool water and scrub the surface with a vegetable brush to remove any residue. Rinse them again under cool water, and use a sharp knife to trim the base of each stalk and any strings that might be hanging off the ends.If you notice that any portions of the celery stalks are discolored, trim those away as well.

, Once the celery stalks are clean, use the knife to cut them to your desired length. If you’re not sure what recipes you plan to use the celery for in the future, chopping them into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces is usually a good size for most dishes.It can be difficult to chop celery stalks after they’ve been frozen, so it’s best to take the time to chop them now even if you aren’t exactly sure what size is right.

, Place a large stock pot on your stove, and fill it with enough water to cover all of the celery that you’re freezing. Turn the burner to high, and allow the pot to come to a full boil.When it comes to deciding how much water to add to the pot, using 1 gallon (3.8 L) for every pound (454 g) of celery is a good rule of thumb.
If you don’t plan to keep the celery in your freezer for more than two months, you don’t necessarily have to blanch it before freezing. It will help preserve the flavor more effectively, though, so you may want to do even if you plan to use it within 8 weeks.

, Once the water is boiling, place the chopped celery in the pot. Give the water a good stir after adding the celery to ensure that it’s all submerged. Let the celery cook in the boiling water for 3 minutes.Placing the celery in a boiler basket before adding it to the water makes it much easier to add it to and remove it from the water.
Set a timer when you place the celery in the water so you’re sure not to overcook it.

, When the celery has cooked for 3 minutes, take it out of the boiling water. Immediately, transfer it to a large bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Let it sit in the cold water for about 3 minutes.If you don’t want to create an ice water bath for the celery, you can place it in a colander and set it under cold running water to cool it as quickly as possible.

, After you’ve cooled the celery, dump the bowl of cold water into a colander to drain the chopped celery. Shake the colander well to remove all of the excess moisture, and then blot the celery with a clean towel or paper towel to dry it thoroughly.Be sure to dry the celery carefully. If there is excess moisture on the pieces, it can ruin the celery when you freeze it.

, When the celery is properly drained and dried, divide it into ½ pound (227 g) portions. Transfer it to freezer-proof containers, such as plastic containers or plastic freezer bags, so it’s ready to freeze.If you’re using a plastic container, make sure to leave room inside for the celery to expand.
If you’re using a freezer bag, make sure to press all of the air out before sealing it.

, Once you have the celery in the freezer containers, add a label with the contents and date so it’s easy to find and use by the right time. Place the celery in your freezer for use at a later date.Use your frozen celery within 8 to 12 months.

Learn how much egg to use.",How to Freeze Eggs4," Whether raw or cooked, frozen eggs are best thawed overnight in a cold place like the refrigerator, to avoid being exposed to bacteria. Any temperature above 39ºF (4ºC) carries significant risk of bacterial contamination for thawing food.


You may speed up the thawing process safely by placing the container under cold running water.Never attempt to cook frozen eggs directly on a frying pan or in a dish. Do not leave frozen eggs to thaw at room temperature.

, Insufficiently cooking thawed eggs can carry risk of bacteria. The internal temperature of the thawed egg or the food it is mixed into should reach at least 160ºF (71ºC).Cook thoroughly at prolonged high temperatures if you do not have a food thermometer to check the exact temperature.

, If you have extra egg yolks, consider making a custard, ice cream, or scrambled eggs. Use up egg whites to make frosting, meringue, or white cake batter. Finally, hard boiled yolks can be crumbled on top of salads or used whole as a garnish.

, Use 3 tbsp (44 mL) thawed raw egg for each egg the recipe calls for. If the eggs were frozen separated, use 2 tbsp (30 mL) thawed raw egg white instead of the white of one egg, and 1 tbsp (15 mL) thawed raw egg yolk instead of one egg yolk.Egg sizes can vary greatly, so don't worry too much about the exact amount. If baking, you can adjust to a dry or wet dough by adding more wet or dry ingredients, respectively, to balance it out.

, Make sure you remove any dirt, bugs or traces of pesticides.


If you live in an area where pests or broccoli worms are a problem, prepare a saltwater bath and soak the broccoli for half an hour. This will kill the bugs and cause them to rise to the surface. Discard the saltwater, rinse the broccoli, and proceed.






Remove all leaves from the broccoli.







, Slice the lower stem into chunks about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick - about the thickness of a water chestnut. Discard the woody end of the stem.

, Squeeze in the juice of half a lemon, stir and let sit for about 5 minutes. Pour the lemon-water into the cooking pot.

, Using a steamer basket to measure, add enough water so that the steamer basket will sit about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the water. Remove the steamer basket after checking the water level.


If you don't have a steamer basket, just add enough water to cover the amount of broccoli you are processing.

, Covering the pot with a lid makes the water boil faster and conserves energy.

, Cover the pot and bring it back to full boil. Once boiling has resumed, steam the broccoli for 5 minutes.


If you aren't using a steamer basket, place the broccoli directly into the boiling water. Blanch it for two minutes, then remove it using a slotted spoon.

, Either place it under cold running water or plunge it into ice water.


If you aren't using a steamer basket, transfer the broccoli directly from the pot to a colander, then cool it.

, Use the steamer basket or pour the broccoli into a colander. Shake to remove excess water.

, Lay flat to freeze.

Put enough broccoli in each bag to make a meal for your family. This way you'll be able to defrost exactly as many as you need instead of the entire batch of broccoli. A rough measurement is one handful of florets per serving.






If you aren't using a vacuum sealer, close the zippered bag almost all the way. Insert a straw into the opening. Draw out the remaining air through the straw. Withdraw the straw as you finish sealing the bag.






Label the bags with the date you froze them. Use within 9 months for best taste and nutritional value.

Cut the squash in half and cut off both ends. The squash should be able to stand flat on its end.
Use a sharp chef's knife with a smooth blade to shave off the outer peel.Cut the butternut squash into cubes. For most purposes, 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes work best, but you can make the cubes larger or smaller as desired.
Remove the seeds and pulp as you cube the squash.;
, Freeze the pieces for several hours or until completely frozen solid.









Make sure that the pieces are spread out in a single layer and are not touching each other. The pieces of raw butternut squash should be frozen separately, but if they are stacked or touching, they will freeze together instead.
If you do not have parchment paper, wax paper will also work well.

, After the pieces have frozen completely, place them in a large freezer-safe plastic container.









Leave 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) empty headspace at the top of the container. As food freezes, it expands. The extra space allows the squash extra room to expand.
Avoid using glass containers since glass is more likely to shatter in the freezer.
If desired, you could also use resealable plastic bags as long as they are freezer-safe.
Mark the container with the current date so you will know, for future reference, how long the butternut squash has been in the freezer.

, Place the containers of frozen butternut squash in the freezer and store for 6 to 12 months, or until the squash shows signs of decay or freezer burn.









Frozen chunks of butternut squash can usually be used directly from the freezer, but you may also thaw them to reduce cooking time.

Harvest blueberries at their peak.,
Decide whether you want to wash the berries.,

Place the pan in the freezer until the blueberries are frozen.,
Place the frozen berries in a vacuum bag or a Ziploc type bag.,
Store the bags in the freezer.,
Thaw berries slowly.,
Finished.

",How to Freeze Blueberries," For best freezing results, freeze berries that are juicy, tender, and flavorful as can be. Freezing berries that are too tart or a little mushy will leave you disappointed in their texture and flavor when they thaw.


Harvest blueberries early in the morning - that's when their flavor is strongest.If you don't freeze blueberries right after harvesting them, keep them cool in the refrigerator until you're ready.;
, When it comes to washing blueberries before freezing, there are two camps. There is research that shows that washing blueberries prior to freezing can result in slightly tougher skin once the berries thaw. Others say the difference is imperceptible, and they'd rather not have dirt in their freezer.


If the berries are washed before frozen, you can enjoy eating a frozen one without having to thaw it.
If you're planning to use the berries in a recipe for pie or another cooked dessert, washing them before freezing shouldn't be a problem.
If you decide to wash before freezing, rinse the berries gently and let them dry completely before freezing.

, A cookie sheet or large roasting pan should do the trick. Spread them out so that they aren't piled on top of each other.

, It should take 2 - 3 hours. Don't leave the berries on the cookie sheet too long before you remove them; doing so puts them at risk of getting freezer burn.

, Remove excess air from the bag. The more air you can remove, the less freezer burn the berries will have. Label the bags with the date you're freezing them.

, You can freeze berries for up to one year. Enjoy anytime.

, The best way is to place them in the fridge or let them come to room temperature. Don't use a microwave to defrost unless you plan on cooking with them.


To use still-frozen blueberries for baking, there is no need to thaw. Simply put them straight straight into muffins and other baked goods. Bake as usual.This prevents the blueberries from being smashed while mixing them into the batter, and they end up being juicier and plumper in the finished product. They still become just as warm as the rest of the baked item.
If you decided not to wash the berries before freezing, remember to do so once they have been thawed.

The cubes must be arranged in a single layer and should not be touching one another. Otherwise, the pieces of butternut squash may end up freezing together, making them more difficult to use.

, Once the cubes are frozen solid, place them inside resealable plastic freezer bags.









You could also use freezer-safe plastic containers, but glass containers are not recommended since glass is more likely to break when frozen. Leave 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) empty headspace at the top of the container to allow the butternut squash cubes room to expand.
Label the bag or container with the current date so you will know how long the squash has been in your freezer later on.

, Butternut squash can be saved for 6 to 12 months when frozen.









Pre-cooked squash cubes are often easier to use straight from the freezer, without thawing them first, than raw squash cubes are.

Chill foods before freezing.,
Freeze food in small batches.,
Open the door as little as possible.,
Keep your freezer full.,
Encourage air flow.,
Use quality, freezer-safe containers.,
Double-wrap foods.,
Use containers of the right size for liquids.,
Cover the surface of food.,
Push out excess air from freezer bags.,
Seal containers and bags properly.,
Keep foods frozen for as little time as possible.",How to Prevent Freezer Burn," Freezer burn occurs when food in the freezer dries out. Moisture can evaporate from food when the temperature of the freezer is inconsistent. For instance, if you're always opening and closing the freezer, the temperature will fluctuate, and this will cause water to evaporate from the food.


When too much moisture evaporates from the food, the tissue dries out, and that’s what freezer burn is.The main causes of temperature fluctuations in the freezer include opening the door often, freezing too much food at once, freezing food that hasn’t been pre-chilled, and not setting the freezer to the right temperature.;
, As the name suggests, a freezer is meant to be at or below freezing temperature. If the freezer is warmer than that, it will encourage the moisture to evaporate from food faster, and this will lead to freezer burn.


For freezers with basic dials, set your freezer to Cold or Low. For freezers with temperature gauges, set it to 0ºF (-18ºC)., There are many things that can cause the temperature of your freezer to fluctuate, and putting in warm or room temperature food is one of those ways. If you put hot food in the freezer, it will increase the surrounding temperature, and this will cause evaporation and moisture loss in nearby foods.


Before transferring food or leftovers to the freezer, chill them in the fridge for one to two hours prior in order to bring down the temperature., Similarly, putting too much thawed food in the freezer at once can also increase the temperature of the freezer, and the moisture loss this causes in surrounding food will lead to freezer burn.


To help maintain the temperature in your freezer, only freeze up to three pounds (1.4 kg) of food per cubic foot of capacity at a time.This doesn’t apply for foods that are already frozen, because the freezer doesn’t have to work to equalize the temperature.

, Every time you open the door to the freezer, cold air rushes out and is replaced with warm air from the room. This not only wastes energy because the freezer has to work harder to normalize the temperature again, but it also leads to evaporation and moisture loss in the food.Never leave the door of the freezer open for longer than necessary. Organize your freezer to make it easier to find food.

, Ideally, you want to keep your freezer about 75 percent full at all times. This is because cold food will help keep other food cold, the same way that an icepack keeps food chilled in a cooler.It’s important that you don’t overstuff your freezer, however, as this will restrict ventilation, meaning the temperature inside the freezer will be inconsistent.

, Even with your freezer full, you want to leave headroom above the food and space below so air can circulate evenly. Leave about four inches (10 cm) of headspace at the top of the freezer, and a couple inches on the bottom.


If your freezer doesn’t have a shelf or rack for the bottom, consider installing one that will allow cold air to easily circulate throughout the freezer., One of the main culprits that causes freezer burn is the air, so keeping food airtight when it’s in the freezer can help prevent freezer burn. One of the easiest ways to do this is to use containers that are meant for the freezer, because they tend to be thicker, more durable, and more airtight.


The best materials for housing frozen food are plastic containers, glass containers or jars, or freezer bags. Jars are great for liquid foods, and bags and containers are ideal for solids.
Plastic wrap, waxed paper, and aluminum foil should only be used in conjunction with a proper freezer-safe container or bag.
Use glass and plastic containers with airtight lids.
For bags, choose ones that are specifically designed to be freezer bags. These tend to be made of thicker plastic and can be sealed to keep air out.
Avoid plastic wrap and Styrofoam food containers, as these aren't airtight., Another way to keep food away from exposure to the air is to double wrap it for extra protection. This is especially important for items that will be stored long-term, or that have delicate flavors that would be ruined by freezer burn.


You can double-wrap non-liquid foods like bread, baked goods, leftovers, and more. Wrap the food tightly in one to two layers of aluminum foil, waxed paper, or plastic wrap. Then, transfer the wrapped food to a sealable freezer bag.Alternatively, you can also place foods (including solids) into a freezer bag and then wrap the freezer bag with aluminum foil or plastic wrap.

, Even an airtight container will expose food to air if the container isn't full. For that reason, choose the smallest container possible to store liquid foods such as soups, sauces, and stews.Ideally, you want the food to fill the jar completely, minus about a half-inch inches (1.3 cm) for headroom.
Headroom is required in the container because liquids expand when they freeze, and if you don’t leave extra space, they will break the container or pop the lid.

, Leaving headroom in a container is sometimes necessary, but you can protect foods, liquids, and leftovers from air by covering the surface before putting on the lid.Place your food into the container, leaving headroom if necessary. Then, cut a piece of foil, plastic, or wax paper that’s large enough to cover the surface of the food, plus a few extra inches (several centimeters).
Cover the surface of the food with the paper, plastic, or foil. Press the excess up the sides of the container and over the rim.
Affix an airtight lid on the container, trapping the cover in place.

, When you store food in freezer bags, it’s important to push or suck out all the air from the bag before freezing your food. To remove as much air as possible, use vacuum freezer bags that allow you to use suction to suck all the air out of the bag. You can also remove air manually if you don’t have a vacuum system:


Place your food in the bottom of the freezer bag, and then fold the food and bag over on itself, working toward the opening.
When you get to the top of the bag, seal the bag most of the way.
Insert a straw into the bag and suck out as much air as you can. Remove the straw and quickly seal the bag the rest of the way., Going through all the effort to protect your food from air is a waste if you don’t properly seal the container the food is in. Improperly sealed containers will let air leak in, and this will lead to freezer burn.Make sure you have the right lid for your jar or container. For a press-on lid, make sure the lid is completely sealed to the container. For a screw-on lid, make sure the lid is on properly and tight.
For a freezer bag, make sure the bag is fully closed along the entire length of the seal.

, One of the biggest keys to preventing freezer burn is making sure your foods don’t stay in the freezer long enough to develop it. This will minimize the food’s exposure to air, and ensure the food is eaten when it’s still in its prime.


You can generally keep foods frozen for about nine months. After that, there's a good chance freezer burn will occur, no matter how well the food is sealed.
Rotate the food in your freezer when you add new stuff. This ensures the older food gets eaten first.It’s also a good idea to date the food you freeze, and that way you know when it should come out of the freezer.

Understand the process of freezing strawberries before choosing a method.,
Make sure the strawberries are mostly dry before freezing them, or the water will freeze on them and make them hard and unpleasant to eat.

,
If you will be storing the frozen berries for a long time, make sure to remove as much air as possible from the plastic bags and seal them thoroughly.",How to Freeze Strawberries1," Whichever method you choose, be aware that freezing doesn't sterilize strawberries; it preserves them. As such, be sure to only use the best quality strawberries and to ensure that they're well washed and dried first. Moreover, don't expect miracles from frozen strawberries. Upon thawing, they will be softer, sometimes quite mushy, and they will have darkened in color. They will also have a different taste texture from fresh strawberries. Just be aware of this and be prepared to use them in ways befitting their condition upon thawing.

,, This will help to prevent freezer burn and keep the berries fresh.


You may wish to cut the strawberries into smaller, bite-sized pieces. This can be done before freezing to lessen the freezing time needed, or after they come out of the freezer.

Peel and chop the onions.,
Place the onions in a freezer bag.,
Label the bag and freeze.",How to Freeze Onions1," To prepare the onions for freezing, use a sharp knife to cut off the top ½-inch (1.3 cm). Next, slice the onion in half. Peel off the papery skin, and then chop the onion to the size you prefer..


It’s not a good idea to chop the onions any smaller than into ½-inch (1.3 cm) pieces because they may wind up becoming encased in ice when you freeze them if they’re too small.
You can slice the onions instead of chopping them if you’re freezing them for use in dishes such as fajitas.;
, When you’ve chopped the onions to your desired size, transfer them to a plastic freezer bag. Make sure to place them in the bag in a single, flat layer to prevent them from clumping together when they freeze. Squeeze all the air out of the bag, and seal it.If you’re freezing a large number of onions, prevent them from sticking together when frozen by placing them in a single layer on a shallow baking dish. Freeze them like that for two to three hours, and when they’re partially frozen, you can place them in the freezer bag without worrying about them clumping together.
Be sure to use plastic bags that are thick enough to protect the onions from freezer burn and keep the onion scent contained in the bag. If your bags seem too thin, double them up.

, Before throwing the onions in your freezer, use a pen or marker to label the bag with the date, type of onion, and when you should use them by. Place the bag flat in the freezer, making sure that the onions are still in a single layer as you position them.You can keep onions in your freezer for up to 6 months.
If you have multiple bags of onion that you’re freezing, you can stack them on top of one another to save space in the freezer. Just make sure that the onions in each bag are in a flat, single layer.

Finished.








",How to Freeze Butternut Squash3," Use a sharp chef's knife to divide the butternut squash in half, cutting lengthwise from top to bottom.









Depending on the size of your cooking dish, you may need to cut the squash in half once more so that it will fit. Cutting the squash into quarters may also make it easier to remove the seeds.
Scoop out the seeds and pulp. Use a metal spoon, melon-baller, or metal ice cream scooper to dig out the seeds and stringy pulp.

, Arrange the squash pieces in a microwave-safe glass dish with the cut-side facing down. Add roughly 2 inches (5 cm) of water to the dish and cover.









If you do not have a big enough dish to fit the entire squash, you may need to cook it in batches. Alternatively, you can cook the squash on the stove in a stockpot filled with boiling water for approximately twice as long.

, After 15 minutes, poke the squash with a fork. If it feels soft enough to scoop out, the squash is done.









If the squash is not soft enough, continue microwaving it for 3 to 5 minutes at a time until done. This process usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes total., Use a large metal spoon to gently scoop out the cooked squash from its skin.









If cooked enough, the squash should come out of its skin with relative ease.
Let the squash cool slightly before you handle it to minimize the risk of burns. You may also want to hold the squash with an oven mitt or dish towel as you work.

, Place the squash in a bowl or container and use an electric hand blender to mash the squash until it develops a smooth consistency.









You could also use a standard blender, hand mixer, or fork to puree the squash, but a hand blender is the most convenient and quickest tool to use.

, Transfer the butternut squash puree to a freezer-safe plastic food container. Freeze up to 12 months.









Leave roughly 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) of empty headspace so that the squash has room to expand as it freezes.
This method is especially useful if you already know that you will need to use the squash in puree form.
You could also use resealable plastic freezer bags instead of the plastic container. Ice cube trays with covers or ice cube trays covered in plastic wrap will also work well.
Label the container or bag with the current date before placing it in the freezer.

Add the onions to the pot and boil for several minutes.,
Transfer the onions to a bowl of cold water.,
Drain the onions and place them in freezer bags.",How to Freeze Onions2," Prepare the onions by trimming off the top and the bottom with a sharp knife. Next, remove the papery skin by peeling it off. Use the knife to chop the onions to the size that you prefer., Fill a large stockpot with water, and place it on the stove. Set the burner to high, and allow the water to come to a full boil, which should take approximately 10 to 20 minutes depending on how much water you’re using.The amount of water that you should boil depends on how many onions you’re blanching. For every pound (373 g), use 1 (3.8 l) gallon of water.

, Once the water has come to a boil, place the onions in the pot. Cover the pot, and allow the onions to cook for 3 to 7 minutes, depending on how many you’re blanching.The more onions that you’re blanching, the longer you should leave them in the boiling water.
With chopped onions, it’s easier to place them in a wire basket or perforated metal strainer and then set them in the boiling water. That way, you can quickly and easily remove them when they’re done. If you don’t have a basket or strainer, remove them from the boiling water with a slotted spoon.

, As soon as you remove the onions from the boiling water, place them in a bowl of ice or cold water. Let the onions sit in the cold water for the same amount of time that you boiled them to stop the cooking process.The ice or cold water that you place the onions in after boiling shouldn’t be more than 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius).
While the onions are in the cold water, stir them several times to ensure that they’re cooling evenly.

, When the onions have cooled long enough, drain them thoroughly in a colander. Shake well to remove the excess water, and blot with a clean towel. When they’re dry, transfer them to freezer bags and place them in the freezer.Be sure to label the freezer bag with the date so you can keep track of how long the onions are in your freezer.

Move the onion ice cubes to a plastic bag and leave them in the freezer.",How to Freeze Onions3," Use a knife to trim off the top and bottom of the onions so you can easily peel off the papery skin. Next, cut the onions into pieces to prepare them for pureeing. You don’t need to chop or dice the onion, but cut it into chunks that are small enough to fit in the blender.Use the pitcher from your blender as a guide for how small you should cut your onion. If it’s not very large, you should cut the onion into small pieces. In a large pitcher, cutting it into eighths may be sufficient.

, When you’ve cut all the onions into pieces, place them in a blender. Use the puree setting, and hold down on the button until the onions are ground into a thick but smooth puree.If you’re freezing a large number of onions, you’ll probably need to puree them in batches. Overfilling the blender’s pitcher makes it more difficult for the appliance to puree effectively.
If your blender’s motor isn’t very strong, you may need to push down on the onions as you’re pureeing to bring them into contact with the blades. To do so, set the handle of a metal ladle through the opening in the blender’s lid before placing it on the pitcher. The rounded end of the ladle should be inside the pitcher, so when you start pureeing, you can press down on the onions with the ladle. Because the bottom is rounded it won’t get caught in the blades., Once you’ve pureed the onions, use a spoon to carefully pour the puree into a clean ice cube tray. Place the tray in the freezer, and allow the puree to fully freeze, which should take approximately four hours.Be sure to cover the ice cube tray with a sheet of plastic wrap to prevent the onion smell from reaching the other food in the freezer.

, After the pureed onion ice cubes have frozen fully, carefully remove them from the tray. Place them in a plastic freezer bag, and store them in the freezer until you’re ready to use them.Remember to label the bag with the date that you’re freezing the onions, so you can be sure to use them within 6 months.

Any eggplant you freeze should be ripe and the seeds should not yet be fully mature. Look for eggplants that have a uniformly dark hue.
Do not use eggplants that have soft spots or mismatched patches of color.
Traditional black varieties tend to break down less in the freezer than purple Chinese and Thai varieties, but all types can technically be frozen for later use. Just be aware of the fact that the flesh will become softer after being frozen, but this is not usually an issue if you plan on cooking the eggplant after thawing it.
If you are unable to freeze the eggplant immediately, store it in the refrigerator until you are ready. The sooner you can freeze an eggplant after harvesting it, though, the better.;
, Rinse the eggplant under cold running water, scrubbing it gently with your fingers to remove dirt and residue.









If you harvested the eggplant from your own garden and have a hard time removing the dirt, you may scrub it gently with a vegetable brush.

, The eggplant should be separated into 1/3-inch (8.5-mm) thick skinless slices.









Use a sharp knife to cut off 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) from the top and bottom of the eggplant.
Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin. Stand the eggplant on one of its newly cut flat ends and peel the vegetable from top to bottom.
Use a sharp knife to cut the remaining eggplant into slices that measure about 1/3-inch (8.5-mm) each.
Work quickly, and only cut as much eggplant as you are able to blanch at a time. Cut eggplant will begin to discolor after 30 minutes.

, Roughly 2/3 of the pot should be filled with water. Set it to boiling on the stove over high heat.









Give the water ample time to reach a rolling boil.
Make sure that your pot is large enough to fit all the eggplant you've already cut up. You can blanch the eggplant in batches if you do not have any stockpots large enough to fit all your eggplants, but you should only cut up as much eggplant at a time as you can blanch in one batch.

, Pour 1








The lemon juice prevents the eggplant from discoloring and does not dramatically affect the taste of the eggplant.

, The bowl of water should be about as large as the stockpot used to blanch the eggplants.









Use a tray or more of ice to make sure that the water is plenty cold.
Make sure that the cold water is ready before you begin blanching the eggplant.

, Place the eggplant slices in the boiling water and blanch them for 4 minutes.









Blanching destroys enzymes in the eggplant that cause the vegetable to break down over time. If you do not blanch the eggplant, it will begin losing nutritional value, color, and flavor within a month, even if you freeze it.
You can safely use the same water to blanch multiple batches of eggplant up to five times. You may need to add more water and lemon juice as the water level dips, however.

, As soon as the eggplant has been blanched, use a slotted spoon to remove the slices from the boiling water and dunk them into the ice water.









By rapidly cooling the eggplant, you stop the cooking process.
Allow the eggplant slices to sit in the ice water 4 to 5 minutes or until cold to the touch.
Add more ice and water to the bowl as necessary to maintain the right temperature.

, Remove them from the ice water with a slotted spoon and drain them in a colander or on several layers of clean paper towels.








, You can either use a freezer-safe plastic resealable bag or a freezer-safe plastic container.









If packing the eggplant in freezer-safe plastic bags, remove as much air as possible from the bag to prevent freezer burn. Vacuum sealed bags are the best option, but you can still use standard resealable plastic bags as long as they are approved for freezer use.
If packing the eggplant in freezer-safe plastic containers, leave at least 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) empty headspace at the top of the container. This extra space allows the eggplant room to expand as it freezes.
Glass containers are not recommended for freezer use.
Label the bag or container with the current date so that you will know, in the future, how long your batch of eggplant has been sitting in the freezer.

,









This step is only optional, but if you do not take this precaution, the slices will stick together upon freezing.

, Typically, frozen eggplant stays good for about 9 months.









Vacuum-sealed eggplant that is deep frozen will will retain its quality for about 14 months.

, Another way to freeze eggplant is in pre-cooked form.








Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius). Prepare a shallow baking sheet by covering it with aluminum foil.
Use a fork to prick the eggplant multiple times. Pricking the eggplant prevents pressure from building up inside of it as it bakes. The more holes you create, the safer it will be.
Roast the eggplant 30 to 60 minutes. The eggplant is ready once it begins to collapse inside the oven. Smaller eggplants will only take 30 minutes, but larger ones may take up to an hour.
Scoop out the flesh. When the eggplant is cool to the touch, cut it open lengthwise using a knife. Use a metal spoon to dig out the flesh.
Pack the flesh into airtight containers. Leave 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) headspace in each container.
Freeze up to 12 months.

, If you plan on using the eggplant for eggplant parmesan, you can coat the eggplant slices in breadcrumbs and freeze without baking it.









Wash and slice the eggplant as you would if freezing plain, blanched slices.
Dip each slice in milk, beaten egg, or frying batter.
Coat the slices in a mixture of seasoned bread crumbs. The bread crumbs can be seasoned with Italian herbs, Parmesan cheese, or left as plain, dry bread crumbs.
Wrap the slices in wax paper. Instead of merely layering the slices between pieces of plastic wrap, make sure that each breaded slice is completely wrapped in its own sheet of wax paper.
Freeze up to 6 months.
To use, thaw the slices in the refrigerator and bake or fry them as you usually would.

Pre-freeze the carrots.Place the baking sheet of carrots in the freezer for 1 or 2 hours, or until the carrots are frozen solid.,
Transfer the carrots to a freezer-safe container.,
Freeze until ready to use.",How to Freeze Carrots," Choose fresh carrots that are young, tender, and free from any blemishes.









Medium-length carrots generally work best. True ""baby"" carrots are a small variety of carrot and do not retain their flavor as well during the freezing process, but technically, they can be used, too.
If possible, select carrots that were freshly harvested. If you cannot freeze the carrots immediately after they were harvested, you should refrigerate them until you can freeze them.
Do not use carrots that are limp or dried out.;
, Rinse or scrub the carrots under running water to remove dirt.









If using carrots harvested from your own garden, you will likely need to scrub them with a vegetable brush to remove the dirt.
If using store-bought carrots, rinsing them under cold to lukewarm water will usually be enough to clean them.

, Use a knife to cut the carrots into 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) coins.









Use a vegetable peeler to shave off the outer layer, revealing the bright orange flesh beneath.
Trim off the ends. Use a knife to cut 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) or so off both ends. Discard.
Cut the remainder of the carrot into 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) coins. You could also cut the carrots into thin, Julianne-style strips or other small pieces, but coins are generally the easiest to work with.
If you do decide to use baby carrots, you do not need to cut them up.

, Fill roughly 2/3 of the pot with water and set it to boiling over high heat.









The water needs to reach a strong, rolling boil.
If you do not have a pot that is large enough to hold all the chopped carrots, work in batches. Finish the blanching process for each batch before beginning the next batch.

, The bowl of ice water should be at least the same size as the pot of boiling water. Add a minimum of one tray of ice, roughly 12 cubes, to the bowl and fill 2/3 of it with cold water.

It is important that you have the ice water ready before you begin the process of blanching your carrots.
If working in batches, you may need to add more ice over time if you notice the first round of ice beginning to melt.

, Transfer the prepared carrots to the boiling water and cook them briefly.









Sliced carrots should only take 2 minutes. Whole baby carrots will take about 5 minutes.Blanching restricts certain natural enzymes and bacteria in the carrots, thereby preventing them from changing color, losing flavor, or losing nutritional value.
You can safely reuse blanching water up to five separate times, but you may need to add more hot water to the pot as time passes.

, As soon as the required amount of time passes, use a slotted spoon the scoop the carrots out of the pot and into the bowl of ice water.









Allow the carrots to sit in the ice water for the same amount of time they sat in the boiling water. Generally, this means that sliced carrots need to be cooled for 2 minutes and baby carrots need to be cooled for 5 minutes.
Cooling the carrots down is essential because it stops the cooking process. You do not want the carrots to be thoroughly cooked.

, Transfer the carrots to a colander and allow them to drain for several minutes.









Alternatively, you could also remove them from the water with a slotted spoon and sit them out to dry on layers of clean paper towel.

, Position the carrots on the baking sheet in a single layer, making sure that they do not touch one another or overlap.









If the carrots overlap at all, they will end up sticking together upon being frozen. This step is done for the sole purpose of preventing the carrots from sticking together in the freezer, making them easier to measure out and thaw later on.
If you do not have enough room on the baking sheet for all the carrots, use multiple baking sheets or do this step in batches.

,









Pre-freezing the carrots is an optional step. If you plan on using an entire bag or container of frozen carrots at once, you do not necessarily need to freeze the carrots individually. If you do not plan on using the entire batch at once, though, pre-freezing the carrots prevents them from sticking together when frozen for long-term storage.
The carrots are frozen solid once you cannot cut or break them with a knife.

, Slide the carrots off the baking sheet with a flat spatula and transfer them into a freezer-safe plastic container or freezer-safe resealable plastic bag.









If using a plastic container, make sure that there is at least 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace between the carrots and the top of the container.Food expands as it is frozen, and the extra space allows the carrots to expand as needed.
If using a plastic bag, make sure to squeeze out as much excess air as possible before sealing the bag. Use a vacuum sealer if you have one.
Glass containers are not recommended because they tend to crack and break in the freezer.
Label the container with the current date so that you will know, in the future, how long your carrots have been in storage.

, Carrots retain their quality for roughly 9 months in and ordinary freezer and an ordinary resealable plastic bag or plastic container.








If using a vacuum-sealed bag and storing the carrots in a deep freeze, carrots will usually last for 14 months without decreasing in quality.
Frozen carrots are best used in cooked dishes rather than raw dishes.

Choose a fresh, unblemished piece of ginger (or more pieces, as required).,
Wrap the ginger piece or pieces in plastic kitchen wrap or foil.,
Place the piece or pieces inside a resealable freezer bag.,
Place in the freezer.",How to Freeze Ginger1," Check that it is clean; if not, give it a gentle wipe and make sure it is dry before proceeding.;
, Wrap each piece separately if freezing more than one piece.

, Try to match the bag size to the size or amount of ginger being frozen. Push down to expel as much air as possible before sealing tight.

, Remove a whole ginger for use at a time. Allow to thaw, then use as usual.


If making a stir-fry and you have a decent sharp knife, slices can be made before the ginger thaws; it will thaw quickly during the cooking process.

Gather your supplies.,
Wash and trim the kale.,
Prepare your water.,
Boil the stems.,
Blanch the leaves.,
Shock the leaves.,
Drain and dry the leaves.",How to Freeze Kale1," To freeze kale, you first need to clean it, trim it, blanch it, and shock it to help preserve the flavor while it’s frozen. To do this, you'll need as much kale as you plan to freeze, along with a few simple kitchen tools, including:


Knife
Large pot
Large bowl
Colander or strainer
Four clean kitchen towels
Tongs
Slotted spoon;
, Rinse the kale leaves under running water to remove dirt, bugs, and other debris.Place the leaves on a clean towel to remove excess water. Cut the very ends off the stems, and then cut the stems into one-inch (2.5-cm) pieces. Set the stems aside. You can either leave the leaves whole, cut them into strips, or cut them in half for storage.


Kale stems are nutritious, but they can make the kale tough. You can remove them before freezing if you wish.
To remove the stem, cut off the bottom stem where there is no leaf, and then peel the leaves away from the center vein running up the middle of the kale.
Cleaning your kale before you freeze it will make it more convenient when you need it.

, Blanching is a two-part process that involves boiling the kale for a few minutes and then plunging it immediately into an ice bath. To prepare your water for the process:Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat.
Fill a large bowl with equal parts ice and cold water.
Have a colander or strainer nearby so you can drain the water from the leaves.

, When the water is boiling, add the pieces of kale stem and boil them for three minutes. Because the stems are thicker and tougher, they require a longer cooking time than the leaves.Cooking the stems separate from the leaves ensures that you don’t undercook the stems or overcook the leaves.
If you discarded the stems or used them for something else, go straight to blanching the leaves.

, Using tongs, place the kale leaves into the boiling water. Fill the pot as much as possible without overcrowding the leaves. Boil the greens for 2.5 minutes.Work in batches if you have more than a potful of kale. Make sure you allow the water to return to a boil before adding more leaves.
Blanching vegetables in this way kills enzymes and bacteria that can destroy the color, flavor, and nutrients of the vegetables. Killing these enzymes, therefore, allows you to store the kale longer., Use the slotted spoon to remove the kale from the boiling water. Plunge the kale immediately into the ice cold water to stop the cooking process. Leave the kale in the ice bath for 2.5 minutes, the same as your cooking time.If you're working in batches, add more ice after every batch of kale you chill.
Shocking the leaves in an ice bath will preserve the vibrant green color, and prevent the leaves from overcooking.

, Remove the leaves from the ice bath using the slotted spoon. Transfer the kale to the colander, and allow the excess water to drain off. Shake the colander regularly to help remove the water.Lay two clean kitchen towels on a flat work space. When most of the water has dripped off the kale, spread the leaves out on the towels.
Use the other two towels to dry the kale as much as possible.
Set the kale aside to finish air drying. The dryer the kale is when you freeze it, the fewer ice crystals will form, and the longer the kale will withstand freezer burn.
Drying the kale is important if you plan to freeze whole leaves, but not important if you're going to make kale puree to freeze.

Place back in the freezer.",How to Freeze Ginger2," Peel and mince finely. Use a fine grater or a food processor to mince the ginger.

,, Keep the layer as even as possible. Repeat until all of the minced ginger has been used up.

, Place the sheet or tray inside the freezer. Let freeze.

, Lift off the frozen portions of the minced ginger. Transfer each portion to either a resealable bag or an airtight container.


If using a bag, try to expel as much air as possible before resealing.

, Use as needed. This ginger will keep for up to six months."

Portion out the kale.,
Bag the kale.,
Label the bags.,
Transfer the bags to the freezer.",How to Freeze Kale2," You can do this according to personal preference or the types of recipes you plan on making. For instance, if you plan to use the kale for smoothies and only need a cup of kale for each one, portion the kale into one-cup (67 g) bunches.


At this point, you can also chop the kale into smaller pieces if you know that’s how you'll be using the leaves when you thaw them.

, Pack your portioned kale bunches tightly into sealable heavy-duty freezer bags. Press out as much air as possible, and then seal the bags most of the way. To remove the rest of the air, insert a straw into the opening and suck out the air. Then, remove the straw and quickly seal the bag the rest of the way.Air and moisture are two major contributors to freezer burn. Freezing dry kale and removing all the air from the bag will protect the kale from freezer burn.
You can also use a kitchen vacuum sealer if you have one, and this will do a great job of removing the air.

, With a marker, write on each bag the quantity of kale contained within and the date of freezing.This will help you keep track of how old the kale is, tell you when you need to use it by, and remind you what portion size is within each bag.


Labeling is important, because although you know right now how much kale is in each bag, you may forget in 10 months when you go to use it!

, Place the bagged and labeled kale into the freezer for storage. With the blanching, shocking, and proper storage, your kale should keep for up to 12 months.To use the kale, remove the needed portions from the freezer and use them immediately in recipes, or allow them to thaw for an hour before chopping.

Blend the kale.,
Pour into molds.,
Remove the puree from the cubes.",How to Freeze Kale3," Cut your kale into quarters and transfer a few handfuls to the blender. Measure out 1 cup (237 ml) of water and drizzle some over the kale. Turn on the blender and pulse a few times to break up the kale. Add a few more handfuls of kale and another drizzle of water. Repeat until you’ve pureed all the kale, using up to a cup of water if necessary.You can blend the kale raw or after you’ve blanched and scorched it, but make sure it’s clean.
Frozen kale puree is great for adding to soups, smoothies, and other dishes where you don’t want to notice the kale.
This method isn't suitable for salads, kale chips and other such dishes, because you won’t have access to whole kale leaves.

, To make the kale puree easier to use, distribute it evenly among ice cube trays, muffin pans, or mini muffin pans.Transfer the pans to the freezer and let the kale puree freeze, about three hours.


To freeze the kale puree in specific portion sizes, use a measuring cup to pour the kale into the mold.

, When the puree is frozen through, remove it from the ice cube trays or muffin tins and transfer it to a sealable plastic freezer bag. This will free up your ice cube trays, and make the puree easier to store.To prevent freezer burn, press out as much air as possible from the bag before sealing it.
Place the bag into the freezer to preserve the kale for up to a few months.

Wash your fruit.,
Cut up the fruit.,
Place your fruit on a baking sheet or wax paper on a plate.,
Transfer the fruit to a container.,
Learn how to defrost fruit here.

",How to Freeze Fruit," Use cold water to rinse your fruit of any dirt. Washing the fruit will keep you from consuming any pesticides that may be on the surface of the fruit. Pat your fruit dry with a paper towel., It is up to you as to whether or not you want to chop up smaller fruit like strawberries, but it generally recommended that you chop up larger fruit, as it will make it much easier to freeze. Cut your apples into slices, cube your melons, and quarter fruit like apricots.

, Make sure that your fruit is in one layer without any pieces overlapping. If they overlap while they freeze, your pieces might fuse together. Place the tray in the freezer., Once your fruit has frozen completely, you can take it off the baking sheet and move it to a freezer container.


You can also store frozen fruit in a resealable bag. Better yet, if you have a vacuum sealer, you can also use it to store your fruit. Vacuum sealers remove all air from your storage bag. If frozen food is exposed to the air, the food might develop a strange flavor.

Seal food destined for the freezer tightly.,
Let warm or hot, freshly cooked foods cool before freezing.,
Label and date every container and bag of frozen food.,
Store your food so that it freezes at a fast pace.",How to Freeze Food1," If the food is exposed to air in its container, plastic bag, or other packaging, it will cause the food to dry out and experience freezer burn.


Place your food in quality freezer bags or plastic containers; alternatively, wrap your food with freezer wrap or aluminum foil.
Squeeze any extra air out of the plastic bags and containers before sealing them.
Leave enough space for your food to expand in the bag or container if you are storing a liquid or a food that contains a lot of juice or gravy.
Be sure to label and date all frozen food.;
, This will prevent your food from retaining moisture during the freezing process if you place it into the freezer while it is still warm. Importantly, ensure that this food cools quickly; cool on the kitchen bench until the steam stops escaping. Then, place into the container and freeze.

, This will help you identify the foods after they have become frozen, and will also help you keep track of the dates on which they were originally placed in the freezer.


Place sticker labels on each container or use a permanent marker to label each plastic bag.

, The faster your food becomes frozen, the better it will retain its flavor and freshness upon defrosting it. This means avoiding freezing large amounts of food at a time; rather, split the food up.


Package your food in small portions so that it freezes faster, especially if you are freezing large dishes such as casseroles. This also means that it defrosts more quickly and it's easier to add packages together to make enough food than to undo a large package and leave waste.
Place your food in the freezer with space around each item. This will allow the cold air to circulate around your food efficiently and cause it to freeze at a fast pace.

Prevent the apples from browning.",How to Freeze Apples1," Rinse the apples under cold running water, scrubbing them gently with your fingers to remove surface dirt. Dry well.;
, Use a vegetable peeler or paring knife to remove the thin layer of skin surrounding the apple.


If you have it, you can also use a crank apple corer with a peeling attachment. These devices allow you to peel the apple as you core it, getting two steps done in one.







, Use a sharp knife to cut the apples into your desired slice-size.

Cut the apple into halves, and then into quarters.






Use a paring knife to cut away the core if you have not already cored the apple with an apple corer.






Cut the quarters in halves, thirds, or quarters. These will be the final slices you use to freeze the apples.







, Brush the apples with a mixture of 1/2 tsp (1500 mg) ascorbic acid and 3 Tbsp (45 ml) water.


You could also brush the apple slices with diluted lemon juice to accomplish the same purpose.

Find the ears that are just right.,
Husk the corn.,
Clean the corn.,
Boil a pot of water large enough to fit your cobs.,
Remove the corn from the water.,
Cut the corn off the cob.,
Chill the corn.,
Bag the corn.,
Freeze the bags.",How to Freeze Corn," Everybody's got their own definition of what's too big and too small to be tasty, but a good rule of thumb is to shake hands with the corn. If the cob fills your hand nicely and the silk on the top is brown, it's ready to pick. If it feels too scrawny, look for larger cobs to freeze.






;
, Have a seat and take all the husks off the corn once you've picked enough corn for your purposes. Collect the corn in a bowl and dispose of the husks.









For a classic country husking, sit outside in the afternoon sun and husk your corn.

, Rub the silky fibers off the cleaned cobs with your hands.It helps to keep a bowl of water on the table while working to dip your hands into, otherwise you end up feeling like Spiderman with everything you touch sticking to your hands.








, There are other methods of preparing and cooking the corn, but many believe this method gives the best taste. Put the corn in the water, put the lid on, and bring the water back to a rolling boil.








, You need to do this as quickly as possible to maintain the right texture of the corn. Take the corn out when the water's boiling and cool it down by submerging the corn in ice water.









If you have lots of corn to freeze, use one side of the sink to cool the hot ears just off the stove, then move the lukewarm ears to the left side of the sink to finish up the cooling. Cold water trickles in from the faucet into the left hand side of the sink.

, Once the corn has been blanched and cooled so that the ears are cool to the touch, use a sharp knife and run it down the cob vertically. Go slowly, and try to get enough corn without getting too much of the cob.








, Once the corn is off the cob, put it into cake pans or baking sheets for a good initial freezing. Cake pans work well because they spread out the corn and transfer the heat nicely. Freezing the corn on a flat surface is a good idea to freeze each kernel individually and ensure that you don't have a big, difficult to manage, block of starchy corn when you defrost it.









If you're freezing lots of corn, cycle the warmest batches from the cooler to the freezer to keep the temp of the freezer high. Don't put extremely hot corn straight into the freezer, or you'll lower the temperature and slow down the process considerably.You don't have to freeze them initially before bagging them, but it is a good idea to cool them down by doing this process at least for a little while.

, Once the pans of corn are completely cooled, all that's left is to package the corn up for final freezing. Use quart and pint Ziploc baggies and portion the corn into meal-sized amounts. Squeeze as much air as you can out of the bags before zipping them up.









Don't overfill the bags. You don't want them totally full, just enough so you can close them easily and then flatten them out so they store easily. A quart baggie is about enough for one meal for 4-5 people, and a pint baggie works well for 2 people.

, Stack them as flat as possible in your freezer. It's a good idea to date them and label the bags before putting them into the freezer for later. Frozen, sweet corn should be good for several months up to the next year.

Make sure the apple slices are in a single layer and are not touching one another. The benefit of this method is the apple slices are frozen individually, making it easy to use as much or as little at a time as needed. If the apples overlap or touch during this initial freezing, however, they will be stuck together until you thaw them, thereby removing this benefit.







, After the slices are frozen solid, remove them from the cookie sheet using a flat spatula and transfer them to a freezer-safe plastic container.


Alternatively, you could also use freezer-safe resealable plastic bags. Just make sure to press out as much air from the bag as possible when sealing it.

Measure out some duct tape.,
Make a duct tape handle on the lid.,
Pull the handle.",How to Open a Pickle Jar3," Find a roll of duct tape and pull out a long section. The section should be long enough to wrap halfway around the lid with about seven inches of extra tape. When in doubt, it’s better to measure out too much than too little.


You can buy duct tape at most grocery stores and hardware supply stores.

, Wrap the sticky side of the duct tape around the sides and top of the lid in a counter-clockwise direction. Wrap the duct tape halfway around the lid, letting the extra duct tape hang free. Press the sticky parts of the extra duct tape together to create an easy-to-grab duct tape handle.If your jar has a lot of condensation on it, wipe the jar dry before applying the duct tape.

, Grip the jar firmly in your non-dominant hand. Use your dominant hand to pull on the handle. The force of your pull should twist the jar lid in a counter-clockwise direction. Keep pulling until the lid pops off.

Make sure the water isn’t boiling hot! You should be able to touch the water safely. Otherwise, you may crack the glass of the jar.

, Hold the jar under the stream of hot water, focusing on the lid. If you’re using a bowl of hot water, set the jar upside-down in the bowl so that the lid is completely submerged. Allow the jar to heat up for a few moments. The heat from the water will expand the metal of the lid and help separate it from the jar.Rotate the jar while running it under hot water to help distribute the heat.

, Hold the jar steady with your non-dominant hand. If the lid is too hot to comfortably touch, cover it with a dish towel to protect your hand. Using your dominant hand, grasp the lid firmly and twist in a counter-clockwise direction.


If the lid is still stuck, cover it with a rubber glove or a dish towel before trying again. This will help pry the lid loose by adding friction.

Choose a healthy, crunchy option if you prefer a crunchy snack.,
Use your 'healthiest judgement' when choosing treats.,
Find a package of 100-calorie snacks if you don't know what you'd like.,
Ask around.",How to Make Healthy Choices when Buying from a Vending Machine," Do you want something sweet? Salty? Crunchy? This is important, because you're ensuring that you'll be happy with what you get.;
, Try something like beef jerky or a bag of nuts (any kind). These options are pretty caloric, but nuts are fatty (the good way), and the protein that they're filled with will make you not be hungry for a while. Beef jerky is another healthy choice with a lot of protein. The only thing to watch is that both of these snacks have are filled with salt.

, Try something like a bag of pretzels; they don't have many calories, nor are they very fatty. The only thing to be aware of, though, is, because they are filled with carbohydrates, that they can make you hungry a little later after you eat them. Alternatively, you could get some popcorn that's not heavy, or cheese crackers.


Skip the potato chips; they're not very healthy. But, if you are absolutely dying for potato chips, get the baked kind rather than the fried kind.

, Find something like a bag of cookies that don't have much fat, candies that taste like fruit, snacks of fruit, or licorice. Refrain from selecting little chocolate doughnuts, as they're high in calories, and have about 40 grams of sugar.


Look for the healthiest candy bar choice if you prefer a candy bar. Try the Payday bar, one of the healthiest choices because it's filled with nuts. If your vending machine doesn't provide a Payday bar, try a nutritional protein or energy bar in alternative. These types of bars are lightly nutritional.

, This is a healthy option, and you won't be taking in many calories.

, Sometimes, you run out of options. Find the person who works at and puts snacks in it to think about furnishing other healthy options for you to order.

Dissolve salt in a bowl of water.,
Soak the apple slices in the salt water.,
Drain the apples.,
Transfer the apple slices to plastic freezer bags.,
Freeze the apple slices.",How to Freeze Apples3," Fill a large bowl with cold water and add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of salt per 1 gallon (4 liters) of water. Stir until the salt is completely dissolved.


The salt acts as a preservative, prolonging the amount of time you can store the apple slices without them going bad or getting freezer burn.

, Add the apples to the salt water and let them soak for a few minutes.

Depending on how many apple slices you have, you may need to do this in batches.






Make sure the apple slices are submerged under the water. If they will not stay beneath the surface, gently press them beneath the water using a spatula so all sides are exposed to the salt water.







, Pour the contents of the bowl through a colander to drain the apples.


If you still need to use the salt water for additional batches, drain the apple slices by removing them with a slotted spoon.






Do not rinse the apples.

, Spread the slices out as much as possible to prevent them from sticking together while they freeze.


Squeeze out as much excess air as possible as you seal the bag.






You could also use a freezer-safe plastic food container, but be aware the apple slices will likely freeze together into a solid mass if piled on top of one another.







, The slices can stay fresh for 6 to 12 months when frozen using this method.


Try to keep the bag as flat as possible during this time to prevent the apples from freezing together.
Apples frozen using this method are especially suitable for pies, baked apples, and other sweetened, baked apple dishes.

Create a syrup mixture.,
Add the apples to the syrup.,
Pack the apples into freezer bags.,
Freeze.",How to Freeze Apples4," Mix 2 cups (450 ml) of sugar with 3 cups (750 ml) of cold water in a large bowl until the sugar is dissolved.If desired, you can also add 1/2 tsp (1500 mg) ascorbic acid to the syrup to help prevent the apples from browning.

, Transfer the apple slices to the bowl of syrup and mix with a spatula or large spoon until the slices are thoroughly and evenly coated.


You could also coat the apples by pouring the syrup and the slices into a large plastic bag and turning the bag multiple times to coat the apples.







, Use a slotted spoon to transfer the apple slices from the bowl of syrup to a resealable, freezer-safe plastic bag.


Squeeze out excess air from the bag as you seal it.






Do not worry about draining off the excess syrup. You do not want large globs of syrup in the bag, but some syrup is necessary to help preserve the apples.
If desired, you can also use a freezer-safe plastic container instead of a bag.







, When kept this way, frozen apples can retain their quality for 6 to 12 months.


Syrup-packed apples are best used for uncooked desserts and fruit cocktails.

Wash the apple.,
Remove the core.,
Dunk the apple in ascorbic acid.,
Wrap the apple in plastic wrap.Bring the plastic wrap around all sides of the apple, twisting it at the top and securing the twist with a metal clip.,
Freeze.",How to Freeze Apples5," Rinse the apple under running water, scrubbing the skin gently with your fingers to remove any dirt.


Dry thoroughly with clean paper towels.






Do not cut the apples into slices as you would with other methods.

, Place a hand-held apple corer over center of the apple and press down firmly. The corer should pierce through the apple, completely separating the core. Pull the corer and the core out.

If you do not have an apple corer, use a long paring knife to cut a hole all the way through the thickness of the apple and around the core.






More elaborate apple corers remove the skin and the core. This can be especially useful if you plan on needing to remove the peel when you use the apple later.






To save time, skip this step. Coring the apple is only optional, but it is recommended. Processing the apple after taking it out of the freezer can be difficult. By removing the core beforehand, you have at least performed the most basic form of processing.

, Mix 1/2 tsp (1500 mg) into 3 Tbsp (45 ml) of water. Pour this mixture through the cored-out center and along any peeled sides to prevent browning.

Alternatively, you could also soak the apples in a small amount of lemon juice or use a mixture made from 1/2 tsp (1500 mg) Vitamin C and 1 quart (1 liter) cold water.







,

Alternatively, place the apple in a resealable plastic bag. Place the apple inside the bag and seal it tightly, pressing out as much excess air as possible.







, A whole apple can last approximately 6 months in the freezer without going bad or getting much freezer burn.


It is best to use frozen whole apples for culinary uses that require whole apples, like apple dumplings, baked whole apples, or slow cooked whole apples.

Wrap the celery tightly in aluminum foil.,
Re-wrap your celery after each use.,
Keep the celery for three to four weeks.",How to Keep Celery Crisp1," Celery often goes bad fast because it releases ethylene, a ripening hormone. When wrapped in foil, foil allow the ethylene to escape. If celery is stored in a loose plastic bag, ethylene is trapped, which will cause the celery to get limp. Aluminum foil prevents celery from becoming overripe and losing crispness.Ethylene is a hormone plants give off naturally. It's an aging and ripening hormone, which causes plants to ripen and then decompose. While ethylene is necessary to get plants ripe, it can cause decay and overripe plants after a certain point.Storing celery in a plastic bag traps ethylene, causing celery to go bad quicker.;
, After using celery for a meal, be sure to re-wrap it in aluminum foil. Remember to wrap the celery tightly, as this will allow the ethylene to escape.If your aluminum foil is getting dirty, replace the wrapping with a new piece.

, Store the celery in your refrigerator. Using this method, you can expect your celery to keep for three to four weeks. After this, it will begin to go bad and should be thrown out.It can help to write the date you originally stored the celery down on the aluminum foil.
Celery should not be eaten after it spoils. Celery that has gone bad will have a whitish color. It will also hollow out in the middle. The stalks will begin to bend away from the stem."

Check the recycling symbol on the bottom of the bucket.,
Examine any food-handling symbols imprinted on the plastic bucket.,
Consult the label on the plastic buckets.,
Utilize buckets that have previously been used to store food.",How to Identify Food Grade Buckets," The quickest and most reliable way to check for food safety is by consulting the recycling number. This number will be between 1 and 7 and will be stamped inside a triangle of arrows. As a general rule, the numbers that are safe for use with food are 1, 2, 4, and 5.


The best type of plastic for use in long-term food storage is high-density polyethylene (HDPE), which is indicated by the ""2"" symbol. HDPE is one of the most stable and inert forms of plastic, and all plastic buckets sold specifically for food storage will be made from this material.
Other types of plastic acceptable for food storage include PETE, LDPE, and polypropylene (PP). These plastics are represented by the numbers 1, 4, and 5 respectively.
An exception to this rule is bio-plastics, which are categorized under the catch-all symbol ""7."" Bio-plastics are plastic-like materials that are synthesized from plant-based sources such as corn. These materials are nonreactive and can be used to store food, but note that not all plastics marked as ""7"" are bio-plastics.;
, A standardized system of symbols is used on plastics to indicate their appropriate uses around food. A symbol depicting a cup and fork means that the plastic is safe for storing food, and is therefore a food grade bucket. Other symbols include radiating waves meaning ""microwave-safe,"" a snowflake meaning ""freezer-safe,"" and dishes in water meaning ""dishwasher-safe.""

, If the buckets still have a price tag, manufacturer's label, or other identifying tag on them, you can consult this tag to determine if the plastic is food grade. Food grade buckets will nearly always be marked as such, because they are often more expensive to produce and thus can be sold at a premium. If the tag is missing, you may be able to contact the manufacturer and ask about the buckets they produce to determine if yours is food grade.

, If a plastic bucket was initially designed for food storage, then it is a good bet that it is suitable for storing your own bulk foods.


For example, many bakeries receive frosting and other ingredients in large plastic buckets, often of 5 gallon (19 L) capacity. These bakeries may be willing to donate or sell their empty buckets to you, after which you can clean them and use them for food storage.
Smaller plastic containers should be exempted from this rule. For example, bottled water is often packaged using PETE (with the designation ""1""), which is designed to be used once and then recycled. PETE is initially food safe, but may break down and release harmful compounds if continually reused.

Plan your meals.,
Make a list.,
Change up your food gradually.,
Eat before you go.,
Learn your store.,
Avoid the processed foods.,
Read labels.,
Look for special labels.,
Load up on produce.,
Pick whole grains.,
Choose low-fat dairy over high-fat.,
Focus on lean proteins.,
Pick healthier staples.",How to Make Healthier Choices at the Grocery Store," Healthier choices at the grocery store start before you get there. You first need to make a healthy plan for your meals. Pick recipes that include lean proteins (think fish, skinless chicken, and beans), whole grains, low-fat dairy, fruits, and vegetables. Once you know what meals you want to make it, you'll find the grocery store much easier to navigate.If meal planning isn't your forte, try using a meal-planning app, which will do a lot of the work for you.Plan for some quick meals on those nights when you can't manage something elaborate. For example, you could choose something easy, like a fresh salad, or you could make more one night so you have leftovers the next night.If you have children, include them in the meal planning process. This will ensure that you pick healthy foods that your children will eat. Your children may also enjoy helping out in the kitchen as you cook these meals.;
, You've got your meals planned out. Now, you need to make a list. A list is important because if you don't make a list, you're more likely to take detours into less healthy sections of the grocery store. Once you've got a list, try to stick to it.Include healthy snacks on your list. It's unreasonable to think you won't want any snacks, and if you leave it to when you're in the grocery store (or worse, standing in front of a vending machine), you're not likely to make healthy choices. Pick things like frozen yogurt, air-popped popcorn, whole grain crackers, low-fat cheese, fruits, vegetables, and hummus.Many meal-planning apps will also create a grocery list for you. You can also get apps exclusively to help you create grocery lists.

, If you haven't been making healthy choices, you don't want to suddenly switch your whole diet. That's likely to lead to you crashing and burning, and then you'll go back to your less healthy choices. Instead, make changes slowly, trying to make a single healthier choice each week.For example, try a no-sugar added canned fruit instead of one in syrup, or try picking whole-wheat bread instead of white bread.

, Shopping while hungry may encourage impulse buying. You may even find yourself buying unhealthy snacks instead of sticking to your shopping list. Try to avoid shopping while hungry. If you can, eat a healthy snack or meal before you go to the store to reduce the temptation., Each store is set up a bit differently, but often the healthiest options (the ingredients rather than whole meals) are on the perimeter. For instance, produce, dairy, meat, bread, and frozen foods are often on the perimeter. You may want to make some forays into other sections, such as the canned vegetable aisle, but try to skip aisles where you make less healthy choices, such as the frozen pizza aisle., While some processed foods are healthier than others, its best to cook foods at home if you can. Shop for ingredients, like whole wheat pasta, tomato sauce, and lean ground chicken, instead of whole meals, like a frozen spaghetti dinner. What you make at home will likely have less fat, less sugar, and fewer preservatives., Another key to making healthy choices at the grocery store is to look closely at labels. Pay particular attention to saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium. For each serving, look at the daily value: twenty percent (or more) of your daily value is high, while five percent or less is low. Try to keep these items on the low end.On the other hand, try to increase your intake of vitamins and fiber.
After reading the labels, try to pick the healthiest option of what's available., Special labels can help you identify healthy foods. For instance, the American Heart Association has a special label (look for a red check) to mark heart-healthy foods. You can also look for words like ""low-sodium"" or ""low-fat"" to help you choose. However, keep in mind that just because it says something like ""low-fat,"" that doesn't mean it's healthy. Sometimes, manufacturers will increase sugar to make up for the fat, so always read the label closely., Fruits and vegetables are one of the healthiest options in the grocery store, so feel free to stock up. Fresh can be delicious, but canned and frozen can be just as good for you. When picking canned or frozen, be sure to skip brands with added sugars or sodium.Don't be afraid to try out new fruits and vegetables. You may find something new that you love. If the fruit or vegetable is completely new to you, look up a recipe so you know how to use it best., Whole grains are generally healthier for you than more processed options. When picking out items such as bread, pasta, or cereal, look for words like ""100 percent whole wheat"" or ""100 percent whole grain."" The higher the percentage, the better. At least half of your grains should be whole grains.You can also cook whole grains by themselves, such as oatmeal, bulgur, quinoa, and buckwheat.

, When shopping in the dairy section, look for low-fat options. For instance, choose skim or one percent milk over whole. Try plain, non-fat yogurt instead of full-fat. Pick up low-fat mozzarella instead of full-fat. Making these simple switches will help keep the fats in your diet down, and often, you won't even notice the change in many recipes., Lean proteins, like chicken, fish, and beans are a great choice if you're looking to eat healthier. Boneless, skinless chicken breast, for instance, is a very healthy choice. Fish is also a great addition, particularly fish high in omega-3 fatty acids like salmon and tuna. Beans are very lean, and they are a great source of fiber and protein.If you're on a budget, try canned salmon or tuna. Also, beans are very budget-friendly, particularly dried beans.

, When shopping for items you eat all the time, like cereals, dressings, yogurts, and even desserts, always look for the healthiest option. Try low-fat varieties or ones with less sugar to make them healthier. You may even find you like these versions better."

Draw a large pyramid on a piece of paper.,
Label each section of the pyramid.,
Mark the number of servings for each section.",How to Make a Food Pyramid1," The symbolic meaning of the pyramid – wide base that narrows to a point at the top – parallels the amount of each food group you should include in your daily diet. Although the modern version of the pyramid takes into account physical activity, age, and gender, the original concept design was to illustrate that a variety of foods need to be consumed in differing amounts to maintain a healthy diet. Divide the paragraph into four sections by drawing three horizontal lines across the pyramid.
The base, or bottom level, should run the entire width of the pyramid. The next two levels should be split down the middle by drawing a vertical line in the center of each level. The top level, or peak, should be its own level.
Since there are a great variety of foods that you consume during the week, make sure the pyramid is large enough to enter multiple food names within the structure of the pyramid.;
, The food pyramid emphasizes five major food categories along with fats, oils, and sweets. It is important to accurately label each section of the pyramid because each food category provides some, but not all, of the nutrients you will need throughout the week. The bottom and largest level is reserved for breads, cereals, rice, and pasta. These are all foods made from grains, which requires the greatest nutritional intake per day.
The second level from the base is divided into two sections – vegetables on the left and fruits on the right. All of these foods are made from plants, which contain the essential vitamins, minerals, fibers needed on a daily basis.
The third level from the base contain products made from animals – milk, yogurt, and cheese; and meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts. These foods are high in protein, calcium, iron, and zinc. The left side should be labeled the vegetable group and the right as meat group.
The peak of the pyramid is not a food group; rather, this is where the fats, oils, and sweets section goes.

, Section size and pictures give you a visual idea of how much of each group should be consumed, but placing the number of servings is a more accurate representation. Serving size is a good way to evaluate how much you are eating because the labels on packages at the grocery store are required to reveal the number of servings of all foods that you buy. The number of servings depends on how many calories you need to consume for a healthy diet. For example, 1,600 calories is enough for older adults and sedentary women; 2,200 calories is sufficient for children, teenage girls, active women, and sedentary men; and 2,800 calories is suitable for teenage boys, active men, and very active women.
These three calorie levels are labeled as lower, moderate, and higher, which accounts for the range of suggested serving size. You must decide which level you fit best under.
On the pyramid, label the grain group 6-11 servings; the vegetable group 3-5 servings; the fruit group 2-4 servings; both the milk and meat groups are 2-3 servings each; and the fats, oils, and sweets should be labeled as “use sparingly.”

Shop frequently instead of stocking up.,
Examine all produce for bruises, nicks and decay.,
Prepare daily meals based on the individual spoilage factors of each item.,
Store produce in their most accommodating environments.,
Utilize plastic bags to maintain humidity when storing certain items, such as zucchini, cabbage and leafy greens.,
Keep mushrooms in a paper bag.,
Move berries out of their containers and into plastic containers with lids.,
Use the crisper bins in your refrigerator for fragile produce storage.,Cut the ends off asparagus and celery and stand upright in a container with an inch of water.,
Keep onions and potatoes in a cool, dark place outside of the refrigerator.,
Separate avocados, bananas and tomatoes away from other vegetables.",How to Keep Produce Fresh," The more often you buy produce throughout the week, the better chance you have of purchasing fresh stock.;
, Damaged produce will rapidly decay because once broken leaves and skin are exposed to air, spoilage will occur. If produce in your refrigerator is damaged, consume it sooner than undamaged items.

, Fragile produce such as lettuce should be eaten sooner than heartier items like potatoes.

, Some produce should not be refrigerated until ripened, like nectarines. Other produce needs a climate controlled storage environment as quickly as possible, such as carrots, which should go into the bin as soon as you bring it home from the store.

, Punch several holes in the plastic bags to allow them to breathe.

, Because mushrooms will spoil in humid conditions created by plastic bags, keeping them in a paper bag will absorb excess humidity and reduce spoilage.

, Berries are fragile and will quickly deteriorate when exposed to air. Storing them inside a sealed container will minimize produce spoilage due to excess handling and opening and closing of the refrigerator door., Ideally you'll have 2 climate controlled bins; a low humidity one for hard vegetables and fruit with low water content, and a high humidity one for salad greens, herbs and leafy greens like Swiss chard.

,, Do not store them together on the same shelf since onions will cause potatoes to sprout.

, These produce items emit ethylene, an invisible and odorless gas that causes rapid ripening. Store them on the counter top.

Let the nuts boil for one minute. After a minute, remove the saucepan from the heat and drain them in a colander.Rinse the nuts under cold water.;
, When the nuts are cool to the touch, pinch each nut gently between your fingers to peel off the skin. Discard the skin. Use a sharp knife to slice the nuts into slivers.

When all the nuts are peeled and sliced, set them aside., Pour the milk into a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Turn the heat to high and bring the milk to a boil. When the milk starts to boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and continue simmering. Stir every four minutes to push the layer of bubbles and film to the side of the pot and scrape the sides.

Continue simmering and stirring the milk for about 90 minutes, until the milk reduces by half and thickens., Stir the mixture to incorporate the sugar and nuts into the milk. Keep cooking the milk for another 15 to 20 minutes, until the sugar dissolves and the milk reduces to a third of the original quantity., When the milk is thick and sweet, add the cardamom and saffron to the mixture. Stir to incorporate the spices. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the rabri to cool for at least an hour. Transfer the mixture to the refrigerator to chill.

You can use nutmeg to flavor the milk instead of cardamom if you like.
You can also add a teaspoon (5 ml) of rose essence to the rabri if you want., Pour the flour, fennel seeds, cardamom, sugar, and whole milk powder into a medium mixing bowl. Reserve the baking soda for later. Whisk the ingredients together well to fully combine them.You can use three to four whole cardamom seeds in place of the ground cardamom. To use the whole seeds, chop them finely before adding them to the dry ingredients.
You can also use khoya in place of the whole milk powder. Khoya is a thick, dried milk product that you can find in Indian or Asian markets. Add the khoya with the wet ingredients instead of the dry.

, Pour the yogurt and the water into the bowl with the dry ingredients. If you're using khoya instead of milk powder, add the khoya now as well. Whisk all the ingredients together until it forms a thick, smooth batter.Unlike North American pancakes, you don’t want any lumps in the malpua batter.

, Once all the ingredients are combined and you have a smooth malpua batter, cover the bowl with a clean towel and set it aside for 30 minutes. Leave it on the counter or somewhere else at room temperature.Resting the batter will give the flour time to absorb liquid, and improve the final texture of the malpua.

, Pour the ghee into a large heavy bottomed frying pan or skillet. Turn the heat to medium and leave the ghee to preheat for three to four minutes. While it’s heating up, add the baking powder to the batter and whisk it in.


You can use any cooking oil in place of the ghee. Good oils for frying include canola and vegetable.

, Reduce the heat to medium-low. Pour 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of batter into the hot ghee. Spread the batter out with the back of a ladle or spoon. If there's room in the pan, add more batter to cook a second malpua. Cook the malpua for two to three minutes. Flip the malpua with a spatula and cook for another two to three minutes, until it’s golden brown on both sides.When the malpua is ready, remove it from the pan.
Add more ghee if necessary, and continue frying the malpua one or two at a time until all the batter is gone.

, Line a wire cooling rack with a clean lint-free towel or several sheets of paper towels. Use tongs or a spatula to transfer the malpua to the towel to absorb excess oil.Leave the malpua to drain for at least a minute before transferring it to the syrup.

, In a small bowl, combine the hot water and saffron threads. Let the saffron soak for at least five minutes, and as many as 20 if you have the time. This will give the saffron time to infuse the water with its subtle flavor., Combine the sugar and saffron water in a medium saucepan. Turn the heat to medium and bring the mixture to a simmer. Simmer the sugar and water mixture for about 10 minutes, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture has formed a thick syrup.


As the mixture is cooking, stir regularly as the sugar melts to avoid burning.

, When the syrup is thick and hot, whisk in the rose essence.Add the cardamom seeds and stir the mixture to distribute the seeds. Turn the heat to low.

Leave the syrup on the heat so it stays warm.

, Place as many cooked malpua into the syrup as you can fit. Make sure the malpua are completely covered by the syrup. You may have to soak them in batches. Soak the malpua in the syrup for about 10 minutes.After soaking, remove the malpua from the syrup with tongs. Transfer the malpua to a wire cooling rack with a plate underneath to catch excess syrup.
Transfer the next batch of cooked malpua to the syrup for soaking.

, When the soaked malpua are still hot, transfer them to individual plates for serving. Spoon some chilled rabri on top of each malpua, or place the rabri on the side for dipping. If you like, you can also garnish the malpua with chopped nuts, dried fruit, and other toppings."

, Fold the paper towel in half. Then, wrap the towel tightly and make sure to cover the full stalk. When the towel is fully wrapped, take a rubber band. Use this to secure the paper towel to the celery stalk., You can now place the celery back in the plastic bag it came in. However, you do not want ethylene to get trapped in the bag. Ethylene is a ripening hormone that can cause celery to go bad faster. Wrap the bag around the celery tightly, as this will allow the ethylene to be released. Then, use rubber bands to secure the bag in place., Watch for signs the celery has gone bad. You may notice the stalks bending away from the stem, the celery turning white, and the middle becoming hollow. Celery generally lasts anywhere from three to four weeks in the fridge."
"
Prepare the celery for storage.,

Throw away celery that's gone bad.",How to Keep Celery Crisp3," You will have to chop up the celery in order to store it in water. To start, cut the stalks off the base of the celery.You should also remove any leaves. If you want to use the celery leaves for cooking, store them elsewhere.
Once the leaves and stalks are removed, cut each piece of celery in half.

, Choose a container that can comfortably fit all the pieces of celery. It should also have enough room that you can have about an inch of headspace on top. A Tupperware container or a larger bowl would work well.A container you can easily seal works best. The less exposure celery gets to air, the better.

, Use filtered water, as tap water can expose your celery to chemicals. Pour enough water to cover the celery. Seal the container tightly and then place it in the fridge. If your container does not have a lid, seal it with plastic wrap., It's important to remember to change the water. This method will not work as well if celery sits in the same water each day.Remember to use filtered water over tap water.
This method can be used on other root vegetables to keep them crisp over time.

, Eventually, celery will go bad even with proper storage. It usually goes bad after three to four weeks.Bad celery will have a whitish color. It will also hollow out in the middle.

Select a variety of foods.,
Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and grains.,
Choose foods low in fat and cholesterol.,
Avoid large amounts of added sugar.,
Pass on salt and sodium.",How to Make a Food Pyramid2," There is no super food that contains all the necessary, protein, vitamins, minerals, and fibers needed for a healthy diet. Instead, food contains combinations of these requirements and, therefore, you need to diversify the food you eat from the five major food groups on the food pyramid. Because we often eat food that we enjoy and are familiar with preparing, it is difficult to diversify our diet. Try to moving away from eating the same or similar foods on a regular basis.
Think about balance: people often choose higher or lower amounts from some food groups more than other that is suggested in the food pyramid.
Food with beautiful colors – red, yellow, and green – usually found in fruits and vegetables, is very healthy. In other words, eat with your eyes.
If it is too difficult to make whole sale changes in your diet, consider changing out just one portion at a time or adding something different to each meal.
Most people love leftovers, but usually leftovers cannot be a meal in itself. Add vegetables or whole grain breads to your leftovers to make a more complete meal.

, There is a reason why these three categories are the largest spaces on the pyramid and contain the highest number of servings – because they are the healthiest. Eating plenty of these foods will make you feel full and leave less room for fat, sugar, and oils. Vegetables and fruits contain important vitamins A and C, folate, iron, and magnesium, and are low in fat and sodium.
Dark, leafy vegetables like broccoli, spinach, and romaine contain fiber and are known to prevent some cancers and restore damaged skin.
Deep, yellow vegetables such as carrots and sweet potatoes contain large amounts of antioxidants that protect against cardiovascular disease and cancer.
Choose from fresh fruit and fruit juices and either frozen, canned, or dried fruits to meet the required amount of servings. Avoid heavy syrups or added sugar products claiming to be fruit products.
Citrus fruits, melons, and berries are rich in vitamin C, packed with antioxidants, and are a delicious alternative for desert compared to sugary cakes and pies.

, The food pyramid focuses specifically on fat intake because research finds that the America diet is too high in fat. Therefore, the food pyramid is designed to lower the intake of fatty foods and cholesterol. Avoiding these two deadly ingredients will reduce your chances of getting heart disease, cancer, and help you maintain an ideal weight. Fat should never be more than thirty percent of your total calorie intake. Just by eating the healthy food listed on the food pyramid with the lowest fat content, you will consume fifty percent of total fat suggested by the USDA.
Try not to constantly check how many grams of fat you eat every day. Instead, check it once or twice a week just to make sure you are staying within the guidelines.
In particular, avoid saturated fats found in meat and dairy products because they could increase your risk for heart disease.
Although cholesterol is similarly found in meat and dairy products and causes increase risk of heart disease, they are not the same as saturated fats, but should also be avoided.

, Added sugars, not those that are naturally found in fruits, contain no nutritional value and, instead, make you fatter and more prone to diseases and cancers. Sugars include white, brown, and raw, as well as corn syrup, honey, and molasses.
Added sugars can be found in most of the foods we enjoy like ice cream, candy, soda, jams and jellies.
Try to limit added sugars to six teaspoons to a low calorie diet; twelve teaspoons to a moderate calorie diet; and 18 teaspoons to a high calorie diet to minimize potential damage.

, Salt in itself is not bad, the problem stems from added salt during cooking or seasoning food that already contains salt. In other words, be mindful of food labels since they reveal how much salt or sodium is already present in the food. An abundance of sodium in your body causes water retention, which places an extra burden on the heart and blood vessels causing high blood pressure. This could lead to more serious problems like a heart attack or stroke.
Instead of using table salt, substitute it with herbs, spices, vinegar, or citrus juice.
Try to purchase unsalted or low sodium foods.

Soak the spinach in cool water.,
Rinse well.,
Dry thoroughly.",How to Freeze Spinach1," Place fresh spinach leaves into a large bowl, then cover them with clean, cold water.


Use your hands to mix and sort through the spinach leaves as they soak. Sort through the leaves to remove damaged leaves, weeds, insects, stones, dirt, or other debris.

, Drain the soak water and transfer the spinach to a large colander. Rinse the spinach under cool, running water for about 30 seconds.


If you're thorough enough, the first soak and rinse will probably remove most debris. For spinach that seems especially dirty, or to be extra cautious, repeat both steps twice more to remove as much dirt as possible.

, Place the spinach into a salad spinner, then use the utensil to spin away as much water as possible.


If you do not have a salad spinner, you can wrap the leaves in paper towels and gently squeeze out the excess moisture. Afterward, spread the leaves out over a layer of fresh paper towels for 10 to 15 minutes to continue drying them.
Thorough drying is especially important if you plan on freezing raw, unblanched spinach. It's not too significant when freezing blanched or pureed spinach, though.

, In some cases you could pour lemon juice all over the produce and it won’t make any difference. Have a list of which fruits and vegetables will not turn brown with lemon:


Cut fruits include apples, pears, bananas and peaches.
Cut vegetables include cauliflower, potatoes, sweet potatoes, parsnips, and artichokes.

, Corrosion on the knife will accelerate browning effects so its in your best interest to select a cutting instrument that is not only extremely sharp but also 100% stainless steel.

, Before cutting fruit and vegetables, have your lemon base ready to go so all you will need to do is apply the citrus to the cut fruit immediately to stop the oxidation process.

, Cut first piece of fruit/vegetable and then either rub the surface with lemon or dip into saucer of lemon juice.


Avoid oversaturating the fruit or vegetable to avoid having it take on a strong lemon taste (unless that is your intention).

,


If you are planning to integrate the fruits and/or vegetable into a dish in the future, immerse in cold water until ready to use.

Do not store raspberries in the coldest part of your fridge.,
Do not place raspberries in the crisper.",How to Store Raspberries1," You should not store berries in an airtight container. To stay fresh, berries need some air circulation. Use the original container they came in, which usually has slots and holes. If don't have the original container, store them in something like a colander., Too much moisture can cause raspberries to become moldy. You should line the container you use with paper towels. This will absorb some moisture, keeping the raspberries fresh longer.Make sure to leave any holes near the container's lid uncovered. Remember, raspberries do require some air circulation to remain fresh.

, Many people feel keeping raspberries in a cold portion of the fridge will increase their shelf life. This is actually not true. Storing the raspberries in a colder part of the fridge can actually cause frost damage.Instead of placing the raspberries in a cold portion of your fridge, place them where you're likely to see them. You will eat raspberries quicker if they're easy to reach, preventing them from going bad.

, Raspberries will not stay fresher in a fruit or vegetable crisper. The air in the crisper may be slightly more humid than it is in the rest of the fridge. This can make your raspberries dry out quicker. It's better to keep the raspberries outside the crisper when storing them in the fridge."

Keep a food journal.,
Match journal entries to the food pyramid.,
Evaluate the size of your portions.",How to Make a Food Pyramid3," Every time you go grocery shopping or dine out, write down what you buy and what you eat. This way you can have a better idea of what sections on the pyramid you are fulfilling. Try doing this for a week to one month. Keep the journal with you to immediately record everything you eat and drink.
Try to be honest and accurate. Record the date and time when you are eating.
At the end of each day, examine what you have eaten and decide if you need to eat better.

, After compiling a record of the foods you ate, serving sizes, and the amount of fat, match it to the food pyramid that you made. Determine whether you are meeting the recommended amount of servings for each category. If not, consider what is preventing you from achieving your goals. Search for patterns in your food choices. It is not unusual to buy a box of cereal and have it every day until the box is empty. It might be, however, a better idea to buy two boxes or more to mix it up and maybe on the weekend, with more time, you can prepare something more elaborate like pancakes with fruit.
Be aware of how many snacks you routinely have. A cookie here, a brownie there, a scoop of ice cream after dinner really adds up and they are all in the category that suggests moderation or zero servings. These types of snacks leave you hungrier than if you eat a piece of fruit, which contains filling fiber and healthy sugars.
Do you eat healthier during the week while at work or on the weekend with more time on your hands? Time management has plenty of influence on diets. If you eat healthier on the weekends because you have more time, consider making extra healthy helpings that you can put in the refrigerator to eat during the busy weekdays. Keep frozen and canned vegetables in stock to supplement the main course. Grab a fresh apple, orange, or banana on your way out the door.

, The most difficult part of accessing your diet compared to the guidelines proposed by the food pyramid is determining how much you really ate. Even when you think you are eating healthy foods, too much is still too much. Therefore, evaluating the serving size of what you eat may be the most important part of understanding the food pyramid. Although not always practical, the best determination of serving size is to measure it.
It might be handy to make a compact chart that you can carry outside of the house or whenever you cannot use measuring cups.
If dining out, record what you ordered or take a picture of it with your cell phone so that when you return home, you can better estimate the serving size.

Pack the spinach in freezer-safe bags.,
Store the spinach in your freezer.",How to Freeze Spinach2," Fill one or more freezer-safe plastic bags with as much clean spinach as possible. Squeeze out any excess air, then seal the bags.Don't be afraid of packing the spinach too tightly. Tight packing is actually recommended since it leaves less room for excess air.
You could also use freezer-safe plastic storage bins, but these do not work quite as well since you won't be able to remove quite as much excess air from the container prior to sealing it.;
, Place the spinach in your freezer. It should remain edible for around six months.


When you're ready to use it, thaw the spinach in your refrigerator for several hours. Squeeze any excess moisture out of the thawed leaves before using or consuming them.
The cell membranes will break down during frozen storage, making thawed spinach too soft to eat raw, but you can still add it to smoothies and cooked recipes.

Boil water.,
Blanch the spinach for 2 minutes.,
Transfer the leaves to ice water.,
Dry the spinach.,
Stuff the spinach into freezer-safe bags.,
Store the spinach in your freezer.",How to Freeze Spinach3," Fill a large stockpot with enough cool water to cover the spinach, then set it on the stove over medium-high heat. Allow the water to reach a steady, rolling boil.


Note that traditional blanching will preserve the color and taste of the spinach but may cause a loss of some nutrients to occur. To reduce the amount of nutrients lost, consider steam-blanching instead. Prepare to steam-blanch by placing a steaming basket over the boiling water., Quickly dunk the full batch of spinach in the water and cover the stockpot. Start watching the clock immediately, and remove it after two minutes pass.If steam-blanching the spinach, place the leaves in the steamer basket and immediately cover it with the lid. A tightly sealed lid is necessary to capture enough steam to blanch the spinach.
If direct blanching the spinach, note that the water will likely turn green as it cooks.

, Scoop the spinach out of the stockpot and into a large bowl filled with ice water. Keep the spinach submerged for another two minutes in this cold water.


The quick transfer should stop the cooking process and halt the loss of nutrients. It should also further preserve the color and flavor of the spinach.

, Place the spinach in a salad spinner, then turn the spinner until the leaves seem dry.


If you do not have a salad spinner, place the spinach leaves in a large colander set out over dry paper towels. Allow the spinach to drain for around 20 minutes, then use additional paper towels to tap away any excess moisture.

, Pack the prepared spinach into freezer-safe plastic bags. Squeeze or suck as much air from the bags as possible before sealing them.


While you can technically use freezer-safe plastic containers instead of bags, doing so increases the risk of freezer burn since you won't be able to remove the excess air.

, Place the bags of spinach in your freezer for long-term storage. When prepared properly, blanched, frozen spinach should remain edible for around 9 to 14 months.


Thaw the frozen spinach in your refrigerator for several hours prior to use. Since thawed spinach tends to be soggy, it cannot be eaten raw but can be used in smoothies and cooked dishes.

Sweeten raspberries before storing them in the fridge.",How to Store Raspberries2," You do not want to freeze wet berries. This will cause frost damage, and the berries may stick together. Make sure to gently pat your berries dry with a paper towel prior to storing them in the freezer., In order to keep the berries from sticking together, you should freeze them on a sheet of wax paper. Lay the berries you wish to freeze down on a sheet of wax paper placed over a baking sheet. Make sure the berries do not touch. Only line the sheet with a single layer of berries.How long they take to freeze depends on the amount you're freezing and the strength of your freezer. Check on the raspberries every half hour ago until they're hard and frozen throughout.

, Leave the berries on the wax paper until they're completely frozen. Once they're frozen separately on the sheet of paper, it's safe to transfer them to a zip lock bag. The berries will stay separate in the bag after freezing on the sheet., You can also sweeten the berries before storing them. They can later be used for something like jam. You can sweeten them using a syrup made of water and sugar. Simply mix one part water with one part sugar.Place the berries in a sealable container, such as a mason jar.

, You should always wash raspberries prior to storage. This will help remove mold, debris, and contaminants that can make berries go bad fast. Do not wash raspberries under running tap water, as they are delicate. Running water can cause bruising.Instead, use a colander. Set the raspberries in the colander. Fill a bowl with cold water.
Drunk the colander into the bowl of cold water. Swish it around slightly to wash the berries.

, Even if raspberries do not have signs of mold, they may have been infected by moldy berries. You can remove mold by soaking the berries in a mixture of one cup white vinegar and 8 cups of water.Submerge your berries in the vinegar and water mixture.
Wash the berries gently in the mixture. Use the mixture to remove any visible dirt and grime from the berries. This process should also remove any spores that could cause mold.
When you're finished, dry the berries completely and then store them.

, A hot water batch can also kill bacteria that causes mold. This may prolong the shelf life of your berries. Heat some tap water to 125 degrees Fahrenheit.Dunk the raspberries in the hot water for about 30 seconds.
Remove the berries from the water, dry them off, and store them.

, Make sure you know when to discard your raspberries. You may be able to see mold growing on raspberries. They will also be stained in appearance and collect extra moisture. You should throw out raspberries once they have gone bad."

Cover and process the blender until the spinach breaks down into a smooth, thick puree.For many blenders, you may need to avoid filling the blender more than halfway to allow the blades adequate access to its contents.
You only need to add enough water to get the blender going. If your blender has a difficult time with the amount of water originally used, feel free to add more water in small increments.

, Once smooth, pour the puree into clean ice cube trays or similar molds. Fill each compartment within 1/4 inch (6 mm) of the top.


If you don't have any spare ice cube trays, consider using mini muffin trays, standard muffin trays, or candy molds.
Silicone trays and molds work especially well, but plastic versions can also be used.

, Place the filled trays in your freezer for around four hours, or until the spinach puree is frozen solid.

, Pop the frozen cubes of spinach out of their trays, then pack them into freezer-safe plastic bags. Remove excess air from the bags before sealing them.

Choose the freshest possible asparagus.,
Leave the rubber band around the bunch.,
Trim the ends if necessary.,
Fill a bag or jar with an inch of water.,
Store the asparagus upright in the container.,
Cover with a plastic bag.,
Change the water when it gets cloudy.",How to Store Asparagus1," Fresh asparagus should be bright green and firm from the tips all the way down the stalks. Check the bottom of the stalks: if they're tough and brown, that means the asparagus was not freshly cut.Avoid asparagus with discoloration or brown spots.
Don't choose asparagus that feels as though it's going limp.;
, Asparagus usually come bunched and tied with a rubber band. The band makes it more convenient to store the asparagus upright and preserve freshness, so leave it in place until you're ready to cook your asparagus.

, When you bring you asparagus home, you may need to trim half an inch or so from the ends of the stalks. Take a sharp knife and trim off the part that's a little tough and woody. Discard the cut ends.

, A glass mason jar is usually just the right size for a bunch of asparagus. An empty jelly jar or pickle jar also work well. If you're trying to save space in your refrigerator, go with a sturdy plastic storage bag. Fill your storage container with an inch or so of water, enough to submerge the ends of the asparagus.


There's no need to fill the container all the way to the top; you just enough water to keep the asparagus moist.
Another convenient method is to dampen a paper towel and wrap it around the cut ends of the asparagus. You'll need to change the paper towel every few days as it dries out.

, Storing the asparagus upright allows it to soak up the water from the container, keeping the stalks fresh and firm. If you're using a storage bag, rubber band the top of the bag around the asparagus so you can store it upright on the refrigerator door without spilling water.

, Use a loose plastic bag (the type used for produce at the grocery store) and drape it over the asparagus tips and jar. This will keep the asparagus tasting fresh; without the bag, the stalks will take on the flavor of whatever else you're keeping in your refrigerator., Check the water every few days and switch it out when it's no longer clear, just as you would for cut flowers. You should change the water no more than once or twice before consuming the asparagus within a week or so.

Pile good apples into the refrigerator.Apples stay fresher for a longer period of time when kept a little cold.,
Drape a damp paper towel over the apples in the refrigerator.,
Monitor the temperature, if possible.,
Keep an eye on your apples.",How to Store Apples1," One bad apple really can rot the bunch because apples produce a large amount of ethylene gas as they decay. As a result, you should not store damaged apples with undamaged apples.;
, When kept at room temperature in a basket, apples can stay fresh for about two days. This is not a long time, of course, but damaged apples should be eaten within a short amount of time no matter how you store them since a partially decayed apple is likely to spoil faster.


If the apples are too damaged for human consumption, you could also consider throwing them out into the woods for deer or other wildlife to enjoy. Even if no wild animal is interested, as the apples decay, they will provide a food source for various insects and other organisms living in the dirt.

, Most modern refrigerators have a fruit drawer or crisper drawer, and if your refrigerator has a drawer like this, you should store your apples there. If not, place the apples in an uncovered plastic container near the back of the refrigerator, where it tends to be coldest.

, Aside from cold temperatures, apples also need a small amount of moisture to stay their freshest. Laying a damp paper towel over the apples provides just enough moisture, but if you do cover the apples with a wet paper towel, you need to make sure that you do not seal them in an airtight container or drawer.

, If you have a temperature control dial for your crisper drawer, set it to a temperature between 30 and 35 degrees Fahrenheit (-1.1 to 1.7 degrees Celsius). This is the ideal temperature range for apples to be stored at. Storing them in colder conditions will cause the cells to break down, leading to mushy, inedible apples, and storing them in conditions that are warmer by only 10 degrees Fahrenheit (12.2 degrees Celsius) can cause the apples to ripen twice as quickly.


If you do not have temperature control settings that allow you to control the temperature by degrees, but you do have basic settings that allow you to make the refrigerator or crisper drawer colder or warmer, place a thermometer in the drawer and adjust the settings until the thermometer shows a number within the appropriate range.

, Stored this way, apples can stay fresh for up to three weeks.

Choose fresh, in-season asparagus that has not gone limp or woody. Avoid asparagus that is brown or discolored; it won't taste good after freezing.

, Chop about one inch from the ends of the asparagus. The chewy texture of the ends is unpleasant, especially after freezing, so make sure you get rid of the entire dry or woody part.

, In order to retain its flavor, asparagus should be blanched before freezing. This is the process of boiling the asparagus for about 30 seconds and removing it from heat before it loses its crunch. The asparagus is plunged into ice water to stop it from cooking. Boil a large pot of water and prepare a large bowl of ice water.

, In order for the asparagus to blanch evenly, it's best to chop it into smaller pieces. If you'd prefer to leave the stalks intact, that's fine, but the flavor may be compromised.

, If your spears are extra thick, boil them for longer; if they're thin, boil them for just thirty seconds. Monitor the asparagus carefully so you don't end up overcooking it., Use a slotted spoon to immediately transfer it to the ice bath so it can cool down and stop cooking. Leave it in the ice bath for the same amount of time you boiled it, then transfer it to a colander to let it drain and dry.

, Lay out the pieces on a baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and place the sheet in the freezer. Freeze the asparagus for about one hour, until each piece is slightly ice. Flash freezing the asparagus before longer-term storage will keep the pieces from freezing together into a solid mass.

, Put the frozen pieces into a freezer bag or a plastic freezer container. Pack it as tightly as possible in order to remove most of the air. Label the container with the date.


Frozen asparagus will keep for up to a year in properly cold conditions.
There's no need to thaw asparagus before cooking; just add it to soups and other dishes frozen.

"
Don't overcook the asparagus.,
Store the asparagus in an airtight container.,
Keep the asparagus refrigerated for five to seven days, maximum.",How to Store Asparagus3," Overcooked asparagus becomes mushy, and if you try to reheat it after storing it will be pretty much inedible. If you want to store your cooked asparagus, make sure it still has some bite left after cooking.



Blanching or steaming asparagus is a great way to bring out its flavor while retaining its crisp texture.
Sauteed and roasted asparagus also hold up well to storage if they aren't overcooked.
Boiling asparagus often results in a mushy texture, so avoid this method.

, Cooked asparagus will last the longest if you store it in a container with as little air as possible. A plastic or glass food storage container with a tight-fitting lid is best.

, Cooked asparagus is best within a few days of storing it. After that, it begins to lose its bright taste and firm texture."

Start with long-keeping apple varieties.,
Wrap each apple individually.Even apples that are in good shape give off a little ethylene gas, and as a result, apples that rub up against each other as they are in storage are more likely to rot faster.,
Line a crate or cardboard box with insulation.The container should not be airtight, since you do not want to completely restrict airflow to your apples as you store them, but it should keep out most of the air.,
Place your apples in the insulated container.,
Store the apples in a cold location.,
Do no store apples near potatoes.,
Check your apples after a few months.",How to Store Apples2," Tart, thick-skinned apples like Jonathans, Rome, Melrose, Fuji, and Granny Smiths are usually your best bet. Sweet, thin-skinned apples, like Red Delicious or Golden Delicious, do not generally do as well.


Also make sure that your apples are in good shape. Apples with soft spots or bruises give off a lot of ethylene gas, which can cause nearby apples to decay faster than normal and may thwart your storage efforts.

, Moreover, if one apple starts to rot while it is in storage, it could contaminate the other apples it touches, causing the entire bunch to spoil faster. Wrapping each apple individually prevents most of the potential damage caused when apples come into contact with each other.


Separate a section of newspaper into quarters and stack those quarters together. Choose a section that only has black ink since colored ink contains poisonous heavy metals.
Place one apple on top of the stack of newsprint. Bring the top sheet up and fold it around the apple, gently twisting the corners together the keep the apple wrapped. Do not twist too tightly, since you may tear the paper if you do. The objective is only to prevent the apple from coming into contact with other apples, not to keep the air out.
Continue wrapping each apple in a quarter sheet of newsprint until the entire bunch has been covered.

, Insulating the box also helps regulate the temperature of your apples and the amount of airflow it receives. Line the containers with straw or perforated plastic liners.

, Line them up side by side, making sure that the newsprint wrappings do not come undone and that the apples are not directly touching skin to skin.

, A root cellar is the most common location of choice, but an unheated basement, unheated attic, or enclosed porch can also work just as well. The average temperature of the area should not drop too far below freezing, however, since the freezing process will rupture the cells of your apples, turning them to mush when they thaw.

, Potatoes release a gas as they age, and this gas can cause apples to rot faster. You can keep the two types of produce in the same room or storage facility, but do not keep them side by side.

, Stored this way, apples can retain their freshness for several months, but will start to go bad after that.

Boil the jars.",How to Sterilize Bottles and Jars for Canning," Look for jars or bottles designed for canning purposes. They should be made of tempered glass and free of nicks and cracks.Be sure they each have appropriate tight-fitting lids.


Jars should have flat, gasket-lined lids with screw bands. Screw bands can be reused, but you'll need new flat lids.
Bottles should have rubber seals that are in good condition.;
, Use hot water and dish soap to thoroughly wash the jars and bottles you plan to sterilize. Make sure they are completely free of dried pieces of food and other debris. Wash the lids as well. They must be scrupulously clean.

, Put the jars and bottles upright in the pot. Place the lid rings around the jars and bottles. Fill the pot with water until it covers the jars and bottles by 1 inch (2.5 cm).

, Bring the water to a full, rolling boil. If you're at an altitude of less than 1,000 feet (304.8 m), boil them for 10 minutes. Add an additional minute for each additional 1,000 feet (304.8 m) of elevation., One by one, lift the jars, bottles and lids and place them on a paper towel to dry. Be careful not to let the sterilized equipment touch anything except the clean paper towel.

, Do this while the jars and the food are both still warm. Adding warm food to cold jars will cause the jars to crack.Leave 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) of headroom at the top of each jar and bottle.Wipe the rims of the jars and bottles to make sure food drops won't affect the seal.

, Screw on the lid rings and make sure the lids are securely fastened.

, The wire rack will keep the jars from touching the bottom of the pot, helping the contents of the jar get evenly cooked and ensuring that the jar seals properly. Use a jar lifter to place the jars on the rack., Fill the pot with water until the jars are covered by 2 inches (5.1 cm). Boil the jars for 10 minutes, then remove them from the pot with a jar lifter and place them on paper towels.Wait 24 hours before handling the jars. They should be completely cool before you put them into storage.
Check the jar lids. A slight indentation in the flat lids shows that they have been properly sealed. If any of the lids are not indented, open the jars and use the contents instead of storing them.

Store them in a cool, dry place once cooled.",How to Seal Glass Jars1," Before you can begin the process of sealing jars with a water bath, take some time to prepare the jars. First, inspect the jars and lids for nicks, cracks, or sharp and uneven edges. Check both the inner and outer layer of a jar's lid. Make sure the bends fit on all the jars. Defective jars should be thrown out.Once you've made sure all the jars are safe for use, hand wash your jars and lids in soapy warm water. After washing them thoroughly, set them to dry in a drying rack or on a clean dish towel., Place your jars in a large pot filled with water. The water should be hot but not boiling to start. The pot should be large enough so that the water completely covers the jars. Bring the water to a simmer. Keep the jars there until ready for use.








If you frequently need to seal glass jars with a water bath, consider purchasing a bath canner. This is a special device specifically designed to submerge jars in water for sterilization. However, this tool is mostly for convenience. If you do not have a bath canner, a large pot will work just as well., When using the water bath sealing method, make sure your foodstuff is naturally acidic or has added acid. This is the only way to guarantee that bacteria will not build up in your canned goods. While you're letting the jars sterilize, prepare your canning recipe.High-acid foods include fruits, fruit juices, jams, jellies and other fruit spreads, salsas, tomatoes with added acid, pickles, relishes, chutneys, sauces, vinegars and condiments.

, First, turn off the heat on the pot and remove your now sterilized jars from the pot with tongs. You can also buy specialized devices designed to remove jars from hot water, called a jar lifter. This may be slightly safer than tongs.Place the jars to dry in a drying rack or on a clean dish towel. Then bring the large pot to a low boil.







, Set the boiling water aside and fill your jars. For the best effects, use a tool known as a jar funnel which allows you to easily transfer liquid-like substances into your jars.









Make sure to leave some air space. For soft spreads, like jams and jellies, leave 1/4 of an inch. For solid foods, like fruits and pickles, leave 1/2 of an inch.Place the lid on the jar and screw the ring on.Tap the side of the jar with a wooden spoon to remove bubbles.
Repeat with the other jars.
Don’t screw the ring on too tightly or the excess air won’t be able to escape.

, The canning rack is a device that sits on the water bath canner or pot and ensures the glass jars don’t touch the bottom and break. Make sure you have a canning rack before beginning the sealing process. Never layer the jars on the rack. You may have to seal the jars in several batches depending on the size of your canning rack.








, Place the canning rack with the jars into the boiling water. Process them according to recipe directions. The processing (boiling) times will vary from recipe to recipe.









Processing time starts when the pot comes back to a boil.
Make sure there's about an inch or two of water above the lids of the jars. Add more water before returning it to a boil if necessary.

, Remove the rack with the jars and set them on your counter to cool overnight. Wear oven mitts when moving the rack to avoid injury. Use a pair of tongs or jar lifters to lift them carefully out of the rack.







, If the lid is not depressed, it is not sealed. You should eat it immediately instead of storing it or re-seal the jar with a new lid. Check the jar for cracks before doing so."

Place the unripe avocado into a brown paper bag.,
Add a banana, apple, or tomato to the brown paper bag.,
Store the bag, closed, at room temperature.,
Check regularly.",How to Ripen an Avocado1," The bag is used to trap the ethylene gas, which ripens the avocado. Make sure there aren't any holes in it!


The paper bag is just a trap. If you can devise some other mechanism that will trap in the air in the same way, great! That can be used, too. Your grandma might tell you to store it in the flour bin, but you may have to settle for the empty McDonald's bag.;
, Bananas are best, but the other fruits will do it, too. Some prefer using an apple because it can be used over and over again, even after it becomes old and wrinkly - it still emits gas. If you have none of these, but another avocado or two, put them all together.


These fruits emit more ethylene gas that other fruits. And the more ethylene gas they produce, the quicker everything will ripen., Keep it out of sunlight; 65º-75º F (18º-24º C) is best. If you don't have extra fruit in your bag, this will take 2-5 days., The added fruit will speed the ripening process considerably and it should ripen within 1 - 3 days.Your avocado is ready when it is easy to peel; feel it to see if it gives slightly as sometimes it's hard to tell by colour.


An unripe avocado will be nice and green. As it ripens, it will get hints of purple and black (that's when you can use it in about 2 days). When it's ready for your next meal, it's so dark green/brown it's practically purplish black.Once it's ripe, it will keep in the fridge for a few days, but it will lose its taste as time progresses."
"
Gather the fruit before it is very ripe.,
Prepare the fruit by thoroughly washing it, and for fruits where it is desirable, peeling and removing the pits or seeds.

,
Put it in wide-mouthed bottles.,
Fill them as full as they will hold and cork them tight.,
Seal the corks.,
Put some hay in a large saucepan.,
Set in the bottles with hay between them to prevent their touching.,
Fill the saucepan with water to the necks of the bottles (or jars, if using modern materials), and set it over the fire (or on the stove top) until the water is nearly boiled away.,
Take the pot off the fire or stove, and let it stand until the bottles are cool.

,
Store the bottles or jars in a cool place until wanted, when the fruit will be found equal to fresh.

",How to Preserve Fruit Without Sugar," Slightly under ripe fruit has firmer flesh that stands up to the process used for preserving it better than very ripe fruit.;
,, Canning jars with dome type lids using modern latex seals create a safer seal than do old cork-stoppered canning bottles described in the original instructions.

, If using canning jars, install dome lids and bands and tighten snugly.

, This is done by melting paraffin wax and dipping the corks in it.

, This will prevent the bottles from bumping together while the water is boiled, which could cause them to crack.

, You may choose to use cotton washcloths if hay is not easily obtainable, but remember, these instructions were originally published in the mid-19th century, so many homes had livestock, and hay was plentiful.

, The idea is to heat the fruit inside the jars to a sufficiently hot temperature to sterilize the contents without actually cooking them.

Store potatoes someplace cool.,
Make sure that the storage area is dry, and don't wash the potatoes before you store them.,
Keep potatoes in a paper bag to ensure proper ventilation.,
Keep the potatoes someplace dark.,
Avoid storing potatoes in places that tend to get warm.",How to Stop Potatoes from Sprouting in Storage1," The ideal temperature is somewhere between 45 and 50°F (7 and 10°C).You can, however, store potatoes in places as cool as 38 and 42°F (3.4 and 5.6°C), without affecting the flavor or texture too much.Wherever you decide to store the potatoes, make sure that the temperatures remain consistent. If they change too much, the potatoes may start to rot or sprout.If you store the potatoes below 40°F (4.5°C), use them within 6 to 8 months.If you store the potatoes above 40°F (4.5°C), use them within 3 to 4 months.;
, Save the washing for when you are ready to cook them. If you wash the potatoes first, you risk trapping moisture in the skin. This can cause the potatoes to rot sooner.If the storage area is too dry, your potatoes may shrivel. If this happens, move the potatoes to a place with higher humidity; about 80 to 90 percent would be ideal.Make sure that the potatoes get good air circulation, however, or they will rot., Avoid plastic bags, as they tend to trap warmth and moisture.A mesh or perforated plastic bag is fine, however, because it will allow for air circulation without causing the potatoes to dry out.Here are some other, suitable containers to store potatoes in:


Baskets
Cardboard boxes
Cotton or muslin bags
Wooden crates or boxes

, Ideal storage places include basements, cabinets, closets, and garages.Too much light, especially sunlight, can cause the potatoes to start sprouting. It can also cause the potatoes to overproduce a chemical called Solanine, which causes them to turn green and taste bitter.If you notice the skin turning green, cut it off before you cook and eat the potato.If the green has gotten into the potato flesh itself, throw the potato away.

, These include cabinets beneath the sink and next to large appliances, such as stoves and refrigerators. Potatoes will start to sprout if they are kept in a warm area."

Turn the vacuum sealer on.,
Screw the ring onto the jar.",How to Seal Glass Jars2," You'll need a vacuum pack machine. You'll also need a glass jar sealing attachment for your vacuum sealer. This is a special type of device that fits over glass jars, like mason jars, and allows you to vacuum seal your jars.

, It's a good idea to sterilize any jars you're using as a precaution. You can boil them or run them through a very hot dishwasher. If you're boiling them, put them in a pot with water that completely covers the jars. Bring the pot to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and let them stay there until you're ready to use them., While waiting for the jars to sterilize, prepare the food you're going to can. This may mean following a recipe for a jam or a jelly.However, many people store easily breakable items that cannot be stored in bags in vacuum-sealed jars. For example, you may want to store something like small candies or nuts in a vacuum-sealed jar.When you're done preparing the food, you can remove the jars from the boiling water. Use either tongs or a jar lifters. Allow them to dry and then add the food.
Once again, leave some airspace. With soft spreads, like jams or jellies, leave 1/4 an inch of airspace. Whole foods, like nuts or candies, need 1/2 an inch of airspace.Use a non-metallic spoon to remove bubbles. Do so by running the wooden or rubber spoon around the inner surface of the jar, pressing the food down gently., Once your food is prepared, you can begin to prepare the vacuum. Place the lid on the jar you're going to seal. However, leave the lid ring off for now. Attach the hose of the vacuum pack sealer to the jar sealer attachment. From there, place the attachment over the jar. Make sure the attachment is on firm so it does not fall of when you begin vacuuming the jar., You should process the jar according to your specific device instructions. However, in most cases you simply turn the device on until the machine indicates the jar is sealed. You should hear the lid pop when it is ready. The machine may also indicate, through a sign like a green light, that the process is complete., Remove the hose from the sealing attachment. Remove the sealing attachment from the jar. Then screw the ring tightly onto the jar. Store the jar in a cool, dry place."

You should be able to find a lot of these supplies at a local craft store or department store. However, if you can't find them in your area you should be able to order them online. This process is best for glass jars and bottles with slim necks., If you've purchased a wax sealer dish with a place for the candle beneath it, you can just place the sealer on the table. If not, you'll need to put it on a small rack so that a candle can go beneath it.

, Light a tea candle. Then, place it beneath the wax heating dish.

, Add granular wax in any color to the ceramic dish. As the wax melts, add more wax to the dish until the liquefied wax is about 2cm from the top of the dish.


The wax will take about 20 minutes to melt. Blow out the candle when it's finished.

, Twist the cap on the bottle. Make sure the cap is on tight. If it isn’t used for eating, you can use a cork instead.

, Wrap the filament tape around the cork or the cap where it meets the jar until it overlaps on itself. Cut the filament tape. Bend the end that's sticking out and push it against the rest of the tape. The bent part will be what is pulled to undo the seal.

, Turn the jar upside down. Dip it straight down into the wax. Lift it straight up a moment later. Spin it as soon as you remove it from the wax to prevent unwanted dripping.

, This step is optional. Press your engraved wax seal into the top immediately after dipping. A monogrammed or symbolic wax seal is a great way to personalize your project. Allow it to sit and dry completely before transporting."

, Place the two halves back together and wrap it in plastic wrap as if it were whole. Place it in the refrigerator.


If you don't have plastic wrap, use an airtight, resealable container.

, The length of time it needs to ripen all depends on how far along your avocado was in the process. Take it out and prod it -- when it becomes soft and seems edible, give it a taste test. If it's not quite there, put it back in.

Keep uncut, unripe avocados at room temperature.,
For cut, sliced, or mashed avocados, use lemon juice.,
If bad becomes worse, puree your avocado and freeze it.,
Monitor the stages of ripeness.",How to Ripen an Avocado3," Putting them in the refrigerator is a no-no. They will not ripen in cold temperatures.If you do absolutely nothing (apart from placing it on your countertop) your avocado may take up to six days to ripen.

You can place the avocado in the refrigerator if you want to delay ripening; it will keep longer there than on the counter. A day or two before you need it, take it back out and ripen in a bag as noted above., Even if it's in guacamole form, sprinkle a bit of lemon, lime, or even orange juice (so long as it's fresh!) over your avocado. The acid will slow the browning process (otherwise known as oxidation), prolonging your avocado's life.


If you're starting to see brown, you don't need to throw it all away. Just scoop out the brown parts and get to using the rest before it goes, too.If your avocado is cut in half and not mashed or chopped, you can avoid flavoring it with lemon by simply running water over the cut surface, and putting it in the fridge. It will look worse than with lemon juice, but that's a skin that actually keeps the rest of it fresh for longer. The thin browning skin peels back easily, and you have a fresh, avocado-flavored avocado.

, If your avocado is prime time to be used, but your schedule just isn't allowing it, puree it and put it in the freezer. Don't freeze it whole, the taste will disintegrate. You can then still use the avocado for dips and spreads, etc.Obviously, your avocado is best if not frozen. This should be a measure taken only if it cannot be eaten fresh.

, Hopefully you've had a few days to bond with your avocados. If you've been watching them, you'll have a good grasp on how far along in the process they are. At different stages, they'll yield different results.


If your avocado is just starting to turn ripe, it will be less directed by heat. You can grill or bake it more easily.
If your avocado took a while to ripen but finally did, it should produce slices that will do well in salads and salsas. The firm slices will look beautiful on your dishes!
If you have a bunch of ripe avocados, turn 'em all into something cream-based. Think flans, ice cream, or cheesecakes. An excuse to experiment!

Avoid storing potatoes near onions, apples, bananas, pears, and other fruit.There seems to be a lot of debate regarding whether or not apples can keep potatoes from sprouting.,
Consider keeping some herbs with the potatoes.,
Try using spearmint or peppermint essential oils.,
Understand that potatoes will eventually sprout, usually within 1 to 4 months.",How to Stop Potatoes from Sprouting in Storage2," Recent studies, however, have shown that apples release ethylene gas as they ripen, which helps encourage sprouting in potatoes. The same studies have also shown that potatoes can cause apples to become soft and mushy.On the other hand, some people found that keeping an apple or two with potatoes will keep sprouting at bay.

, Studies have shown that herbs, such as lavender, rosemary, and sage, contain oils which help prevent rot and decay in potatoes.These same oils may also help keep the potatoes from sprouting.

, Soak a small piece of blotter paper with the essential oil, and tuck it into the container with the potatoes. Studies have shown that these oils can inhibit sprouting in potatoes.Reapply the essential oil every 2 to 3 weeks, or when needed.Avoid using this method if your storage container is made from metal or plastic. Essential oils can deteriorate these materials.Clove essential oil may also be used, but it requires a thermal or aerosol application, and thus not recommended for home use., Nothing lasts forever, especially food. While you can keep potatoes from sprouting prematurely, eventually they will start to go bad and sprout. Depending on the variety, potatoes will start forming sprouts naturally between 30 and 140 days.Some people find that the following varieties generally last longer than others: Katahdin, Yellow Finn, and Yukon Gold.If you are storing a variety of potatoes, eat the varieties that don't last as long first.

Use a pH testing strip to test your pH balance.,
Change your diet.,
Check your medications, as certain medications can cause your pH balance to be acidic.,
Monitor your stress level, as stress can be a cause of acidic pH balance.",How to Correct High Acid pH With High Alkali Foods," You can either test your urine or saliva. Test 60 minutes before eating a meal and 2 hours after eating. This will give you the best range of pH. Test twice a week.


Testing the pH of your urine will show how well your body is able to remove acids and maintain optimal amounts of minerals that protect the body from becoming too acidic. The ""buffer minerals"" include sodium, magnesium, calcium, and potassium. If you are acidic, then your body is not doing a good job at using the minerals to protect against the acid, because there is too much acid in your body. For a healthy range, your urine pH should be between 6.0 and 6.5 when you test in the morning, and between 6.5 and 7.0 when you test in the evening.
Testing the pH of your saliva will help show digestive enzyme activity in the body. For a healthy range, your saliva pH should remain between 6.5 and 7.5 all day.;
, Eat more alkaline foods and less acidic foods.


Alkaline foods include green juice, vegetable juice, fruit juice, garlic, berries, oranges, bananas, kale, pumpkins, squash, peas, green tea, and most other fruits and vegetables. However, Some fruits are quite acidic, e.g. cranberries, plums, rhubarb, blackberries and prunes. So are fruit juices that are processed, as opposed to simply squeezed from the original.
Acidic foods may include meat (animal protein), dairy, white rice, wheat and white flour, including pasta. Amaranth, millet, and quinoa are good grains. All meats are acidic though beef, pork and shellfish are the worst.
Almonds are a great alkaline protein source, but peanuts and walnuts are very acidic, pecans and cashews are also acidic.
Soy milk is alkaline, green tea and tisanes are alkaline, but black tea and alcohol are acidic.
Raw spinach is great, but cooked spinach not so much (though it’s not the worst).

, If you are not sure, speak to your doctor. If the medication is necessary and you cannot avoid it, you may help combat the acidic pH by eating alkaline foods.

, If you made dietary changes and included less acidic foods in your diet and still notice a high acid pH balance, stress could be the culprit. Utilize stress reduction techniques to help reduce acidity.

Pay attention to the quantity of wine you use.,
Substitute wine for water in any recipe.,
Marinate foods in wine before you cook them.,
Add red wine to gravy for extra flavor.,
sauté food in wine mixed with oil.,
Add sweet wine or dessert wine to baked items or desserts.,
Baste meat and poultry that you are roasting with wine.,
Reduce wine slowly over low heat, for best flavor results.,
Experiment with cooking with wine.",How to Cook With Wine," Do not use a wine to cook if you would never drink it in a glass or serve it with food.


Start with a basic red or white wine. An example of a good white to cook with is Sauvignon Blanc. Try Chianti or Cabernet Sauvignon for a red.
Avoid using wines that are labeled ""cooking wines."" These wines contain a lot of salt and other additives and you would never drink them in a glass.;
, Think of it as similar to a seasoning. Too little wine will be lost, and too much will be overpowering.


Start with small amounts, and add gradually. Remember that you can always add more wine, but you cannot take back what you have already put in.

, Wine will provide the moisture that the water would have helped with, and add a nice flavor to what you are cooking.

, Wine that is room temperature can tenderize meats. You can also marinate vegetables in wine before you grill, roast, sauté or bake them.

, Stir in 1 or 2 tbsp. at a time until you reach the flavor you desire.

, This will work for meat and vegetables. Heat the wine before you add the food but do not let the wine boil or it will lose flavor.

, Use sherry in recipes for baked goods, or splash some wine over ice cream or cheesecake.

, You can mix the wine with oil or melted butter as well as a stock, or use it on its own.

, It can make a nice sauce if you reduce it over time.


Warm wine before you add food to a pan as well. Heating the wine before you cook food in it will provide more moisture to the food and prepare the pan or pot for cooking.

, The more you use wine in your recipes and cooking, the better you will be able to predict the taste and flavor.

Decide which sugar substitute to use.,
Natural sugar substitutes have calories and sugar in them, but may help control blood sugar levels and contribute other potential health benefits.,
Choose a recipe.,
Purchase ingredients.,
Taste the sugar substitute.,
Do a trial run.",How to Cook With Sugar Substitutes," There are natural sugar substitutes and artificial sugar substitutes.;
, Artificial sugar substitutes have little or no calories and have little effect on blood sugar levels. The most popular natural and artificial sweeteners are:


Honey: This is slightly sweeter than sugar and higher in moisture. Honey is good for use in baking because it has browning and bulking properties. Honey also contributes to mouth feel and tenderness. It can be used 1 for 1 as a substitute, but because of honey’s higher moisture content, some of the other liquids in the recipe may need to be reduced. Honey has been shown to raise blood sugar levels slower than sugar and have anti-microbial properties.
Agave Nectar: Agave nectar affects blood glucose less than sugar and is about 1.5 times sweeter. Agave nectar is also good for baking because it has good browning properties and helps retain moisture in products. It is a liquid, and, like honey, liquids in the recipe will need to be decreased to compensate.
Stevia: The highly refined Reb-A, an extract from the Stevia plant, is available for use in food. It can be 300 times sweeter than sugar. It does not affect blood sugar levels and has no calories. It works very well in sweetening beverages and goes well with citrus flavors. It has a slight bitter note, but can be masked by blending with sugar or using certain flavors, such as orange or vanilla. Stevia works well in beverages, but would need to be blended with sugar for baking. When blending with sugar, for every half cup the sugar is reduced by, add 3 1/2 tbsp. of stevia.
Sucralose: This is 600 times sweeter than sugar and has been made popular under the brand name “Splenda.” Sucralose is very soluble in water and works well for beverages. It also works well for baking, but it needs to be combined with another sweetener to add bulk.
Acesulfame Potassium: This is 200 times sweeter than sugar and can easily be found in the grocery store. This sweetener works well for beverages and will work well for baking when combined with other sweeteners to bulk it up. It can have a bitter aftertaste that can be masked by using other sweeteners with it or putting it in bitter foods (coffee, tea, chocolate, etc.).
Saccharin: This is 300 times sweeter than sugar. This sweetener works best in cold items, such as beverages and whipped cream. It doesn’t work well for baking because the heat brings out a bitter taste.
Aspartame: This is 200 times sweeter than sugar. This sweetener also works best in cold items. When it is heated it breaks down and is no longer sweet. For this reason it is not recommended for baking at all.

, Desserts are a good way to begin cooking with sugar substitutes because they tend to have the most sugar in them. It is also good to start with cold items, such as ice cream or sweetened beverages. This way you can become familiar with the taste of the sugar substitute before diving into cooking with it. Keep in mind that the recipe you choose may need to be modified to work well with the different sweetener.

, Most of the substitutes listed above have name brands and generic brands that can be easily found in any supermarket. Some of them come pre-mixed with sugar or maltodextrin so they will measure exactly like sugar and it will make baking with them much easier.


It is important to purchase enough to make the recipe at least twice because it might take more than one try to get the recipe correct when using the sugar substitute.

, Before cooking with your sugar substitute of choice, taste it, eat a cracker, and then taste regular sugar. You should take note of the differences and begin to modify your recipe based on this. When tasting the sweeteners that are much sweeter than sugar, only taste a pinch; too much and you will be tasting it all day. You may find that you need less than you thought after tasting the sweeteners. Even the sweeteners that are already pre-mixed with sugar or maltodextrin may be too sweet to substitute 1 for 1.

, You should evaluate your finished dish for taste, color and texture. If you are unsure of how the final item should taste, then make one with sugar to taste beside the one with the sugar substitute. After the taste test, improve if necessary and make it again. This is a case where practice can greatly improve the final results.

Heat in pan for sauteing.,
Paint pieces of meat to get a pleasing sear.,
Coat roasting ingredients for a crispy exterior.,
Use it to keep ingredients from sticking.,
Use it as a finishing oil.",How to Cook with Olive Oil1," One of the most common uses for olive oil is as a saute oil. In this style of cooking, a small amount of oil is used to fry the food in a pan on the stove top. The oil keeps the food from sticking to the pan and adds a light sear along with some flavor. Try adding a tablespoon to a hot pan before tossing in your main ingredients in a stir fry or similar pan-cooked dish.


Olive oil tends to have a fairly low smoke point (see ""Tips"" below). At high heats, it will smoke and gain a slightly bitter taste. For this reason, it's not usually a good choice for deep-frying (cooking by submerging in very hot oil).;
, Pieces of meat like steaks, pork chops, and chicken wings tend to taste best if they have a crisp, golden-brown exterior (in cooking, this is called a ""sear""). A good way to get this is to paint both sides of the meat with a little olive oil before laying it on a hot surface. Flip the meat infrequently to allow the sear to form.


Try tossing the meat in your favorite dry seasonings after you apply the olive oil. The seasonings will stick to the oil, giving you a finished product with a flavorful crust.
In this role, olive oil isn't just for the stove. You can use it on the grill by painting it directly on the bars with a grill brush.

, Roasting is a style of cooking that uses dry heat from all directions to get meat or vegetables tender on the inside and crispy on the outside (think a Thanksgiving roast turkey). To get a tasty exterior similar to the sear you'd get in the step above, apply a thin coat of olive oil to the entire outside surface of the food you're roasting. Don't use too much — this can lead to a greasy, soaked exterior rather than a crisp crust.


If you're roasting many small things as opposed to one large thing, just put the ingredients in a bowl, pour in a little olive oil, and shake to coat them. This is a good way to roast vegetables like green beans, chickpeas, broccoli, and more.

, Sometimes, olive oil is used as a sort of ""lubricant"" to keep pieces of food from sticking together. Its mild flavor and its slick texture exterior make it perfect for this. You don't typically need very much oil to get this effect. About a tablespoon should do for most dishes.


Olive oil is most famous for being used this way to cook pasta. Adding a tablespoon of oil to the boiling water just before adding the pasta ensures that the noodles won't cling to each other in the strainer or on your plate.

, When olive oil is added to dishes at the very end of the cooking process, it is called a ""finishing oil."" In this case, it's usually being used to complement the food's flavor and texture or give it a pleasing presentation. Here, again, you don't need much. A teaspoon or two gently drizzled over the finished dish is usually plenty.


This is another case where pasta is a common example. Lightly dressing a plate of pasta with a little oil can give it a smoother texture and a pleasing aroma along with a satisfying ""heft"" from the added calories.

, Cut using a sharp knife or mandoline.

, This is called a citrus bath. It is used with some fruits and vegetables to lock in enzymes and avoid browning of the produce's flesh. Bananas and apples should be soaked for 5 minutes in a citrus bath, shaken off, and then placed on the dehydrator's trays. Strawberries and cherries do not need to be pretreated.


Use an apple peeler to peel apples before hydrating, if you plan on dehydrating a lot of apples. They will allow you to slice them easily and cut the amount of time it will take you to dry your batch.
Pit cherries and cut in half before dehydrating. They can take between 12 and 20 hours.
Dry cranberries by freezing them, boiling them and then laying them out on the dehydrator.

, Plug in the dehydrator, cover and set the temperature. Fruit is usually dried at temperatures between 130 and 145 degrees Fahrenheit (54 to 63 degrees Celsius).


Drying times vary between dehydrators. The more liquid content the fruit have, the longer they will take. Oranges, tomatoes, lemons and bananas usually take 10 hours or longer. These are great to dehydrate overnight.
Dry fruits with equal time. They will not leech flavors from each other.

, Place them in a cool, dark pantry to ensure they cannot be spoiled by sunlight or heat.

, Spread the mixture on plastic wrap at 110 to 118 degrees Fahrenheit (43 to 48 degrees Celsius) for 4 hours. When the leather is dry on the bottom side, peel it off the plastic wrap and put it with the opposite side down on the fan of the dehydrator. Dry for 1 to 2 more hours, until it is at your desired consistency.

Know the benefits of a convection toaster oven.,
Lower the temperature for a convection oven.,
Reduce the cooking time.,
Use the correct pans.,
Don't cover your food.,
Check your food as it cooks.,
Know which foods cook best in a convection toaster oven.,
Know that most recipes can be converted.",How to Cook With a Convection Toaster Oven," A traditional oven has heating elements on top and bottom of the oven. A convection oven differs by having a fan in addition to the heating elements. The fan continuously circulates air through the oven as the food cooks. This process of blowing hot air over the food as it cooks makes the food cook more evenly.Traditional ovens can leave your food uneven in some places, or cause you to have to switch racks.;
, Convection ovens cook your food much faster and at a lower temperature than in a conventional oven. The reason for this is that the fan circulates the heat around the food more quickly, so the food cooks in a shorter amount of time and more evenly., In addition to cooking faster and at a lower temperature, convection toaster ovens have other benefits. Toaster ovens are smaller, which take up less space in your kitchen. This might be important if you live in a small apartment or are cramped for space. They also release less heat into your home, which can be a benefit during the summer when turning on the oven can significantly increase the heat in your home. Now, convection settings are available in toaster ovens instead of just larger ovens. This gives you the convenience of a toaster oven, with the benefits of a convection oven. The heat in your home is reduced, while you save time and energy costs by the shorter, more efficient convection setting and the use of a smaller appliance., Because the air circulates around the food, the temperature should be lowered from a traditional recipe when cooking with a convection oven. Most baking recipes suggest lowering the temperature by 20-25 degrees when cooking in a convection oven., Since convection ovens cook much faster, reduce the time you would use for a conventional oven. Start by reducing the time by 1/3 of the original recipe.


You can use a convection calculator to get a more precise estimate if you can't find a recipe geared towards a convection oven., Since convection ovens cook just a bit differently, you want to use different pans to maximize the benefits of your convection toaster oven. Use cookie sheets with no sides. Make sure your baking and roasting pans have low sides. This helps the airflow reach your food.Rimless, non-insulated pans lined with parchment paper work well for cookies.Place the baking tray on the rack that is under the rack the food is on to catch drip. This allows airflow to reach the food while still catching the drip.

, When cooking in a convection oven, don't cover your food. Since airflow is part of the cooking process when using a convection oven, covering the food blocks this flow. Refrain from covering your food with foil or a top., Just like with a conventional oven, keep an eye on your food as it cooks in a convection toaster oven. Check it about 3/4 of the way through, or 10 minutes before it should be finished. This will help you make sure you don't overcook and undercook food in the toaster oven.

, You can cook most foods in a convection oven, but some foods work better than others. A convection oven cooks drier than a conventional oven, which can sometimes be more humid and steamier. Because of this, these foods work best in a convection oven:


Meat. Because of the dry heat, meat is roasted much better in a convection oven. The process can give you perfect, crackling skin but a moist inside.
Pies and cookies. Cookies will end up brown and uniform, while pastries will be flaky and fluffy. Cakes and bread don't do as well because of the dry heat; they could end up dry instead of moist., Once you understand what a convection oven is, cooking with one is relatively simple. Just about every recipe can be adapted. Just remember the above steps: lower the temperature, shorten the cook time, keep an eye on it, and lower the sides of your pan. Everything else - the ingredients, the preparation of the dish - is just like a traditional recipe."

, This will still keep your refrigerator cool for the non-perishable items you want to store, for example canned food, cereal boxes, and other pantry items. It will also save you money since there's not a whole lot coldness building up., Anything that can melt easily will need to be removed, such as ice cream or any kids' Popsicles., Despite having frozen food still stored in the freezer, the temperature will still keep it cold a good period of time and in addition with the refrigerator, changing the temperature will use less energy while you are gone., Empty both sections out completely (or one or the other if connected). Crumble newspapers and replace your food with the newspapers and a charcoal briquette. This method will work like baking soda stored in the refrigerator - it will help keep mildew, mold, and the smell out., It's best to tape any plugs to the wall or appliance itself to avoid stray plugs or have it drop in a place that you can't reach the cord., Remove the newspapers & coal. Do a minor wipe-down or scrub on the drawers and sides. This may be a little annoyed since you would need to buy everything again, but think of this, you would now know that everything is fresh and organized in your freezer/refrigerator."

Toss in a salad with acidic ingredients for an easy dressing.,
Use as the oil base of a marinade.,
Use as a dipping sauce.,
Use as a fatty base in savory baking recipes.",How to Cook with Olive Oil2," Take advantage of olive oil's bright, pungent flavor by using it as the base for a salad dressing. Most dressings mix oil with acidic items such as tomatoes, citrus juices, or vinegar to ""cut"" the fatty-ness of the oil and give the dish a tangy quality.


Tart ingredients in the salad itself also tend to pair well with olive oil. Try using it in the dressing for a salad containing slices of sour apples, strawberries or sharp cheeses for interesting flavor combinations.

, Marinades are mixes of ingredients that foods are soaked in before cooking for extra flavor. In this role, olive oil tends to complement foods with earthy flavors, such as meat, poultry, mushrooms, legumes, nuts, and whole grains. Olive oil marinades can also be enhanced by fresh herbs - thyme, savory, basil, tarragon, and dill work very well.


Like salad dressings, most marinades also have an acidic ingredient in addition to the oil to keep it from tasting too greasy or heavy.

, Sometimes olive oil's smooth flavor is best enjoyed on its own. A small bowl of olive oil works great for dipping appetizers like bread, bruschetta, vegetables, and many more. Add acids or herbs like garlic, thyme, and sage to the oil to give it a more complex, interesting flavor.


One common example of this is the mix of olive oil and balsamic vinegar that is often served with bread at Italian restaurants. The bread is used to soak of some of the oil mixture and carry it to your mouth for a satisfying (but not overly heavy) appetizer.

, Olive oil isn't an extremely common ingredient in baking — its flavor is more suited to meats and vegetables than it is to pastries and desserts. However, olive oil is great for adding an extra dimension to certain breads and rolls that are designed to have a savory flavor. Baking recipes that contain ingredients that traditionally go with olive oil (like this rosemary bread recipe) tend to be the best choices.If you're adventurous, you can even substitute olive oil for vegetable oil or canola oil in ordinary baking recipes to give them a new flavor. You may want to add a few more ingredients that go well with olive oil to complement the flavor. For example, try substituting olive oil for vegetable oil in your favorite pancake recipe. Mix a few minced cloves of garlic and some caramelized onions into the batter for a savory treat.

Clean and dry your vegetables.,
Cut vegetables into uniform slices.,
Place vegetables evenly on the racks, without overlapping.,
Dehydrate garlic and onions separately.",How to Use a Food Dehydrator2," Vegetable dehydration is common with gardeners who like to preserve the excesses of their harvest for the winter months.;
, Use a mandoline or a meat slicer to achieve this easily. It is important to have uniform slices so that they take the same amount of time to dry.


Many vegetables need to be pre-processed in order to avoid a change of color. Steam broccoli, eggplant and carrots for a short time.
Blanche summer squash, cauliflower, potatoes, sweet potatoes or carrots until they are soft but still crisp. To blanche means to plunge something in boiling water for a few seconds or minutes, then put them on ice. This locks in enzymes and starches so it will contain the same enzymes and be nutritious when it is rehydrated. You do not need to pre-process zucchini. Spray lemon juice on carrots to keep the color.

, Dehydrate using temperatures between 130 and 145 degrees Fahrenheit (54 to 63 degrees Celsius).


To create roasted flavors in your peppers, cut them in half, broil them until they start to blister, cool and then dehydrate them skin side down.

, Other vegetables will absorb the flavor if you dry them together.

Store your dried cranberries in the freezer.",How to Dry Cranberries," (63.9 oz.) of water into a large pot. Bring the water to a boil and then remove the pot from the heat. You do not want to place cranberries in water that is boiling too hard because you are actually blanching them rather than cooking them.;
, (340 g) of fresh cranberries into a colander. Rinse them with cool water and then pat them dry. Lay them out on some paper towels and pick out any that are old or damaged in some way., Let the cranberries soak in the water but keep an eye on them. There skins will start to break open because of their contact with the heat. Once all of the cranberry skins have cracked, removed them from the water. Pour the cranberries into a strainer. Drain them thoroughly, making sure to remove as much excess water as possible.Do not allow the cranberries to get too hot or stay in the water too long after their skins have cracked. Doing either of these things will cause the skins to become mushy.

, While the oven is heating, line a baking sheet with paper towels. Pour the cranberries onto the paper towels. The paper towels will absorb extra water that might still be clinging to the cranberries., Pat them dry as well as you can--getting rid of any moisture will shorten the drying time. If you are planning on sweetening the berries, now is the time to do so. Sprinkle one to three tablespoons of sugar or corn syrup onto the berries, depending on how sweet you would like your cranberries to be. If you are not sweetening your cranberries, disregard the latter half of this step., This is the one you will be placing in the oven. Line it with a layer of paper towels and then place a sheet of parchment paper on top. Spread the cranberries evenly over the surface of the parchment paper., Place the cranberries in the oven and wait. The drying process can take between six and ten hours, depending on the strength of your oven and the dryness of the cranberries. It also depends on if you prefer your cranberries dry or crunchy. If you want them chewier, take them out at around six hours., Air circulation is part of the drying process so you will need to rotate the baking sheet several times while the cranberries are drying. Keep an eye on your cranberries throughout the drying process--some ovens will dry cranberries out more quickly than others. If you notice your cranberries getting very dry before the six hour mark, take them out of the oven., Let them berries cool down before you do anything with them. To store dried cranberries, place them in an airtight container and keep them in the refrigerator. You can also place them in the freezer and keep them there until you want to use them at a future date., of granulated sugar (optional.) You can also use corn syrup to sweeten your cranberries. You should mix the cranberries with the sugar or syrup in a bowl, making sure that the berries are evenly coated. Cranberries can sometimes have a bitter or sour flavor so adding the sugar guarantees sweetness. For unsweetened cranberries, skip this step., Lay the berries evenly on the baking sheet, making sure that none of them are overlapping. If they overlap, they could freeze together, making large cranberry chunks., Freeze the cranberries for two hours. Placing the cranberries in the freezer dries them out quickly because it breaks down the berries’ cell structure., You should place the berries on a mesh sheet and place it in the dehydrator. Turn the dehydrator on and leave the berries in there for 10 to 16 hours.Before taking them out, check to make sure that all of the moisture has been removed from the berries. Test one out to see if it is has a good chewiness. If it’s too chewy, place them back in the dehydrator.

, Place your cranberries in an airtight container and either place them in the freezer for later use or in the refrigerator if you plan on eating them in the near future."

Select fruits that are suitable for drying.,
Choose ripe fruit.,
Wash the fruit.,
Cut larger fruit into into very thin slices.,
Lay fruit on a parchment covered cooking sheet.,
Place tray of fruit in oven.,

,
Choose a hot day.,
Place the fruit on screens.,
Place the tray in sunlight.,
Collect the fruit after several days.,
Set the dehydrator to its ""fruit"" setting.,
Dry the fruit for 24 to 48 hours.,
Collect the finished fruit.,
Store in an airtight container in a cool place.,
Use dried fruits for cooking, baking and eating as they are.",How to Make Dried Fruit," Not all fruits will dry well, so focus only on the ones known to produce excellent results when dried. These include:


Vine fruits such as grapes, kiwifruit. Note that grapes produce different types of dried fruits: Zante currants come from from a tiny, seedless black grape; sultanas come from a sweet, seedless green/white grape; and raisins come from large, sweet grapes such as muscat.Tree fruits such as stone fruit (apricots, peaches, plums, nectarines), mangoes, bananas, apples, figs, dates and pears.;
, Make sure that the fruit you use is mature, firm, and ripe. Fruit that is damaged, unripe, or overripe will lack nutritional value, won't dry as well, and won't taste as good since the sugars aren't at their peak stage of development., Rinse the fruit under cool, running water, scrubbing it gently with your fingers to remove any visible dirt or debris. Pat the fruit dry with a clean paper towel when finished.


For small vine fruits, like berries or grapes, you could place the fruit in a colander and rinse it that way.

, Most tree and bush fruits need to be cut into slices roughly 1⁄8 to 1⁄4 inch (0.3 to 0.6 cm) thin, but many small vine fruits (berries and grapes) can be left whole.Grapes or berries with inner seeds might need be sliced in halves and de-seeded.You should also trim away any stems or leaves at this time.

, The fruit slices should be in an even, single layer and should not touch each other.


If using a dehydrator, place the fruit on a dehydrator tray instead of using a parchment-lined cooking sheet.
If rack drying outdoors, place the fruit on your drying rack instead of using a cooking sheet.

, Preheat the oven to its lowest setting (150-200 degrees F / 50 degrees C).You need only to dry the fruit, not to cook it. After the oven is fully preheated, place the cooking sheet of fruit inside.

, Depending on the type of fruit, the exact oven temperature, and the thickness of the slices, fruit can take anywhere from 4 to 8 hours to dry. Keep an eye on the fruit to make sure that it shrivels up without burning.


The drying process will take several hours by necessity; do not try to increase heat to speed up drying process, since doing so will burn the fruit and make it inedible.

, Fruit should be chewy, not crunchy or squishy.

,, Temperatures need to be at least 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius), if not hotter. Also note that outdoor drying takes several days, so you'll need a consistent heat spell.The humidity should also be below 60 percent while you dry, and the weather should be both sunny and breezy.

, Choose stainless steel, teflon coated fiberglass, or plastic. Keep the fruit in an even layer.Most wood trays also work, but avoid green wood, pine, cedar, oak, and redwood.
Also avoid using hardware cloth (galvanized metal cloth).

, Set the tray of fruit on two blocks to keep it off the ground. Cover loosely with cheesecloth, and let it sit out in direct sunlight.


It's important to keep the trays off moist ground. Setting them on blocks also improves air flow and speeds drying.
Consider placing a tin or aluminum sheet beneath the tray to reflect more sunlight and speed drying.
Covering the trays will protect them from birds and insects.
Move the trays under shelter at night since the cool evening air can introduce moisture back into the fruit.

, Drying fruit using this method will take several days. Monitor the progress several times each day until the fruit seems shriveled and chewy.

, If no such setting exists, set the temperature to 135 degrees Fahrenheit (57 degrees Celsius)., Spread the fruit over the dehydrator rack in a single layer. The exact amount of drying time will vary by fruit and thickness, but it will usually be ready after one or two days.


Begin checking the fruit after the first 24 hours to prevent it from over-drying. Afterward, check on it every 6 to 8 hours.

, When ready, the fruit should be shriveled and chewy. Squeeze it gently; it should be fairly rigid since the moisture has been drawn out of the squishy flesh.

, Stored in this manner, most dried fruits will last from 9 to 12 months. Packaged dried fruits should be consumed faster once opened, and may need to be stored in the refrigerator in a sealed bag, to prevent deterioration. This is especially so if the original dried fruits are still somewhat moist rather than completely dehydrated.

, Some dried fruits can be rehydrated by stewing or soaking in warm water. This is typically done for such dried fruits as apples, apricots, peaches, prunes and pears. Dried mangoes and pawpaw can be rehydrated by leaving in cold water for an hour before using. Other dried fruits can be revived by soaking in alcohol, such as sultanas, currants and raisins, before using in traditional recipes such as dried fruit cake or pudding.

Leave the gourds on the vines where they grow.,
Pick up a gourd and shake it.,
Gather the gourds from the field when they are fully dry.,
Compost any gourds that started to rot before fully drying.",How to Dry Gourds1," Mature gourds can handle frost and can even withstand a few cycles of freezing and thawing. As the plant turns brown and dies, the gourds dry and fall off.If the gourds have matured by the end of the growing season but have not had time to dry, you can leave them on the vine over winter. When the snow melts and exposes them in the spring, they will continue drying where they left off in the fall. However, there is a risk that they will rot if you leave them over winter.;
, Dried gourds are lightweight and hollow. Listen for the sound of seeds rattling around inside. Sometimes, however, the seeds stick to the inside of the gourd before drying and do not rattle. The seeds can be used for other uses as stock

, If they are still attached to the plant, you can cut the vine flush with the gourd or leave a piece of stem intact--leaving the gourd is purely ornamental when you dry the gourd on the vine.

, No matter how you choose to dry gourds, a small percentage of them will always rot--be prepared for this.

Plant varieties of garlic that are specially suited to drying and storage.,
Dig your garlic from your garden when the soil is dry.,
Dry garlic while the stalks, roots and leaves are still attached.,
Don’t wash the garlic plants after they are harvested.",How to Dry Garlic1," The best options are Creole and Silverskin. Some heirloom varieties will lose their rich flavor after drying.;
, Avoid watering for several days before you harvest. , The garlic that you buy at the store is already cured for several months of storage in a cool, dry place. However, you can use garlic cloves to make powder or minced garlic. , It will make them harder to dry and it may produce mold. Once you peel off several layers of dried skin, the dirt will no longer be an issue.

Cut the mature gourds off of the vines when the leaves and stem begin turning brown.,
Wash the gourds with warm soapy water.,
Rinse them with clear cold water after washing or soaking.,
Choose a spot outdoors where the gourds can sit and dry.,
Lay the gourds in a single layer on an elevated surface.,
Keep in mind that drying time varies.,
Remove any mould that grows.,
Rotate the gourds.",How to Dry Gourds2," Use sharp pruners to make a nice, even cut. Leave 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of stem attached to each gourd. Leaving this bit of stem is important because it helps with the evaporation of water. The skin of the gourd is hard and non-porous, so the porous stem is necessary to let moisture escape from the gourd.


If you have gourds that are considered immature (it is fleshy and bright green) and are concerned that the first frost will kill them, cut them from the vine and use them as temporary decorations. You generally will not be able to dry these gourds. You can also leave them on the vine--occasionally they will be hardened by the frost rather than killed., Doing this removes bacteria and helps prevent rotting.


You can also soak them for 20 minutes in a solution of one part household bleach and nine parts warm water.

, This will get rid of any residual soap or bleach.

, The gourds can dry in a cold location, but keep in mind that repetitive freezing and thawing can often damage the seeds inside the gourds. In turn, damage to the seeds will make it so that the seeds cannot be replanted.You can also dry gourds in a garage, barn or inside of the house, but they will get the best air circulation if you allow them to dry outside. It may take several months for the gourds to dry fully. Keep in mind that large quantities of drying gourds give off an unpleasant odor. If you dry them inside your home, it will take some time to get rid of the smell.

, The surface should be a structure like a wood pallet. Elevating the platform allows for increased air circulation--the air will be able to circulate around them from every direction.

, Depending on the size of the gourd, it could take from six weeks to a whole year to dry fully., Use the dull side of a butter knife to scrape the mould off. You can also wash mould off with a rag. If a gourd becomes soft, you will have to throw it out.

, Turn the gourds over once every 1 to 2 weeks to expose the bottom to air.

Wash fully ripe figs.,
Cut the figs in half.,
Lay them on a wire rack.,
Cover the figs with cheesecloth.,
Place the rack in full sunlight.,
Let them dry for 2 to 3 days.",How to Dry Figs1," The best indication that a fig is fully ripe is when it falls to the ground. Rinse the figs to remove dirt and other debris. Trim off bruises and broken parts. Pat them dry with a dishcloth or paper towel before proceeding.;
, Use a sharp paring knife to cut the figs in half from stem to tip. Cutting the figs in half will help them dry more quickly.

, You may use a drying rack intended for this purpose or purchase screening with plenty of ventilation holes. Line the rack with a layer of cheesecloth before setting the figs on top, cut side up.


Don't try to dry the figs on a solid sheet. In order to dry properly, they need airflow from below and above.
Use a double layer of cheesecloth if you have a rack with very large holes.

, This will protect them from insects as they dry. Tuck the cheesecloth tightly around the drying rack, securing it with tape if necessary, to make sure it won't come loose.

, This method works best when it is very dry and hot outside. Don't place the figs in the shade, or they won't dry as quickly and may spoil before they're properly preserved.

, Each evening, take them inside - unless the temperature where you live does not drop more than 20 degrees at night. In the mornings, turn the figs over, so they dry evenly on all sides. The figs are ready when when the outside feels leathery and no juice can be seen on the inside when squeezed.


If the figs remain a little sticky, you can finish them in the oven.
Store the dried figs in a cool, dry place or freeze them to make them last even longer.

Dig up garlic plants when they have reached maturity.

,
Choose a place to cure the garlic that is cool, shaded and well ventilated.,
Lay the garlic plants out in a single layer.,
Wait 1 to 2 months for the garlic to cure.,
Cut the roots off 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) from the base of the garlic bulb.,
Snip the stalk off 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top of the clove.,
Place garlic bulbs in a cool, dry place away, such as a cupboard.",How to Dry Garlic2,", It should be over 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius). Outdoor shaded spots work best because there is flowing air that will decrease curing time.

, You can also braid them together while the necks are still soft or hang them from a line.

, The leaves should be brown and papery, while the roots should be stiff and shriveled.

,, Peel off the leaves. Don’t peel too far down to the bulb or you will expose the clove and need to use the garlic right away., Keep the temperature between 55 and 65 degrees Fahrenheit (13 and 18 degrees Celsius). Never place the garlic in the sun.


If your conditions are more humid than 65 percent, you may want to dry the garlic using the next method and freeze it. Garlic that is too humid will mold.
You can also store the garlic in mesh bags or pantyhose, as long as the environment is shaded and dry.

Choose your storage method.,
Finished.

",How to Dry Garlic3," Avoid using bruised cloves.

, Discard the papery skin.

, If you prefer sliced garlic, cut it by hand with a sharp knife.

, You will want to make sure your oven can be set at a low temperature below 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius).

, You can set it at the optimal 115 degrees Fahrenheit (45 degrees Celsius). Use larger slices of garlic if your dehydrator has holes in the racks.

, The higher the temperature, the less time it will take. However, to avoid chewiness, you should dry garlic at 115 degrees over 2 days.

, There are several ways that you can successfully store dried garlic.


Freeze the slices or pieces in an airtight container. They will last for 1 year. Grind the pieces in an old coffee grinder before you use them.
Store pieces of dried garlic in an airtight container in your kitchen. You can keep dried garlic at room temperature for several months, as long as it is out of direct sunlight and high heat.
Grind the garlic pieces immediately after they have cooled. Use your old coffee grinder. Then, strain through a fine mesh sieve to separate the powder from the small pieces. Store them for 2 months for use in recipes that call for garlic powder. ,"

Wait at least 10 to 12 hours for the apricots to dry.",How to Dry Apricots1," If they grow locally in your area, wait for the end of the season “canning specials” when you can get ripe fruit that you can use immediately, instead of keeping it around to eat raw.;
, They will be ripe in late summer, or sometime between July and September, depending upon the year.

, If you are worried your apricots will become overripe before you have time to dry them, you can place them in the refrigerator for up to a week. , Soak them for a few minutes in water to loosen dirt and then rinse them with running water. Discard any bruised apricots.

, You should cut them in half along the indentation, and then you can remove the pit.

, Push the outside center up, so that there is more flesh exposed to the air. You will dry them with the flesh facing up.

, If you have a large wire rack, place it above the rack to reduce drying times., Make sure they are spaced evenly apart.

, They will dry best at a warming temperature below 200 degrees (93 degrees Celsius). 175 degrees Fahrenheit (79 degrees Celsius) will work well for drying apricots.

, Place the cooking sheets with racks in the oven.

, Turn them at the halfway mark to ensure even drying. They should be slightly soft but leathery when they are done.


The cooking time will vary depending upon the size of the apricots and the temperature at which you dry them. It will take less time to dry at 175 than 150 degrees.

Know the pros and cons of greenscaping.,
Let the gourds dry after they have been harvested.,
Use a dull kitchen butter knife to gently scrape away the outer layer of the skin.,
Finish drying the greenscaped gourds.",How to Dry Gourds4," Greenscaping is a controversial process. Some growers recommend it to speed the drying process and decrease the chance of dark mold staining. Other growers say greenscaping, or doing anything to the surface of the gourd before it is fully dry, increases the risk of damage and infection., Only dry them for a few weeks (they will only become slightly dried.)

, Doing this will reveal lighter layer below.

, Place the gourds in a warm, well-ventilated, and light area. Turn them every 2 to 3 days if you are drying them on a flat surface.


Know that if the gourds dry too quickly they will most likely wrinkle.

Clean the gourd after it has dried completely.,
Use the dull side of a table knife to scrape the outer skin off.,
Fill any small holes or cracks with wood putty.",How to Dry Gourds5," Submerge the gourds in a bucket of warm, soapy water. This helps to loosen the skin and mold that may have developed on the outer surface.


You can add bleach to the water to give the gourds a uniform color but this is not necessary.

, During the drying process, the outer skin may become wrinkled or stained. In general, you will want to scrape it off.You can also use steel wool or sandpaper to remove the outer layer of skin. However, using either of these tools will result in scratch marks. Only use sandpaper or steel wool if you plan on painting the gourd.


, While this is not necessary, it will give the surface of your gourd a uniform texture. You can also sand the inside of the gourd so that it is smooth.

Place them in the oven.,
Allow the figs to stay in the oven for up 8 to 24 hours.",How to Dry Figs2," It's necessary to dry the figs at a low, even temperature. Drying them at a higher temperature would result in cooked figs.


If your oven doesn't heat to such a low temperature, set it at the lowest possible temperature and keep the oven door partially open.
You may also use a food dehydrator to dry figs.

, Carefully trim away any damaged parts and pat them dry with a paper towel or dishcloth.

, Use a sharp paring knife to slice them from stem to tip, lengthwise.

, Be sure to use a rack with ventilation holes, so that the figs dry from below and above. Using a regular baking pan will result in figs that don't dry evenly.

, Prop the oven door open slightly to allow the moisture to escape and prevent the figs from getting too hot and cooking instead of drying.


Turn the figs occasionally during the drying process.
If you don't want to leave the oven on continuously, you can turn it off halfway through, then turn it back on if necessary.

, The figs are dry when the outsides are leathery and no juice can be seen on the inside when you split one open.

, Have you had allergic reactions to artificial sweeteners? If so, and you also want to avoid sugar, so you must decide: How bad is your reaction to artificial sweeteners, compared to wanting to avoid cavities, etc. You may decide to avoid gum altogether.

, If you have a history of smoking, and want to stop, you might want to try a type of nicotine gum. This can help you in quitting smoking.

, If you wear dentures or braces, and regular gum sticks to them, consider trying gum specially made for them, as they are less sticky.

, Sugarless gum isn't for you then, instead go for gum with sugar, but limit your chewing and brush after chewing.

Cut the meat into � inch strips.,
Combine the meat with the soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper and garlic in a large bowl.

,
Cover with plastic wrap if the bowl does not come with a cover and marinate the meat in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 hours to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.

,
Place the meat and marinade into a saucepan, turn the stove burner on high and bring to a boil.

,
Boil for 3 to 5 minutes to sanitize the meat before dehydrating.

,
Remove the strips of meat with a pair of tongs and let them drain on paper towels.

Invest in a vertical dehydrator if you are only drying a few or one type of food.,
Use a horizontal dehydrator if you are drying large quantities or many different foods.,
Choose a food dehydrator with a fan if you are making bark or fruit leather.,
Buy a dehydrator with adjustable temperature settings.,
Purchase the right trays and accessories depending on the foods you're drying.,
Cut your meat into smaller slices.,
Place your strips of meat onto a tray and place it inside the dehydrator.,
Dry the meat at 145–155 °F (63–68 °C) for about 6 hours.,
Dab ham and beef slices with paper towels frequently throughout the drying process.,
Take the meat out of the dehydrator once it is completely dry.,
Store your dehydrated meats in airtight plastic bags.,
Check your dried meats every couple of weeks or so.,
Wash and dry your fruits and vegetables.,
Blanch all vegetables except onions, peppers, and mushrooms.,
Slice your fruits and vegetables into even slices.,
Lay your sliced fruits or vegetables onto the tray in a single, even layer.,
Dry the larger fruits or vegetables at 130–135 °F (54–57 °C) for 6-12 hours.,
Check for specific textures as you dry your fruits or vegetables.,
Store dried fruits similarly to how you would store meats.",How to Dehydrate Foods," Vertical dehydrators have heat travel from top to bottom or vice versa. They tend to be smaller but are also cheaper.


Vertical dehydrators with a fan on the bottom provide the best heat distribution and are more efficient because hot air rises.However, the drippings from fruits, vegetables, and meats can drip into the fan and become difficult to clean. It can also cause the dehydrator to malfunction or fail.
Having a fan on top eliminates this problem but tends to dry foods on the top more quickly than those on the bottom. This may not always be a problem, since certain foods have different drying times. For example, beef can be placed in the top tray (less water content) and apples on the bottom (more water content).The main disadvantage here is that the foods dried together vertically can adopt each other's tastes.
American Harvest/Nesco Food Dehydrators offer a variety of top-fan/bottom-fan dehydrators at a wide range of affordable prices.;
, This model of dehydrator tends to be large, allowing multiple foods to be dried at once. It also provides the most even heat distribution.


Horizontal dehydrators have the fan or the principal drying element in the back of the unit. Since the air doesn't pass directly from one tray to the next, this minimizes the imparting of flavors between foods.This means your beef jerky won't taste like your apple chips, and vice versa.
The main disadvantage is that horizontal dehydrators are more expensive.
Excalibur Dehydrators are well built and a very popular brand among drying enthusiasts., Some dehydrators use other heating mechanisms to dry food, which often takes longer and yields poor results in fruits.


Using a dehydrator without a fan can cause banana slices to dry unevenly, sometimes making it feel moist and other times making it feel like poker chips.As a result, drying fruit becomes an unpredictable and inefficient process.

, Different foods require different temperatures; one temperature fits all is not a good strategy for drying food.Look for a range of 95–155 °F (35–68 °C). Meat is typically dried in the 145–155 °F (63–68 °C) range, while fruits and vegetables hover around the 125–135 °F (52–57 °C) range.
Temperature is very important when it comes to dehydrating food. Too low a temperature can cause food to spoil while too high a temperature can cause the surface of the food to harden, preventing moisture from escaping.Know that lower priced dehydrators, while frugal, also may not offer different temperature settings.

, Tray size isn't the only feature to consider when drying foods of different sizes, textures, and water content.


Tray size isn't that great of a factor unless you are seeking to dry large quantities of food. Otherwise, your food should dry at a predictable and consistent rate, provided you have purchased a quality dehydrator.
Mesh sheets are necessary for drying small vegetables like peas and corn. They are pliable, making it easier to pop off fruits like bananas, which tend to stick to plastic when dried.These sheets are also necessary for certain tray structures intended for meats. Meat trays will have gaps where slices of fruit will fall through without mesh sheets.
For blended foods like mashed potatoes, tomato sauce, and fruit purees, buy non-stick sheets or fruit leather trays. Non-stick sheets are reusable and work better than parchment paper. Never use wax paper as it will melt in the dehydrator.
Stacked trays are a feature of certain dehydrators and make it difficult to check the food you are drying. Sliding trays allow you to slide a tray out rather than removing it completely, making the monitoring process much easier.

, Be sure your slices are uniformly cut so that dehydration occurs consistently throughout your meat.


Slice ham into 1-inch wide strips. They should look like slightly thicker slices of bacon.Cut beef into long, 1/4-inch wide strips if you are making beef jerky.Pull chicken apart into small pieces. It should look very similar to pulled pork.
If you plan on consuming meats after they have been dried, be sure that your ham and chicken are precooked. Raw, dehydrated beef is okay to consume as it will turn into beef jerky. Eating raw dehydrated pork can cause an infection called trichinosis, which occurs when raw or under-cooked pork is consumed.Similarly, eating raw chicken can give you salmonella food poisoning.

, Position slices into neat rows so that they do not overlap or cover one another. Spread the pulled chicken into an even layer so that there are no large clumps.

, These times and temperatures may vary slightly for different meats but should yield an overall similar result.If making beef jerky, monitor your slices to make sure they are pliable but not brittle. This means they should bend without actually breaking.

, The moisture that comes to the surface will mostly be oil and fat from the meat.


Oils and fats don't evaporate as easily as smaller molecules like water.Therefore, you need to wipe it away in order for drying to be successful.
You don't have to wipe the pulled chicken bits as chicken is leaner and contains less fat.

, Use your fingers to test the meat and see if there is still moisture on the surface.


Drying requires a lot of monitoring and is not a precise procedure like baking, for instance. Don't be afraid of opening up the dehydrator to check the meat every few hours to observe its progress.

, Remember, air also contains moisture, and moisture is the enemy of dried foods.If you're storing the meat shorter than a month, store it in a dry, dark place at room temperature. Your kitchen cupboard should be ideal for dried meats. Don't worry about spoilage; removing the water content prevents meats from spoiling.
For long term storage, place meat in the freezer or refrigerator.

, Even though water has been pulled from the meat, air may still find a way of getting in. Since air tends to carry bacteria and other organisms, sealed meats can still become moldy or spoiled.


When storing dried foods, contamination from insects can occur. Don't worry, however, since this is not common among properly sealed meats. It is most likely a result of meats already containing the eggs prior to drying.To reduce insect contamination, pasteurize your meat after drying it. You can either store the meat in the refrigerator for 48 hours or place it in the oven at 175 °F (79 °C) for 15-30 minutes.Dried foods can be stored up to one year. Vacuum-packing and refrigerating can double or triple this shelf-life., Even though most of the germs will be killed during the drying process, you want to reduce the amount of bacteria as much as you can beforehand.

, Blanching will help preserve the taste and texture of crunchier vegetables.

, Be sure to peel and core fruits like peaches, apricots, apples, pineapples, and pears before dehydrating.


For corn, cut the actual corn off of the cob instead drying the entire vegetable.
Remove the seeds from peppers after you have sliced them.
You can leave mushrooms whole if you wish.

, If you are drying many different fruits/vegetables at a time, designate one tray for each kind.


Try to limit how many fruits and vegetables you dry at a time. Even if you are using a horizontal dehydrator, having too many items can throw off drying times.

, For smaller vegetables like corn, broccoli, mushrooms, and peas, drying for 3-10 hours will be sufficient.These times vary from plant to plant and depends largely on the water content of the food. Most fruits dry at the same temperature and for the same amount of time, but some vegetables have drastically different drying times.
The most different drying times belong to corn, broccoli, mushrooms, and peas. Since these vegetables are small and contain less water, they tend to dry in half the time of other vegetables.

, Dryness textures will vary from plant to plant, so be sure to read these specific textures for each fruit and vegetable.


Green beans, carrots, corn, peas, mushrooms, and zucchini should all feel brittle.
Beets, peppers, blueberries, cherries, pears, and pineapples should all feel leathery.
Onions, potatoes, and tomatoes should feel crisp. Bananas and strawberries should feel almost crisp.
Apples, apricots, peaches, and strawberries should all feel pliable.
Broccoli and cauliflower will simply feel dry and hard.

, For periods shorter than one month, store in vacuum sealed containers in dry, dark areas. For periods longer than that, store in refrigerators and freezers.


Keep fruits and vegetables high in Vitamin A away from direct light. Vitamin A is sensitive to light and is retained during the drying process. Fruits containing vitamin A - like carrots, bell peppers, and mangoes - can degrade in direct sunlight.For the best quality, fruits and vegetables should be replaced every year."

Inspect the outer skin.,
Apply light pressure to the kiwi.,
Smell the kiwi.",How to Choose Kiwis1," Inspect the outer skin’s color and texture. A ripe kiwi’s skin is brown and fuzzy. Also, check for any bruises, dark spots, mold, or wrinkles. If the kiwi is bruised, shriveled, or has mold, then the kiwi is not good for eating and is probably overripe., Hold the kiwi between your thumb and four fingers. Apply light pressure with your thumb. If the kiwi slightly gives, then it is perfectly ripe; it should feel soft, but not too soft. On the other hand, if the kiwi gives too much when you apply pressure, it’s probably mushy and overripe., Also smell the kiwi for readiness. If the kiwi gives off a fragrant, citrus smell, then it is perfectly ripe and ready to eat. However, if the kiwi gives off a pungent, sweet smell then it is most likely overripe.

You don’t want damaged fruit that will ripen unevenly., Hold the kiwi between your thumb and four fingers. Apply pressure with your thumb. If the kiwi is firm and does not give to pressure, then it is unripe. You can then ripen your kiwis at home., Ripen your kiwis at home by placing them in a paper bag with another fruit, such as a banana.The kiwis also need to be at room temperature to become ripe.

See how the tea is packaged and stored.,
Smell the tea.,
Notice the tea's appearance.,
Do a taste test.",How to Choose Pu Erh Tea," Pu-erh should generally be stored and aged in a dark, cool, dry area, away from other aromas, where it has access to some airflow. It is usually stored in its original paper wrapping. Tea shops that have elaborate or airtight, sealed packaging for Pu-erh cakes often are not offering the best Pu-erh for the best deals and are often not storing it properly.;
, Good pu-erh tea should smell clear and distinctly ""tea-ish"". Depending on the age, you may detect smoky or woody aromas. The tea should not have odd odours, and it should not smell moldy. Tea absorbs smell rather easily; thus, if improperly kept, the tea can pick up funny smells from anything: cooking smells, spices, etc.

, Very ancient green pu-erh tea cakes should look reddish. Newer pu-erhs will be more yellow-to-greenish, but they will never look pure black. The tea cake should not have white/yellow dots which might be mold or yeast forming. When buying expensive tea cakes, it's generally preferred for the cakes to be whole, without large cracks. Sometimes, people might sample expensive tea cakes by using a knife to scrape the centre of the depression behind the tea cake, flaking a few leaves off. This is seldom noticed, but be aware that you've lost a bit of tea if your cake has been sampled.

, This can only come with experience and more exposure to pu-erh tea. Purchasing samples from pu-erh tea museums can allow one to taste teas of different ages, enabling people to distinguish what's good.

Prioritize pasture raised pork.,
Opt for thicker cuts to prevent dryness.,
Ensure marbling by checking the meat.,
Choose pink chops that are well packaged.",How to Choose Pork Chops1," This feature should be clearly indicated on the label of potential pork chops, but in the event it is not, simply inquire with your butcher which pork chops are pasture raised. These cuts will be available at most butchers and groceries.


In some cases, pasture raised pork can be a little more expensive than other varieties. If you're on a budget, you might want to avoid this kind of meat.
Pasture raised pork generally has a better consistency, taste, and quality than ""farm raised"" pork, which usually refers to pigs raised and processed in an industrial style of butchery.;
, Much of the pork available today is raised to be as lean as possible, which can cause your meat to become easily overcooked. Thicker pork chops will retain moisture better, so you might want to ask for a double-cut for your chops, or specify you want yours at least 1½ inches (3.8 cm) thick.


Bone-in cuts also help prevent the loss of moisture when cooking. If you find you have a problem with dryness in your chops, bone-in cuts may help with the problem., At most butchers, you'll have the option to look over the meat you plan on buying to inspect its quality. The most important feature for you to look for at this point is called ""marbling,"" which is the presence of veins of white fat in the meat.


Ideal pork chops will have a small amount of marbling throughout the chop and no yellow fat.
Fat not only helps retain moisture in your meat, it also enriches the flavor of it. If you dislike fatty meat, you can always cut the fat out after it has been cooked., The meat of your chops should be light pink in color. They should be wrapped in clean packaging that has no holes or tears. The packaging itself should have little to no leakage, and the tray in which the meat is presented should also have little to no fluid.If you notice discoloration, like a graying or browning in your pork chops, your meat has already started to spoil.
Smell is a great indicator of freshness. If you notice a sour, unpleasant, rotten, or decaying odor, your chops have spoiled and should be thrown away.
Check the sell-by date on the packaging of your pork chops. If your meat has passed this date, it may be safest to throw the meat away.

Choose ripe Meyer lemons.,
Sterilize your canning jar.,
Scrub the lemons' skins.,
Slice off the stems.,
Slice the lemons lengthwise, leaving the bases attached.,
Make a perpendicular lengthwise slice.,
Place two tablespoons of salt in the bottom of the jar.,
Sprinkle salt inside a quartered lemon.,
Place the lemon into the jar cut-side down.,
Add two more tablespoons of salt to the jar.,
Layer another lemon on top of the first.,
Keep layering salt and lemons until you get close to the top.,
Add extra juice if necessary.,
Lid the jar and store the lemons in the refrigerator.,
Cut off a lemon quarter and rinse it well.,
Puree an entire preserved lemon with the salt.,
Use it to add flavor to chicken and fish dishes.",How to Preserve Lemons," Meyer lemons are darker in color and sweeter than conventional lemons. Their peak season begins in November and ends in March, making winter a great time to make preserved lemons. Meyer lemons are traditionally used in place of conventional lemons in this recipe because their thinner skin makes them easier to preserve properly.Look for lemons with firm, bright flesh. Don't buy lemons that are green and underripe, and avoid lemons with brown spots indicating they're past their prime.
If you can't find Meyer lemons, you can preserve conventional lemons instead. It's still best to use lemons when they're in season, during the winter months, since the lemons will taste fresher.;
, You can use a mason jar or another canning jar of any size. A quart-size jar fits enough lemons to last for a year or more, provided you don't need them for every recipe you make. It's important to make sure the jar is sterile before you put the lemons inside; otherwise, you might end up with rotten preserves. Here's how to sterilize a jar:Boil a large pot of water
Lower the jar into the water and boil it for five minutes
Boil the lid separately
Lay the jar and lid out to dry on a clean towel

, Since you're preserving the entire lemon, peel and all, it's important to scrub the skin to make sure all traces of pesticides and other residue are washed away. Run cold water over the lemons and use a vegetable brush to scrub the skins well. Dry the lemons once you're finished.

, Use a sharp paring knife to slice the brown stems or stem tips from the ends of the lemons. The stems are inedible, so you want to remove them before you preserve the lemons.

, Stand a lemon on one end and hold it steady with one hand. With the other hand, use a paring knife to slice the lemon in half lengthwise. Slice through the lemon, but leave the base of the lemon intact; you want the pieces to stay together., Turn the lemon ninety degrees and slice again, so that you make an ""x"" shape across the top of the lemon and into the flesh. Again, don't slice all the way through the lemon; leave the base intact. Repeat with the remaining lemons.

, This should be enough to completely cover the bottom. Kosher salt is the best kind to use, since it has a clean, sea-salty taste that will complement the lemons. , Gently open the lemon and sprinkle it between the slices, still leaving the base intact. Use up to a tablespoon of salt to completely coat the inside of the lemon.

, Push it against the salt at the bottom of the jar. This will release the lemon juice and help the preservation process get started.

, This should be enough to almost completely cover the top of the lemon. Simply sprinkle it over the the lemon you just placed in the jar.

, Put it into the jar cut-side down, and push it against the salty lemon below. Keep pushing until the juices are released.

, Add another layer of salt, another lemon, and so on until you have only an inch of space left at the top of the jar. If you're using a quart-sized jar, there's probably enough space for three or four lemons, depending on their size.


Top it off with more salt. This will ensure the top of the last lemon gets completely preserved.
It's important to leave extra space, called ""headspace,"" at the top of the jar. This keeps pressure from building up in the jar.

, Squeezing the lemons into the jar should produce enough juice to rise about halfway up the jar. If the jar is low on lemon juice, cut into another lemon and squeeze the juice into the jar. You want it to rise at least halfway to the top of the jar.


You can also top off the liquid with water that has been boiled and cooled.
If you want sweet preserved lemons, add maple syrup to top it off.

, Lemons preserved with salt and their own juice will last up to a year when stored in the refrigerator. Just remember to keep the lid tightly fastened.

, If you want to add something tart to your meal, a simple preserved lemon quarter will do just the trick. Remove the lemon quarter from the jar and rinse it under cold running water to remove excess salt.


If you wish, use a sharp knife to slice the lemon quarter into very thin slices.
A little goes a long way, and one lemon quarter will provide enough lemon to divide among three or four serving plates.

, Pureed preserved lemon is excellent when mixed into sauces. Remove a lemon and place it in your food processor. Puree the lemon until you have a fine, grainy paste. Store the paste in a small jar, and spoon a little into the sauce or dressing of your choice.


Pureed preserved lemon is excellent in marinades.
Or use it to add some punch to your favorite salad dressing.

, Preserved lemons are typically paired with spicy meat and fish dishes. The extra tart flavor from the lemons makes a regular dish taste extraordinary. Try using preserved lemons in the following ways:


Place two preserved lemon slices on top of a fish filet before grilling or baking.
Make a rub for grilled chicken using preserved 1 tablespoon lemon puree mixed with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add pepper to taste.
Serve any grilled meat dish with a few thin slices of preserved lemon on the side.

Choose ripe, flavourful fruit.,
Process the fruit according to a recipe.,
Prepare your canning equipment.,
Sanitize the canning jars.,
Prepare the water bath canner.,
Fill the jars with prepared fruit.,
Place the jars in the canner or pot.,
Bring the water to a rolling boil and begin timing the processing.,
Use the jar lifter to remove the jars from the canner or pot.,
Check the lids before storing.",How to Preserve Fruit1," No matter what type of fruit you're canning, the flavor and texture will hold up best over time if you use fruit that's perfectly ripe. Discard fruit that's overripe and bruised, and leave out fruit that's not quite ripe yet., Since each type of fruit has different properties, it's a good idea to follow a canning recipe designed just for the fruit you're preserving. For example, if you want to can applies, you might decide to process them as applesauce first. For peaches, you may want to peel and slice them before canning. Here is a list of techniques used to process different types of fruits for canning:


Can sliced apples
Can applesauce
Can sliced peaches
Can sliced pears

Can berry jam; this works for any type of berry

Can stonefruit jam; this works for apricots, plums and peaches

, Fruit contains a lot of acid, which acts as a natural preservative and helps the fruit keep for a long time after canning. The canning method that works best for fruit is called water bath canning. This involves placing the fruit in sanitized jars and heating the jars to a certain temperature to kill off any bacteria. Once the jars are sealed, the canned fruit lasts many months. Here's what you'll need:


Boiling water bath canner or a large, deep saucepot with a lid and a rack to keep the jars from touching the bottom
Glass canning jars with new lids and bands
Jar lifter

, Run them through the dishwasher or wash each one with hot, soapy water, making sure to rinse them thoroughly when you're finished. Keep the jars hot until you use them by leaving them in the dishwasher or placing them in a pot filled with water that's hot, but not boiling.


Keeping the jars hot until you use them prevents jars from breaking when you pour hot fruit inside. If you poured hot fruit into a cold jar, the glass could break.

, Fill the canner half-full with water and bring it to a simmer. If you're using a pot instead of a canner, place the rack inside the pot, then fill it halfway with water and bring it to a simmer.


If you don't have a rack designed for home canning, you can use a cake cooling rack, or even make a rack by tying jar bands together with string and placing them on the bottom of the pot.
It's essential to use a rack of some kind to prevent the jar from touching the bottom of the pot, which could cause it to overheat.

, One at a time, take a jar from the dishwasher or pot where you're keeping it warm. Set it on your workspace. Use a ladle or funnel to fill the jar with the fruit from the recipe you prepared. Use a wet cloth to wipe off any residue that gets on the rim of the jar, then place a lid on the jar and secure it with a band.


If you're canning a soft spread, like a berry or plum jam, leave 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) of headspace at the top of the jar.
If you're canning whole or sliced fruit, leave 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of headspace at the top of the jar.

, Lower them onto the rack until the canner or pot has reached maximum capacity. The water should rise above the tops of the jars by at least one inch. Put the lid on the canner or pot, and make sure it's securely in place.

, The canning recipe you're using will provide the correct amount of time you should boil the jars to adequately heat the fruit. The higher your altitude, the longer the amount of processing time. Check the recipe you're using and add time accordingly:


If your altitude is between 1,001 and 3,000 feet (0.0 m), add 5 minutes
If your altitude is between 3,001 and 6,000 feet (0.0 m), add 10 minutes
If your altitude is between 6,001 and 8,000 feet (0.0 m), add 15 minutes
If your altitude is between 8,001 and 10,000 feet (0.0 m), add 20 minutes

, Set them on a towel and allow them to cool completely. Leave them undisturbed for 12 to 24 hour hours to give the lids time to fully seal.

, If the jars were properly processed, the lids will have flexed inward instead of staying popped out. If you see lids that are popped out, they were improperly sealed, so you'll need to store the jar in the refrigerator and eat the fruit within a week. Jars that are properly sealed should be stored in a cool, dark place."

Select a shoulder chop for rich flavor.,
Purchase rib chops for lean meat and mild flavor.,
Choose loin chops if you have time for careful cooking.,
Opt for boneless chops for picky eaters.,
Save sirloin chops for slow cooking situations.",How to Choose Pork Chops2," Shoulder cuts have rich, dark meat that packs a lot of flavor. Because this cut is naturally high in fat, it's perfect for braising. However, you can also pan cook it regularly, so long as you tenderize it first.


Due to the fact that this cut is rich in fat and other connective tissue, moist, high heat works best when cooking.
You may be more familiar with the shoulder cut by one of its other names: the blade chop, blade-end pork loin chop, or pork steak., The rib chop comes with a large eye of loin meat, but lacks tenderloin meat. There will be a bone running along one side of this cut that is often covered in a thin layer of fat. This cut will be relatively lean and have a mild flavor.Since rib chops are a leaner cut, quick cook methods work well to seal in moisture in the meat. These include grilling, broiling, sear-roasting, and more.
You'll find that rib chops are among the more tender cuts of pork chop you can buy. If tenderness is your preference, rib chops should be near the top of your list.

, Loin chops require a little more babysitting than other varieties. A t-bone will divide the loin meat from the tenderloin meat, and since these meats cook at different rates, you'll have to keep a close eye on them while cooking. The meat will be lean and have a mild flavor of pork.


This cut of meat, also being on the lean side, will benefit from quick cooking methods like grilling, broiling, sear-roasting.
If you purchase top loin chops, these cuts will not have tenderloin meat included., Some people dislike meat served with a bone. Additionally, younger children might struggle with cutting around bone-in cuts. In these cases, a boneless pork chop will work perfectly. Expect the meat to be lean, and the flavor to be mild.


Boneless pork chop cuts are also known by as an America's cut or a pork loin fillet.
These cuts will have very little marbling, fat, and connective tissue, which means there will be a greater risk of overcooking. For this cut, you should consider brining your pork chop., This cut will have pieces of hip and backbone in it. The meat of this cut is comprised of many different muscle groups. It has a very strong pork flavor and, as the meat can be tough, it should be slow cooked to encourage tenderness.


Slow, moist heat will best break down the tissues in a sirloin chop, softening the tough meat into a delicious meal. Keep this cut in mind for braises and stews."

Identify lean pork chops for brining.,
Make a brine for your pork chops.,
Put your brine in a sealable plastic baggie.,
Insert the chop into your baggie and refrigerate it.,
Remove your chops and pat-dry the excess brine.,
Cook your pork chops and enjoy.",How to Choose Pork Chops3," Brining your pork chops will help your meat retain moisture after being cooked. This is especially important for lean chops that don't have much fat marbling the meat, as these will dry out more easily during cooking.


Marbling is a butcher's term that refers to the visible presence of fat, which often appears as white veins in the meat.
Even meat with good marbling can be made juicier by brining. If you like your meat to be juicy, you might want to consider brining your chops from now on., In a small or medium sized saucepan, mix together 2 cups of water, 1/3 cup of kosher salt, and 1/3 cup brown/granulated sugar over medium heat. Add to the mixture 1 teaspoon of black peppercorns, 2 sprigs of thyme, and 4 cloves of garlic. Stir the mixture with a spoon until the salt and sugar have dissolved.


You'll have to let your brine cool first before using it. You can speed up with process by adding some ice cubes to your cooling brine.
This recipe makes enough brine for 2 pork chops. You can adjust the ingredients proportions if you're making fewer or more than 2 pork chops., You'll want your plastic baggie to be large enough to accommodate your pork chop, but not so large that the brine settles to the bottom of the baggie and does not completely submerge the chop. You may find it easiest to split your brine equally between 2 medium sized baggies, one for each chop.


You should prioritize plastic baggies with a heavy duty seal. Some cheaper baggies may spring a leak and get brine all over your refrigerator., Put your chop into the baggie with your brine and seal it closed. For best results, you'll want your chop to sit in the brine at least 8 hours, so you may want to leave it in your refrigerator overnight.


Even if you don't have a full 8 hours to brine your chops, as few as 2 hours of brining can improve the juiciness of your meat.
Generally, you should not brine meat for more than 12 hours. Doing so will have no noticeable impact on the meat., You may want to remove the meat from its baggie with a tool, like a pair of tongs, but you should be able to guide your chop out by holding the corners opposite the mouth of the baggie and letting gravity pull the chop free. Excess brine that remains on the chop can be patted dry with clean paper towel.


Generally, before cooking your pork chops but after you remove excess brine, you should allow your chops to return to room temperature. This will help preserve the quality of the meat., Now that your pork chops are well brined and at room temperature, they're ready to be cooked in whatever fashion you desire. Some options you might consider for cooking your prepared pork chop include pan frying a breaded cutlet, grilling it, or braising it.

Refrigerate your food.,
Place most food in airtight containers.,
Organize your refrigerator.,
Freeze foods for longer term storage.,
Package your food properly for freezing.",How to Preserve Food1," Keeping food cold prevents many bacteria from forming. This is the method that we are all familiar with and have used. Refrigeration is good for food that you will be eating fairly soon -- typically within 3-5 days for meats, fruits, and vegetables, a week or so for dairy products, and months for condiments. If you have questions about whether the food is still good, err on the side of caution and do not eat. If you want a more specific set of times for how long food can last in the refrigerator, download the food safety app from the U.S. government’s Food and Drug Administration below., This applies specifically to leftovers and other foods that haven’t been packaged at the store. This way it will maintain its freshness in the refrigerator. Keep meats in the packages they came in from the store until you use them.Do not store fruits with vegetables -- fruits can give off high levels of ethylene, which causes fruit and vegetables to ripen. Stone fruits (peaches, plums, avocados, etc.) should be allowed to ripen on the counter, but berries and citrus should be refrigerated.
For vegetables, remove any ties or rubber bands before refrigerating. Pack vegetables loosely in the refrigerator -- it’s best not to let them touch., The top of the fridge has the most consistent temperature and is best suited for leftovers and other items that do not need to be cooked. The door is the warmest part of the refrigerator, and best for drinks and condiments. Fruits and vegetables are best in the crisper drawers in the bottom, where you can separate fruits from vegetables and keep them both cold and moist. The bottom shelves are the coldest and work best for raw meat and eggs., Don’t pack your freezer tight with food -- you need to let the cold air circulate between all of the items in your freezer to work properly. Freezing foods can allow them to last significantly longer, sometimes from six months to a year.

, Even though it’s tempting to toss food into freezer bags, vacuum packing is by far the better option. If you don’t have a vacuum sealer, try to at least get as much air out of the bags as you can before sealing. Label everything in your freezer with the contents and date with a marker and freezer-friendly masking tape (it will be specially marked).Do not freeze glass containers.
Do not fill containers to the top with leftovers before freezing (it will expand).
Do not put hot food into the freezer -- let it cool first so the freezer doesn’t have to do so much work and bring up the temperature of the entire appliance.
Do not thaw and re-freeze food. It will start to degrade quickly.

Choose ripe, flavorful fruit.,
Remove the peels, seeds and pits if necessary.,
Cut the fruit into chunks or slices.,
Lay out the fruit on a baking sheet.,
Freeze the tray of fruit for one hour.,
Place the fruit in freezer bags and store them in the freezer.",How to Preserve Fruit2," No matter what type of fruit you're freezing, the flavor and texture will hold up best over time if you use fruit that's perfectly ripe. Discard fruit that's overripe and bruised, and leave out fruit that's not quite ripe yet.

, If you're freezing fruit that has a peel or skin, like apples, peaches, plums or pears, it's best to remove the peel before freezing. If you leave the peels on they'll toughen in the freezer, and once thawed they won't have an appetizing texture. The pits and seeds should also be discarded.To peel apples, pears and other fruits with a tough peel, use a vegetable peeler or slice off the peel with a paring knife. Remove the seeds using an apple corer or by slicing out the core with a knife.
To peel peaches, plums, nectarines and other fruits with a thin skin, use the following process: slice an ""x"" in the skin at the top of the fruit. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Boil the fruit for 30 seconds, then remove it from the pot and place it in a bowl of ice to cool down. Once cool enough to handle, pull off the peel with your fingers. Remove the pit by slicing the fruit in half and prying it out.

, Use a paring knife to cut the fruit into equal-sized slices for easier storage. Fruit frozen whole may freeze unevenly or get freezer burn, so it's better to cut the fruit first.


Small fruits are the exception; there's no need to cut blueberries, raspberries, grapes or small strawberries before freezing.

, Place it on the sheet in one even layer, so that no fruit is overlapping. This will prevent the fruit from sticking together once frozen.

, It's ready to remove from the freezer when the fruit is slightly frosty; it needn't be frozen solid.

, Scoop all of the partially frozen fruit in a bag or bin that's freezer safe. Label the bag and store it in the freezer until you're ready to use it.


Labeling the bags will help you remember what type of fruit is inside.
Most frozen fruit will keep for six to nine months.

Store the dried fruit.",How to Preserve Fruit3," No matter what type of fruit you're drying, the flavor and texture will hold up best over time if you use fruit that's perfectly ripe. Discard fruit that's overripe and bruised, and leave out fruit that's not quite ripe yet.

, Dried fruit usually still has its peel or skin intact, but you can remove these if you don't like them. Regardless of what you do with the peel and skin, pits and seeds should be removed.


To peel apples, pears and other fruits with a tough peel, use a vegetable peeler or slice off the peel with a paring knife. Remove the seeds using an apple corer or by slicing out the core with a knife.
To peel peaches, plums, nectarines and other fruits with a thin skin, use the following process: slice an ""x"" in the skin at the top of the fruit. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.

Remove the pit by slicing the fruit in half and prying it out.

, Use a paring knife to cut the fruit into equal-sized slices for easier storage. Fruit dried whole may dry unevenly or take forever to completely dry out, so it's better to cut the fruit first.


Small fruits are the exception; there's no need to cut blueberries, raspberries, grapes or small strawberries before drying.

, It's best to dry fruit at a temperature of 200 °F (93 °C) or lower. If you use a higher temperature the fruit may end up baking instead of drying.


If you have a food dehydrator, use it according to the manufacturer's instructions.

, Spread it out in one even layer to cut back on the time it takes for the fruit to completely dry. Use a nonstick baking sheet to keep the fruit from sticking., The amount of time it takes to dry varies by the type of fruit you're using, how how your oven is running, and other factors. It could take as little as eight hours or as long as two days to completely dry the fruit.Test the fruit periodically to see if it's finished. Fully dry fruit should have a pleasing chewy texture and be completely devoid of moisture.

, Place it in an airtight storage container and store it in a cool, dark place. Dried fruit will keep for several months.

Arrive early.,
Talk to the farmers about their produce.,
Know which fruits and vegetables are in season.",How to Choose the Best Farmer's Market Produce1," Try to arrive to the farmer’s market as soon as it opens. This will guarantee you the freshest picks. There will also be a lot more variety for you to choose from., Ask them when the produce was picked. If they have a variety of one particular fruit or vegetable, like tomatoes, then ask about the difference between the different varieties. They may even give you a sample to taste.You can also ask them how and where the food was grown.

, When you go to the farmer’s market, only buy the fruits and vegetables that are in season. This way you can ensure that your produce stays fresh once you buy it and take it home.You can also avoid the feeling of disappointment from not finding your favorite fruit or vegetable if you know which ones are in season in your area.

"
"
Try dehydrating your food.,
Smoke meats.,
Cure meats.",How to Preserve Food2," By dehydrating your food, you take all of the liquids out. Once fully dehydrated, it’s very difficult for bacteria to form, creating a food that can last for weeks or months without refrigeration. The content of the food, including fiber content and calories, stays the same with dehydrating (except for a loss of Vitamin C in some foods because of its solubility).With a food dehydrator, available at some grocery stores and at many places online, you can preserve fruits, vegetables, and meats.


If you don’t want to buy a dehydrator, you can also get the same effect from a low-temperature oven. Use the oven on the lowest possible setting, place your food on a non-stick pan, and use a small fan to keep the air circulating and prevent any moisture buildup.The process takes all of the liquid out of the foods, preserving it in a new, chewier form.
Once dehydrated, you can store these foods without refrigeration for weeks. Dehydrating is particularly good for backpacking trips or other times when you need to carry your food with you., Smoked meats have been a way for people to preserve food for thousands of years. The kinds of wood for the fire and the spices you put on the meat itself can create an array of delicious flavors on the meat. There are two kinds of smoking – hot and cold. The differences are as follows:


When you smoke meat using the “hot” method, you are cooking it at a low temperature (150 degrees Fahrenheit and up) for a long time.
The “cold” method, on the other hand, is at less than 100 °F (37.8 °C) and is not really meant to cook the meat at all, but rather to seal the meat enough so that bacteria cannot grow in it. This method works particularly well if you’re planning to cook the meat at some other point in the future., Like smoking, curing is a process that has been around for thousands of years. The process involves using salt to leach the water out of meat, essentially dehydrating it. There are two main ways of curing meats:Dry curing involves rubbing the meat with salt and sodium nitrite and other spices of your choosing. The meat is then typically hung to dry. For safety, it’s best to purchase a prepared mixture of salt and nitrate -- the amount should be about 1 teaspoon per 5 pounds of meat, but follow any directions on the mix that dictate amounts.Wet curing or brining also uses salt, but in a liquid solution. Meat is placed into a “brine” made of water, salt, sodium nitrite, and other spices to cure. The typical mixture is about 1 ¼ cups of kosher salt per gallon of water."

Select brightly colored produce.,
Look for bruising.,
Feel for firmness.,
Smell for freshness.",How to Choose the Best Farmer's Market Produce2," The majority of fresh produce is vibrantly colored. Therefore, look for bright, shiny fruits and vegetables for the best picks. Additionally, the coloration of fruits and vegetable should be smooth and even (versus splotchy)., Try to avoid produce that contains bruises and soft spots. Bruises, soft spots, and spotting are signs that the produce is damaged or overripe., Fresh produce should be neither too hard nor too soft. Gently squeeze the produce. The produce should feel firm with a slight give. Also, try to feel for dents or pits under the surface. If you feel these, it may be an indication that the produce is overripe or damaged.Citrus fruits that are hard on the outside indicate a dry (as opposed to juicy) fruit.
In general, you want to look for potatoes, cucumbers, onions and peppers that are as firm as possible.

, For fruits, what you are looking for is a sweet, light smell. If the aroma is strong, sour, or pungent, then the fruits are most likely overripe or spoiled. Make sure to smell vegetables for freshness as well. Try to avoid any vegetables that have a moldy, sour, or rotten smell.If a fruit or vegetable does not smell like it is supposed to, then choose a different one.

Sniff and inspect melons.,
Check the bottom of the container for berries.,
Buy peaches with varying levels of firmness.,
Buy firm tomatoes.",How to Choose the Best Farmer's Market Produce3," For cantaloupe and honeydew, sniff the stem end for a light, sweet aroma. In terms of color, cantaloupe should have a golden color and honeydew should be light yellow. For watermelons, look for a yellow spot for ripeness.The yellow spots on watermelons indicate that they were resting on the ground before they were picked.

, For raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, and strawberries, the bottom of the container should not be stained or moist with berry juice. Also inspect the berries for any fuzzy mold. Instead, look for berries that are plump and full.For strawberries, select the ones that are entirely red all the way to the top, i.e., the cap.

, Do this for nectarines and apricots as well, unless you are planning to eat them that day. This way, you can enjoy perfectly ripe peaches throughout the week.For example, pick peaches that are slightly firm, moderately firm, and very firm to hard.

, Because tomatoes continue to ripen after they have been picked, do not be afraid to buy tomatoes that are slightly green near the top. In general, however, look for tomatoes that have a vibrant, red color. They should also be firm to the touch.Try to avoid tomatoes that have bruising and soft spots. This is an indication that they are too ripe.

"
Avoid wilting leafy greens.,
Choose small okra.,
Try to avoid shucking corn.,
Look at the base of root vegetables.,
Choose firm squash.",How to Choose the Best Farmer's Market Produce4," When buying leafy greens, the majority of the leaves should be smooth, plump, and unbroken. They should also have a vibrant green color. Leafy greens, as well as herbs, that are wilting are a sign that they are not fresh., Okra that are larger than five inches are typically tough and do not taste as good as smaller okra. Therefore, buy smaller sized okra., Instead, look for corn with bright green husks. The husks should also be tightly wrapped and slightly moist. Also feel the corn through the husks to make sure there are no missing kernels or dents—this means it is overripe. Also inspect the husks for brown wormholes.The corn’s tassels should be brown and slightly sticky.
Corn is the freshest once it is picked. Therefore, buy it in the morning and refrigerate it as soon as possible to prevent the sugars from converting into starches., Try to avoid root vegetables that have cracks near the base. Cracks indicate that the vegetables are dried out, and thus, not very fresh.Additionally, root vegetables, like potatoes, onions and garlic, should feel very firm (almost hard) to the touch.

, You want to do this since squash ripens quickly. Also, try to avoid squash that has bruising, cuts and/or blemishes. These signs indicate that it is not fresh.Smaller squash are typically sweeter.

Can foods using a water-bath method.,
Try canning with the pressure canning method.,
Pickle your food.,
Try the wild pickling or fermenting process.",How to Preserve Food3," Canning preserves the food in an air-free environment. Without air, there is no way for bacteria to form, allowing canned foods to have a shelf life of 1-5 years. Most fruits and acidic vegetables will be canned in a water bath. This method of canning, good for high-acid foods, involves placing food in sterilized canning jars, putting lids on them, and then lowering them into water that comes to a boil. Be sure to follow a recipe, or consult the website cited below for an array of canning ideas, recipes, and videos.Using this method, you can preserve:



Jams and jellies
Fruit pieces – peaches, apples, pears, pineapple, plums, etc.
Salsas
Tomatoes
Chutneys
Pickles

, This is the way you will need to can meats and most vegetables, all of which are low-acid. Keep in mind that if you are putting a high-acid and a low-acid food together to be canned, you must also use this method. Like the water-bath method, pressure canning requires you to fill sterilized jars with the food you want to can, cover with the appropriate lids and then placing them into a pressure canner with boiling water in it. You will then lock the pressure canner lid into place and vent it, allowing it to create steam for 10 minutes. As was the case with the water-bath method, be sure to use a recipe.This method is best for:


Vegetables – corn, green beans,
Soups and stews

Stock – both vegetable and meat
Meat
Poultry
Fish

, Pickling refers to multiple processes – usually involving fermentation and canning though it might be only one or the other. The usual pickling process is for cucumber pickles involves canning them in a vinegar brine. This process can also be used for an array of other fruits and vegetables, including:Okra
Peppers
Ginger
Green beans
Brussels sprouts
Cauliflower
Eggplant
Watermelon rinds
Lemons
Pineapple

, Ferment cucumbers or cabbage to make pickles and sauerkraut. Both classic pickles and sauerkraut are made through a fermentation process, typically lasting three weeks. The vegetable is salted and put into a pickling crock. The water comes out of the vegetable as it ferments, creating a new flavor. Even though the cucumbers are also called “pickles,” like those canned in vinegar brine, they are actually fermented to preserve them."

You can find high-quality quail eggs in many higher-end grocery stores or farmer's markets.
Some people prefer to let their eggs sit in the fridge for 1-2 weeks so they ""loosen up"" a bit and are easier to peel.;
,,


Just remember that quail eggs are a bit more delicate than regular eggs, so you should be careful when handling them so they don't crack.

, Allow the eggs to sit and obtain room temperature before boiling.


The water should reach about 1 inch (2.54 cm) above the top of the eggs.
You can also use a saucepan instead of a pot.

,, Some people think you should remove the eggs immediately after they boil, while others say they should boil for at least three minutes. Others also recommend removing the eggs from the heat as soon as they boil and letting them sit, and therefore continue to cook, for another three minutes. The important thing is not to overcook them or they will get too rubbery once you place them in the brine.If you let them sit for a few minutes, you can stir them carefully during this process.

,, Pour the vinegar to at least 1 inch (2.54 cm) above the top of the eggs.


Leave the eggs in the white vinegar for 12 hours to soften the membrane and make peeling an easier task.
If you do this, then you should stir the eggs in the pot every few minutes.
Rinse the vinegar from the eggs with fresh water when you're done.
Of course, you can skip this step and move right on to pickling the eggs, if you don't have the patience for it.

, This often makes the peeling of the tough shell and membrane easier.

, You can discard those shells in your compost bin.

,


Be careful about not breaking the yolk of the eggs as you handle this. This can lead that pickling mixture to get a bit murky.

, The size of jar you choose depends on your needs. Make sure that the jars have been properly sterilized and that they have lids that seal tightly. You can pat the eggs dry with a paper towel before transferring them to the canning jars.

, You can make the mixture while preparing the eggs, or after you've made them. Each mixture will be made slightly differently, so it's important to follow directions when you choose your mixture. Here's how you can make each of the mixtures here:


To make the purple pickling mixture, simply combine all of the pickling ingredients in a small pan and bring them to a boil over medium heat. Continue to stir the mixture to dissolve the salt and sugar. Let the mixture cool to room temperature, which should take 30 minutes or so.To make the hot and spicy pickling mixture, just bring the ingredients to a boil in a saucepan and set them aside for 30 minutes to let them cool. When the time comes to pour the mixture into the eggs, use a chopstick to poke the bay leaves and coriander seeds deep into the jar with the eggs.To make the golden pickling mixture, simply place all the pickling ingredients in a medium saucepan, bring them to a boil over medium heat, cover them, reduce the heat to low, and let the pan simmer for 30 minutes. Then, chill the liquid in the fridge for 20 minutes or so and then it's good to go., Carefully pour the mixture over the eggs. You can use a mesh strainer or a cup measurer with a little spout so you don't dump all of the liquid over the eggs at once.


Wipe off the lids of the pickling mixture before closing the lids.

,, For an added measure, you can process the jars in hot water for 10 minutes before you set them aside to cool.


Once you've sealed the lids, you can give the jars a gentle shake to make sure that the spices are distributed evenly.
You can even turn the jars upside down and then right side up again if you can do so carefully.

, How long you refrigerate them for depends on your preferences and the mixture you're using.


For the purple mixture, you can refrigerate it for at least a day and up a week.For the hot and spicy mixture, it's best if you store it in the fridge for 2 weeks before eating it.For the golden egg mixture, you should store it for at least a couple of days before eating it. You can eat it for up to a month after pickling it., Enjoy these tasty eggs on their own, sprinkled with a dash of parsley, or with a bit of coarse salt.

, You can use a cooling rack or another rack that has vents to allow air circulation from below. If possible, avoid using a solid cooking sheet or tray, since the lack of air flow will make it more difficult for the peppers to dry evenly.


Put the tray in a sunny, well-ventilated room. The kitchen windowsill is a great spot.
Let them dry for three or more days, then store them in an airtight container.

, This is an easy and decorative way to dry them. Once the chilies are dry, you can keep them hanging up or store them for later use. Here's how to do it:


Thread a needle with a long piece of strong thread or fishing line. Pierce the chilies just under their caps to thread the needle through them. Do this until all of the chilies have been threaded.
Hang them in a well ventilated and sunny place in your home.
In three days to a week, they’ll be dry and ready to use.

, This is a good technique if you can't wait days, and don't want to wait for the chilies to dry out naturally. Instead of keeping the chilies whole, slicing them helps them dry evenly and quickly. Follow these simple steps:


Slice the cleaned chilies in half lengthwise.
Lay them seed-side up on a baking sheet.
Bake at 125 degrees F (or your lowest setting) for several hours. This is still a lengthy process but quicker than air drying.
You could also use a food dehydrator for quick results.

Soak the pumpkin in a bleach solution.,
Wipe the pumpkin dry.,
Spray with additional bleach.,
Continue drying the pumpkin upside-down.,
Coat the cut areas with petroleum jelly.Rub all of the exposed flesh with a fine coating of petroleum jelly.,
Wipe away the excess.,
Keep the pumpkin cool and moist.Display your pumpkin in a spot that does not receive direct sunlight.",How to Preserve a Pumpkin1," Mix together 1 tsp (5 mL) of bleach and 1 gallon (4 L) of water.Let the pumpkin soak in this solution for at least 1 hour.


The water is intended to hydrate the pumpkin flesh and prevent it from drying out too quickly. The bleach is an antimicrobial agent that will kill most of the surface bacteria and mold spores on the pumpkin.
You can soak the pumpkin up to 8 hours, but soaking it too long can actually infuse the flesh with too much moisture, making it more prone to rot.;
, Use a clean rag or paper towels to remove most of the moisture puddled inside the pumpkin. Dry the outside of the pumpkin, as well.


Leaving too much moisture puddled inside can actually cause the pumpkin to rot.

, Combine 1 Tbsp (15 mL) of bleach with 1 quart (1 L) of water in a spray bottle. Douse the exposed flesh with this stronger bleach solution.


The bleach used in the soaking solution was a small amount only intended to stop the growth of surface bacteria. Using too much bleach in the soaking solution can weaken the pumpkin. By spraying the pumpkin with a stronger bleach solution after soaking it, you can sanitize it further without weakening the structure of the pumpkin.

, Prevent puddles of moisture from sitting inside the pumpkin by inverting it onto a clean, dry rag and letting it dry completely.


Give the pumpkin at least 20 minutes to dry. You could let it sit up to 1 hour if desired, though.

,


The petroleum jelly will lock in moisture, preventing the pumpkin from dehydrating as quickly as it might do otherwise. It will also block out new bacteria and mold.
Do not use petroleum jelly without first using bleach. The bleach is needed in order to kill bacteria and mold already on the pumpkin. If you skip this step and go straight to the petroleum jelly, you will actually trap preexisting bacteria and mold on the surface of the pumpkin, thereby speeding the decay process.
Vegetable oil or a vegetable oil spray could also be used instead of petroleum jelly.

, If you got excess petroleum jelly on the non-carved portions of the pumpkin, wipe it away with a clean rag or paper towel.


Note that this is more for the sake of appearance rather than necessity.

, A shaded area works best.


Heat will speed the decay process and placing it in a dry area will cause the flesh to dehydrate.
When not in use, consider storing the pumpkin in a refrigerator or draping a damp towel over it.

Pour the hot water into the container with the apportioned food, or into the single-serving pouch.,
Wait 8 or 9 minutes for the food to cook and reabsorb the water.",How to Prepare Freeze Dried Foods for Camping1,"


Some cooks advise adding 20 percent more water than the directions call for. Adding more water will make the food soupier.;
,


Some freeze-dried foods come in canisters with more than one portion. If the instructions on the package call for 2 cups (400 grams) of freeze-dried food, put 2 cups of food into a container that you can cover after adding hot water.
Freeze-dried food also comes in pre-measured, single-serving pouches to which you add hot water.

Wash and slice the chilies.,
Pack the chilies in a sterilized jar.,
Heat white vinegar to a low boil.,
Store in the refrigerator.",How to Preserve Chilies2," It's not completely necessary You may quarter them or slice them lengthwise. If you prefer to preserve the chilies whole, use a knife to make a small slit in the side of each chile, which helps to preserve the shape. Depending on how hot you want your pickled chiles to be, you can remove the seeds or keep them.

, Choose a clean canning jar and fill it to within an inch of the rim with chiles. Make sure the jar has a tight-fitting lid. Plastic is preferable, since it won't rust in the refrigerator.


If you want to flavor the chilies, mix in three tablespoons of salt and 15 peppercorns before packing the chilies. This will lend the chilies a flavor similar to that of pickled jalapeño  served in restaurants.
Other spices, such as bay leaves or fresh herbs, can also be added to the mixture to flavor the peppers.

, Use about two cups of vinegar, or enough to pour into the jar and cover the peppers completely. When the vinegar is hot, Pour the hot vinegar over the peppers. Fill the jar to within about half an inch of the top.


If you want the peppers to have a sweet flavor, dissolve six teaspoons of sugar into the vinegar.Let the contents of the jar cool for a few minutes.

, The longer you let the mixture sit, the stronger the pickled taste will get. Enjoy the pickled peppers as a side dish or on sandwiches. The spicy vinegar makes an excellent salad dressing.

Wash the chilies.,
Freeze small peppers whole.,
Freeze large peppers in strips.",How to Preserve Chilies3," Discard any damaged chilies, since they won't keep well in the freezer., If you have small peppers that you'd like to freeze whole, you can simply put them in a freezer bag. Use a straw to suck out the excess air, then seal and label the bag before placing it in the freezer.


Pack the bag as tightly as possible, so there's little extra air in the bag. Air will make the peppers spoil faster.
Freeze for several months. When you want to use the peppers, simply leave them out to thaw or blanch them in boiling water for a few seconds.

, Bigger peppers can be sliced into strips or chunks you can easily use in a recipe later on. Slice them lengthwise or into chunks and remove the seeds.


Lay the pieces on a baking sheet and freeze them for an hour. This is called flash freezing.
Put the pieces in a storage bag and remove the extra air.
Store in the freezer for up to several months.

Leave in as many seeds as you want depending on the heat level you desire. Lay them out on a baking sheet in a single layer., Cooking the chilies before preserving them will help to bring out the best in their flavor. You can roast them over a grill or a gas burner.


Preheat your oven's broil, or prepare your grill.
Roast the slices until they’re charred. Under the broiler, this should take just a few minutes. Turn them once during the process so they cook evenly on all sides.

, Put the peppers in a clean jar or bottle. You may want to use a decorative olive oil container. Pour olive oil over the peppers until they're entirely covered. Store the jar in a cool, dark place.

Select a pumpkin with a long stem.,
Clean the pumpkin with soap and water.,
Wipe the pumpkin dry.,
Spray the pumpkin with rubbing alcohol.,
Dry the pumpkin out over several weeks.,
Seal the surface of the pumpkin.",How to Preserve a Pumpkin2," The best option is a freshly harvested pumpkin with at least 2 inches (5 cm) of stem.


A long stem is important because it helps wick away moisture from the pumpkin. A pumpkin with no stem or a very short stem is more likely to retain moisture.

, Combine 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 mL) of mild dish detergent with 1 gallon (4 L) warm water in a large bucket. Wash the pumpkin in this solution to remove surface bacteria.


Use a mild liquid dish soap instead of a harsh cleanser. Harsh cleansers can be too abrasive.
Rinse the soapy solution off the pumpkin once finished.

, Use a clean rag or clean paper towels to dry the pumpkin completely.


This preservation method aims to dry the pumpkin out rather than keeping it moist. As such, you should manually remove as much of the moisture as possible by wiping it away.

, Pour a little rubbing alcohol into a spray bottle and mist the surface of the pumpkin, coating it completely without drenching it.


You could also spray the pumpkin with a household cleaner.
Rubbing alcohol and household cleaners are both used to protect the surface from new bacteria and mold spores.
Do no drench the pumpkin. Too much rubbing alcohol can be abrasive and might cause damage to the pumpkin. Too much could also cause moisture to build.

, Place the pumpkin on several layers of newspaper in a dark, warm, dry area. Let it dry out for several weeks until the pumpkin feels notably lighter.


Make sure that the area you choose has good ventilation. Otherwise, the air can become stagnant, causing moisture to build up as a result. Moisture can cause the pumpkin to rot.
Warmth speeds up the drying process and darkness preserves the color. You could also place the pumpkins beneath an electric fan to speed the drying process further.
Change the newspaper every few days. As it absorbs the moisture of the pumpkin, it will become damp. This dampness can cause your pumpkin to rot if it is not removed.
In addition to feeling lighter, you should also be able to hear seeds rattling around inside the pumpkin when you pick it up.

, After the pumpkin has dried out completely, apply a coat of paste wax over the surface to seal it and protect it against bacteria.


Clear shellac can also be used instead of paste wax.

Remove the pulp.,
Mash the pulp.,
Cool the pumpkin.,
Pack the pumpkin into rigid containers.,
Freeze the pumpkin until ready to use.",How to Preserve a Pumpkin3," The pumpkin should be a deep orange color on the outside, and its flesh should have a fine texture.


Avoid using pumpkins with stringy or dry flesh.
A pumpkin of higher quality will last longer and better than one of low quality.
This method preserves the pumpkin by freezing it. Freezing is the easiest way to preserve pumpkins and is also thought to produce the best quality product., Rinse the pumpkin under lukewarm running water.


If necessary, gently scrub the pumpkin with a vegetable brush to remove dirt and debris from the surface.
Soap is not necessary, nor is it advised.

, Use a large serrated knife to cut the pumpkin in half. Then, cut each half into 2- to 3-inch (5- to 7.6-cm) chunks.


A serrated knife is recommended. A smooth blade is more likely to slip against the tough skin of the pumpkin, which could cause you to accidentally cut yourself.
You could peel the pumpkin chunks before boiling them, but waiting until after the pumpkin has been cooked will be easier.

, Place the pumpkin chunks in a medium saucepan and cover them with water. Boil the pumpkin for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until the flesh feels tender.


You could also bake the pumpkin. Cut the pumpkin in half and place each half, face-down, in a baking dish. Cover with foil and cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) for 1.5 hours., Let the cooked pumpkin cool enough for you to handle it. Scrape the pulp from rind and transfer it to a medium bowl.


Use a metal spoon or similarly rigid utensil to dig out the flesh.
Once cooked, the flesh should separate from the skin with relative ease.

, Use a potato masher to mash the already soft pulp into a puree.


You could also accomplish this task with a hand-held immersion blender or a food processor.

, Place the bowl or pan containing the pumpkin in cold water until the pumpkin puree cools to room temperature.


Do not allow excess water to get into the mashed pumpkin.
Stir the mashed pumpkin occasionally as it cools.

, Use containers made from non-reactive materials like plastic or glass. Make sure that the containers are approved for freezer use.


Leave at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of empty headspace in between the top of the pumpkin and the top of container. This will allow the pumpkin to expand as it freezes.
Tightly seal the containers before freezing them.

, The pumpkin should last about 3 to 6 months without developing any change in flavor or texture. At best, you may even be able to keep the pumpkin for over a year.

Many picklers mix hot peppers and red or green sweet peppers for a balanced flavor, but the the peppers you choose are up to you. However, there are some characteristics you should keep in mind, regardless of what type of peppers you use:Look for peppers that are firm and have a smooth skin.
Avoid old peppers that are soft and wrinkled or have brown spots, as old peppers can taste bad and become chewy when pickled.;
, This is the standard amount. The step-by-step process listed below will yield 9 pint jars.A bushel of peppers generally weighs 25 pounds and can yield 20 to 30 pints.

, You can use cold or lukewarm water with the same results.

, Remove any bad spots on the peppers. Quarter the now seedless peppers.


Small peppers can be left whole. If you choose to leave them whole, cut several slits along their sides., If you have already cut your peppers, make sure to place them skin side down during whatever heating method you choose to use.


Preheat your oven or broiler to 400º or 450ºF (205º to 232ºC). Place the peppers on a cookie sheet and stick them in the oven or broiler for 6 to 8 minutes. Using tongs, turn the peppers often so that they blister evenly on all sides.Place peppers on a wire mesh for the stovetop method. Hold the wire mesh over a heated electric or gas burner. Turn the peppers frequently with a pair of tongs. Make sure each side is heated equally.Heat an outdoor grill. Place the peppers 5 to 6 inches above glowing coals. Rotate the peppers using tongs., Place a damp cloth over them. Doing this allows the peppers to cool quickly and makes the skins easier to peel., Occasionally rinse the peppers with water.Use a knife to scrape off any skin that does not peel easily.

, Place 5 cups (1.2l) vinegar, 1 cups (240ml) water, 4 tsp. (20g) pickling salt, 2 tbsp. (28g) sugar and 2 cloves of garlic in a pot.The garlic is optional. It adds to the flavor but is not necessary.

, Once boiling, reduce the heat to a simmer for 10 minutes.

, Discard used garlic cloves.

, You don't want any bacteria festering in your jar of pickled peppers.

, Leave them in the pot for 10 minutes.

,, Leave 1 inch of space at the top of the jar. Flatten whole peppers.Add ½ a teaspoon of salt if you would like your peppers to be saltier.

, Leave a 1/2 in. (1.3cm) of space at the top of the jars.

, Bubbles can cause mold to form inside the jar once it has been sealed.

,,, Once all of the jars are placed inside, lower the rack down into the canner.


If you do not have a canner, you can make your own. Find a pot or saucepan that is large enough to hold the jars. There should also be room for an inch of water above the jars. Place a washcloth or towel at the bottom of the pot before you put the jars in. This will keep the jars from directly touching the metal of the pot.
If you do not have a jar lifter, place rubber bands at the ends of tongs. The tongs will act exactly like a jar lifter.

,, Be sure that the water is at a constant boil for 10 minutes., After 2 minutes, remove the jars from the canner and place them in a safe place to cool.

, Allow the peppers to continue pickling for 4-5 days before opening.


Be sure to refrigerate the jar once it has been opened. As the mixture cools, the lid of the mason jar should make a popping sound, which signifies that it has been sealed properly. If there is no popping sound, then refrigerate the jar once it reaches room temperature.
Use jalapeños within two weeks of opening.

, Try slicing up the peppers and adding them to salsa, tacos, fajitas, and any other Mexican dish.

Get the canner going.,
Leave the jars in the canner, on low boil, for 15 minutes.,
Remove the jars from the hot water and allow to cool completely.",How to Pickle Garlic," Before you start, you want to make sure that you don't introduce bacteria into your canning jars. The slightest bit of contamination can ruin a perfectly good batch of garlic, so make sure they're sterilized properly beforehand. After sterilized, put them on a freshly cleaned towel on the kitchen counter to air-dry.


Perhaps the easiest way to do this is to wash the jars and lids in the dishwasher on the ""sterilize"" cycle. If you do not have a dishwasher or a dishwasher with a sterilize function, put the jars and lids into boiling water for 10 minutes to sterilize them.
When handling freshly-sterilized cans and lids, use clean tongs or canning tongs. Any interaction between human skin and the jars or lids could transfer unwanted bacteria.
Try not to use old jam or jelly jars as your canning jars, as these don't preserve properly. Instead, opt for mason jars. If you want to use old jam jars, you'll need to keep your pickled garlic refrigerated at all times and use it up within three months.;
, You can let it heat up while you prepare the garlic and pickling solution for canning.

, When you're dealing in bulk, peeling one pound of garlic can get tedious. You'll want to peel those suckers efficiently. There are two basic ways you can peel a lot of garlic very quickly:



Shake them up. Break up the garlic bulbs and place the cloves into a metal bowl. Invert another identical metal bowl over the first bowl to create a locked seal. Grip the bowls tightly with both hands and shake vigorously for up to 30 seconds. Your cloves should be completely peeled!

Blanch the garlic. Break up the garlic bulbs and sink into boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove and put them into cold water to stop the cooking. Separate the peel from the clove in the water. The peels should easily slide off after they are blanched.

, Mix together the water, vinegar, and salt in a pot and bring to a simmer. Make sure the salt is completely dissolved


Use a stainless steel, teflon, porcelain or glass pot. Do not use a copper pot; too much copper present in the water may cause the garlic to turn green or blue.

, Four pint-sized mason jars should accommodate one pound of garlic. Into each of the four mason jars, place 1/4 of the desired spices, along with one sprig of thyme and one bay leaf.

, Be careful not to overstuff — all garlic should eventually be fully submerged in the pickling solution.

, Screw the lid on securely, but do not over-tighten it. The process of heating and cooling the jars will create an airtight seal.

, Raise the temperature on the burner under the canner to bring the water to a slow boil. Put the jars of garlic into the canner using jar tongs.


Add more boiling water to the canner if necessary to bring the water level to at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) over the tops of the jars.
Place a metal standing tray on the bottom of your canner for the mason jars to rest atop. The mason jars may break if they sit on the bottom of the canner, next to the direct heat from the burner.

, The process of heating the pickling solution up — and then eventually cooling it down — will create a vacuum seal in the headspace, preserving the garlic.

, Take care not to tilt the jars when removing them. Make sure the jars are sealed properly with this simple trick:


After they are completely cool, push on the center of each jar to see if it pops up and down. If it does, the jar has not sealed properly.
Restart the canning process with the jars that didn't seal if you have too many to use up quickly. Use new lids on the jars and leave them in the canner for the full 15 minutes again.

Eat soon.",How to Make Stale Bread Soft Again1," Set your oven to 300ºF (150ºC). The heat will restore most stale bread, although the effect will only last a few hours., Even stale bread still contains plenty of water. It feels dry because the starch molecules have linked up and trapped the water. This means you don't need to add water to the crumb of the bread. If the bread has a hard outer crust, flick water onto it, or run it under the cold tap if extremely stale.If the bread turned dry from overheating, or if it was exposed to air, it has lost some of its water.Wet the whole loaf to restore moisture.

, This prevents steam from escaping, keeping the moisture trapped in the bread instead.

, If you dampened the bread, wait until it no longer feels soggy. Depending on the size of the loaf and whether or not you added water, this could take 5–15 minutes.

, If the bread is soft but the once-hard crust is squishy, take off the foil. Keep heating for another five minutes, or until you've restored the crust to the right texture., Heat ""melts"" the starch molecule structure to release the trapped water, but also speeds up staling once the bread cools down.The bread will only last a few hours at most before it turns stale again."

Break off a lobe of ginger.,
Use a paring knife to peel the ginger.,
Use a vegetable peeler.,
Peel with a spoon.",How to Slice Ginger1," When you purchase raw ginger, it will look like a knobby root with a few sections that can be broken off. Hold the ginger in both hands and use pressure to break off one of the lobes. This can make working with the ginger a bit easier., Hold the ginger in one hand and the knife firmly in your dominant hand. Slowly and carefully cut the surface of ginger, removing the top layer of the ginger, thus removing the skin.


Peeling is often done for the aesthetics. Leaving the skin on can enhance the flavor of the ginger., Holding the vegetable peeler in one hand and the ginger in the other, begin scraping the skin off the ginger. The skin of the ginger root is thin, flaky, and almost translucent, so it should come off easily. The most difficult part of this process is navigating the rough, uneven surface of the ginger, which can be a bit more troublesome using a vegetable peeler.

, Hold the ginger firmly in one hand and a spoon in your dominant hand. With the convex side of spoon facing toward you, scrape the edge of it against the ginger, peeling off the skin. Peel only as much as you think you will use. Store the rest."

Bring water to a boil in the base of a steamer.,
Place the stale loaf in the steamer basket.,
Leave covered until the bread is soft.",How to Make Stale Bread Soft Again2," Pour a shallow layer of water into the pan. Heat over high until the water reaches a rolling boil, then remove from heat.


If you don't have a steamer, you'll need a colander that sits on top of the pan, and a lid that can fit over the colander.
This methods adds less heat than the oven, but more moisture. The extra moisture is most helpful when the bread is very stale and hard, or if it was left out unwrapped.

, Place the basket over the steaming pan and cover with a lid.

, Give the steam at least five minutes to soften the bread.

Slice bread to eat right away.,
Wrap in a damp paper towel.,
Heat in ten second intervals.",How to Make Stale Bread Soft Again3," Microwaves do soften bread, but the results aren't perfect. Within a few minutes, the bread usually turns rubbery and even tougher than before.This is the fastest method, but it's best to save it for an immediate snack.


This happens because the microwave boils away some of the water. The escaping steam pushes the starches into a denser structure, and leaves the bread dry. Slow heating in small increments can reduce this effect, but it's difficult to find a sweet spot that's still hot enough to soften the bread.

, Lightly dampen a plain, white paper towel. Wrap it around your bread.This adds more moisture, and traps some of the steam in the bread to keep it soft.

, Depending on how strong your microwave is, the bread might already be soft after ten seconds. If not, try again, checking frequently.

Prepare to cut the ginger.,
Cut across the fibers of the ginger.,
Cut the ginger into coins.,
Julienne the ginger.,
Mince the ginger.",How to Slice Ginger2," Hold a clean, sharp chef’s knife in your dominant hand and hold the ginger firmly against a cutting board. Take care not to let the ginger slip or slide while you are cutting.

, Ginger is a very fibrous root; the fibers run along the length of the root and its lobes. Cut across the fibers so that the knife is perpendicular to them while you are cutting.

, As you cut the ginger across the fibers, you will be cutting little round shapes, aptly named “coins”. You can use these coins as they are (which are great for making candied ginger) or you can continue slicing., Stack two or three of the coins that you just cut and begin cutting them into slivers. These slivers can be as thick or thin as you desire. If you intend to chop or mince the ginger, you should make these slivers fairly slim.

, Line up several of the ginger matchsticks. Cut the sticks crosswise. In other words, you will be cutting them perpendicular to the length of the ginger.

"
Freeze the ginger.,
Use a ginger grating plate.,
Use a metal grater.",How to Slice Ginger3," Wrap the ginger in plastic and store it in your freezer. This is a useful trick for grating ginger. Freezing the ginger makes it much easier to grate. When you are ready to use the ginger, peel off the plastic and scrape away the skin, if you would like.

, There are special graters created for ginger. They usually look like a ceramic shallow bowl, with a raised area containing small ceramic teeth, used to grate the surface of the ginger. Hold the bowl firmly against the countertop and rub the ginger back and forth across the teeth. This will yield finely sliced ginger and the bowl will catch some of the juice.


Depending on how strong you would like the flavor of ginger to be in your dish, you can choose to peel or leave the skin on.

, If you prefer peeled ginger, scrape away the skin. Hold a microplane grater in one hand, usually your non-dominant hand, and frozen ginger in the other. Press the ginger against the grater and begin scraping it quickly back and forth, lengthwise along the grater. Place a bowl or plate underneath the grater to catch the bits of ginger that fall from the grater.

Prepare the tomatoes and peppers.,
Combine the ingredients in a saucepan.,
Bring to a boil.,
Simmer for 5 to 10 minutes.,
Prepare your canning supplies.,
Ladle the hot Rotel into the hot jars.,
Place the jars in your canner.,
Process for 35 to 60 minutes.Allow the water in your canner to reach a soft boil.,
Remove and let cool.,
Check the jars and store them adequately.",How to Make Your Own Ro‐Tel," The tomatoes need to be cored, peeled, and quartered. The chili peppers need to be washed, stemmed, seeded, and chopped.


To peel the tomatoes, dunk them in boiling water for about 30 seconds, them immediately transfer them to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking process. This process loosens the skins, and you should be able to remove them easily with your fingers or a small knife.
You can use any chili pepper you want based on your desired level of spiciness. For milder options, consider Anaheim or ancho peppers. For a spicier option, mix in a few jalapeno peppers.
Leaving the seeds in the peppers will make the finished product spicier.
Chop the peppers into fine pieces. You can take a shortcut on this by rough-chopping the peppers into large pieces with a knife and chopping them down further using a food processor.;
, Place the tomatoes, peppers, salt, black pepper, cilantro, oregano, and vinegar (or lemon juice) into a large saucepan or stockpot. Mix to combine well.


Tomatoes are mildly acidic, so you'll need to add a stronger acid to the mixture before canning them. Bottled lemon juice, white vinegar, and apple cider vinegar are all good options, but each one will contribute its own flavor. You could also use 1.5 tsp (7.5 ml) of concentrated citric acid, instead.

, Set the saucepan on the stove over medium-high heat. Allow the contents to reach a low boil.


Leave the saucepan uncovered.
Gently stir the contents of the pot as it comes up to a boil. If you do not stir the ingredients often enough, they could stick to the bottom of the pan and burn, which could negatively affect the flavor of the finished product.

, Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the mixture simmer, stirring it occasionally, until it thickens to your desired consistency.Note that this mixture may end up being a little more watery than commercial Ro-Tel, but since the liquid in this recipe has a high acid content, it will help preserve your homemade product for a longer period of time.
Once the mixture is done cooking, cover the pan and remove it from the heat as you finish preparing your jars for canning.

, Sterilize the glass jars, lids, and rings with hot water before or while the homemade Rotel cooks. Fill a hot water canner with enough water to cover the jars.


You should wash the glass jars with hot water and soap. Scrub thoroughly, rinse well, and dry.
Sanitize metal lids and rings by soaking them in hot water for at least 5 minutes.
You need to keep the glass jars hot after you finish cleaning them. Otherwise, they could crack when you expose them to the heat of the Rotel or the heat of your water bath. You can do so by simply letting the jars sit in a sink of hot water.Prepare the canner by filling it three-quarters high with water. Do not begin to heat the water yet, however.
Note that if you do not have an actual water-bath canner, you can use a large stockpot. Just make sure that the stockpot can safely fit all of your jars at once.

, Fill the jars with the tomato-pepper mixture, leaving 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace at the top of each jar. Place the lids and rings on each jar when ready.Before placing the lids on your jars, pop any visible bubbles with a thin spatula and wipe the rims clean with a damp paper towel.
Make sure that you use all of the liquid, and try to ladle the liquid into the jars in even proportions.

, Carefully lower the jars into the water of your canner using jar tongs.


If you have to heat the water in your canner using the stove, make sure that the canner is already sitting on your stove before you place the jars in it.
Do not let the jars knock into each other as you lower them in the water or once they're already sitting in the water.

, Once the water starts boiling, start the timer.


Adjust the heat as needed to keep the canner at a soft boil throughout the entire process.
For 1-pint (500-ml) size jars:

Process 35 minutes at altitudes between 0 and 1000 ft (0 and 305 m).
Process 40 minutes at altitudes between 1000 and 3000 ft (305 and 914 m).
Process 45 minutes at altitudes between 3000 and 6000 ft (914 and 1829 m).
Process 50 minutes at altitudes above 6000 ft (1829 m).


For 1-quart (1-L) size jars:

Process 45 minutes at altitudes between 0 and 1000 ft (0 and 305 m).
Process 50 minutes at altitudes between 1000 and 3000 ft (305 and 914 m).
Process 55 minutes at altitudes between 3000 and 6000 ft (914 and 1829 m).
Process 60 minutes at altitudes above 6000 ft (1829 m).



, After you finish processing the jars, carefully remove them from the hot water with jar tongs. Sit them on a wire rack or towel-covered counter and let them cool for 12 to 24 hours before touching them.


You need to be even more cautious about preventing the jars from knocking into each other during this step. The glass is especially sensitive at this point, so it is even more likely to crack than it was when you lowered the jars into the canner.

, Make sure that the button in the center of each lid is flat. Properly sealed jars can be stored in a dark, cool pantry or cupboard for several months to a year.


Store any improperly sealed cans in the refrigerator and use the contents of the jar within one to two weeks.

Choose a suitable bread knife.,
Place your loaf of bread on a large, wooden cutting board.,
Consider slicing large, round loaves in half.,
Place your hand over the crust and gently grip the loaf by the sides.,
Go into the crust at a slight angle.,
Saw downwards once the knife pierces the crust.",How to Slice Bread1," The best bread knives will have a deep, serrated edge. The blade should extend all the way into the handle. If the blade only extends partway into the handle, then your knife won't have enough support.Some people find that bread knives with a wavy edge are easier to cut with than bread knives with a jagged edge.;
, The board should be a little longer than the loaf of bread itself. This way, you will have enough room for the slices as you cut them. Position the loaf towards one end of the board. You'll start cutting from the side that has the most board space available.

, If you have a really large loaf of bread, you might find it easier to work with if slice it right down the middle. This way, you'll end up with two semi-circles. When you go to slice these halves, place the halves cut-side-down on the board., This will keep it from slipping around on the cutting board. Avoid pressing down on top of the loaf. This will only mush the bread inside.

, Position your knife close to the heel of the loaf. Angle it slightly and saw into the bread., As soon as the knife gets into the bread, position the knife so that the blade edge is parallel to the cutting board. Use a back and forth sawing motion as you cut downward. Apply only a little bit of pressure; if you have a good knife, you won't have to press hard at all.


You can make the slices as thin or as thick as you want them. A good guideline is ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) thick.
You can also use the width of your finger as a cutting guide."

Wash the melon, knife, and melon baller.,
Cut the melon in half and remove the seeds.,
Sink the baller fully into the flesh.,
Rotate the baller 180 degrees.,
Vary ball sizes with other tools.",How to Use a Melon Baller1," Scrub the whole melon with a clean brush under cool, running water. If you skip this step, bacteria on the rind can easily contaminate the melon flesh during slicing. Wash the knife and melon baller in hot, soapy water.Don't wash the melon until you're ready to cut it, as a wet rind may encourage mold.Avoid soap and detergent, which may penetrate to the flesh.Produce washes are harmless, but unnecessary.;
, Leaving it in two halves provides a bowl to catch the juice. That said, it's not a big deal if you've already cut it into quarters or slices. If your melon has a center full of seed pulp, scoop this out with a large spoon and discard it.

, Hold the scoop flat against the melon, or at a slight angle. Press down into the melon until the entire scoop has sunk into the flesh. If a portion of the scoop is above the melon level, you'll end up with irregular chunks instead of spheres.

, Turn the melon baller 180º, until the scoop is facing you. There should be a perfect ball of melon sitting in the scoop.


If your melon balls still aren't satisfactory, rotate two full rotations before you remove the scoop.If you're using a baller with a plastic scoop or handle, don't apply too much force. These may break if used on dense fruits.

, Many melon ballers come with a different size scoop on each end of the handle. Try round, metal measuring spoons instead if you want to make balls of additional sizes.Plastic measuring spoons may work on soft fruit such as watermelon.

Dispose of the core.,
Slice the apple.",How to Slice an Apple1," The apple should rest upright on its own, but you may need hold it steady to ensure a clean cut.;
, Hold a sharp knife in your dominant hand. Slightly offset the blade from the stem so that you avoid slicing through the core. Try, however, to cut as close to the core as possible.Once the knife is in place, apply force to push the blade straight down to the cutting board. Slice through all the sides of the apple until only the core remains.Cut the apple into thirds or quarters – whichever is easiest for you. Quarters will preserve more of the edible apple around the core, but thirds may take slightly less time to cut., Compost the core, if possible.If you don't have access to a compost bin, put the core into the garbage.


Feel free to nibble away any remaining apple that clings to the core. Avoid eating the seeds!

, Place the flat side of each large slice face down on the cutting board. Then, use the knife to slice or dice the apple into pieces. You can make thin slices for snacking or baking. Try dicing the apple to mix into salads and other dishes!"

Wipe the blade with a wet, soapy cloth.,
Dry thoroughly.,
Store away from children and pets.,
Give it a thorough clean when necessary.",How to Use a Mandoline," Fold out the mandoline's legs and place them on a sturdy, dry cutting board. The mandoline should never wobble or slip during use.


Make sure the cutting board is clean, as it will come into contact with the chopped food.;
, Keep the raised end closest to you. Pushing down and forward gives you the most control. Do not set the mandoline parallel to you, as a side-to-side slice can cause slipping or uneven results., If you're cutting a potato, lemon, or other round fruit or vegetable, cut it in half. The mandoline can only slice a flat surface. Keep the other end round to give you a better grip.You may need to cut it into smaller pieces to fit inside the hand guard.

, If you're cutting potatoes or another dry, starchy food, sprinkle a few drops of water across the cutting surface. This ensures that the food will slide across it smoothly.


Juicy fruits and vegetables usually produce enough moisture on their own.

, Almost all mandolines come with a hand guard, usually shaped like a bell or cylinder. Place the food in the hand guard so the flat side faces the runway, then slot the hand guard over the mandoline. Mandoline blades can easily slice off the tip of your finger. Only professionals should use a mandoline without the hand guard (and they have the scars to prove it).


A cut-resistant glove can provide additional protection. See Tips below for more information.

, Use your non-dominant hand to hold the nearest leg of the mandoline., Grip the food with the hand guard. Push it down the runway, and the blades will cut one slice. Repeat this motion with even pressure to keep all slices the same thickness.


Mandolines with one horizontal blade may require a slow, sawing motion for soft foods like tomatoes.This shouldn't be a problem with V-shaped blades.

, If your mandoline has a knob on the side, it's easy to adjust. Just turn the knob to raise or lower the blade, and the mandoline will slice to a different thickness. Most mandolines can cut anything from French fries to paper-thin gratins and garnishes.


The knob usually has a thickness label. This isn't perfect, since the amount of pressure you use affects thickness, but it doesn't need to be perfect for most recipes.
Some models use a lever instead, but be careful — the lever could enable other features instead, as described below.

, Some models come with several different blade attachments instead of an adjustment knob. To change slice thickness or switch to a special cut (julienne, crinkle, or waffle), you'll need to swap in a new blade. This can be quite dangerous. We strongly recommend you check your owner's manual, since every model has its own safety and handling instructions.


Some mandoline blades are accessible from the underside. Others have a hinge that swings open to reveal the blade underside. You then pop out the blade from its base and insert the new blade into its slot.
Some models have one fixed blade, and multiple plastic runway attachments. These are much easier to switch in and out.

, The most common of these is an extra blade to julienne the food into thin strips, crinkle cut it, or perform another specialty cut. This may be built-in and raised by a lever on the underside of the device. If separate from the body of the mandoline, you typically hold it by the handle and insert it into the mandoline from the side.


Be very careful when looking for this lever. On some models you can cut yourself on the underside of the blade.Julienning is often difficult on a mandoline, especially with hard vegetables. Some chefs prefer to slice the ingredient as usual, then julienne the slices by hand.

, If you used an extra blade feature (such as for julienning), return it to its original hidden position. If your main blade is adjustable, set it to its lowest position.

, Wipe slowly from the base of the blade to the tip, to reduce the chance of cutting yourself. Once any food scraps or stains are gone, rinse off the soap under running water.

, Put it on the rack to air dry, or dry it carefully with a towel. Storing the mandoline while wet can lead to rust.

, Mandolines are significantly more dangerous than knives. Never leave them somewhere a child could reach.


Ideally, keep your mandoline in a labeled container. Never place it loose in a drawer or on a high shelf where someone might put their hand without looking.

, An occasional deep clean is a good idea if you use your mandoline often. Most plastic mandolines and some stainless steel mandolines can be run through the dishwasher, but hand washing is gentler on the blades.When washing by hand, handle with caution and consider wearing cut-resistant gloves.

Choose a bread knife with a serrated edge.,
Place your bread roll flat on a cutting board.,
Place your free hand on top of the bread roll to hold it steady.,
Place your knife against the side of the roll.,
Saw back and forth across the bread roll.",How to Slice Bread2," The deeper the serrated edge is, the better; a shallow edge won't cut as well. Also, try to find a knife where the blade extends all the way through the handle. If the blade only goes partway into the handle, your knife won't have enough support.

Your knife can have a jagged or a wavy serrated edge. Choose one that is easiest for you to cut with.

, Make sure that the cutting board is big enough to fit the entire bread roll. This will work for rolls, buns, bagels, English muffins, and baguettes.

, If you are working with a smaller piece of bread, such as a bagel or an English muffin, then you can use your fingertips., The serrated edge should be touching the side of the roll. The flat side of the blade should be parallel to the cutting board. Try to position the knife right in the center.

, When you reach the end, you can flip the roll on it's side and continue sawing downward.


If you are cutting a baguette for a sandwich, consider stopping just short of the long end.. This way, you can open it up like a hot dog bun, and stuff it with sandwich goodies.

Carve the apple into four equal chunks.,
Remove the core.,
Slice the quarters into wedges.",How to Slice an Apple2," First, arrange the apple upright on a cutting board. Then, use a sharp knife to cut the fruit in half directly through the core. Finally, slice each of these halves in half along the stem axis. You should have four roughly-equal quarters.

, Use your knife to scoop out the seeded portion of each apple slice. To preserve as much as the apple as possible, carve out only the small crescent that encases the seeds. Compost the core, or dispose of it the garbage.For a slightly quicker method, simply slice off the edge of the apple quarter that includes the core. You might lose some edible apple this way, but you won't need to be so precise., Place the apple quarter skin-up on the cutting board. Then, slice or dice each apple quarter into pieces of your desired size and shape. For a snack-ready portion, try slicing each quarter into three wedges.Feel free to eat the apple quarters as they are. You have removed the core and the seeds, so the apple is perfectly edible in this form.

",How to Slice an Apple3," Hold the apple upside-down, and slice vertically through the fruit a few centimeters away from the core. Make two parallel cuts: one on each side of the core, so that the apple falls into three pieces.

, Make two more vertical cuts in the apple, equidistant from the core but perpendicular to the first two cuts. The apple should be sliced into a neat grid with nine clean pieces. The central piece is the core., The band should be tight enough to hold the apple solidly together. If the rubber band is loose, try double-wrapping it. Alternately, wrap the apple in saran wrap or anything else that will hold the pieces together.

, Now, you have an easy-to-eat apple snack that you can bring along with you on your daily journey. The band will hold the apple together without exposing the delicate insides to the air. This will keep the apple from browning.,"

","How to Shred Lettuce and Cabbage, Restaurant Style1"," Iceberg lettuce is usually served alongside dishes like enchiladas and on tostadas, while green cabbage is the base of many slaw salads.;
, The exterior leaves on lettuce and cabbage tend to get damaged. The head should get fresher as you go inward.








,, Pretend there is a nail on the cutting board and you are using the stalk as a hammer. Hit it with about that much force. This will break the stalk, and now the stalk will pull right out. Pull it out and throw it away in the compost.









Cabbage doesn't do so well with this method, so it will be much easier if you cut the head in half through the stalk to the top. Then cut the stalk out by cut along the outline of the shape of the thick wedges.

, Flip the head over so the hole from the stalk is facing the ceiling and chop the head in half vertically.








,, Chop vertically only and slowly turn the half-head until you have chopped it all. If you don't want long strips, simply cut the pile in half horizontally. You can also lay the flat side down on your cutting surface and cut strips to desired thickness.

Enjoy!",How to Slice a Tomato1," Make sure that the stem part is facing upwards. This will make coring the tomato easier.;
, If you’re working with large roma or beefsteak tomatoes, you’ll have to remove the core before slicing. If you’re working with small cherry or grape tomatoes, this step is unnecessary and you can skip ahead to the next step.


Place your thumb right below the edge of a knife, preferable a small pairing knife.
Use your non-cutting hand to grab the base of the tomato, and stabilize your hand against the cutting board.
Place your knife’s tip slightly to the side of the core.
Push your knife into the tomato about 1/4”-1/2” deep.
Cut out a small circle by twisting your knife. Pull up to remove the core.

, Now that the core is removed, your tomato will have a flatter top. Turn your tomato upside down so that it faces the cutting board and gives you a stable base.

, Using a sharp chef's knife or a serrated knife, make one long cut from top to the bottom so that your tomato is divided into two even hemispheres. This will make slicing much easier, but if you want whole tomato slices, you can omit this step and skip ahead to the slicing part.

, Place the cut side down, facing the cutting board.

, The following steps will help you make safe, even cuts across your tomato. If you are slicing a whole tomato, you can still follow the same steps.


Place your non-cutting hand on the left side of the tomato (if you are cutting with your right hand). Curl up your fingers into a claw shape and press your fingers tips lightly on the tomato. This type of grip helps to stabilize the tomato and prevent you from cutting yourself.
Place the tip of the knife on the cutting board behind the right most side of the tomato.
Keeping the knife tip on the cutting board, drag your knife straight down and through the tomato. A sharp knife will make cutting easier.
Once you are through to the other side, lift up the knife.
Reposition your knife at the top of the tomato, about 1/4-1/2” to the left of your last cut, depending on how thick you want your slices.
Repeat the same dragging motion and continue across the tomato.
Repeat for the second tomato half.

, Now you have a perfectly sliced tomato for salads, sandwiches, or just as-is.

Serve your bread slices.",How to Slice Bread3," Try to find one that has a deep, serrated edge. A knife with a shallower edge may not cut as well. Also, try to find a bread knife whose blade goes all the way through the handle. It will give you the best support. A bread knife whose blade only extends partway into the handle will not give you enough support.

Some people find that knives with wavy edges are easier to use than knives with jagged edges.

, If your cutting board is not long enough, then place part of the baguette on the board. As you continue to slice it, you will scoop the sliced parts off to the side and push the baguette further up onto the board.

, Start by going into the baguette at a slight angle, close to the heel. Once the knife pierces the crust, position the knife so that the jagged blade is parallel to the cutting board.


For thin slices, try cutting them ¼ to ½ inch (0.65 to 1.27 centimeters).
For thicker slices, try cutting them 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) tick.

, Place a slice cut-side-down onto the cutting board. Cut the slice straight down the middle so that you end up with two half-circles. Repeat this for the rest of the thick slices.


If the bread is very sturdy, you can set it down on the cutting board and cut horizontally into it, with the flat side of the blade parallel to the cutting board.
You can also use this technique for ciabatta bread.

, Top the thin slices with ham, salami, or thin slices of cheese. Serve the thicker, half-circle slices with dips or olive oil.

Let cool before serving.",How to Score a Ham," First, place the raw ham on a cutting board. Make sure that it sits squarely and securely on the board, so that it won't rock around while you cut. Find a sharp, clean chef's knife.;
, Use your knife to make shallow, diagonal cuts across the ham. Each score should be about 1/3"" deep. The scores should extend all the way from top to bottom on each side of the ham. Leave about one inch between cuts.


You may score the ham while it is raw, right before you cook, or you may score it at the end of the baking time – just before you add the glaze.There is no definitive right or wrong way to do this.

, Now, score the ham in the opposite direction. Make cuts of the same depth and spacing, but perpendicular to the original set of scores. Slice a latticework of diamonds along the surface of the ham., It is common to poke small cloves into the ham for added flavor and aesthetic. Put one clove in the center of each latticework diamond. It is usually easiest to insert the cloves where the scores intersect., For a simple glaze recipe, heat 1/4 cup dark corn syrup, 2/3 cup butter, and 2 cups of honey in the top half of a double boiler.Keep the glaze warm while the ham is baking.

, Bake the ham at 325°F for one hour and 25 minutes. Every 10-15 minutes, remove the ham from the oven and brush the glaze liberally over the surface. Then, in the last five minutes of baking, turn on the broiler to caramelize the glaze.Wait for the ham to reach an internal temperature of 160° F before you add the glaze. Make sure that it is cooked fully through.Alternately, wait to add the glaze until the last 20-30 minutes of cooking. Then, bake at a steady temperature until the glaze begins to caramelize and turn brown.Be generous with the glaze. Make sure that the sauce spills into all of the scored grooves so that the interior fat of the ham absorbs the flavor.

, Remove the ham from the oven and let it sit at room temperature for several minutes. Serve the scored, glazed ham by slicing along the scores.

Enjoy!",How to Slice a Tomato2," Mandolines are a staple cutting tool for professionals chefs and at-home meal makers alike and are handy for making lots of uniform cuts quickly. Follow the manufacture’s setup instructions so that your mandoline is standing upright on your cutting board. , This will determine the thickness of your tomato slices.


Depending on the make and model of your mandoline, you can dial-in or adjust your blade's distance from the mandoline's body to make thicker or thinner slices.
Make sure your blades are sharp -- this will help you make really thin slices without seizing up the machine or ripping the tomato.

, Mandolines almost always come with a hand-guard to hold the object you're planning to cut.


Some models have spikes inside the holder to help secure slippery items like tomatoes.
Mandoline blades can be very sharp and can slice neatly into exposed fingertips, so always use the hand-guard to protect yourself!

, The mandoline is going to do most of this for you.


Start at the top of the mandoline body and slide the tomato and hand-guard down and over the blades.
Try using a slight zig-zag motion to move over the blades; this will help to cut through the tomato's skin and not squish it.
Return to the top and drag down again to create another slice. Keep repeating this step until you reach the end of your tomato.

, Your slices will all be same thickness, which is especially great for even cooking times and ensuring everything is cooked.

, Your slicer will make quick work of your tomato, slicing the whole thing all at once!


Hold the tomato slicer handle in your dominate cutting hand, with the sharp end of the blades facing the tomato. For extra leverage and stability, place your pointer finger on top of the handle where it intersects with the slicer's frame.
Use a sawing motion to work the slicer's blades through the tomato.
When you get about halfway through the tomato, move your non-cutting stabilizing hand to the top of the tomato so that it's not in the way of the blades. You don't want to cut yourself!
Keep sawing back and forth through the tomato until you reach the cutting board.

, Once your reach the cutting board, you should have a perfectly sliced tomato.

Wash the lettuce.,
Remove the tip of the lettuce head.,
Cut the head of lettuce in half.,
Cut the head into quarters.,
Shred the quarter head into thin slices.,
Shred another quarter, if needed.",How to Shred Lettuce1," To be sure you aren't ingesting any dirt or pesticides, always wash produce before you prepare it. If the lettuce is marked “ready-to-eat,” the FDA has certified that it is clean and can be eaten as it is, but some experts recommend washing it again when you get home.Remove the outer layers of leaves, until you get to a layer where you can't see any visible dirt or wilted edges.
Grasp the entire head of lettuce and run it under running water.
Gently scrub the exterior of the lettuce with your fingers to remove any traces of dirt or pesticides.
Do not soak your lettuce in a sink filled with water – this will not remove the dirt.;
, The stalk of the lettuce tends to be tough and can have a bitter taste. Remove the pale, hard tip of the head and discard it.Also discard any of the outer leaves that appear wilted or discolored.

, Put the lettuce on a clean chopping board and use a sharp kitchen knife to cut the head in half, through the root (or stalk).A classic chef's knife with an 8 to 10 inch (20 – 25 cm) blade is recommended for chopping lettuce and most other vegetables.

, Set each half of the lettuce, cut side down, on the cutting board. Slice each half in half, through the root (stalk)., Place the lettuce quarter-section on the cutting board with the outer leaves against the board and the cut edges facing up.


Position the knife at the far, right edge of the lettuce and begin cutting with a back and forth sawing motion until you reach the cutting board.
Move over approximately 1/4-inch and begin sawing again.
The last piece of the head segment may be too small to slice safely. Reposition the small piece on the cutting board so that it lays flat, and finish slicing.

, Move onto the other half of the lettuce if a lot of shredded lettuce is desired.


Slice only what you will need for your meal, and return the remaining uncut portions of lettuce to the refrigerator. Shredded lettuce will brown and wilt more quickly than lettuce that is left intact.

Slice a thin piece of peel from both the top and bottom.,
Cut along the contour of the grapefruit.,
Continue peeling the grapefruit.,
Clean any remaining pith.",How to Segment a Grapefruit1," The first step in supreming a grapefruit is to remove the peel. Cut off the top and the bottom of the grapefruit, exposing the flesh of the fruit. This will provide you with a flat side to rest the grapefruit on while you cut it. You will be less likely to cut yourself with a flat side providing stability.








”Supreme” is the culinary term used to describe the act of cutting off the peel of a grapefruit and removing the segmented flesh from the bitter pith and membrane.;
, Place the grapefruit on one of the flat ends you cut. With a sharp knife, slice off the peel and pith of the grapefruit, starting from the top and moving your knife to the bottom. Follow the natural curve of the grapefruit. Be sure to avoid cutting off too much of the red flesh.








The pith is the white spongy material between the peel and the red flesh of the grapefruit.

, Remove the peel and pith, turning the grapefruit after every slice. Depending on the size of your knife, this may take between six and eight slices. Once the peel and pith have been completely removed, you may discard them.








Consider composting the peel and pith.

, There may be a few small pieces of pith left on the grapefruit once you have peeled it. Go back and shave off these remaining pieces. Grapefruit pith is quite bitter and you will want to avoid eating it."

Prepare your chicken.,
Get the right mixer.,
Cut the chicken pieces in half.While it isn’t absolutely necessary, the mixer will be able to shred the chicken more easily if it is in smaller pieces.,
Turn the mixer on.",How to Shred Chicken with a Stand Mixer1," Shredding the chicken with a mixer is only possible if it’s warm.There are many ways of preparing chicken for shredding. For instance, you could bake it in the oven at a temperature of 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 Celsius) for about 30 to 40 minutes.If you don’t want to cook your chicken in the oven, try boiling it. Finally, you could pan-simmer your chicken on the range in oil.


To boil the chicken, just drop the chicken into water and heat to boiling. Cover, reduce heat to low, and wait 90 minutes. To pan-simmer your chicken, just place it in oil at a medium-high temperature for one minute, flip it, and reduce the temperature to low. Cover and let it simmer about 10 minutes.
No matter what method you choose, ensure you follow proper safety protocols. For instance, always use antibacterial soap to clean the cutting boards and other surfaces that may have come into contact with the raw chicken, and wash your hands thoroughly after preparing your chicken.
Choose the right kind of chicken. Shredding chicken in a stand mixer requires that it is free of bones. Bone-free chicken breasts or thighs are the best option for shredding chicken in a stand mixer.;
, Not all stand mixers are created equal. The overwhelming choice for best mixer to shred chicken is the KitchenAid stand mixer.While other stand mixers might be able to do the job, the KitchenAid seems to be the tried and true favorite.

, Cutting the chicken breast or thigh in half is a good way to help the shredding process along without investing too much time into slicing and dicing the meat.

, Place the warm chicken in the mixing bowl. Snap the paddle attachment into the mixing arm. Set the mixer to a low setting (setting number 2), then increase the speed to a medium-high setting (somewhere around number 4-6) once the chicken starts to break apart.Mix for about one minute, until all the chicken is finely shredded.

Divide each leg into a drumstick and thigh piece.,
Remove the breasts, keeping the wings attached.,
Cut through the wing joint to separate each breast and wing.",How to Quarter a Chicken," Most commercial chickens comes in tight plastic wrap, which you'll need to pierce with a knife and drain into the sink. Remove the chicken from the package the discard the plastic.









The giblets are usually in the cavity of the chicken, either in a small plastic bag or loosely packed. Locate them and remove them from the chicken. You can use these to create a hearty chicken stock, or discard them.
Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to wash the raw chicken before preparing it. Rinsing the bird in water can spread any bacteria found on it around your clean kitchen, increasing the risk of illness. Cooking the chicken to a temperature of 165 °F (74 °C) is the surest way to kill any bacteria found on it. As long as you cook it properly, you don't need to rinse it.;
, Chop up the chicken on a clean and sturdy cutting surface designated for meat. Make sure you thoroughly clean the surface and the kitchen knife before reusing, or cutting anything else on it.








, Because a quartering requires that you cut through bone, it's important to use a sturdy kitchen knife that'll allow you to do the job. A good chef's knife or a cleaver is essential to quartering chicken. Sharpen your kitchen knife well before you start, or consider having it sharpened.








, Slice along each leg joint using a butcher’s knife, cutting through the skin. This should loosen but not completely remove the leg.









Pull the legs away from the body, rotating the drumstick until the ball joint of the leg pops out, then make another cut below the ball joints to completely remove each leg and thigh.

, Place the chicken leg on a cutting board with the skin side down. Use a butcher’s knife to find the notch at the top of the drumstick where it meets the thigh and cut between them to separate.









Alternatively, you can leave the leg and thigh together for a larger piece if you wish.

, Position the chicken breast-side down so the neck cavity is nearest to you. Slice along one side of the chicken’s backbone toward the neck cavity, using your kitchen knife or kitchen shears to cut through the ribs. Then, slice through the breast bone, separating the two halts of the chicken.









Remove excess fat and bone by cutting through the point at which the rib bones meet the breast meat, separating the back bones and discarding them, or using them for stock. Also remove the breast bone and the cartilage that connects them.Alternatively, some find it much easier to start with the chicken breast-up. With your finger, press into the center of the breast to find the hard cartilage and insert the knife to one side of it. Use the point of your knife to start, and then the flat of it to break through the front, separating the halves of the chicken in much the same way, then removing the excess rib bone you don't want.

, Keep the edge of your knife tight into the body and pull the wing joint back to expose the seam, then insert your knife and remove the wing."

, Set your knife on the edge of the head and slice straight through it, to create thin slices. Cut the lettuce carefully, using long, firm strokes.

, Continue slicing until you reach the pale center of the head of lettuce. Stop slicing when you reach the core of the lettuce.

, Turn the head around and continue slicing on the other side until you reach the core. Stop cutting when you reach the core of the lettuce head.

, Lay the head of lettuce on its side and slice the top of the lettuce from the core, using a sharp chef's knife. Slice off any remaining green leaves, then remove the pale center of the lettuce and discard it.

, Take the pieces of lettuce that you just sliced, and fan them out on the cutting board. Spread the slices out so that they cover the entire surface of the board.

, Use a sharp chef's knife to cut through the lettuce in close rows, moving from left to right across the board. You now have a pile of lettuce strips.

, Turn the cutting board 90 degrees and cut through the lettuce in close rows from the new direction. This will result in a pile of small pieces of lettuce, like the leaves in a chopped salad.

, If you want even smaller pieces, turn the cutting board 90 degrees and slice through the pieces again. Continue turning and slicing the lettuce until it is as finely shredded and diced as you like.

”Supreme” is the culinary term for sectioning a grapefruit.
If you decide to hold the grapefruit, be sure to place a bowl under your hand to catch any juices that might fall.

, With a paring knife, make a cut along the inside of the white membrane that runs between the grapefruit segments. Follow this membrane until you reach the center. However, avoid cutting into the white membrane itself, which can be tough and difficult to eat.








Be sure to avoid cutting too hard and slicing into your hand.

, Perform this process again and cut along the membrane found on the other side of the segment. Once your knife has reached the center of the fruit, the V-shaped segment will be free.








Try not to push too hard while cutting the grapefruit. This could cause you to slice your hand.

, Cut around the grapefruit until you have removed all the segments. Once completed, your bowl should be full of juice and segmented slices.







, Once you have cut all of the slices from the grapefruit, you will be left with the remaining membrane material. If you want to keep any grapefruit juice, squeeze the remaining liquid from the membrane into a bowl. Then, dispose of the membrane in your garbage or compost.

Remove the chicken in the amount you plan on using and let it thaw for a few hours before using.

, Dice a large onion into large chunks. Sprinkle four pounds of chicken with one tablespoon of garlic herbal seasoning, or to taste. Place the onion in the bottom of your slow cooker crock and put the chicken on top. Set the cooker to high for two to three hours, or to low for four to five hours. When the time is up, remove the chicken and serve your tender, flavorful shredded chicken with a side of steamed broccoli and rice.

Tear the meat into small pieces.Unlike shredding chicken in a stand mixer, other methods of shredding chicken require giving the chicken a head start on getting shredded.,
Shred the chicken with a fork.On a plate or in a bowl, pierce a piece of boneless chicken with two forks.,
Shred chicken with a hand mixer.",How to Shred Chicken with a Stand Mixer3," Tear or cut the meat up into pieces no bigger than an inch on any side.


Like shredding chicken with a stand mixer, other methods of shredding chicken require that they are free of bones.

, Both forks should have their prongs facing in a downward curve. Press the prongs of one fork into the center of the chicken and apply a firm downward pressure. With another fork, pierce the chicken near the place where the prongs of the first fork penetrated. Then, pull the second fork away from the first in a straight line.


Don’t simply remove it at the same angle you entered the chicken. Rather, pull straight away relative to the plane of the bowl or plate the chicken is on. By pulling the second fork away from the other fork, a significant portion of the chicken meat should come away with it.
You might notice the meat is stringy and breaks into thin strips. This is normal.
Pierce the chicken again with the second fork and continue to tear away chicken meat. When you’ve torn up most or all of one side of a piece of chicken, remove the first fork you’re using to anchor the chicken in place and pierce the new center of the piece of chicken you’re shredding.
Continue in this way until all the chicken is shredded.

, Place your chicken pieces into a sturdy pyrex or glass mixing bowl. Most mixing bowls can accommodate up to two chicken breasts or thighs.Place the prongs of your mixer into the bowl. Turn the mixer on a low setting. Use one hand to grip the bowl and one hand to move the mixer around. Move the mixer around the bowl until the chicken is fully shredded (usually about 60 seconds or less).


Keep the mixing paddles in the bowl while they’re moving, otherwise you’ll end up flinging chicken all over your kitchen.
When your chicken is shredded, turn the mixer off and remove it from the bowl.
If you have more than two pieces of chicken, shred them in batches. For instance, shred two piece of chicken, then remove them onto a plate or bowl. Then drop two more pieces of hand-torn chicken into the mixing bowl and shred again.

Know that whole squid are cheaper and tastier than pre-cut calamari.,

Chop the head off the tentacles by cutting beneath the eyes.,
Remove the beak from the tentacles by pinching it out from the center.,
Pull off the two fins.,
Pull out the hard piece of cartilage, or quill from inside the body of the squid.,
Use the back of your knife to squeeze any remaining viscera out of the squid body.,
Remove the membrane.,
Cut the mantle into your desired shape.",How to Cook Squid1," There are a lot of parts to a squid that are thrown out when a squid is pre-prepared. It may seem gross at first, but prepping a whole squid requires nothing but a sharp knife and a willingness to get your hands dirty., This is probably the grossest part of the whole process, and you get it done first. Hold the squid firmly by the body, or mantle. Squeeze gently above the eyes and pull towards the tentacles so that you have two parts -- the head and tentacles and the mantle.


This may get messy, so do it over the sink when possible., Discard the eyes and head, keeping the tentacles for later. If you want to save the ink, which is great in stews or pasta, it is attached above the head and is a silvery sack with black liquid inside. Cut it away and drain the ink into a bowl to use later., The hard mouth of the squid sits in the middle of the tentacle cluster. Feel around for a small, seed like beak at the base of the tentacles. It can be popped out by squeezing out in the direction of the tentacles.


Cut any extra long tentacles back so that they are all roughly even length and then set the tentacles aside-- they are ready to cook and serve.

, You can trim them back with a knife as well, but pulling them off will weaken the skin, which you need to remove later. Pull back the fins (they look like wings on the body) then pinch them with your thumb and forefinger until have a good grip. You can then easily pull them off the body of the squid.

, You should be able to feel it easily in the mantle of the squid along the belly, and it will slide out easily. It may break inside the squid, so make sure to feel for any hard bits before you begin cooking.

, Starting at the tip, use the back of your knife to push the remaining gunk out of the mantle. If you're feeling adventurous, it is often easier to just reach in with your hands or a spoon and simply scoop it all out., The membrane is the gel-like, purple skin covering the squid. Cut the tip off the mantle and use it to get some skin loose, then pull it away. If you are having trouble, scrape the blade of the knife at an angle along the skin, almost like you were gently whittling. Rinse the squid in cold water when you're done.

, If you want calamari, cut the mantle horizontally so that you have rings of squid. For most other servings, cut along one edge of the squid to open it up into a flat piece and then cut into squares.You can also score the fish for faster cooking. Make small slices halfway into the flesh with your knife at an angle so that the squid is ridged."

Scrub the feet clean.,
Burn off the hairs.Light a small, unscented tealight candle.,
Shave or pluck any remaining hairs.",How to Cook Pig Feet1," Rinse the pig feet under cool, running water. Use a vegetable brush to scrub away any dirt and debris.


Dry the clean pig feet with paper towels before continuing.

, Carefully hold each pig foot over the flame of the candle, rotating it periodically, to burn off as many hairs as possible.


If you have a gas stove, you can turn on one stove eye to low heat and use the stove flame instead of a candle.
It's important to use relatively low heat regardless of the method you choose. Using high heat or a large flame can result in accidental burns. To the same end, you should also avoid holding your hand too close to the flame while removing the hairs.

, Examine the pig feet. Use a new, disposable razor or clean pair of tweezers to remove any hairs you couldn't burn off.


The razor will be quicker but will only remove hair from the surface of the foot. The tweezers will be able to remove the entire hair, however, even the portion sitting beneath the skin.
Once you finish removing the hairs, the pig feet should be ready to use in any recipe.

Pat your rings of squid dry with a paper towel.,
Consider soaking the rings in a buttermilk bath for tenderness and richer flavor.,

Coat the rings of calamari in the flour mixture.,
Heat up 1/2"" oil to medium-high heat on the stove top.,
Cook the calamari in small batches until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes.",How to Cook Squid2," Calamari requires thin rings of squid. If you start with the body of the squid, simply pat it dry and then cut horizontally across the body with a sharp knife -- turning the tube of seafood into 1/2"" rings for cooking.


1 lb of fresh squid usually equals 1/2 lb of calamari, which is generally enough for one person.

, This will make a heavenly fried calamari, but you can skip the step if you don't have time. To make your own buttermilk mixture, if you don't have any handy:


Mix 2 cups of milk with the juice of one large lemon. You can also add a dash of hot sauce too for flavor.
Let the mixture sit for 4-5 minutes. You should see it thickening.
Soak the calamari rings in the buttermilk mixture for 3-4 hours before moving on. When ready, remove the rings and drain any excess liquid., You can also add any other spices you desire, such as a teaspoon of paprika, chili powder, or cayenne. Whisk together well.

, Coat the rings so that each of them is completely covered in flower. You may need to work in small batches, and you'll likely need to add more flour if you start running out.

, You may need 1-2 cups of vegetable oil in order to have enough, as it should almost coat the rings when they cook. If you have a thermometer, get the oil up to 360℉. You can also use a deep-fryer set to 360℉. If you don't have a thermometer, wait until the oil is shimmering throughout.

, Flip the rings once as they cook, removing them when the flesh underneath the breading is no longer shiny or translucent. Make sure you don't crowd the pan, adding only enough pieces to fill the bottom without touching or overlapping. Adding too much will drastically lower the temperature of the oil, leading to greasy, unappealing calamari.If you want crispier calamari with a smoother inside, heat the oil to 400℉ and cook the squid for no more than a minute or a minute and a half.

, You want the oil to be hot so that the squid cooks quickly. Leaving the meat in the oil for too long will make it tough and rubbery.

, Aromatics are simply small vegetables and herbs that soften under heat and are used in cuisines worldwide. Toss them in the hot oil and give them a few minutes to get tender before moving on. Some good ideas (listed per squid being cooked) include:


1-2 glove garlic, minced.
1/4 cup diced white onions.
1/3 cup diced chili peppers., You do not want to fill the pan, or you'll lower the temperature too fast and ruin the cooking process. Put enough pieces in so that they have room to move and stir frequently. If you have a large sauce-pan, 1 whole squid should be perfect.

, You only want the squid to cook until it is white and no longer translucent (partially see-through). Then, add your spices and mix everything up well before serving immediately. You can mix it into pasta or simply eat it as is. Try out:

Serve warm.",How to Cook Pig Feet2," Place the pig's feet, celery, onion, garlic, bay leaves, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and white vinegar in a large stockpot or Dutch oven.


Wash the pig feet and remove the hairs before placing them in the pot.
Use a durable mixing spoon to toss the ingredients together after combining them.;
, Pour enough water into the stockpot to cover the pig feet by at least 2 inches (5 cm). Set the stockpot on the stove over medium-high heat.Allow the water to reach a rolling boil over medium-high heat.

, Once the water reaches a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low or low, dropping the water to a steady simmer. Cover and cook the pig feet until the meat becomes tender.


Watch the pig feet as they simmer. Periodically stir the contents of the stockpot and skim away any foam that develops along the surface.
When ready, the pork should be so tender that it nearly falls off the bone., Shortly before serving the pig feet, pour the barbecue sauce into a separate saucepan and heat it gently over medium-low to medium-heat.


You should heat the sauce through so that's slightly warm. A few bubbles are okay, but do not bring the sauce to a full boil.
Ideally, you should start heating the barbecue sauce within the final 10 minutes of cooking time for the pig feet. If you are unable to time it precisely, you can wait until the pig feet are finished cooking before heating the sauce; remove the pig feet from the heat of the stove beforehand to prevent them from overcooking.

, Remove the pig feet from the cooking water using a slotted spoon. Toss each foot into the warm barbecue sauce and turn to coat.


If the pan of sauce is large enough, coat all the pig feet at once. Otherwise, coat each pig foot individually and transfer them to a serving platter when done.

, Serve the pig feet immediately to enjoy the best flavor. If desired, you can serve additional barbecue sauce on the side.

Stir-fry the aromatic ingredients.Add the sliced ginger, sliced garlic, and scallion to the oil.,
Add the pig feet and remaining ingredients.,
Simmer until tender.,
Serve warm.",How to Cook Pig Feet3," Place the pig feet in a stockpot and cover them with water. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, and cook the pig feet for about 3 minutes.


You should clean the pig feet and remove any hairs before completing this step.
Parboiling the pig feet can help remove some of the odd flavor, thereby preventing it from leeching into the braising liquid you'll use during the primary portion of the cooking process.

, After parboiling the pig feet, remove them from the water using a slotted spoon. Set them aside for now.


Discard the cooking water. You should not reuse this water in later steps calling for additional water.

, Pour the cooking oil into a large, deep wok. Warm it on the stove for about 1 minute over medium-high heat.


The oil should become glossier and thinner, making it easy to spread it over the bottom of the pan.
Note that you could use a Dutch oven or stockpot if you do not have a deep wok.

, Cook for 1 minute, stirring frequently, then add the chili peppers, star anise, and cloves. Stir-fry for an additional 2 minutes.


Stir frequently to prevent any of the ingredients from burning. You only need to cook them long enough to release the scent and flavor from each ingredient.
Note that the amount of chili peppers should vary depending on personal taste. Use 3 dried chili peppers if you prefer mild to moderate heat or 5 dried chili peppers if you enjoy strong heat.

, Add the drained pig feet, soy sauce, rice wine, sugar, and salt to the wok. Pour in enough water to just barely cover the pig feet.


Allow the braising broth to reach a rolling boil, stirring lightly as it heats up.

, Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. Simmer the pig feet for about 2 hours, or until the meat is tender enough to nearly fall off the bone.Stir the contents of the pot every 10 to 15 to prevent the pig feet from burning and sticking to the bottom.
The sauce will eventually thicken. If this happens while the pig feet still seem tough, add more water 1 cup (250 ml) at a time and continue cooking.
If the sauce still seems thin once the pig feet are done, remove the lid and increase the heat to medium. Continue boiling until the sauce reduces and thickens.

, Transfer the finished pig feet and sauce to individual serving dishes and enjoy them while they're still hot.

Clean the pig feet and remove any hairs before beginning.
Parboiling the pig feet in this manner should help reduce any strange aftertaste.

, Drain the water from the pig feet, then return the pig feet to the pan. Add enough fresh water to cover the pig feet by 1 or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm), and set the pan back on the stove over medium-high heat.

, Add the garlic, salt, and pepper to the water as it heats. Allow the water to reach a rolling boil.


You should notice foam gathering at the surface of the water once it boils. Remove this foam with a spoon before continuing.

, Reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan. Allow the pig feet to simmer for 3 to 4 hours, or until the meat is tender enough to fall off the bones.


You should continue to periodically skim off any foam that develops at the surface of the cooking broth. When the pig feet are ready, the broth should also be fairly clear.

, Pour the contents of the saucepan into four individual serving dishes. Use tongs to carefully remove the bones from the meat as you divide it amongst the dishes.Note that each dish should contain an equal amount of pork and broth.
Allow the dishes to sit out and cool down to room temperature before continuing to the next step.

, Place the dishes of pig feet into a refrigerator. Chill for at least 2 hours, or until the mixture solidifies into a jelly-like consistency.


The bones, connective tissue, and skin break down during the cooking process, and the by-products of these elements reduce down into a natural gelatin.
The length of refrigeration may vary depending on how much water you used during the cooking process.

, Remove the jellied pig feet from the refrigerator and enjoy it cold. You can serve each portion in its molding dish or cut each portion into slices before serving it.

Bring your meat to room temperature.,
Truss the meat (optional).,
Season the meat.,
Prep the vegetables.,
Break up the garlic.,
Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).

,
Assemble the roasting tray.,
Place the tray in the oven and roast for 1/2 hour.,
Turn down the temperature to 225°F (107°C) and continue roasting.,
Check the beef with a meat thermometer.,
Let the meat rest.,
Make gravy while it rests.,
Arrange the roast and vegetables on a platter.",How to Cook Roast Beef," Removing your meat from the refrigerator a half hour before you start the roasting process will ensure that the beef cooks evenly and comes out to the right texture. If you place it in the oven while it's still cold, the cooking time will be thrown off, and the meat could come out either undercooked or tough.


A note about your meat: make sure you get rump roast, round roast, or sirloin - one of the cheaper cuts. Using the slow roasting method for prime cuts of beef doesn't work as well, since prime cuts are more tender. If you want to cook a prime cut of beef, see How to Cook a Prime Rib Roast.
Make sure the beef you get is boneless, and check for a dark pink, springy surface and plenty of marbling. Depending on the cut you get, it might have a cap of fat on top.;
, If you want your roast to come out in a pretty, symmetrical shape, you can truss it before you roast it. You can either ask your butcher to truss the roast for you or do it yourself using kitchen twine. Simply cut a few lengths of twine and tie them around the beef at intervals down its length. You can skip this step if you don't mind how your beef will look on the serving platter.

, Rub it all over with olive oil, then sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper on all sides. Use your hands to pat the seasoning into the meat. If you'd like, add other seasonings like garlic powder or ancho chile pepper - however, using this roasting method, the beef will be quite flavorful without these extra spices.


Seasoning all sides will ensure even cooking and flavoring in the final product when you roast red meat. Seasoning all over will also help seal in the meat's juices.

, If you plan to serve roasted vegetables as well, prep them now. Peel the carrots and chop them into bite-sized pieces. Peel the parsnips and do the same. Peel the onion and roughly chop it. You can add other vegetables to your roast, like sweet potatoes, squash, or anything else that's in season. If all you want is the beef, skip this step.

, Break apart the bulb and place the individual cloves on a cutting board. Don't peel the garlic, since that would cause it to cook too quickly. Simply break it up, and at the end of the roasting process you'll have delectable roasted garlic to go with your beef.

,, If you're using vegetables, pile them into your roasting tray, then spread them out to make an even layer. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and drizzle with a bit of olive oil. Lay out the garlic in an even layer. Place the beef on top of the vegetables.If you're not using vegetables, simply place the beef in the roasting tray and arrange the garlic cloves around it.
In place of a roasting tray, you can use a roasting pan with higher sides and a roasting rack inside it when cooking beef roasts. The rack holds the meat away from accumulating juices in the bottom of the pan, allowing it to cook more evenly on all sides, because heat can circulate evenly throughout the pan and around the beef.

, For the first half hour, the beef will cook at a higher temperature, which will give the outside of the beef a good sear. Make sure you remember to come back to the oven after 1/2 hour.

, The beef will finish cooking at this consistent temperature until finished. Depending on the shape and cut of your beef, it could take 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, so be ready to monitor it's progress.

, Use a meat thermometer or instant food thermometer to check the internal temperature of the roasting beef. Push the thermometer halfway into the center of the roast so its tip is approximately in the middle of the cut of beef, being careful not to let the thermometer touch the hot pan. The roast is ready when it reaches an internal temperature of 140°F (60°C).If you like your beef on the slightly rarer side, you can take it out when the temperature reaches 135°F (57°C).

, Remove the roast from the oven once it has reached the desired temperature, tent a piece of aluminum foil over it to retain the heat and let the roasted beef rest for 15 to 20 minutes. This resting period allows the juices to redistribute themselves in the meat, which will keep them in the meat once you carve it instead of running out onto your cutting board. This will keep the roast flavorful and juicy.

, Spoon 3 tablespoons of the drippings in to a small saucepan, and place it on the stove over medium heat. When it's hot, stir in a teaspoon of cornstarch or flour, and stir to thicken. You can thin it out with water, red wine, beef stock or beer, or make it richer by adding butter. Keep stirring until it reaches the desired consistency, then pour into a gravy dish., Place the roast in the middle of a serving platter and arrange the vegetables and garlic around it. When you're ready to serve, slice the meat against the grain in 1⁄4 to 1⁄4 inch (0.6 to 0.6 cm) slices. Serve with gravy.

Open the coddler.,
Serve the egg.",How to Coddle an Egg1," Remove the eggs from the refrigerator and let them sit out on your counter for about 30 minutes, or until they drop to room temperature.


The cooking times will change if you use cold eggs, and you will have no way of knowing whether or not the eggs have coddled correctly until you crack one open. As a general rule, though, add another 1 to 2 minutes of cooking time if using cold eggs instead of room temperature eggs.;
, Fill a wide saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water. Set the saucepan on the stove and heat on medium-high until the water begins to boil.


You'll only want to use a little water. When you place the coddler inside, the water level should not reach above the halfway point of the coddler body. Do not fully submerge the coddler in water.
To prevent the egg coddler from sliding around, line the bottom of the saucepan with a kitchen towel., Coat the inside of the egg coddler with nonstick cooking spray, butter, or cooking oil. Grease the inside of the metal lid, as well.


Complete this step simultaneously with the previous step. In other words, you should prepare the egg coddler and the egg while the water is still working up to a boil, not after the water has already reached a boil.
Use clean fingers or a clean paper towel to spread the grease on all inner sides of the coddler. The sides need to be well greased, but you should not have enough excess to form a puddle at the bottom of the coddler.

, Both the white and yolk of the egg should be broken directly into the coddler. Add any salt and pepper you want to the raw egg, as well.


The number of eggs you should use will depend on the size of your coddler. Small egg coddlers only fit one egg, while large egg coddlers can fit two eggs.
You can add other ingredients and seasonings, as well. Consider sprinkling in a look grated cheese, fresh herbs, crumbled bacon, or 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) heavy cream.

, Loosely turn the lid on top of the egg coddler to secure it in place.


The lid needs to be tight enough to prevent water or steam from seeping into the inner coddler, but it does not need to be extremely tight. A loose turn is usually enough.

, Carefully lower the egg coddler into the boiling water. Allow the egg to cook for 5 to 8-1/2 minutes.The exact cooking time will vary depending on the size of your coddler and the size of your eggs.

For one medium egg in a small coddler, cook it for 5 minutes.
For one large egg in a small coddler, cook it for 5 and 1/2 minutes.
For two medium eggs in a large coddler, cook the eggs for 6 and 1/2 minutes.
For two large eggs in a large coddler, cook the eggs for 8 and 1/2 minutes.



, Carefully remove the egg coddler from the hot water and place it on a heat-resistant surface, like a kitchen towel. Grab the side of the metal lid with an oven mitt or separate towel and twist it off.


Insert the end of a spoon or fork into the ring on top of the metal lid and lift the coddler out that way. Alternatively, lift it out by grabbing it with oven mitts.

, The egg should be enjoyed immediately and served while still inside the coddler.

Use the coddled egg as desired.",How to Coddle an Egg2," Remove the eggs from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before the process begins. Allow them to sit out on your kitchen counter or table until they drop to room temperature.


Cold eggs will take longer to cook and may not coddle evenly. As a general rule, though, you should coddle cold eggs for 30 to 60 seconds longer than room temperature eggs.

, Fill a small tea kettle with water and set it on the stove over high heat. Continue heating the water until the kettle whistles and the water is boiling.


You could also prepare the water in a small saucepan if you do not have a kettle.

, As the water in your kettle reaches a boil, prepare an ice bath by filling a medium bowl halfway with cold water and a handful or two of ice.

, Place each egg in a separate heat-resistant container, and place each container on a heat-resistant surface, like a kitchen towel.


You can place multiple eggs in the same bowl, but you do not want the eggs to touch each other at all. If the eggs are packed together inside a dish, the coddling process may not be able to cook the entire egg evenly.

, Once the water has reached a boil, pour it directly over the eggs. Allow the eggs to sit in the hot water for a full 1 minute.This amount of time will produce a coddled egg that is still quite runny. If you want the egg white to firm up a bit, you should leave the eggs in the hot water for about 5 minutes each.
Alternatively, if you prepared the hot water in a saucepan, you could remove the saucepan from the heat and dip the egg directly inside the simmering water. Keep it there for 1 minute.Coddling the egg this way may make the eggshell more likely to break, however.

, Carefully remove the eggs from the hot water with a slotted spoon or tongs, then gently dunk them into the ice bath. Let them stay in the ice bath for 2 minutes to stop the cooking process.


Work carefully to prevent the eggshell from cracking. The eggs are still very runny at this point, so cracking the shell will cause the egg to spill out in a watery mess.

, To get to the eggs, simply crack the shells and dump the contents into a small dish.


Coddled eggs prepared in this manner are most often used in recipes that call for coddled eggs as an ingredient, like Caesar salad dressing and mayonnaise. They are rarely consumed as they are, but you could technically do so. Either way, you should use the coddled egg immediately.

Use as needed.",How to Coddle an Egg3," Fill a shallow bowl or dish with no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of cold water. Add a little ice to drop the temperature even further.


You'll be dropping an open container into this ice bath, so the water needs to be shallow. Otherwise, the water could seep into the cooked egg when you place the container inside the ice bath later on.

, Crack the egg or eggs directly into a small, microwave-safe glass bowl.


You do not nee to cover the dish during this step.
Use a bowl with sides that are at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) tall to prevent ice water from getting inside later on.

When done, the eggs should be slightly cooked yet still have a very runny consistency.

, Carefully place the bowl containing the eggs inside your ice bath. Let it sit there for 30 to 60 seconds to stop the cooking process.


Consider placing a lid or a sheet of plastic wrap over the bowl to help prevent ice water from accidentally seeping inside.

, Coddled eggs prepared in this manner are usually used for dressings and other recipes calling for coddled eggs rather than being eaten plain.

Prepare what you need.,
Prepare the secondary ingredients first.,
Prepare the grill.,
Skewer the centipede on the grill.,
Brush on the sauces before taking it off the grill.",How to Cook Centipedes2," If you decide to grill the centipede, you'll need to start with a few things. You need a skewer about the length of the centipede, or more. Also, other assorted meats go well with the unique texture of the centipede. Conventional Western meats work, like chicken or turkey. It's not recommended to pair red meats with centipedes as the taste of the red meat will overpower the centipede taste.

, Prepare a sauce for the end of the grilling process to add flavor. Consider popular grilling sauces such as barbecue sauce, Sriracha, or fish sauce. You can make barbecue sauce too!
, A low temperature, around 90°C is optimal for grilling. It's important to have a steady heat so that the centipede is cooked thoroughly., Depending on your preferences, you can choose to sear one side or you can cook it evenly. If cooking evenly, make sure one side is not facing the heat for more than 30 seconds. It's best to rotate it twice a minute. If you choose to sear it, 1 minute on one side should be enough., Wait until the last few seconds of grilling to brush on sweet sauces. Otherwise it's possible that the sugar in the sauce will burn up before the centipede is done."

Do not be deceived by location.,
Take note of the harvest date.,
Make sure there's a seal of approval.,
Avoid oils with high levels of free fatty acids.,
Look for an oil with a high polyphenol content.",How to Choose Olive Oil1," Not all olive oil is created equal. Usually, the bottom of a bottle of olive oil says where the oil is from. Labeling can sometimes be intentionally deceitful. The company may boast their olive oil is from Italy, but the oil may only have been packaged in Italy. While an oil boasting of being straight from Italy is not necessarily bad, make sure to check other aspects of the oil carefully. The company may be trying to make easy sales by impressing costumers based on the oil's origin., Olive oil does not have a lengthy shelf life, so look for the harvest date on the label. Ideally, you want to purchase an olive oil that has a more recent harvest date. Olive oil only lasts for two years, and that's assuming it's stored in perfect conditions. Even when stored properly, the flavor diminishes with time. The older the harvest date, the less taste the olive oil will have.If a bottle does not have a harvest date listed, put it back. Never purchase olive oil without knowing the harvest date.

, A seal of approval from at least some kind of olive oil organization should appear somewhere on the label. California-based olive oils, for example, should have a seal of approval from the California Olive Oil Council. This increases the chances the oil is quality. Olive oil that comes with a seal of approval also tends to be more upfront and honest about factors like harvest date.The seal of approval is usually found on the back of a bottle of olive oil.

, Free fatty acids (FFA) are often an indication of the quality of the fruit used in your olive oil. Low levels of FFAs do not necessarily mean olive oil is high quality, but high levels indicate a poor quality oil. Look for oils with free fatty acids less than 10 meq/kg.Free fatty acid levels should be listed on an oil's ingredients label. Avoid purchasing oils that do not list fatty acid levels.

, Polyphenol contributes to the amount of heart-healthy antioxidants in olive oil. In general, a higher polyphenol content indicates a healthier olive oil. A polyphenol content below 300 is considered low and one above 500 is considered high.One downside to a higher polyphenol content, however, is the taste. Some polyphenol contents are over 800, which can make olive oil a little more bitter.

Buy in season.,
Use your senses to pick good fruit at the grocery store.,
Check the stem of the fruit, if it has one.,
Search for the fruit you want until you have found it.,
Look for mold on the fruit.,
Check if the color is what it's supposed to be.,
Look for bruises and spots that indicate the fruit has been roughly handled and damaged.

,
Smell the fruit.,
Feel the fruit, but do so carefully.,
Select fruit that is in a bin or open storage box, not in bulk bags or boxes.,
Pick the fruit up.",How to Choose Fruit1," Fruit that comes out of season comes from farther away, and generally lacks the flavor of fruit in season.

, The smell, touch and look of the fruit are all important in determining whether you get ripe, delicious fruit or sour, unripe or bland fruit.

, The stem is the natural clock of when the fruit was picked. Green stem with ripe fruit= A winner; Green stem with very hard fruit = Picked early and will possibly become mealy when ripened; Shriveled dry stem = Picked long ago lacking flavor and texture of fresh fruit.

, The less popular fruits may not be in season which can mean that they will not be in the store at that time.

, If you find any do not take it.

, For example, don't take a green strawberry.

,, Some fruits have a ""ripe"" odor, like cantaloupe and honeydew melons. Some fruit may have a sour odor if they are beginning to spoil.

, Firm fruits like apples and pears should feel firm, but peaches, plums, and other ""soft"" fleshed fruits should feel slightly soft. If you test it this way, do so carefully as not to damage the fruit.

, The old saying, ""One rotten apple will spoil the whole lot,"" is often true, and you will seldom find a large bag of fruit without at least some damaged fruit in it.

, If it's heavy for its size, then you have successfully found yourself a good piece of fruit!
