Search online for a butter churn retailer.,
Devise your own churner.,
Ensure that the cream to be used for making the butter is at room temperature (60ºF/15ºC).,
Fill the container to a quarter or a third (no higher) with cream.,
Turn the wheel or handle of the churner, or move the dash up and down, or turn on the electric beater.,
Wash and work the butter.,
Transfer the butter to its mold.",How to Churn Butter," They can be purchased from kitchenware and homestead specialist stores, online auction sellers and may be available through such sites as Craigslist or #Freecycle.

Butter churns can be wooden, ceramic or glass. Some are small or handheld, while others are much larger and can be used when standing. Unless you're making huge quantities and/or want a workout, the handheld or small one will probably be sufficient for the standard kitchen cook.
There are antique versions and modern versions of butter churners. If purchasing an antique one, check it thoroughly to ensure that all parts are working and that they're not rusted, etc. You may need to replace parts before using; if unsure, ask a specialist in antique kitchen products or a dairy farmer for advice.;
, It is possible to make a butter churner, if you're good with wood, cutting and improvising.

The simplest version is to make an ""up and down churn"", which consists of a dash (small dowel or similar) inserted into a jar through the lid and then moved up and down.
A more complex paddle churn can made using a jar or coffee can with a lid, through which you push various pieces of dowel and rig them up to a small wheel for turning. Look online for a suitable pattern.
Use your electric beater (such as the ubiquitous KitchenAid mixer). Depending on the motor quality, this might require turning on and off, to give the motor a break but some of the newer, heavier-duty ones should be able to cope. It's a good idea to cover the mixer with a tea towel, to prevent the cream from spattering upward when ""churning"".

, If the room is cold, use warm water to help warm up the cream while it is still inside a container. If the cream is too warm, cool it down with cool water., Any additional amount will make it hard to churn., Continue to turn the mechanism (churn) for up to half an hour. If the butter is not forming by now, the cream is either too hot or too cold and will need to be either warmed up or cooled down.

The butter should form much faster if working with an electric mixer.

, This step is optional but it does help the butter store better. Once the butter has formed, remove it from the churner.

Place the butter in a ceramic or glass jar.
Add 1/2 cup cold water. Shake for two to three minutes.
Strain out the water.
Repeat one more time to reveal clear water.
Mash the butter. This will remove the last of the water, then strain.

, Squeeze it in, then refrigerate to set. It is now ready to eat, or can be stored for longer. See How to store butter for details."

Pick extra virgin olive oil if you're using it as a condiment.,
Opt for cheaper olive oil if you're using it for cooking.,
Decide between filtered and unfiltered.,
Choose the taste you want.",How to Choose Olive Oil2," If you're looking for an oil to drizzle over breads, cheeses, or meats, go for extra virgin varieties. Extra virgin olive oil is best served unheated and will therefore be very flavorful when used as a condiment.When using olive oil as a salad dressing or for mild foods like mozzarella, go for a mild or medium strength oil.
Heartier foods or more flavorful vegetables like tomatoes pair well with a more robust oil.

, If you're using olive oil for a cooking oil, the oil loses a lot of its flavor during the cooking process. Therefore, there is little point splurging on an expensive, flavorful cooking oil. Go for a slightly lower priced oil. It will probably not taste as good as pricier brands, but taste is less important with cooking oils.Extra virgin olive oil tolerates heat best, so opt for cheat brands of extra virgin olive oil for cooking.

, Many people assume filtered oil is higher quality, but this is not necessarily always the case. It depends more on how quickly you intend to use the oil. Unfiltered oils sometimes have a stronger taste, but you need to use them quickly as they spoil much faster than filtered varieties. In general, go for filtered oil if you need olive oil with a long shelf life and opt for unfiltered varieties if you plan to use the oil right away., Different brands and types of oils have different tastes. Make sure to account for taste when selecting your oil and pick an oil that corresponds to your desired taste.Extra virgin brands of Colavita tend to have a very complex taste. For a more neutral taste, go for Bertolli extra virgin.
Think about other factors, such as the oils spiciness, grassiness, fruitiness, and so on. It may be difficult to assess this at a grocery store. If you need a very specific flavor, shop at a farmer's market. Those selling olive oil will generally be able to give you a good overview of their product's flavor.

Shop at a mill, if possible.,
Shop at places that allow a taste test.,
Check the return policy.,
Check the bottles.",How to Choose Olive Oil3," If you live near a mill that produces olive oil, see if they have a shop on sight. The fresher the oil, the better. Also, mill workers may be able to give you a better overview of the varying flavors of their oils. If you can buy directly from a mill, do so., Most people do not have the privilege of living near a mill, however. As a second resort, it's always a good idea to shop at places that allow taste testing. Gourmet food stores, farmer's markets, and stores that specialize in olive oil often allow a taste test. Tasting the oil ahead of time is a great way to ensure it has the flavor you desire., Ideally, you should be able to return olive oil if you don't like it. As olive oil is expensive, you don't want to be stuck with a bottle of oil that does not suit your needs. Make sure you're able to return olive oil you purchase and get at least some of your money back., Olive oil should be stored in dark bottles. This will increase the shelf life. A store that sells olive oil in dark bottles will likely provide higher quality, fresher oil. Avoid stores where olive oil is stored improperly."

Smell them.,
Pick ones of the right color.,
Taste them.,
Choose the right size.,
Buy them during the right season.",How to Choose Fruit2," Do they smell like strawberries? Unripe or not flavoured strawberries will not have a very strong scent. Ripe, sweet strawberries smell strongly of strawberry.;
, Strawberries should be a deep red all over. If they are a light red or have some green or yellow on them, they are not ripe and they won't taste good.

, If the grocer allows it, always taste a sample strawberry. This is the single best way to know if you are getting decent strawberries.

, Although those giant strawberries look most luscious, it's the smaller berries which can pack the most flavor punch.

, The best season for strawberries is spring and summer. Strawberries at any other time of the year will lack flavor. Strawberries do not ripen after they are picked.

Look at the colors of the grapes and stems.,
Buy in the right season.",How to Choose Fruit3," The stems of the grapes should be beige to brown, and drying up. Green, full stems mean the grapes are not ripe and they will tend to be sour or tasteless. Also, look for a slight pale-yellow hue on green grapes, while red grapes should be deeply colored with no sign of green.

, Grapes are grown year round in different parts of the world. But, you should avoid the imported grapes from Chile during January-April. Eat U.S. grown grapes during the season of July-December.

, Peaches should give slightly when you squeeze them. They should not be hard as a rock.

, Peaches should be yellow with good amounts of red.

, Peaches are in season mid-May to mid-August. You can ripen peaches in a paper bag. According to the fruit devotees at Produce For Better Health Foundation, peaches emit ethylene gas during ripening. This natural ripening hormone speeds up the process of turning those hard-as-rock peaches into sweet-as-candy delights. By putting the peaches into a loosely closed paper bag, the ethylene gas surrounds the fruits, helping with the ripening process.

Hit the watermelon lightly.,
There are many varieties of watermelon and colors vary.",How to Choose Fruit5," If it sound like a drum that watermelon has hollow heart. Hollow heart is when there are parts in the middle of the melon that are empty. Also inspect the watermelon for bruises or parts that have been smashed. Smashed parts usually make a weird texture to the watermelon that feels flaky.

, Usually if you want a ripe watermelon choose a darker green one. Lighter green ones may not be as ripe. Remember all watermelons have one yellow area at the bottom if they have more that means the watermelon did not get enough sun light.

Grab any special extras you want.,
Combine your vinegar, syrup, and ginger.,
Add your water.,
Shake your container.,
Let the switchel steep.,
Serve and enjoy.",How to Make Switchel," Because switchel is such a simple drink, each ingredient is important. That being said, those ingredients should be the best ones you can find. Look for raw apple cider vinegar, and make sure to choose pure maple syrup, rather than one that lists dozens of ingredients on the label. Avoid syrup that says “fat free” or “sugar free,” as those certainly aren’t pure. Purchase the freshest ginger available.High-quality ingredients may be a bit more expensive, but they will last you awhile. You only use a small amount for this recipe.;
, Because you’ll need to thoroughly mix your ingredients, it’s good to use a container with a lid so that you can shake it. If you don’t have anything big enough, you can certainly just stir everything with a spoon. The switchel will have to steep in your fridge, so make sure to choose a container that fits!

, This is simply a matter of personal preference. If you are planning on using your switchel as a sports recovery drink, you may want to stick with regular, still water. If you like a little bit of fizz, use a seltzer or sparkling water.Note that depending on which type of water you use, your instructions will change slightly to ensure fizzy water doesn’t go flat.

, Some people enjoy adding a splash of lime or lemon juice to their switchel. If you’re of legal drinking age, you can certainly use your switchel as cocktail mixer. If you’re going to be serving this drink to friends, you can make it look fancy with a sprig of mint. There are lots of possibilities to get creative with this drink., Use measuring spoons or cups to make sure you are adding exact amounts. When it comes to the syrup, start out with less than you think you need. Because the syrup is so sugary, you can ruin the switchel by adding too much. You can add more later, as needed.If you've never grated ginger before, you can learn how here.

, If you are using regular water, pour in into your container over the ingredients.If you are using seltzer or sparkling water, you can skip this step. Instead, you will mix the other ingredients together, and only add your fizzy water right before serving. This will keep your carbonated water from going flat.

, If you can’t seal your container, just stir it thoroughly with a large spoon.Keep stirring until the maple syrup has dissolved. The grated ginger will naturally settle to the bottom over time, so you’ll need to re-shake or re-stir every time you drink your switchel.

, Pop your container into the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours.If you are using carbonated water, you can either let the ingredients – sans water – steep, or you can add the carbonated water now and serve it without steeping. If you are using regular water, steeping it with strengthen the flavor, but you can serve it immediately instead if you choose.

, Pour your switchel through a strainer in order to catch any pieces of ginger. Serve your switchel with ice to make it extra cold and refreshing. If you’re feeling fancy, add a sprig of mint as a garnish. This tangy, unique drink is sure to be a crowd-pleaser, whether you’re sharing with your family or serving it at a party.

Judge its flavor qualities.,
Judge its intensity.,
Judge its sweetness.,
Feel the carbonation level.,
Smell its aroma.",How to Tell the Difference Between Coke and Pepsi1," Coke and Pepsi taste quite similar, but their flavors aren't exactly the same. Start by taking a sip of your drink. Concentrate on the flavor — ask yourself, ""What else does this taste like?"" Everyone's sense of taste is different, but a few popular comparisons are as follows:Coke is often said to resemble raisins with a hint of vanilla.

Pepsi is often said to resemble citrus fruit.;
, A soda's flavor isn't just about what other things it tastes like — it's also about how those tastes feel in your mouth. Take another drink of your soda. Concentrate on how the soda feels as it moves over your tongue and down your throat. Again, everyone's opinion is different, but some common observations are below:Coke has a flavor that many define as ""smoother."" The flavor rises gradually and recedes gently. It should go down your throat easily.

Pepsi has a flavor that many define as ""sharper."" The flavor has a stronger ""attack"" — it rises in a sudden ""burst"" of flavor. It should be a little more intense as it goes down your throat.

, Take another drink. This time, concentrate on the sugar content in the drink. Is the sweetness overpowering, or is it more subtle? This can be difficult to judge unless you have both drinks in front of you so that you can compare them. According to official nutritional information:Coke has a little less sugar, so it is slightly less sweet.

Pepsi has a little more sugar, so it is slightly more sweet.

, Hold a sip of the soda in your mouth for a few seconds. Concentrate on the feeling of the carbonation bubbles. Is the drink quite fizzy, or slightly ""flatter"" than you're used to in a soda? This, too, is difficult to tell unless you have both drinks for comparison purposes. See below:Coke has more carbonation, so it is slightly fizzier.

Pepsi has less carbonation, so it is slightly ""flatter.""

, If you still aren't sure, try smelling your drink as you gently swirl it in its glass (like a wine snob). This releases a little more of the aromatic chemicals into the air so your nose can pick them up. Concentrate on the aroma — if you had to choose, does it remind you of raisins and vanilla (like the flavor of Coke) or citrus fruits (like the flavor of Pepsi)?

Have both sodas for comparison purposes.,
See which you prefer after a sip test.,
See which you prefer after drinking as much as you want.",How to Tell the Difference Between Coke and Pepsi2," As noted above, all of the tiny differences between Coke and Pepsi are easier (though not exactly easy) to notice when you can compare both drinks (rather than tasting one and trying to guess what it is). To stand a better chance of telling Coke and Pepsi apart, have both drinks available and ready to drink so you can try one and then immediately try the other.


If you're doing this for entertainment purposes, have a friend blindfold you and scramble the drink containers so you're not sure which is which. If you're training to be able to tell the drinks apart in the future, feel free to leave the blindfold off.

, Your first action should be to take only a small sip of each soda. While everyone's sense of taste will differ, this test isn't quite as random as you may think. See below:


Statistically, more people tend to prefer the taste of Pepsi after just one sip. Its sharper, sweeter taste makes it create a stronger impression. It can even caused increased stimulation in the part of the brain responsible for judging flavors., Now, continue to drink both sodas until you run out or you start to feel full. Take note of which soda you were more comfortable drinking a large amount of. If your preference switched (that is, you preferred one soda for the sip test but the other once you drank more of each), you're like most people. See below:


Statistically, more people tend to prefer Coke when drinking an entire can or more. Its smoother, less sweet flavor makes it easier to drink large quantities of it.Thus, if you liked one soda better after just a sip but liked the other one better once you drank more, the first one was probably Pepsi and the second was probably Coke.

Stick to no more than one to two energy drinks per day.,

Keep tabs on your daily caffeine intake.,
Watch for sugar content and other ingredients.,
Talk to your doctor if you have underlying health conditions.,
Don't use energy drinks to replace adequate sleep or proper nutrition.,
Limit your energy drink intake if you are pregnant or nursing.,
Limit or eliminate consumption by kids and teens.,
Think twice about using caffeine powder.,
Use energy drinks wisely, but don’t overreact to unsubstantiated fears.",How to Drink Energy Drinks Safely," The term “energy drink” refers broadly to beverages that contain a mix of ingredients (almost always including caffeine) that are intended to provide a burst of energy, alertness, and focus. Beyond that, there exists a wide range of products that fit into the category, from soda-like canned drinks to small liquid “shots” to powdered mixes. Setting a blanket limit on how many energy drinks you should have per day is therefore quite difficult.For the most popular, mass-marketed energy drinks out there, a limit of two servings per day seems reasonably safe for most healthy adults. For non-concentrated liquid energy drinks (like Red Bull, Monster, Rockstar, etc.), this equates to about 16 ounces (500 ml) per day. Consider this to be an upper limit, though, and use energy drinks as little as possible as your safest choice.;
, In cases where episodes of cardiac arrest or other dangerous health events have occurred, energy drink consumption has often been paired with athletic practice or games or similar vigorous exercise. Some athletes like the “boost” of energy and focus the drinks seem to provide, but the caffeine and other ingredients compound many of the physical changes (increased heart rate, for instance) that already take place when you exert yourself.Especially for people with existing cardiac conditions, either diagnosed or undiagnosed (as is often the case with children or young adults), the pairing of energy drinks and vigorous physical activity may possibly cause irregular cardiac activity, such as atrial fibrillation or even sudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS).Such negative events are quite rare, but the risk is probably still much greater than the reward, especially since simply exercising will supply you with an ample dose of energy and focus.

, It should perhaps come as no surprise that the increasing popularity of energy drinks has led to the development of mixed alcoholic drinks that use Red Bull, etc. Some people contend that the energy drinks help counteract the intoxicating effects of the alcohol, allowing them to drink (and party) longer. Unfortunately, this mix may also make you less aware of just how many energy drinks (or how much alcohol) you’ve consumed, and mask potentially dangerous health impacts.Perhaps most dangerously, some people down energy drinks after alcohol consumption so that they can drive home “safely;” however, driving drunk while being slightly more alert is every bit as dangerous as simply driving drunk, maybe even more so if it gives you unfounded confidence to drive when you shouldn’t., In the U.S., some energy drinks are marketed as “dietary supplements,” which places them beyond the regulatory purview of the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This means, among other things, that the manufacturers do not have to disclose an ingredient list or nutrition facts on the beverage packaging. If you drink one of these beverages, then, you really have no idea what exactly you are putting into your body.Fortunately for consumers, about 95% of energy drinks (including the most popular brands) are now marketed as beverages and not dietary supplements, which places them under the purview of the FDA and requires ingredient and nutritional labeling. Of course, it is up to you to actually read the labeling, decipher what exactly is in your drink (and how much), and keep track of how much caffeine and other ingredients you are consuming per day., According to the website of the world's best known energy drink, practically any time is a good time to use their beverage. You could / should use it while driving, studying, working, playing sports, playing video games, and partying day or night.Buried a bit deeper within the website, however, you will find some more practical recommendations, such as keeping your daily caffeine intake to no more than 400 mg (or five cans of this particular drink) per day as a healthy adult. It also advises against consumption by the caffeine-sensitive, and limited intake by pregnant or nursing women and children. It additionally provides a complete ingredient list.Find out as much information about the drink you wish to consume, and consult the manufacturer's recommendations, but use third-party, scientifically-grounded advice to determine if you should consume the drink (and if so, how much).

, Despite popular perception, caffeine is not technically an addictive substance, although you may experience some minor withdrawal symptoms for a day or two if you go “cold turkey” on a heavy caffeine habit. In moderation, caffeine is safe for most people, but in high doses it can cause cardiac irregularities and other medical issues (and, in extreme cases, death).Recommendations vary because the effects of higher caffeine intake are not entirely clear, but 300-400 mg of caffeine per day is a good daily maximum to keep in mind. For reference, a typical cup of coffee (8 oz.) has about 100 mg of caffeine; a soda (12 oz), about 40 mg; and energy drinks (250 ml), typically somewhere between 50 mg and 160 mg.Under normal circumstances, pregnant or nursing women should limit themselves to 200 mg or fewer of caffeine per day; children, 50-100 mg per day maximum., Choosing energy drinks with adequate labeling lets you keep track of more than your caffeine intake. Many of these drinks, for instance, have high doses of sugar per serving. The health dangers of excessive daily sugar consumption have been well demonstrated, and avoiding added sugars is a specific recommendation in the newest U.S. dietary guidelines.Energy drinks also commonly contain ingredients like taurine, an amino acid found naturally in animal products; guarana, a South American plant that naturally contains caffeine (and is in addition to the caffeine specifically added to the drink); and assorted B vitamins. Again, in moderation, these ingredients are generally safe to consume; excessive consumption may be another story., One or two energy drinks per day is probably safe for the average healthy adult, but those with certain medical conditions should take additional precautions before using them. In particular, if you have heart disease, another cardiac condition, or high blood pressure, you should consult your doctor first.If you experience irritability, nervousness, insomnia, a rapid heartbeat, or elevated blood pressure after a single energy drink, you may have a heightened caffeine sensitivity or another condition worthy of your concern. Talk to your doctor before trying energy drinks again.
If you are using energy drinks regularly because of persistent problems with low energy, you may have a sleep disorder or one of many potentially harmful medical conditions. Contact your physician for a check-up.

, Always remember that you will get more consistent, lasting, healthier energy by getting enough sleep and eating properly than by chugging down energy drinks. Energy drinks give you a short burst of energy that will not last, while proper rest and nutrition will keep you going through the day without ""crashing out.""This wikiHow article offers some useful information on the importance of sufficient sleep (seven to nine hours per night for the typical adult) and how to make sure you get it.
According to the the most recent dietary guidelines, you should avoid added sugars and derive steady energy from a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats.

, Anyone who is or has recently been pregnant knows that there are a host of nutritional precautions that need to be taken in order to protect your health and that of the fetus. Excessive caffeine intake, for example, can cause cardiac irregularities in the fetus directly, or in the mother (at the risk of both her and the fetus).Some experts and mothers-to-be still believe in swearing off caffeine completely during pregnancy, but studies indicate that a reduced daily caffeine intake is generally of no concern for both mother and child. Stick to less than 200 mg of caffeine per day, or the amount recommended by your OBGYN.

, Teenagers make up a sizable percentage of the energy drink market, likely due to the “coolness” factor as much as the energy boost. Caffeine and the other ingredients common to energy drinks are not inherently dangerous to children, but should be ingested in lesser amounts than the maximums recommended for grown adults.Because energy drinks have no nutritional or therapeutic benefit, can contain unknown ingredients, and have not been subjected to long-term studies regarding their effect on children, the safest measure is to have children entirely avoid consuming them. Most children and teens should not lack for energy anyway, unless they are not getting enough sleep or are suffering from a medical condition that requires attention., Some people choose to skip the pre-mixed energy drinks and try to make their own. Powdered caffeine can be purchased as a dietary supplement and is in theory just as safe in that form as it is when pre-mixed in beverages. However, there is no guarantee that only caffeine is in the powder, and a slight measuring error can move your caffeine intake into dangerous territory.The FDA has in fact issued warnings about using caffeine powder, because of the ease by which an inaccurate home measurement can lead to a dangerous overdose. Unless you are confident about the quality of the product and very precise in your dosing, it is probably best to avoid using caffeine powder.
For their own safety, it is advisable to prevent teens from using caffeine powder.

, As with most foods, drugs, and supplements, moderation is the operative word when dealing with energy drinks. If you can do without them, that is probably your safest, healthiest choice; however, if you do choose to consume them in moderation and don’t have existing risk factors, you don’t need to feel as though you are risking your health by drinking one.Ideally, you should rely on a healthy diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep to provide you with the energy you need to get through the day. Black coffee is probably your next best option, because it is low in calories and ingredients.
More oversight to ensure that energy drinks contain what they claim to contain may be warranted, but calls for them to be banned or heavily regulated because they are a serious health hazard are excessive based on current evidence. If you make smart, informed choices, you can drink energy drinks safely.

, Not being able to find anything among out-of-control piles of papers is stressful. Clothes that you never wear, papers that are falling everywhere and useless items that you feel bad about throwing out can invade your space and take over your life. Dump all unnecessary stuff in a big garbage can, and you'll be able to breathe easier and have more energy.

, Being dehydrated makes you feel tired and irritable. If you are not thirsty, that does not mean that you drink enough water. By the time you feel thirsty it's too late - you are already dehydrated.


Most people need at least 8 cups of water per day. The easiest way to know that you are drinking enough is to buy one of those ""8 glass"" water-bottles that they sell in most drugstores.

, Sitting in the chair all day can make you feel stiff and tired, and then you'd feel too lazy to get up, creating a vicious cycle of inactivity. Make it into a habit to take a walk every day, and your energy levels will increase.

, Having the same old routine every day sucks out your soul and steals your energy. Do not allow yourself to get stuck in a rut! Do something new on a regular basis.

, When you have a goal, you will tend to work harder to achieve it. And once you finish it, you will feel great. Think about it.

, Isolation is a recipe for bad mood and low energy. Even when you don't feel like dealing with anyone, spending time with a person whose company you enjoy will energize you.

, Carrying excess weight puts additional strain on the body and makes it to work harder. Shed the excess fat, and you'll feel lighter and more energetic.

, Emotions that are unexpressed remain stored in your body. This causes fatigue because the physical body then spends a great deal of energy holding onto those emotions.

, Did you know that people who feel sad are less energetic than people who are cheerful? Try doing something active that also makes you feel happy, like dancing to your favorite music or going out with your friends. You'll be so cheerful, you'll wanna get up and get going!

, If you feel like you know everything and you've done it all and you're satisfied with ""status quo"", you'll have less energy. It's just a fact. People who are dreamers, who tend to improve all the time, have more energy. You will always be trying to get better!

, Instead, eat several small meals (4/5/6) per day to get the metabolism going and you will feel better. Try it! It may or may not work for you. In general, regardless of how many meals you eat, try to eat only until you are full. Otherwise you will feel bloated and tired.

Examine the grape texture.,
Look at the skin on the grapes.,
Check the stem.,
Determine if grapes are in season.,
Choose a slightly sweeter grape for eating.,
Select a very sweet or tart grape for making jam.,
Pick a wine grape that suits your tastes.,
Store grapes without washing them.,
Keep grapes in their original packaging.,
Chill grapes in the refrigerator or freezer.",How to Choose Grapes," Ripe, healthy grapes should be firm and plump on all sides. If a grape is shriveled where the stem meets the fruit or if there are any signs of moldiness, the grapes are not in good condition. You should also avoid grapes that have excess moisture inside the bag, as this is often a sign that the grapes may be susceptible to mold or rot., The best grapes will have a healthy shade to the skin. Ripe red grapes should have a dark purple hue, as any signs of green indicate that red grapes are not yet ripe. Ripe black grapes should have a full, rich shade of bluish-black, and green grapes should have a yellowish hue.In addition to skin tone, healthy grapes should also have a light silver-colored dusting on the skin called bloom.
Bloom is commonly mistaken for dirt, but it's actually the plant's way of protecting the fruit from drying out or rotting., The stem of a healthy grape cluster should be green and flexible. If the stem is brown or brittle, the grapes may be old or poorly-grown.You should also make sure that the majority of grapes are securely attached to the stem, as this is considered a sign of healthy, well-grown grapes., The climate in which a grape variety is grown will affect when it ripens and how it tastes. The majority of each type of grape (green, red, and black) generally tend to ripen in the same part of the growing season. There are exceptions, of course, and each type's growing season may vary somewhat, depending on where they are grown.Green grapes typically ripen in the middle of the growing season. Ripe green grapes should have a yellowish hue to the skin.Red grapes tend to ripen fairly early in the growing season, though there are some exceptions. Ripe red grapes should have a dark reddish-purplish hue without any signs of green.
Black grapes generally ripen in the early to middle part of the growing season. Ripe black grapes should have a rich violet hue to the skin.

, Grapes can vary significantly in sweetness from one type to another. In general, though, most people choose sweeter grapes if they're being used as table grapes (for eating as they are).Canadice, Concord, Himrod, Mars, Neptune, Niagara, Reliance, and Thompson Seedless are among the most commonly-purchased table grapes found in stores.

, When choosing grapes to make jam with, you may want to opt for a grape that's sweeter than what you would pick for table eating. For this reason, many jam makers prefer muscadine grapes for a sweeter jam, though others do prefer a more tart grape for a more balanced jam profile.Beta grapes and Chambourcin grapes make a good tart jam, while something more saccharin like Van Buren grapes would be ideal for a sweeter jam.
Most wine grapes can also be used for making juice and jam, and they tend to range from very dry to very sweet. Which type you choose will depend largely on your taste preferences.

, Wine grapes (which are also frequently used for making juice and jam) range dramatically in flavor, from very dry to very sweet. Which grape you choose to make wine or juice with will depend entirely on what flavor profile you're looking for.Cayuga, Chardonel, Moore's Diamond, and Riesling grapes are all good choices for a dry wine or juice.
Canadice, Catawba, Jupiter, LaCrosse, and Muscat grapes will produce a sweeter wine or juice.
Some people like both sweet and dry wines, depending on the meal that wine is being served with. Try experimenting with different types of grapes and different flavor profiles to find a grape that works best for your needs.

, It's important to wash grapes before eating them to ensure that you remove any bacteria and pesticides. However, storing wet grapes is more likely to lead to mold and rot.Instead of washing the whole bag, it's best to just remove however many grapes you need for one serving and wash only those grapes.


When you do wash grapes, you can simply rinse them under clean, cool water from the faucet.
Place washed grapes on a plate with paper towels to prevent water from spilling as you snack on them.

, The bags that grapes are sold in are specially designed to protect the fruit while simultaneously allowing the grapes to breathe. These ventilation holes also allow any moisture to escape so that the grapes do not get moldy or go bad as quickly as they would in an unventilated bag.While sealable sandwich bags are great for storing some foods, it's best to store grapes in a bag that lets the fruit breathe unless you plan on freezing them.

, Grapes keep best in a cool to cold environment. If you're storing them for a short period of time, keep grapes in the back of the refrigerator and set the temperature to around 30 to 32 degrees Fahrenheit (-1 to 0 degrees Celsius).If you're planning on using frozen grapes in a smoothie or simply want to store them for prolonged periods of time, you can store them in the freezer. Simply wash, dry, and de-stem the grapes, and they're ready for the freezer."

Understand the benefits of different energy drinks.,
Mix together the water, fruit juice, salt, and sweetener in a blender.,
Add fruit and berries for vitamins and sugar.,
Fruits and vegetables like kale, spinach, and apples (with the peel) are high in fiber and vitamin A.

,
Add in any supplements, like protein powder or caffeine.,
Blend everything together.",How to Make an Energy Drink," At their core, all energy drinks rehydrate your body and provide it with essential minerals, vitamins, and electrolytes to function at it's best. Some energy drinks are meant to wake you up, some replenish your body after exercise, and others help you get the most out of a workout. Knowing the parts of an energy drink will help you make the right one for you.



Electrolytes: Natural chemicals that help your muscles communicate and work correctly, they are found in salts and fresh fruit like bananas and strawberries.Sugars: Humans need sugar to function, as sugars are the basic unit of energy that our muscles and cells need to survive. They are found almost everywhere, from honey and sugar to fruits and vegetables. Because they are simple, our bodies can use them for energy soon after being ingested.

Protein: Most of the human body's functions are done by proteins, from using our muscles to fighting infections. After a hard workout we need to replenish proteins to heal muscles and promote growth. In most energy drink, protein is found in yogurt, milk, or special protein powders.;
, Place all of your liquids in the blender and use a spoon to taste. If it is too diluted then add more juice; if it tastes too tart or sweet then add more water.


Substitute coconut water for fresh water to add potassium and simple sugars to your drink naturally.Omit adding sugar if you are using sweetened juice or lots of fresh fruit.
You can also use less water and instead add ice for a cooler drink.

, Fruits are a natural source of energy, vitamins, and minerals, and your body can process them rapidly for quick energy. While by no means exhaustive, the following fruits can help give your drink specific properties:


Watermelons, blueberries, and cherries have antioxidants that can relieve muscle soreness.Bananas, kiwis, and peaches are high in potassium, an essential electrolyte.Citrus fruits provide lots of vitamin C needed for cardiovascular and immune health, and will help wake you up.,, After you've created the base of your energy drink you can add supplements to get the most out of your drink. To make a thicker, more filling drink you can add yogurt and ice, for example.


Protein powder and wheat germ are great for helping build muscle after a tough work-out.
Chia seeds contain anti-oxidants, calcium, and omega-3's that may help boost energy levels and brain health.Powdered caffeine, and Taurine though dangerous at high levels, are a legal way to give your drink an energy boost similar to Red Bull or Rockstar Energy Drinks. Be sure to check the recommended amount before adding.

, If you are making a simple drink of water, juice, salt, and sugar, you can always mix by hand. However, if you add fresh fruit, yogurt, ice, or leafy greens like kale, you will need a blender to mix everything.

Identify foods that are certified biodynamic.,
Purchase biodynamic food from local producers.,
Order food from biodynamic food providers.",How to Choose Biodynamic Foods1," For a food to be certified biodynamic, it must meet certain criteria set by a regulatory non-profit agency, Demeter USA.Once those criteria is met, Demeter USA allows this food to be labeled with a biodynamic certification mark.


This certification mark has the words ""Demeter"" across its top, the words ""Certified Biodynamic"" across the bottom, and the image of a plant sprouting in between.;
, There may be a certified biodynamic producer near you. Although, since the number of biodynamic farmers is still relatively small, you might have to travel some distance to the nearest farm. In many cases, these farmers may be willing to sell you some of their biodynamic food directly.


Find local biodynamic producers by doing a general keyword search for ""local biodynamic farms"" or ""biodynamic farms near me."" You might also inquire with the produce manager at your local grocery store, as they might be able to provide you with contact information for biodynamic producers.
Farmer's lead very busy lives. If you want to meet with a biodynamic farmer to discuss buying items from them directly, you may want to call and schedule an appointment first.
When talking to a biodynamic farmer, you may want to inquire whether or not they sell their items at local farmer's markets. These may be just the place for you to purchase biodynamic food.

, Larger biodynamic producers may have phone or online ordering services, which you should also be able to find online. Try searching for ""certified biodynamic farms in .Use these services to order food directly from biodynamic providers. Prioritize the nearest producers to cut down on shipping costs.


One downside to this kind of ordering is that it often requires a bulk shipment, which might be more food than one person or family can handle.

Choose ripe Hass avocados if you’re making guacamole.,
Determine when you are serving the avocados.,
Choose an oily variety if you’re making moisturizer or a beauty mask.",How to Choose Avocados1," Hass avocados are available year-round, and make up the vast majority of the avocado market. Their buttery texture is perfect for making great guacamole. Their tough skin allows you to easily dice the flesh while it’s still within the skin, then scoop it out to mix with other ingredients.Because it’s tough and flexible, you can also use Hass avocado skin as a creative way to scoop guacamole when you’re serving it to your guests.
If you’re slicing avocados for a salad or to eat on their own, go with a slightly less ripe fruit than you would for guacamole.
The slices will stay intact better if they’re a little less ripe, allowing for better presentation.;
, If you are preparing a meal containing avocados and need them immediately, choose ripe, ready-to-eat avocados. However, if you are buying the avocados in advance, you can purchase unripe fruit and let them soften at home.


To ripen avocados at home, you can store them at room temperature, and they should ripen over three or four days, depending on how firm they were when you purchased them.
To speed up the ripening process, place the avocados in a brown paper bag with a banana. The banana releases small amounts of ethylene gas, which helps other fruit ripen faster.To stop the ripening process, store the avocados in the refrigerator.

, Avocados are often used as natural moisturizers. The oils in their flesh are what makes them desirable for use on skin. California-grown avocados tend to contain more oil, so take note of its origin when you’re looking for a fruit for beauty purposes.Hass avocados are most readily available, and are certainly oily enough for use in beauty masks.
Other suitable varieties include the Pinkerton, Sharwil, Anaheim, the Daily 11, and MacArthur."

Make a refreshing and energizing iced tea.,
Blend yourself an energy smoothie.,
Create your own electrolyte replenishing drink.,
Make a protein drink from scratch.,
Eat a balanced diet.,
Get lots of sleep.,
Exercise regularly.,
Drink caffeine only in small quantities.",How to Avoid Crashing After Having an Energy Drink," Instead of drinking the entire energy drink at once, spread it out over the course of a couple hours. Not only will this prevent huge spikes in your adrenaline, dopamine, and insulin levels, it will also prevent the dips that cause the crash.Drink one to two ounces (30 to 60 ml) every 15 minutes rather than drinking it all at once.;
, Avoid drinking caffeine on an empty stomach, as this could cause greater hormone spikes and dips.To help your body metabolize the caffeine and sugar more steadily and to keep your energy levels consistent, eat healthy foods throughout the day (spread out over four meals), including:


Carbohydrates, such as pasta, cereal, and potatoesWhole grains
Fruits, nuts, and vegetables, Caffeine can be a great way to give yourself some extra alertness, but there are optimal times of day to consume it to get the most benefits. During the day, your body has natural spikes in cortisol, which is a stress hormone, and you should avoid drinking caffeine during these spikes. The best times to drink caffeine are:Between 9:30 and 11:30 a.m.
Between 1:30 and 5 p.m.

, Although the caffeine in energy drinks can cause its own crash, a sugar crash will prolong and exacerbate the effects.For one, sugar crashes can be worse than caffeine crashes, and the two don’t occur at the same time. While the effects of caffeine will last for at least five hours, a sugar crash will occur within about two hours.To avoid extra calories and the sugar crash, look for sugar-free energy drinks.

, This is particularly important for athletes looking for extra energy during endurance training. Your body loses electrolytes when you sweat, and your muscles burn off glycogen during long workouts, so it’s important to replenish these stores during workouts that exceed an hour., While caffeine alone won’t dehydrate your body, certain energy drinks can, especially if they contain a lot of sugar.To prevent dehydration from energy drinks, be sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day.


Dehydration can cause sleepiness, irritability, headaches, and confusion, which will only make an energy drink crash worse., Homemade energy drinks, electrolyte drinks, smoothies, and protein shakes can be consumed in the morning or during the day for an extra burst of energy. For a refreshing iced tea:Boil one cup (240 ml) of water. Pour it over four grams (or two tea bags) of loose-leaf green tea and two grams (one bag) of yerba maté tea.
Steep for five minutes, then remove the tea bags or strain the leaves. Stir in 1.5 tablespoons (22.5 g or ml) of sweetener, such as honey, sugar, or maple syrup, and two tablespoons (15 ml) fresh lemon juice.
Cool to room temperature. When it’s cool, serve the drink over ice with mint garnish (optional).

, This is an energizing smoothie that’s easy to make, because you simply place all the ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. In the blender, combine:One orange, peeled
¾ cup (180 ml) coconut milk
1 tablespoon (15 ml) honey
1 tablespoon (15 g) ground flaxseed
6 ounces (170 g) regular, light, or non-dairy yogurt
Four to six ice cubes

, For people who are very active throughout the day and sweat a lot, it might be a good idea to replenish your electrolytes with a homemade drink. By making it from home, you can control the ingredients and the amount of salt. In a blender, combine until smooth:3 cups (720 ml) coconut water
1 cup (144 gr) strawberries
1 cup (240 ml) fresh water
Four to six ice cubes
1/8 teaspoon (0.625 g) sea salt
2 tablespoons (30 g or ml) sweetener (such as sugar or maple syrup)

, A midday protein drink is a great way to bring your energy levels back up, and a homemade protein drink ensures you get all the vitamins and nutrients you need without any of the filler. In a blender, combine:1 banana, peeled
1 cup (150 g) regular or dairy-free yogurt
½ cup (120 ml) of milk or dairy-free milk
1 tablespoon (15 g) peanut butter
1 tablespoon (15 g) chia seeds
½ teaspoon (2.5 g) cinnamon

, Because of the excessive amounts of caffeine, sugar, and other stimulants, energy drinks are best reserved for emergency situations. If you're looking for ways to boost your overall energy, you can do this with proper diet, exercise, and getting enough sleep.To ensure you're getting all the vitamins and nutrients you need to keep your body healthy and energized, make sure you eat on a daily basis:


Fresh or frozen fruits of all colors.Plant-based or lean proteins, such as beans, legumes, nuts, seafood, or chicken.
Healthy carbohydrates, such as whole grains, pastas, breads, and tubers.Healthy fats, like those found in nuts, seeds, and avocados., Sleep isn't just necessary to ensure you make it through the day without falling asleep: it’s also essential to your brain and body, and without enough sleep, neither will function properly.


While everybody is different, anyone over the age of 14 needs between seven and 10 hours of sleep per night in order to give the brain time to rejuvenate.Caffeine consumption can actually create a vicious cycle, because while you might have a coffee after a long night when you didn’t get enough sleep, that caffeine can actually prevent you from sleeping properly the next night, which will result in you being tired again the following morning., Exercise increases your energy on two fronts. On the one hand, physical activity promotes blood flow, which carries more oxygen and nutrients to your cells, giving your body more fuel to burn. On the other hand, exercise also promotes better sleep, which in turn leads to you feeling more energized as well.To get the most out of your days, make sure that physical activity is a regular part of your routine.


Healthy adults should aim for at least 2.5 hours of moderate activity per week. This can include working in the yard, brisk walks, or leisurely swims.
Healthy adults who are more active should aim for faster paced exercises, such as swimming laps, jogging, or stair and hill climbing.

, Caffeine can be included in your life as part of a healthy diet and lifestyle, but moderation is the key. If you want to consume caffeine, try black coffee or tea instead of energy drinks.Coffee, which contains more caffeine than tea, should be consumed in small amounts over the course of a day, rather than all at once."

Petition local grocery stores to carry biodynamic food.,
Travel efficiently to distant biodynamic farms.,
Form a biodynamic co-op with interested people.",How to Choose Biodynamic Foods2," If you and a significant number of other people in your community want more biodynamic food at your local grocery store, talk with your grocery store Produce Manager. Let them know that you, and other customers, would prefer to see more biodynamic items in the store.


You might say something like, ""Excuse me, but my friends and I have been hearing a lot about biodynamic food lately. We'd like to buy more of it, but there aren't many of thee products in your store. Is there any way we could encourage you to stock biodynamic, or is there someone we could talk to in this regard?""
If the Produce Manager doesn't make any changes after your casual conversation, you can get your friends who are interested in biodynamic products to sign an official petition. Then, submit this to the General Manager., If you plan on driving to a biodynamic provider, the gas cost can add a considerable expense. Since biodynamic farms are still less common than traditional ones, you may have to travel quite a ways to reach one. Cut down on gas costs when driving by:


Carpooling with friends and others who want to buy biodynamic goods.
Taking turns driving with others interested in buying biodynamic.
Avoiding peak traffic times, especially stop-and-go traffic., Especially if you end up ordering biodynamic items in bulk, it may help to split this cost among several people. Talk to local friends, family, and neighbors to see if they'd be interested in splitting bulk orders with you in a community biodynamic food co-op.A thriving co-op might give you more bargaining power when trying to get local grocery stores to sell biodynamic products.
As your co-op grows, it might turn into a self-sustaining community provider of biodynamic goods. Many successful local co-ops eventually open a physical location.

Evaluate learning resources critically.,
Read books that investigate biodynamics.,
Learn provable benefits through scholarly articles.",How to Choose Biodynamic Foods3," Though there is much evidence that supports many biodynamic growing practices, this does not mean that all biodynamic methods are in fact sound.Many experts criticize some of the mystical agrarian techniques, like the practice of packing compounds into horns and burying these to harness ""terrestrial and cosmic forces.""When it comes to evaluating resources:


Take resources that have a vested interest in the topic with a grain of salt. For example, a businessman has a vested interest in convincing customers of his business-sense. If he didn't, he wouldn't get business. Similarly, a journal of biodynamics has a vested interest in proving the worth of biodynamics. If the topic were disproved, the journal would likely be discontinued.
Research that can be reproduced is generally considered to be sound. If you find several resources authored by different experts that come to the same conclusion, it's more likely the results are trustworthy.
Generally, resources that have passed ""peer review"" are considered to be the most trustworthy. Though peer reviewed articles are often clearly indicated, you can use online peer review checking services, like the free-to-use online service at researchconnections.org., Although not always the case, print materials are often much more carefully researched before publication. This makes books on the topic of biodynamics useful resources. Books can also give you a more complete sense of the evolution of biodynamics over time as well as contemporary practices. Some books you might consider:

Test ripeness by feeling how firm the avocados are.,
Check under the stem.,
Check for color and blemishes.",How to Choose Avocados2," Hold the avocado in the palm of your hand. Gently squeeze the avocado, being careful not to press with your fingertips, as this can cause bruising. A ripe avocado will be soft and will yield to the gentle pressure, but will not be overly squishy.If it is still hard, then it is still under ripe and will take a few days to ripen.
Avoid avocados which are overly soft and mushy, since this would mean that the fruit is too ripe.
Make sure to test out the entire fruit, and don’t judge ripeness by feeling the top of the avocado closest to the stem. This is the first part of the fruit to ripen, so it might be slightly softer while the rest of it is too firm.
Keep in mind you may still opt to purchase firmer avocados if you’re purchasing them a few days before their intended use.

, If the stem is still attached, give it a pull. If there’s any resistance, the fruit is not yet ripe. If comes off easily, and the area where it was is bright green, it’s perfectly ripe. If it’s yellow-green, it could use a day or so before being eaten. If the area where the stem was is brown or dark green, the avocado is overripe.Checking under the stem is one of the quickest and most reliable tricks for determining ripeness, and it removes the risk of damaging fruit by poking and prodding with fingertips.

, Hass avocados, which are the type you’re most likely to encounter at the grocery store, are green when unripe and dark green to near black when ripe. However, make sure you double check any signage posted at the market for the type of fruit and where it was grown. Most Florida avocados, unlike Hass, have lighter-green skin with yellowish tone, even when they are ripe.Avocados that are shiny are not yet ripe enough, but again, you can still purchase these and ripen them at home.
Choose avocados with unblemished skin. Avoid fruit with dark blemishes, brown spots, dents, and bruises.

Buy avocados based on your flavor preferences.,
Learn more about water and oil content.,
Choose avocados that are best for your diet.",How to Choose Avocados3," Once you begin to master how to choose ripe, good quality fruit, you may develop preferences for specific flavors and textures. Learn which varieties are nuttier or lighter in flavor.


Purchase the Hass, Lamb Hass, Gwen, Reed, or Sharwil varieties if you prefer avocados with a nutty taste.
Choose the Bacon and Zutano varieties for avocados that are lighter in flavor.

, Florida varieties typically contain more water, while those grown in California and Mexico are oilier. These fattier, more oily types are best for guacamole because of their rich texture. You’d also use an oily variety for skin moisturizers, while watery types are great for use in juices. These juicy types tend to have light, sweet flavors, and weigh up to five pounds.


Watery varieties include the Choquette and Hall.In addition to oilier varieties, types with thicker skins, such as Hass and Gwen, are also great for beauty use. Gently rub the peel or skin against your face in soft, circular motions, then rinse with warm water.While an avocado's size doesn't directly relate to its quality, it can help you determine where the fruit comes from and whether it has a higher water or oil content.
Larger avocados, some weighing up to five pounds, are typically from Florida and grow so large because of their high water content. Smaller avocados, with lower water content, are generally from California or Mexico.

, With evidence that avocados can lower cholesterol and decrease risks for certain cancers, more people are consuming avocados regularly or even daily. If you plan on consuming a large quality of avocados or eating an avocado a day, it might be best to consider choosing varieties that are less rich. Even though two-thirds of the fat an avocado contains is mono-unsaturated and considered healthy, they are still a fatty and high calorie fruit.Tonnage avocados are a great balance, as they have a rich texture but much lower fat content than most avocado varieties.While it’s the one you’re most likely to come across at the market, Hass avocados are among the fattiest varieties. Its relatives, like the Daily 11, are similarly oily and fatty.
Consider Florida-grown fruit for lower calorie, lower fat options.

Look for asparagus spears that are firm to the touch.,
Check the tips of the asparagus spears.,
Avoid blemished, mottled, or wilting asparagus.,
Look at the ends of the asparagus stalks.,
Choose the diameter of the spears according to your needs.,
Pick the color of asparagus you want.,
Choose the best type for the flavor you want.,
Put your asparagus in the refrigerator.,
Keep the stalk ends trimmed and damp.,
Make your asparagus last longer.",How to Choose Asparagus," They should be straight and not bendable; if you try bending the spear, it should be brittle and ""crack."" Stalks should be firm but tender.;
, For the main part, they should be closed tightly. A nice dark green or purple tinge on the tips is a good indication of quality. If the tips are yellowish or dried out, the asparagus is too old., If you do find asparagus like this on special and you're prepared to make soup, then grab a bargain. Asparagus with flowers is long past its prime, so avoid that at all costs., Your asparagus stalks should be moist and plump. If the stalks look dry, cracked, or “woody” they are probably older and you should find some that are fresher., The size does not affect the tenderness of the spears; rather, you should be looking for signs of freshness instead. Sometimes smaller asparagus is simply a better look for your food presentation but you will get more food from the larger stalks, especially if the price is per bunch.

, There are three different types of asparagus when you distinguish based on color. They vary in constitution as well as color. The three colors of asparagus are:Green – Green asparagus gets its color from the process of photosynthesis as the stalk comes out of the ground into the sunlight. This type of asparagus should be a bright green color with purple patches.

White – White asparagus is the same as green asparagus except that it is grown in the dark, so there is no color development from photosynthesis. Because it is grown more artificially (without access to direct sunlight), this type of asparagus is usually more expensive.

Purple – Purple asparagus is a different variety altogether. It derives its color from high levels of antioxidants in the stalks and has a lower fiber content than the green or white variety. This distinction makes purple asparagus tenderer and sweeter tasting.

, Thinner asparagus stems are typically more tender and sweeter. Bigger, fatter asparagus spears are usually meatier in texture and have a stronger asparagus flavor., Unlike some dry vegetables, asparagus needs to be stored in the refrigerator. Asparagus left out on the counter or in the pantry will go bad very quickly. For best results, keep your asparagus in the refrigerator so it will last longer.Try putting the asparagus in a plastic bag before you put it in the refrigerator.

, To help your asparagus stay fresh, trim the ends of the stalk before you put it in the fridge. Wrap a damp paper towel around the ends to keep the asparagus damp and help it retain its moisture., To help your asparagus last longer, especially if you won’t be using it for several days (up to a week) after purchasing it, cut off one inch of the stalks at the bottom and put the asparagus upright in a cup filled with a little bit of water (probably about one inch standing water).Put a plastic bag over the top of the asparagus and put it in the refrigerator.
If the water starts to get cloudy, pour it out and replace it with fresh water.
This will help your asparagus last many days longer.

Look for obvious bad spots.,
Look for cuts.,
Examine the color.,
Check the apple for firmness.,
Sniff the apple to detect foul odor.",How to Choose an Apple1," If you see spots that are rotten, dark brown, or too soft, the apple has likely already gone bad. Blemishes or lack of shininess do not automatically mean the apple is bad. Blemishes are a natural part of growing and are not the same as bruises or rotten spots.If you see a spot, gently wipe at it to see if it is just dirty or is a bad spot. Bruises may be small and not very deep, so these are fine because you can cut around them.
If the apple has a large bruise or is mushy, it’s probably rotten deeper into the apple and not just on the surface. These deeply rotten ones are the ones you want to avoid.;
, Besides bruises, apples sometimes get small nicks or slices during picking and transport. This causes some of the flesh to be exposed and turn brown. Apples with excessive cuts should be avoided as a lot of the flesh will be exposed and bad.


Again, a small cut here and there is nothing to worry about. You just want to make sure the whole apple isn’t covered in cuts.

, In general, apples tend to be a full red or slightly orange color when they are fully ripe. Granny Smith and Golden delicious are green and yellow, respectively, but otherwise an apple with a lot of green on it is probably not very ripe. You usually want to get the most red you can find.


Apples with a full color have absorbed a lot of sunlight, so they tend to be more flavorful than dull looking apples.
Apples won’t always be one solid color, but if half of the apple is still green (when it should be red) it has not ripened evenly and may not be the best choice.

, Hold the apple between your thumb and your index finger. Squeeze the apple gently. You don’t want to squeeze too hard or you will bruise it. If you give it a light squeeze and it doesn’t squish, this is a good apple. Squeeze a couple of spots around the apple to make sure the majority of it is firm., If an apple is getting past its prime freshness, you can often tell by the smell. Give the apple a sniff and if it smells bad, it probably is. Good apples will have a pleasant aroma, while apples that have gone bad will smell rotten.


It’s not an exact science but the smell is a strong indicator of quality.

Buy tomatoes from local farmers.,
Choose vendors that store tomatoes at room temperature.,
Purchase tomatoes shortly before eating.",How to Buy Tomatoes1," These tomatoes are less likely to have been treated with chemicals or pesticides and often cost less than mass-produced varieties.


Locally-grown tomatoes can be found at a farmer's market, at seasonal vegetable stands or in the section of your supermarket designated for produce from local farms.;
, Avoid refrigerated tomatoes.


Tomatoes kept in a grocer's refrigeration unit will break down faster in their cell walls, making them soften faster and lose some texture and flavor.

,


Buy tomatoes no more than a day or 2 before you plan to use them. This will ensure they are fresh and will prevent them from spoiling before you have a chance to eat them.

Decide what you want to do with the apple.,
Consult an apple guide.,
Go to the orchard when apples are in season.,
Look into organic or locally grown apples.",How to Choose an Apple2," If you are baking or eating apples fresh, you may want to buy different kinds. If you want to bake a pie but you choose apples that don’t bake well, your food won’t turn out. If you plan ahead what purpose the apple will serve, you can make a more informed decision about which to buy.Fuji, Goldrush, and Red Delicious are great options for salad because they don’t visibly brown quickly.
Jonamac, Spigold, and Cortland are recommended for apple butter because they retain flavor during cooking and pair well with the spices used.
For making applesauce, use Jonagold, Cortland, and Yellow Delicious. If the skin in red, you can leave it on for pink colored applesauce.

, Learning apple varieties will help you know better what to use different apples for. This is also helpful for personal preference, as some people like extra sweet apples and some prefer tart. Some apples are more crunchy and others are softer.For example, Red Delicious are a classic for snacking, but are not recommended for baking or using in sauces. On the other hand, Golden Delicious are great for both eating fresh and for pies and baking.
Sweet apples include Ambrosia, Honeycrisp, and Fuji. Granny smith and Jazz apples are known to be a little more tart and tangy.

, While people usually buy apples in the store, which is easier and more convenient, getting apples from an orchard guarantees they are fresh. If you are able to get to an orchard, it might be worth the extra effort to get apples that are not weeks or months old, as store apples tend to be.


Look online to find out if there is an orchard within driving distance of you and plan a trip. This can be a great activity for the whole family, not just a necessity trip.

, Apple growers tend to use a lot of pesticides to keep the trees free of bugs. So non-organically grown apples carry a lot of pesticides with them to the store. Organic apples are free of pesticides and are therefore healthier for you.Farmer’s markets are a great way to get fresh apples. There’s also a good chance they come from smaller orchards which might mean they are tended more carefully.
Buying locally also means a better chance of getting fresh apples because they don’t have to be transported from far away.

"
"
Pick apples that come off the tree easily.,
Pick apples toward the outside of the tree.,
Set apples gently into your basket.",How to Choose an Apple3," When you’re picking fresh from the tree, the best apples tend to come off easily when you pull them. Grab the apple, lift it up slightly, then gently twist. If it comes loose, it is probably ripe enough. If it’s hard to make it come loose, then it isn’t ready yet., Apples tend to ripen first when they are on the outer branches, so when picking from the tree, stick to the furthest out. If you know it is later in the season, or the outside of the tree has already been picked over, move toward the inside. This doesn’t mean that the apples on inner branches aren’t ripe at all, just that they ripen slower., When you are picking from the tree, or even buying in the store, it is important not to drop your apples into the container you’re carrying them in. It may be quicker to pick and drop, but you’ll bruise the apples and they won’t be as good to eat."
"
Separate apples from other fruit.,
Store apples away from strong smelling foods.,
Eat or use unrefrigerated apples within 1 to 2 weeks.",How to Choose an Apple4," Apples release ethylene gas over time. This gas causes other fruit to ripen faster, so it won’t last as long. Store apples in an unsealed plastic bag, and when you can, store them in an area of the fridge away from other fruit.You want to leave the bag unsealed so the gas will dissipate from the apples themselves, too. If the gas is trapped in the bag with the apples, it will cause them to go bad faster, as well.

, Apples can absorb smells from other food if kept in close proximity. It is best to store apples in a drawer of their own whenever possible. At least try to put them in the fridge as far as possible from strong smelling foods.To help keep apples fresh, store other foods in tightly sealed containers so the smell will be contained and not spread through the fridge. Onions are a good example of a food that will pass its smell to apples.
Other foods to keep sealed and away from apples are garlic, fish, and most types of pepper.

, You may choose to leave your apples out on the counter, which is fine. However, apples left out of the refrigerator will go bad much more quickly. Stored cold, apples can last 6-8 weeks, while room temperature apples only last 1-2 weeks.


If you buy apples that are not quite as ripe as you want them, you can leave them out for a few days and then move them to the refrigerator. They won’t last as long as those kept cold the whole time, but longer than if you leave them out.
Apples left out can also draw bugs, which is usually not an issue in the refrigerator.

Start with fresh green or purple grapes.,
Remove the larger stems from the grapes and wash them thoroughly.,
Place them on a tray.,
Place them outside in a dry sunny place (this requires warm, dry weather).,

",How to Make Raisins," Be sure they are fresh, ripe, not mushy or otherwise blemished. Check them carefully.;
, Do not remove all grapes from the stems. If you are unsure of their origin, a rinse in a diluted bleach solution (two drops household bleach in a quart of water) may be safer.

, Use a wooden, wicker, bamboo, or plastic tray that is slatted, so air can circulate around the fruit.

, If your climate produces night fogs or dew, take the trays inside at night.

, Rotate the fruit and/or trays to ensure even exposure to the sun.

Pick cherry tomatoes for salads and appetizers.,
Buy Roma tomatoes for use in pasta sauces and meat dishes.,
Purchase beefsteak tomatoes that are a uniform red color and have firm skin all the way around the tomato.",How to Buy Tomatoes2," Being small and round makes them ideal for these dishes. Buy them still attached to the vine if possible because they will be fresher. Look for bright red tomatoes with no blemishes.

, Roma tomatoes should be oval, dark red, and have no bruises at the ends., Beefsteak tomatoes are round and a paler shade of red than the Roma variety. Use beefsteak tomatoes on sandwiches or burgers or to make fresh salsa.

"
"
Squeeze the tomatoes gently.,
Examine the tomato's leaves and stem.,
Pick tomatoes from the top of the pile.",How to Buy Tomatoes3," Fresh tomatoes should have taught, shiny skin with a uniform red color. The skin should give a little when squeezed, but not feel mushy.

, The stem and leaves of the tomato should be green and should be tightly attached to the tomato. Brownish, loose leaves or stems indicate that the tomato has been sitting for a few days. The tomato shouldn't have any shriveled or soft spots.

,


Tomatoes in the middle or near the bottom could be bruised by the weight of the tomatoes on top of them and are probably older and less fresh than the tomatoes above.

Buy canned tomatoes to use in stews or slow-cooker meals.,
Read canned tomato labels carefully.",How to Buy Tomatoes4," Canned varieties will save you the step of chopping and seeding fresh tomatoes and will hold up better than fresh tomatoes in meals cooked for long periods of time.,


Canned tomatoes can be purchased whole, stewed, diced and crushed. Choose what type of tomato you need according to the meal you're preparing. Crushed and stewed tomatoes work well for pasta sauces, while diced or whole tomatoes can be used in chili and stew. When choosing your type of tomato, remember that canned tomatoes that have been diced or chopped will have preservatives added to them to keep them from breaking down in the can. Whole or stewed tomatoes will have fewer additives and can be diced at home if you have time.
Look for canned tomatoes that are labeled ""no salt added"" or ""no sugar added."" This label means that no additional preservatives have been added to the tomatoes, letting you better control the sodium and sugar levels in your finished meal.
Check expiration dates on canned tomatoes before purchasing. Be sure you will be able to use the can before it reaches the expiration date.

Examine the cantaloupe’s color and texture.,
Test the cantaloupe’s weight.,
Smell the cantaloupe.,
Check out the cantaloupe’s end stem.",How to Choose a Melon1," A good, ripe cantaloupe will have a base color that’s tinted gold, so avoid those that appear green. The skin shouldn’t have any tears or scars, and the netting on its surface should be thick, coarse, and strongly defined.If the cantaloupe’s base color still has a greenish tint, that usually means that it isn’t ripe yet.
It’s normal for the netting on the cantaloupe’s skin to be more pronounced in some areas than others.;
, Once you’ve found a cantaloupe with skin that appears healthy, pick it up and test its weight. The melon should feel fairly heavy for its size.To determine whether it is a good weight, you may have to test several cantaloupes from the store’s display. That will help you determine if one in particular feels heavy enough.

, One of the best ways to determine if a cantaloupe is ripe and healthy is to smell it. If the melon has a sweet, musky scent, it’s likely ripe and a good one to bring home.Smell the cantaloupe at the blossom end to test for ripeness. That’s the end of the melon that’s opposite the stem area.
If the cantaloupe smells perfume, that may be an indication that it’s overripe., Finally, before purchasing a cantaloupe, examine the stem area. Make sure that there aren’t any tears in the skin, as these can sometimes mean that the melon was harvested too early. There should also be a slight indentation in the stem area to show that the cantaloupe separated easily from the vine when it was harvested.The stem itself shouldn’t be attached to the cantaloupe. That usually indicates that the melon hasn’t matured.
Avoid any cantaloupes that are soft or moist in the stem area.

Prepare the cabbage for canning.,
Rinse the cabbage under cool water in a strainer, then drain the cabbage on cloth or paper towel lined trays for 6 hours.

,
Prepare pickling liquid.Combine the vinegar, sugar, mace and mustard seed in a large pot.,
Clean 7 glass quart (946mL) canning jars and metal lids with soap and hot water.,
Pack the clean jars with the cabbage.,
Wipe the rims of the jars with a clean cloth, stir gently to allow air bubbles to escape and cover with the metal lids.,
Place the cover securely on the canner and heat water to boiling.,
Process jars in the pressure canner for 20 minutes, adjusting the pressure based on your altitude (see guide below).Start timing when the necessary pressure is reached.,
Turn off heat and allow pressure to return to 0 PSI (0 kPa), then remove the weights or open the vent and wait for 2 minutes.,
Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter and place them on a wooden board or thick kitchen towel to allow them to cool in a draft free area.,
Label the jars with ingredients and the date, then store in a cool, dark and dry location.

",How to Can Cabbage," Select fresh, ripe cabbages that are free of blemishes, dents or bruises. Cut the cabbage into 4 quarters through the stem and shred it with a knife or food processor. Layer the cabbage with canning salt in a large bowl, cover and let stand for 24 hours.;
,, Then combine remaining spices in a cheesecloth or spice bag, tie to close, and add to the pot. Heat the ingredients to a boil for 5 minutes, then turn off heat.

, Keep the jars and lids hot until they are ready to be filled.


Jars and lids can be kept hot by placing them upside down in a pot of hot water or by washing them in a dishwasher and keeping them in the dishwasher until needed.

, Pour the pickling liquid over the cabbage to cover it completely, leaving 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of space at the top of the jars.

, Place the sealed jars on the rack in the pressure canner filled with 3 quarts (2.8 L) of hot water. The jars must not sit directly on the bottom of the canner, and should not touch each other to allow steam to flow freely around them.

, Allow steam to vent from the canner for 10 minutes before adding canner weights or closing vents. After 10 minutes close vents or put on weights (depending on the type of pressure canner you are using) and allow the pressure to build.

, Check the gauge frequently to ensure the pressure remains constant.


For dial gauge canners, set pressure to 11 PSI (75.8 kPa) for altitudes of 0 to 2000 feet (0 to 610 m), 12 PSI (82.7 kPa) for altitudes of 2001 to 4000 feet (610 to 1220 m), 13 PSI (89.6 kPa) for altitudes of 4001 to 6000 feet (1220 to 1830 m), and 14 PSI (96.5 kPa) for 6001 to 8000 feet (1830 to 2440 m).
For weighted gauge canners set pressure to 10 PSI (68.95 kPa) for altitudes of 0 to 1000 feet (0 to 305 m), and 15 PSI (103.4 kPa) for altitudes above 1,000 feet (304.8 m).

, Carefully remove lid and allow steam to escape.

, Keep 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of space between jars to allow air to circulate.


Listen for a small “ping” sound indicating that the seal of the jar lids has been sucked down and the jars are properly sealed. This could take around 12 hours.

Cut your plums and remove the pits.,
Place the plums directly on the oven rack.,
Set the plums in the oven at 200 degrees Fahrenheit.,
Check the plums every few hours.,
Heat your prunes for around 8 hours.",How to Make Prunes1," Slice the plums in half around the pit, working with a small, sharp knife. Pull the halves apart, remove the pit, and discard the pit.Make sure you work with a knife small enough to handle. A large knife is not appropriate for cutting plums.;
, Do not use a baking pan to make prunes in the oven. A lot of juices will leak from the plums during the drying process. If plums are on a baking pan, they will stick to this surface. Instead, use an oven rack. Make sure to space the plums evenly on the oven rack. If the plums are touching, this may affect the dehydration process.As the process can make a mess on the bottom of your oven, consider setting something down to catch the drippings. Some people find success laying a single sheet of foil on the bottom of the oven. However, the foil may melt and it does not work for gas ovens.You could try lining a baking tray with foil and setting that under the plums.

, You should set the oven as low as possible. For most ovens, that is 200 degrees Fahrenheit. If your oven is different, simply set the oven to the lowest possible temperature.Make sure to place the oven rack in the oven slowly. You do not want to knock the plums around., You should flip the plums every few hours so they dry out evenly. You should also check on how the dehydration process is coming along. You want your prunes to be slightly soft and juicy, while also being dry to the point of having a wrinkled, dark appearance.This also depends on personal preference. Some people prefer prunes slightly dryer while some prefer them juicier. Do not remove the prunes until they're at your desired state.

, While most prunes will be ready at this point, vigilant checking is important. Some prunes will be ready sooner than 8 hours, and some will need a little more time.The prunes will probably be ready at slightly different rates. Remove them as needed.

Go to a home improvement store and buy a pair of the snug-fitting, chemical-resistant gloves.,
Select a gallon-size (or more) glass jar or pottery crock.,
Get the largest, plumpest, ripe peppers from the garden or market.,
Choose whether to leave the seeds in or remove them.,
Wash the peppers and dry them with a towel or paper towel before processing them.,Remove and discard the stems.,
Survey the seed extraction methods.,
Weigh the remaining peppers.,
Get out the calculator and calculate 3.3% of the remaining weight.,
Process the peppers in a blender two pounds at a time.,
Add other vegetables, herbs, and spices to the blender if you desire and puree them along with the pepper mash.,
Pour the mash into the fermentation jar or crock.,
Set the jar out of direct sunlight and extreme temperatures and wait for it to ferment.,
Stir the mash down each day with a clean spoon once the bubbling starts.,
Screw the lid down tightly onto the jar one month after making the mash and put the jar in a refrigerator.,
Use the mash as soon as fermentation has ceased.",How to Make Habanero Pepper Mash," Don't get normal surgical gloves or purple ones used for blood work.

The gloves need to fit against the skin snugly and not allow capsicum from the peppers to seep through and get into your skin.
If you ignore this, the peppers you handle will make your hands have a burning or throbbing sensation for hours, possibly all day. When handling the peppers or seeds, wear these gloves.
When through, make sure to wash the gloves well and rinse with plenty of water before removing them. To be extra safe, wash your hands as well and rinse with copious amounts of water. This will prevent the capsicum from the peppers and seeds from irritating your sensitive skin and membranes, should you happen to touch these areas.;
, You will not want to fill the container more than ½ to ¾ full of mash because fermentation bubbles will make the mash rise up and overflow the jar.

One pound of peppers will produce a little less than a pint of pepper mash, so you will need 5 pounds to fill your gallon jar half full. If you don't process the peppers immediately, refrigerate them.

, Red or orange habanero peppers which have ripened fully on the bush will start rotting within a couple of days after picking them, so use them immediately.

Fully ripe peppers have a delicious sweetness to them, in spite of any heat. If you bite into one, you will feel a rush of sweetness, then the heat will hit you and you might regret taking such a big bite. The sugars that give the peppers a sweet taste will help fermentation.

, Contrary to popular opinion, the seeds don't contribute much to the heat of the peppers. The real heat comes from the connecting veins that attach the seeds inside the peppers to the pepper walls. You can always use the seeds for planting more peppers.

If you intend to save the seeds for planting, don't save the seeds from puny, stunted peppers. Save those from the biggest, fattest peppers for planting. That way you will have more fat peppers in your next harvest.

, Do not wash them before refrigerating them. Water makes them decompose faster.

If you plan to save the seeds, use a sharp paring knife to slice into each pepper and pry it open with your fingers, then scrape the seeds out, one pepper at a time. Try to leave the veins in the peppers. Set the seeds aside in a small bowl so you can lay them out on a paper towel to dry after you finish.

,,

If you use a juice extractor, it might ruin any seeds, so that you can no longer use them to grow new plants. However, you can still spread them on paper towels and dry them in a food dryer or in an oven at 110℉ (43℃) for a day. You may then pulverize the seeds in your blender at high speed, then put the resulting dust in a salt or pepper shaker.
Instead of using a blender, you may also push the peppers, with or without seeds, through a juice extractor. This will extract the seeds and a good amount of the pulp. Cycle it through the juicer several times to get out as much of the pulp as possible. Use the output of the juicer for the fermentation process. You may also juice additional vegetables as discussed below.

, If you started with 5 pounds (2.25kg), you should have 4.5 pounds (2kg) or more remaining., For simplicity, add 1 tablespoon of salt per pint of mash.

If you have 2.1 kilograms, multiply that times 0.033. You will get 69.3g, the weight of the salt you will need. A tablespoon of salt weighs 15 grams and a teaspoon 5 grams. 69.3/15 = 4.62 tablespoons. So, you need four and two-thirds tablespoons of salt for 2100 grams of mash.

, Pour one tablespoon sea salt per pound of peppers in a blender and process them on high speed until they become puree (mash). This will be no more than a minute at the very most, typically only 15 to 30 seconds. Do not over-process..You don't want to produce so much heat that you kill the bacteria naturally residing in the peppers because that bacteria is essential for fermentation the process., Be careful, though, to maintain the salt-to-weight ratio of the vegetable matter. Adding various vegetables and fruits will dramatically affect the taste of the finished product, so a purist pepper sauce lover should consider making the pepper mash first, and then, with a portion of it, blend other vegetables for further fermentation.

Here are some examples of additional vegetables and fruits.

Carrots (They are sweet and maintain color)
Onions
Garlic
Horseradish
Ginger
Chinese cabbage
Apples



, Ideally, you should fill the crock no more than ⅝ full (a little over half) to allow for rising of the mash during fermentation. When you finish the blending, pour the mash into the jar and put a lid on the jar loosely., Make sure to avoid freezing temperatures and temperature above 110℉ (43℃) or the fermentation agents (bacteria) will be killed.

In one week, the pepper mash will start bubbling vigorously as the fermentation process takes hold. During the process, the bacteria produce acetic acid while the sugars are converted to alcohol and carbon dioxide gas bubbles which will cause the pulp in the mash to rise, leaving the liquid and some solids on the bottom.

, If it seems about to overflow, pour part out it into another glass jar until the bubbling subsides, then mix them back together.

In another week or two, the fermentation should stop producing bubbles. Note, though, that bacteria still lives in the mash.

, Keeping it cold and sealed will inhibit mold growth., Suggestions:

Spoon it sparingly (because of the heat) onto your food.
Add a tablespoon to a batch of bread dough to create a delicate pepper aroma and add a lovely heat to sandwiches and toast.
Make a tantalizingly piquant fudge with it.
Add it to sour mash for brewing beer.
Make pepper sauce by combining three ounces of mash and two ounces cider vinegar. This will create a delicious, pure, and hot sauce which is best stored in a standard 5 ounce hot sauce bottle. Vary the proportions to suit your taste. With the vinegar in it, you do not need to refrigerate it. You need no other ingredients.

Put the bananas in a paper bag.,
Add other fruits to the bag.,
Put the bag on top of your fridge.,
Add humidity in dry weather.,
Check the bag periodically.",How to Make Bananas Ripen Faster1," Bananas produce ethylene gas, a hormone that triggers ripening.Keep them in a paper bag to trap more of this gas near the fruit.


Avoid paper bags with a clay or waxy coating, which may absorb the ethylene.A plastic bag blocks oxygen from reaching the fruit, which can sometimes lower the production of ethylene.;
, All your bananas need to ripen is a bag, some warmth, and their own ethylene. However, you can add other fruit if you have it. Some other fruits also release ethylene, ripening nearby fruits. The best options are apples, pears, apricots and similar pit fruits, avocados, kiwi, and quince.Other bananas will help as well, but the effect is low unless they're already ripe.


Use the ripest fruit you can find, or cut the fruit to encourage more ethylene production.
Even other fruits, leafy vegetables, and tubers sometimes produce ethylene if they are severely wounded.If you have no other options, cut them many times and add them to the bag.

, Heat significantly speeds up ripening in bananas. The ideal ripening temperature for flavor and texture is about 65–68ºF (18–20ºC).This is about room temperature in a heated home. Keeping it in a warmer location, such as on top of the fridge or over the stove, may speed up ripening. The result might be less evenly ripe, but this shouldn't matter much for home use.

, Low humidity may slow ripening or affect flavor.If the weather is dry, run a humidifier in your kitchen, or leave out shallow pans of water.


However, you should keep your bananas away from damp areas, which may encourage mold. Nearby water is fine, but a very moist and enclosed area is not the right environment.

, The bananas will usually ripen within 48 hours, but it can take several days if the bananas are still green. Check once or twice a day, since the fruit stored with the banana will quickly become overripe.

Look for a watermelon with dull skin and a uniform shape.,
Find a watermelon with a creamy patch on the underside.,
Check the texture of the watermelon’s skin for bumps and dents.,
Test the watermelon’s weight.,
Tap your knuckles against the watermelon.",How to Choose a Melon2," While a watermelon should be a bright green color, its skin shouldn’t be shiny. Instead, look for one with skin that’s slightly dull. It should also have a uniform shape to indicate that it’s matured fully.If a watermelon’s skin is shiny, it may indicate that the melon isn’t ripe.

, Next, pick the watermelon up and examine the bottom. There should be a creamy yellow spot from where the melon rested on the ground as it was growing. This field spot indicates that the watermelon spent plenty of time in the sun maturing instead of being harvested too early.The deeper the color of a watermelon’s field spot is the sweeter the melon will be. A white spot is fine, but a yellow spot is best.

, As you’re holding the watermelon, run your fingers along its skin to examine the texture. There shouldn’t be any dents, bumps, or irregular curves, which can indicate that the melon didn’t get regular sun and water as it grew. Instead, choose a smooth, even melon.Make sure that there aren’t any cuts or scars in the watermelon’s skin either.

, With the watermelon in your hands, make sure that it has a good weight. It should feel heavy for its size, so compare it with another melon that’s a similar size to see if it has a good heft to it., Finally, hold the watermelon a couple of inches from your ear and knock on it with your knuckles. If the melon is ripe, it should make a hollow, tenor-like sound.The knocking test shouldn’t be used as the only test for ripeness because not all watermelon farmers agree that it is accurate. Overripe watermelons can sometimes make the same sound as ripe fruit. Use it to confirm that a melon that meets all of the other criteria is ready to bring home.If the watermelon makes a thudding sound when you hit it, it is likely still full of water and not yet ripe.

Examine the honeydew’s skin for a rich, creamy color.,
Choose a symmetrical honeydew.,
Feel the honeydew’s skin.,
Check the honeydew’s scent.,
Shake the honeydew and listen to the sound.",How to Choose a Melon3," A healthy, ripe honeydew will be a cream, yellow, or gold color. Avoid melons that are overly green because they aren’t ripe yet.If you choose a honeydew that’s a creamy white color, it won’t be ripe yet but will ripen if you leave it out at room temperature for a few days., A healthy ripe honeydew will have a spherical shape. More important than looking at the shape, though, is to make sure that the melon you choose is symmetrical. If one end is larger than the other, it can indicate that the honeydew didn’t grow evenly and probably isn't the best choice., Run your fingers along the skin of the honeydew to examine its texture. It should have a smooth, velvety feel with no noticeable dents or bumps.It’s also normal for a honeydew’s skin to have a slightly waxy feel because the sugar in the melon rises to the surface as it ripens.

, Just as with a cantaloupe, you can usually tell if a honeydew is ripe by sniffing it. It should give off a sweet, pleasant scent.A honeydew’s scent will be most evident when the melon is at room temperature.

, Finally, before purchasing a honeydew, shake it gently. If you hear the seeds rattling around inside, the melon is ripe. If you shake the honeydew and it sounds soupy or slushy inside, that likely means it’s overripe."

If you don't have a pairing knife, you can use another sharp knife. However, be sure to avoid a large knife. Plums are small, and you want to make sure you maintain control of your knife as you cut around the pit.

, It's a good idea to push the plums close together, as this will eliminate the need to do two batches.However, make sure the plums are not touching. This is important for air circulation, which allows the plums to dry properly., You should dehydrate your foods at 115 °F (46.1 °C) when working with a conventional dehydrator. However, if you have an excalibur dehydrator, start out at 145 degrees.Make sure the dehydrator is at the right temperature before placing the plums in the oven.
Place the tray in the dehydrator slowly to avoid knocking the plums together.

, You want to turn the plums at some point to complete the dehydration process. Check every 4 to 6 hours to see if the plums are ready to turn.When plums are ready to turn, the upside should be very dry. The plums should release easily from the tray.
If the upside of the plum is still moist, and the plum does not come off easily, leave the plums for a bit longer before turning them.

, The plums will turn into prunes at different rates. When you notice some plums completely lack moisture, they've completed the pruning process. These should be removed from the dehydrator. After this, start checking on the plums ever 2 hours, as they're getting close to being done., Plums will take roughly 14 hours to fully dehydrate. However, they may take longer or shorter depending on the quality of the plums. This is why it's important to check your plums regularly during the dehydrating process. When fully dehydrated, you will have black, wrinkled, raisin-like prunes."

If you don't want to make your bananas completely black, set your oven to the lowest setting instead. This will normally be about 170°F (77°C).

, Cover the baking sheet with parchment paper to catch leaks from the mushy bananas. Place unpeeled bananas on this sheet. Don’t crowd them, as you want the warm air to circulate.








, Turn the oven light on so you can keep an eye on the bananas. Watch the bananas blacken, and check on them after the first 15 minutes to see if they've softened. If they don't seem soft after 30 minutes, you might want to try them for another ten., Once your bananas are out, you can poke them gently with a spoon to see if they're soft. Wait until they're cool enough to handle before adding them to your banana bread ingredients.


If you're not ready to use them yet, you can store them in your fridge without losing any flavor.

, Cut off the tip of the peel with a pair of scissors, then squeeze the banana from the bottom to push out the fruit. Alternatively, you can just slice the peel down the side and topple the banana out, or scoop it with a spoon."

Prunes can be safely stored in the pantry, the refrigerator, or the freezer.

, The shelf life of prunes depends on where you store them. Make sure to know the shelf life of your prunes to avoid eating spoiled fruit.In the pantry and fridge, dried prunes will last 6 to 12 months.
The freezer can extend the shelf life of a dried prune. Dried prunes stored in the freezer can last 12 to 18 months.

, If it's around Thanksgiving, dried prunes can make a tasty addition to any stuffing. When sautéing other items for the stuffing, like onion and celery, toss in the prunes as well. Cook everything together for a few minutes, and then remove the mixture from the heat.Prunes can add a slightly sweet flavor to a stuffing, which can shake up a stuffing made with mostly savory ingredients.

, You can stuff prunes with Stilton or another type of cheese for a sweet and savory appetizer. You simply cut the prunes through the center and then fill them with cheese.Stuffed prunes would make a great snack for an elegant dinner party.

, Prunes can compliment beef nicely. Usually, you would add the prunes, in addition to any other garnishes, about halfway through the cooking process. However, refer to your specific recipe to make sure this is safe given the type of roast you're making."

You will not be dehydrating the chicken in the oven. You should, however, cook the chicken for a brief time in the oven before you dehydrate it in order to kill any bacteria living inside. The heat provided by the dehydrator is insufficient for this task.;
, Use a sharp kitchen knife to slice the chicken into strips that are 1⁄8 to 1⁄4 inch (0.3 to 0.6 cm) (3.175 to 6.35 mm) thick.


The thinner the strips are, the more jerky you will have and the less time it will take to dry the meat.

Buy fruit juice or squeeze your own.,
Coat the sliced bananas in the juice.,
Use or store the bananas.,
Revive discolored banana slices with pineapple or grapefruit juice.",How to Keep Sliced Bananas from Discoloring1," There are several fruit juices that can keep banana slices from turning brown. You can use fresh juice or storebought varieties — it doesn't matter. See our juicing guide if you'd like to make your own. Either way, you won't need much — a half cup or so is plenty for one or two bananas.



Lemon juice is the most well-known juice used for keeping fruits from turning brown. It works just as well for bananas as it does for apples.However, there are many other juices that work well, including:
Lime juice
Orange juice
Tinned pineapple juice
Tinned or fresh grapefruit juice
Apple juice;
, To do this, you can sprinkle the juice over the slices or dip the slices into the juice. You can also immerse the slices in the juice and leave them there for a few minutes, allowing them to soak up some of the juice. This can be great for keeping them fresh-looking but may affect their taste a little more than normal.


Another quick way to coat the bananas is to put them in a sealed plastic bag with the juice and gently turn it over a few times.
To minimize any change to the flavor of the bananas, use the juice sparingly or place it in a spray bottle and spritz it over the slices.

, Once they're soaked in fruit juice, the bananas will take much longer to turn brown. Whether you're eating the slices raw or making a pie, fruit kabobs, a parfait, or a fruit salad, you can trust that your bananas will look fresh well through the end of the meal. They should even last without refrigeration in a plastic container for a few hours — perfect for packed lunches.


Even with the fruit juice, banana slices are best consumed the same day. The cold temperatures of refrigerators can turn the peels brown, but if you're OK with this, the fruit itself should remain fresh.If you do refrigerate the slices, be sure to put them in an airtight container with as little air in it as possible.

, If your banana slices are already brown, all is not lost. You can lighten discolored banana slices by immersing them in tinned pineapple juice or grapefruit juice for 10-15 minutes. They won't quite return to their original pale yellow color, but they will look fresher and more delicious.

Mix with the back of a spoon until the red food coloring is evenly distributed. This could take a few minutes.
Mix in a circular motion for best results.
When done, the mixture should have a paste-like consistency.
Note that this particular type of pork jerky is called bak kwa.

, Wrap the bowl containing the meat mixture with cling wrap and let it sit for 2 to 3 hours in the refrigerator.

, Use the back of a spoon to spread the meat mixture out on a piece or parchment paper until it is only about 1/5 inch (5 mm) thick.


Make sure that the parchment paper is sitting on a flat countertop.
Spread the pork mixture out into as even a layer as possible.
If the meat begins to stick to the spoon, brush the spoon with a little vegetable oil before continuing to flatted out the meat.

, Gently press the wire mesh into the top of the pork mixture, only applying enough pressure to create a faint pattern on top of the meat.


Rub vegetable oil on the wire mesh first to ensure that it does not stick to the meat.
Wire mesh can usually be found near the barbecuing supplies at any grocery store, market, or kitchen supply store.

, Carefully slide the sheet of meat onto a dehydrator tray and place the dehydrator tray back into the dehydrator.


If you have difficulty moving the entire mass of pork, you can cut it into several pieces before moving it over.

Finished.

",How to Make Jerky4," Beef jerky is one of the most popular types of jerky. Start with a lean cut of meat, like flank steak or top round, and dehydrate fine strips of the beef in a dehydrator or oven.

, You can add different seasonings and marinades to your strips of beef in order to create more flavorful beef jerky.



Spice things up. You can make a spicier version of beef jerky by adding a little capsicum sauce.

Try teriyaki beef jerky. Soy sauce, brown sugar, paprika, and red pepper combine to form Asian-inspired flavors.

Prepare South African beef jerky. Also referred to as biltong, South African beef jerky is prepared with sea salt, white pepper, malt vinegar, white vinegar, and raw brown sugar.

, Venison, or deer meat, is another popular meat to use for jerky. It goes well with seasonings like onion powder, black pepper, garlic powder, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce.

, While traditional jerky is prepared in strip form, you can also use the dehydrating method to prepare beef jerky in sticks.

, If you do not have a meat dehydrator, you could also dehydrate the jerky in a conventional oven or in a saucepan.

Use soda water.,
Use tap water.,
Use diluted citric acid.,
Use diluted vinegar.,
Use dissolved vitamin C. Ascorbic acid, or vitamin C, is another acid that can keep fruit from turning brown.,
Limit exposure to air.",How to Keep Sliced Bananas from Discoloring2," Fruit juice isn't the only thing that can keep bananas from turning an unappealing brown. For example, soda water and club soda are known for their ability to keep sliced fruit fresh.Best of all, these liquids have the added benefit that they don't affect the taste of banana. Use them as you would use fruit juices, soaking the slices in the soda water before serving or storing them.


Be sure to use soda water or club soda. Tonic water, a beverage that looks the same, has a strong flavor that doesn't go well with bananas.

, Tap water doesn't work quite as well as fruit juice or the other solutions in this article, but it's something you'll always have available and it's basically free.This, too, is used the same as the fruit juices: soak the banana slices in the water before using them how you wish.

, Citric acid (the same chemical that makes citrus fruits like lemons sour) is sold in a purified form as a canning additive. In this form, it is specifically used to keep fruit from discoloring as it stores. However, it's often difficult to find pure citric acid. Your best bet will usually be a health food store or a hardware store. Luckily, it is not especially expensive — less than $10 for a small bottle is common.To use citric acid, add three teaspoons to a cup of water and mix. Soak the slices in the bath as normal. Don't use undiluted citric acid, as it is far too sour.

, Vinegar can be used similarly to citric acid to keep fruit fresh. However, its strong sourness also makes it necessary to dilute it. As with citric acid, add a few teaspoons to a cup of water to make a bath and soak the banana pieces as normal.

, Powdered vitamin C can usually be found in most supermarkets as a cold-fighting supplement. Dissolve this in water (according to the directions on the package) to make a bath and soak the banana slices as normal.


If you're in a pinch, a ground-up vitamin C tablet works as well.

, Since banana slices turn brown when they are exposed to the oxygen in the air, keeping the fruit from physically touching the air will prevent the browning reaction from occurring. There are many ways to do this. A few are listed below.


One easy trick involves wax paper. Cut the slices so that they are all about the same slice, then lay them on a tray. Cut a square of wax paper to fit the tray, then lay it down over the slices and gently press it down so it sticks to each. The banana slices will be sandwiched between the paper and the tray without any air exposure.
If you have the time, you can also cut small squares of wax paper of plastic wrap and lay them individually over each slice. Be sure to remove them before you eat.If you have a vacuum storage device (e.g., Food Saver, etc.), you can also try packing the slices in an air-free container.

Simmer your raspberries, sugar, and water.,
Strain the fruit.,
Add flavorings.,
Add the culture.,
Drink the soda after about three days.",How to Lacto‐Ferment," The knife you decide to obtain depends on the use you will be putting it towards. For instance, if you are grating vegetables, the knife you use should differ from one that is best suited to slicing or chopping.Paring knives are good for small, short, and precise tasks like peeling or trimming off vegetable skin.Serrated knives are good for slicing veggies. They have scalloped edges and should give you a smooth, clean slice.
A chef’s knife can be used for many purposes, but is best when working with large produce like spaghetti squash or pumpkin.;
, Glass canning jars (Mason jars, especially) are the most common container for lacto-fermentation. These jars have metal lids and seal tightly to keep the fermentation process simple., While it is not absolutely necessary to keep your veggies completely submerged during the lacto-fermentation process, doing so will encourage probiotic growth and prevent mold. To accomplish this, you will need to add a small weight to the glass canning jar to press down on whatever you’re fermenting. The weight should have the same (or nearly the same) diameter of the jar you’re using.The best weights will be of dense but thin glass. This way, they will consume a minimal amount of room inside the glass canning jar.
Avoid using limestone weights, as they can dissolve in the acidic environment of the glass canning jar.Do not use wooden weights, as they will expand in the aqueous environment.

, If you intend to ferment sauerkraut or other veggies that ferment in their own juices, you’ll need a pounding tool (sometimes called a tamper) to break the vegetables apart and compress them in the glass canning jar. You might have such an object at home – a rolling pin with one handle removed works well – or you could buy a product specifically designed to compact veggies for lacto-fermentation., For quart-sized canning jars, mixing two cups of filtered water and one tablespoon of sea salt should yield enough brining liquid for the lacto-fermentation process. Set the liquid aside.If your glass canning jar is larger or smaller, just scale the proportions accordingly.

, Adding herbs and spices to your lacto-fermenting veggies will give the final product a pleasing flavor. You could use dried chili peppers, bay leaves, fresh basil, fresh tarragon, fresh mint, or black peppercorns. Add one or two teaspoons of each herb and spice you wish to use.Add these herbs and spices in any combination you desire, but it’s best not to overdo it. You should probably limit the number of herbs and spices you utilize to three or four.

, Cut and dice your vegetables down to the size you want. You can slice, dice, or grate your vegetables. Some veggies, like beets or baby carrots, can be tossed in the glass canning jar without being altered at all. Once your veggies are ready, pack them in the glass canning jar, leaving enough room to add your weight (if you’re using one).Consider adding a mixture of vegetables to a single glass canning jar.
If you’re making sauerkraut, use the tamper to push the kraut into the jar.

, With your veggies and spices in the glass canning jar, pour the brining liquid in to cover them. Fill the jar to a point about half an inch (one centimeter) from the top, or to a point that leaves enough room to add your weight (if you’re using one)., If you’re adding a weight, place it on top of the food you’re lacto-fermenting. Then, close the glass canning jar tightly to prevent air from disrupting the process., Fermentation occurs best in a temperature of between 18 and 22 degrees Centigrade (64 to 72 degrees Fahrenheit).Place your glass canning jar in a climate controlled space to achieve the desired temperature.An absence of light also helps the fermentation process along. Place the jar in a dark closet or cover it with a thick cloth.

, After two or three days, the lacto-fermentation process will start. To prevent excess buildup of gasses, slowly twist the top of the sealed glass canning jar until you hear gasses start to escape. Twist it closed quickly. Repeat daily.Some specially-designed canning jars include an airlock that automatically ejects carbon dioxide from the vessel as it accrues. Such vessels do not need to be burped.
Consult manufacturer directions for more information about whether burping your glass canning jar is necessary.

, After two to four days in a cool-to-room-temperature location, the vessel should be moved. The target temperature is about four degrees Centigrade (40 degrees Fahrenheit). For small batches, the bottom shelf of the fridge works nicely., There is no single “right” time to end the lacto-fermentation process. Most people wait one to three weeks to allow the lacto-fermentation process to work. Once you’ve waited on the lacto-fermentation process as long as you wish to, remove the vessel and sample the flavor.You can always replace the lid and allow the fermentation process to continue for longer (though removing the lid of the glass canning jar will slow the momentum of the process).
Experiment with the lacto-fermentation process by waiting a longer or shorter time before tasting the product. This will allow you to achieve the flavor you want.

, Combine four cups berries, one cup sugar, and two quarts (1.9 liters) water in a medium-sized pot. Turn the heat to high, then reduce to medium once it reaches a boil. Simmer the ingredients for 30 minutes.You could use raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, or another sweet berry to make your soda.

, After 30 minutes has elapsed, remove the ingredients from the heat and allow them to cool. Place a strainer over your glass canning jar, then slowly pour the ingredients into the jar. Discard the fruit solids collected in the strainer., If you want to make a hybrid flavor, you can add other fruit flavorings to the canning jar. For instance, if you wanted a lemon-raspberry soda, you could have used raspberries in your original mixture, then, after straining, you could squirt a teaspoon or two of lemon juice into the mix.Other popular flavorings include peppermint or spearmint.
There is no wrong combination of soda flavors. Use whatever flavorings you like.

, The culture will kick-start the fermentation process. The most common option is 1/2 cup (64 grams) of whey. Add it to your glass canning jar. If you don’t have any whey, you could use an equal amount of champagne yeast., Tightly close the jar and place it in your cupboard. Wait about three days before sampling your soda. If you want a less sweet soda, you can wait four or five days.You should be able to see your soda fizzing through the glass. This is a sign that it is ready to drink.
When you’re ready to serve, pour your soda over ice. Enjoy drinking your lacto-fermented soda with friends.

Remove the core from crisp lettuce heads.,
Wrap the lettuce in paper towels.,
Store in a plastic container.,
Place in the crisper drawer.,
Watch the container.",How to Keep Lettuce Fresh1," Iceberg, romaine, and other lettuce with a stiff core last longer when this core is removed.Cut out the core with a knife, or pound the stem against a cutting board firmly, then twist the stem to remove the core by hand.Do not remove the stem from butter lettuce, or any lettuce with loose, tender leaves.;
, Sandwich the head of lettuce — or loose leaves in single layers — between two soft, absorbent paper towels. These will absorb excess water but keep the lettuce in the moist conditions it prefers.If the lettuce feels dry, dampen the paper towels.If the lettuce is wet enough to soak the towels, squeeze them out and wrap the lettuce again in the same, moist paper towels.If the lettuce is a bag of loose leaves, spin them dry in a salad spinner.

, This can be a zip-locked bag, hard plastic container, or even a salad spinner. If using a bag, press out some of the air before sealing, without bruising the leaves. If using a hard container, fill it at least halfway with leaves.The more air in the container, the faster you'll get brown edges.If you press out all the air and seal the container completely, the lettuce may develop off flavors due to poor respiration.Leaving a little air or cracking the container slightly may be a better idea, especially with leaf lettuce or a fridge that's on the warm side.

, This is the coldest part of your fridge, which is ideal for leafy greens. Most grocery store lettuce should last 3-7 days here, depending on freshness, while iceberg may last up to two weeks.Fresh lettuce from your garden or a farm stand may last longer.


Do not squeeze the leaves into tight spaces with other foods, which may cause bruising.
Do not store in the same drawer as apples, pears, or tomatoes, which release high amounts of ethylene gas that can cause spoilage.

, If water is running down the sides of the container, lower your fridge's humidity settings or open the crisper drawer's air vents wider. (You may also want to drain out the excess water.) If you see ice in the crisper drawer or on the leaves, raise your fridge's temperature."

Exhale into your own personal cut lettuce supply.,
Add a stronger carbon dioxide source.,
Vacuum seal crisp lettuce in a glass jar.",How to Keep Lettuce Fresh2," Carbon dioxide can reduce browning and increase shelf life in cut lettuce. One easy way to add CO2 is to exhale a small amount into the bag of lettuce, then seal it.For sanitary reasons, do this only with lettuce you plan to eat personally.


Carbon dioxide is not beneficial for intact lettuce heads.

, This clever way to add carbon dioxide can increase your lettuce's lifespan by five extra days, in the best case scenario. Here's how to set it up:Freeze 1 tsp (5mL) white vinegar in a spice jar or other small container.
Pour 1 tsp (5mL) baking soda onto the frozen vinegar.
Leave the lid off the jar, and cover with several layers of paper towel. Fasten with a rubber band.
Keep this jar upright in a sealed container of lettuce. The vinegar will slowly melt and react with the baking soda to create CO2.

, If you have a vacuum-packing machine, you can use it on a jar of iceberg lettuce to keep it fresh for up to two weeks.Romaine lettuce typically lasts a week when vacuum sealed. This does not work well with butter lettuce and other tender leaves.You can imitate a vacuum packing machine with a much cheaper (but less effective) hand pump. Punch a hole through the jar lid with a thumbtack, cover it with electrical tape, and pump air out through the tape.This will not work with a plastic bag of lettuce, as the leaves will be crushed in the vacuum."

Choose a good cooler.,
Make and use ice blocks.",How to Keep Food Fresh on a Road Trip1," A good-quality cooler will ensure your food stay fresh throughout the whole road trip. Make sure you find a cooler that has a drain so you can release melted ice from it. You should also pick a cooler with a lid gasket to form a airtight seal that stores cold air inside, as well as a strong latch to seal the cooler properly. You may want to consider getting two or three coolers on your road trip to store and organize your food and beverages separately. ;
, While crushed ice and ice cubes cool your food faster, they don't last as long and melt quicker. Ice blocks last longer and can keep your food cold for several hours, including food that's stored into plastic containers. You may also want to make your own ice blocks by freezing water into jugs or large plastic containers. This can help you save money and can you prevent you from buying ice blocks at the store."

Over to the right, create a linear subtotal for each line, and a Final Net (Within)/Over Budget cell that tells you where you're at, net, month-to-date. Be aware that some people tend to spend a little more when their paycheck arrives, or items go on special at the store, or per their household's needs per shopping period, so be prepared to adjust the straight division  amounts accordingly. However, the monthly budget total should equal your actual monthly budget, regardless of these special considerations -- you just have to revise other periods for the difference(s).

Beef is from two-year old cattle.,
Understand common ranch terms.,
Understand the difference between cattle and veal.",How to Understand and Shop for Beef2," A two-year old steer would produce an average of 450 pounds of meat. There are at least 50 types of cattle used in butchering to produce beef for the consumer's table.


Major cattle used for human beef consumption include Angus, Hereford, Charolais, and Brahman. The Angus cow is famous for being from Scotland and is seen on many a cattle ranch.
One of the most commonly raised cattle in the United States is the Hereford cow. The Hereford cow is known for producing well marbled meat much akin to the Black Angus cow. Charolais cattle are primarily used to breed larger calves. A Charolais bull is often crossed with a Hereford cow to produce a larger calf leading to higher beef yield.
Brahman cattle are akin to wild cattle and are rarely used in US ranching. ,



Calving: Calves are typically born in the spring usually during the last blizzard of the year. Calves may have to be ""pulled"" if the calf is too large for the cow giving birth.

Genetic Diversity: Most ranchers usually keep one ""papered"" bull per 50 cows to promote genetic diversity. A ""papered"" bull is one that has documented lineage. Branding: Branding is typically done in the spring when calves weigh between 200 to 300 pounds. Vaccinations for Black Leg are given and the cow is branded and given an ear tag. Ear tags are considered a separate form of identification. Bulls are castrated during branding and become a Steer. All cattle with horns except Bulls are de-horned during branding.

, Veal is from beef cattle. Veal comes from calves weighing approximately 150 pounds and is less than 3 months old. Veal is milk fed and the meat is pink in color. "

, Shopping at Asian markets and translating packaging and ingredients may be difficult. Pre-made lists and resources like Kian's Chinese Cooking Starter Kid can be helpful for getting started and learning how to stock your pantry for Asian cooking.

, These are a base for many Asian meals. Regular brown or white rice doesn't have the right consistency for Asian cooking. Choose jasmine or basmati rice for versatility; they're used in Chinese food and other dishes. For Japanese cooking, look for Japanese short grain or sushi rice.

, There are various types of soy sauce; it's best to use a soy sauce made for the type of cuisine being prepared. The ones most useful are light and dark Chinese soy sauce. Light soy sauce is table soy sauce. Dark soy sauce has been aged and is thicker and darker. Japanese soy sauce includes Shoyu and Tamari, which are slightly sweeter.

, Brown rice wine is similar to dry sherry and is used in most Chinese recipes. Sesame oil is most often used in cold dishes and other recipes. Cooking requires high heat and oil with a higher smoke point, like vegetable, soybean, canola or peanut oil.

, While they can be made from scratch, it's most convenient to have pre-made sauces on hand. Oyster sauce is a commonly used in Chinese food. Fermented fish sauce, called ""nam pla"" is another essential ingredient. Look for clear, sediment free, amber colored sauce. Curry pastes, most often used in Thai and Indian cooking, include red, yellow and green pastes. Shrimp paste is used in Chinese and Thai sauces, soups and other dishes.

, Starch is used to thicken sauces. Tapioca starch is used in traditional Chinese sauce.

, Some of the spices most used in Asian recipes include cloves, dried hot chili, cardamom, cinnamon, cumin, turmeric, coriander, garam masala, curry, Sichuan pepper, star anise and white pepper. Five spice powder is a mix that includes fennel, Szechuan peppercorns, cloves, and star anise.

, Both are made from soy and are low in calories and high in protein and beneficial bacteria.

, There are various types of vinegar. White rice vinegar is lighter and used in sauces and stir fries. Black rice vinegar has a smoky flavor, while red rice vinegar is tart and sweet. Vinegars are often used for dipping sauces with Chinese food, as well as cooking.

, Palm sugar is made from sap of the sugar palm tree and is used in many sweet dishes.

Spaghetti and marinara sauce are easy and quick. Another version with similar ingredients gives you rigatoni and sauce.
Egg noodles, canned chicken and Alfredo sauce from a jar quickly rival eating out when you add a can of sliced mushrooms. A quickly thrown-together salad finishes the meal.
Lasagna noodles in your pasta purchase combine with spaghetti sauce, mozzarella cheese and cottage cheese for homemade lasagna. Pizza you created yourself is a fabulous treat.

,


The above ingredients have you almost all of the way there. You still need dough for the pizza crust, onions, olives and peppers for several dishes.
Seasoned breadcrumbs, canned onion rings and tortilla chips make great garnishes for casseroles.
You will use broth, spices, dehydrated onion, pepper sauce, mustards, relishes and sun-dried tomatoes more often than you can imagine.

Store the bread at room temperature.,
Avoid storing the bread in the refrigerator.,
Pick a storage option based on the type of editor.,
Freeze leftovers.,
Thaw the frozen bread properly.",How to Keep Homemade Bread Fresh for Longer," Make sure that you keep your bread at a normal room temperature – preferably at 68 degree Fahrenheit or 20 degrees Centigrade. Ensure that it is kept away from direct sunlight in a dry and cool place.;
, Scientific tests have shown that storing breads in the refrigerator sucks out all the moisture from them thereby making them stale at a faster pace. This happens as result of a process known as “retrogradation” wherein the starch molecules start to crystallize together.

, There are a few rules of thumb that you can use while storing and packaging different kinds of breads. These are as follows.


Sandwich breads should be stored in plastic bags. Breads that are processed and sold as slices usually come pre-packed in plastic bags. As advised by manufacturers themselves, these sandwich breads should be stored in the plastic bags to retain their moisture. Even though moisture-laden plastic bags aid in the development of mold, these breads come with preservatives that slow down the early onset of mold growth.
Artisanal breads should be stored in paper bags. Artisanal breads remain crispy when stored in paper bags. Bakers that make crusty artisanal breads swear by this mantra. Storing these breads in a plastic bag will only make the crispiness turn spongy.
Use foil to protect the sliced ends of freshly baked breads. Foil is a great material to keep the sliced ends of freshly cooked bread soft.
Artisanal breads can also be left out in the open. Unsliced bread can be left on the counter with the cut side facing down. This is a tested method for home cooked bread or freshly cooked bakery breads. Cover the bread with a kitchen cloth to protect it for a longer time.

, Leftover bread should be frozen to prevent it from going stale. Slice the bread before freezing. Store it in an airtight freezer bag or wrap it in foil.

, Frozen bread would require room temperature thawing bread basket and thaw it properly. You can also toast it in the oven for a little while – not more than five minutes – to regain its crispiness.

Plan ahead.,
Start with the basics.,
To réchauffé Vegetables - Should you have a range of fresh vegetables for steaming, sometimes it better to steam the whole vegetable (like cauliflower & pumpkin) rather than have raw leftovers that may rot or go stale.,
Cooking like this means that you don't have surplus raw ingredients and you can reheat or serve a different way to save time.

,
With surplus boiled eggs, use them in sandwiches, curried eggs, scotch eggs or in salads.

,
With surplus roast, grilled, poached or steamed meat, it can be used in sandwiches, salads, curries, braises, Bolognese sauces, casseroles, soups etc, minced for rissoles, or sliced thinly, marinaded and used as another antipasto snack.

,
Rice can be easily reheated or used in fried rice, pasta can be used hot or cold in salads.

,
Surplus breads can be used for breadcrumbs in a food processor, bread and butter puddings, panades, sliced and baked or fried as croutons or garlic bread.

,
Cakes can be used in trifles, crumbled & mixed into ice-cream (similar to cookie ice-cream), covered with hot stewed fruits or heated with custard etc.

,
Fruits can be cut raw for fruit salads or stewed.,
Stocks and sauces can be used as a foundation of other sauces, soups or stews.,
Surplus raw cream may be used into butter, sauces, custards, ice-cream, baked desserts such as crème brulee or whipped and used in trifles.

,
Planning in advance on ways to use surplus food and reduce waste is the whole goal.

",How to Rechauffé food," If you have purchased more than you would serve in one sitting (such as a large chicken), plan the next meal to use up the surplus chicken. This is the principle behind réchauffé food. It is not taking scraps off the plate.;
, With washed vegetable scraps that are free of any dirt or mold such as peelings and ends can be used if they are not or poor condition. Here is a range of uses:


Brown or red onion skins, as well as beetroot peelings can be used as a natural dye in soups or stocks.
Potato peelings can be seasoned with spices and baked until crisp for a low fat snack.
Carrot, onion & celery trimmings can be used in stocks.
Egg shells (free of any raw egg yolk) are an old fashioned way of clarifying stocks. Simply add them and simmer gently for a few minutes or until clear, skim any egg white that rises to the surface as egg white also helps to trap particles for removal.
Most other peelings are really only useful for the compost or the bin.

, You can use the surplus the next day in different ways.


For cauliflower, the surplus can be chilled and reused in dishes such as cauliflower cheese, or marinaded in vinegar and spices and used as an antipasto, served in a salad, used in soups or pureed and reheated.
Potatoes can be fried, roasted, used in salads, soups or mashed for mash, gnocchi, breads or hash browns & bubble & squeaks.
Cabbage can be reused in bubble & squeak, salads, marinaded in juniper berries, salt & vinegar as a sauerkraut antipasto.
Pumpkin can be used in scones, breads, soups etc.
Carrots can be reheated and served with honey and a little butter.

Blanched Green beans can be sauteed quickly in a pan with a little hot butter, chilli or soy sauce, or some fresh chopped herbs. Or served cold in salads.

,,,,,,, Surplus stewed fruits can be served in pies, puddings, with oatmeal and porridge or with ice-cream and custards.

, If you have a lot of milk, make a larger batch of bechamel to reuse fresh in a lasagne, some souffle recipes or cauliflower cheese, tuna mornay etc.

, The skin should come off, starting to reveal the seeds. Very few seeds should come off with the skin. If there is excess skin sticking the body of the fruit, peel it away, too.


On the top, a bit of the calyx may still be lodged into the fruit, depending on the fruit and where you made your slice. If it is, remove it gently.

, Again, don't pierce all the way through. This is just so you can ""unwind"" the fruit later.

, With the vertical incision you just made, pry open each disk, exposing a line (and then two) of pomegranate in front of you. Each row of pomegranate will display several large chunks of the juicy, tasty seeds.

, The two center halves will be busting full of the arils, while the top and bottom sections can be discarded. That's how you open a pomegranate -- how you eat it is up to you!

"
"
Cut the pomegranate in half, top to bottom.,
Grab a large bowl and fill it with water.,
Coax out the seeds with your fingers.,
Get out your strainer.",How to Open a Pomegranate3," No need to cut off the calyx or any part of the pomegranate -- just in half. If you're concerned with juice getting everywhere, score it around the midsection.

, If you have two halves, place them face down in the water. If the fruit is just scored, pry it open (forming two parts) while the fruit is submerged, also placing the fruit skin side up. This will keep the juice from getting everywhere.

, The white pith will float and the seeds will sink. As you get closer and closer to the skin, you'll be able to invert the fruit, getting all the seeds, even the ones closest to the edge. When you're finished, you'll be left with the skeleton of the pomegranate, like two inverted caps.

, Dispose of the skin, skim off the white piths (tossing those in the trash, too), and just strain out the water. Tada! Seeds in a bowl. Every single one 'em.

"
"
Hold the pomegranate so the stamen end is up.

,
Lightly score the fruit around the horizon line.

,
With your fingers along the cut line, pull open the pomegranate so you have two halves.

,
Place one half, seed side down, in the palm of your hand.

,
With a wooden spoon hit the skin of the pomegranate hard until the seeds fall freely.,
Repeat with the other half.",How to Open a Pomegranate4,",,,, Do this over a bowl and be sure that you're not wearing light colors.

, This should take about 30 seconds to de-seed the entire fruit.

Cut the grapefruit horizontally at its center.,
Cut along the rim of the grapefruit.,
Cut around the grapefruit wedges.,
Cut out the membrane if desired.,
Garnish with sugar if you want.,
Place the grapefruit halves in a bowl.",How to Prepare Grapefruit for Serving1," Take a large, sharp knife and cut the grapefruit horizontally into two halves.If you are unsure where the top and bottom of the grapefruit are, find the two dots, or navels, on the grapefruit at opposite ends. These are the top and bottom of the grapefruit.
Think of these dots as the “poles” of the grapefruit, like the poles of the earth. Turn the grapefruit on its side and cut where the equator line would be, through the center of the grapefruit.;
, Cut along the line of the grapefruit where the skin and the sectioned flesh of the grapefruit meet. Use a small, serrated knife to cut along this circle. Try to keep as close to the skin as possible so you are not cutting away any of the fruit., Take the serrated knife and cut in diagonals around each wedged section of the grapefruit. Essentially you are freeing the fruit of from the skin and the membrane of the grapefruit. , You can stop here if you wish. However, some like to use a scissors or knife to cut out the membrane around the fruit of the grapefruit.


This is fairly work-intensive, and you will probably lose a little bit of the fruit as you are cutting out the membrane.
Many like doing this because by the end you will be able to easily eat the inside of the grapefruit and won't have to concentrate on scooping out each section.

, Many people sprinkle sugar on top of grapefruit to counter its tart flavor. If you wish, sprinkle about a teaspoon of sugar over the grapefruit. The grainy texture of the sugar can also be a pleasant counterpoint to the softness of the grapefruit. , Grapefruits prepared in this way fit perfectly into bowls. Put each grapefruit half in a bowl that is a similar size. Accompany the grapefruit halves with a small spoon. To eat the grapefruit, use the spoon to scoop up fruit of the grapefruit. The fruit should easily dislodge from the grapefruit since you spent the time to cut around the membranes.

Remove the stems of the tomatoes, then turn the tomato over and score a shallow X into the bottom of the tomato using a sharp knife. This will help to make peeling easier., Use a spoon or a strainer with a long handle so that they don't drop in and splash you with boiling water., Don't leave the tomatoes in the water for any longer than 30 seconds, or else they will begin to cook and become mushy.

,


Place them immediately into the bowl of ice water you left beside the stove. This will cool the tomatoes down and stop any cooking that may have begun.


, When the tomatoes are cool enough to handle, remove them from the ice water. The skins should be wrinkled and loose. Grab a corner of skin where you marked the X earlier and pull. The skin should come off very easily. Continue working your way around the tomato until all of the skin has been removed. If the skin is sticking at any point, you can use a small serrated knife to cut it away., You can also seed the tomato, if necessary. Then continue with your recipe, as normal."

Peel off the skin of the grapefruit.,
Peel off the excess skin.,
Split the grapefruit into sections.,
Arrange the sections on a plate.",How to Prepare Grapefruit for Serving2," Peel off the outer skin of the grapefruit just as you would do for an orange. Grapefruit skin is thick, so if you are having trouble making the first peel, knick the skin with a knife and peel away from this incision., After you peel away the skin, you will probably see a whitish layer around the outside of the grapefruit. Use your fingernails to peel off this layer. You can also use a knife to cut it away if you prefer.You won’t be able to peel this off all at once. Instead, peel it off in little strips or use a knife.

, Take the peeled grapefruit and separate each section. There should be about twelve sections to each grapefruit. If you want, you can cut away the membranes. The membranes add a bitter taste to the fruit, so some prefer to cut them off. However, it isn’t necessary., Take the sections of grapefruit and pile them onto a plate. To eat the grapefruit, just take a slice and enjoy! This is one of the easiest ways to prepare grapefruit.


Because the membrane is slightly bitter and tough, some prefer to prepare grapefruit in a way that removes the membrane from the fruit.

Cut away the outside skin.,
Cut away the fruit from the membrane.,
Place the fruit on a plate or in a bowl.",How to Prepare Grapefruit for Serving3," Instead of cutting the grapefruit around the center, cut the grapefruit top to bottom at each navel, or pole. This should give you two equal sized grapefruit halves., Lay each grapefruit half flat side down on a cutting board. Take a sharp knife and cut away the skin. You can also try peeling the skin with your fingernails, but a knife may work better to also get off the white layer of membrane inside the skin. , Take the serrated knife and cut each section of fruit away from the membrane. Cut as closely as you can to the membrane, so you are not leaving any fruit behind on the membrane. When you are done, the fruit should be separated into wedges, and membrane should be left behind. , The fruit of the grapefruit is fragile when separated from the skin and membrane, so be careful as you move the wedges to a plate. Sprinkle with sugar if you like. Eat either using your fingers or spear with a toothpick. "

This will give you two equal grapefruit halves., Stand one grapefruit half up on a cutting board so that the “pole” of the grapefruit and the open part of the grapefruit are horizontal to the cutting board. Using the sharp knife, cut ¼ inch slices of grapefruit. Do this for both halves of the grapefruit.Be very careful that your fingers don’t get in the way of the knife.

, Take the sharp knife and cut each circular grapefruit slice into a half-moon shaped slice. You can stop here, or if you want smaller wedges, cut the half-moon shaped slices in half to create triangular slices.

, Take the knife and cut a small slit into the fruit of each grapefruit wedge. Take the wedges and put them on the rims of glasses or cups; the slit will help the grapefruit stay put on the rim.If you are not preparing any beverages, you can also simply put grapefruit cut in this way on a plate to eat.

Strain the grapefruit juice.",How to Prepare Grapefruit for Serving5," Half the grapefruit at its center through the “equator”. This should give you two equal grapefruit halves., Put the manual juicer on top of a glass with the pointed side up. Take a grapefruit half and start to rub it into the pointed end of the juicer. You should see juice being released. Keep turning the grapefruit around in circular motions as you gently press it against the juicer. You may need to use multiple grapefruits to get the amount of juice you want.

, After you have released all the juice from both grapefruit halves, take a strainer and pour the grapefruit juice into another glass. This should remove any seeds or large pieces of pulp from the juice. Drink the grapefruit juice straight from the glass.

Buy inexpensive cuts of meat.,
Trim off remaining connective tissue.,
Leave the fat on the meat.",How to Mince Meat1," Choose shoulder or flank meat for minced beef, pork, or lamb. Stick with dark meat for chicken and turkey. These cuts are cheaper and have the right amount of fat for proper mince. Better cuts of meat like rib eye or chops are not usually ground up.If you are not sure exactly what to buy, ask the butcher or a person at the meat counter of your local grocery store.;
, When you get the meat home, check it over for any tendons, connective tissue, or cartilage that may still be on it. Use a sharp knife to cut off these portions and throw them away. When you grind up the meat, these tissues will be noticeable in the mince if you don’t remove them.







, Proper minced meat contains fat, so be sure not to cut all of it off while you are cutting the other parts. It’s okay to cut some of the fat if you are aiming for a lean minced meat, but it will mince and cook better if you leave some of the fat on it.

Cut the meat into chunks.,
Freeze the meat and the food processor for 20-30 minutes.,
Place the meat into the food processor in small batches.,
Pulse the food processor until the meat is chopped.",How to Mince Meat2," Using the sharp knife, cut the meat into one to two inch (2.5 cm to 5 cm) cubes. They do not have to all be the same size, and they don’t all have to be exact cubes. Use 1-2 inches and cube-shaped as a guide that can be adjusted to the specific pieces of meat you’re using.







, Lay the meat chunks in a single layer on a baking sheet. Place them in the freezer to firm up. This should be at least 15 minutes and up to about 30 minutes. They should become firm but not frozen. Place the blade and bowl of the food processor in the freezer, too.








Chilling the meat gives you cleaner cuts and keeps the fat from melting during the chopping process. The same concept applies to the food processor. A cold blade and bowl chop better.

, To make sure the food processor runs well and chops the meat evenly, don’t fill it excessively full. Throw a couple of handfuls of meat into the processor at a time. The size of your food processor will ultimately determine how much you can mince at one time.







, If your food processor has a pulse setting, use this as opposed to a setting that runs non-stop. Pulse the meat at a speed of 6-8 for a few seconds at a time, checking the meat after 3-4 pulses. The meat should begin to form a ball around the edges.








It is better to leave the meat less chopped than to over-process it. If you end up with a smeary paste, you’ve definitely processed it for too long.

Chop the carrot in half.,
Slice the halves down the middle lengthwise.,
Cut each carrot piece into four.,
Divide all of the smaller carrot pieces into thirds.",How to Julienne Carrots1," A whole carrot is usually too cumbersome to julienne, so it helps to cut your carrots into smaller pieces. Use a sharp chef’s knife to slice the carrot in half horizontally.If a carrot is particularly long, you may want to cut it into three or four pieces. You’ll have the easiest time julienning pieces that are approximately 3- to 4-inches (8 to 10 cm) long or smaller.
It’s important to work on a cutting board so you don’t damage your countertop or other surface while you’re julienning the carrots.;
, Take your carrot halves, and use your knife to cut them each down the middle lengthwise. Be careful to curl your fingertips out of the way because the round shape of the carrot means it may move as you’re cutting.If your carrot keeps moving as your trying to cut, you may want to slice a small piece off on one side to create a flat surface to steady it.
The safest positioning when holding a carrot for cutting consists of your fingertips bent at the top knuckle, so that your fingernails are vertical to the carrot. You can also apply slight pressure with your fingernails as a means of holding the carrot steady from this position

, Place the carrot pieces with the cut side facing down to steady them. Slice each piece into four equal pieces with your knife.The pieces that you cut should be rectangular in shape.

, Take each of the four carrot pieces, and use your knife to cut them into thirds. If you want even thinner pieces, you can cut them into more pieces until the carrot sticks are as thin as you want.The finished julienned carrot pieces should resemble matchsticks.

Slice the meat into long chunks.,
Cut the meat into thinner strips.,
Freeze the meat for 20-30 minutes.,
Grab two knives.,
Chop the meat rapidly.",How to Mince Meat3," Using a sharp knife, cut the meat lengthwise into long chunks. Use either a meat cleaver or another chopping style knife. The slices should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick on all sides, so if you have a thicker cut of meat, trim it down to this size.








The pieces can be as long or short as you want.

, Now cut the strips lengthwise again to half of their current size. You want the strips to be thin before you start mincing the meat further. Lay the cut strips out in a single layer on a cookie sheet.








, Just as you would when mincing meat with a food processor, chill the meat before you begin to cut it. You’ll get cleaner cuts and better chopping with cold meat. Chill for at least 15 minutes to firm up the outer edges without freezing the meat solid.







, For fast and efficient mincing of the meat, use two sharp knives that are meant for chopping. The sharper the knife and the bigger the blade, the easier it will be to chop the meat. If you only have one knife that is good for chopping, perform the next step with one knife., With a knife in each hand, chop down onto the meat repeatedly with hammer-like motions. Scoop the meat into a pile, and turn it in a circle as you go. Continue chopping, piling, and turning the meat unto it reaches a consistency of tiny pieces.








If you are mincing a lot of meat, you may want to perform this step two or more times with a portion of the meat. If you try to chop too much at once it will not work as well.
Always practice safety when you are chopping meat with sharp knives. Be sure to keep both hands out of the way of the knife in the other hand.

Find a carving class.,
Purchase carving tools.,
Practice often.,
Use your knives safely.",How to Learn Fruit and Vegetable Carving1," Many eastern culinary schools, gourmet Asian restaurants, and chefs host fruit and vegetable carving classes. Do an online search to find classes being held in your area. If you can’t find anything, consider taking an online course. You can either pay for a series of specialized video classes or watch free classes on Youtube.

If you have a chef friend, ask them if they have any recommendations on where to learn fruit carving.;
, You will need a paring knife, a vegetable peeler, a melon baller, a “u” shaped garnishing tool, and a “v” shaped knife.You can get several different sizes of “v” shaped knives. If you purchase a range of sizes, you will be able to make many different kinds of cuts.

These tools can be purchased at specialty cooking supply depots or online.
Purchase a knife sharpener as well. If you sharpen your knives they will create better cuts.

, Start by peeling apples, yams, cucumbers, or any other fruit or vegetable with skin. Next, practice paring fruits and vegetables to get comfortable with your paring knife. Lastly, experiment with your other tools, such as your “v” shaped knife, to figure out the different kinds of cuts you can make.

For example, the “v” shaped knife is especially good at making thin, clean grooves. If you use smooth movements, you can make straight lines or graceful curves.
When using the paring knife, practice making straight cuts and curved cuts.

, Fruit carving can be very dangerous. Always carve away from your fingers, not towards them. Sharpen your knives often to prevent them from getting stuck in thick fleshed vegetables and fruits. If they encounter too much resistance, you may apply too much pressure and accidentally cut yourself.Consider purchasing protective woodcarving gloves. These gloves will insulate your fingers against the sharp edge of a knife.
If you carve a juicy or slimy fruit or vegetable, wash the handles of your tools often. This will help prevent them from becoming too slick to use safely.

Set the mandoline on a flat surface.,
Choose the julienne or stick blade on the mandoline.,
Place the carrot on the food guard.,
Run the carrot over the blade to cut.",How to Julienne Carrots2," While a mandoline is often safer to use than a knife, it is still extremely sharp and can be dangerous if you don’t use it properly. Make sure to set the tool on a flat, even surface, so it doesn’t move around as you’re julienning the carrots.The best surface to put the mandoline on is a cutting board that is secure on your countertop so it won’t move around either.

, Mandolines typically come with multiple blades that allow you to cut vegetables and fruits in a variety of ways. For julienning the carrots, you’ll want to use the julienne blade. On some models, it may be called the stick blade.On some mandolines, you have to attach the julienne or stick blade manually. On others, you simply move the blade into place. Consult your instruction manual to see how to adjust the blade.
If your mandoline has multiple julienne or stick blades, pay attention to the thickness to ensure that you julienne the carrot to the right size.

, Because the blades on a mandoline are so sharp, you run the risk of cutting yourself if you move the carrot directly over the tool with your hand. Most models come with a food guard, which serve as a barrier between your hand and the blades. Stick the carrot on the prongs on the guard to ensure that it’s firmly in place.If your mandoline didn’t come with a food guard, you can purchase one separately.
If you feel like you don’t have control over the carrot with the food guard, you can also purchase a stainless steel mesh hand glove that protects the hand holding the carrot from the blades.

, When the carrot it firmly on the food guard, run it over the blade to julienne the carrot. It typically takes several swipes over the blade with the carrot to julienne the entire piece."
"
Wash the carrots.,
Peel the carrots.,
Trim the carrots.",How to Julienne Carrots3," When you get the carrots home from the grocery store or farmer’s market, they may still have dirt and bacteria on their skins. To prepare them for julienning, rinse them under cool water and scrub them with a vegetable brush under the running water.








If you plan to peel your carrots, you don’t necessarily need to scrub them.

, It’s safe to eat carrot skin, but some people don’t like its slightly bitter taste. Before julienning the carrots, you may want to use a Y-peeler to remove the skin, particularly if it’s very thick.








When you’re running the peeler over the carrots, try to use a single stroke from the top to the bottom to keep the shape of the carrot as uniform as possible.

, To ensure that your carrots are ready for julienning, it’s important to trim them. Use a sharp chef’s knife to chop off the blunt edge at the top of the carrot, as well as the tip. Depending on what method of julienning that you’re using, you may need to chop the carrot further.

Etch a leaf pattern into the skin of the cucumber.",How to Learn Fruit and Vegetable Carving2," You will need a cutting board, a carving knife, and a washed medium-sized cucumber.Choose a cucumber that has smooth even skin and feels firm when you squeeze it.

If you want to make smaller leaves, you can either use smaller cucumbers or cut a large cucumber in half.

, First, cut one of the rounded ends off of the cucumber. This cut end will be the small end of the wedge. Next, diagonally slice the cucumber lengthwise, leaving the uncut rounded end as the thickest part.

Discard the removed cucumber parts or chop them up and add them to a salad.

, Lay the cucumber on your cutting board with the flat side against the board. Carefully cut away the sides of the cucumber to shape the top into a rounded point. Lastly, scoop out the seeds and soft flesh from the underside of the cucumber using a small, rounded spoon., Use the carving knife to cut two shallow parallel lines down the center of the leaf shape. Stop carving about one centimeter away from the tip of the leaf. Next, carve away a small amount of the green skin around your parallel lines . This will reveal the white flesh of the cucumber and create a green center vein.Carve away less than you think you need to. You can always carve green away, but you can’t add it back.

, Remove the skin of the cucumber to create a leaf shape on the cucumber. Use the green center vein as a guide. The edges of the leaf should move away from the center vein in a jagged line.Cut the edge of the cucumber to match the edge of the leaf shape. Leave about a centimeter of green skin between the white leaf pattern and the edge of the cucumber.

Soak the radishes in ice water.",How to Learn Fruit and Vegetable Carving4," You will need a large v-shaped carving knife, a standard carving knife, a cutting board, and a freshly washed radish. Choose a medium-sized radish with smooth, unbroken red skin. The tops of the radish should be green, not wilted, and the roots should be bright white., Use the standard carving knife to gently slice away the leaves in layers. Once the leaves are removed, you will see a pale red stalk. This stalk will help you pick up the radishes and hold them while carving., Press the v-shaped carving knife into the skin of the radish to make long, pointed cuts. This carving technique will create triangular leaves in the flesh of the radish. Work from the bottom of the radish to the top, alternating the rows for a realistic effect. Carve the petals about one centimeter deep into the flesh. If you carve too deeply, the “petals” won’t open.

, Fill a bowl with cold water and ice. Drop the radishes into the bowl and let them soak for an hour. This will open up the petals of the flower and give the radishes a realistic natural appearance."

Create a fruit bowl with a carved melon.,
Arrange a platter of carved fruit and vegetables.,
Create an edible bouquet.",How to Learn Fruit and Vegetable Carving5," After carving a watermelon into a bowl shape, you can fill the bowl with melon balls or your favorite fruit salad. Choose fruits that go well with watermelon. For example, you could make a salad with blueberries, strawberries, cantaloupe, and watermelon.

Avoid using easily bruised fruits like raspberries. They will disintegrate in the salad.

, Find a large ceramic, wooden, or glass platter. Next, place your carved fruits on the platter. Arrange the largest carved foods in the center of the platter and the smallest around the edge.If your platter still seems empty, add slices of fruit and vegetables or a few handfuls of berries.

, Press some floral foam into the bottom of a vase or ceramic flower pot.Next, skewer your carved fruit and veggies on bamboo sticks. Stick the other end of the skewer into the floral foam to create a bouquet.

Grapes, cherry tomatoes, and fruit and vegetable slices are great additions to an edible arrangement.

Peel and slice a carrot into coins.,
Use a small round cookie cutter to create a circle in each coin.,
Cut notches around the circle with a diamond-shaped cookie cutter.",How to Make Carrot Flowers3," Take a medium or large carrot and use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin. Next, take a sharp knife and carefully slice the carrot into coins. Make sure that they coins are ¼-inch (½-cm) thick or less, or you may have trouble cutting the flowers.If you have a mandoline, you may find it easier to cut the carrot into coins with it.

, Find a small round cookie cutter that’s smaller in circumference than the carrot coins. Press it into the center of the carrot coin to create a perfectly round circle.If you don’t have a round cookie cutter that’s small enough to fit inside the coins that you’ve cut, you can use a small plastic cap from a bottle or other household item to cut out perfectly round coins.
While the round cookie cutter will give a symmetrical circle, you don’t necessarily have to use it. If you’re comfortable with the finished carrot flowers being slightly irregular, you can skip this step.

, When you’ve used the round cookie cutter on all of your carrot coins, use the edge of a diamond-shaped cookie cutter to cut out small “V” shapes around the entire edge of the coins. That will form the petals for the flowers.If you don’t have a diamond-shaped cookie cutter, you can cut out the “V” shapes using a sharp knife.

Peel the carrots and trim off the ends.,
Run a zester along the length of the carrot to create notches.,
Cut the carrot into coins.",How to Make Carrot Flowers4," Take a medium size carrot, and remove the skin using a vegetable peeler. With a sharp knife, trim off the ends of the carrot to get the thickness as close to uniform along the entire length as you can., Instead of using a knife to cut out notches, drag a citrus zester along the entire length of the carrot. The notches won’t be as deep as they would be with a knife, so the flowers will have a delicate, frilly look when they’re finished.For this method, you can’t use a grater or microplane style zester. You need a traditional zester that features a series of sharp holes at the end of a handle.

, After you’ve run the zester along the entire length of the carrot, use a sharp knife to slice it into coins. You can make the coins as thick or thin as you like, and each will have the notches to create the subtle flower shape."

Peel the carrot.,
Shave the carrot with a vegetable sharpener.,
Remove the carrot shavings from the sharpener, and curl into a flower shape.,
Stick a toothpick through the bottom of the flower to hold its shape.",How to Make Carrot Flowers5," Take a medium size carrot, and use a vegetable peeler or knife to remove the skin. It’s important to remove all of the skin so that when you run the carrot through the sharpener, you’re only shaving off the flesh and not any of the skin., Do this until you have enough flesh to form a flower. Use a vegetable peeler that resembles a pencil sharpener and insert the carrot. Turn it to shave off the outer layers of flesh in one continuous strip. Shave the carrot until you have enough shavings to create the size of flower that you want.You can use a traditional vegetable peeler or even a knife to shave off the carrot flesh too. However, it’s more difficult to keep the shavings in a continuous strip with one of those tools, so work slowly and carefully.

, When you’ve shaved enough flesh from the carrot, carefully take the shavings off the sharpener, going slow to avoid tearing them. Using your fingers, curl the shavings into a flower shape by wrapping them around themselves.Because of the way the peeler shaves the vegetables, the carrot flesh will naturally curl in on itself, so follow the natural curve to make shaping the flower easier.

, After you’ve shaped the carrot shavings into a flower, take a toothpick and push it through the bottom where the ends of the savings overlap. That will help the flower keep its shape, so you can place it on a plate as a garnish without worrying about it coming undone.The toothpick should be able to pierce the shaved carrot flesh on its own, but if it doesn’t go through easily, use a knife to create a small hole that you can push the toothpick through.

Buy soda water.,
Decide how to flavor your soda.,
Choose a sweetener.,
Mix the soda.",How to Make Soft Drinks1," Go to the grocery store and buy a liter or two of plain soda water. Look for a brand that doesn't contain sugar or any other additives. All you need is plain, carbonated water.


If you have a carbonation machine at home, there's no need to get carbonated water at the store.
You can also buy ""sparkling water"" - sometimes soda water goes by that name.;
, Would you like to make a fruity flavor, or something a little richer? The sky's the limit when it comes to making your own soda. Choose one of these delicious flavors, or make up your own:


Lemon lime. This classic flavor combination is refreshing, and even more so when you create it yourself using fresh limes and lemons.
Vanilla cream. Another soda counter favorite, this smooth, rich soda is delicious any time of year. You'll need whipping cream and vanilla extract.
Chocolate. Chocolate soda is surprisingly easy to make - all you need is some chocolate syrup, and you're good to go.
Tropical punch. Buy some mangoes, pineapples, and kiwis, or skip the whole fruit and just buy a variety of juices to make your tropical soda.

, The great thing about making your own soda is that you get to choose how sweet to make it. You can stick with plain sugar or go with a different flavor like honey, agave nectar, or even molasses. Choose a sweetener that matches the soda flavor you designed.


Soda made with fruit won't need as much sweetener as other types of soda, since the fruit itself provides a lot of the sweetness.
Pair vanilla and chocolate sodas with maple syrup for an interesting twist.
Make diet soda by using a sugar substitute.

, Pour the carbonated water into a large pitcher or punch bowl. Add the flavor you chose, whether it's freshly squeezed fruit, chocolate syrup, or cream and vanilla. Mix in some sweetener, then stir the entire concoction with a large spoon. Serve immediately or store in a capped bottle for later use.


Taste the soda as you add flavorings and sweetener to determine how much more you want to add.
Serve the drink in clear glasses with straws to show off its pretty colors and the sparkling bubbles. Homemade soft drinks make a great party treat.

Pick your vegetables.,
Prepare your vegetables.,
Devise some equipment.",How to Steam Vegetables1," Though technically all vegetables can be steamed (what can't be?), certain vegetables steam better than others do, and all steam at different rates. Broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, asparagus, artichokes, and green beans will all turn out nicely and are standard steaming fare. But if you want to get creative, throw in some potatoes or radishes, too! Here's a brief rundown on steaming times:


Asparagus: 5 to 8 minutes
Broccoli: stalks for 7 minutes, florets for 5
Carrots: 10 to 15 minutes, depending on size
Cauliflower: stalks for 7 minutes, florets for 5 (whole head 15-25 minutes)
Corn on the cob: 8 to 10 minutes
Green beans: 4 to 6 minutes
Potatoes, cubed: 10 to 15 minutes
Spinach: 2 to 3 minutes
;
, While certain greens are easy to just get out of the fridge, give a quick rinse-down, and toss in the pan, some need preparing. You would not put an entire pumpkin in a steamer, would you?


Carrots take much less time the smaller they are cut up; the same goes for cauliflower and potatoes. Use your logic when it comes to certain vegetables like asparagus, where the tips should be cut off beforehand. The vegetables need to be in their ready-to-eat form on steaming.


, If you have a legitimate steamer, great! Throw some water in that bad boy and stop reading this page. However, if you don't, you have several methods/devices/tricks of the trade at your disposal:


A steamer is a pot of water with a bowl/basket/container on top with holes in the bottom. If you have a colander that is heat resistant or some pan that fits this description that does not touch the bottom of the pot with water (otherwise that is just boiling), that can be used as a steamer. You will need a lid to put on it, too.
Use the microwave. All you need for this is a microwave-safe dish and some plastic wrap.
You can improvise the steaming method by just using a pan with a matching lid. All you do is add a bit of water to the vegetables and count on the steam to do most of the job. Some nutrients will seep into the water, though, yes, so this method isn't ideal.

Bust out your steamer.,
Add the vegetables.,
After a minute and a half, prick all the vegetables with a knife to test them.,
Remove just the green vegetables.,
Season and serve.",How to Steam Vegetables2," Begin by bringing 2 cups (16 oz) of water to a boil over a high heat. Once the water begins to boil, close the steamer to allow its internal temperature to build.


""Closing the steamer"" here meaning put the lid on the top pan, which is resting on the pan filled with water. This is similar to a double boiler or bain marie. 


, After the steamer has been covered for a minute, add your chosen vegetables, prepared and ready to go. Make sure to keep them in separate groups; this will make them easier to remove when they finish, as each one cooks at a different time.


, The green ones should be closer to done than the others. If they seem ready, which they should just about be, the steaming is done!


, If you are working with cauliflower, carrots, potatoes, or corn, you may need more time. Whenever your vegetables are done, place them onto a tray lined with paper towels to drain.


Of course, the best test is a taste test. Your vegetables should be firm, but tender. 


, Transfer all your steamed vegetables onto a serving platter. Season to taste with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Your vegetables are now ready to serve.


They go wonderfully with any meat, can be served with a cheese or herb sauce, or even just as they are. Since steaming is so healthy, it is best not to load them up with extra fixings -- they are delicious and nutritious as is!

Add the vegetables when the water is boiling.,
Remove from the heat and serve.",How to Steam Vegetables3," It needs to be big enough for all your vegetables. Make sure it also has a matching lid or a lid that will sufficiently keep in the steam.

, This will create the steaming effect but is not enough to boil all the nutrients out of the vegetables. And the left over water can be used in a vegetable broth!Don't be tempted to add more water -- that defeats the purpose. If it all evaporates away mid-steam (which it shouldn't), you can just add more.

, Refer to the heating times listed above to know when the vegetables are done. Keep the vegetables separate so you can easily take out the ones that finish first.


If the lid has a vent, great. You want a tiny amount steam to escape. If it doesn't, open it just slightly periodically -- but not all the way!

, Steamed vegetables without a steamer. Season as you like (salt, pepper, or olive oil) and serve with any main dish.

Eat.",How to Steam Vegetables4," This does not seem like much, but it will do the job. Microwaves work quickly, giving the water little time to evaporate.


If you're working with denser, non-green vegetables, a bit more water may be needed, yes, depending on how large they are.

, Harken back to the days of TV dinners and recall the technology of the upturned corner. It is the same thing. And no, the plastic wrap won't explode in the microwave.


The other three sides should be tight, sealing in the heat. It just needs the one corner to act as a vent.

, If that does not do it, continue in 1-minute long intervals. Each vegetable is a bit different and so is each microwave -- 5 minutes is a good starting point for checking.


Yes, you are right; zapping them in the microwave is not legitimate steaming as the microwave does cook them some, too. Some of the nutrients will be lost -- but some won't.The microwave method is more about convenience and speed than anything else.

, Remove the plastic wrap, toss it in the trash, and place the vegetables on your dinner plate. Add some seasonings or sauces to taste and enjoy!

Microwave for 3 to 4 minutes.,
Serve warm.",How to Steam Cauliflower," A fresh cauliflower will be pure white and will be wrapped in crisp, bright green leaves.In particular, you should pay close attention to the base of the cauliflower. Regardless of how dirty or dingy the top looks, the base should be as white as possible. The color of the base is the best indication of how fresh the vegetable is.






The floret tops along the outside of the head should be fairly compact. If they are loose, or if there are wide gaps between the tops, this could be an indication that the cauliflower has already started to go bad.





;
, Use a sharp knife to cut off the green leaves surrounding the head of cauliflower. Cut the leaves off as close to the base of the stem as possible.


Note that the leaves can be cooked, too, as long as they are fresh. They are especially useful for vegetable stock, but they could be cooked down and used in stews, roasted, or eaten raw in salads.







, To make removing florets easier, cut off the large stem just before the point at which it divides into individual florets.


The stem could also be saved and used for vegetable stock.
Technically, this step is only optional. You can remove individual florets from the cauliflower without first removing the excess stem, but doing so will be much more difficult.

, Turn the head upside down so that the cut stem end faces up. Use your sharp kitchen knife to cut each individual branch or floret off.


Slice the floret off at the point where the floret stem meets the central stem. Cut them from the central stem at a 45 degree angle.
Take the time to trim away and discolored parts of the cauliflower. Brown or otherwise off-color cauliflower will not taste as good and will lack many of the nutrients that fresh cauliflower has.
Note that small baby cauliflowers can be cooked whole. You do not need to cut them into individual florets.

, You can use the florets as they are now, but if they are still somewhat large, they might take longer to cook. Use your knife to trim the florets down into smaller pieces. They should be about the same size as you would expect frozen florets to be.


Cooking cauliflower for a shorter amount of time means preserving more of its nutrients.

, Place the cauliflower florets in a colander and rinse them under cool, running water. Pat dry with clean paper towels when done.


Dirt and debris can get caught in between the floret clusters and stems. If you spot any dirt, gently scrub it away with your fingers. Your fingers should usually be sufficient; a vegetable brush should not be needed.

, Fill the stockpot with roughly 2 inches (5 cm) of water and boil it on the stove over high heat.

, Make sure that the steamer basket does not dip into the boiling water.


If you do not have an actual steamer basket, you could use a metal or wire mesh colander instead. Just make sure that the colander fits over the mouth of the stockpot without tipping into it., Carefully dump the florets into the steamer basket, spreading them out into an even layer.


The florets should be arranged upright, with the clustered tops facing up and the stems facing down.
If possible, arrange the florets in a single layer. If this is not possible, though, you should at least make sure that the florets are distributed in the basket as evenly as possible.

, Cover the stockpot and let the gathering steam cook the cauliflower. When done, the florets should be tender enough to pierce with a fork but should not be mushy.


The stockpot and steamer basket must be covered. Placing the lid on the stockpot traps the steam inside, and the steam is what you need in order to cook the cauliflower florets with this method.
For standard-size florets, check the cauliflower after the first 5 minutes. If they still seem too tough, cover the pot again and continue cooking. Usually, it will take 7 to 10 minutes for the cauliflower to cook through.
Large florets can take up to 13 minutes.
If you decide to steam the entire head of cauliflower at once, it could take 20 minutes or longer to do so.

, Remove cooked cauliflower from the steamer basket and place in a serving dish. Season with salt, pepper, and butter, as desired.


There are other ways you can serve steamed cauliflower, as well. You could drizzle soy sauce over it, sprinkle the florets with Parmesan cheese, or season the cooked florets with spices and herbs like paprika, lemon pepper, or parsley. Precisely how you enjoy this healthy treat it up to you, so get creative.

, Spread the florets out into as even a layer as possible.


If possible, arrange the florets in a single layer. If this is not possible, though, you should at least make sure that the florets are distributed in the dish as evenly as possible.

, For a standard head of cauliflower, add about 2 to 3 Tbsp (30 to 45 ml) of water.


There should only be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water in the bottom of the container.The idea is to have enough water to create steam, but not so much water that you end up boiling the cauliflower florets, instead.

, If the dish you use has a microwave-safe lid, cover it with that. Otherwise, cover the dish with a layer of microwavable plastic wrap.


If your container does not have a microwave-safe lid and you either do not have plastic wrap or are uneasy about putting it in the microwave, you can cover the bowl with a microwavable ceramic or stoneware plate. Make sure that the plate covers the mouth of the dish completely.Covering the dish is essential because it allows you to trap steam. The steam created by the heated water is what will cook the cauliflower florets in this method.

, Steam the cauliflower in the microwave on high power. When done, the florets should be tender enough to pierce with a fork but should not be mushy.


Check the cauliflower florets after the first 2 1/2 minutes. Recover it and continue cooking, if needed, for up to an additional 1 1/2 minutes.
Exercise caution when you remove the lid. Open the lid away from your face so that the steam does not burn you as it escapes.

, Remove cooked cauliflower from the microwavable dish and transfer it to a serving dish. Season the florets with salt, pepper, and melted butter, as desired.


There are other ways you can serve steamed cauliflower, as well. You could drizzle soy sauce over it, sprinkle the florets with Parmesan cheese, or season the cooked florets with spices and herbs like paprika, lemon pepper, or parsley.

Start by making a thick soda-syrup base.,
Bring the mixture to a boil in a heavy saucepan.,
Reduce the syrup by half.,
Store in squeeze bottle and refrigerate.,
Serve by mixing with ice and seltzer water.",How to Make Soda1," The easiest and fastest way to make your own soda is to create a thick flavoring and add a small amount to already-carbonated soda water. If you want to start from scratch, skip to the next method and brew your own. Making syrup saves you the trouble of messing with yeast, and works in much the same way an old-fashioned soda jerk used to work, or a modern soda machine.In a saucepan, mix the following ingredients:


1 cup granulated sugar
about 1/2 cup water
1/2 cup fresh fruit juice, or two tablespoons of flavor extract;
, Whisk vigorously to keep the sugar moving, staying careful to avoid burning it. It should melt thoroughly and form a thick syrup. Bring the syrup to a boil.

, Turn down the heat and let simmer until half of mixture is left. It'll look pretty thick and sweet, which is good. It should be very sweet and concentrated, perfect for cutting in cold soda water.

, Let the syrup cool and store it in an easy-access container in the refrigerator. It should be good for a few weeks, or more.


If you've got a sports water bottle, that would be perfect for storing. You can portion out a squirt or two of the syrup per glass of soda you want to make, and keep it nicely slotted in the fridge door.

, Fill a glass with soda water and add a small squirt of the soda syrup to it, mixing it thoroughly with a spoon until it becomes integrated. Give it a taste and add more if necessary, or dilute it further with more soda water. Serve chilled and enjoy.


If you've got access to a carbonator, you can even bubble up your own soda water to streamline the process and make everything yourself. While a carbonator can cost a pretty penny, you'll be able to start making your own soda water for free. If you drink lots of it, it'll pay for itself in no time.

Thaw the crab legs.,
Bring 4 cups (1 L) of water to a boil in a large stockpot.,
Place the crab legs inside the steamer basket.,
Steam until heated through.,
Serve hot.",How to Steam Crab Legs1," The best way to thaw frozen crab legs is by placing them in the refrigerator overnight.









Place the crab legs and claws in a container as they thaw so that they will not drip water inside the refrigerator as the ice melts.
If you do not have enough time to thaw the crab legs in the refrigerator, you can thaw them by rinsing them under cold, running water for a few minutes. At the very, make sure that the ice has melted before cooking them.;
, Insert a steamer basket inside the pot, making sure that the bottom of the basket does not come into direct contact with the water.









You only need about 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) of water in the stockpot. The water level should be low enough to avoid hitting the bottom of the steamer basket.
If you do not have a steamer basket, a metal colander can be used, instead. Just make sure that the colander can rest on the lip of the stockpot without falling into it and that the lid of the pot can still fit on top. Additionally, the colander should never dip into the water inside the stockpot.

, Arrange the crab legs and claws in a single layer and cover the stockpot.









By keeping the crab legs and claws in a single layer, you ensure even cooking. If they need to be stacked slightly, however, they should still cook through.
A tight cover is essential. If you do not cover the stockpot, you will have no way of trapping the steam inside, and the crab legs will not heat through correctly.

, This can take anywhere from 5 to 7 minutes depending on the size of the crab legs and how thawed they are before you steam them.









Once the crab legs become fragrant, they are likely done or very close to being done.If you want to check more thoroughly, carefully pick one up with tongs and touch the meaty part with the tip of your pinky finger.

, Steamed crab legs should be enjoyed immediately. They are often served with clarified butter, but melted butter, salt, and lemon wedges are also good accompaniments.









Be careful when removing the crab legs from the steamer. Lift the lid away from your face so that you do not accidentally burn yourself on the hot steam as it bursts out.
Steamed crab legs and claws have softened shells, so a crab cracker should not be used to get the meat out. Instead, use sharp kitchen scissors or shears to cut the crab apart at down the center.
If serving these to guests, you can completely remove the shell or simply cut a small slit into each one to get the process started.In case you find the crab legs or claws too hot to handle with your bare hands, or if the shell is spiny and hard to hold, you could wear a glove while working with it.

Assemble the necessary ingredients and equipment.,
Sterilize and wash your bottles.,
Cook up the flavored syrup.,
Add the yeast.,
Pour soda into the bottles.,
Take your first taste outdoors.",How to Make Soda2," Brewing your own soda is a whole lot easier than you might think. All you need is some sugar, bottles, flavoring, and a little time. To get started on your own batch, you'll need:



Enough bottles to hold roughly a gallon of liquid. Old recycled plastic soda bottles work fine, as long as you clean them properly. Many soda-makers prefer the plastic bottles because they have less of a chance of breaking while the soda bubbles. Glass bottles, on the other hand, are more environmentally friendly and will last longer. Flip-cap glass beer bottles work great for making soda, as long as you keep an eye on them while they carbonate.

Sweetener. Using regular white sugar is fine, though alternative sweeteners like honey or agave nectar are also effective if you want to cut refined sugar from the equation. You'll need about a half-cup to a cup of sugar or the equivalent in alternative sweetener, depending on how sweet you want your soda.

Yeast. Commercial yeasts like champagne yeast are commonly available at groceries, natural food stores, and beer outlets, and are perfect for getting your soda bubbling. Don't use bread yeast to make soda.

Flavoring. The sky's the limit when it comes to choosing flavors for your homemade soda. Soda extracts and fruit extracts are commonly available at home-brewing stores, in flavors like root beer, ginger, and fruit flavors.It's also just as easy to use whole raw ingredients to cook up your own flavors. Want to learn to make honey-lemon-ginger soda? We've got you covered.

, You'll need to let your cooked-up soda sit and bubble in the bottles for at least 24 hours at room temperature, which means you need to sterilize and wash them before you get started to kill any bacteria that will taint the soda.



If you're using plastic bottles, soak them in a mixture of chlorinated bleach and water--1 tsp. bleach per gallon water--for at least 20 minutes. Wash the bottles thoroughly with dish soap and water to remove any traces of bleach, which will kill the yeast and hurt the carbonation process. If you don't want to use bleach, you can use a natural alternative, like Straight-A, which contains no chlorine.If you're using glass bottles, you can use the same method for plastic bottles, or simply boil them for at least 5-10 minutes to kill bacteria.

, The basic method of brewing soda is to cook up a sugary batch of flavored liquid, then add the activated yeast, and let it sit in bottles to carbonate. The combination of flavors will vary depending on what kind of soda you want to make, but the basic ratio should be about 2 cups of sweetener for every gallon of water you use in the soda, and 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of extract. This will form the uncarbonated base of your soda.



If you're using extracts for flavoring, bring the temperature to hot, but not boiling, about 100 or 110 °F (38 or 43 °C), and dissolve the sugar in the liquid. Add about 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of your flavoring extract and allow the mixture to cool for several minutes until the temperature comes down.

If you're using raw ingredients for flavoring, bring a gallon of water just to a boil in a large pot and add the sugar, stirring vigorously to dissolve it. Let it cook for a few minutes, stirring continuously, so the flavors infuse, then remove it from the heat and add the yeast.

, You've got a basic flavored drink, but now you've got to add the bubbles. When the sugary liquid has come down to around 100 °F (38 °C)--it needs to be warm enough to activate the yeast, but not so warm as to kill it--add about a 1/4 teaspoon of champagne yeast to the mixture and stir vigorously to activate.


Yeast, depending on the age and the potency and the climate, can be a tricky thing. When you're first starting out, you may end up with soda that's too carbonated, or soda that's too flat, depending on how much you use. Anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon can be an appropriate amount. It's best to err on the side of not-carbonated-enough, though, since you can add bubbles after the fact.
Overcarbonated soda can cause bottles to explode, which can be messy at best and dangerous at worst, especially if you're using glass bottles. For your first batch, aim for the low end of carbonated and experiment to see what works best for you.

, Use a sanitized funnel to pour soda directly into your sanitized bottles after adding the yeast, and cap them. Allow the bottles to sit on the counter at room temperature for at least 24 hours to carbonate fully, then put them immediately into the refrigerator.If you cooked up soda with raw ingredients, it might be appropriate to run the soda through a strainer to get out any sediment or hard bits that might be left at the bottom of the pot.
If the bottles get too warm after being filled and capped, they may pop their tops or burst. As soon as they're done bubbling at room temperature, put them in the fridge to keep them safe.

, After letting the soda sit for 24 hours, take a bottle outside and open it. It might fizz up uncontrollably, letting you avoid a nasty mess if you're in the yard instead of the kitchen. If you're satisfied with the carbonation and the taste, put the bottles in the fridge and enjoy them over the next week or so. After five days in the fridge, they'll tend to lose some of their carbonation and become flat.


If the soda isn't as bubbly as you'd like it, you can let them sit on the counter for another day or two to hopefully increase the carbonation. If that doesn't work, you can also add another tiny pinch of carbonation to each bottle, if you want, to try again. Or just enjoy the sodas slightly flat and cook up another batch!

Try out an old-fashioned root beer.,
Make fruit soda from fruit juices or extracts.,
Try cracking the Coke-code.,
Brew up some sweet ginger ale.",How to Make Soda3," Because sarsaparilla bark was outlawed by the FDA a long time ago, commercial root beer is made with root beer extract. It's commonly available in homebrew stores for $3-$5, enough to make several batches of your own homemade root beer. The materials pay for themselves in the long run. Zatarain's is a common and cheap brand that's widely available, but experiment with different varieties to find one you like best.


Add two tablespoons of root beer extract after boiling the sweetener and water, before adding the yeast. Try using brown sugar instead of white for an added molasses kick to the finished product.
Try out other roots for unusual earthy-botanical sodas. Licorice root extract is also available that tastes delicious and surprising, especially when mixed with a little lemon rind.

, Orange, grape, lemon-lime, strawberry, even lemon-papaya: fruit sodas are where it's at. Adding a few tablespoons of any fruit extracts you can find will give you a great fruity summertime soda.


Instead of using extract, start your soda base with grape juice instead of water to make authentic grape soda. It's a far cry from that fake-tasting purple stuff you can get at the store.
If you want to make a citrus-based soda, steep the rinds of oranges, lemons, or limes in the sugar-water mixture for several hours before straining and adding the activated yeast. You'll get the most potent flavor from the rind.
Consider adding a few drops of food coloring if you want the flavor to match the look.

, The flavors that go into Coca-Cola are almost impossible to identify and replicate for a reason--you don't become the number one selling soda for nothing. With the right combinations of food-grade essential oils added to a basic soda mix, though, you can come close to approximating the classic flavor of the most famous cola. Experiment with different combos to get the flavor as close as possible, but start with a combination of equal amounts of the following surprising flavors to get in the neighborhood:


orange
lime
lemon
nutmeg
coriander
lavender

, It's a simple classic, cool, soothing, and refreshing. Making ginger ale from raw ginger and sweetened with honey will beat any commercial soda on the market, perfect for mixing into cocktails or drinking on ice. To make up your own ginger ale:


Mix up a gallon of water, a cup of honey, and the juice of two small lemons in a big pot and bring to a boil. Grate at least two thumb-sized (about 2 inches) pieces of peeled ginger into the pot and let it cool for at least an hour. When the temperature has subsided, you can add the yeast and strain the ginger pieces through a strainer before bottling. Let it sit for at least 48 hours before refrigerating, and let it refrigerate for a few days for the best results."

Thaw the crab legs.,
Add water, lemon wedges, and salt to a large skillet.,
Add the crab legs and cook.,
Serve hot.",How to Steam Crab Legs2," For best results, place the frozen crab legs in a shallow container and thaw them in the refrigerator overnight.









If you do not keep the crab legs in a container as they thaw, the melting ice could leave a big puddle of water in your refrigerator by morning.
Note that crab legs can be thawed with cold water if you are short on time. Run each leg and claw under cold, running water for several minutes. Do not attempt to steam the crab legs until the ice has melted off, at the very least.

, Fill the bottom of the skillet with no more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Add wedges from 1 lemon along with 1 tsp (5 ml) or so of salt. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.









You only need enough water to create steam. If you add too much water, you will end up boiling the crab legs instead of steaming them.
The lemon and salt are only optional.
If you do add the salt, let the contents of the skillet simmer for 2 to 3 minutes, giving the salt ample time to dissolve, before adding the crab legs and/or claws.

, Arrange the crab legs and claws in the skillet in a single layer and cover tightly with a lid. Steam for 5 to 7 minutes, or until heated through.








For a tighter seal, consider covering the skillet with a sheet of aluminum foil as well as or instead of the lid. Place the foil on carefully, however, so that you do not burn your fingertips on the sides of the hot pan.
One good indication that the crab legs are done is when they become notably fragrant.
If you want to double-check on whether or not the crab legs are done, remove the cover of the pan and pick the thickest crab leg up with a set of tongs. Lightly touch the meaty part with the tip of your pinky finger to see if it is warm.

, Enjoy the crab legs as soon as you finish steaming them. Serve them with melted or clarified butter on the side.









Be careful when removing the crab legs from the skillet. Lift the lid away from your face so that you do not accidentally burn yourself on the hot steam as it bursts out.
Steamed crab legs and claws have softened shells, so a crab cracker will likely crush the shell into the meat instead of cracking the shell open. Dig the meat out by using sharp kitchen scissors or shears to cut the crab apart at down the center.
If serving these to guests, you can remove the shell entirely or simply cut a small slit into each one to get the process started. The choice is yours.
If the crab legs too hot to handle with your bare hands, or if the shell is spiny and difficult to hold, wear a glove while working with it.

Wrap three pieces in damp paper towel.,
Wrap each cluster in plastic wrap.,
Microwave each package for 2 minutes on full power.,
Serve hot.",How to Steam Crab Legs3," Place the crab legs and claws in a shallow container and let them sit in your refrigerator overnight until thawed.









By placing the crab legs and claws in a container, you prevent the ice from melting into water all over your refrigerator shelves.
If you are short on time, thaw the crab legs and claws by rinsing them under cold, running water for several minutes. You can rinse them until the entire section comes to room temperature, but at the very least, you should rinse them until the ice melts off.

, Use sharp kitchen shears or a heavy knife to cut the claws and legs at their joints. Otherwise, you may not be able to fit them into your microwave.









If your microwave is large enough, however, you do not need to separate the claws and legs at their joints.

, Moisten several sheets of clean paper towel with water, wringing them out gently to remove any excess. Securely wrap these damp paper towels around three sections at a time until all the sections are wrapped.









You only need enough water in the paper towels to create steam. As such, damp paper towels, rather than soaking wet paper towels, will be more effective.

, After all the sections are wrapped in paper towels, wrap each one in a couple of layers of microwave-safe plastic wrap.









The plastic wrap helps hold the moisture in, directing the steam from the wet paper towels inward toward the crab legs rather than outward.

, Steam the wrapped clusters of crab legs and claws in the microwave one at a time.








The crab legs should become notably fragrant once they are done. If you cannot smell them yet, microwave the wrapped clusters for another 30 seconds or so.
To verify that the crab legs and claws have heated through, unwrap one set and lightly touch the meaty part with the tip of your pinky finger to see if it is warm.

, Remove each cluster and carefully unwrap them. Serve immediately with a side of melted or clarified butter. Add salt and lemon wedges, if desired.









Be careful when removing the plastic wrap and paper towels. The crab legs and claws will be steamy, and you could accidentally burn yourself on the steam if you stick your face directly into it.
Steamed crab legs and claws have softened shells. As such, a crab cracker should not be used to get the meat out, since it will only smash the shell into the meat instead of cracking it apart cleanly. Instead, use sharp kitchen scissors or shears to cut the crab apart at down the center.
When serving these to guests, you can either completely remove the shell or cut a small slit into each one to get the process started.
If the crab legs or claws too hot to handle with your bare hands, or if the shell is spiny and prickly, you could wear a glove while working with it to protect your hands.

Place the cabbage in a microwave-safe dish.,
Add 2 to 3 Tbsp (30 to 45 ml) water.,
Cover loosely.,
Microwave until tender-crisp.,
Serve hot.",How to Steam Cabbage," Regardless of the specific variety, fresh cabbage has crisp leaves without any marks or signs of browning. There should not be many loose outer leaves, and the stem should not look dry or cracked.


Green cabbage should have dark green outer leaves and pale green inner leaves. The head of cabbage should be round.
Red cabbage should have tough outer leaves and a reddish purple color. The head of cabbage should be round.
Savoy cabbage has crinkled leaves and consists of fairly loose leaves that range in color from dark to light green. The head of cabbage should be round.
Napa cabbage is tall, rather than round, and generally has pale green leaves.
Bok choy has tall white stalks with dark green leaves.;
, These leaves should be loose enough to peel away with your hands.


Damaged leaves include any that are discolored or wilted. For round heads of cabbage, like green cabbage, red cabbage, and savoy cabbage, you should also remove the thickest outer leaves.

, Hold the cabbage still with one hand. Pick up a large, sharp knife in your other hand and cut the cabbage in half through the stem end. If desired, cut the cabbage further into quarters by cutting each half in half again lengthwise.


Cabbage will take longer to cook if left in halves, but otherwise, it is just as easy to prepare as quartered cabbage.






If you see any signs of insects or worms inside the cabbage, you do not need to toss the whole thing out. Instead, soak the head of cabbage in heavily salted water for 20 minutes. Cut away the damaged portions and prepare as normal.







, Cut wedge-shaped sections from the bottom of each half or quarter to remove the rough stem pieces.


The stems will need to be cut out at an angle.






Note that for cabbage with long, loose leaves, such as napa cabbage and bok choy, the leaves should be left intact and on the stem.







, If you want to shred the cabbage before steaming it, slice each quarter into thin pieces and separate the layers by hand.


Alternatively, you could shred the cabbage by sliding quartered heads across a sharp mandoline.






If shredding napa cabbage or bok choy, slice the cabbage crosswise rather than lengthwise and separate the layers.







, Place the cabbage in a colander and rinse it under cool, running water.


Place the colander over clean paper towels and let it drain for a couple of minutes before continuing.







, Meanwhile, fit a steamer basket into the stockpot, noting that the bottom of the basket should not come into contact with the water.


The stockpot should only be about 1/4 full with water, if not less.






After placing the stockpot on your stove, heat it over high heat to get a rapid boil going.






You could add salt to the water, if desired, which will add subtle flavor to the cabbage as it cooks. Do not do this if you plan on salting the cabbage directly, though.






The bottom of the steamer basket should never come into direct contact with the boiling water. If the boiling water reaches through the bottom of the basket, you may end up boiling the bottom part of the cabbage instead of steaming it.






If you do not have a steamer basket, you could use a metal or wire mesh colander, instead. Just make sure that the colander can rest on the lip of the stockpot without falling in and without preventing the lid from fitting over it.

, Spread the cabbage out in an even layer.


If steaming shredded cabbage, you will need to make sure that the cabbage is evenly distributed throughout the bottom of the steamer basket.






If steaming quarters or halves, arrange the pieces so that they are touching and facing stem-side down. Each piece should be equally exposed to the bottom of the basket.







, Sprinkle the leaves with salt and pepper, if desired, to add flavor to the cabbage as it cooks.


Use about 1 tsp (5 ml) of salt and 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of ground black pepper, or add more or less of the seasonings to match your own tastes.
At this stage, you should not add any oil or dressings to the cabbage. Only dry seasonings, like salt and pepper, should be added.

, The exact amount of time the cabbage needs to be steamed for will vary on the type and on how fine the cabbage was cut before you placed it in the basket.


To promote even cooking, you may flip the wedges or halves over halfway through the cooking time.Other than that, however, you should not lift the lid of the pot. Doing so will release the steam needed to cook the cabbage.






In general, cook shredded cabbage for 5 to 8 minutes.Napa cabbage, savoy cabbage, and bok choy, however, may cook in only 3 to 5 minutes.






In general, quarters should be cooked for 10 to 12 minutes. Tall cabbages like napa cabbage and bok choy tend to finish on the shorter end. Savoy cabbage can cook in as few as 5 minutes and as many as 10 minutes. Red cabbage may take a few minutes longer than other varieties.






Add an additional 1 or 2 minutes onto the quartered cooking time when you are steaming cabbage halves.







, Remove the steamer basket from the stockpot and let it drain on clean paper towels for a few minutes before serving.


If desired, you could sprinkle the cabbage with additional salt and pepper or drizzle melted butter or olive oil over it. Toss well yet gently to coat.






For a stronger flavor, drizzle 2 to 3 Tbsp (30 to 45 ml) of apple cider vinegar over the cabbage and toss to coat.This works especially well with napa cabbage and red cabbage.







, Arrange the cabbage so that it is in even layers inside the dish.


If steaming shredded cabbage, make sure that the cabbage is evenly distributed throughout the bottom of the dish. It does not need to be in a single flat layer, but the layers of cabbage should be even to promote even cooking.






Note that shredded cabbage is not recommended for microwave steaming since the bottom layer will ultimately be boiled instead of steamed.






If steaming quarters or halves, arrange the pieces so that they are touching and facing stem-side down. Do not stack or layer the wedges.







, The water level at the bottom of the dish should be kept very low.


If cooking shredded cabbage, use roughly 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water for every 2 cups (500 ml) of shredded cabbage. The increased water may half-boil and half-steam, but if you do not increase the amount of water, the cabbage is not likely to cook evenly.
For a boost of flavor, you could use broth instead of water. Vegetable broth is the best option, but a mild chicken broth can work just as well.

, If the dish has a microwave-safe lid, use that. If not, use microwavable plastic wrap.


Do not cover tightly. If the dish has a lid you can use, place the lid on slightly askew to prevent too much pressure from building up or open any vent valves.
Do not pierce the plastic wrap. Instead, simply drape the plastic wrap over so that it clings to the top of the dish but not around the sides.
If you do not have a lid or plastic wrap, you could cover the dish by placing an upside-down microwave-safe plate over the top of it.

, The exact amount of time will vary based on the wattage of your microwave, how large the pieces of cabbage are, and what type of cabbage you are using.


For wedges, microwave on high for 5 to 6 minutes. If steaming bok choy, however, drop this amount of time to 4 to 5 minutes.
For shredded cabbage, microwave on high for 5 minutes. Pause at the halfway mark, quickly stir it with a fork or spoon, and continue cooking.

, Let the cabbage drain in a colander or on clean paper towels and serve while still warm.


If desired, sprinkle the steamed cabbage with salt and pepper or drizzle melted butter or olive oil over it. Toss well yet gently to coat.
For a stronger flavor, drizzle 2 to 3 Tbsp (30 to 45 ml) of apple cider vinegar over the cabbage and toss to coat. This works especially well with napa cabbage and red cabbage.

Prep your vegetables.,
Put the vegetables in a microwave-safe bowl.,
Lightly season.,
Microwave on high!",How to Cook Vegetables in the Microwave," Of course, this will mean different things depending on the item. Generally speaking, small, even chunks is the way to go.


It is generally a good idea to cook vegetables separately so that nothing is over- or under-cooked. However, if you must mix them up, cut the vegetable that requires more cooking into smaller chunks. For example, if cooking potatoes and cauliflower together, make sure that the potato chunks are much smaller than the cauliflower florets.
In the case of corn on the cob, keep the husk on. Because corn is a grain, the loss of water results in starchier, firmer corn. The husk helps prevent this loss of moisture.





;
, For safety reasons, bowls that do not heat up in the microwave are preferable (such as Pyrex glass bowls). However, any microwave-safe bowl used carefully with oven mitts should do the trick.

, Microwave cooking results in a texture much like steamed vegetables (which makes sense; microwave radiation excites water molecules in food, which increases temperature and results in water converting to steam). Heavy seasoning is rarely necessary because the vegetable retains much of its original flavor. A little bit of salt and pepper is sufficient; a pinch of spices or herbs will be more than enough.

, Add about 3 tablespoons of water to the bowl for every pound of vegetable. Generally, firmer vegetables such as beets or turnips will take longer to cook, whereas softer, moister vegetables such as broccoli take much less. Leafy greens such as spinach take very little time at all. Cook for approximately ½-2/3 the recommended time, then check each minute after with a wooden skewer.


For reference, potato chunks generally take about 8 minutes, broccoli florets about 4 minutes, and spinach about 3 minutes per pound.






Understandably, larger chunks also take more time to cook that smaller bits. Take this into account.






Consult this chart for more specific cooking times.

Frozen asparagus can be steamed, although the texture won't be as firm as steamed fresh asparagus.;
, Run it under cool water. Use your fingers to remove any soil.

, The tough, woody part at the base of the asparagus stem is not as tasty and tender as the top part. Snap it off with your hands or use a knife to chop it off.


If you wish, cut the asparagus into bite-sized pieces before steaming.






Thick asparagus can be peeled. If the skin seems a little tough, use a potato peeler to remove it.

, Squeeze out excess water so the towels are moist, but not dripping wet.

, Grab a good bunch of asparagus and wrap it completely in a towel. Repeat until all the asparagus has been bundled and wrapped.


Alternatively, place inside a microwave steamer bag available from the supermarket.

, Microwave on high for 3 minutes.

Pull off the outer petals.,
Dip the petals in butter, condiments, or prepared sauce.,
Eat the soft portion of the leaf.,
Scrape out the inedible inner fibers.,
Remove and eat the heart.",How to Steam Artichokes," A fresh artichoke will be quite heavy and deep green.


The artichoke should also have tight leaves that make a squeaking sound when squeezed together. The leaves should not look dry or split apart.Smaller artichokes tend to be more tender, but large artichokes have larger hearts, and the hearts are generally the sweetest, most flavorful part of the vegetable.;
, Rinse well under cool, running water and pat dry with clean paper towels.


Artichokes tend to hold a considerable amount of dirt and debris inside the tips of the leaves, so you should gently scrub the artichoke with your fingers as you rinse it to dislodge most of the dirt.
You can also let the artichoke soak briefly in a bowl of cool water for a few minutes before rinsing it, but this is not strictly necessary. Rinsing is usually a sufficient way to clean an artichoke.
Do not wash artichokes before storing them since doing so could cause them to spoil faster. Wait until immediately before you plan to steam the vegetable.

, Use a sharp knife to cut off all but 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the stem.


You could cut the stem off completely if you plant to serve the artichokes upright.
Artichoke stems are edible, but they tend to be bitter, so many people prefer not to eat them.

, Use your fingers to strip the bottom leaves from the artichoke.


You should be able to remove them with your fingers, but if you have a hard time, cut the leaves away with a knife or scissors.
You only need to remove the small, fibrous leaves from the very bottom of the artichoke. You do not need to remove the outer leaves along the side.

, Hold the artichoke on its side with one hand and use your other hand to cut off 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the pointed top with a sharp knife.


This step is not strictly necessary, but removing the tip can make the artichokes safer and easier to eat.

, Use sharp kitchen scissors to snip off the prickly tips from the remaining outer leaves along the sides.


The leaves themselves are good to eat, but these prickly portions can scrape your mouth and taste unpleasant.

, Rub one-half of a cut lemon over all the cut edges of each artichoke.


Artichokes are prone to oxidation and browning once cut. Acids, like lemon juice, slow the oxidation process long enough for you to cook and serve the artichoke.

, Fill the stockpot with 2 inches (5 cm) or so of water and bring it to a boil on your stove top over high heat.


The stockpot you use should be large enough to fit a steamer basket.
As you fill your stockpot with water, keep in mind the water level should fall just below the bottom of your steamer basket once the basket is placed inside the stockpot.

, Squeeze both halves of the lemon into the boiling water and sprinkle the salt into the water, as well. Let boil for a couple of minutes.


After adding your lemon juice and salt, rest the steamer basket inside the stockpot. If necessary, add more water to bring the water level to a point just below the steamer basket.
The lemon juice and salt will both add flavor to the artichokes. Moreover, the additional lemon juice in the water will further help prevent oxidation.

, Situate the artichokes in the steamer basket stem-side-down and keep them in a single layer.


The artichokes must be in a single layer to cook evenly.
Cover the stockpot after placing the artichokes inside and reduce the heat to medium-high or medium. The water should still be boiling, but it should not boil violently or splash up through the bottom of the steamer basket.

,


If the water level drops significantly during the cooking process, you might want to consider adding more water to the pot as it boils. Do not remove the lid too often, however, since doing so will release the steam and increase the overall cooking time.

, Add enough water to cover the bottom 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of the dish. Squeeze the lemon halves into the water and sprinkle with salt. Give the mix a quick stir to combine.


The lemon juice and salt will help flavor the artichokes. In addition, the extra lemon juice will ward away oxidation.

, Dip the stem side of the artichokes in the water first. Then, flip them around so that the top petal side faces down into the water.


By dunking both ends of the artichoke into the water, you can coat more of the vegetable in the lemon and salt water.
Placing the artichokes upside-down as you steam them in the microwave will prevent the leaves from collecting water as you cook them., Tightly cover the dish with microwave-safe plastic wrap, creating a good seal capable of trapping the steam inside the dish.


If you are using a dish with a tight fitting lid, use the lid instead of the plastic wrap. For added precaution, you can use both the plastic wrap and the lid, especially if the lid is fairly loose.
You need to create a tight seal along the top of the dish to trap enough steam to cook the artichokes.

,


The artichokes are done once you can pierce the artichoke hearts with the tip of a paring knife and easily pull the inner leaves out with your fingers or a pair of tongs.

,


Let the artichokes rest just long enough for them to cool. Otherwise, you may burn your fingertips as you try to enjoy them.

, Use your fingers to peel each outer petal off one at a time.


The petals or leaves of the artichoke should peel away without much difficulty. If there is any resistance, the artichoke may not have been cooked long enough.
Peel each petal off by grabbing the tip between your fingers and pulling it down and away from you.

, Melted butter and mayonnaise are two of the most common condiments to serve artichokes with, but the choice of sauce is simply a matter of preference.


For a simple yet zingy twist, mix a dash of balsamic vinegar into a little mayonnaise and use that for a dipping sauce. (balsamic and mayonnaise)
When you dunk each petal into the sauce, dip the white, fleshy end in. This is the end that was closest to the center of the artichoke.

, Grip the other end of the petal and place the dipped side into your mouth. Bite down, slightly, and pull the leaf through your teeth to remove and eat the soft part of the leaf.


After consuming the soft part of the petal, discard the rest of it.
Continue peeling and eating the petals in this manner until all the petals have been stripped from the artichoke.

, Once the leaves have been removed, use a knife or metal spoon to scrape out the fuzzy ""choke,"" or center, of the artichoke.


The artichoke heart is hidden beneath the choke.

, Cut the artichoke heart into pieces using a kitchen knife and dip it into melted butter, mayonnaise, or your preferred sauce. Eat the pieces of heart whole.


This finishes off the artichoke.

Peel and devein the shrimp.,
Boil a small amount of water in a saucepan.,
Place the shrimp on the steamer rack.,
Steam the shrimp until they turn opaque.,
Transfer to ice water if serving chilled.,
Alternatively, serve hot.",How to Steam Shrimp1," The clear shell can be peeled off with your fingers and the dark vein running through the center of the back can be removed with the tip of a sharp knife.If the head and legs are still attached, pull them off with your fingers.






Use your fingers to peel back the outer shell, starting from the head end and working toward the tail. The tail can be removed or kept on for decoration.






Cut down the center of the shrimp's back with a paring knife. Make a shallow cut that is just deep enough to reveal the vein.






Dig the vein out with the tip of your knife.





;
, Fill a large saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water and heat on the stove over high heat. Place a steamer rack inside of the saucepan as the water comes to a boil.

If desired, you could add lemon juice and salt to the water instead of adding it to the shrimp. Doing so will create a more subtle flavor, allowing more of the shrimp's natural taste to come through.






If you do not have a steamer rack or steamer basket, you could use a metal or wire mesh colander, instead.






The water level should be below the bottom of the steamer basket. Do not allow the water to come through the steamer basket. If this happens, you may end up boiling the shrimp instead of steaming it.







, Arrange the shrimp in a single layer on the steamer rack and sprinkle with the salt, pepper, and garlic powder, or any other seasonings you choose.

It is best to keep the shrimp in a single layer, but if you end up having multiple layers, the shrimp should still cook through. They may not cook quite as evenly, but the difference will not usually be very distinguishable.






Since there are gaps in the bottom of the steamer rack, you should not toss the shrimp after adding the seasonings, or else a large portion of the seasonings will be lost as you turn the shrimp over.






If you used salt in the water, you do not need to use salt on the shrimp now.

, The exact amount of time will vary depending on the size of your shrimp. Standard size shrimp will cook in about 3 minutes, covered, once steam starts building inside the pan.You need to place the saucepan lid on the pan as you cook the shrimp. This is the only way steam can build up, and the steam is necessary for cooking the shrimp.






Wait until after steam starts escaping from the lid on the pot before you start timing. This alone can take another few minutes.






Check the shrimp after the first 2 minutes to avoid overcooking it.






When done, shrimp will curl up into the shape of the letter C.






For jumbo or colossal shrimp, add another 2 to 3 minutes.

, If you plan to serve the shrimp cold, immediately remove them from the steamer rack using a slotted spoon and dunk them into a bowl of ice water.


Pour the bowl of ice water and chilled shrimp through a colander to remove the water before serving.

, If you plan on serving the shrimp hot, transfer them from the steamer rack using a slotted spoon and place them in a serving dish.


You should serve the shrimp immediately if you plan on serving them without chilling them. Do not refrigerate and reheat. If you do this, you may end up overcooking the shrimp, and the consistency will turn rubber-like.

Season, if desired.",How to Steam Broccoli Without a Steamer1," Check for insects.;
, Cutting the broccoli into small pieces will help it to cook faster.


If you want to eat the stalks, they should be cut into pieces that are slightly smaller than the florets. Remove any hard, woody pieces.

, Choose a bowl with a lid if at all possible.


A large ceramic bowl or small casserole dish works well.
For one pound of broccoli (about one head) add 2-3 tablespoons of water.
The broccoli does not need to be in a single layer since the steam will rise and affect top layers just as well as it will affect bottom layers.

, Secure the lid onto the bowl, leaving as little room as possible for steam to escape.


If you do not have a lid for your dish, you could also cover the dish with microwave-safe plastic wrap.
A large, heavy, microwave-safe plate can also be placed over the top of the bowl instead of a lid if you would feel more comfortably skipping the plastic wrap.

, Cook the broccoli on High until the broccoli is tender yet still crisp, and is a brilliant emerald green.


Since all microwaves vary by strength, you should check the broccoli after the first 2 minutes. If it is still not done, re-cover the dish and continue microwaving.
If cooked too long, the broccoli will become mushy.

, Remove the lid and season the broccoli with salt and melted butter before serving.


Be careful as you remove the lid. The steam will escape, and it could burn you if you are not careful. Open the bowl away from you to avoid exposing yourself to the steam.

Drizzle with melted butter or olive oil.,
Cover and cook until pink.,
Serve hot.",How to Steam Shrimp2,"


You could line the pan with nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper, if necessary, but cooking spray or shortening is preferable.

, For oven-steaming, shrimp should be left in their shells, so you do not need to peel them. Instead, cut open a small slit in the back of the shell and remove the vein through it.

Use a pair of kitchen scissors to cut into the shell and just barely into the flesh of the skin just above the shrimp's back.






Dig the vein out with the tip of a paring knife.







, Place the shrimp in a colander and rinse lightly under cool, running water. Drain the excess water over the sink.


Place the colander onto a few layers of clean, dry paper towel after draining the majority of the excess water out. Doing this will allow any remaining water to drain, as well, without making a mess on your counter.







, Place the shrimp in your baking pan in a single, even layer.


A single layer is preferable since it promotes the most even cooking, but strictly speaking, it is not completely necessary. Just make sure that the shrimp is in even layers, and avoid creating more than two full layers of shrimp in the pan.

, If desired, also add salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and any other desired shrimp seasonings.


Toss lightly with a spoon or spatula to coat each piece of shrimp evenly and thoroughly.







, Cover loosely with aluminum foil and oven-steam for a total of 7 to 8 minutes, turning once after the 5 minute mark. Note that larger shrimp may take longer to cook.

If working with jumbo or colossal shrimp, steam-cook for another 2 to 4 minutes.
Turn or stir the shrimp with a slotted spoon, spatula, or tongs after the first 5 minutes.
Cover the pan with a loose layer of aluminum foil to trap more of the steam inside., Drain any excess liquid and transfer the shrimp to a serving dish."

Arrange shrimp in a microwave-safe dish.,
Add the water, lemon juice, oil, and seasonings.,
Cover and microwave until the shrimp are pink and opaque.,
Let stand and serve immediately.",How to Steam Shrimp3," Keep the shrimp in a single layer with the tail ends pointing inward.

A 12-inch (30.5 cm) shallow, round, glass casserole dish is recommended, especially if it has a microwave-safe lid. Any dish that can fit the shrimp in a single layer could be used, though.
If you have one, a silicone steamer is actually the ideal choice, but these can be difficult to find. These steamers create a vacuum that allows steam to build from the food's own juices.Avoid using a dish that requires you to stack the shrimp in multiple layers. If this happens, the shrimp may not cook through evenly.

, Drizzle with the liquid ingredients. Lightly sprinkle with salt and pepper or other seasonings, adjusting the amount as desired according to your own tastes.


You should only have a small amount of liquid in the dish, so hold off on any liquid seasonings other than those mentioned here. If you have too much liquid, the shrimp with boil instead of steam.






Gently toss the shrimp with a form to coat each one in the mixture of flavors. When done, though, make sure that the shrimp are returned to their original position with the tail ends pointing inward.







, Cover the dish with microwave-safe safe plastic wrap and cook on high until done. When done, shrimp should also curl up into a C-shape. Note that the exact time will vary based on the size of the shrimp.Miniature and small shrimp will need 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.






Medium or standard shrimp will need 3 to 5 minutes.






Large or jumbo shrimp will need 6 to 8 minutes.
Colossal shrimp will need 8 to 10 minutes.
Check for doneness after the minimum cooking time.
Vent the plastic wrap by poking it once with the tips of a fork.
Alternatively, if the dish has a microwave-safe lid, cover it with that, instead. Make sure to vent the lid by placing it on the dish slightly askew or by opening any built-in vents.
The dish needs to be mostly sealed in order to allow steam to build inside, but do not keep it completely sealed. Doing so could cause too much pressure to build inside.

, Allow the shrimp to stand for 1 to 2 minutes before draining excess liquid from the dish. Serve while still hot.


Miniature to medium shrimp will only need to stand 1 minute, while jumbo and colossal shrimp will need 2 minutes.
Drain the shrimp by pouring out excess liquid or by removing them with a slotted spoon and placing them on a serving dish.
Since the shrimp has not been deveined, you should provide your dinner guests with a paring knife that they can use to fish the vein out of the cooked shrimp as they consume it, if they so desire. No harm will come from eating the vein, however, so this is mostly for the sake of aesthetics and texture.
Alternatively, chill, and serve cold. If you want to serve the shrimp cold, transfer the cooked shrimp to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process immediately. Afterward, place it in the refrigerator for at least 30 to 60 minutes.

Consider using crushed ice or similarly small chunks of ice. They tend to work better and look better than large ice cubes.;
, Pour 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 ml) of flavored beverage syrup into the glass of ice. You can use commercial or homemade syrup.


If you prefer a milder flavor, add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of syrup. For a stronger flavor, use 3 or 4 Tbsp (45 or 60 ml). When in doubt, start with a smaller amount and add more later.
Flavors like vanilla, raspberry, peach, and hazelnut are popular, but you can use any flavored syrup you want. Commercial syrups come in a wide variety of flavors.
You can even combine flavors. For example, mix equal parts raspberry syrup and almond syrup for a raspberry-almond blend.

Combine equal parts banana syrup and Irish cream syrup to create a banana cream pie Italian soda.
Create ""tiger's blood"" Italian soda by combining equal parts strawberry syrup and coconut syrup.



, Add the club soda to the glass, filling it to the top.

, Give the contents of the glass a quick stir with a spoon. Drink the Italian soda immediately, before the ice melts.


Only stir the contents briefly. If you stir the drink too much, it could lose its carbonation.
Taste the Italian soda. If you would prefer a stronger flavor, add a little more syrup and stir it again.
Garnish the drink as desired. You can use slices of fruit, leaves of fresh mint, or whipped cream.

, Use enough ice to fill a 16 oz (500 ml) clear drinking glass halfway.


For best results, use crushed ice or small pebble ice instead of large ice cubes.

, Dump the flavored syrup into the glass, pouring it evenly over the ice already inside.


You can use either commercially prepared beverage syrups or homemade syrups.
When using commercial syrups packaged in a pump bottle, adding two to four pumps of syrup usually provides the right amount of flavor.
If you've made standard Italian soda before, use the same amount of syrup for an Italian cream (French) soda. If you're starting with this drink, then you'll need to experiment a little. Add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) for a milder flavor and up to 4 Tbsp (60 ml) for a stronger, sweeter taste.
Use any syrup flavor you want. For a twist, you can even combine syrup flavors. Add equal parts of both syrups when combining two flavors. Some combinations that work well include: banana and Irish cream, strawberry and coconut, raspberry and almond, and peach and vanilla.

, Add the club soda to the glass. Do not fill the glass completely; leave 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of empty space in between the top of the club soda and the top of the glass.

, Pour the half and half over the contents of the glass. Slowly stir it in until the color of the soda softens throughout the entire glass.


Do not stir the contents of the glass too much since doing so can cause the soda to become flat. Only stir the French soda a few times, just enough to spread the half and half through the top two-thirds to three-quarters of the glass.
For a slightly different variation, add the half and half before adding the club soda. Adding the half and half after the soda is more traditional and allows the half and half to spread gradually, creating a smoother drink. Adding the half and half before adding the soda will create a foamier beverage.
If you don't have half and half, combine equal parts heavy cream and whole milk. Stir the two ingredients together in a separate dish before adding the mixture to the glass.
Use almond milk if you need a dairy-free alternative to half and half.

, Drink the French soda (also known as an Italian cream soda) immediately, before the ice can melt and water down the taste.


Consider garnishing the glass with pieces of fruit or fresh mint. Whipped cream can be added, as well.

, Place the pieces of fruit, sugar, and water in a small saucepan. Set the saucepan on the stove.


A few different fruit options worth considering include: blackberry, strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, mulberry, cherry, pineapple, apple, and mango. Finely chopped rhubarb stalks are another option.
Unless you're using small berries, dice the fruit into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) pieces before adding it to the saucepan.

, Set the stove to medium heat and gradually bring the contents of the saucepan to a simmer, stirring occasionally.

, Place the lid on the saucepan and cook the contents for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sugar completely dissolves and a moderately thick syrup forms.


Note that the color of the syrup should be similar to the color of the fruit at this time. The fruit itself should be significantly softened.

, Pour the contents of the saucepan through a sieve. Collect the syrup and discard the solid chunks of fruit.


To squeeze out as much flavor from the fruit as possible, lightly mash it with the back of a fork or mixing spoon before pouring the contents of the saucepan through the sieve.

, Allow the syrup to cool to room temperature before using it for an Italian or French soda.


For best results, let the syrup cool at room temperature on your kitchen counter. If you need to speed things up, cool it for 30 to 60 minutes in a refrigerator.
Do not add warm syrup to the Italian soda since it will cause the ice to melt too quickly.
Store any excess syrup in the refrigerator.

, Place the two ingredients in a small saucepan and stir them together until the sugar is thoroughly soaked.


Do not add the extract yet.

, Set the saucepan on a stove over medium heat. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the sugar completely dissolves and a clear syrup forms.


Do not cover the pan as the syrup simmers.
Stir the contents of the saucepan occasionally to promote even cooking.

, Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the extract of your choice to the syrup and stir for several minutes to incorporate the flavor.


Do not add the extract while the saucepan is still on the stove. The intense heat can quickly burn away the flavor if you do so.
Use any extract or imitation extract you want to use. Vanilla, coconut, and almond are popular choices, but any option will work. You can even use fruit extracts, like raspberry or lemon.

, Set the syrup aside and let it cool. It should cool to room temperature before you use it in an Italian or French soda.


For best results, cool the syrup at room temperature. You can cool it in your refrigerator if you need to speed the process up, however.
Do not add warm syrup to the Italian or French soda.
Keep any excess syrup in your refrigerator.

Add it to the drink.",How to Make Fake Ginger Ale Using Soda1," Some bartenders use this substitute when there's no ginger ale in stock. It's not intended to be an amazing drink by itself, or to be drunk straight.


Don't assume the customer is fine with the substitute. Let them know you would have to use a soda replacement, and give them the option to change the order.;
, As always, mix in a glass of ice to keep the ingredients cold.

, This adds a spicy aroma and taste to replace the ginger bite. You may use Angostura bitters, or whatever you have on hand.


Bitters are alcoholic. Skip this step if you're making the drink for kids or non-drinkers.

, Most prepackaged sour mixes taste terrible. Make this simple recipe yourself for best results:



Make simple syrup by combining equal amounts of sugar and water. Heat and stir until all sugar is dissolved, then let cool.
To make sour mix, combine two parts simple syrup and three parts lemon or lime juice., At least ¾ of the ""ginger ale"" should be Sprite, 7–Up, or another lemon-lime soda. You can even make it most of the drink, saving just a splash for the remaining ingredients.

, The main purpose of the cola is to add a golden color to the clear soda. You only need a splash, but you can add up to ¼ of the glass if you prefer the taste.

, Test your fake ginger ale by mixing it with whiskey, or use it in cocktails such as the Moscow mule. Bartenders typically add the same amount they would regular ginger ale.

Serve with butter, if desired.",How to Steam Broccoli Without a Steamer2," Use a sharp kitchen knife to separate the florets from the stalks.


The florets should be cut into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces.
The stalks should but cut in half crosswise, and each half should be chopped into slices that are roughly 1/8-inch (3.175-mm) thick.
The stalks are more dense, so they must be cut into smaller pieces than the florets in order to cook them within the same amount of time.

, The pan should be able to hold 2 1/2 to 3 quarts (2 1/2 to 3 liters).. Top the stalks with 1/4 cup (70 ml) water


Do not use much more water than 1/4 cup (70 ml). Adding too much water will only cause the broccoli to boil. You need just enough water to create steam.

, Throw in the broccoli.

, Place a lid on the saucepan and cook the broccoli on the stovetop over high heat until steam forms.


It is crucial that you cover the saucepan securely in order to trap the steam inside.

, Turn the heat down to simmer the broccoli for another 3 minutes.


By turning the heat down, you ensure that the inside of the saucepan will remain hot enough to cook the broccoli but not so hot that it causes the water to boil the broccoli, instead.

, Carefully remove the lid and stir in the butter before serving.


Remove the lid so that the steam points away from your face. Otherwise, you may get burned.
Once finished, the broccoli should be tender-crisp. Mushy broccoli has been cooked too long.

The florets should all be the same size, just as the stalks should all be the same size.
Remove any especially woody bits from the stems.
Smaller pieces will cook faster than larger ones.

, You only need to fill the stockpot with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water.

Make a simple syrup.,
Caramelize the sugar.,
Combine the ingredients.Place all of the ingredients, minus the carbonated water, in the bottom of a drinking glass.,
Add cold soda water.,
Chill and enjoy.",How to Make Dr. Pepper1," The simple syrup should consist of two parts sugar and one part water. Heat the two ingredients together until the sugar is completely dissolved. Note, however, that the amount of simple syrup called for in this recipe is too small to make on its own, so you might need to make more than necessary.


To make simple syrup, begin by boiling 1/4 cup (60 ml) water in a small saucepan set on the stove over high heat.

Once the water is boiling, add 1/2 cup (120 ml) sugar to the pan. Stir well.
Stir the mixture constantly as it continues to boil and cook. When ready, there should be no visible grains of sugar left and the liquid should look clear.


Set aside 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of this simple syrup for your Dr. Pepper recipe. Save the rest in a sealed plastic or glass container stored in the refrigerator.;
, You caramelize sugar by heating it until it melts and turns brown. As with the simple syrup, the quantity called for in this recipe is too small to make on its own, so you might need to make more than required.


To caramelize sugar, begin by sprinkling 1/4 cup (60 ml) white granulated sugar on the bottom of a small, heavy saucepan. Spread the granules out so that they form an even layer.

Place the saucepan on the stove and heat it on medium.
As the sugar begins to brown around the edges, stir it with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula to distribute the heat more evenly. If you do not stir the sugar, some may burn before the rest has a chance to caramelize.
Remove the pan from the heat as soon as the sugar melts and takes on a dark amber color. The caramelized sugar should begin to smoke slightly immediately before you remove it from the heat.


When done, immediately set aside 10 minims (650 mg) of caramelized sugar for use in your drink. You can save the rest, if desired, by transferring it to a non-reactive sealed container and storing it in the refrigerator.

, Stir well with a stirring rod or spoon to mix thoroughly.


Let the caramelized sugar and simple syrup cool to room temperature before you combine the ingredients.
When purchasing citric acid and phosphoric acid, use food grade quality only.
Note that this formula was printed in 1912, back when Dr. Pepper was still used as a pharmaceutical remedy for digestive problems. As such, this recipe will not taste like contemporary Dr. Pepper purchased in the store. If you want to know what the original drink tasted like, however, this recipe will give you a good idea.
The original recipe called for hydrocyanic acid, which is not readily available for commercial purchase. Since this solution tastes like almonds, almond extract has been substituted in its place.

, Slowly pour the water directly over the flavors in the bottom of the glass. The bubbles produced by the carbonation should blend the flavors for the most part, but to ensure that all the flavors get mixed into the drink, slowly mix the contents of the glass with a stirring rod or spoon several times.


Do not stir the drink too rapidly since doing so will release more bubbles and may cause the drink to go flat before you can drink it.
Use cold soda water if possible. If you chill the soda water before you add it to the flavoring ingredients, you should not need to chill the finished drink before drinking it.

, If the drink is already cold enough, you do not need to refrigerate it. Otherwise, refrigerate the drink for 15 minutes or so before enjoying.


Originally, Dr. Pepper did not contain caffeine, which is why this supposedly original recipe does not contain caffeine, either.

Try this for a real ginger taste.,
Start with ginger syrup.,
Fill the glass with seltzer or soda.,
Add a few drops of bitters (optional).,
Stir and serve.",How to Make Fake Ginger Ale Using Soda2," If you want a more authentic ginger flavor, you can rely on this recipe instead. Making it at home allows you to adjust the strength to suit your taste.

, Start with about 2 tbsp (30mL) for a 10-oz (300mL) glass. You can find this ingredient at health food stores, upper end grocery stores, or online. For a fresher taste, make your own:


Heat 1 cup (240mL) water and 1¼ cups (240g) sugar, stirring until dissolved.
Add ½ cup (120mL) grated or thinly sliced, raw ginger.
Simmer for 15 minutes.
Let cool, then add 2 tbsp (30mL) lemon juice.

, Plain seltzer (fizzy water) is best. You may use lemon-lime soda, cream soda, or other sodas. Sodas add a large amount of sugar and can overpower the ginger taste.

, This alcoholic ingredient will add complex herbal flavors. Try it if you happen to have it on hand, but don't bother buying it if you don't make cocktails at home.

, Give it a stir until all the ginger syrup has dissolved. Add ice or drink it straight.

Combine all three ingredients.Open your bottle of cola and pour the almond extract and vanilla extract directly inside.,
Do a taste test.,
Chill and enjoy.",How to Make Dr. Pepper2," Let the mixture rest for a few minutes so that the ingredients can combine on their own.


There is some debate concerning the exact type of cola you need to use for this recipe to turn out right. The majority opinion is that Pepsi-Cola works better than Coca-Cola or any other off-brand cola variety. You can experiment with different types, however, and make that determination for yourself.
Use cold cola. Doing so will prevent you from needing to chill the finished drink before enjoying it.
If you want to drink your beverage from a drinking glass, pour the extracts into the glass first, followed by the cola.

, Sip on the new drink. If you want a sweeter taste or a stronger flavor, add up to an additional 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of both extracts to the drink.


Alternatively, if the sweetness is already too strong, you could water it down by adding another 1/2 cup (125 ml) cola to the drink. Doing so will require you to pour the drink into a separate drinking glass, however.

, If your soda is already cold, you can enjoy it now. If not, close the cap and refrigerate the pop until it feels cold enough to enjoy as usual.

Combine the flavorings in a glass.Pour the cola stevia and cherry flavoring into the bottom of a glass.,
Fill the glass with soda water.,
Chill and enjoy.",How to Make Dr. Pepper3," Mix well with a spoon or stirring rod to blend the flavors.


Note that stevia is a natural sweetener that grows as a plant. Cola stevia is a liquid stevia extract flavored with a generic cola taste.

, Pour 8 oz (250 ml) of cold, carbonated soda water into the glass. The carbonation should begin to combine the flavoring ingredients.


Carbonation alone may not be enough to combine the ingredients evenly, though. To ensure more even flavor distribution, use a stirring rod, spoon, or straw to gently and slowly mix the drink a few times. Work carefully so that you do not cause too many bubbles to form and do not cause the drink to go flat.
Use cold cola water to reduce the likelihood of needing to chill the drink before enjoying it.

, Ideally, the drink should already be cold enough to enjoy. If you want it to be colder, however, refrigerate it for 15 minutes or so before drinking.

Add the cold soda water.,
Steep for 3 hours.,
Strain and serve.",How to Make Dr. Pepper4," Pulse until well-combined.


If you do not have a food processor, use a mortar and pestle to crush the ingredients. A blender may also work.
You may need to break the cinnamon sticks into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces or smaller before adding them to the food processor.
The resulting mixture does not need to be a smooth paste or puree. You only need to crush and combine the ingredients well enough to release their flavors.

, Place the flavoring ingredients in a non-reactive resealable container. Pour the soda water over the ingredients and mix lightly with a spoon or stirring rod to partially combine.


Use cold soda water to reduce the amount of time the concoction will need to chill for.
Keep this mixture in a sealed pitcher or other airtight container. An airtight container will slow the production of bubbles, thereby preventing the drink from going flat. If you use an open container, the drink might go flat before you have a chance to drink it.

, Seal the container and place the concoction in your refrigerator. Let the ingredients seep into the soda water for a minimum of 3 hours.


You could let the ingredients steep for a longer period of time, but understand that the drink will continue to go flat as it sits in the refrigerator. A longer steeping time might produce a stronger flavor but may ultimately result in a less palatable drink.

, Pour the drink through a wire strainer, removing any whole ingredients in the process. Discard the strained solids and save the remaining liquid. This strained liquid is your finished mock Dr. Pepper.

Add up to 5 cups (1.2 liters) of water, and stir.,
Serve the limeade.",How to Make Limeade1," To get the most out of your limes, roll them across the counter while gently pressing down on them with your palm.;
, The pitcher should be large enough to hold at least 6 cups (1.5 liters) of liquid. This will include the lime juice, sugar, and ice.

, Your standard granulated sugar will work just fine, but superfine or castor sugar (not powdered) will work even better because it dissolves easier. Keep in mind that, because you are not cooking the sugar, you may end up with a few un-dissolved grains at the bottom of your pitcher.


Be sure to stir the sugar well to help it dissolve.
For a twist, try ⅔ cup (150 grams) of white sugar and 2 tablespoons (45 grams) of honey instead., Since every one has different tastes, it might be a good idea to add the water 1 cup (240 milliliters) at a time, and tasting the limeade after each cup you add; be sure to stir the limeade well after each addition. You may find that the limeade is just right after only 4 cups (1 liter) of water.


If the limeade is still too sweet or too strong for you, you can add another cup (240 milliliters) of water.

, Avoid adding the ice directly into the pitcher, because the ice will dilute the limeade as it melts. Instead, add the ice into the glasses first, then pour the limeade over the ice.

Serve the punch to waiting guests, or just enjoy it by yourself.",How to Make Sherbet Punch," A cold punch bowl will ensure that your punch stays the right consistency for longer. As for the sherbet, the amount depends on the quantity needed. Figure about 1 large scoop of sherbet per person.


For a glass just for yourself, chill your favorite glass in the freezer. Take it out along with the sherbet, add in a scoop (or two if you're feeling adventurous), and fill with the appropriate juices. Mix it up and you're good to go!;
, If your sherbet was rock hard out of the freezer, it may take a few minutes to combine. The punch should be just about perfect when the sherbet has just started melting.


For lime sherbet punch, add the ginger ale and pineapple juice. Don't have ginger ale? You could use any lemon-lime or citrus-y soda.
For raspberry sherbet punch, add the lemon-lime soda and fruit juice. Raspberry compliments most flavors.
For orange sherbet punch, add the ginger ale, orange juice, and pineapple juice. You could also experiment with mango or pomegranate if you'd like.

, Are your ratios of sherbet to liquid how you like it? Should it be sweeter or tangier? Now is the time to adjust with more sherbet or additional juices. Is it too thick? Too thin? How could it be better?


If the recipe doesn't taste like you imagined, get creative! What other juices or sodas could you throw in the mix to get that zing you're looking for?

, Sherbet punch has a sweet bite that can be quite addictive. You probably won't need to worry about leftovers!


These are best served immediately, in chilled glasses if possible. Add a wedge of lemon, lime, orange, or a raspberry or cherry (heck, all 5 if you'd like!) for additional presentation points!

, Stir everything well with a long-handled spoon until the simple syrup, lime juice, and water are completely combined. You should not see any simple syrup gathered at the bottom of the pitcher.

If it is too strong, then add some more water. If it is too sour, then add some more sugar. Be sure to stir the limeade well after each addition that you make.

, You can garnish it with some lime slices or fresh mint leaves for a fancier touch. It will taste even better with ice, but instead of adding ice straight into the pitcher, consider putting the ice into the glasses instead.

Learn the different types of meat cuts.,
Decide how much meat you want before ordering.,
Be ready for the butcher to ask you questions.,
Ask the butcher any questions that you may have.",How to Buy Meat from a Butcher," In a supermarket, you can simply look at the type of meat on display and pick whatever looks good enough for your purposes. At a butcher shop, you will need to know the name of the cut of meat that you want before you can order it. Most butchers are kind and patient and will help you identify the kind of meats that are most suited for your intended dishes, so don't be afraid to ask when you don't know.


Learning about the different cuts of meat ahead of time can help speed up your visits with the butcher, but it can also give you access to meats not on display because not every type of meat available is put on display at a butcher shop.;
, In a supermarket, meat comes prepackaged in predetermined sizes. At a butcher, you will not only need to know what kind of meat to order, but how much of it you will want.


When buying chops or sausages, you can simply order by the number -- e.g., 3 sausages or 5 pork chops. When buying most other meat cuts, you'll need to order by weight -- e.g., 12 oz. (340 g) of sirloin.
The great thing about buying meat from a butcher is that you can choose how much meat you need to fit your needs. However, for first timers, it can be difficult to know how much meat is enough. As a baseline, you can start off by estimating 4 oz. (113 g) per person. If you end up ordering too little or too much, you can tweak your subsequent orders.

, Other than type of meat and amount of meat, the butcher may ask you questions regarding the meat that you order. If you have no idea how to respond, it is OK to simply say, ""I don't know. What difference does it make?"" Butchers are experts with meat and they should try to help you buy the best meat available to suit your needs.

, If being in a butcher shop arouses a few questions in your mind -- e.g., if you see a slab of meat that looks interesting -- it is never a bad idea to ask. Not only will you increase the knowledge you have about meat, thus improving your future visits to the butcher, but you will also begin to develop a relationship with your butcher. Having a personal butcher that you can trust will have a positive impact on your future meat needs.

If you like your lemonade sour, use ⅔ cup (160 mL) sugar instead.;
, In a jug that can hold at least 2½ quarts (2½ liters), mix the water and sugar mixture into 1½ cups (375 mL) lemon juice and 2 cups (500 mL) cranberry juice or other red fruit juice.


If you like your lemonade sweet, use 1 cup (240 mL) lemon juice instead.
If you do not have red fruit juice, you can replace it with water. The fruit alone will only add a little color, so add a couple drops of red food coloring as well.

, Strawberries can be cut into thin slices or chunks and added directly to the pitcher. If using raspberries, mash them in a separate bowl first to release the juice, then strain it over the lemonade through cheesecloth, muslin, or a fine mesh strainer.


You can skip this if you added red fruit juice, but the fruit will add additional flavor and a fresh appearance.

Start with the best lemons possible.,
Sterilize your equipment.",How to Preserve Lemon Juice1," The fresher the lemons, the fresher your juice will be from the start. Beginning with fresh juice is one of the most essential steps in preserving fresh juice. You can use lemons of virtually any size and variety, but any lemon you juice should be firm, ripe, and unspoiled.;
, The equipment you need will vary depending on the method you use. Glass jars with metal lids are required for canning, while plastic ice cube trays are required for freezing. If using an older technique, glass bottles may be in order. Regardless of the method you use, all equipment and supplies should be sterilized with detergent and hot water. If the supplies are dishwasher safe, you can sanitize them using that method. Otherwise hand-wash the supplies in hot, soapy water and rinse them with boiling or near boiling water.

"
"
Use glass canning jars.,
Fill the jars.,
Put a lid on it.,
Place the jars in your canner and cover with water.,
Boil the water.,
Remove the jars with canning tongs.,
Check the seal.",How to Preserve Lemon Juice2," Only use jars that are approved for canning. Jars that are not specifically designed to work with canning should be avoided since the glass may not be able to withstand the heat. You can use pint (500 ml), quart (1000 ml), or half-gallon (2 liter) jars, but pint (500 ml) jars tend to preserve the juice best. After all, you will be able to go through the juice in a small jar faster than you would a large jar.

, Leave 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) of empty space in between the top of the juice and the rim of the jar. Wipe off any spilled juice.

, Canning jars have a special lid made of a flat lid piece and a ring. Seat the flat lid piece over the mouth of the jar and secure the ring around the lid piece and the mouth of the jar. Screw it on as tightly as possible.

, In the absence of a canner, you may also use a large, heavy stockpot. Either way, the jars should be covered by about 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5 cm) of water.

, Cover the canner or stockpot and boil the water until the pressure can process and seal the jars. The amount of time you should boil the water depends on the size jar you use and the altitude you live at.


For pint and quart (500 and 1000 ml) jars, boil the water for 5 minutes.
For half-gallon (2 liter) jars, boil the water for 10 minutes.
Add an extra 5 minutes onto these times if you live at an altitude between 1000 and 6000 ft (305 m to 1.8 km) or an extra 10 minutes if you live at an altitude above 6000 ft (1.8 km).

, After the jars have rested in the boiling water for an appropriate amount of time, turn off the heat, remove the lid of the pot, and carefully lift the jars out of the hot water using canning tongs. Allow them to cool at room temperature in an area free from drafts. The cooling process should take several hours to overnight.

, Gently press down on the center of the lid. If it ""pops,"" the jar is not properly sealed. If this happens, you should boil the contents of the jar and redo the canning process to create a better seal.

"
Measure the capacity of your ice cube tray.,
Pour fresh-squeezed lemon juice into each compartment.,
Freeze the juice.,
Transfer the cubes into a freezer bag.,
Store the lemon juice in the freezer.",How to Preserve Lemon Juice3," Most trays hold 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of liquid in each compartment, but you should verify this first by measuring out tablespoons (milliliters) of water into the tray's compartments. Knowing how much the tray can hold will allow you to plan out how much lemon juice you can preserve.

, Use a small ladle or small pitcher to make the process easiest. For the sake of consistency, try pouring equal amounts of juice into each compartment in the ice cube tray.

, Place the ice cube tray or trays into the freezer for an hour or two, until the juice has completely frozen. Frozen juice is of a softer texture than frozen water, so the cubes will not be as hard as standard ice.

, Remove the cubes of lemon juice from the ice cube tray and transfer them into a resealable plastic freezer bag.

, Seal the bags and store them in the freezer. Lemon juice can be preserved this way for several months.

Add cream of tartar to fresh-squeezed lemon juice.,
Allow the lemon juice to stand.,
Filter the lemon juice.,
Pour the lemon juice into glass bottles.,
Fill the neck of the bottle with olive oil.,
Cork the bottle.,
Remove the olive oil prior to use.",How to Preserve Lemon Juice4," For every 1 quart (1 liter) of juice, add about 1 ounce (30 ml) of cream of tartar. Cream of tartar has preservative qualities. Stir the two together until thoroughly mixed.

, Letting the juice stand at room temperature lets the cream of tartar and lemon juice combine more effectively. Stir the mixture frequently during this time.

, Remove pulp and chunks of un-dissolved chunks of cream of tartar by pouring the juice through muslin or a coffee filter rested inside of a strainer. Use a mesh strainer with small holes to achieve the best results.

, Use a funnel to prevent juice from spilling out as you pour.

, Olive oil is another natural preservative. It works by cutting off the supply of air to the contents of the bottle. As a result, air is unable to reach the lemon juice in the bottle, preventing it from spoiling.

, Tightly fit a cork or other seal into the mouth of the bottle.

, Do not shake the bottle when you open it, since doing so would combine the oil and juice. Once you do open it, pour off the oil from the top of the juice before using the juice itself.

Serve the lemonade over ice.",How to Make Lemonade1," The pitcher will need to be able to hold about 8 cups (1.90 liters) of liquid.;
, You will need 2 cups (450 milliliters) of lemon juice, which will take about eight to ten lemons. Cut the lemons in half, and use a citrus squeezer, a hand juicer, or a wooden reamer to squeeze the juice from the lemons.









To get more juice out of each lemon, roll the lemons across a flat surface while pressing down on them. Do this before cutting and juicing them. The rolling and pressing motion loosens the flesh inside and helps the lemons release more juice when you squeeze them., You may add the pulp if you like a thicker lemonade, or you may discard it along with the seeds. If you do not want the pulp, you can put a strainer over the pitcher, before pouring in the lemon juice. The strainer will catch the pulp. Once all of the juice is inside the pitcher, take the strainer off the pitcher and discard the pulp and seeds.

, You will need 6 cups (1.35 liters) of cold water. You can also use sparkling for a carbonated lemonade.








, You will need about 1 cup (225 grams) of sugar. If you'd like your lemonade to be less sweet, then use a little bit less sugar.








, You can use a large spoon or a whisk. Keep stirring until the sugar dissolves; there may be some sugar granules left at the bottom of the pitcher, which is normal. At this point, you can taste the lemonade to see if it needs to be sweeter or less sweet. Here are some suggestions:








If the lemonade is too sour, add a few tablespoons of sugar.
If the lemonade is too sweet, add the juice of half a lemon and a pinch of salt, if desired.

, Leave the lemonade in the fridge for about 3 hours.

, Put some ice cubes into a glass, and pour the lemonade into the glass. You can garnish the lemonade with a slice of lemon or a few mint leaves.

, Take six to eight lemons, cut them in half, and squeeze the juice from them using a citrus squeezer, a hand juicer, or a wooden reamer.









To get the most juice out of the lemons, roll the lemons across the counter, while pressing down on them, before cutting and juicing them. This loosens the flesh inside and helps the lemons release more juice when you squeeze them., If you'd like a thicker lemonade, then include the pulp. If you do not want the pulp in your lemonade, then place a sieve over the pitcher and pour the lemon juice through that. The mesh will catch any unwanted pulp. Once all the juice is in the pitcher, remove the sieve and discard the pulp and seeds.








, In this version, you will be making a simple syrup first. This will allow the sugar to dissolve more completely and prevent any sugar granules from sinking to the bottom of the pitcher.

, You will need 1 cup (225 grams) of sugar and 1 cup (225 milliliters) of water. Stir the sugar and water to combine.









Consider adding extra ingredients. You can make your lemonade even more flavorful by adding some herbs, such as lavender and thyme. If you choose to do this, you will need to pour the sugar-water through a sieve in order to catch the herbs. Refer to the section in this article on adding garnishes and extra ingredients for more ideas.

, Turn the stove on and bring the sugar and water to a simmer. Keep stirring until all of the sugar has dissolved and there are no grains.








, Once the sugar has dissolved, turn the stove off and take the saucepan off the burner. Slowly pour the sugar-water into the pitcher. If you added any extra ingredients to the sugar-water, such as herbs, put a sieve over the pitcher before pouring in the sugar-water. The sieve will catch any loose herbs.








, If you like your lemonade sweet, then use a little less water. If you like your lemonade less sweet, then use more water. You can also use sparkling water for a carbonated lemonade.








, Once you have everything in the pitcher, stir the lemonade using a long spoon or a whisk. At this point, you can taste the lemonade to see if it needs to be more sweet or less sweet. Here are some guidelines:








If the lemonade needs to be sweeter, add a few more tablespoons of sugar.
If the lemonade is too sweet, add the juice of half a lemon.

, Leave the lemonade in the fridge for 30 to 40 minutes.

, Once the lemonade has cooled down, take it out of the fridge. Drop a few ice cubes into a tall glass, and pour the lemonade over the ice. You may garnish it with some mint leaves or lemon slices.

",How to Make Lemonade3," You can make a sparkling lemonade using sparkling water instead of regular water. If you are making old-fashioned lemonade, use regular water when making the simple syrup, and sparkling water instead of regular water for the rest of the recipe., When making classic lemonade, use ½ cup (175 grams) of raw honey instead of 1 cup (225 grams) of sugar., When making the simple syrup for the old-fashioned lemonade, add one tablespoon of dried lavender flowers (food-grade) to the sugar-water and let the syrup cool for 30 minutes. Pour the syrup over a strainer when adding it to the lemon juice. The strainer will catch the lavender flowers, but will let the lavender-infused syrup drain through. Discard the flowers and stair the lemonade.The lavender-infused lemonade will not be purple. If you wish to give it a lavender color, add one to two drops of purple food coloring and stir. If you do not have purple food coloring, add one drop of red food coloring and one drop of blue food coloring. Be sure to stir the lemonade well to blend all of the colors.

, When making the simple syrup for your old-fashioned lemonade, add ½ cup (15 grams) of fresh basil, thyme, or mint leaves to the sugar water and bring it to a boil. Once it comes to a boil, take the saucepan off the burner and turn the stove off.

, For best results, use sea salt.



Optional: Add a sprig of thyme, two bay leaves, and the juice of one lemon to the water. This will make the water into more of a broth than brine.
Purists will probably want to stick to a simple brine. If you plan to eat your lobster with melted butter, you do not need to make a broth.

, A rolling boil is when the water does not stop boiling when you stir the water.


You want a rolling boil to ensure the water will boil even after the lobster is put into the pot, reducing the temperature of the water momentarily.

, A couple things to consider as you put your lobster into the pot:


Leave the rubber bands on the pincers of the lobster until just before you submerge them in the pot. Their pincers are strong and can cause injury. Grab the lobster by the back of the carapace while doing this.
Place the lobster into the water head in first.
Try placing all the lobsters you are going to cook into the pot as quickly as possible. If you are cooking multiple lobsters, get them all into the water at the same time so you can remove them at the same time.

,,, To tell whether the lobster is fully cooked, try:


Testing for color. A fully cooked lobster is deep red. An uncooked lobster has a charcoal-type color.
Tugging on an antennae. It should come off easily when the lobster is fully cooked.
Testing the meat. A fully cooked lobster will have firm, white, opaque skin. Uncooked meat will still be loose and translucent.
Testing the roe (or eggs) in female lobster. The roe will be orange-reddish and firm in cooked lobster and dark green or black in uncooked lobster.

",How to Blind Bake a Pie Crust,"






;
,









Docking a pie crust is when you put little holes all over it to keep steam that forms underneath your pie crust when it cooks from expanding your pie crust.
You can use a fork or a pastry docker to prick the pie crust all over.

,









Leave enough overhang that you can easily remove the covering without burning yourself on the pie pan.
This step is necessary for all types of blind-baked pie crusts.

,









Weights are needed at the beginning of baking to keep the pie crust from puffing up.
You can buy a special string of pie weights at a store with a good selection of baking tools.
Many cooks use dried beans or rice that they save as pie weights. This is a less expensive option than buying special pie weights and works just as well, although the dried beans or rice can be more difficult to deal with when they are hot.
Fill the pie crust up to the top with the weights.
You do not need to use weights when blind baking a crumb crust.

,









This step is not necessary for crumb crusts.

,









For a crust that must be entirely baked before the filling is added, bake 20 minutes with the weights in place.
For a crust in which the filling will be baked, bake the pie crust for 15 minutes with the weights in place.

,









All types of blind baked crusts should be uncovered at this point.

,









A crust that needs to be fully baked before the filling is added should be placed back in the oven uncovered for an additional 15 minutes.
A crust that will be baked more with the filling in place does not require more baking at this time before the filling is added.

,









If you are filling your blind baked pie crust with a filling that does not require cooking, allow it to cool and then fill it.
If you are filling your pie crust with a filling that requires further baking, fill it and return it to the oven.
Blind-baked pie crusts can also be wrapped well and frozen at this time.

,









Bake your pie crust until the filling is done at the temperature suggested by the filling recipe.

Check the freshness of fresh yeast.,
Prepare fresh yeast to be used.,
Proof fresh yeast to activate it.,
Add your activated yeast to the remaining ingredients in your recipe.

",How to Activate Fresh Yeast," Your senses are all that is necessary to determine how fresh your fresh yeast is. The color should be consistently ivory with no dark spots or color alterations. The texture should be moist yet crumbly with no hard spots. The odor should smell pleasantly of yeast. If the yeast cake has dark spots or color alterations or has any hard spots, it has gone bad and should be discarded. Do not continue with your recipe until you have a new, fresh yeast cake.;
, Fresh yeast comes in a solid chunk or cake. Crumble the amount needed for your selected recipe into a bowl. You can also place the amount you need in the bowl and break it apart using a spoon.

, Part of the purpose of proofing yeast is to give a final decree on determining its freshness. To activate fresh yeast, follow the process of feeding it and evaluating its response. Do not use yeast that does not respond to proofing.

Feed your fresh yeast. Yeast, similar to when a human or animal is fed, responds to the consumption of the food and water. Activate fresh yeast by mixing it with the warm water called for in the recipe and, if applicable, the sugar. The water must be at the perfect temperature between 90 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit (32 to 38 degrees Celsius). If the water is cooler, the yeast will not activate. If the water is hotter, the yeast will be killed. Add the warm water to the yeast in your bowl.






Stir the yeast and water mixture thoroughly. Stir until the yeast is dissolved completely. The texture may be a little thick and pasty.






Place the bowl in a warm location that is free from drafts. Yeast needs warmth in order to grow. Pay attention that the location is not so warm, however, that it kills or prematurely cooks the yeast.






Wait. Yeast takes between 5 to 10 minutes to activate. It should be foamy or show signs of expansion.

Let your steak reach room temperature.,

Cook a steak with in the pan and the oven.",How to Season a Steak," Pat your steak dry with paper towels and allow it to come to room temperature during the seasoning process. Yes, it takes a little extra time to get the finished product, but when that finished product is more tender, is juicier, and boasts a quicker cooking time, the extra time is well worth it.









Why let the steak come to room temperature before cooking? First, a steak that has come to room temperature will cook more evenly.You won't have a hot exterior and a chilly interior. Second, the steak will cook quicker. This means less time on the grill, or the frying pan, or in the oven, and more time spent sipping wine.
Will letting your steaks come to room temperature affect their taste or make the cuts go bad? No. Letting a steak sit for 30 to 60 minutes shouldn't affect the taste or smell of the meat, and will not cause the meat to go bad. More bacteria will multiply the longer you let it sit out, but those bacteria will be killed on contact with proper heat.;
, Since you obviously cannot ""salt to taste,"" it's sometimes hard to know how much salt is enough. Many chefs recommend this benchmark as a good guide for pre-seasoning meat.








Salt your steak at least 40 minutes before you cook it. Most cooks salt their steaks right before placing it on the grill. Because salt is a desiccant, this draws the moisture out to the surface of the steak, where it gets seared off immediately. This produces mostly an underwhelming steak. Instead of seasoning with salt right before you place it on the grill, salt at least 40 minutes to an hour ahead of time. This allows the moisture to return into the steak as well as tenderize the meat.
When you salt at least 40 minutes in advance of cooking, the moisture drawn out to the surface by the salt has time to seep back into the meat.This process is called osmosis, and it happens very slowly, which is why it takes time. The moisture that travels back into the steaks is now well-salted and flavorful.
This salting process also tenderizes the meat by breaking down proteins. Broken-down proteins mean a softer, more succulent steak.

, Olive oil has a distinct, crisp flavor that many cooks love, although you might prefer a more neutral oil, such as groundnut or canola oil. Use no more than a teaspoon for each pound of meat.








, Many chefs prefer to season their steaks after they've finished cooking them because pepper can char while cooking and impart a slightly burned flavor. Some chefs don't worry about charring, believing it to give the steaks a heartier flavor. Experiment with both methods and see which one turns out best for you.









For the best flavor, grind your peppercorns yourself in a pepper mill immediately before use. Do not buy pre-ground pepper, as it will get stale. Freshly-ground pepper makes a world of difference.

, Great-tasting cuts of steak don't need fancy seasonings or marinades to taste good. In fact, great-tasting cuts of steak probably taste worse-off after a complex bath of herbs, aromatics, and spices. If you're frying a nice T-bone or porterhouse, or grilling a filet-mignon, stick with nice and simple for best results.








, Chances are you already have most of the ingredients in your own pantry, so why not try to make it yourself? Combine:









2 tablespoons crushed black pepper
2 tablespoons kosher salt
1 tablespoons paprika
1 tablespoon granulated garlic
1 tablespoon granulated onion
1 tablespoon crushed coriander
1 tablespoon dill
1 tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes

, If you want to give your steak a not-so-average rub, try this flavorful blend of spices and seasonings:









4 teaspoons salt, or to taste
2 teaspoons paprika
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
3/4 teaspoon onion powder
3/4 teaspoon garlic powder
3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
3/4 teaspoon ground coriander
3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric

, This seasoning has a little bit of everything in it — heat, spice, sweetness, and tang:









1 tablespoon kosher salt
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon ground coriander
2 teaspoons mustard powder
2 teaspoons ground coffee
1 teaspoon unsweetened cocoa powder
½ teaspoon ancho chili powder
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
½ teaspoon ground cloves
⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper

, Grilling is the quintessential summer cooking method. Grab a few beers, heat up the barbecue, and get at it. If you can, make sure to use charcoal instead of gas, and for goodness sake, make sure your grill has different heat stations for best results!








, Probably a little less fussy than grilling, pan-frying allows you to get your steak out of the refrigerator and into your stomach in record time. Although pan-frying is less healthy than oven-roasting or grilling, some contend that nothing's better than a fresh fried steak.








, Heat up your broiler for a healthier and no-nonsense steak. Cooking over high heat makes this method a little more risky than other methods if you're after medium-rare meat, but with the right technique, broiled steak often tastes unparalleled.








, Start your steak off in the pan and end it in the oven for a ridiculously juicy steak that's crisp and brown on the outside and succulent on the inside.

Note your existing supplies and consider where the menu can be expanded.,
Use leftovers creatively.,
Serve an appetizer or an hors d'oeuvres.,
Rely on classic fillers.,
Adjust your cooking time for unexpected or delayed arrivals.,
Make meat and fish go further.,
Make vegetables stretch.,
Consider dessert and after dinner extensions.,
Plan for the future to make your day easier.",How to Stretch a Meal," With practice, you can easily learn how to pad out existing ingredients or recipes, such as increasing a homemade pan of pasta sauce with an extra can of tomato puree, or bulking up with extra ingredients in the main dish. If you have extra fresh ingredients in your refrigerator, adding a simple salad or other vegetable side dishes can make a meal go much further. Don't be too wed to the exactness of a recipe that you're used to making––a good cook can usually work out how the addition of more ingredients can be balanced without overpowering or spoiling the dish.;
, If you have some leftover vegetables from last night, they simply need warming through and not cooking again from scratch. This makes them ideal candidates for quick and easy bulked up meals. Depending on their state, vegetables may be reheated and mixed with a little lemon juice, chopped herbs and melted butter (if available); mashed into bubble and squeak fritters; folded into a frittata or omelette; or chopped and added to a sauce or stew.


In very dire circumstances, clean vegetable peelings and trimmings (from onion, celery, carrot, etc.) can make a basic, tasty vegetable stock. When starchy vegetable peels (such as potato) or leftover vegetables are added, boiled, pureed and seasoned, the result can make a good vegetable soup. This soup can be served in small glasses, (such as shot glasses or small coffee cups) with cut triangles of toasted bread as a crouton for a trendy appetizer. Leftover meat such as chicken, or frozen vegetables such as peas and corn can also be added to this soup to stretch it even further.
Leftover vegetables can be chopped up, mixed with ricotta cheese (you can even make your own at home!), mix with a beaten egg, salt and pepper and a little nutmeg and use as a filler in cannelloni pasta, in puff pastry triangles (such as the classic cheese and spinach triangles), or mix with curry powder (to taste) and wrap in short crust pastry to bake or fry to make samosas.

, This can be simply some nuts, cut fruit and vegetables with a dipping sauce, bread or cracker biscuits with some cheese, or some pre-made or frozen appetizer that can be quickly prepared and served. An appetizer is not only good for digestion because it stimulates the appetite, it can help to reduce the amount of food you may eat. This is a common trick of cafes and restaurants that serve garlic bread as an entrée, or bread and olive oil for dipping, as you're more likely to enjoy your meal and less likely to leave the table hungry.


If you have a supply of eggs, an omelette is a quick and easy entrée. Or, the eggs can be boiled, sliced and served on bread with some mayonnaise or spicy sauce.
Frozen puff pastry sheets can be spread with cheese and mustard, cheese and black pepper or cream cheese based flavored dips (such as with Mexican spices), then either cut into small finger sized portions and baked, or rolled up, sliced and baked as ""snails"" as a quick and easy appetizer. Keep an eye on them as they cook within a few minutes in a hot oven.
Pickled olives, peppers, onions, gherkins and other preserved foods such as cheese can quickly be served to make an easy antipasto or tapas style entrée/first course.It's all about being creative with what you have!

, Breads, rice, pasta and noodles, canned beans, polenta and other farinaceous (flour/ground grain based) foods are good fillers. If you cannot stretch a stew or casserole with meat or vegetables, you can serve extra carbohydrates either as a side dish or within the sauce. Classic examples include beans to stretch a beef chili or a soup and pizza––one of the most famous ways to stretch minimal ingredients by spreading them onto bread dough.


Try dumplings. Soups and stews can be made heartier by adding dumplings, which are quick and easy to make and use ingredients from the pantry.
When making meat go further, potatoes and rice are your allies. Add them to meat curries or stews to bulk them out.

, If you're cooking rice and pasta (and most vegetables), you will need to cook a new batch separately if the guests are really unexpected, rather than add raw ingredients to a half cooked batch. Often when serving, use the first cooked batch and by the time you have plated up, the second batch is usually cooked. Keeping guests informed is usually the simplest way to allay the fears of anyone that they might go hungry!


For pasta and rice, you can keep the first batch warm and covered until the later batch is ready, by stirring just enough butter or oil through to prevent them from sticking (do not run pasta under cold water when you intend to leave it sitting––it will stick together and begin to break down, leaving a mush at serving time).
When cooking vegetables in batches, it's best to take the first batch off the heat and drain them when they are still crisp and just slightly under-cooked, as the residual time while they are kept warm will continue to cook them. Then, if you have balanced the time proportionately, the vegetables should be equally cooked.

, Often the most expensive part of a meal, meat and fish can be expanded without loss of enjoyment. Here are some great ways to do this:

Cut or slice meat portions. You can still serve meat attractively in sliced portions and few guests will notice. With meat like chops or cutlets, slicing them off the bone and serving the sliced meat is the only way to go to make sure there is enough to go around.






Chop away the meat portions. Originally you had a chicken drumstick for each diner or a steak for each person. Not anymore––resort to chopping the meat up into smaller portions and turn these pieces of meat into a dish. Either turn the pieces into a stir-fry, curry, stew or pot pie (simply add pastry over the top and a cheesy sauce as filler) or serve the pieces rather than the whole if this can pulled off without looking stingy. Neatly chopping the meat can give the impression that it is meant to be served that way, rather than whole. Add plenty of vegetables and perhaps a dollop of couscous or Aquino, which both cook quickly and supplement the protein. Another trick is to make a neat bed of rice or grain (shape it using a glass or other small container to make a tower), then layer the meat pieces carefully on top and add a few sprigs of herb or sprouts to complete the ""artsy"" food.






Fish fillets: When you only have four fillets to go around and six guests, change your approach. If raw, skin them and either make fish cakes/patties; cut them into strips or long wedge-shaped portions and then crumb them and fry them; make fish balls or turn them into a pate with lots of toast slices and make a quick soup to accompany. When cooked, the fillets may be lightly shredded and served cold mixed with mayonnaise or tartar sauce, or mixed with shredded ginger, chopped chili, lime juice, sugar to taste, chopped herbs and fish sauce for a Thai or Vietnamese style fish salad.







, If you haven't got enough vegetables to go around, there are plenty of ways to make it seem as if you have. This includes:


Break vegetables down even further. For example, if you have a cauliflower or broccoli, make the floret divisions even smaller than normal. By keeping them small and evenly sized, they look like a larger portion. Instead of slicing carrots, dice them. Chopping will always make it seem like there is more to go around than slicing.
Use extra parts of the vegetables. The stems of broccoli are delicious when cut into finger-like strips and cooked with the rest of the florets, they often take around the same cooking time. The leaves of cauliflower and broccoli can be stir fried or sauteed in a little butter and stock or bouillon until tender. Potato and starchy vegetable skins can be washed and fried or baked until crisp and seasoned to make a tasty appetizer or garnish.
Combine vegetables with eggs. Adding eggs to vegetables can make the most of the vegetables by turning them into omelettes, self-crusting quiches, egg-based pies, frittata, bubble and squeak, scrambled eggs, etc. The addition of vegetables dresses up these dishes considerably, which means that in some cases, they can also be used for a casual dinner party.
Supplement in-season vegetables with out-of-season frozen vegetables (and berry fruits for desserts) that are on sale. Supermarkets put frozen food on sale regularly and this is your opportunity to supplement the cheaper in-season fresh vegetables for little cost. By balancing the frozen food with fresh food, you're still assured of getting all your nutrients. And by sticking mostly to in-season vegetables, you save money and food miles.
Throw the vegetables you do have into a lasagna. You'll be amazed at what can go in a lasagna and still taste absolutely delicious. The tomato and cheese sauces cover the flavor and texture of any multitude of odd ingredients! Vegetables can be chopped or sliced for lasagna, either making their own layers (such as zucchini or mashed pumpkin etc) or chopped and folded into the tomato sauce (such as cabbage, celery, carrot, peas etc).
Make vegetable soup and add plenty of thickeners such as potato, rice and even flour. If the soup seems a bit light, add dumplings or beans, or use pasta such as macaroni or risoni pieces to help to bulk it out.

, Quite often all you can do is simply reduce the portion sizes of the main meals to go around which still may not be enough to make a satisfying meal. The option is to expand on dessert by incorporating more fresh fruit, any cake or sweet bread or use cream or ice cream (if available). Pancakes can be a quick and easy dessert recipe or dessert extender using common pantry and fridge ingredients. Otherwise tea, coffee, cheese and biscuits and other old fashioned fare can help to stretch out a meal to be more satisfying.


What to do when you've made individual desserts but not enough: In many cases, division of desserts will just look awful––imagine the mousse with a big chunk pulled out or the baked apple sliced in half. One answer is to offer a selection of desserts and woe betide the diner who is too slow to pick their choice first! As well as the original amount of individual desserts, throw in a few separate bowls of fruit salad, a container of whipped cream (flavored with liqueur or juice to improve its desirability) and perhaps a platter of cheese and crackers. Place it all on the table in the center or create a side buffet and ask guests to help themselves.
If the original dessert was reasonably fluid or sloppy, tip the individual portions back into one bowl and mix together. This is often a good quick fix for mousse/custard/gelled style dishes. Cover the top of the new dessert with whipped cream/custard/coulis/sifted icing sugar to hide the damage and provide a small serving spoon to discourage large helpings; again, some fruit salad (even if from a can) and additional whipped cream will help the new dessert stretch further.

, Whether you entertain often or rarely, purchase in bulk, portion, freeze or store and cook––this is a simple way to ensure that you have plenty of supplies. Buying frozen peas in large packs is a basic example that many people already do, but this can also work for various freezer safe foods and precooked meals, such as soups, sauces (including surplus tomato puree), vegetable dishes, pastries, desserts and other foods that freeze well. This way, whenever you have unexpected guests, it is easy to take out an extra portion and, being smaller in size, it will be quicker to defrost and cook.


It tends to be more economical to purchase in bulk the foods that you cook often, portion them up and freeze them in cling film or freezer-safe containers. Or, for pantry items, store them in airtight containers. Good storage methods reduce food spoilage and waste.

Pre-heat your oven broiler.,
Slice the peppers and remove the tops.,
Cover a baking sheet or cookie pan with aluminum foil.,
Move your oven rack to the highest notch, then place the baking sheet on the rack.,
Leave the red peppers under the broiler for about 20 minutes.,
Remove the blackened red peppers from the oven.,
Remove the skin from the peppers.,
Put the roasted red peppers in a glass or plastic airtight container.",How to Roast Red Peppers1," While you do this, you can begin to prepare the peppers. Wash the red peppers under cool running water. Remove any labels or stickers. Alternately, you can turn your oven on to 400º-500ºF (204º-260ºC) if you'd like to cook them that way.;
, Place the red peppers on a cutting board. Cut the top, stem-end off, making the cut straight across. Cut each red pepper in half lengthwise. Eat the stem end of the pepper or put it in the refrigerator to use later. Use a paper towel or spoon to scoop out the seeds from the pepper. Leaving the seeds on won't harm you, but the peppers may not taste as good with the texture of the seeds getting in your way.


Some people just roast 'em whole and then cut them up and remove the seeds. This will work too, but it will make the peppers a bit more difficult to work with. If you do this, you'll also have to manually turn those peppers every few minutes, so you'll be giving yourself a bit more work to do. It will also take more like 40 minutes to cook them whole instead of 20 to cook them when they are cut in half.

, Place the red pepper halves on the aluminum foil with the skin side up. In the end, the skin will be charred, but you can peel it right off when you're done roasting the peppers.

, The peppers will be directly underneath the broiler. Turn on your oven fan, as the peppers may be smoky. Some people like to cook the peppers in the upper third of the oven, so they have room to soften up a bit as they char. You can open a window in the kitchen to keep the air fresh too.

, Keep going until the skin of the peppers gets nice and charred. It doesn't have to be 100% black, but it should be mostly black. Leave your oven door open a crack and check them every few minutes. Turn the pan if some are turning black sooner than others.

, Using tongs, place them in a zip-close bag. Or you can place the red peppers in a bowl, then cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Set the bag or bowl aside and leave the peppers to sit untouched for 20 minutes. Either way, you'll need to steam them a bit before you eat them so you can soften them up enough to remove the skin.

, Take each roasted red pepper from the plastic bag. The roasted peppers should be cool enough to handle, and the blackened skin should slide easily from the peppers.

, Cover with extra virgin olive oil, or use the marinade of your choice, which can include salt, pepper, and balsamic vinegar. The roasted red peppers will keep in the refrigerator for one to two weeks. Use these peppers on sandwiches or in salads, or just enjoy them on their own.

Place the peppers directly over the top of the gas flame.,
Roast them for 20-25 minutes.,
Remove the pepper from the stove and steam them.,
Open the foil.,
Prepare the pepper.",How to Roast Red Peppers2," You can only use your stove to roast red peppers if it isn't electric. This method is ideal if you're just roasting one or two peppers and don't want to spend the time necessary for using your oven.

, You can also use a single layer if you're using heavy duty foil. Just make sure that you've sealed your pepper nice and tight so that no parts of your peppers are directly exposed to the flame.

, Be careful when doing this. Make sure you stay in your kitchen the entire time and don't leave the peppers alone for a minute. You don't want juices from the peppers to get into the flame or for anything unexpected to happen. This method is easy, but it can be a bit messy, so it's important to watch over those peppers and to keep the juices from spilling everywhere.

, Use tongs to turn the pepper a quarter about every 4-5 minutes. This will ensure that the pepper gets a nice, even roast. After the 20-minute mark has passed, you can squeeze the pepper gently to check if it's ready. If it gives easily, it's ready; if it's a bit firm, you can roast it for another few minutes, checking on it every 2-3 minutes until it's ready.

, Let it sit for 15-20 minutes in its foil. It will steam in the foil; this will help the skins get nice and loose and will make them easier to peel.

, Be careful because it might still be hot. Gently use tongs to remove the pepper from the foil. It'll be soft, charred, and almost ready to eat.

, Now, you've got to gently remove those skins, cut those peppers, and use a paper towel or spoon to gently scoop out the seeds. Cut up the peppers as thinly as you like and enjoy them in your favorite foods. They are delicious when covered with a bit of olive oil.

Wrap the peppers in foil.,
Place the peppers on the open grill over a medium gas flame.,
Roast them for 15-20 minutes.,
Steam the peppers.,
Finished.

",How to Roast Red Peppers3," Wrap the peppers in two layers or one layer of heavy duty foil, making sure that you've got them completely covered. If you don't wrap them up, you'll still be able to roast them on your grill, but they can get a bit messy. You can, of course, just roast them without wrapping them if you don't mind the messiness.

, This will be hot enough to give them enough of a roast, but it won't be so strong that they'll get overly burned.

, Every few minutes, you should give them a quarter turn with tongs, just as you would do if you were roasting them over a gas grill. The peppers should feel charred and soft, and ready to collapse. This will let you know that you're finished. If they still feel tough, you can roast them for a few extra minutes, as long as you continue to check on them.

, Not done yet! Now you've got to carefully place the peppers in a sealed plastic bag or in a bowl covered with a plate so they can continue to cook and so that their skins become nice and soft and easy to remove. Do this for about 20 minutes if you want the peppers to be steamed to perfection. Then, you can cut off the tops of the peppers, gently remove the skin, and scoop out the seeds with a paper towel or fork and you're all done! Drizzle them with olive oil for best results.

To make the scrub, combine 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of liquid soap and 1 tablespoon (19 g) of salt in a small bowl.


You can use any type of liquid soap, including dish soap, laundry detergent, hand and body soap, or shampoo.
For the salt, you can use table, Himalayan, sea, kosher, coarse, or any other type of salt.
As an alternative to the exfoliating salt, you can also use toothpaste, coffee grounds, or baking soda;
, Scoop the soap and salt scrub into your hands. Scrub the paste into your hands, including your palms, back of your hands, wrists, in between your fingers, and under your nails. When you’ve thoroughly scrubbed your hands, rinse them under cold water to remove the scrub and the majority of the onion smell.









For the most effective cleaning, use a nail brush to scrub the soap and salt into your skin and under your nails., When your hands are still wet, find something made of stainless steel, such as a pot, colander, utensil, or other metal object in the kitchen or around the house. Hold the item under running water and rub it on your hands the way you would with a bar of soap. Do this for a full minute.









Stainless steel may have the power to neutralize the sulfur molecules on your hands that cause the onion smell, so rubbing your hands with stainless steel might remove leftover odors.You can also buy an odor-eliminating stainless steel bar that’s specifically designed for washing hands and removing onion, garlic, and fish smells. These are available online and at home and bath stores.

, To remove any lingering onion odors, dampen a clean cloth with vinegar or lemon juice and rub it all over your hands. Be sure to get in between your fingers, under your nails, and other areas where onion smell might be hiding. Let the vinegar or juice air dry, and then rinse your hands with clean water. As an alternative to lemon juice and vinegar, you can also try:








Peanut butter
Tomato juice
Celery juice
Potato juice
Mustard
Alcohol
Aloe
Mint leaves

, The smell of onions can actually stay on your breath for a few days after eating them. Luckily, there are certain foods you can eat after having onions to get rid of onion breath. For fresh breath after an onion dish, try eating or drinking:Kiwi
Fresh parsley
Raw mushrooms
Eggplant
Raw apples
Lemon juice
Green tea

, Cut onions will stay freshest if you store them in an air-tight container, but this often leaves the container smelling of onions as well. To get rid of this smell from plastic containers:








Wash the dish with hot, soapy water
Rinse the dish with water
Wipe the dish with a cloth that’s damp with vinegar or lemon juice, or sprinkle in some baking soda
Leave the dish in the sun to air dry

, Onions taste great in dishes, but not too many people like when their house keeps smelling like onions for days after cooking them. There are a few ways you can absorb onion cooking smells from your house, and some of the most popular include:








Combine equal parts vinegar and water in a saucepan and simmer it over medium heat for at least an hour.
Alternatively, you can also fill a bowl with plain vinegar and leave it near the stove overnight.
Fill a small saucepan with water and add lemon, orange, and other citrus peels. Bring the water to a boil and simmer it for at least an hour.
Pour ¼ cup (55 g) of baking soda into a spray bottle and fill the bottle the rest of the way with water. Shake well and spray liberally around the house, and especially in the kitchen.

, When you cook with onions, the smell tends to get into everything, including the clothes you're wearing. To get rid of that onion smell from fabrics, hang the clothes somewhere to air out. Mix equal parts vodka or rubbing alcohol and water in a spray bottle. Shake well and spray the affected garments. Leave the clothes to air dry.








You can also use this method to remove cooking smells from furniture, drapes, and other fabrics.

, Onion smell even gets into your hair, and this can be difficult to remove sometimes. When your hair does smell like onions, or other cooking smells, get rid of the odor by:Mix ⅛ cup (29 ml) of shampoo with a teaspoon (5 g) of baking soda and a tablespoon (5 ml) of lemon juice.
Wash your hair with the mixture, lathering thoroughly and rubbing the mixture into your scalp as well.
Rinse your hair with clean water.

, Vinegar is great for absorbing smells, and it may even prevent your hands from absorbing onion smell when you're chopping. Before you cut an onion, dip your hands in vinegar, and then pat them dry. Cut the onion as usual.









Be very careful when using a knife, especially if your hands are damp.

, One of the best ways to prevent onion smell on your hands is to protect your hands when you're chopping, and you can do this with latex or latex-alternative gloves. Before you chop the onion, put on a pair of snug-fitting gloves, and don’t take the gloves off until you're finished with the onion.You can use the same trick to prevent garlic and fish smells on your hands.

, Another trick to prevent your hands from smelling like onions is to avoid chopping them! When you do need to use onions in a dish, peel them first, and then use a food processor to cut them up. That way, you get to cut your onions and your hands will stay fresh and clean smelling.

Research your local fish suppliers to determine where the best quality product is available from.,
Purchase tilapia live if at all possible.,
Smell the fish or filets before buying.,
Inspect the eyes if you are buying the fish whole to make sure they are clear.,
Search the wrapping or packaging if you are buying filets.,
Buy your tilapia as close to the time you wish to cook it as possible.",How to Buy Tilapia Fish," Ask the fishmonger at your grocery store or seafood supplier where their tilapia comes from and how it was grown. Because tilapia meat retains the flavor of the water the fish swam in, these facts are important to know. If your supplier doesn't know, this could be an indicator of poor quality and you should try another supplier.;
, Make sure the fish are swimming in clear water and appear lively and healthy. The fish should be swimming in the tank as opposed to floating motionless, and their eyes should be clear and bright. If live fish are not an option in your area, choose freshly cut filets that are packed in thin layers of ice and are not frozen through. The ice should only be enough to keep the meat cold, not to freeze it solid.

, Fresh tilapia should remind you of the sea. If it smells ""fishy"" or musky, it's likely an older catch, and should be avoided.

, Eyes that are slimy or murky indicate the fish is past its prime. Also check the gills to make sure they are dirt-free, and make sure the scales are clean and shiny, and not flaking or peeling.

, Tilapia meat will absorb the taste of water it sits in, so if there is standing water, it may give your filets a bad taste. Avoid purchasing filets that appear to be sitting in excess liquid.

, Though filets can be kept at 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius) for as long as 2 days. But the longer the fish sit, the more flavor they lose. Optimally, you should be buying the fish the just hours before you will be cooking it.

",How to Buy Peas in the Pod," Pods that are split open means that the peas are overripe and they will not taste as good and may be starchy. Overripe peas can still be used for soups and stews, however.;
, The best pods will have a fresh colour. Duller pods are older and have probably been sitting around for a while.,, Shelling peas causes the sugar in them to quickly deteriorate., Fresh, good peas should ""pop"" or crack as they are being shelled., This is an indication that they have dried out.

Be prepared.,

Plan out meals with calendars or menu planners.,

Use the internet.,

Take out supplies beforehand.,

Cut vegetables in batches and store in the refrigerator in containers.,

Make seasonings in advance.,

Save time with slow cooker recipes.,

Prepare meals in batches and freeze them.,

Clean as you go.",How to Save Time in the Kitchen,"
Preparing in advance will significantly make tasks and time more organized. Much of this article is about good advance preparation that will ensure you have what you need in front of you and you're not left wondering what to cook or where the ingredients to cook it are.

Keep a well-stocked fridge and pantry. Keep a shopping list for items that are needed each shopping trip. Having ingredients available always speeds things up instead of having to find substitutions, change recipe ideas or even head off to the store.
Use quality kitchen tools and cooking equipment. While they may cost more initially, they work better and therefore speed up your cooking time while ensuring safety and good outcomes.
Be organized in your food storage, using labels and ensuring that food is used up while fresh. A little bit of initial effort to organize a pantry and fridge so that they allow for easy and fast food finding will speed up your daily cooking routine.;
,
The worst (and slowest) start to making a meal is by standing in front of an open pantry wondering what to make. By using a calendar, you can jot down what each person in the family likes, and even set aside some days for meals outside of the kitchen. Preparing meals for one might be easier or harder to plan in advance, depending on the ingredients you have; follow whatever works best for you when cooking for one but don't skimp on healthy choices!

Read How to cook just for yourself, How to plan dinner menus for the family and How to plan a meal using only what's in your pantry for more ideas.

,
In those situations where you do open the pantry door and wonder what to cook, choose several ingredients and type them into your search engine of choice along with the word ""recipe"". Exact matches incorporating those ingredients will return, enabling you to quickly choose a recipe that you like and can get on with preparing. Doing this is a lot faster than both wondering what to do or hunting for recipes in cookbooks while hungry!,
Before you go to bed or leave the house in the morning, place any pots, pans, measuring utensils, different bowl sizes, spice containers, and appliances that are tucked away on the countertops. When you're ready to start, everything is all set for you and this not only cuts the preparation time but provides you with the motivation to start preparing the meal.


Setting the table in advance is also an advantage. Ask older kids to help you set up a placement for each person. In fact, it's never too early to teach kids how to set the table, so encourage them to do so from a young age.

,
Whether you're having tacos, stir fry, casseroles, or salads, using Tupperware or similar containers to store pre-cut ingredients will save on preparation time. With the ingredients already prepared, this can also be a motivation to eat healthier for breakfast and lunch, such as quick fix salads or vegetable omelets.

Do tedious, non-cutting preparations elsewhere. When you're in front of the computer or watching television, you can easily snap beans at the same time.

,
If you have a favorite recipe that uses spice mixes and seasonings, measure out the ingredients in separate snack or sandwich plastic bags. Secure them tightly and stash them away for future uses.,
Thick meats, such as pot roasts, are excellent for beef stew. Add vegetable chunks, such as onions, carrots, and potatoes with the sauce or cooking wine of your choice. Leave it up to the slow cooker to do the rest for at least 8 hours.

Read How to use a slow cooker for more details.

,
Recipes such as lasagna, pies and casseroles can be prepared in advanced and divided. Cook one portion for that night and freeze the rest for future meals.

,
Even before preparing anything, start filling up the sink with a mixture of dish soap and hot water. Wash cutting boards in between cutting vegetables, meat, and fish and place them upright to dry. Wash any bowls, knives, and measuring utensils that won't be used again and leave them to air dry. While the meal is being cooked, utilize this time to continue any cleaning or putting away dishes in the dishwasher. By following the clean-as-you-go method, at the end of the meal the only things you need to worry about are the dishes on the table!"

Measure the weight of the prepared hips and add about half the amount of weight in water.,
Simmer the hips and water together until soft.,
Add equal weight of sugar to the pulp.,
Use the rosehip jam.",How to Use Rosehips in Cookery2," For 450g (15.8 oz) of hips, 250ml (8.4 fl. oz) of water is a close approximate guide.

, This will take about 15-20 minutes; it takes less time if they're covered with a lid. Puree the hips or push them through a sieve or mouli to pulp them. Measure the pulp's weight.

, Bring to a boil. Test the readiness by placing a sample on a cold plate to see if it gels. If it does, then it is ready for storing in hot, sterilised jars. If it does not gel, boil rapidly for another minute and test again.

,


Spread straight onto toast.
Rosehip jam can be stirred into muffins and biscuits or cookies.
Stir into meats. Rosehip jam has an interesting flavour that works well with chicken, pork, or other white meats such as turkey. It can be blended with a little mustard for an interesting sweet and sour sauce, or with BBQ sauce and soy sauce (to taste) for a flavour similar to Hoisin sauce.

Decide which greens you want for your salad.,
Check for bright colors.,
Make sure greens are crisp.,
Smell the leaves to determine freshness.,
Pack loose salad greens in plastic bags.,
Choose tubs instead of bags if they are available.,
Check the expiration date.,
Inspect the greens for color and freshness.",How to Buy Salad Greens," There are many types of lettuce and greens to choose from. Use a variety of flavors and textures including iceberg and romaine lettuce as well as other greens such as chicory, arugula, escarole, radicchio, beet greens, watercress, and loose-leaf lettuces. Some stores and markets will sell their own mix of greens, which might be called mesclun mix or spring mix.

, Make sure the leafy greens are a rich, bright green. Other lettuces such as iceberg will have a lighter green color. Different varieties might also contain red colors, and a white or yellow stem. Make sure there is no browning or yellowing of the leaves.

, Most stores and markets provide spoons or tongs to pick up the loose lettuces. Use these to bag your greens. They should retain their shape and texture and not be wilted or too soft.

, Salad greens should smell sweet, and a little bit earthy. If they smell too bitter or dull, that is an indication of how they will taste in your salad.

, Tie or seal the bags, and keep them separate from your other groceries, especially raw meats and poultry items.

, The greens stay fresher in plastic tubs than they do in bags. They are often cheaper when you buy larger quantities in the tubs. Store them on the bottom of the refrigerator for longer shelf life.;
, The date printed is the date that the salad greens will probably begin to rot. Vegetables that are expired will not taste as good as fresh vegetables. Buy what you will be able to use in less than 1 week.

, Tubs and plastic bags are often transparent. Shake the container to make sure the salad moves freely, and look for any signs of rot or moldy lettuces.

Review online directories, phone books and public fliers looking for farms offering food for sale, and local butcher shops, bakeries and other food suppliers.,
Visit local farmers markets to purchase seasonal produce and other foods.,
Learn which food items are available during specific seasons in your area and how to preserve foods.",How to Buy Local Food,"


Some areas have food cooperatives where you can collectively purchase local food with other buyers. This drives prices down since you can buy in large quantities, and it also allows you the convenience of being able to shop for all your food items in a single supermarket-like environment.
Locally-owned ethnic food stores are often easily accessible sources of high-quality, locally-produced food.;
,


If you find a producer with whom you are satisfied, ask about making arrangements to purchase food on a year-round basis. Many farmers may be able to provide more food than what they have displayed on a particular day at the farmer's market.
Farmers may also be able to provide information on how to best store, cook and prepare the food they sell, especially if you are purchasing something you've never tried before.

,


Those who exclusively buy locally are not able to have any type of food they desire available year-round. Often they must purchase only seasonal produce, and must stock up on meat during certain times of the year when animals are slaughtered. In order to prolong the amount of time you have to consume your food, invest in a stand-alone freezer and learn how to can and dehydrate produce.

Shop in kosher supermarkets or supermarkets with kosher foods.,
Note there are three categories of kosher foods: dairy, meat, and pareve.,
Familiarize yourself with Hechsher symbols, which are special certifications that indicate kosher food preparation and packaging.,
Look for the hechsher symbols on all breakfast cereals, cheese, baked goods, sauces, pasta, canned fish, frosting, dressings, ice cream, pudding, desserts, candy, cake mixes, preserves, condiments, relish, ground spices and margarine.,
Purchase kosher food in bakeries and butcher shops that are supervised by rabbis to be certain that the foods are truly kosher.,
Check to make sure fish have fins and scales, as fish without fins are not kosher.,
Learn which products do not require kosher certification.,
Eat hard cheese that is certified by an Orthodox rabbi.",How to Buy Kosher Food,";
, Pareve foods are neutral foods such as bread, fruits and vegetables that have not had contact with dairy or meat, and are not prepared with dairy or meat. Pareve foods are kosher unless they are combined with dairy or meat foods.

, Look online for a list of hechsher symbols printed on kosher food packages in various nations. A simple capital ""K"" does not necessarily mean food preparation was supervised by a rabbi, but some reliable Hechsher symbols incorporate a K.


Talk to your Orthodox rabbi about reliable Hechshers.
Note that an ""R"" in a circle does not indicate kosher foods. It indicates a registered trademark.

, Be sure all prepared foods such as soups and French fries, were prepared with rabbinic supervision and have a kosher mark.

, A rabbi will make certain the proper ingredients are used and that kosher goods won't be prepared on equipment used to prepare non-kosher foods. A rabbi will also make certain the meat is drained of blood and salted, per kosher laws.


If you shop for meats and poultry in a supermarket, buy whole kosher chickens with a plumba attached, which is a small metal tag with a hechsher. If a kosher chicken is cut up, the plumba will be attached to the bag. Buy kosher meats only from the front quarters of the animal. Be sure the meat is prepared under rabbinic supervision by a butcher deemed reliable in kosher practice.

, Fish must have scales that can be removed with a knife or by hand without ripping the underlying skin.

, If the product grew from the earth and is not mixed with any oils or other products, it is automatically kosher. This includes nuts (which may be salted), flour, wheat, oats, vegetables, fruits, popcorn, coffee, raisins, soybeans, rice, spices, sugar, tea, coffee and some liquors.

, Some rabbis say rennet, used to make certain cheeses, is made from calves' stomachs, and therefore can't be mixed with dairy under kosher laws. Other rabbis says rennet is processed in a way that it is acceptable to eat hard cheese prepared with rennet. Milk, butter and cream are deemed kosher.

Choose a type of cut.,
Select a curing method.,
See what kind of wood is used during cooking.,
Try non-pork products.,
Use Canadian bacon.,
Cook with pancetta.,
Try non-meat bacons.,
Read the ingredients label.,
Watch out for nitrates.,
Go for locally sourced bacon.,
Be skeptical of uncured bacon.,
Cook bacon properly.",How to Buy Bacon," The type of cut you want depends on what you plan to use the bacon for. The cut of bacon determines its thickness.Most bacon is standard cut, which comes in strips that are 1/16 of an inch. Thick cut bacon is slightly larger than standard cut. The strips are generally twice as thick as standard bacon. Both of these can be used in typical breakfast foods, but thick cut may be better as an addition to pastas and soups.
Center-cut is cut close to the bone. It generally has about 30% less fat than other cuts. If you're looking to cut down on fat, go with center cut.
You can also buy a slab of bacon at the butcher's counter. This bacon is uncut, allowing you to determine thickness by yourself.;
, Curing is the process of adding salt and spices to bacon to give it its distinct flavor. There are various curing methods used for bacon.Most bacon is wet-cured. Wet-cured bacon is brined in salt water and preservatives. The majority of supermarket bacon is wet-cured. If a bacon's curing method is not listed, it was likely wet-cured.
Dry-cured bacon is rubbed with salt and spices rather than brined. You can dry-cur your own bacon, or look for dry-cured bacons at your supermarket.
Uncured bacon is not really uncured. All bacon goes through a curing process. If you see bacon labeled as uncured, it means the product uses more natural ingredients during the process. If you're adverse to chemical preservatives, you may want to look for uncured bacon.

, Bacon is grilled on a variety of different surfaces. The type of wood used to cook bacon can affect its taste.Hickory-smoked bacon generally tastes the most like classic bacon. If you're looking for a classic breakfast food, try this type of bacon.
Cherrywood-smoked bacon has a milder flavor. If you want only a slight bacon flavor, like in a soup, try cherrywood-smoked bacon.
Applewood-smoked bacon has a subtle, fruity taste. It could make a great addition to a sweeter dish.

, Bacon is usually made from a pig, but there are other varieties. Bacon can also be made from a duck, beef, and lamb.Duck bacon has less fat than regular bacon, so if you're health conscious it may be a great choice. If you like duck meat, try duck bacon.
Beef bacon is similar to pastrami. It tastes similar to regular bacon, but with a beefier taste. It also tends to be juicier.
Lamb bacon has a rich flavor. If you enjoy dishes made from lamb, you may prefer lamb bacon.

, Canadian bacon is a fully cooked pork loin. It is more like ham than bacon. Typically, Canadian bacon is used on eggs benedict. If you're making eggs benedict, go for Canadian bacon., Pancetta is cured pork belly. It resembles American bacon but it is not smoked. It is rolled into a spiral and then sliced for cooking. It can work well as an addition to a salad or to a pasta. This is because it maintains its shape better than regular bacon., If you're vegetarian, or catering to someone who is, there are many varieties of vegetarian bacon. You can stop by your local supermarket and browse the vegetarian section to find veggie bacon.Tempeh is a substance made of fermented soy. Tempeh bacon is soaked in spices to get a similar taste to bacon. This can be a great meat substitute in dishes.

, In general, less ingredients will yield a higher quality bacon. A bacon packed with artificial flavors and preservatives may shrink more during the cooking process, leaving you with small strips of bacon to eat. It may also not taste as good as bacon made from more natural ingredients.In general, the ingredients list should not contain more than pork, salt, brown sugar, and water.
Bacon that has a lot of other ingredients is probably packed with artificial flavoring and preservatives. You may notice words that are long and difficult to pronounce.

, Nitrates are compounds that are found naturally in foods like vegetables. They are sometimes added to processed foods, such as bacon, as preservatives. While it's unclear whether nitrates as an additive are harmful, nitrate-free bacon generally uses less artificial ingredients. It's a good idea to see if you can find bacon free of nitrates.Keep in mind, the nitrate-free label is not entirely true. All bacon has nitrates. Nitrate-free bacon is made from celery rather than sodium-nitrate. Celery nitrates are more naturally occurring. As it's unclear if natural nitrates are better for you, it's debatable whether nitrate-free bacon is worth the extra cost. However, the label ""nitrate-free"" may help you locate bacon with less artificial flavoring.
The nitrates in well done bacon may be worse for your health than in medium done bacon. You can counteract the effects of nitrate with vitamin C. If you like bacon well-done, make the extra effort to find nitrate-free bacon. Also, have some fruit or a glass of orange juice after eating your bacon.

, If you want to support local farmers, locally sourced bacon may be the way to go. In addition to helping local farmers, it is also likely to be free of added ingredients. If you're concerned about ethical farming, many local farmers practice more humane treatments than are used on factory farms.You can go to a local farmer's market. You are likely to find naturally sourced bacon there.
You can also visit a local food co-op. Many co-ops work with local farmers, so you're likely to find nitrate-free bacon at a co-op.

, Uncured bacon is not real. All bacon is cured, and the uncured label merely means bacon was cured with more natural ingredients. Uncured bacon may be a good idea if you want a more natural taste. However, companies often use the label to convince consumers to pay more than necessary. Check the ingredients list if you see uncured bacon. Make sure the bacon actually uses less artificial flavoring and preservatives than other varieties., It is hard to determine the exact temperature at which to cook bacon, as bacon varies in thickness and quality. In general, however, you should always cook bacon until it's fully browned. Partially cooked bacon is not safe for consumption.Keep an eye on bacon while it's cooking. It should be crisp overall, and the color should have darkened some. Do not eat bacon until it's reached this state. Sometimes, cured meats retain some pinkness during cooking. This does not mean your bacon is not done. If it's crisp to the touch, and the color has darkened, it is usually safe to eat.
Avoid eating spoiled bacon. Most raw bacon will last 7 days in the refrigerator. Canadian bacon will only last 3 to 4 days. Leftover bacon lasts 4 to 5 days.

Freeze papaya.",How to Buy a Ripe Papaya," The skin of a ripe papaya ranges from yellow to orange-red. A few green spots are fine, especially since the papaya will ripen rapidly at home., Press the papaya gently with your fingertips. If the fruit is ripe, your fingers should sink slightly into it, similar to a ripe avocado.A hard papaya is not ripe. A papaya with mushy spots or shriveled areas is overripe,


Avoid papayas with soft flesh near the stem end., Look at the base of the papaya, where the stem was attached. If you see any mold or mildew, do not buy this papaya., Look for a papaya that has a faint, sweet scent near the stem.Avoid papayas with no smell, which are unripe. Avoid papayas with an unpleasant or strong smell, which may be old or fermented., Keep ripe papayas in the refrigerator to slow further ripening. While they may last up to a week, they are tastiest when eaten within a day or two., If your papayas are a little green, finish ripening them at room temperature. They should ripen within a few days. Here are two ways to speed it up and avoid mushy spots:Leave them on a flat surface, with space in between fruits. Keep out of direct sun. Rotate occasionally.
Keep them in a paper bag in a cool, dark location. Optionally, add a banana, apple, or avocado to hasten ripening.

, A completely green papaya may not ripen off the tree. But if you have no other options, you can give it a try. Score your green papaya with a sharp knife, drawing three lines from tip to tip.Make sure the knife penetrates the skin and lightly scores the flesh underneath. Leave at room temperature to ripen within a few days.


Alternatively, use your green papaya for recipes such as green papaya salad.

, If you have more papaya than you know what to do with, freeze the extras. Follow this method exactly to minimize mushiness and flavor loss:Peel a ripe papaya. Chop off and discard the stem end.
Cut in half and remove seeds.
Slice the papaya and space them out on a baking sheet. Freeze for an hour or two.
Transfer frozen slices to a sealed container and return to freezer.
Alternatively, puree the papaya, freeze the liquid in ice cube trays, and transfer to larger container.

Buy in bulk:


When shopping for natural and organic foods, buying in bulk can save you a lot of time and money.,
Attend farmers' markets:


Farmers' markets offer locally grown produce and other natural foods at a lower price, because you're buying directly from the distributor, in this case the farmer.,
Join a co-op:


These member-owned organizations offer discounts to participants.,
Purchase a community-supported agriculture (CSA) share:


Farmers who grow organic products work with distributors or as a distributor and assemble produce boxes with seasonal produce for pickup or delivery to consumers.,
Buy in-season:


Organic produce that is in season often costs less money, because there is so much more product.,
Purchase store brands:


Many large-chain grocery stores have store brands that offer natural and organic products.,
Look for the natural food aisle at your local grocery store:


Many stores nationwide have entire sections with natural and organic products.

,
Buy food online.,
Read labels:


When you're buying processed food like cereals, bread, frozen meals and more be sure to read the label.",How to Buy Natural Food,"
Products like grains, seeds and nuts are often far cheaper when
you're buying them in bulk.
Make sure you calculate the savings on other products.;
,
Talking to the farmer. You may be able to get a lower price if you buy in bulk or plan on buying from him or her on a consistent basis.

, Co-ops are stocked with a wide variety of natural, organic and local foods.
In addition, many co-ops have hot natural food prepared that you can get for lunch or bring home for dinner.

,
You pay a fee up front for the growing season and often a small fee on a weekly or monthly basis.
Prices are generally far less than buying from a grocery store. Consumers receive a box on a weekly basis filled with whatever produce the farmer has harvested that week.

,
For example, if it's strawberry season it might benefit you to buy a large quantity at a lower price and freeze the excess.

,
The money you'll save from not buying a mainstream brand is sometimes dramatic.

,,


Many online stores and distributors are making natural dried foods available for purchase.
You often end up paying less if it is in bulk and, depending on where you purchase the products from, you may not have to pay sales tax. An online search should yield many results.

,
When a product is labeled ""natural"" it doesn't necessarily mean it is free from pesticides and preservatives.
Be sure you're buying foods that have a short list of ingredients.
In general, the more ingredients on the list, the more chemicals and other unnatural ingredients the product has. Look for organic ingredients to be sure you're buying quality food.

Look for signs of decay.,
Check the rind color and webbing.,
Examine the stem end carefully.,
Heft and tap the cantaloupe.,
Feel and smell the blossom end.,
Store cantaloupe in the refrigerator.,
Wash hands when handling cantaloupe.,
Scrub the melon before cutting.,
Cut the melon.,
Peel and store leftovers.",How to Buy a Cantaloupe," Take a look at the bin, shelf, or box the cantaloupes are being stored in. If there are flies or other insects around it, or there is juice leaking out and covering the fruits, it's probably a good idea to buy your melon elsewhere.


Avoid melons with punctures, dents, or brown or black patches.
If there's only one patch of discoloration, this is probably where the melon rested on the ground, or where it was sunburned. This will usually not affect the taste.;
, A ripe cantaloupe has a yellow, tan, or cream-colored rind. This is covered with a webbed pattern, which has some areas that are more pronounced and raised off the surface.A grey-green rind covered by a flat web means the cantaloupe is unripe.Some newer varieties may stay green even when ripe.If every cantaloupe in the pile is green, try looking up the variety name online or asking a store employee.

, Never buy a cantaloupe with a rough or torn end, a lumpy end protruding from the fruit, or one that has nubs of stem still attached. These were picked too early, and will have poor flavor. Instead, look for a melon with a smooth, round ""belly button"" depression at one end instead.Although you can feel this end for the slight give that indicates ripeness, this is an unreliable test and can cause bruising. Do avoid melons with a wet, leaking end.

, The melon should be heavy for its size. It should be firm, but not rock hard. Tap it and listen for a low, solid sound. A high, hollow sound is a bad sign.Stay alert for signs of an overripe melon: a sticky surface, damp patches or bruises, or a sloshing sound when moved., A little give at the blossom end (opposite the stem end) is ideal.More importantly, it should have a pleasant, sweet smell, akin to flowers. An overpowering sweetness may mean the fruit is overripe and fermented.


The smell of alcohol or acetone (nail polish remover) means the melon is very fermented.
To avoid getting a melon with a mushy interior, press it gently all over. Is it firm? If you feel any soft spots or dimples, it will be mushy.

, The cold temperature will reduce the chance of bacterial growth, and keep the melon crisp. Keep the melon between 36 and 40ºF (2.2–5ºC) for best results.(Most likely, the crisper drawer of your refrigerator already falls in this range.)


You may store an unripe melon for a couple days at room temperature. Once ripe, refrigeration is highly recommended for health reasons.
The strong smell can cling to other items in the refrigerator. Store the melon in a closed glass or plastic container to prevent this., There have been several outbreaks of Salmonella and other bacteria from cantaloupes, partly because consumers are not aware they should be cautious.Wash your hands with soapy water after transporting your cantaloupe home. Wash your hands again before and after cutting the melon.

, The melon rind often contains bacteria that may be pushed onto the fruit by the knife. The webbed pattern can make it difficult to wash off the bacteria, so rub it thoroughly with a clean brush or your fingers instead. Hold the melon under running water as you do this.Pat it dry with paper towels when finished.


Do not wash the melon in advance. Even a little moisture and softened rind can lead to mold growth.
Do not use soap, which the melon can absorb through the rind.

, Use a clean knife and cutting board. Cut in half from the blossom end to the stem end, scrape out the seeds, then cut into slices.Wash all knives and surfaces once you're done enjoying the cantaloupe.

, Do not leave cut cantaloupe out for more than four hours; some guidelines recommend no more than two.Cut the flesh away from the peel and store covered in the refrigerator.Alternatively, freeze cantaloupe flesh in between layers of wax paper. For best flavor, serve within one month, partially thawed. To preserve flavor and color longer, cover in sugar or sugar syrup before freezing."

Find a place to buy coconuts.,
Choose a coconut that is heavy and full.,
Examine the eyes of the coconut for wetness and mold.,
Drain the water from your coconut, if you want to.,
Break the coconut open with a hammer.,
Take the coconut meat off of the shell with a knife.,
Store your coconut.",How to Buy and Store Coconut1," This might be at a grocery store near you with a great produce section, or perhaps you know of a coconut tree nearby. Make sure that you have a good selection of coconuts to choose from.


Although the best coconut season is from October to December, coconuts are being harvested all year long.;
, Pick up a few different coconuts from the pile you’re choosing from. When you pick a coconut, you should pick one that doesn’t have any cracks in it and feels heavy and full. Put it up to your ear and shake it. It should sound like there’s water in it.A browner coconut will have more white meat on the inside, while a green coconut will be filled with more electrolyte-filled juice. Browner coconuts are older, and greener ones are younger., On every coconut there are three “eyes,” or black spots. If these are moldy or not completely dry, avoid that coconut., You might want to keep your coconut unopened for a while, but if you want to open your coconut, you should first drain the coconut water from it. Find a long hard object, such as a skewer or a screwdriver, and stick it in one of the holes in the coconut. One will usually be softer than the others. Stick the skewer all the way through the coconut and make a hole in the coconut.You can also use a corkscrew, if you have one, to open it like you would open a bottle of wine.Put the coconut upside down and drain the water. You can drink this water or store it., Wrap the coconut in a towel. Hit it with a mallet or a hammer until it breaks. Split it apart into the amount of pieces that you want. Rinse off the coconut., If desired, use a knife with a rounded tip, such as a paring knife, to make an inverted V, about an inch long, into the meat of the coconut. This inverted V shape should allow you to pop that triangle of coconut meat out of the shell. Repeat this process until you’ve taken out all the meat., If you want to store your whole coconut, you can keep it at room temperature for about a week, in the refrigerator for 2-3 weeks, and in the freezer for 6-8 months. If you take the meat off of the coconut or open it, you should eat it the same day, put it in the fridge for a week, or keep it in the fridge for 6-8 months.Put it in an airtight container. Chill the coconut water in the refrigerator. Drink it as soon as possible.However, if the outside of the coconut turns grey or the meat inside turns a yellowish color, the coconut is expired and should not be eaten.If coconut water smells sour and tastes bad, you should throw it away immediately."

Read the ingredients list.,
Look for a peanut butter that is low in sodium.,
Find a peanut butter that's low in sugar.,
Avoid low-fat or reduced fat options.",How to Buy Healthy Peanut Butter1," Many popular brands include unhealthy ingredients and chemicals such as corn syrup, hydrogenated vegetable oil, mono- and di-glycerides, soy protein concentrate, maltodextrin, and soy lecithin. Pure peanut butter is made of roasted peanuts and doesn't require additional ingredients. Look for brands that exclusively use roasted peanuts in the ingredients list.Brands like Skippy, Planters, and Great Value contain additional sugar and additives.
Maltodextrin is a caloric sweetener made from rice, potatoes, or cornstarch and can raise blood glucose and insulin levels.
Monoglycerides and diglycerides are food additives used to prevent the oil from separating out of peanut butter. This means it is natural and normal to see the oil on top of peanut butter that does not have this additive.;
, While an all-natural peanut butter can be healthier than one that has chemical additives, different peanut butter brands have a different sodium content. Sodium is an ingredient that's found in healthy peanut butter but should be taken into consideration, especially for those with conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure.Peanut butter typically ranges from 40 mg to 250 mg of sodium per serving of 2 tablespoons., No sugar is required to make peanut butter, but brands typically add it to enhance its flavor. Look for natural ingredients and sweeteners like honey, cane syrup, or agave nectar. Avoid artificial sweeteners like aspartame.If you can't find a peanut butter that uses natural sugars, then find one that's low in sugar.


Peanut butter typically contains one to four grams of sugar per serving.Special peanut butter like Peanut Butter & Co. Cinnamon Raisin Swirl and Sunland Natural Peanut Butter Creamy Chocolate Spread can contain up to 9 grams of sugar., While the idea of reduced saturated fat sounds like a healthy option, it's typically coupled with a ton of unnatural chemicals and additives. Pay attention to brands that tout to be low or reduced fat variations.

Locate a local butcher or meat market in your area that cuts standing rib roast to order.,
Determine how many ribs you will need to feed your diners.,
Ask specifically for prime-grade meat.,
Request the butcher precut the roast for you by slicing off the ""chine bones,"" which are located at the bottom of the roast.,
Ask the butcher to trim the bones if they are longer than 7 to 8 inches (17.8 to 20.3 cm).,
Inspect the roast once the butcher has cut it for you.",How to Buy a Standing Rib Roast," Standing rib roasts are expensive in relation to other meats, and because of this, you should be selective about your purchase. Avoid purchasing a precut or prepackaged roast.
, Most butchers recommend one rib portion for every two diners. As an example, if you have six diners, three ribs should be sufficient, and for 10 diners, you would need five ribs. Inform your butcher of how many ribs you will need when ordering., This may require the butcher to place a special order to get it, but if you don't demand prime grade, you could wind up getting ""beef bone in roast,"" which is generally priced the same but a lower quality of cut. If you're going to pay for an elite cut of beef, make sure you're getting your money's worth., Also, request the meat be cut away from the rib bones but placed back on top of the bones before packing. This pre-cutting will make carving the finished meat much easier., Shorter ribs will make it easier to place the roast in the oven to cook., The meat should be vibrant red, and be free from browned or dried-out edges, which are sure indicators the cut is old. Before leaving the store, be sure the packaging of the roast is airtight and sealed to maintain optimal freshness of the roast until you are ready to cook it."

Look for organic brands.,
Taste test various healthy brands.,
Find grocery store chains that carry a variety of peanut butter.",How to Buy Healthy Peanut Butter2," Organic peanut butter brands are typically healthier and don't contain harmful GMOs or other added chemicals. Peanuts that grow organically are free of pesticides.Look for brands that say organic on the front or have organic in the name of the peanut butter.


Popular organic brands include Peanut Butter & Company: Smooth Operator, Everyday Value, 365 Organic Unsweetened, and Trader Joe's Organic.

, To find a healthy brand of peanut butter that you can actually enjoy, you should taste test all the major brands that you've evaluated to be healthy. Once you determine a brand that you enjoy, you'll have an idea of what kind of healthy peanut butter you like best. Determine whether you like chunky or smooth peanut butter and seek healthy variations that suit your tastes., Stores like Wholefoods or Trader Joe's may have a greater variety of healthy or organic peanut butter. Other large chains may also have variations, but will also often carry the unhealthy versions that are packed with chemical additives. Health food grocery chains have their own brands which are often all natural.

Try walnut butter.",How to Buy Healthy Peanut Butter3," Almonds are the most nutritionally dense nut and contain potassium, calcium, vitamin E, magnesium, phosphorous, and iron. While some nut butters do contain a significant amount of fat per serving, they are typically the more healthful fats that lower LDL cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease. They can lead to decreased obesity because they keep you feeling full longer.Almond butter is said to be drier than peanut butter, so choose different brands until you find one you can enjoy.Popular almond butter brands include Kevala and Barney Butter., While cashew butter does not contain the high levels of protein found in peanut butter, it does contain essential vitamins and nutrients such as iron, magnesium, zinc, copper, phosphorous, and manganese. Also, cashew butter may also reduce triglyceride levels which will improve can improve health, especially for people with diabetes.Artisana Raw Organic is a healthy, organic, cashew butter., Sunflower seed butter unsurprisingly tastes like sunflower seeds, but can also be healthy for you.Sunflower seed butter is packed with magnesium and antioxidants like vitamin E., Soy nut butter is made from roasted soybeans and mixed with soybean oil.

Pay attention to the avocadoes’ color.,
Squeeze the avocados.,
Check the avocadoes’ skin.,
Examine the avocados’ stems.,
Select an avocado based on your flavor preference.,
Choose an avocado based on its peeling characteristics.,
Buy an avocado based on its oil content.,
Keep unripened avocados in a paper bag.,
Store whole, ripe avocados in the refrigerator.,
Sprinkle cut ripe avocados with lemon juice before refrigerating.",How to Buy a Good Avocado," The first thing that you’ll probably notice about avocados at a store is their color. Ripe avocados are typically a dark, almost black color with hints of green when they’re ripe. If you want to use the avocado as soon as you get home, choose one that is dark. If you plan to use one in a couple of days, select one that’s more green.Some varieties of avocado such as the Fuerte, Ettinger, Reed, and Sharwill  stay green when they are ripe, so it’s important to know the type of avocado that you’re looking at.
Keep in mind that color isn’t the only factor that you should consider when looking for a ripe avocado. Always test it by touch too.;
, If an avocado looks ripe, you should still feel it to test its ripeness. Hold it in the palm of your hand, and squeeze gently. A ripe avocado should yield to firm, gentle pressure, but shouldn’t feel overly soft or mushy.If an avocado feels firm or hard, it isn’t ripe yet. Purchase it only if you plan to use the fruit several days in the future.
If an avocado feels soft, it’s overripe so you should avoid it.
The harder that an avocado is, the longer that it will likely take for it to ripen.
If you’re purchasing several avocados, it’s a good idea to choose them at various stages of ripeness. That way, you’ll have some that you can use right way, some that you can use in a couple of days, and some that you can use four or five days in the future.

, In addition to the color of the avocado’s skin, you should examine its texture. The skin should be slightly pebbled, but make sure that there are no large indentations that may indicate the fruit’s been bruised., To ensure that the avocado you’re choosing is ripe and creamy on the inside, peel back the small stem or cap at the top. If the area underneath is green, the avocado is good to buy. If the area is brown, the avocado is overripe so it’s best to avoid it.When you’re checking the stem area, keep an eye out for mold as well. If the area is black or dark brown, the fruit is likely moldy.

, While all avocados have a similar taste, there are subtle differences in their flavor that may make you prefer one over another. Some have a nutty flavor, while others have a lighter taste. Choose an avocado based on what flavor will work best for your recipe or use.Hass, Lamb Hass, Gwen, Reed, or Sharwil avocados have a creamy, nutty flavor.
Bacon and Zutano have a lighter taste.

, Some avocadoes are easy to peel, while others require a little more effort to remove the skin. If you’re in a hurry, purchase avocados that are easier to peel to save yourself some time. If you don’t mind putting a little more work into peeling the fruit, you can opt for any variety.Pinkerton avocados are the easiest to peel, but Bacon, Fuerte, Hass, and Gwen don’t pose many difficulties either.
Zutano avocados are moderately easy to peel.
Ettinger avocados are the most difficult type to peel.

, Some varieties of avocado have more oil in them than others, which means they have a higher fat content. If you want to maintain a healthy low-fat diet, choose a variety that has a lower oil content.Avocados with the highest oil content are the Hass, Pinkerton, Sharwil and Fuerte varieties.

, If you purchase an avocado that hasn’t ripened yet, you can leave it out on your counter to ripen in four to five days. To help the fruit ripen more quickly, place it in a brown paper bag with an apple or banana, which release ethylene gas that helps the avocado ripen in two to three days.Keep the paper bag with the avocados out of direct sunlight to ensure that they don’t become overripe.
When you remove the avocados from the bag, test their ripeness by pressing against the skin lightly. It should be tender but not mushy.

, If you bring ripe avocados home from the grocery store or ripen them in a paper bag but don’t plan to use them right away, leave them intact and uncut. Store them in the refrigerator for up to three days.Because the cold slows down the ripening process, you should never store unripe avocados in the refrigerator.

, If you eat or use half of a ripe avocado and don’t plant to finish the rest, you should store it in the refrigerator. However, it’s important to squeeze a fresh lemon or lime over it to stop it from browning. Seal it in plastic wrap or an airtight plastic container, and keep it in the fridge for no more than a day.You’ll have a better chance of keeping the avocado from browning if you leave the pit in it when you cut it.

Understand that the key elements of a root cellar have to do with temperature, humidity and ventilation.,
Think out of the box for your underground root cellar.,
Cover either of the above choices with 1 foot (30.48) of dirt or other coverage for temporary fall storage.

,
Locate your root cellar in an area that has good drainage away from it.,
Excavate for the root cellar so that, when the walls are buried, you have at least 4 feet (1.22 meters) of coverage.,
Vent the cellar by installing two PVC pipes.,
Create an entry to the root cellar.,
Cover the floor of your root cellar with gravel or even a concrete floor.,
Choose wooden shelves over metal.,
Place a temperature and humidity gauge in the cellar and keep a record of the readings.",How to Build an Underground Root Cellar," Keep these three details in mind and the cellar can be built using just about any method.


Building material options include native stone, concrete cinder blocks, earth-packed tires or cedar logs for walk-in root cellars. The most common of these is to use concrete cinder blocks. This material is readily available from a DIY store.;
,


Use a fiberglass water tank. These will be easy to modify and bury.






Bury a 50 gallon (189.3 L) plastic drum in the ground.







,, Ideally, this would be on a hill side facing north and limiting exposure to the opening of the cellar.

, Ten feet (3.05 meters) is even better.

, One pipe must enter the root cellar low to the floor to let cool air in, and the other one needs to be near the ceiling to vent out hot air.


The vent pipes will need to be screened to keep out pests and to protect the produce from weather that is too cool or too warm. Remember, cool air settles and warm air rises.






Ventilation is also important to remove ethylene gases that fruit and vegetables produce as they ripen. Venting ethylene gases slows down the ripening process.







,


The door to the root cellar plays a double roll -- to keep the varmints and unwanted visitors out and to keep the cool air in.






Most root cellars have 1 door at the surface and a second at the wall that opens to the root cellar (if this exists). This entry way acts as a little extra insulation in the form of dead space to keep the cool air in.







, Either one can be wet down to help raise the humidity when you need it.

, Metal transmits heat, warming up faster that wood. Wood helps you keep the temperature more in control as a result.

, This will help you to track how effective these numbers are and reflect the best way to maintain your root cellar.

Thoroughly wash all produce.,
Dry and wipe down produce.,
Peel off outer layers of produce.,
Discard the fat and skin in meats.,
Purchase 100% organic foods.,
Do not purchase foods known to have high levels of glyphosate.,
Avoid foreign produce.,
Consider growing some of your own food.,
Eat a varied diet.,
Stay up-to-date with recent news and research.,
Look for organic labeling.,
Read the ingredient list.,
Purchase cost-effective organic products.",How to Avoid Glyphosate Residue," Glyphosate residues are found on and in many foods. However, common sources of this harmful chemical are fruits and vegetables. Thoroughly washing these items can help reduce how much glyphosate and other pesticides you ingest.Food safety specialists recommend using plain water or an organic produce cleanser (which you can buy at your local grocery store) to wash produce. Rinse for a few seconds and all visible dirt has been washed away.
Regardless of whether or not you've purchased organic produce, it's still important to wash each piece before consumption.
Never use dish soap or hand soap to wash your produce. These soaps can get absorbed by the porous nature of some fruits and vegetables.
No washing method is 100% effective at removing all pesticide residues. Some pesticides, like glyphosate, penetrate into the plant and fruit itself which unfortunately, cannot be removed by washing.Also wash down any utensils or dishware that held the fruit or vegetables prior to washing.;
, In addition to washing fruits and vegetables, it's also important to dry them appropriately. Even after washing, if items are not wiped down, pesticide residue may still remain.Use a clean dish cloth or paper towel to wipe and dry all fruits and vegetables that you have washed. This helps remove any pesticide residue still remaining on your food items.
If you're washing multiple items, consider using paper towels. Throw them away between each fruit or vegetable to prevent re-contamination between items.
Even fruits and vegetables that have an inedible outer layer or skin (like bananas or melons) should be washed and wiped down. You can still transfer the pesticide residue into the flesh of the item when cutting or preparing them.

, Another good method of reducing pesticide residues like glyphosate residue is by peeling off and removing outer layers of certain types of produce.


Items like lettuce, cabbage, artichokes, leeks or brussels sprouts have many layers of leaves. Removing the outer most layers (especially if they seem dirty) can help reduce the level of glyphosate and other pesticides that you're consuming.
Remove leaves of even organic items as well. Take off enough of the outer layers until you've reach lighter green or lighter colored leaves towards the center of your item.
In addition, make sure to peel outer layers of other fruits and vegetables. The outermost layer of items like asparagus, potatoes, carrots, celery and turnips should be peeled off so you're not consuming parts of the vegetable that have come into contact with soil or sprayed pesticides.

, Many people might forget the outside layers of foods other than fruits and vegetables may also contain higher levels of glyphosate and other pesticide residues. Remove the skins of your protein sources as well.Glyphosate is such a tricky pesticide to avoid because it's not only used to spray on crops, but some of those same crops are fed to animals as feed. The residue then ends up in the animal flesh - especially the fatty tissue like skin.If you purchase meat or poultry make sure to trim away excess fat or purchase leaner cuts of meat.
For poultry remove the skin or purchase poultry without the skin. Also trim excess fat if it's visible.

, One fairly easy way to cut out the glyphosate and other pesticide residue from your foods is to purchase organic items. Labeling laws require these foods to fit a certain description especially in regards to pesticide use.Definitely choose to purchase 100% organic fruits and vegetables. Many pesticides are used to grow fruits and vegetables so choosing organic foods will automatically reduce the quantity of pesticide residues.
Also buy 100% organic meats and poultry. Even though pesticides are not used on animals, it is used on their feed (like corn or soy plants). This allows pesticides to get into the meat and skin of the animal.
It might also be wise to purchase 100% organic grains (like wheat or quinoa) as some of these plants have also been implicated in having higher levels of glyphosate residues.

, There are many different pesticides available and are frequently used on the food supply. However, there is a very specific set of foods that contain higher levels of glyphosate.Specifically avoid the following items as they contain overly high residue amounts:


Soy (this means soy products and soy or vegetable oil)
Corn and corn oil
Canola seeds used in canola oil
Beets and beet sugar
Almonds
Dried peas
Carrots
Quinoa
Sweat potatoes

, During the colder months in the US, many sources of produce come from outside the country. Although this allows us to have a wide variety of fruits and vegetables available, you might end up consuming higher quantities of pesticide residues.


For starters, other countries follow different sets of guidelines when it comes to pesticide use and acceptable or tolerable levels. They may allow a higher residue level compared to the US.Always look for the Country of Origin label on your produce. It'll say where the item was originally grown.
You can always stick to local farmers markets or purchasing foods that are advertised as locally grown.

, Many people are considering that in addition to purchasing organic products, they should grow some of their own foods. This helps you know exactly what types of food you're growing (for example, whether it's an heirloom variety plant or a GMO plant) and allows to you use no pesticides whatsoever.


If you have the space, consider starting a small garden. Make sure you choose a spot with plenty of sunlight. Plant vegetables or fruits that you eat frequently or are known to be higher in pesticides (like celery or strawberries).
If you do not have a backyard or a large amount of space, consider doing container gardening. Many fruit and vegetable plants do well in containers as long as they get decent sunlight and are watered regularly.

, You might be surprised that a varied diet can help cut down on how much glyphosate residue and other pesticide residues you consume. However, this is a good trick to keep in mind to reduce your exposure risk.


Although glyphosate is used on many, many types of crops (as are other pesticides), many farmers stick to one type of pesticide per crop.
For example, they may use Roundup (that contains the glyphosate) on their corn but use a completely different pesticide on their fruit trees.
Having a varied diet reduces your chance of being over exposed to a singular type of pesticide.In addition, it gives you a wider range of nutrients and helps you maintain a well-balanced diet.

, If you're trying to avoid pesticides, especially those that are harmful like glyphosate, it's important to stay update with new and emerging research on these chemicals.


The FDA, EPA and other organizations regularly update consumers on where these pesticides are found, what foods contain the highest levels and how you can minimize your risk of ingesting them.
One particularly good resource to use is the National Pesticide Information Center. They have information and research on all pesticides used in the US.
You can sign up for email alerts or regularly check these websites for information regarding pesticide and glyphosate use.

, Purchasing organic foods is the first line of defense for minimizing those harmful pesticides like glyphosate residue. However, be a careful and informed consumer while you're looking for these options at the grocery store.


There are two different types of organic labeling. You can either purchase organic foods or 100% organic foods. There are differences between the two that you should be aware of. Ideally, you should only purchase 100% organic foods.When you see the 100% organic label, that means the food and all of its components have met the USDA's organic labeling laws. If it's only labeled as organic, that means that only 95% of the food or its ingredients need to be organic.
Although you may see other types of labeling, like ""all natural"", only choose foods that are 100% organic. ""All natural"" does not have any legal definition and these items could still contain conventional foods or those that contain pesticides.

, When looking at foods and reviewing the label, its important to also review the ingredient list. This is particularly important when trying to avoid glyphosate residues.


Unfortunately the pesticide Roundup which contains the glyphosate is used on many different crops. These crops are not always eaten ""as is."" They made be used for oils, used to make other foods (like bread) or used in animal feed.
Being familiar with the items that contain glyphosate can help you pick them out from an ingredient list so you can avoid purchasing foods that are made with ingredients that are contaminated.
Common ingredients that could have higher levels of glyphosate residue are: canola oil, vegetable oil, soy oil, and corn products (like corn oil or corn starch).
Read over the entire ingredient list (posted near the nutrition fact panel) and look for any of these items. If they're listed as an ingredient, you may want to avoid this food.

, Many people do not want to buy organic foods because they can be significantly more expensive than conventional items. However, there are some tricks you can use to purchase all organic without paying more money.


Consider purchasing private label organic products. Many big chain grocery stores now offer their own brand of organic products. These are generally close to the same price as conventional brand name items.Another place you can find local and cheaper organic produce is the farmers market. Consider purchasing as many items as you can from your local farmer.
You may even want to consider switching your grocery store. There are so many different stores available that you may be able to find certain stores that specialize in organic foods and have a cheaper price tag.

After breaking up your powdered food, its ready to be blended/processed.


If your powdered food is less clumpy and more powdery, it may be difficult to transfer it to your blender/processor. In this case, use a funnel to prevent spilling good powder.
Use a tool, like a normal or wooden spoon, to guide your powdered food into the blender/processor from its container.;
, Reattach the lid of your blender or processor and fasten it tight. A poor lid seal could send your powdered food flying! Then you'll have to select the right blending/processing mode for your powder.


Powdered food that is very lumpy might benefit from a lower speed setting, first. On some blenders/processors, this might be indicated as the ""Stir"" function.
Your powdered food shouldn't require more than a short time at a medium speed to refine it back to its original, lumpless form.
It is generally recommended, when using a blender/processor, to keep a hand on its top when running to prevent it coming loose., You should prioritize a container that is airtight, as these will prevent opportunities for moisture cause more clumping. If you live in a humid climate or have regular issues with clumping, you might also want to store your powdered food in the freezer.The cold temperatures in your freezer will create a dry environment for your stored powdered food and reduce the formation of lumps., You can use your powdered food straight from the freezer. However, when baking, you may want to allow powdered ingredients to come to room temperature before using. Many times these recipes are created assuming all ingredients are at their normal temperature (e.g. - refrigerator cold milk/eggs, room temp sugar/flour, etc.).


The temperature of the ingredients you use can influence the outcome of your recipe. If you're concerned the temperature of your powdered food might affect the outcome, it may be best to allow your ingredients to sit until they are room temperature."

Sift loose bits into the container and use a clean, dry tool, like a wooden spoon, to push lumps against and through the mesh of your strainer.Try not to be too forceful when pushing lumps through the strainer. This could cause damage to the strainer.
Some lumps may not break apart easily. In many cases, these will be unsalvageable and can be thrown away.
Tiny lumps that are small enough to fit through the spaces of your sturdy strainer may remain in the mixture. This is ok.
You may need to sift with your sturdy strainer a few times before your powdered food becomes consistent throughout. When you reach this point, you're ready to move on.

, Take a fine mesh strainer and position it over a clean, dry container. Pour your powdered food a little bit at a time into the strainer and sift loose powder into the container below. Then, using a tool like a wooden spoon, push remaining clumps through the fine mesh to break them apart.


Fine mesh strainers are usually a little more delicate than the thicker variety you used previously. Use light to moderate force to prevent breaking your strainer.
If you notice lumps that stubbornly resist breaking up in your strainer, you should remove these and throw them away.
You may need to strain your powdered food several times in your fine mesh strainer before it is consistent throughout and your lumps are broken up.
Depending on how find your mesh strainer is, you may have very small lumps remaining in your powdered food. In this case, you can repeat the process with an even finer mesh strainer until all lumps are gone.

, Moisture is the major culprit that causes most clumping and lumping in food powders, so you may want to use an airtight container. Your powdered food is now ready for use."

Read the use-by dates.,
Store items correctly.,
Make it easy to find your food.,
Use containers to prolong the freshness of foods.",How to Keep Food Fresh in the Kitchen," Buying larger quantities of food that you don't eat quickly is not usually good economy and you risk losing the food to spoilage if not used in time. With the exception of items eaten quickly in your household, only purchase small quantities of perishable food and refresh as needed.;
, Make sure that when you buy a new food item, you pull the unfinished one forward in the pantry cupboard or refrigerator so that the older item is finished first. Every now and then do a sweep of the food to bring forward all items that are getting near their use-by date.

, These items lose their flavour over time and the use-by date is there for a reason. Only purchase new ones when you are going to use them.

, Resist the temptation to not eat or use them in cooking or you may end up finding you waited too long. Enjoy them quickly so that you make the most of them. Don't let such items get stuck at the back of the fridge!

, Food stored next to the oven will deteriorate more quickly than food kept in a cooler environment. Move your food items that are stored next to the oven if necessary.

, Read them even before you buy and look for the freshest item to bring home. Once home, always be very careful to use refrigerated and frozen foods by their use-by date. Expired use-by dates on pantry items are often less urgent within a short period of time but remember that even food in tins and dried food loses its taste and appeal with too much storage.

, Maintaining freshness is dependent on knowing how the food should be stored. For many items, you can find the information on the packaging. There are also numerous articles on wikiHow about storing fruit, vegetables, meat etc. Freezers often indicate on the door how food should be stored. Following the food storage guidelines will help to prolong the freshness of your food.

, Pantries and food cupboards should be well lit; refrigerators and freezers should not be crammed so full that you can't bear to rummage in them. Use shelves, rolling wire storage drawers and other helpful storage elements to make arranging food at eye level possible. A small outlay on good kitchen storage can pay its way in less spoiled food.

, Plastic, glass and tin containers all work well and can be purchased in a wide variety of shapes and sizes suited to your needs.

Add a moisture absorber to your mix.,
Sift your powdered food regularly.,
Avoid applying powder over pans of hot food.",How to Break Up Lumps in Stored Powdered Food3," As moisture causes most lumping in your powdered food, adding a moisture absorber, like dried rice or beans, to your mix prevents lumps from ever happening. Rice and beans are also relatively large, which means they'll be easy to pick out or can be caught easily in a shaker or strainer and separated from your food powder.


While rice and beans are common moisture absorbers, many other things might be used, like unpopped popcorn., You don't have to wait until lumps have formed to start sifting. Sifting aerates your food powder, releasing moisture that may be trapped inside it. Sifting your powdered food monthly and returning it to a clean, dry, airtight container will reduce occurrences of lumping.If your powdered food has not started lumping yet, simply passing it through a fine mesh strainer and into a fresh, dry, airtight container should help keep it lumpless.

, Cooking food in a pan usually gives off steam, and steam is a form of moisture in the air. This moisture can rise from your pan to your shaker/container and get trapped there, creating future lumps.


To prevent this from happening, you may want to first put your food powder in your hand or a spoon and then sprinkle it onto the food you are preparing."

If you want to keep brown sugar soft, you're best option is to store your brown sugar in a sealable, airtight container as soon as you open it up.Limit air exposure as much as possible when storing brown sugar. Choose a smaller container and pack the brown sugar to the top. Make sure to seal tightly, double checking for cracks and openings.You may not find a small enough container. In this case, use a small Ziplock bag. Squeeze out all the excess air before sealing the bag.;
, Kitchen shops and some grocery stores sell what are called terra cotta sugar savers. These are small, circular devices made from terra cotta clay. They are inexpensive, about $3 each, and can be easily used to soften brown sugar. They are designed to release moisture into your sugar, keeping it soft in storage.


After purchasing the terra cotta sugar saver, soak it in water for 15 minutes. Then, dry off the disk.Store the sugar saver with the brown sugar. Ideally, you should be using the terra cotta sugar saver alongside a sealable airtight container or plastic bag.If you add a sugar saver to a bag of brown sugar that's already hardened, it may take up to 8 hours for the sugar to soften., If you don't have a sugar saver, marshmallows work for some when it comes to keeping sugar soft. Throw a few marshmallows into your sugar container and see if it helps., Apples and bread are both fairly moist by nature. Adding a few slices of apples or a piece of bread to a bag of brown sugar can help keep it soft. The idea is the sugar will draw moisture from the bread or fruit. If you're adding apples or bread to hardened brown sugar, it may take a day before it begins to soften."

The simplest way to get it to soften is by adding water. Sprinkle a few drops of water over hardened brown sugar. Then, seal the sugar into a plastic bag. Set aside for a few days and it should soften considerably as the water makes its way through the sugar., You can also use a cloth to add moisture to brown sugar. Place your hardened brown sugar in an open container. Then, get a cloth or paper towel wet. Wring out until moist and set it over the container. Leave the sugar like this overnight. If this method is successful, your sugar should be soft by morning., You can also use tinfoil and paper towel to soften brown sugar. To start, put the hardened sugar in a sealable container.


Place a piece of tinfoil over the top of the hardened brown sugar. Then, get some paper towels damp and place them over the tinfoil.Seal the container. Let it sit long enough that the paper towel dries. This can happen overnight but may also take a few days. Once the towel is dry, the sugar should be softened."

Be careful bagging glass.,
Don't overpack your bags.,
Double-bag, when necessary.,
Consider what can be left unpacked.,
Be courteous.",How to Bag Groceries," Paper or cloth bags are great for most things, but plastic bags prevents spills from ending up all over your car, or you. If you have meats or other items that may leak, consider placing them in one of the plastic bags provided in the produce or meat sections.


In some counties in the United States, grocery stores have been made to charge for bags. If you have not brought your own bag, this can mean $0.10 per bag in addition to the cost of groceries.;
, By separating your bags into four groups--general pantry items, meats, frozen/refrigerated foods, and produce--you lower the chances for cross-contamination or damage.


Frozen items, such as ice cream and frozen veggies, should be grouped together with other perishables, such as dairy, to retain a cooler temperature. Grouping these items also makes it easier to unpack everything that should be put into the refrigerator or freezer immediately.
Separate uncooked and ready-to-eat meats to avoid the risk of salmonella poisoning or contamination. Place raw meats in separate plastic bags, as they have the tendency to leak.
Pack fruits, vegetables and other ready-to-eat items together and away from raw foods--especially meats--in order to prevent cross-contamination.Pack eggs separate from any foods you plan on eating raw, in case they crack.
Cleaning products and chemical items should be packed separately from any food items, so as to protect against contamination.

, Generally heavier, larger items should be packed first to create stability in the bag and so that they don't crush any smaller items beneath them.


Taller boxes, such as cereal boxes should go around the edges a bag to create a stable wall.
Cans and other squat, heavy items should go in the bottom middle of the bag.
Medium sized staples, such as boxes of oatmeal or bags of rice, should go in the middle on top of the cans.
Delicate items, like bread or eggs, lay on top of the medium sized staples.

, Packing glass items next to each other can cause cause them to clank and break. Place your glass in the middle of cans at the bottom of the bag. The cans will support the glass, minimizing the chance for breakage.


If you have paper sleeves available to you, you may wrap the glass and set them next to each other. The paper will act as a buffer protecting against breaks., Make sure your bags don't exceed 15 pounds. Distribute the heavy items among several bags, to prevent the bags from breaking.


For canned goods, limit the number of cans to about 6 to 8 per bag, depending on the can size. For items in glass jars, limit the number to about 4.
Know how much weight can be carried, and plan accordingly.

, Double-bagging either plastic or paper bags reinforces the bag and enables you to pack your bags with more and heavier items.

, Rolls of toilet paper, big sacks of dog food, or boxes of soda may not fit in bags. Most larger items can be carried out on their own, or with the addition of a quick and handy adhesive handle.

, When you have finished packing a customer's bag, thank them for their business and ask if they require any assistance to their car.


When you get to the car, observe the same packing rules you did for bagging: heavier bags on the bottom or around the sides, bags containing more delicate items on top, or supported in the middle.
Use caution when placing items in back seats next to child safety seats. Make sure nothing will tip over on to the child.

",How to Avoid Purchasing Toxic Fruits or Vegetables," Sometimes damaged fruits and vegetables will look just that—damaged. Examine your produce for spots, bruises, and mold both before you purchase and before you prepare it. More often than not, the damage is on the inside, but you should still make sure the outside looks safe before you slice it up.;
, What you can't tell from the exterior of a fruit or vegetable you often can tell simply by sniffing it. If it has any unusual odor, you definitely don't want to buy it.

, This mostly applies to pre-cut, pre-packaged produce like salad greens; the colder it is when you find it, the lower the chance of it being contaminated (since bacteria grow and multiply faster in warm areas). By this, you should also pick up your refrigerated items at the end of your shopping trip and put them into your fridge as soon as you get home to minimize risk.

, Again, this is pretty much only for bags of produce that can be labeled. Obviously if the date on the bag has already passed (or will pass before you plan on eating the food inside), you should nix it.

, When shopping you should always put your produce in individual bags to prevent cross-contamination (unwanted organisms or chemicals being spread from one food to another). This is especially critical if you're purchasing meat at the same time, because the bacteria on the meat that will presumably be killed when you cook it could easily get onto your fruits and vegetables that you won't be cooking.

, Rinse the produce when you bring it home, pat dry and refrigerate.

, Store each produce item separately. Your refrigerator should be kept at a temperature of 40 °F (4 °C) or below for all items; your freezer should be between 0° and −10 °F (−23 °C). If you are not sure whether you should be refrigerating something, go ahead and refrigerate it anyway. You should avoid freezing leafy greens and unprepared fruits, but if they do get too cold, you can always defrost them.

,, You might not realize that anything is wrong with your produce until you get home, but if you suspect that it is contaminated, do not hesitate to toss it. Even if you get all the way through the process of preparing the food and, when you bite into it, the taste is off, trust your instincts and spit it out. After all, better safe than sorry.

Choose a fresh fruit to ferment.,
Add the fruit.",How to Ferment Fruit," Fermentation is a process used to preserve foods and increase the level of good bacteria they contain. You shouldn't be intimidated by the fermentation process -- it is actually quite simple and straightforward!









Basically, fermentation involves placing your chosen fruit in a jar or other container and adding a combination of water, sugar and starter culture (such as yeast or whey).
The lid is then sealed and the fruit is left at room temperature for between 2 to 10 days. During this time, the starter culture will convert the sugar to alcohol, and carbon dioxide gas will be produced as a by-product, forming bubbles at the top of the jar.
Once fermented, the fruit will contain an abundance of beneficial bacteriaand can be used as a condiment, dessert topping, or in recipes for things like chutneys, smoothies and salsas.;
, Most fruits can be fermented, though some work better than others. Many people prefer to ferment canned or frozen fruits, as it reduces preparation time. If using fresh fruit, opt for ripe, organic produce with no bruises or blemishes.









Fruits like peaches, plums and apricots are a popular choice for fermenting, as they are tasty and hold their color well. Wash the fruit, peel the skin and remove any pits.
Exotic fruits like mangoes and pineapples ferment well and can be used to make chutney. Remove the skins and cut into even-sized cubes before using.
Grapes can be fermented, but they must be pricked with a needle or cut in half to allow the cultured liquid inside.
Peeled and sliced pears can be fermented, as can apples (though these tend to turn brown throughout the process, which some people find unappealing).
Most berries can be fermented, except for blackberries which contain too many seeds. Strawberries ferment well in terms of flavor, but the syrup tend to bleach their color.

, A starter culture is simply a substance that contains beneficial bacteria which is used to kickstart the fermentation process.









For most recipes, it's not necessary to use a specific starter culture -- they are pretty much interchangeable.
The most common starter cultures (especially for fermenting fruit as opposed to vegetables) are baking yeast, whey and special culture starter powders, such as Caldwell's starter.
However, you can also use an opened probiotic capsule, the liquid from a previously opened jar of fermented fruit or a fermented beverage such as plain kombucha tea.
To make a specific type of fermented fruit called Rumtoph (which is used in traditional German and Danish desserts) alcohol such as rum, wine, or brandy is used to encourage fermentation.

, Aside from the fruit, you can also add flavorings to the container to give the finished product more depth.









Some popular additions include: cinnamon sticks, fresh mint leaves, cloves, vanilla beans, whole allspice, orange peel and almond extract. Which ones you choose are simply a matter of personal preference.
You can add liquid flavorings or extracts to your fermenting fruit, but stay away from powdered spices -- these simply stick to the side of the container and ruin the appearance of the fruit. This is particularly imported if you intended to give jars of the fermented fruit as a gift.

, During the fermentation process, the container of fruit should be stored at room temperature, away from direct sunlight. Keep in mind that the unique conditions of your home will affect the success and speed of the fermentation process.









You can keep the fermenting fruit in the refrigerator during periods of very hot weather, but keep in mind that this will more or less halt the fermentation process.
Once the fruit has fermented fully, you should store it in the refrigerator, where it will keep for up to two months. If you like, you can replace the fruit as you go -- this will keep the fermentation process going indefinitely.
Keep in mind that fermented fruits should have a pleasantly sour taste, but they should not taste gone off or rotten. They should not be too mushy either -- fermented fruits should hold their original shape. So if you fruit looks mushy or smells bad, you should throw that batch out and start again. , Open the can, and drain the liquid from the fruit.








, Add equal amounts of sugar and drained, canned fruit to a loosely lidded jar and then add a package of baking yeast and stir to combine.









Stir until the sugar has dissolved (the moisture from the fruit will liquefy the sugar), add any flavorings, then loosely replace the lid of the jar.
Leave approximately an inch of space at the top of the jar, as the volume will expand as the fruit ferments.
The lid needs to be loose enough to allow the carbon dioxide gas to escape, but tight enough to prevent insects from getting inside.

, Fermentation occurs once bubbles appear on the fruit because the yeast is digesting the sugar and converting it into alcohol.









Fruit tends to ferment quickly, in 24 to 48 hours. However, some people prefer to ferment the fruit for up to 2 to 3 weeks. This allows it to develop a much stronger flavor, as the syrup is converted into alcohol.
The length of time you allow your fruit to ferment is a matter of personal preference. Try making several jars at once and leaving each of them to ferment for a different period of time -- this will help you to find the ""sweet spot"" between not fermented enough and too fermented.

, When fermenting fresh fruits (as opposed to canned fruits) it's necessary to make the syrup and let it ferment for several days before adding the fruit.









Start the syrup by mixing 1 cup of sugar with 2 cups of water and 1 packet of baking yeast in a jar with a loosely fitting lid. Pint or quart size mason jars work nicely.
Stir the mixture repeatedly until the sugar dissolves into the water.

, Loosely replace the lid of the jar and let it sit at room temperature for 3 to 4 days.









Look for bubbles to form at the top of the jar -- when you see these, you'll know that the yeast is alive and active and that the fermentation process has started.

, Once the syrup mixture has been left to ferment for 3 to 4 days, you can add the fresh fruit. Refer to the section above for ideas on which fruits work best in fermentation.









Use fruit that is fully ripe, with no bruises or blemishes. Choose organic where possible.
Wash the fruits, remover any skin, large seeds or pits and chop or slice into even size pieces.

, Open the jar of fermented syrup and add equal parts sugar and fresh fruit. Stir to dissolve the sugar.









Congratulations -- you have successfully finished fermenting fruit. You can eat the fruit right away or you can loosely replace the lid and leave the flavors to develop for a few more days.
This is also a good time to add any additional flavors, like cinnamon sticks or vanilla pods.

Cut the tomatoes into decent sizes. Cherry tomatoes should be cut in half, roma (plum) tomatoes should be cut in halves or quarters, and larger tomatoes should be cut into 1/4-inch (6.35 mm) slices.
Seeding the tomatoes is optional. Scoop out the seeds with a spoon, leaving the pulp behind. You can blot away extra juice with a clean paper towel.

, Spray the dehydrator trays with a light coating of cooking spray or rub a small amount of olive oil over the trays using another clean paper towel.


Greasing the trays will prevent the tomatoes from sticking. The oil can also add flavor to the tomatoes.

, Arrange the tomato pieces on your prepared dehydrator trays so that they are cut-side up and roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) apart from one another.


Do not layer the tomatoes or position them so that they touch one another. Doing so will cause the tomatoes to dehydrate unevenly.

, The simplest option would be to sprinkle the tomatoes with salt. Use as much or as little salt as desired according to your own personal tastes.


You could also use a light dusting of ground black pepper, garlic powder, or onion powder, or an herb blend made with chopped herbs like oregano, parsley, and thyme. Both dried herbs and fresh herbs will work.

, Place the racks in the dehydrator and dry the tomatoes for 8 to 12 hours, or until the tomatoes are smaller, shriveled, and leathery, but no longer tacky.


Keep roughly 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of space in between the racks. Doing so will ensure that there is enough air circulation to reach all the tomatoes.
Check the tomatoes every hour or so as they dehydrate. Rotate the racks if you notice that some tomatoes are drying more rapidly than others.
If some pieces dry faster than others, remove them to prevent them from becoming scorched or burnt.

, Once the tomatoes are ready, remove them from the oven and let them cool completely at room temperature. Pack them in freezer bags, vacuum sealed bags, plastic containers, or jars, and store them in a cool, dark place until you are ready to use them.


Usually, dehydrated tomatoes kept in cool temperatures in an airtight container will last for 6 to 9 months."

Store.",How to Dehydrate Tomatoes2," For the first part of the process, you will need to scorch the tomatoes at a temperature of 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius).Preheat the oven to that temperature first.


Meanwhile, prepare two baking sheets by lining them with nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper. You could also spray the baking sheets with nonstick cooking spray if you do not want to use foil or parchment paper, but note that foil and parchment paper will make it easier for you to clean up later on.
Use a rimmed baking sheet so that the excess juices and liquid produced during the process will be contained instead of dripping off into your oven.

, The tomatoes will need to be washed, dried, cored, and cut. Removing the seeds is an option, as well.


Note that you should not skin the tomatoes yet.
Rinse the tomatoes under cool, running water and pat them dry with clean paper towels.
Cut a cone shape out of the top stem end of each tomato to remove the core. Use a small paring knife to do so.
Cut the tomatoes into decent sizes. Cherry tomatoes should be cut in half, plum or roma tomatoes should be cut into halves or quarters, and larger tomatoes should be cut into 1/4-inch (6.35 mm) slices.
You can remove the seeds, if desired, but the seeds and pulp contain a lot of flavor, so many prefer to leave them in. If you decide to remove the seeds, scoop out the seeds with your finger or with a kitchen spoon and leave as much of the pulp behind as possible.

, Arrange the tomatoes on your prepared baking sheet with the cut-side facing up. Position them so that each piece is about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) apart from the others.


Do not stack the tomatoes or let them touch. Doing so could result in tomatoes that do not dehydrate evenly, so some may end up drying out or burning while others remain too moist to use.

, Popular seasonings for dehydrated tomatoes include salt, ground black pepper, herbs, garlic powder, and onion powder. Sprinkle the tomatoes with your seasoning of choice generously, or according to taste.


If you use herbs, go for options like oregano, parsley, and thyme. Both dried herbs and fresh herbs will work.
You could also scatter fresh minced or chopped garlic over the tomatoes instead of using garlic powder.

, Drizzle a fine stream of olive oil over the tomatoes, coating them evenly.


This oil enhances the flavor of the tomatoes and prevents them from cooking poorly.
If using store-bought olive oil in its original container, place your thumb over the spout as you pour so that you can control the speed and size of the stream more easily.

, Use your hands or tongs to flip the tomatoes over so that the skin-side faces up.


This is important since you will be scorching the tomatoes before you dehydrate them fully. By exposing the skin side to the direct heat, you prevent the tomato pulp from becoming too burnt too quickly.

, Place your tomatoes in the preheated oven and let them sit there for 30 minutes.


When ready, the skins will show signs of some wrinkling and some browning.

, Remove the tomatoes from the oven and pour off the excess liquid that has begun to leak out from the tomatoes. Remove the skins by pinching them in between tongs and peeling them off.


You can drain the liquid by tilting the pan and letting it run off into a bowl, or you could also suction the liquid away using a turkey baster.
As soon as you pull the tomatoes out of the oven, you should reduce the temperature to 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius). Do not finish roasting the tomatoes at 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius).

, Return the tomatoes to the oven and cook for another 3 to 4 hours. The finished tomatoes should look visibly dry with a few dark edges.


Flip the tomato pieces cut-side up after the first hour of cooking.
Drain or siphon away the excess juice every 30 minutes.

, Remove the tomatoes from the oven and let them cool at room temperature. When ready, you can store them in an airtight container or plastic bag, which can be frozen for up to three months.


Alternatively, place the tomatoes in a bowl and cove them with extra-virgin olive oil. Wrap the entire bowl in plastic wrap and refrigerate the tomatoes for up to 2 months.

Turn as needed.,
Store.",How to Dehydrate Tomatoes3," The tomatoes will need to be cleaned, dried, cored, cut, and seeded.


Before you begin, it is important to note that tomatoes should be sun-dried only in hot weather and low humidity. You will need roughly three days to complete the process, so wait until the weather forecast shows appropriate weather for at least that long.Note that you should not remove the skins.
Rinse the tomatoes under running water and pat them dry with clean paper towels.
Cut a cone shape out of the stem end of each tomato to remove the core. Use a small paring knife to do so.
Cut the tomatoes into two or more pieces. Cherry tomatoes should be cut in half, plum or roma tomatoes should be cut into halves or quarters, and larger tomatoes should be cut into 1/4-inch (6.35 mm) slices.
You should remove the seeds for this method. Scoop out the seeds with your finger or with a kitchen spoon, leaving as much of the pulp behind as possible.

, Arrange the tomatoes in trays with the cut-side facing down. Space each tomato portion about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) away from any other piece.


Do not let the tomatoes touch and do not stack them, since doing so will likely result in unevenly dried tomatoes.
Use a shallow, wood-framed tray. The tray should also have nylon netting for the bottom. Do not use a tray with a solid bottom, since a solid bottom will limit the amount of air circulation the tomatoes receive and may create mold-friendly conditions.

, Loosely lay a piece of protective netting or cheesecloth over the tray of tomatoes.


This protective layer will prevent insects, garden pests, and other potential hazards from harming your tomatoes.
Make sure that the protective layer is very porous and light so that enough heat and air can get through without difficulty.

, Set the tray of tomatoes in an area that receives as much direct sunlight as possible throughout the day. You should set the tray on wood or cement blocks instead of setting it directly on the ground.


You need blocks or some other object that can let air circulate up from the bottom of the tray. Adequate air circulation is essential for this method.

, The tomatoes will need to dry for about three days. After the first day and a half, turn the tomatoes over to expose the cut-side to the sunlight.


The trays should be placed in a sheltered location after sundown or if the weather becomes too cold, rainy, or otherwise moist.

, When ready, the tomatoes should be dry yet pliable. Package them in airtight containers, resealable plastic bags, or vacuum bags and store for 2 to 4 months in a cool, dry, and dark area.

Familiarise yourself with the reasons behind selecting any particular method of food preservation.,
Be aware of the different ways of preserving food.,
Select your method.",How to Choose a Method of Food Preservation," Your choice of food preservation will depend on weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of each method. You should consider the following factors when deciding on which method to use:



Space: The amount of space you have will definitely impact on your choice of preservation. Someone living in a farmhouse can probably store dozens of preserved fruits in jars, whereas someone living in an apartment is unlikely to have the space to spare for rows of preserved plums.

Climate: The climate can aid or hinder different storage methods. What might store beautifully through a Canadian winter may well rot during an Australian one.

Available equipment: Some preserving methods require specialised equipment that you may not have access to, or that you may be unwilling to use. For example, not everybody enjoys the sterilization process required to preserve fruit in jars and not everyone can build a smokehouse.

Cost: Naturally, the costs involved in preserving your food should be weighed against the cost of purchasing the food from a local market, supermarket or other source. In addition, there may be costs in using up storage space, costs in purchasing equipment etc. Care should be given, however, to include the benefits of enjoyment from preserving one's own food, as well as the health, environmental and nutrient benefits that might arise from preserving homegrown produce, costs that are very hard to quantify and should weigh heavily in your decision-making.

Nature of the food: Be realistic about the ability of the food to be preserved. Some food will not tolerate any form of preserving and needs to be eaten fresh. This means that you need to do your research. Also, some foods change during the preserving process and become less palatable or even take on characteristics that are less health-giving. For example, use of nitrites to preserve meat can turn healthy meat into a potentially carcinogenic product.

Hygiene and safety: Your ability to maintain a high level of hygiene and safety during the preservation process is important. If you cannot meet basic standards, it is best to not attempt a particular preservation method and to either substitute for a safer method or choose to not preserve the food.

Other issues: Perhaps there are health issues involved in preserving. For example, some people are unable to tolerate preservatives used to create dry fruit. Whilst it is possible to dry them organically, they will discolour and this may not be to the liking of some consumers.;
, There are many possible ways to preserve food and each one has different considerations. As discussed in the previous step, it is important to assess each of the possible preservation methods that you might be considering using against the factors that are outlined above.



Drying. Drying is an ancient technique of food preservation and works well for many food types. It is an inexpensive method of food preservation, as you rely on the sun or an oven. Dried foods are compact and easily stored or carried. The greatest disadvantages of drying food include loss of colour, loss of flavour and loss of vitamins. Some of these losses can be mitigated by not drying the food too long.

Salting: Salt is another ancient method of preservation. Salt can be used as part of the drying process. Salt increases the storage time of some foods such as fish and it enhances the flavour of dried foodstuffs. The use of a salt water brine is another common method of preservation and it has the benefit of stopping the growth of harmful organisms. Whilst it is possible to wash off excess brine or salt from salted food, this food will taste salty and the over-consumption of salt does carry a risk of disease.

Canning or bottling. This process requires canning equipment and the ability to use a heat source. Foods preserved by this method are sealed in a closed container, such as a can, glass jar or bottle. Such foods can be stored for up to a year. The cost of canning or bottling can be expensive after purchasing the equipment and use of heating fuel and it is a fiddly process requiring sterilization and knowledge of the temperatures involved. Canning cannot be done in an oven but must be done using a water or steam bath. There is a risk of severe food poisoning if this process is not followed properly, especially in the case of low-acid foods such as vegetables and meat.

Dehydration. There are many dehydration products on the market for a low price. Dehydration is a good means for making food small for storage or carrying on trips and it is easily restored to its original plumpness or juiciness through the addition of water.

Sugaring. Preserving through the use of tree saps or sugar is commonplace in some parts of the world. Trees such as the maple produce a syrup which is high in sugar and maple syrup can be stored for a long time. Sugar that is added to jams, jellies, relishes and preserves helps to lengthen the period of time that these condiments last.

Oil and fat. Some items can be stored in oil or fat. For example, herbs can be steeped in oil.

Live animals and plants. If there is room to grow plants and keep animals, this can be another method of preserving food. Naturally, there must be space and a knowledge of animal care is required. In some parts of the world, the possibility of an all-year round vegetable and fruit garden means that it is possible to be self-sufficient throughout the year without having to resort to other forms of preserving unless wished.

Curing and smoking. Drying using smoke can be used for meats, fish, cheese and nuts. Curing requires the addition of curing agents followed by smoking to preserve the food. Although smoked and cured meat can taste better, be aware that nitrates and nitrites can be carcinogenic.

Bin storage. If you have access to a cool, dark place, such as a cellar, it is possible to store foods for shorter periods of time just relying on the coolness of the room. Additional storage potential can be provided by storing items in bins filled with sand.

Pot-in-pot refrigeration. This method relies on the use of terracotta or clay pots that are lined with sand and kept cool through the addition of water. This method relies on evaporation and therefore only works in dry climates and it needs constant tending. This method of storage is best suited to places where electricity generation is not possible, such as selling locally grown produce at the market or in villages without refrigeration. The stored items should be consumed within a few days but the use of the pot-in-pot fridge helps to ensure that the goods remain in good, fresh condition during the time that they are stored and prevents decomposition during very hot weather.

Fermenting and pickling. Vegetables can be kept for several months using fermentation or pickling. Eggs can also be pickled to increase their shelf life. Pickles, sauerkraut and fermented soybean curd are examples of such foods. On the downside, there is evidence that the acidic nature of pickled foods can lead to health problems if consumed too much.

Refrigeration and freezing. Naturally this requires access to electricity-generated refrigeration systems but if you have this, it is one of the easiest methods to store food. There are many guidelines available on how long food can be stored in refrigeration or in a freezer and you will even find some of these guidelines in individual wikiHows on particular food items. Downsides to this method include loss of food due to not knowing what is in your freezer or lack of dating items when you freeze them (thus necessitating throwing out items when you are not sure) and a tendency to over-stock refrigerators with food that goes off because nobody could consume it in time, or find it behind all the other food. Be vigilant in cleaning out the fridge weekly and the freezer monthly, so that you know what precious food you have stocked away.

Chiller bags. Chiller bags or thermal lunch bags are great for short-term preservation of food. Use them to transport food such as ice cream or other frozen products from the store to your home. Use thermal lunch bags to keep lunch cool during the morning until lunchtime. Neither of these options has a long duration of preservation; at tops usually about 3 - 4 hours.

Thermos flask. A thermos flask is good keeping food such as tea, coffee, soup or even sausages hot or cold for a few hours. As with the chiller bag, this is a very short-term option but useful for school, work and day hikes.

, The method that suits you most may even be a combination of methods listed above, varying according to season and dependent on convenience. You might even choose to harvest a crop and use short and long term storage methods to enable you to use the crop now and into the future. Whatever drives your ultimate choice, be sure to observe all safety requirements and to label and date your preserved food if it is to be kept for a long period of time.

For example, if your kitchen tends to be cozier, place your black beans in a bowl of warm water there. When fermenting beans, they need to soak at least 24 hours before cooking.When fermenting beans, you need to start with dry beans rather than canned beans.;
, After 24 hours have passed, drain the beans using a colander. Then, you can cook them over the stove. Add some water to the beans. There is no precise amount of water to add, but more liquid is generally better. Make sure the beans are at least covered.To cook your beans, bring them to a boil. Let them boil for 10 minutes before reducing the heat to low. Simmer the beans for 40 minutes to an hour., Spices should be added to taste and it's up to you which spices you want. Black beans tend to pair well with spices like garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, cilantro, and fresh herbs., A culture helps beans ferment. You should add about a tablespoon of culture (15 mL) per cup of beans (240 mL). Cultures can be purchased online or at a health food store. Any of the following would be a good culture to ferment black beans:Whey culture
Powdered starter culture
Kombucha
Brine from lacto-fermented vegetables

, After mixing in your culture, gently mash the beans using a spoon. This will break the skins slightly and gently bruise the beans. This allows the culture to to bet past the skins and into the starch of the beans. The culture then converts the starch into probiotics., Beans need to process for several days to complete the fermenting process. Find a sealed container, such as a jar. Fill the container with your beans and seal the lid tightly. Place the jars in a warm place in your home where they will not be disturbed., Keep an eye on the jars while your beans are processing. When the lids are protruding, this means too much gas is building up int he jars. Open protruding jars to release the gas and then reseal them.Check on the beans a couple of times a day to see if any gas has built up.

, Fermented beans can be sprinkled over salads to add some extra nutrition. You can also mash fermented beans into a rich, flavorful dip to serve with things like tortilla chips.Fermented beans can also be eaten on their own as a snack.

, After your beans have fermented, you can keep storing them in the airtight containers you used to process them. Keep your beans in the fridge., Date your fermented beans when storing them. This way, you can keep track of when to throw them away. Fermented beans generally only last around six months."

Overripe tomatoes are bad for canning due to their high acid content. Gently press on the tomatoes to make sure they are still firm. Look over your tomatoes to make sure they do not have any bruises.If you want to can green tomatoes, you’re in luck. Green tomatoes are more acidic but can still be canned, according to the USDA.;
, Once they are free from dirt, slice off the ends that have the stems, and cut an ""X"" shape at the bottom of the other end. The ‘X’ shape will make it easier to peel off the skins later.

, To do this, you will need to bring a pot of water to a boil. You will also need to set out a bowl filled with ice water. Once the water is boiling, drop a few tomatoes in at a time. Let them sit in the water for about a minute (though you can take them out after 45 seconds if you want to.), Immediately plunge them into the bowl filled with ice water. Doing this will help to make the tomato skins fall right off. Remove the skins and place your tomatoes on a cutting board..

, While quartering your tomatoes, remove any other bruises or tough spots. If you didn’t already, remove the tough part where the tomato attaches to its stem.

, Anytime you can fruit or vegetables, you must sanitize the jars. To do this, bring a large pot of water to a boil (it can be the same pot you are later going to use for sealing the jars and canning the tomatoes.) Inspect the jars to make sure they are free from cracks or nicks and then place the jars in the water and let them boil for several minutes.You can also sterilize your jars by putting them in your dishwasher on the hottest cycle. If you have a ‘sterilize’ option, choose it.

, The lids should be dent free, and the bands should fit tightly. Set the bands aside to dry, and place the jars and lids in a pot of hot, but not boiling, water. Let the pot simmer on the stove at low heat until you are ready to use the jars.

, To do this, you should use tongs. Be very carefully as the jars will be very hot. To remove the lids, you can either use the tongs, or you can use a magnetic lid lifter. These lid lifters can be purchased at your local kitchen supply store.

, You can either use fresh lemon juice, or lemon juice from a bottle. The lemon juice will be added to the jar along with the tomatoes. The juice helps to prevent the tomatoes from spoiling while they are in the jars, and also helps to retain the color and flavor of the tomatoes.

, Place the jars on a heat resistant surface and begin spooning the quartered tomatoes into the jars. Fill the jars until there is only about ½ of an inch of space left at the top of the jars. Add two tablespoons of lemon juice. You should also add either boiling water or hot tomato juice so that the jar is filled up to ½ an inch away from the top.You could also consider adding other ingredients to enhance the flavor of the tomatoes. Cloves of garlic, peppers, or a sprig of basil make delicious additions to canned tomatoes.

, Once you have added the lemon juice, gently press on the tomatoes with a spoon to release air bubbles. Air bubbles are bad because they can let bacteria get into the jars, thus spoiling your canned tomatoes. You should also slide a sterilized knife or plastic spoon along the inside wall of the jar, releasing any air trapped there., Place a lid on top of the jar and screw on the band with your hands.

, The pot should be large enough to fit a batch of canning jars. Place the elevated canning rack in this pot, and fill halfway with water. Bring to a simmer. If you are using an actual canner, the rack should have come with it. If you are just using a pot, you can use a cooking rack so long as it fits in the pot.If you plan on doing a lot of canning, particularly of low-acid items like tomatoes, you should think about investing in a pressure canner. They take less time and are reliable. If you have a pressure canner and are planning on using it now, follow the instructions provided with the canner when you bought it.
If you do not have a cooking rack, you can just place a washcloth on the bottom of the pot. This will keep the glass jars from cracking against the metal of the pot.

, Once all the jars have been placed, lower the canning rack. Pour enough water into the simmering canning pot to cover the jars by two inches. Place the lid on the canning pot and bring to a boil. If you are using pints, boil the jars for 40 minutes. If you are using quarts, boil the jars for 45 minutes. You should also keep in mind that cooking time will vary based on what altitude you are canning at.0 to 1,000 feet (0.0 to 304.8 m) above sea level: 35 minutes for pints, 45 minutes for quarts.
1,001 to 3,000 feet (305.1 to 914.4 m): 40 minutes for pints, 50 minutes for quarts.
3,001 to 6,000 feet (914.7 to 1,828.8 m): 45 minutes for pints, 55 minutes for quarts.
Above 6,000 feet (1,828.8 m): 50 minutes for pints, 60 minutes for quarts.

, Allow the pot to cool for 20 minutes, and then remove each jar with the lifter. Place the jars on a towel. Allow jars to cool for a whole day, and then test the seal on the jars by pushing down in the center. The center should not move. If it does, use the tomatoes immediately.

, Do not be surprised if you see the canned tomatoes floating above a layer of liquid inside the jar--this is totally normal.

If you wouldn't eat it fresh, you probably shouldn't can it., Use a vegetable scrubber to thoroughly wash the skins in warm water., Use a very sharp knife or vegetable peeler to remove the skin.If you are having trouble peeling the squash, try poking holes in the skin and microwaving it for a few minutes. A good-sized butternut squash takes 3 to 4 minutes. You should have an easier time removing the peel after microwaving them., With a very sharp knife, cube the squash. You should aim for 1-inch cubes.You shouldn't mash the squash before canning. Experts have not decided on safe processing times for canning mashed or pureed squash.

, Keep the jars and lids hot until they are ready to be filled.You can keep your jars hot by submerging them in hot water. You can also leave them in the dishwasher after washing them there.Because the final product will be processed for 10 minutes in a pressure canner, you don't need to sterilize the jars before filling., Use enough water to cover the squash, but don't add the squash yet. Once the water boils, add the squash. Leave it in the hot water for 2 minutes.

, Use the liquid to pour over the squash. Leave an inch or less at the top.

, Stir each jar gently to allow air bubbles to escape and cover with the metal lids. Screw on the ring of the mason jar., Place the sealed jars on the rack in the pressure canner.Since squash is a low-acid food, use a pressure canner to prevent bacterial contamination.The steam needs to flow around the jars. Do not set the jars on the bottom of the canner. Instead, they should go on the canner's rack. Also, leave space around the jars., Cover the canner. Heat up the canner so that it's boiling. Start your timer once you see steam rising, and let it go for 10 minutes. Don't close the vents during this 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, close the vents or set the weighted gauge on top. , Adjust the pressure based on your altitude (see guide below).Start timing when the right pressure is reached. Check the gauge frequently to ensure the pressure remains constant.


For dial gauge canners, set pressure to 11 PSI (75.8 kPa) for altitudes of 0 to 2000 feet (0 to 610 m), 12 PSI (82.7 kPa) for altitudes of 2001 to 4000 feet (610 to 1220 m), 13 PSI (89.6 kPa) for altitudes of 4,001 to 6,000 feet (1,000 to 2,000 m) (1220 to 1830 m), and 14 PSI (96.5 kPa) for 6001 to 8000 feet (1830 to 2440 m).For weighted gauge canners set pressure to 10 PSI (68.95 kPa) for altitudes of 0 to 1000 feet (0 to 305 m) and 15 PSI (103.4 kPa) for altitudes above 1,000 feet (304.8 m)., Allow the pressure to return to 0 PSI (0 kPa). When it reaches, zero, take the weights off or open the vent. Leave it alone for two minutes, then take off the lid. Watch out for the steam., Use a jar lifter to take out the jars. Don't place them on a cold kitchen counter, which could crack the glass. Instead, use a wooden board or lay down a towel for them. Leave a little space between jars for air flow., Make sure you picked an area that isn't drafty.Listen for a small “ping” sound indicating that the seal of the jar lids has been sucked down, and the jars are properly sealed. You can also press the top. You shouldn't be able to press it down farther if it is properly sealed.

, Peel away the outer leaves of the cabbage, which often look wilted and limp. You should also remove any leaves that appear to have been damaged by insects or other sources.


Work with 5 lbs (2250 g) of cabbage at a time. Do not attempt to work with the whole batch at once, since doing so can make it difficult for the cabbage to ferment properly.

, Clean the cabbage by rinsing it under cool, running water. Let drain into a colander or over several layers of clean paper towels.

, Cut the cabbage heads into quarters. With the core pieces now exposed, cut them out, as well.


To make the cabbage easier to work with, you might even wish to cut each head into eighths.

, Use a knife, box shredder, or food processor to create finely shredded strips of cabbage from each quarter.


Each ribbon should be about 1/16 inch (1.5875 mm) wide.
If using a knife, slice across each quarter or eighth crosswise, naturally separating the leaves into ribbons.
You could also use a food processor with a slicing attachment or a mandoline.
Remove any especially large or tough pieces from the pile of shredded cabbage and discard.

, Stir in 3 Tbsp (45 ml) of salt per 5 lb (2250 g) of cabbage. Mix well to combine.


Place the shredded cabbage into a large stone crock, large glass bowl, or large food-grade plastic container. Do not use metal or any container that is not approved for use with food or drink.
After mixing the pickling salt and cabbage together with your hands, let the cabbage stand unattended for 15 minutes. The juices should begin to flow during this time, and you should notice the cabbage starting to wilt.

, Use your hands or a wooden spoon to press down on the cabbage, causing juice to rise to the surface of the shredded leaves.


Repeat the entire procedure four more times to use up the remaining 20 lb (9 kg) of cabbage. Sprinkle any leftover salt over all the cabbage evenly.
You should make sure that there is at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between the cabbage and the rim of the container.

, If you did not manage to squeeze out enough juice to cover the surface of the cabbage completely, you should prepare a brine of water and salt to pour over the cabbage, instead.


Prepare a brine by combining 4 1/2 tsp (22.5 ml) pickling salt and 4 cups (1 L) of water in a saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to dissolve the salt. Remove it from the heat and let it cool to room temperature. Once cool, you can ladle or pour it over the sauerkraut.

, Place a large, inverted plate over the cabbage mixture. Set two or three sealed quart-size (liter-size) jars filled with water on top of the plate to weigh it down and continue pressing the cabbage.


Cover the entire dish with a clean, heavy towel or piece of cheesecloth.
Let the dish sit in a cool place.

, Watch the dish of cabbage daily. Gas bubbles form during the fermentation process, so once these bubbles stop forming, you can conclude the fermentation is complete and the sauerkraut is ready to either enjoy or can.


Fermentation can take as little as 3 days and as long as 6 weeks. Large batches like this one usually take at least 3 weeks, though, and may require the full 6 weeks.
Keep the sauerkraut out of direct sunlight. Note that the ideal temperature conditions are between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 24 degrees Celsius).
Each day, you should remove and discard any white scum that forms on the surface of the cabbage. This scum is a healthy, natural bi-product of the chemical fermentation process, but it should still be skimmed off to prevent too much from building up.
If any mold forms, skim it and discard it immediately. Make sure that the cabbage is fully submerged before pressing forward. Any part that was near the surface, where the mold was, should be discarded, but the rest is still fine.

, Fill a boiling water canner with water and let that water reach a simmer.Place the glass canning jars and lids inside the water for a few minutes.


If using canning jars with two-piece lids, sanitize the main part of the lid in this manner but set the band or ring aside. This can be cleaned in hot, soapy water but not in the simmering water of the canner.
Do not boil the water at this time.
Note that other types of canners are not recommended for canning sauerkraut.

, Place the fermented sauerkraut and its brine in a large stainless steel saucepan or stockpot and set it on the stove. Bring it all up to a simmer over medium-high heat.


Stir frequently as it cooks.
Do not allow it to reach a rolling or rapid boil.
Remove from the heat once the simmer is consistent and the sauerkraut is heated through.

, Scoop the sauerkraut out of the saucepan and transfer it immediately to your prepared canning jars. Pack the sauerkraut and brine into each jar tightly, leaving 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace at the top of the jar.


If you do not leave enough headspace, the pressure inside the jar might build up and cause it to burst during the canning process.
Tap on the side of the jar with your fingers or a metal utensil to gently remove the air bubbles trapped inside. Adjust headspace as necessary by adding more brine.
Wipe the rim of the jar with a clean towel before applying the lid and the band on top. The fit should be ""fingertip"" tight, or as tight as you can screw it on with your fingertips.

, Gently lower your jars of sauerkraut into the boiling water canner using jar tongs. Let them boil, on average, 10 minutes for pint (1/2 L) jars and 15 minutes for quart (L) jars. You may need to adjust for altitude, though.


At an altitude between 0 and 1000 feet (305 m), process pint (1/2 L) jars for 10 minutes. Change this to 15 minutes for altitudes between 1000 and 6000 feet (305 and 1830 m) and 20 minutes for those above 6000 feet (1830 m).
At an altitude between 0 and 1000 feet (305 m), process quart (L) jars for 15 minutes. Change this to 20 minutes for altitudes between 1000 and 6000 feet (305 and 1830 m) or 25 minutes for those about 6000 feet (1830 m).

, Use jar tongs to lift the jars of sauerkraut out of the water when ready. Remove the jars and let them cool at room temperature before placing them in long-term storage.


Check the center button in the middle of each lid after 24 hours pass. This button should not move up and down when you press it. If it does, the sauerkraut has not been properly canned and should be consumed within a week or so.
The cans that have properly sealed can be stored in a dark, cool, and dry cupboard for up to 2 to 3 years.

, The jars and lids should be sanitized in hot water prior to use. Fill your boiling water canner with water and bring that water to a simmer. Place the glass canning jars in the water so that they are completely submerged and filled with the simmering water. Add your lids, as well.

Do not sanitize the band or ring of the lid in this manner, though. These can be washed in plain hot, soapy water.
Do not let the water boil.
Remove the cans and lids after a few minutes.
Note that only a boiling water canner is recommended for canning sauerkraut. Do not try other canners.

, Back the raw, cool sauerkraut and brine into the hot jars, leaving about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace at the top of the jars. Pack the sauerkraut in firmly.

The sauerkraut and pressure inside the jar can expand during the canning process. If you pack the jars too full, you may end up causing them to burst open as the sauerkraut sits in the canner.
Use a metal spoon or your hand to tap on the side of the jar, gently removing the air bubbles trapped deep down. If you need to fill up more headspace afterward, add more brine.
Wipe the rim of the jar clean with a clean towel or paper towel.
Center the lid on top of the mouth of the jar. Screw the band on over the lid as tightly as possible.

, Use jar tongs to carefully lower each jar into the boiling water canner. Bring the water to a boil and let the jars of sauerkraut process for 20 minutes if using pint (1/2 L) jars or 25 minutes if using quart (L) jars.Note that the above processing times only apply if you are at an altitude between 0 and 1000 feet (0 and 305 m). If you are at a higher altitude, you will need to adjust the processing time.
At an altitude between 1000 and 3000 feet (305 and 914 m), process pint (1/2 L) jars for 25 minutes. Change this to 30 minutes for altitudes between 3000 and 6000 feet (914 and 1830 m) and 35 minutes for those above 6000 feet (1830 m).
At an altitude between 1000 and 3000 feet (305 and 914 m), process quart (L) jars for 30 minutes. Change this to 35 minutes for altitudes between 3000 and 6000 feet (914 and 1830 m) and 40 minutes for those above 6000 feet (1830 m).

, Lift the processed jars out of the canner using jar tongs. Place them gently on soft dish towels and let cool completely, at room temperature, before placing them in long-term storage.

Press down on the center of each lid after 24 hours. If the center moves up and down, the sauerkraut has not been properly canned and you should consume it within a week or so.
If the jars are properly sealed, though, you can store them unopened in a dark, cool place for up to 2 to 3 years.

Assess your personal situation.,
Read advertisements from the local paper to see what's on sale at your local grocery store.,
Plan your dinners for each night at the beginning of the week, choosing entrees that will fit in the criteria you defined above.,
Write down all the ingredients you will need for each dinner on a central list.,
Take an inventory of your pantry, refrigerator, and freezer before you go.,
Use leftovers whenever possible in your menu planning.,
Visit your local grocery store to purchase the items on your list.,
Ask family members to help in meal preparation, including cleaning up before and after.,
Recycle your menu plans.",How to Prepare Dinner for the Week," Before you begin you must understand what will or won't work for you. Answering these questions first will help set the stage for planning weekly dinners ahead of time.


When is the best time of the week for you to do the grocery shopping?
Do you have enough refrigerator/freezer space to hold a week's worth of food?
Do you have a specific time of day that works best for everyone to eat? How much time can you dedicate each evening to cooking?
Do you have a food budget you need to stick to?;
, Knowing what's on sale can help you plan the dinners and save you money.

, You can research recipe ideas on the Internet, or in cookbooks. Pay attention to total cooking times, which many recipes list at the top, as this information will help determine if you will have time to cook the meal.

, This is the master list you will use to shop for groceries. Consider organizing your list to follow the set up of your local grocery store, which may save additional time when shopping.

, Write down any staple items on your list that need to be replenished, such as milk, eggs, or butter.

, If you make a ham one night, look for recipes that call for ham in different ways for the next couple of nights. This option will take a lot of pressure off you by cutting cooking times significantly while still offering variety of food choices.

, Optimally, you should only shop once a week. If possible, shop early in the morning on the day you go, which generally is a less busy shopping time.

, Whether it's chopping vegetables or setting the table, anything you don't have to do can cut down on prep time. If you have children, this is a terrific opportunity to take the mystery out of cooking and help them develop cooking skills they will need as adults.

, Save each week's menu plan in a file, and use them again in the future. Having a ready-made plan can be very handy in the future. Once you build a big enough file, you may only have to repeat dinners rarely if you so desire.

These go in salads, soups, juices, smoothies, and can even be used as burrito and taco substitutes. Here are some of the greens you should stock up on at the grocery store or farmers market:Lettuce
Spinach
Kale
Chard
Collards
Beet and turnip greens
Dandelion greens;
, Fresh produce makes up the majority of a raw food diet, and some raw dieters get up to 80 percent of their calories from these foods. Your crisper should look like a rainbow when you get back from grocery shopping, so make sure to pick up produce in all colors, such as:Oranges, carrots, pumpkin, peaches, and mango
Lemons, yellow peppers, banana, pineapple, and yellow zucchini
Green apples, green peppers, avocado, green beans, kiwi, and broccoli
Red apples, beets, tomatoes, red peppers, and strawberries,
Purple cabbage, egg plant, purple potatoes, grapes, and blackberries
White foods like potatoes, garlic, turnip, and onions

, Grains, beans, and legumes are an important part of the raw diet for the calories and nutrients they provide. While raw dieters don’t cook pulses, they do sprout them to make the nutrients more bioavailable. Good grains, beans, and legumes for sprouting include:Lentils
Millet
Chickpeas
Kidney beans
Peas
Buckwheat

, Nuts and seeds are an important part of a raw diet because they provide protein, calories, healthy fats, and other vital nutrients. You can eat any kind of nut and seed you like, as long as it hasn’t been roasted. Some favorites include:

Peanuts
Walnuts
Macadamia nuts
Sesame seeds
Sunflower seeds
Pine nuts
Chia seeds
Hemp hearts
Nut butters

, Most cooking oils that people use have been processed at high heat, making them unsuitable for raw dieters. However, there are a few oils that raw adherents can consume, including cold-pressed extra-virgin olive oil and cold-pressed coconut oil., Raw food doesn’t mean plain or boring, and there are lots of tasty treats and snacks you should always have on hand if you get peckish or want to prepare a meal. Miscellaneous items you should buy at the store include:Raw cacao
Apple cider vinegar
Vanilla extract
Dried fruit
Dried coconut
Herbs
Spices
Dates

, Fruits and vegetables are staples in a raw diet, and they're often eaten whole or chopped into smaller pieces for salads and cocktails. To prepare fruits and vegetables for eating this way:Wash them under running water and scrub hard produce with a vegetable brush
Pat produce dry, or spin lettuce and greens in a salad spinner
Remove cores, stems, and seeds
Leave lettuce leaves whole for tacos, or chop them into shreds for salads
Chop larger fruits and veggies into one-inch (2.5-cm) cubes
Leave smaller fruits like cherries and berries whole

, Raw dieters eat salad for any meal of the day. You can make a salad with any combination of fruits and veggies you like. To make any salad, simply toss together your favorite combination of bite-sized fruits and veggies in a large bowl, add dried fruit, nuts, and seeds, and dress with your favorite toppings before serving.

To make specific salads, you can try a basic garden salad, spinach salad with baby spinach and berries, Caprese salad with raw tomato and raw mozzarella, or fruit salad.

, Raw dieters don’t eat hot soup because that would require cooking the food, but you can make raw soups with uncooked fruits and veggies. For instance, you can make a raw carrot soup by blending together:1 cup (235 ml) carrot juice
Half an avocado
1 teaspoon (5 ml) freshly squeezed lime juice
A pinch of curry powder
A pinch of salt
Minced fresh cilantro (for garnish)

, Juicing is a good way to get a quick boost of energy and extra nutrients into your diet. You can juice just about any fruit or vegetable in any combination, and can even add spices and herbs to change up the flavors.

Avoid juicing soft produce like avocados and bananas, as these can get caught in the juicer.
It’s important to drink fresh juices in moderation, however, because the fiber has been removed, and this increases sugar absorption., Sprouting and soaking are integral in raw diets because raw dieters don’t cook food, and sprouting and soaking make the nutrients easier to digest. Make sure you give yourself at least 24 hours to soak or sprout, because the process takes time., Dehydrating is the process of removing water from foods at a low heat. You can do this with a dehydrator or low oven, as long as you keep the dehydrator or oven below 115 F (45 C).

Popular foods to dehydrate include fruits, vegetables, bread alternatives, and meat.

, Raw fruits and vegetables are lower in calories than other foods, so it’s important to make sure that you eat three meals throughout the day, and have snacks whenever you're hungry. Breakfast is a very important meal, and there are lots of things you can eat for your first meal of the day on a raw diet, such as:Fresh fruit smoothies
Granola
Raw nut milk
Fresh fruit
Oatmeal
Dairy or non-dairy yogurt

, The world is your oyster when it comes to raw meals, because there are so many different types of fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains, and seeds out there. It’s good to have a few staples you can fall back on for a quick lunch though, and those could include:Salad with avocado dressing
Raw soup
Raw veggies with cheese dip or hummus
Raw quiche
Raw lasagna (made with zucchini slices instead of pasta)
Fresh fruit with nut butter
Raw cheese and crackers

, Depending on the size of your lunch and your schedule, dinner may be the biggest meal of the day. When dinner is your main meal, you want to make sure you have some great ideas ready if you don’t have anything planned. Here are some great and easy ideas for raw dinners:

Burritos (made with lettuce wraps)
Salad with nuts and sprouts
Sprouted lentils or beans
Raw tofu with veggies
Veggie burger
Large salad
Raw pizza (made in a dehydrator)
Sashimi, Snacking throughout the day is encouraged if you feel hungry, so you should always have some snack ideas at the ready. Along with raw fruits and vegetables, good snacks can include:Nuts
Seeds
Dried fruit
Granola

, Just because you're on a raw diet doesn’t mean you can't have dessert. In fact, raw desserts are often delicious and extremely healthy, so you can even get away with eating them as snacks and for breakfast! Some typical raw desserts include:No-bake brownies and cookies that use dates and nuts rather than flour
No-cook puddings
Chia pudding
Cheesecake
Dairy or non-dairy ice cream

Wash and prepare your fruit.,
Cook the fruit with the sugar and water.,
Strain and reserve the fruit liquid.,
Stir in additional herbs or spices (optional).",How to Can Syrup1," Decide what kind of fruit syrup you'd like to make. Wash your fresh fruit and trim off any stems, peels, or ends. Roughly chop the fruit and place it in a large pot. Keep track of how many cups of fruit you use. To make a fruit syrup, you'll use four parts fruit, two parts sugar, and one part water.For example, if you want to make a blueberry syrup, you could use 4 cups of blueberries, 2 cups of sugar, and 1 cup of water. Or if you're using the metric system, try 400 g of blueberries, 200 g of sugar, and 100 ml of water.
Consider making syrup using strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, rhubarb, or oranges.;
, Add two parts of sugar for every four parts of fruit you prepared. Stir in one part of water and turn the heat on to medium. Let the fruit mixture bubble gently. Simmer the mixture and stir it occasionally until the fruit is completely softened and has released extra liquid. This may take anywhere from 5 minutes to 20 or 30 minutes, depending on the type of fruit you're using.The liquid in the pot should thicken and become syrupy.

, Place a fine mesh strainer over a measuring jug or bowl. Slowly pour the cooked fruit mixture into the strainer. The syrup should drain through the strainer. Discard the solids that are left in the strainer., If you'd like to add fresh herbs or spices to your syrups, you can stir them in now. Consider adding a few pinches of ground cinnamon or nutmeg. If you want to add herbs, consider adding:Thyme
Basil
Bay leaves

Consider adding fresh herbs or spices to the simple syrup.,
Use the simple syrup to can fruit.",How to Can Syrup2," If you'll be canning fresh fruit (like plums or peaches) and want a sweet syrup to pour in the jars, make a simple syrup. You can create a thick, sweet syrup or a light, thin syrup. Just place the sugar and water in a pot and heat it over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. To make:Heavy syrup: use 4 1/4 cups of sugar (900 g) and 4 1/4 cups (1 liter) of water to make 7 cups (2.27 kg) of syrup
Medium syrup: use 3 1/4 cups (650 g) of sugar and 5 cups (1.2 liters) of water to make 7 cups (2.27 kg)syrup
Light syrup: use 2 1/4 cups (450 g) of sugar and 5 1/4 cups (1.25 liters) of water to make 6 1/2 cups (2.1 kg) syrup

, For spiced preserved fruit, add a little ground cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, or star anise. For slightly savory flavorings, you can add fresh sprigs of rosemary, thyme, basil or a few dried bay leaves.You can add the dried herbs or spices to the syrup itself or place the fresh sprigs directly into the jars.

, Place the fruit you'd like to preserve into your sterilized jars. Follow your recipe to prepare the fruit. Pour the simple syrup over the fruit in the jars until it comes 1/2-inch (12 mm) from the top. Apply warm lids and screw on the bands until they're fingertip tight. Process the jars in a water bath for 10 minutes.You can store properly canned fruit in simple syrup for up to one year.

Cool the jars and store the syrup.",How to Can Syrup3," Place a large water bath canner or pot on the stove. Place a wire rack in the bottom of the pot and fill the pot about three-quarters full of water. Bring the water to a boil. To sterilize the jars, you can either place several half-pint (250 ml) jars in the pot so they boil along with the water or you can run them through the dishwasher.Keep the jars warm while you're preparing the syrup or fruit.

, Put new lids that have a fresh seal into a small pot. Cover them with water and turn the heat to medium. Let the lids simmer while you prepare the syrup. This will soften the lids so they create a good seal with the jars.You won't need to sterilize or heat the bands. Just have clean bands out on your work space.

, Set the warm, empty jars on a kitchen towel on your work space. Place a funnel in the jar and use a ladle to carefully fill the jars. Leave 1/2 inch (12 mm) headspace at the top of the jar. Remove the funnel and use a clean cloth to wipe around the rim of the jar. Repeat this until you've used all of the syrup.Keep in mind that if you aren't able to completely fill the last jar, you'll need to store it in the fridge and use it within several weeks. If you have more than 1/2 inch (12 mm) headspace, there will be too much space in the jar to safely can the syrup.

, Carefully lift the warm lids from the small pot. Place a lid on each jar and screw a clean band on it. Avoid screwing the band on tightly or the air in the jar will not have a way to escape while it's processing. The band should only be fingertip tight.You may want to use a kitchen towel to handle the jars since they will be hot.

, Turn the heat to high on your water bath canner and gently lower the filled jars into the water. They should set on the wire rack and the jars shouldn't be touching each other. Bring the water to a boil and put the lid on the pot. Process (boil) the jars for 10 minutes., Turn off the heat and use a jar lifter to carefully pull the canned syrup out of the water bath canner. Place the jars on a kitchen towel on your work space. Let the jars cool completely. Check the seals the next day to ensure that the jars were processed correctly. You can store the jars of syrup for up to one year.Remember to check the seals before you open the syrup.
Touch the center of the lid to test the seal. If it springs back or is flexible, the jar is not sealed properly. You could also look at the lid at eye level. It should bend down slightly in the center. If it's flat or bulging up, it's not sealed properly.

, Mix and match foods from each food group for well-rounded, nutritious snacks.

, Fill whole grain tortillas with just about anything your child likes for a quick snack. Try lean meats and cheeses with lettuce and tomatoes, or almond butter with fresh fruit slices. Roll into a tight wrap and enjoy.

, Make a veggie tray with fresh broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, celery, cucumbers, pickles or other vegetables that your child likes and serve with their favorite hummus or other low-fat dip.

Set out the one-dish meal for the group to enjoy.",How to Plan One‐Dish Meals for a Group," To make a one-dish meal, you will need access to a large cooking pot. The pot may be made of cast iron to ensure even cooking and to allow you to use the pot on the stove and in the oven. Or you may use a large skillet with a handle and a lid that is safe for use on a stove top.Make sure the pot is large enough to fit several ingredients, including vegetables and meat. You may opt for a cooking pot that is deep, rather than wide, especially if you are planning to cook for a large group and require a lot of ingredients.
You can also use a casserole dish with a lid as your cooking pot as long as it is oven safe.;
, You can prepare one-dish meals by using a large flat cooking pan that can fit in your oven. You may then lay out the ingredients on the pan and cook the meal in one go in the oven. Look for a cooking pan that is one to two inches deep and safe for use in the oven.You should go for a cooking pan that is non-stick so your ingredients do not get stuck on the pan once they are cooked. If the cooking pan is not non-stick, you can always line it with parchment paper to protect the pan and keep the food from sticking.
If you are using a non-stick pan with a Teflon coating, you should only cook food at a low to medium temperature. You may only cook food on the stove and avoid using non-stick pans in the oven, as high temperatures can release toxic vapors in the pan., If you do not want to have to worry about keeping an eye on the stove top or the oven, you may use a crock pot to cook your one-dish meal. Crock pots are ideal for cooking one-dish meals over long periods of time, as you do not need to monitor the crock pot or check the dish very often as it cooks. Many crock pots have timers that you can set so the crock pot turns off automatically once it is done cooking.You can buy crock pots online or at any cooking supply store.

, Before you get any ingredients for the dish or choose a specific recipe, you should consider how many people you intend to feed with the meal. Planning a meal for four to six people may mean using a standard one-dish meal. But a meal for six to eight people may mean you prepare more than one-dish meal or double the recipe to ensure everyone gets enough food.When you search for recipes, note the amount of people the recipe will feed, often printed in the top section of the recipe, right before the ingredients list. Make sure you choose a recipe that will feed the amount of people in your group. Double the recipe or use another dish to make a duplicate meal so you are not short on food.

, Start by searching for one-dish meals online or in your favorite cookbooks. If you are looking at recipes online, read reviews of the recipe to ensure it is highly rated. Go for a certain flavor profile, such as a Thai curry one-dish meal or a Southern comfort food one-dish meal, based on your tastes. Opt for a vegetarian one-dish meal if you are going for a no-meat meal or choose a meat heavy meal if you are cooking for a carnivorous crowd.For example, you may make a one pot spaghetti if you are going for an Italian flavor profile. You may make a rice, vegetable, and meat one-dish meal or a chicken and rice casserole for a more basic flavor profile.

, If you have only two hours to prepare the one-dish meal, for example, you may go for a one-dish meal that takes one hour and is not expensive to prepare. You may opt for a recipe that uses only a few basic ingredients so you do not spend too much money on preparing the meal or splurge on one ingredient that may be more expensive, such as a nice cut of meat, and keep the rest of the ingredients cheap.


If you have the day to prepare the meal, you may go for a recipe that takes more time or involves the use of a crock pot. You can then prepare the ingredients and let the meal simmer in the crock pot until it is ready at night for dinner.
You can find easy, fast one-dish meals for a group online at the FoodNetwork.com and RealSimple.com.

, Once you have chosen the recipe, go shopping for the ingredients. Make a list of ingredients and be sure to check your pantry for ingredients you already have before you go shopping. You may make a rough estimate of how much the ingredients are going to cost and go to multiple stores for the best deal on items so you do not go over budget for the meal.If your chosen one-dish meal requires fresh vegetables, you may try to shop for them the day you are planning to make the meal so the vegetables taste their best in the dish.
If the dish requires meat, you may get frozen meat beforehand so you can cook it easily the day of. Or, if you have time, get fresh meat from a butcher the day you are making the meal and keep it refrigerated until you are ready to cook.
If the dish includes a starch like rice or potatoes, make sure you have these ingredients on hand. Most one-dish recipes allow you to cook the starch all together with the vegetables and the meat or protein in one pot or on one tray.

, Most one-dish meals require you to chop up vegetables before you start cooking. You may also need to cut up raw meat and thaw frozen meat before you cook with it. You should measure out any spices or herbs so they are on hand when you start cooking.For example, if you were making a roasted vegetables and pork chops one-dish meal, you would cut up the vegetables and have the pork chops on hand. You would also prepare the marinade for the pork chops and the vegetables. This will make it easier to put everything together once it comes time to cook the meal.

, Most one-dish meals take very little time to prepare and cook. Depending on the recipe, you may only have to complete five to six steps, making it easy and fast for you to prepare the dish. Make sure you read over the recipe and allot yourself enough time to prepare and cook the meal based on the planned time of your meal.If the dish has a meat component, for example, you may cook the meat in the pot or skillet first and then add in the vegetables and the rice or potatoes next. Or, if you are using a crock pot to make the one-dish meal, you may put all the ingredients in the crock pot and let them cook for a longer period of time.

, Once the meal is done cooking, you should set it out for the group to enjoy. You may put the dish on the table and have everyone serve themselves or you may serve a portion to each guest on a plate. The beauty of one-dish meals is you do not need to have to worry about any side dishes or appetizers, making them easy to serve and enjoy with a group.


Depending on the one-dish meal, you may add toppings to the dish. For example, a soup may be topped with roasted seeds, grated cheese, or bread crumbs. Or you may serve a one-dish curry with lemon wedges and chopped parsley or cilantro on top.

Plan your meals using ChooseMyPlate.,
Buy adequate containers to store frozen food.,
Choose meals with ingredients that freeze well.,
Set up an assembly line.,
Try one-pot meals.",How to Prepare Healthy Meals for One Person1," The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has a meal planning website at choosemyplate.gov that will provide you with choices for a healthy, balanced meal appropriate to your age and gender.The food portions are based on the USDA healthy eating guidelines. You can read information on the website about the different food groups and the reasoning behind the portions selected.
You also can download and print tip sheets, as well as recipes from USDA cookbooks, including the recipes used to cook for the first family in the White House.
The website also includes sample 7-day and two week menus that will allow you to add variety to your meals without breaking your budget.
If you're trying to lose weight or change your diet for other health reasons, check out the online tools, including a tracking app that can help you monitor your food and exercise.;
, One good way to eat healthy as a single person is to make a full recipe and then freeze the excess portions. However, you need to be able to store those portions properly so they will freeze completely and not get freezer burn.Invest in a set of smaller storage containers that will allow you to separate food into single servings. That way you aren't constantly re-heating and re-freezing your food.
You also want to be able to store sides separately so that you can mix and match, rather than having to eat the exact same meal every day for a week.
Get plastic wrap and foil to seal foods properly. Putting a double layer of both plastic and foil on casseroles and other one-pot meals can prevent freezer burn.

, Some ingredients, particularly meats, fruits, and many vegetables, will taste just as good if you freeze them as they would if you ate them right after you cooked them. Others don't stand up to sub-zero temperatures.For example, cooked pasta doesn't freeze well. However, if you want spaghetti, you can make a larger batch of sauce and freeze the excess. When you want to have spaghetti, warm up a portion of the sauce and cook your noodles separately – it will only take a few minutes.
Potatoes typically don't freeze well either. If you enjoy baked or mashed potatoes with your meal, you'll have to make those before you eat rather than trying to make them in advance.
Creamy sauces may separate when frozen and reheated. Prevent this by adding them when you're reheating rather than freezing them with the other food.
Undercook vegetables so reheating won't cause them to become too soft or mushy.

, Even meals that you normally would make for yourself, such as breakfast sandwiches, can be made in larger batches and frozen for your convenience. This way you're not spending as much time every day preparing your food.For example, get some English muffins, eggs, meat, and cheese. Cook your eggs and prepare six or seven breakfast sandwiches at once. This way you spend a few minutes cooking and have a hot breakfast ready every day of the week.
Empanadas and burritos are another option that you can fill with meat, cheese, and vegetables for a handy meal. Once frozen, you can take these with you to work or school for a quick and convenient lunch that won't require eating out at a restaurant.
Unlike prepackaged frozen or fast food versions, the versions you make it home will be much more healthy and packed with vitamins and protein if you use fresh whole foods as your ingredients.

, Casseroles and stews tend to freeze better than individual foods, and have the benefit of being ready to eat as soon as you heat them up without any further preparation.Stir-fry also works well as a one-pot meal. Take out the portion you plan to freeze before it's completely cooked, so you won't ruin the texture of the food when you reheat it at a later time.
The other benefit of one-pot meals is that you reduce the work and clean-up you have to do afterwards. Cook all the ingredients in one pot or pan, then when you heat up individual servings you'll only have one plate to clean.
Cook basic versions of one-pot meals, such as oatmeal, and freeze the excess. Then on a daily basis you can add different fruits or spices so you don't get bored eating the same thing every day.

Highly coloured fruits such as peaches contain carotene, which the body changes into Vitamin A. For the fruit and vegetable group you can include:


apples
oranges or clementines
bananas
berries
pears
peaches
cucumber slices
salad
carrot sticks
bell pepper slices
cauliflower or broccoli;
, Sandwiches are compact, easy to make, and can be quite healthy if you make them correctly. Pick a source of protein, usually either some sliced meat or peanut butter, and then build a sandwich around your protein. try to use wholegrain bread, which is high in fiber.


Use a low-calorie spinach or whole grain wrap instead of bread if your'e trying to stay carb-conscious.
Instead of a bunch of jelly or jam, add honey, raisins, apple, or banana slices to your peanut butter sandwich. Less sugar, plenty of sweet flavor.
If you want to keep the sandwich from getting soggy in your lunch, wrap the ingredients separately and put it together when you're ready to eat. No soggy bread!
Lean turkey or lite tuna is usually better than fattier processed meats like ham, roast beef, or salami. If you want to stay healthy, go with a turkey sandwich.
Go easy on the condiments and the cheese. Aside from making a soggy sandwich, slathering a bunch of mayo on your sandwich adds calories and nothing in the way of nutrition.

, You can get sick of a sandwich pretty quickly. To mix it up, try making up a healthy pasta salad, with mixed vegetables and tuna, or with a variety of other healthy ingredients, you could have a one-box meal that will be easy to eat and offer total nutrition. Check out the following articles to learn more about good grain lunch recipes:

, Salads are easy to put together in the morning, but you can also mix up some wilted salads the night before to let the flavors mingle. Then, in the morning, you can just grab your lunch and go. Start with a base of light greens, like field mix, romaine, or butter lettuce, and add carrots, olives, onion, tomato, and other vegetables to taste.


If you want a great wilted salad, start with a more robust green like kale. Cut into tiny strips and massage the greens with balsamic vinegar and let them sit overnight. They'll be tender and delicious the next day.
Keep salad dressings and any nuts or seeds in a separate container so that the dressing doesn't make the salad soggy and the nuts can stay crunchy.

, It is important to drink plenty of fluids during the day to maintain the balance of bodily fluids. Try to include drinks high in vitamin C and low in sugar to keep yourself hydrated if at all possible. Water and natural fruit juices are usually the best options in the middle of the day.


Avoid soda. Even diet sodas offer you nothing in terms of calories. Excess sugar and caffeine also does more to dehydrate you, instead of keeping you functioning healthy.Likewise, avoid sugary energy drinks and other jolts.
Looking for a creative alternative? Pack a coconut water or a bottle of kombucha. Sweet and tangy, these drinks offer natural nutrition and hydration without the artificial sugars.

,


Vegetable soup is one of the best soups to eat. The combined nutrition of each vegetable adds a great number of vitamins and minerals.
Tomato soup is a great low calorie and low fat food to eat for lunch. It has 0 cholesterol and low carbohydrates. Tomato soup is also an excellent source of lycopene. Lycopene is a powerful antioxidant found in red vegetables.
Minestrone is also very low in carbohydrates and calories. t's made with potatoes, corn, carrots, tomatoes and other healthy vegetables. Like tomato soup, minestrone provides lycopene. Minestrone also adds fiber, protein and iron into your diet.
Try to avoid convenience soups such as instant and canned soups if possible as they contain a lot of salt and flavour enhancers, such as monosodium glutamate. Cartons of fresh fruit are more expensive but are convenient, tasty and nutritious than canned and instant soups.

, Instead of packing a cookie, or a snack bar of some kind, pack a container of healthy yoghurt. Yoghurt helps to promote healthy digestion and can offer a sweet and nutritious complement to the end of the lunch. Pack some slices of fruit to go along with it, if you like.


If you don't like yoghurt, pack some dried fruits, nuts, or other healthy snacks instead of a cookie or a piece of chocolate. If you need a treat, wait until you get home to have one.
Some yoghurts have lots of sugar in them. Real yoghurt doesn't have anything in it but yoghurt and live cultures. Look closely at the ingredients. If you see tapioca starches, sugar, and other strange ingredients, look elsewhere.
Instead of ice cream, mix up some protein powder, peanut butter, and blueberries in a cup of greek yoghurt. Delicious.

, Empty-calorie foods are foods that contain a lot of sugar, but nothing in the way of vitamins, minerals, or fiber. Empty-calorie foods include chocolate bars, cookies, cakes, and especially soda. There's no reason to include highly processed snack foods in your lunch. Focus on lean meats, fresh vegetables and fruits, and avoid the empty stuff.

, Having the same lunch everyday can become boring, even though it's not actually unhealthy. If you want to make eating healthy attractive though, it's good to vary the menu, so you won't be tempted to spring for a package of Pop-Tarts from the vending machine, instead of eating your healthy pasta salad.


Write out a schedule at the beginning of the week and make sure you've bought enough stuff to have a good variety through the week.
When you make dinner, make enough to have leftovers the next day, or the day after. Easy lunch solution.

Choose recipes that are simple to divide.,
Learn equivalencies for difficult divisions.,
Taste test when adding seasonings.,
Pay attention to your pan size.,
Adjust cooking time as necessary.,
Take notes on what you did.",How to Prepare Healthy Meals for One Person2," Recipes with even amounts of ingredients typically are the easiest to reduce if you only want to cook enough for a single meal for yourself. If the ingredient measurements are easily divisible by two or three, you can easily reduce the recipe.For example, if you're halving a recipe that calls for two eggs, you would use one egg. Halving a recipe would be more difficult if the recipe called for three eggs. Though it could still be done, you may want to explore another option or just make the whole recipe and freeze the excess if you don't trust your math skills.
If your recipe calls for a single can or package of something, you may want to measure the food in the container before dividing it, rather than just going by sight. You can save the portion you don't use by freezing it and use it later.

, Don't let complex divisions stop you from reducing a recipe – especially if it's one you really like. Memorize equivalencies for common ingredient measures so you can reduce the recipe appropriately.For example, there are 16 tablespoons in a cup and three teaspoons in one tablespoon. So if you're cutting a recipe into thirds that calls for a quarter-cup of something, you would use one tablespoon and one teaspoon.
The University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources has a PDF table with handy measurements to use when making either one-half or one-third of a recipe. You can look at that table or download and print it at http://food.unl.edu/reducing-size-recipes-0.
Dividing whole foods can be a little more difficult. For example, suppose you want to make half of a recipe that calls for one egg. There's no good way to divide an egg in half. However, you can crack the egg in a separate dish, whip it together with a fork, and then use two tablespoons of it. Save the rest in the fridge and use it for an omelet or scrambled eggs tomorrow.

, With herbs and spices, sometimes a pinch is too much and the small amounts the recipe calls for are virtually impossible to divide. When this happens, add just a tap from the container and taste-test frequently until you get the right balance.Even if you have a total amount, consider that a target. Add gradually and taste frequently until you reach a balance that works for you. It may be less – or even more – than what the recipe calls for.
This is generally a good idea even if you're not reducing a recipe. Seasonings in recipes are more suggestive than they are required ingredients. Feel free to experiment with a recipe and make it the way you like it.

, If you're halving a recipe that calls for a specific size of pan, you want to use a correspondingly smaller pan. Baking it in the larger pan can result in the food burning or not cooking evenly.For example, if you're halving a recipe that calls for a 9 x 2 x 13-inch pan, use an 8 x 2-inch square pan or a 9 x 2-inch round pan.
Overall, you want to focus on having the food be approximately the same depth as it would be in the pan the recipe calls for.
If you're using a glass pan and the recipe calls for a metal pan, reduce the temperature of the oven by 25 degrees Fahrenheit.

, Just because you halve a recipe doesn't necessarily mean you should cut the time it takes to cook in half too. However, smaller quantities typically will be done five to ten minutes sooner than the full amount would have been.Don't leave your food unattended. Set a timer and check it about 10 minutes before the time given on the recipe, and then again at five minutes.
For example, if the recipe calls for a casserole to bake for 20 minutes, check it after 10 minutes and then again after 15 minutes. If it isn't done after 15 minutes, continue checking it every minute.
A food thermometer is a good investment, particularly if you're cooking meats, so you can know for sure when your food is cooked properly.

, Whenever you reduce a recipe, there will be things that you need to adjust to make it come out right. If you write down what you did and make notes as to whether it worked, you can replicate it later.Notes on what doesn't work can be just as valuable as notes on what did – if not more so. Write down carefully what you did and how it didn't work so that you won't repeat the same mistake.
Remember that a lot of cooking is experimentation. If you don't get it right the first time, you can adjust your tactics and get it right the next time around. Your notes will help you.

Read recipes ahead of time.,
Make a list and stick to it.,
Stock up on staples.,
Check unit prices.,
Get cheaper cuts of meat.,
Avoid junk foods in the center aisles.,
Be creative with your leftovers.",How to Prepare Healthy Meals for One Person3," While you may want to shop for basic food so you always have something on hand to make a small meal or a snack, reading recipes allows you to choose your meals and determine exactly what you need to get when you go to the store.For example, the USDA's ChooseMyPlate website plans seven-day and 21-day menus to ensure a variety of healthy meals over the course of the week.
Planning your meals in advance also can be helpful if you plan to make a lot of something all at once and then freeze it for later.
Go over recipes and try to find ones that use different food ingredients but similar herbs and spices, so you don't have to buy a lot of herbs and spices all at once.

, Write down everything you need from your recipes, as well as any additional items that you want to pick up. Once you're at the store, don't pick up or even look at items that aren't on your list.If you've planned your recipes in advance, you also can look for coupons and specials at grocery stores near you. Try downloading an app for your phone that will help you find the best prices for certain items, particularly if they're the more expensive items on your list.
Specify amounts, particularly for perishable items such as meats or fresh vegetables, so you don't get too much and end up wasting it.
Your local farmer's market may be a good place to buy produce, especially if you're looking for fruits or vegetables that are in season where you live.

, Dry goods such as beans and rice have a long shelf life. Provided you have room to store them, you can save money by getting mass quantities of these items so you'll always have them on hand.Cereals and other grains also can be bought in bulk and stored for long periods of time, provided you keep them unopened or in airtight containers.
Whole grains can be good for baking your own breads or making your own oatmeal, which can be cheaper and more healthy than buying packaged or instant varieties.
If your storage is at a premium, only buy as much as you can properly store. A five-pound bag of rice won't save you any money if you end up having to throw away four pounds of it.

, You may assume that everything is cheaper if you buy it in bulk, but that isn't necessarily true. The unit price of an item, typically listed next to the overall price on the grocery store shelf, will tell you what something actually costs.Food frequently is compared by the ounce. So, for example, you might have a regular-sized box of cereal that costs 12 cents per ounce. The larger, family size, on the other hand, costs 10 cents per ounce.
Buy the choice that offers you the lowest price per ounce – keeping in mind that this might not always be the lowest overall price.
Comparing unit prices also gives you a better idea of how much you're actually saving if you buy the ""bargain"" or ""family"" size of something. Frequently the difference is only a penny or two per ounce. If you're concerned the food might go bad before you get to it, you're probably better off getting the smaller size.

, Especially if you're making primarily stews and one-pot meals, there's no need to get a fancy cut of meat. Cheaper cuts taste no different and can save you a lot of money.For example, if you're buying chicken, consider buying thighs. They're cheaper than chicken breasts and provide about three ounces of chicken, which is the perfect individual portion.You also can buy meat in larger packages at a lower price. Freeze what you're not going to cook immediately so you can use it later.

, Grocery stores typically are arranged with the whole foods such as produce, meats, and dairy along the outer perimeter of the store. Start your shopping around the outside of the store, then work your way through the aisles.If you're trying to eat healthy, you probably have little use for junk food. And if you've planned ahead by building your list from ingredients you need to cook healthy meals, you won't have any junk food on your list. This means that in most cases you can avoid those center aisles altogether.
Try to avoid being tempted by sale signs and other promotions. If it isn't on your list, you don't have any need for it.
Don't go to the grocery store when you're hungry, or you may find yourself even more tempted by food packaged so that you can eat it right away, rather than whole foods that you have to cook.
When you've purchased everything on your list, it's time to check out. If you continue to wander around the store after you've gotten everything on your list, you'll be tempted to buy other items.

, Cooking for one often means you have leftovers – but it doesn't mean you have to eat the same meal two or three days in a row. Instead, use your leftovers in other recipes or with other sides so you don't get bored.For example, leftover meat and vegetables can be combined into a hearty vegetable soup or stew.
You can also can throw leftovers into a tortilla and add a little sauce and cheese and give them a second life as a burrito.
Try putting leftovers from two or three different meals together to make a new meal with different ingredients. Even if the sides don't seem like they'd go well together, you may be surprised. If your experiment doesn't work, you don't have to do it again.

Easy cleanup. No matter how carefully you pack, your lunch box will end up with crumbs and spills in it, so think ,when you buy it, think about how easy it will be to wipe or rinse out.;
, You can even plan your lunch menus a week ahead, if you like. Preparing your lunch the night before also means less time is wasted in the morning.

, Aim for a variety each day. Try including:


A main dish, such as a sandwich, soup, salad, or wrap.

, Clean all fruits and vegetables before eating. Wash them under running water and dry them with a clean towel.

, Keep hot foods such as soup, chili or stew hot - 140 °F (60 °C) or above - by using an insulated container. Preheat the thermos with hot water and let stand. Drain the hot water and fill with hot food.

, Use an insulated lunch bag. Metal or plastic lunch boxes and paper bags can also be used. Double sack paper lunch bags to increase their insulation qualities.

, Harmful bacteria multiply rapidly between the temperatures of 40 degrees and 140 °F (60 °C).

, Use a frozen juice pack to keep things cold. Also, freeze sandwiches to help keep them chilled until lunchtime. The sandwiches will be thawed in time for lunch.

, If a refrigerator is available at school, that's the best option to keep food cold.

,, Toss what's left of lunch rather than saving the food for another lunch.

, Consider keeping a supply of shelf-stable foods on hand for easy packing. These include crackers, nuts, dried fruit, peanut butter, packaged pudding and canned fruits or meats.

, Making up the lunch the night before can be a real time saver. Sandwiches should be kept in the refrigerator, or frozen, until time to go in the morning.

, Line up the ingredients assembly line style and make a bunch of sandwiches in bulk. This is much like Once-a-Month cooking where foods are all prepared at once for later use. Freeze the sandwiches for later use.[[Image:Pack a Healthy and Safe Lunch Step 12.jpg}}"

Plan.,
Cover your Breakfasts.,
Snacks.,
Lunches.,
Evening snacks - These can be light fares but aimed at your bottomless leg grazers who never are quite satisfied.,
Dinner is the most important meal but it doesn't have to mean its expensive.,
Desserts.",How to Plan Cooking for People All Weekend," Think about meals in a 3-6 meals a day kind of way, assuming that you may add in, besides the usual breakfast, lunch and dinner, things like snacks and dessert.;
, Now separate out each type of planned meal and plan for each day. Will your guests be there before or after breakfast on Friday. If before, then plan on 3 days of breakfasts. You do not want to prepare the same thing each day, and can allow people options.


Cereal is a staple in many households, but it can get boring and not everyone is lactose tolerant.
Try Eggs and Bacon one morning
Pancakes and sausage is another good option.
Or you can splurge and get donuts as a treat for one morning.

, Lucky for you, fruit has been an adequate snack go-between for the breakfast to lunch scenario.


Get a few varieties that are easy to pop into the mouth or pick up and eat, like melons, apples, grapes, bananas, cherries, Blueberries, Peaches, Nectarines, Plums, Oranges and so many others.

, The sandwich has dominated the scene in America, especially, since the late 1800s. However, this does not have to be your only option.


Day 1: Salads, pizzas, mini-brioches, and crudites are acceptable and good for a small buffet so that people can have options.
Day 2: Make your own sandwiches
Day 3: Try to pick out something adventurous or different but allow for both carnivorous and vegetarian options as your guests may have a preference. There are so many cultures in the world that you can borrow from, like Sushi from Japan or Pad Thai dishes with Noodles from Thailand, or Curry (Available with any meat option) from India, and so many more.

, Keep a small tray or plate loaded with:


a dip of choice (French Onion, or Onion and Chives or Ranch are common)
plenty of cut up vegetables like celery which is cheap, carrots, again cheap, and things that are crisp like cucumbers, green/red/orange/yellow bell peppers, and broccoli and cauliflower. Add in a few olives (your choice of green or black) and you've got a grazer's paradise.
Present it with nuts one night,
potato chips another night and
tortilla chips with salsa the final night.

, Are your guests with kids or without? If will, keep mini-corn dogs and chicken tenders available for the first 2 nights. If without kids, plan your meals to cater to your audiences.


Grilling meats and kabobs one night will satisfy the new guests and add in American favorites like beans and chips or mac n cheese. Corn on the cob is always a treat and a salad will cover your greens, but make it colorful.
Do a pasta dish one night and offer both red and white sauces.
On your final night, select a dish that covers all your favorite meal options to give your guests a view of life from your perspective, but do it up. You want the last meal they have with you to be both filling and memorable.

, Now comes the easy part. Desserts are something that everyone has an opinion about but also has the most variety.


Cookies,
cakes,
pies,
ice creams,
popsicles,
cremes,
puddings, and so much more are available. The hard part will be in narrowing down the options enough to not overdo it and overwhelm your guests and their sweet tooth.

Buy raw bratwurst from a grocery store.,
Buy pre-cooked bratwurst from a grocery store.,
Make your own bratwurst.,
Buy enough bratwurst.",How to Cook Bratwurst1," There are many different kinds of bratwurst on the market. Traditional German bratwurst is typically named for the region from which it comes. These vary depending on thickness, length, coloring and flavor.Some of the more well-known bratwurst include:


Coburger Bratwurst
Fränkische Bratwurst
Kulmbacher Bratwurst
Nürnberger Rostbratwurst
Nordhessische Bratwurst
Rote Wurst
Thüringer Rostbratwurst
Würzburger Bratwurst;
, Butcher shops are great places to buy raw meat. Ask the butcher where the bratwurst came from and the ingredients used to make it. Visit a reputable, clean butcher shop. Make sure the butcher wraps up your bratwurst in butcher paper.


Some butchers may be able to special-order certain types of meats. If there is a certain kind of bratwurst you are looking for, you may be able to request it., Most groceries stores sell raw bratwurst. Some are specialty brands that are fairly expensive, while others are more common brands. They may have special flavors, seasonings or stuffings.

, Pre-cooked bratwurst is readily available at grocery stores and is usually available in packages of 6-8 sausages. This kind may be smoked or otherwise seasoned with spices.

, Making your own bratwurst can be a great way to customize the ingredients and flavors in your bratwurst. This is a time-consuming process, however, that requires equipment such as a meat grinder and sausage stuffer. In addition, you need sausage casings and room to dry and store the sausages. See the wikiHow article, “Make Homemade Sausage.”

, Plan on at least one brat per person. Many people will likely want second helpings, so buying extra is usually a good idea."
"
Put water and bratwurst in a pot or deep pan.,
Boil the bratwurst for about 20 minutes.,
Throw them on the grill to finish cooking if desired.,
Check the internal temperature.",How to Cook Bratwurst2," Make sure your pan is deep enough that the brats will be covered in water. Place the bratwurst in the pan. Try to not let them overlap. Giving more room is better for cooking the bratwurst.


Alternately, you can add half water and half beer to the pan for added flavor.

, Turn the pan to medium-high heat and let the water heat up to a boil. Once it gets to a boil, turn down the heat so that it doesn’t overboil or ruin the bratwurst. If you boil the sausage at a slower, gentler boil, you will have better bratwurst.If you are cooking pre-cooked bratwurst, you just need to heat them up, rather than making sure they are cooked through as you would with raw bratwurst.

, Grilling the brats will help finish them off and give them a nice flavor. Put them on the grill with a pair of tongs and grill them for 5-10 minutes, turning them over at least once to make sure they cook on both sides. They will be browned from the grill and ready to serve.


You can also grill your brats first for 5-10 minutes on each side, and then boil them. If you do this process, boil them for about 20 minutes after grilling., Check the internal temperature of the bratwurst by using a meat thermometer and making sure the brats are about 160 °F (71 °C).

Chop 1 onion.,
Melt butter in a pan with a heavy bottom.,
Add the onions.,
Add bratwurst to the pan.,
Add beer to the pan.,
Finish off the brats on the grill.,
Remove the brats from the grill.",How to Cook Bratwurst3," In order to poach bratwurst in beer, you will need to assemble your ingredients and have everything on hand before you start. You will need:


Bratwurst: use as many as will fit into your pan or as many as you plan to serve
One medium-sized white, yellow or sweet onion
6 ounces of dark beer

, Use 1 medium-sized white, yellow or sweet onion. Chop the onion into rings. These will cook with the bratwurst, giving a nice flavor and companion to the sausage.

, Use either a heavy skillet or a Dutch oven to cook the brats and onions. Turn the burner on a medium high heat. Melt about 1 tablespoon of butter and make sure the butter covers the entire bottom of the pan., Brown the onions in the butter for 1-2 minutes. Stir them frequently to make sure they are browned on all sides.


Some recipes suggest cooking the onions after you cook the bratwurst, so that you can monitor the bratwurst more effectively and so that you don’t risk overcooking the onions., Cook the bratwurst with the onion for 2 minutes. Then turn over the bratwurst using tongs and let them cook for another 2 minutes. Both sides should be nicely browned.

, Slowly pour 6 ounces of dark beer (about half a regular sized bottle) into the pan. Cover the pan with a lid. Turn down the burner’s heat to medium to medium-low. Allow this to cook with the bratwurst and onions for approximately 15 minutes. The beer will poach the bratwurst, adding good flavor to the sausage.

, Remove the brats from the pan using a pair of tongs, and put them on a plate. Transfer them to a pre-heated grill. Let them cook for 5-7 minutes, turning them over at least once halfway through the cooking time.

, Take the brats off the grill with tongs and place them on a serving plate. Dish up the onions on the same plate.


Alternately, you can use a casserole dish or the Dutch oven to serve the bratwurst.

Don’t use extremely high heat.,
Don’t use very low heat.,
Use a disposable aluminum pan to poach bratwurst first.,
Place the brats on the grill.,
Don’t crowd the bratwurst together.,
Spritz the bratwurst with water or beer.,
Remove the brats from the grill.",How to Cook Bratwurst4," Your bratwurst will probably char and crack open if you place them on the highest possible heat immediately. Furthermore, they will probably still be raw in the middle. Give them a chance to heat up a little more slowly on the grill., If you use very low heat and try to cook the bratwurst, you might get overcooked interior meat. In addition to having to cook it for a long time, the bratwurst might look like it’s done on the outside but has cooked too long. It will shrivel up when it cools., Use the heat of the grill to poach the bratwurst before putting them directly on the grill. Get a disposable aluminum pan at the grocery store.


Put your bratwurst in these, along with some chopped onion, red or green peppers, or other vegetables. You can also put a bed of sauerkraut in the bottom of the aluminum pan.
Pour some beer over the brats (about 6 ounces) and let this simmer with the grill lid down for about 15 minutes. Check the internal temperature of the brats with a meat thermometer. They should be about 160 °F (71 °C).
Remove the brats and place them directly on the grill for about 5-7 minutes. Be sure to turn them over about halfway through the grilling time.

, Use a medium setting heat on the grill. Let the brats cook for a few minutes on one side. Turn them over and let them cook for a few more minutes. If you have not poached or boiled the brats before grilling them, then you’ll need to grill them for about 25 minutes total. Be sure to turn them over a few times while they cook to ensure they are cooked on all sides.


Do not poke holes in the bratwurst, as this will let all the juice escape from the casing and result in a dry bratwurst.

, If there are too many bratwurst on the grill, you raise the potential for causing a flare-up or grease fire. Spread out the bratwurst and give them some room to cook.

, As the bratwurst are cooking, you can spritz them with water or beer to keep them from burning. Put water or beer in a spray bottle. Carefully and quickly spray the liquid over the bratwurst. Alternately, you can brush water or beer on them with a pastry brush., Use a pair of tongs to remove the brats and place them on a plate. Do not use the same plate that held the raw bratwurst, so that you don’t risk cross-contamination. Check the internal temperature with a meat thermometer to make sure they are around 160 °F (71 °C).

Grow your own herbs.,
Shop for herbs at the farmer's market.,
Buy herbs online.,
Share the herbs you buy with friends.,
Keep your herbs alive and fresh as long as possible.",How to Save Money On Herbs1," Seeds cost less than fresh herbs and herb plants.


Plant your favorite herbs in your garden, a container or a small pot. If you have no outdoor space, start a windowsill garden or a kitchen herb garden with just a very small investment.;
, You can probably find locally grown herbs for less money at farmer's markets and produce stands.

, Whether you want to buy fresh herbs, herb plants or seeds to grow, shopping online can offer you a larger selection and more competitive prices.


Look for sites that provide free or discounted shipping. You do not want to spend the money you are saving on the herbs on large shipping charges.
Buy other products such as herbal supplements and teas online as well.

, If you prefer fresh herbs over dried but you know you will not use an entire package or plant, swap with other people.


Make a trade. For example, if you buy a package of fresh rosemary stems and your neighbor buys a basil plant, give half of your rosemary in exchange for a few leaves of basil so that you do not buy more than you will use.

,


Trim the stems and place the herbs in a glass of water. Change the water every 1 or 2 days.
Wrap your fresh herbs in a moist paper towel and place them in a plastic bag that you can seal. Store them in the refrigerator and they will stay fresh for several days.

, Make sure there is a little room around each brat. Line them up to be perpendicular to the grates on the broiler pan.


You can also use a cast-iron skillet instead of a broiler pan.Be sure to rotate the brats every 5 minutes to prevent them burning on one side.

, Place the broiler pan on an oven rack and close the oven. Let the brats cook for about 5 minutes., After 5 minutes have passed, open the oven and use an oven mitt to hold onto the broiler pan. Use tongs to turn over each brat. Put the pan back in the oven for another 5 minutes, and then turn the brats again. Cook the bratwurst for a total of 15-20 minutes.


If you don’t rotate your brats, you will risk burning them.

, Use a meat thermometer and poke into one bratwurst so that the tip of the thermometer rests in the middle of the bratwurst. It should reach 160 °F (71 °C).

Heat up your smoker.,
Use tongs to place bratwurst inside the smoker.,
Smoke the bratwurst for 2 to 2.5 hours.,
Check the bratwurst’s internal temperature.,
Remove the bratwurst.",How to Cook Bratwurst7," Smoking meats is a very different process from grilling on a barbecue or cooking on a stove. Smoking involves lower temperatures and longer cooking times. Heat up your smoker to about 200 °F (93 °C). Follow your manufacturer’s instructions to get the smoker ready for use, such as adding water and smoke flavoring.

Some people like to cook bratwurst at a higher temperature, such as 250 °F (121 °C), while others aim for a much lower temperature, starting at 100F for an hour, then raising to 125F and 150F. These lower temperatures will mean it will take you much longer to cook the brats.
Hickory or applewood smoke is a good flavor for smoked bratwurst.

, Line up the bratwurst inside the smoker and be sure to give each wurst a little room. Be careful not to puncture or tear the casings on each brat.

Brats will cook more slowly on the bottom rack than on the top rack., Leave the smoker to cook the bratwurst for 2 to 2.5 hours. You don’t need to flip over the bratwurst halfway through. Rather, leave them alone for at least 2 hours. Every time the door to the smoker opens, the smoker loses a little heat and you’ll have to cook a little longer.

Adjust your cooking time if you are smoking at a lower temperature than 200F.

, After about 2 hours, use a meat thermometer to check the temperature of the bratwurst. The bratwurst should reach 160 °F (71 °C).

It’s best to use the same bratwurst every time to check the temperature. Every time you puncture it with a thermometer, some juices will escape and will make that bratwurst less than perfect.

, Use tongs to take the bratwurst out of the smoker. Set them on a plate. Be sure to use a different plate than the one you may have used to load them in. You want to avoid cross-contamination between raw bratwurst and cooked bratwurst."

Let stand before serving.",How to Cook Buckwheat1," Add the butter to a large, heavy-bottomed skillet and heat it over medium-high heat until the butter melts.


If using oil instead of butter, you should still give the oil a few minutes to warm up before adding anything else to the skillet. The oil should become notably glossy and easier to spread around the bottom of the pan once it is ready, but it should not begin to smoke.;
, Add the buckwheat and toast, stirring frequently, until the grains are coated and slightly deeper in color. This should take about 2 to 3 minutes.


You need to stir the buckwheat constantly as it cooks. Otherwise, the grains can start to burn pretty quickly.

, Slowly pour the liquid into the pan and bring it to a boil. If using water, add salt, as well.


The liquid you choose should be determined based on how you plan to serve the buckwheat. If using it for breakfast, stick with plain water. If using it as a side for lunch or dinner, consider using broth, instead.

, Reduce heat to medium-low or low and cover. Cook until the liquid is absorbed.The buckwheat will not be completely dry. It should look moist and sticky, but any remaining moisture should cling thickly to the buckwheat instead of laying in a puddle at the bottom of the pan.

, Remove the buckwheat from the heat and let it stand for 5 minutes before serving.


This method produces a creamy buckwheat that can be used as cereal or grits.

, Place the buckwheat in the mixing bowl with the egg and stir well, making sure that each grain is coated with beaten egg.


Even though egg usually binds ingredients together, in this recipe, the egg actually helps the individual groats to remain separate by lending them a coating that prevents them from breaking down together as they cook. As such, it is important the the groats are coated as thoroughly and evenly as possible.

, Warm a nonstick skillet over medium heat and add the buckwheat mixture. Stir the mixture continuously until the mixture is dry.


This can take anywhere from 2 to 5 minutes.
When done, the grains should still be relatively separate from one another instead of being clumpy.

, Slowly pour the liquid into a separate medium saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat.


The liquid you choose should be determined based on how you plan to serve the buckwheat. If using it for breakfast, stick with plain water. If using it as a side for lunch or dinner, consider using broth, instead.

, Reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan.

, When done, the liquid should be fully absorbed.


With this method, the contents of the pan should be fairly dry when done, and there should not be any sticky moisture clinging to the buckwheat groats.

, Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the buckwheat stand for 5 minutes before using it.


After preparing buckwheat with this method, the grains should be light and separated. They will be suitable as a substitute for cooked rice in most recipes.

Transfer to the prepared square baking pan.,
Cook until golden brown.,
Add the coconut and dried fruit.,
Cool completely before serving.",How to Cook Buckwheat3," Lightly coat a 9-inch by 9-inch (23-cm by 23-cm) square baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.

, Place the oats, almonds, buckwheat, and sunflower seeds in a bowl and stir well to distribute evenly. Add the canola oil, honey, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla extract to the mixture and continue stirring until all the grains, nuts, and seeds are coated well.


Do not add the coconut or the dried fruit yet.
Stir the ingredients together using a wooden mixing spoon or spatula.
Note that if you combine the ingredients in an oven-safe glass or metal bowl, you do not need to use a separate square baking dish. Instead, the granola can be cooked in the bowl itself.

, Pour the granola into your baking dish, spreading it out evenly and patting it down gently yet firmly.

, This can take over an hour depending on how tightly packed the granola is. You will need to keep an eye on it every 15 minutes or so after the first 30 minutes.


Additionally, you should stir the granola every 30 minutes with a wooden mixing spoon.If you do not, some of the granola may cook while other sections of it may not.

, After pulling the granola out of the oven, stir in the coconut and dried fruit if you decide to add them. These additional elements should be thoroughly distributed throughout the mixture.


The coconut and dried fruit will end up becoming lightly toasted once you stir them into the hot ingredients. Since the coconut and fruit are both more sensitive than the other ingredients, it is better to toast them this way than alongside the rest of the granola, since the fruit and coconut will burn before the other ingredients finish cooking.

, Stir the granola every 30 minutes or so as it cools. After it cools completely, it is ready to enjoy or to save.


Note that the granola will end up sticking to the bottom of the pan and sticking together in clusters as it cools. This will happen regardless of how often you stir it, but stirring it as it cools will prevent the whole thing from sticking together.
If saving the granola, place it in an airtight jar and keep it for a week or so.

Combine the cooked buckwheat with eggs, breadcrumbs, onions, and garlic.,
Form patties.,
Cook patties until browned.,
Serve warm.",How to Cook Buckwheat4," Add the butter to a large heavy-bottomed skillet and heat on medium-high until melted.


If using oil instead of butter, you should still give the oil a few minutes to warm up before adding anything else to the skillet. The oil should become notably glossy and easier to spread around the bottom of the pan once it is ready, but it should not begin to smoke.

, Add the buckwheat to the butter in the skillet and toast, stirring continuously, for 2 to 3 minutes. The grains should be completely coated and lightly toasted.


You need to stir the buckwheat constantly as it cooks. Otherwise, the grains can start to burn pretty quickly.

, Slowly pour the chicken broth into the pan and let it come to a boil.

, Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover the pan, and let the buckwheat cook until the broth is completely absorbed.


After you finish cooking the buckwheat, remove it from the heat and let it cool for 5 minutes before proceeding further.

, Transfer the cooked buckwheat to a medium mixing bowl. Add the other ingredients to the same bowl and mix thoroughly with a wooden mixing spoon or clean hands.


If desired, you should also add the salt and pepper to the mixture now. The amount of salt and pepper you add is mostly a matter of personal taste.

, Use your hands to form the buckwheat mixture into four to six patties. These patties should be large enough to serve on a bun.


Make sure to pack the patties together firmly. The egg acts as a binding ingredient in this recipe, so it should help hold the patties in the form you give them.

, Coat a skillet with nonstick cooking spray and add the patties. Cook for 2 to 4 minutes on each side, or until both sides are lightly browned on both sides and the patties are heated through.


Set the heat to medium-high.
Before you cook the patties, it might be helpful to let the the cooking spray heat up for a minute or so.

, The patties can be dressed as you would dress standard hamburgers. You can add cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles, mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise, or any other condiment or topping you would usually add to a burger.

Choose leaner cuts of protein.,
Serve fruits and vegetables as side dishes.,
Use 100% whole grains.,
Pack a lighter dessert.,
Always pack water.,
Limit creamy sauces and dressings.,
Skip the chips and crackers.,
Limit alcohol intake.,
Make your own fruit kebabs.,
Serve homemade pomegranate soda.,
Bring along homemade garlic hummus and veggies.,
Make a grilled chicken and quinoa salad.",How to Pack a Healthier Picnic," Depending on what you're bringing for your picnic, you should consider choosing leaner cuts of protein. This can help save on total calories and fat.


The leaner and lower calorie protein choices include: lean beef, poultry, seafood, nuts, beans, tofu and low-fat dairy products. Try low-sodium deli meats, chicken salad made with Miracle Whip (as opposed to mayo), hummus dip instead of ranch, string cheese, a salmon wrap, potato salad with herb vinaigrette (instead of mayo), etc.
Also measure the portion sizes of your protein. Whether you're making sandwiches or burgers, keep your total calorie intake in check by sticking to an appropriate portion size. Weigh out 3 – 4 oz or measure out about 1/2 cup per serving of protein.If you're grilling out for your picnic, be careful about what you choose to grill. For example, choose the 93/7 ground beef to help save on total fat for your burgers. Or consider using ground turkey instead. Grill chicken breast instead of bringing fried chicken, or choose turkey or chicken sausage over pork sausage or hot dogs.
If you're packing sandwiches, use low-sodium and all natural deli meat with low-fat cheese.;
, You can save a lot of calories and really boost the overall nutrition of your picnic by serving fruits and vegetables. These can act as a great nutritious side dishes.


Both fruits and vegetables are naturally lower in calories, but very high in vitamins, minerals and fiber. Adding these to any picnic can help make it a little healthier.You still need to measure out the portions of these foods as well. Whether you make a fruit salad or a tossed salad, stick to 1/2 cup of fruit, 2 cups of salad or 1 cup of vegetables per serving.Great side dish ideas include: fruit salad, a tossed green salad, sliced cantaloupe wrapped with prosciutto, sliced tomatoes with low-fat mozzarella or a broccoli and cauliflower salad.

, Picnics also typically contain at least one or more grains. Whether it's the sandwich bread, hamburger buns, or crackers, grains make up a big part of picnic foods.


To boost the nutrition of grains, choose 100% whole grains. These are higher in fiber, protein and other essential minerals compared to more refined grains (like white rice or white bread).Whole grains should be measured as well. Measure out 1 oz or about a 1/2 cup of grains. Choose 100% whole grains like: whole grain bread, whole wheat pasta, brown rice, or quinoa.
If you're going to make burgers or sandwiches, choose 100% whole grain breads, rolls or even wraps. You can also find white whole grain items that can help little kids be more willing to try these nutritious foods.
Whole grains can also make a great side dish. You can do a quinoa and roasted vegetable salad, tabbouleh, or toss barley or farro in with a kale salad.

, It's nice to be able to lounge in the warm weather and enjoy a sweet ending to your picnic. Try to choose desserts that aren't overly loaded with sugar and fat.


Just because you want to pack a healthier picnic, this doesn't mean that you have to skip dessert. You can still enjoy a sweet treat without blowing your whole meal.
Think of foods that are naturally sweet that are also nutritious. Fruit, yogurt and even whole grains can come together for a healthier and lighter picnic treat.
Try to avoid common picnic desserts like: pie, ice pops, brownies, cookies or s'mores.
Instead, make your own desserts and choose something that is fruit based. Fruit is naturally sweet, contains natural sugar and is lower in calories.
For example, you can serve vanilla yogurt with sliced fruit and a sprinkle of cinnamon or grill pineapples or peaches for a super sweet ending to your picnic.
If you want to treat yourself to something a little more indulgent, go for a mini sized dessert. Make mini cupcakes or mini pies to keep the portion size small.

, In addition to all the great nutritious food you'll pack, don't forget about the beverages. Stick to hydrating fluids that aren't loaded with sugar and added calories.


Many popular summer drinks contain more sugar and calories than you'd think. Whether it's lemonade, sodas, fruit punch or a mixed drink, these items can tip the scales in terms of calories.
Instead, stick to clear hydrating fluids. Water, sparkling water, unsweetened iced tea or flavored waters are great options.
If you want to make something more special, consider making infused waters and homemade ""sodas."" Infuse water overnight with your favorite blend of sliced fruit, vegetables and herbs (like strawberry basil or cucumber and orange). Homemade ""sodas"" are simply made by adding in 1/4 cup of 100% fruit juice with 8 oz of seltzer water.

, Probably the most popular and common group of picnic foods are those that have creamy dressings and sauces. Although tasty, these contain a ton of calories and fat.Common picnic foods that fall into this category are: coleslaw, potato salad, macaroni salad, meat salads (like tuna salad or egg salad), and dips (like ranch dip or buffalo chicken dip).
The mayonnaise, sour cream, full-fat buttermilk and sugar are what tip the scales in terms of total calories.
Instead of these high-calorie items, try swapping them out for something lower in calories. You can try using plain yogurt or Miracle Whip instead of mayo or using light sour cream and buttermilk.

, Grabbing a bag of prepackaged chips and crackers is an easy side for your picnic; however, these foods are also highly processed and can be high in calories as well.


The plus side of grabbing a bag of chips or box of crackers is that these foods are shelf stable. They won't go bad in the heat and don't need to be refrigerated; however, one serving of chips can be over 150 calories (and there are usually many servings in a bag).Limit items like: potato chips, buttery crackers, cheese puffs, nacho chips, party mixes or pita chips.
If you do want to choose a bag of chips or crackers, go for 100% whole grain items. Baked corn chips, whole wheat pita crisps or whole wheat crackers are better than potato chips or buttery crackers.
However, the best bet would be to serve dips like hummus, ranch dip or even guacamole with sliced raw vegetables.

, Alcoholic beverages are another common part of picnics. Although tasty and fun, limit these higher calorie drinks in favor of calorie-free liquids.


Health professionals recommend that you should limit your total alcohol consumption to a max of one serving per day if you are a woman and two if you are a man. One serving is 12 oz of beer, 5 oz of wine, or 1.5 oz of liquor. Stick to the recommended servings if you decide to drink at the picnic.Also, choose alcoholic beverages without a lot of added calories or sugar. For example, mixed drinks or sangria are higher in calories and sugar since they are generally mixed with fruit juices.
If you drink, try a lower calorie beer or red wine; however, the best beverage choice is water, sparkling water or unsweetened iced tea.

, A fun and very nutritious item you can bring on your picnic are fruit kebabs. Let everyone make their own so it's a fun and interactive dish.Before you leave for your picnic, prepare the ingredients for the kebabs. Count out two wooden skewers per person. Also, cut up the following fruits into 2"" pieces: pineapple, grapes (don't need to be cut), watermelon, cantaloupe, and strawberries. You can change the fruit based on your preferences.
Place all the cut fruit in a sealed container and keep refrigerated until you're ready to make the skewers.
You can serve the kebabs plain, but its nice to serve with a sauce. Mix together 1 cup of low-fat vanilla greek yogurt, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and a drizzle of honey. Stir to combine and then store in the refrigerator until ready to use.
Have everyone make their own kebabs and then dip their kebabs into the yogurt sauce.

, If you want to bring along a more exciting beverage in addition to water, consider making your own homemade fruit sodas.


Because this drink will loose its fizzy quality, do not prepare the sodas until you are ready to consume them.
Chill a bottle of 100% pomegranate juice (or another favorite 100% juice) and a bottle of sparkling water or seltzer.
Mix in about 1/4 cup of the pomegranate juice with 6 – 8 oz of the sparkling or seltzer water.
Add in a few ice cubes and a few pomegranate seeds for decoration. Serve immediately.

, Skip the chips and dip in favor of hummus and veggies. High in fiber and protein and low in calories, this is a great dish to bring on a picnic.Make your hummus before going to the picnic. Store in an airtight container until you're ready to serve.
In the bowl of a food processor, add in one can of drained chick peas, one clove of garlic, 1/4 cup of olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and 2 tablespoons of tahini or peanut butter (tahini is a little expensive and sometimes hard to find).
Process the hummus until smooth and creamy. Scrape down the sides of the processor and taste to adjust for seasonings.
Slice some of your favorite vegetables to serve along with your hummus. You can serve baby carrots, cut celery, cucumber slices or sliced bell peppers.

, Instead of sandwiches, burgers or fried chicken, make a healthier main course for your picnic. Start with a quinoa and grilled chicken salad full of vegetables.


Prep this salad ahead of time so that all the flavors can come together before you serve it at the picnic.
In a large bowl, combine the following: 2 cups of cooked quinoa, 1 cup chopped grilled chicken breast, 1/2 cup of sliced green onions, 1 cup of halved grape tomatoes, 1 cup of diced cucumber and 1/2 cup of roughly chopped basil.
In a small bowl, make the dressing. Pour in 1/2 cup of olive oil, 1/4 cup of lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of dijon mustard, one minced garlic clove, 1 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Whisk together until combined.
Pour the dressing over the salad (as much as you'd like) and stir until thoroughly combined. Taste and adjust for seasonings. Keep salad refrigerated until ready to serve at your picnic.

Toss the asparagus with oil before serving.",How to Cook Asparagus on the Stove," Rinse the asparagus under cool to lukewarm running water. Gently scrub the spears with your fingers to remove any excess dirt.


Alternatively, place the asparagus in a colander and rinse the entire bunch at once. Gently shake the colander as you work to stir the spears and loosen any dirt.;
, Remove the woody, white bottom portion of each spear by snapping or cutting it.


To break the end off by hand, firmly hold the asparagus spear in one hand, approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the end of the white section. Grasp onto the white end with your other hand and yank it in a downward movement.
To cut the end off, use a sharp serrate knife and saw at the spear just above the end of the white portion.

, Use a serrated knife to cut the asparagus spears into 2-inch (5-cm) sections, slicing each spear at a slight angle., Fill a large pot with roughly 2 inches (5 cm) of water. Set it to boiling on the stovetop over medium-high heat.


Do not use too much water. You need to use enough water to create steam, but you do not want the water to touch the asparagus or the bottom of the colander.

, Make sure to use a colander that can rest on the brim of the pot.


A colander that dips down into the pot is ideal, but make sure that it does not touch the bottom of the pot or the water inside.
A small wire basket, like the basket of a deep fryer, can also be used in place of the colander as long as the basket is made of food-grade metal.
Do not use another pot. The container you rest the asparagus in must have holes in the bottom to allow steam to rise through.

, Cover it with the lid of the pot.


Use aluminum foil if you do not have a lid or if the lid will not fit securely over the colander. Pinch the foil around the colander to create a seal. Otherwise, steam may escape through the cover.

, This will typically take anywhere from 5 to 6 minutes.


Do not remove the cover as the asparagus cooks. The steam needs to remain trapped inside.

, Lift the lid off the pot and colander, stepping back slightly to prevent yourself from getting burned by the steam. Remove the colander and dump the asparagus out onto a serving dish.


Use oven mitts when lifting the colander out to prevent burns.
Use tongs to remove the aluminum foil if you used foil instead of a lid.
Season with oil and salt, if desired. Sprinkle the salt over the asparagus in the serving dish and toss with heat-resistant serving spoons to coat.

, Add the oil to the skillet before placing it on the stove. Heat the oil over medium-high heat for one to two minutes.


You can also use butter or another type of vegetable oil in place of the olive oil.
Use a wok, if you have one available. A frying pan with low sides is better than one with tall sides.

, Dump the asparagus into the pan, adding the pieces slowly to prevent the oil from splashing on you. Cook, stirring constantly, for roughly 3 to 5 minutes.Use a heat-resistant flat spatula to stir the pieces of asparagus.
It is important to stir the asparagus to prevent the pieces from burning and sticking to the bottom of the pan.
The asparagus should be tender-crisp when done. Stick a fork into the largest, thickest piece. If it goes through, the asparagus is ready. Do not allow the pieces to become soggy, however.

, Sprinkle the pieces with salt and continue stirring to distribute the seasoning evenly.

, Turn the heat off and transfer the asparagus to a serving dish.


Use a slotted spatula or slotted serving spoon to drain away excess oil as you transfer the asparagus.
Alternatively, drain the oil by pouring the contents of the pan into a colander. If you do not have a colander, hold the lid of the pan over the pan itself, leaving a small gap on one side. Pour the oil through that gap and into a sink.

, Fill the saucepan halfway with water and boil it over medium-high heat.


Allow the water to reach a rolling boil. Large bubbles should appear to ""roll"" along the surface of the water.
Do not overfill the saucepan. Filling the pan too high can cause the water to boil out and splash on the stove or on your skin.
Do not fill the saucepan will too little water. You need enough water to completely cover the asparagus once you add it.
You can also use a large saucepan, but the larger the pot, the longer it will take to boil the water and the more difficult it will be to regulate the temperature.

, Adding salt to the water prior to cooking the asparagus allows you to flavor the asparagus as it cooks.


Alternatively, the salt can be added to the asparagus after it cooks, but the asparagus itself will have less flavor.

, Reduce the heat to medium or medium-low until the water bubbles, but no longer boils rapidly. Cook for 2 minutes.


Pour the asparagus pieces into the water slowly and gently to prevent boiling water from splashing onto you.
Start the time as soon as all of the asparagus is added. Do not wait for the temperature of the water to drop before timing it.

, Pour the contents of the saucepan through a colander to drain the asparagus.

, Transfer the asparagus to a serving dish and add the olive oil. Toss it with two large serving spoons to coat.


Butter or other types of vegetable oil may also be used.
If salting the asparagus after it cooks, add the salt as you add the oil.

When the ingredients become the texture of breadcrumbs, turn on the food processor and slowly add the cold water to create a pastry ball.If you don’t have a food processor, combine the salt, butter, and flour in a large bowl. Use a pastry knife to blend the ingredients until they become like breadcrumbs. Add the water gradually and use the pastry knife to bring the pastry together into a ball.

, Dust a flat surface with a light sprinkling of flour. Turn the pastry ball out onto the flour. Knead the pastry for about a minute, until all the ingredients are incorporated and the pastry is a smooth ball. Wrap the ball in a layer of plastic wrap and transfer it to the refrigerator for 15 minutes.

Resting the pastry will give the gluten time to relax, and this will make for a light and fluffy pastry.

, Pour the oil into a large saucepan. Heat the pan over medium heat. When the oil is shimmering, add the onion and carrot. Cook the vegetables for five minutes, stirring regularly.

For added flavor and texture, add ⅛ cup (10 g) of chopped porcini mushrooms to the pan and cook them with the onions and carrots., Transfer the ground beef to the hot saucepan with the carrots and onions. Let the meat cook for about five minutes. Flip the meat with a spatula and cook for another three to five minutes, until the meat is browned. Sprinkle in the remaining tablespoon (8 g) of flour. Stir the mixture and cook for two minutes.The flour will help thicken the juices from the meat and vegetables.

, In a medium bowl, whisk together the tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, beef stock, salt, and pepper. Pour this mixture into the saucepan with the meat and vegetables. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, remove the pan from the heat and set it aside.

To make a beef, ale, and onion pie, replace half the beef stock with dark ale., Divide the pastry into quarters. On a floured surface, roll out the pastry quarters one at a time. You want all four of the pastry quarters to be rolled out into circles with a 9.5-inch (24-cm) diameter., Grease two 9-inch (23-cm) pie plates with butter or shortening. Line each pie plate with a pastry circle. Use a slotted spoon to divide the meat filling evenly between the two pies. Use a pastry brush to brush the beaten egg onto the edges of the pie shell. Lay one pastry circle over each pie.

To seal the pastry, pinch the edges together with your finger or a fork.
It’s important to use a slotted spoon for the meat, because you don’t want too much of the sauce in the pies. Too much sauce will make the pies soggy., Preheat the oven to 350 F (177 C). Brush the top of each pie with more of the beaten egg. Place the pies on a large baking sheet. Bake the pies for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown.Place each pie on a separate baking sheet if they don’t fit on one.

, Remove the pies from the oven. Set them aside to cool for about 10 minutes.Cut each pie into halves to serve four people. To serve eight people, cut each pie into quarters and serve with potatoes, vegetables, or another dish on the side."

Locate the string/stem side of the pod. Snap the tip, peeling the string away in the process.
Continue peeling away the string down the length of the pod until you reach the very end, then use your fingers to pry open the pod along the newly exposed seam.
Pluck the individual beans out of the pod using your fingers. Most mature pods will contain four to eight beans.;
, Bring 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water to a boil in a small saucepan, then place a steamer basket over the top of the pan.

Ideally, the steamer basket should be wide enough to fit the beans in a single layer.
Make sure that the boiling water does not touch the bottom of the steamer basket. Only the steam should be allowed to reach the basket.

, Toss the beans into the basket. Cover the steamer and gently cook the beans for 30 to 60 seconds, or until the outer coating of each bean starts to shrivel.Once the coating shrivels, you should remove the basket of beans from the steamer and allow them to cool for several minutes, just until they are cool enough to handle with your bare hands.

, Peel away the shriveled skin from each fava bean.

Carefully pinch the end of each bean, grabbing the skin without grabbing the bean itself. The inner bean should pop out when you do this.
Keep the inner beans and discard the waxy coatings.

, Return the beans to the steamer basket, and return the steamer basket to your saucepan of boiling water.

Rinse and dry the spinach.,
Cut the spinach if you wish.,
Saute the spinach in a skillet.,
Try boiling your spinach.,
Steam the spinach.",How to Cook Baby Spinach1," Fill a bowl or clean sink with your fresh baby spinach and enough cool, clean water to cover it. Swish the spinach around to clean it, then remove it to dry with a towel.After moving the spinach around in the water, avoid further agitation so that any dirt removed from the leaves can settle to the bottom.
Remove the spinach by hand or with tongs after washing so that you can dispose of the dirty water. Repeat if necessary.
You can dry the spinach in a salad spinner if you have one, but patting it dry on a clean towel or paper towel should be all that is necessary to remove most excess water.;
, Remove the stems of the leaves if you prefer not to eat them, and cut the leaves into pieces if you wish or if your recipe calls for it.


The stems are perfectly edible, but can be slightly tougher or stringier than the leaves when eating. If you cook down your spinach to a soft texture, you will likely not even notice this difference.
In addition to any cutting, the baby spinach will reduce its size on its own when cooking.

, Place your rinsed and dried baby spinach into a skillet or other pan and stir or turn until it is cooked evenly. You may cover the pan with a lid for faster cooking.


Saute the spinach over medium heat. You may add oil or butter first, but the water content of the spinach will quickly be released and prevent it from sticking to the pan on its own.
Continue to stir or turn the spinach with a spatula or tongs until all leaves are heated evenly, appear wilted, and turn a bright green.Fresh baby spinach reduces in size considerably as it cooks. You can add more spinach to the pan as it cooks down and makes more space, if desired.

, Place your rinsed and dried baby spinach into a pot and cover it with water. Bring the water to a boil and cook for one minute before removing.You can boil the spinach for longer than a minute, but it will quickly get tender and turn a bright green after very little time.
After boiling, pour the contents of the pot into a colander to drain.

, Try steaming your spinach by placing your rinsed baby spinach into a steaming basket and putting it into a pot with a small amount of water to boil for three to five minutes.This method cooks the spinach lightly and skips the draining step necessary for boiling.
If you are pressed for time, you can also steam fresh spinach in the microwave by placing it in a microwave-safe bowl with a small amount of water, covering the bowl with a lid, and microwaving for 30 seconds to two minutes depending on your microwave and desired cooking level."

, Wash the asparagus under cool, running water, scrubbing the spears gently with your fingers.


Focus on the tip, since most of the dirt will wedge itself there.

, Hold each spear with one hand near the cut end, about 2 inches (5 cm) up or around the area where the color starts to fade. Use your other hand to snap the end off.


Cut the ends off with a sharp knife if you have trouble snapping them off. Use a serrated knife, rather than a smooth blade, to prevent the knife from slipping as you cut.
Save the ends for stock, if desired. Otherwise, discard them.







,, Place the asparagus into a large, resealable plastic bag and drizzle the olive oil over the spears. Seal the bag and shake until the spears are evenly coated.

, Place the asparagus onto your baking sheet in a single layer.


Do not pile or stack the spears. If cooked in multiple layers, the asparagus spears may not cook evenly, causing some to finish baking while the others will still be partially raw.
Avoid letting the spears touch. The asparagus spears do not need to be spaced far apart, but it is generally thought best to leave a small gap of space between the spears to allow heat to disperse evenly around each one.

, Lightly sprinkle the seasonings over the spears, flipping the asparagus spears over in order to season both sides.

, Thick asparagus spears will take approximately 20 minutes to become tender.


Alternatively, bake the asparagus for about 12 minutes or until they are ""tender-crisp"" and still have a little crunchiness to them.

, Remove the asparagus from the oven and let cool slightly before serving.

, Turn the broiler on five minutes in advance or more to make sure that the oven gets hot enough.Most broilers only have ""on"" and ""off"" settings. Some also have ""high"" and ""low"" settings, however. If yours has multiple settings, switch it on to ""low.""
Note that the oven will generally take quicker to warm up when preheated for broiling than it takes when preheated for baking.
The advantage of broiling is that foods cook in less time. As a result, the asparagus will retain more of its vitamins and minerals.

, Line the asparagus up in a single layer.


Do not pile the spears on top of one another. The asparagus will not cook evenly in multiple layers. This is especially important to note for the broiler. Only the top heating element of the oven is used for the broiler, so any asparagus on a bottom layer would not receive enough heat.
Strictly speaking, a grated broiler pan is not absolutely necessary. You can use any bakeware approved for oven use, but a grated broiler pan works best since it allows air to circulate under the food, thereby preventing the oil from becoming too hot and igniting.

, Spread the oil over the spears as evenly as possible. Flip the asparagus spears over and drizzle both sides for best results.

, If you drizzled oil over all sides of the spears, sprinkle the salt and pepper over all sides, as well.

,


Check the asparagus after the 5 minutes have passed. If the spears can be pierced with a knife, they are finished. If not, flip the spears over to the other side and cook an additional 5 minutes.







, Allow the asparagus to cool slightly, but serve them while they are still warm.

, If you want to add more depth to the flavor of your asparagus, try adding a few different spices and seasonings as you add the salt and pepper.


Sprinkle 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) garlic powder or onion powder for an aromatic, savory effect.
Replace the salt and pepper with equal amounts of seasoned salt for a bolder, more well-rounded taste.
For a spicier approach, add 1 tsp (5 ml) chili powder or 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) crushed red pepper.

, Certain juices and vinegars can be drizzled over the asparagus immediately after you pull them out of the oven.


Drizzle 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of lemon juice or lime juice for a fresh zing.
For a sweet taste with a hint of tanginess, drizzle 1 Tbsp (15 ml) balsamic vinegar over the asparagus.
Sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over the cooked asparagus after transferring it to serving plates for a flavorful and visually-appealing finish.
Add 1/4 cup (60 ml) toasted almonds to the asparagus and toss lightly to mix. Serve at room temperature.
Give the asparagus a mild Asian flair by drizzling 2 tsp (10 ml) sesame oil over the spears. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds after plating.

Use your fingers to pry open the new seam and pluck out the individual beans inside. You should be able to gather four to eight beans from each pod.

, The skins covering each bean also need to be removed. Do so by quickly steaming or blanching the beans until the skins shrivel up.

Steam the beans in a steamer basket set over boiling water for roughly 1 minute. Let them cool, then peel or pop the beans out of their skins by applying light pressure to one end.
Parboil/blanch the beans by submerging them in boiling water for 30 seconds. Transfer the beans to a bowl of ice water for another 30 seconds, then peel or pop them out of their skins.

, Place the oil in a large saucepan and set it on the stove over medium-high heat. Allow the oil to heat up for 30 to 60 seconds., Toss the diced onion into the oil and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 to 7 minutes.

The onion should become more aromatic after the first few minutes. Continue cooking it until the pieces become notably soft and slightly translucent.

, Toss the four ingredients into the saucepan and stir until evenly combined with the onion.

Allow the contents of the saucepan to sit over medium-high heat until the water begins a steady simmer.

, Cover the pan and reduce the heat to medium-low. Continue cooking the beans at a gentle simmer until they become very tender.You don't need to stir the beans as they cook, but if you want to stir them to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the pan, only do so once or twice. Opening the pan too often could cause too much steam to escape and may increase the overall cooking time.

, Add the lemon juice to the saucepan and simmer, uncovered, for another 5 minutes.

Taste the mixture after it simmers. Adjust the seasonings as desired to match your personal sense of taste.

, Pour the contents of the saucepan into a blender and puree until it becomes thick and smooth.

Stop the blender and stir the puree with a spoon to make sure that the mixture is thoroughly mashed.
You could also use a food processor instead of a blender during this step.

To reduce the amount of oil used in this recipe, line the baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil instead of coating it with cooking spray.

, Snap the end of each bean pod and peel the string down the entire length of the pod. Twist the string at the end of each pod to remove it.

For this cooking method, you actually need to keep the beans in their pods. Do not pry open the pod after removing the string and do not try to pluck out the individual beans.

, Fill a large mixing bowl with cool, fresh water and submerge the beans. Use your fingers to gently scrub away any dirt and debris.

When the water becomes notably dirty, dump it and add more fresh water to the bowl. Do this once or twice, or until the soaking water remains clear.
After cleaning them, dry the bean pods with clean paper towels.

, Arrange the fava bean pods on your prepared baking sheet in a single layer.

Try to arrange the pods so that the split sides face upward. Doing so is not absolutely crucial, but it will help make it easier for the salt and oil to seep inside and flavor the individual beans.

, Sprinkle the pods with salt, then drizzle them with oil.

Gently rock or shake the pan afterward to coat the bean pods more evenly.

, Place the beans in your preheated oven and cook them until the pods become soft and lightly browned. This will usually take 25 to 30 minutes.Use a serving spatula to stir the beans halfway through the roasting process. Doing so promotes more even cooking.

, Remove the roasted beans from the oven and sprinkle with black pepper. Enjoy the beans immediately or wait until they cool to room temperature.

Note that small roasted bean pods can actually be eaten whole.
Large fava bean pods will have a stringy texture, though, so you should pop the beans out of the shell using your fingers. Eat only the individual beans and not the bean pod.

Learn the sizes of each cut.,
Practice the Julienne method first.",How to Do Formal Vegetable Cuts1,"










Julienne. According to most, a standard Julienne is 4mm x 4mm x 5cm, or 1/8 x 1/8 x 2 inches. 1/8th of an inch is approx 3mm, so the sizes do vary from school to school.

Chiffonade. This cut is mostly used with leafy greens and herbs for things like garnishes, salads and coleslaw. Its basically very fine shreds. The size definition is rather informal in that there seems to be no formal sizes so luckily that's easier according to what is practical.

Jardiniere. These are vegetable ""batons"". They are shorter and fatter with sizes ranging from 2cm x 4mm x 4mm (4/5 x 1/5 x 1/5 of an inch) or as large as 4cm x 10mm x 10mm (1.5 x 2/5 x 2/5 of an inch).

Brunoise. Brunoise is a fine dice measuring 4mm x 4mm x 4mm, or 1/8 x 1/8 x 1/8 inches.

Macedoine. This is a slightly larger dice with sizes measuring from 5mm cubed to 10mm cubed (10mm is the more common size).

Paysanne. This translates as Peasant but the sizes are far more flexible.

, As the methods are quite similar, the other cuts either borrow from or continue on the same method as the Julienne cut, so this is the best all-rounder to be start with.

Grate cheese using a microplane cheese grater.,
Unwrap your block of cheese.,
Holding the microplane over a plate or board, gently swipe the cheese against the grate using an up-and-down motion.,
Tap the metal end of the grater lightly against the edge of the plate to release excess trimmings.,
Switch out your microplane size depending on what you're using cheese for.",How to Grate Cheese1," A microplane cheese grater consists of a handle attached to a long, flat grate with small, sharp teeth.Although they are usually used for zesting lemons or grating garlic, they are perfectly serviceable when it comes to grating cheese.


Because microplanes tend to produce smaller pieces of grated cheese, they are best used with hard cheeses such as Parmesan or Pecorino. Grating a soft cheese like mozzarella with a microplane would only give you a mushy mass instead of cleanly grated cheese.;
, If it is too large to hold comfortably with one hand, slice it into manageable pieces with a knife. Err on the side of larger rather than smaller — there's less of a chance you'll hurt yourself with a big piece of cheese.








, Continue until you have the desired amount.








, Use a pastry brush, if necessary, to remove all the cheese trimmings from the microplane.








, Microplane graters come in a variety of sizes ranging from fine to coarse.Finely shredded cheese can be used as the top layer of a freshly made pizza. Medium shredded cheese is thicker and a nice topping for baked potatoes or salads. Coarsely grated cheese is the thickest and can be used to garnish pasta.

Apply the paste to the grout.,
Mix water and vinegar.,
Spray the mixture onto the paste.,
Scrub the grout.,
Wipe the grout.",How to Clean Grout with Vinegar2," Combine about two tablespoons of baking soda with about one tablespoon (15 milliliters) of water. The mixture should not be too thin. If it sloshes about in the bowl you mixed it in, add some more baking soda to help it achieve a more paste-like texture. It also shouldn’t be too thick. If the mixture is thick and dry, and doesn’t adhere well to the fork or spoon you use to mix it, add some water to thin it out.


The more grout you have to clean, the more paste you’ll need., The easiest way to apply the paste to the grout is with your finger. Simply scoop a little dollop of the paste onto your finger tip and smear it in an even layer across the grout you wish to clean., In a spray bottle, combine water and vinegar in a one-to-one ratio. For instance, you might combine 1.5 cups (354 milliliters) vinegar with 1.5 cups (354 milliliters) water.To prevent grout from accumulating grime in the shower, just spray this mixture onto the shower grout two or three times weekly after getting out of the shower.

, Point the nozzle of the spray bottle toward the baking soda paste you’ve smeared along the grout. Squeeze the handle of the bottle. Repeat as necessary until all of the paste has bubbled up somewhat.You may have to wait about five minutes for the vinegar and baking soda to react., Once the paste has become fizzy with the application of the vinegar mixture, use a stiff-bristled toothbrush to scrub the grout clean. Use a toothbrush you aren’t planning on using again for anything but detail cleaning., Once you’ve loosened the grime and grit along your grout, it should wipe away with ease. Take a damp rag or paper towel and wipe it along the grout you’ve cleaned. Wipe the area along the edges of the grout, too, to soak up any of the lingering water/vinegar.If you want to give your floor an additional level of shine, mop the whole thing after you’re done.

Try a salty vinegar mix.,
Use an ammonia solution.",How to Clean Grout with Vinegar3," Mix 3.5 cups (828 milliliters) hot water, ½ cup (170 grams) baking soda, 1/6 cup (40 milliliters) vinegar, and 1/3 cup (80 milliliters) lemon juice in a spray bottle. Aim the nozzle of the spray bottle at the grout you wish to clean. Spray the bottle so that the grout is evenly covered. After one hour, scrub the grout with the scouring side of a sponge to remove the dirt crusted into the grout., Combine ¼ cup (21 grams) salt, ¼ cup (21 grams) baking soda, and ¼ cup vinegar (60 milliliters) in a tall cup or small bowl. Let the solution sit for 20 minutes, then use a small spoon to apply the mixture to the grout. Using a toothbrush or scouring pad, scrub the grout until clean. Once you’re finished, mop the grout or use a damp cloth to wipe the grime away., Mix 3.5 cups (828 milliliters) hot water, ¼ cup (21 grams) baking soda, 1/3 cup (80 milliliters) ammonia, and ¼ cup (60 milliliters) vinegar. Pour the mixture into a spray bottle. Wait 60 minutes, then spray the grout you wish to clean. Use a scouring sponge to remove the dirt from the grout. Wipe the grime away with a damp rag."

If your coconut is in pieces, you can just pare off the skin using a sharp knife., If your coconut flesh came off in big chunks, it might not fit in your food processor. Cut the pieces of coconut into smaller squares so that it can fit in your food processor., Take the white pieces of coconut that you cut off and put them into your food processor and pulse it for 10-15 seconds., Open the top of the processor and scrape the coconut that got stuck to the sides of the processor., Continue processing the coconut until it reaches the consistency that you want. Once you're done grinding it up, you can put the flakes in the refrigerator or dehydrate them.Fresh coconut flakes will stay good in the refrigerator for two to three days.

Bigger pieces are easier to grate when you are using a box grater, so try to remove large pieces., Using your non-dominant hand, grab onto the top handle of the box grater and hold it tightly. As you grate, use your arm to keep the grater pressed tightly against the cutting board or table., Choose how small you want your coconut flakes. Use the large holes on the grater if you want to have larger coconut flakes and the medium or small holes for smaller flakes. Grab the white coconut flesh with your dominant hand and move it back and forth against the holes of the grater.

Use a paper towel to pat down the flakes and remove as much moisture as you can before you dehydrate them., Place the cooking sheet inside of a convection oven at 100 - 125°F (40 - 50°C) for two hours. This will draw the moisture out of the coconut and dry out the flakes., If you have a dehydrator, you can use it to dry out your coconut instead of the oven. Place the flakes inside of the dehydrator and allow them to dry out for eight to ten hours, or long enough until they are dried to your liking.Dehydrated coconut flakes will last 2-3 months in a zip lock bag."

Select your vegetable: Julienne can be done with any firm vegetable, such as carrot, celery, potato, capsicum / bell pepper, turnip, swede/rutabaga, zucchini/courgette, sweet potato / kumara etc.,
Peel your vegetable and cut into 5cm / 2 inch portions with as straight a cut as possible.,
Sit the vegetable upright on the cut edge and cut the rounded edges off.,
Slice the vegetable into strips 4mm or 1/8inch wide.,
Stack these up again like a stack of cards as high as you feel safe with to slice.,
You have now achieved your Julienne cut vegetables.",How to Do Formal Vegetable Cuts2," Vegetables such as onion, or soft fruits such as tomato aren't ideal to julienne.






;
, You will be sitting the vegetable up in the next stage on this cut edge. An uneven cut may make the vegetable slip when you are slicing.








, You can rechauffé these into anything else such as soups, stocks and sauces or mashed vegetables. The vegetable should now have right angled corners and straight sides.








, Any leftover can also be a reheated in the same way. You should now have a pile of 4mm x 5cm slices.








, Even the edges as that assures an even result. Then slice them in 4mm / 1/8th of an inch slices to make long matchsticks.









Curved vegetables such as celery or cucumber should be cut into the 5cm portions, then sliced long ways (or with the grain) to give even slices, then these can be julienned.

Use a box grater to shred your cheese.,
Keep your cheese medium to large sized.,
Lightly coat the outside of the grater plate you will be using with cooking spray.,
Let your box grate decide how you'll use it.,
Rub the cheese against the grater in an up-and-down motion.",How to Grate Cheese2," A box grater is four sided, with each side having differently sized teeth.


Because box grates tend to have larger teeth, they work well with softer cheeses such as mozzarella or havarti.
Choose whichever grater plate suits the dish. The medium sized holes are great for garnishing tacos, but not so much for making crumb-like Parmesan to go on Spaghetti.

, This will prevent you from scraping your fingers before you have the desired amount of shredded cheese.

, This will make the cheese glide easier.







, For box graters without a handle, hold the cheese and grater over a large bowl. For graters with a handle, place the end of the grater on a cutting board.

, Once you reach the end of the cheese, rub it with your palm to avoid scraping your knuckles.







"
"
Slice your cheese using a rotary grater.,
Apply some pressure to the top of the handle with your thumb.,
Turn the handle with your other hand while aiming the grating compartment at a nearby plate or bowl.,
Rotary graters are safer as your hands are not required to press against the plates.They are also very efficientand are best reserved for making large quantities of shredded cheese.",How to Grate Cheese3," A rotary grater consists of a handle connected to a circular grating compartment. A side crank is then rotated to grate the cheese. Raise the top handle of the grater, place a small block of cheese into the compartment, and lower the handle.

, Grip the handle normally with your other fingers.

, Stop whenever you feel like you have enough shredded cheese.








, For example, if you need to make nacho dips or breakfast casseroles, use a rotary grater.

Shred cheese with a vegetable peeler.,
Use a sharp kitchen knife to thinly slice cheese.,
Mince cheese with a food processor.,
Finished.

",How to Grate Cheese4," Though not as efficient or glamorous as using a cheese grater, a vegetable peeler will still get the job done.









Hold a medium sized block of cheese over a regular sized plate. Rub the peeler against the cheese in a continuous forward motion.
For higher quality slices, refrigerate the cheese first or opt for a hard type of cheese (such as Parmesan)., Though this is more time consuming, a knife is a nice substitute for a vegetable peeler.









Hold a small chunk of cheese against the surface of a plate. Gently slice off thin shreds onto the plate.
Opt for a plain edge rather than a serrated edge. Plain edge knives are better at shaving and skinning.Avoid holding large blocks of cheese. Since knife work is more dangerous than other grating options, you want to have a steady and firm grip on the cheese.

, For quick and easy shredded cheese, a food processor is the optimal choice.


Refrigerate your cheese until it is firm but not too hard. Chop it into smaller blocks and place it in your food processor.Be cautious about overloading your processor. Some food processor blades have seized up or become unbalanced when grating cheese.Turn the food processor on and monitor the shape of the cheese shreds. Once you have shredded the cheese to your liking, turn off the processor and empty it onto a plate.
If your processor has a shredding disk, select this blade as it will provide better quality slices.
Avoid processing softer cheeses such as Mozzarella. This will result in smeared, not shredded, cheese.,"

",How to Blanch Carrots," Rinse them thoroughly under running water to remove dirt and other debris.






;
, Use a vegetable peeler to peel the outer skin. This will improve the taste and texture of the blanched carrots, and make them look more appealing.








, Carrots will blanch more quickly and have an improved texture if you cut them into smaller pieces. This helps them cook evenly and prevents you from having to cook them too long. Chop off the root end and trim any bruised areas, then slice the carrots into smaller pieces.









Slice them into medallions for a great salad add-on.
Slice them into sticks for a convenient snack.
Slice them into quarters if you're planning on freezing them for later use.
Try to make sure the carrot pieces are the same size, so they'll cook evenly.

, You'll need this to stop the carrots from cooking after you boil them.








, Use a saucepan large enough to hold the carrots, and fill it about 3/4 the way full. Heat the water on the stove top on the highest heat. Season the water to taste by adding salt. Wait until the water is at a high rolling boil.








, Generally allow more time for full size carrots as opposed to baby or chopped carrots. Stay near the stove and take the carrots off the heat as soon as the timer goes off.








, Set the timer and let them cool for the same amount of time as they spent blanching. If they blanched for 3 minutes, let them cool for 3 minutes.








, Drain the carrots and pat them dry with a paper towel. Use straight away if desired or set aside to use in another recipe.

Detach the drumstick.,
Slice off the skin, if desired.,
Cut down the length of the bone.,
Remove the cartilage on the top or bottom of the bone.,
Cut underneath the bone.,
Trim the fat.,
Check for gristle and bone fragments.,
Debone chicken thighs in large batches and freeze the leftovers.,
Save the thigh bones for chicken stock.,
Use chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts.",How to Debone a Chicken Thigh," If the drumstick or leg is still attached to the chicken thigh, you will need to slide your cutting instrument in between the connecting joint to sever it. Cut through the rest of the meat in the surrounding area to separate the thigh and drumstick completely.








Bend the leg to locate the joint in between the thigh and drumstick. Try to bend in several places until you succeed. The point at which the chicken leg bends is the joint.
Place the thigh skin-side-down and cut into this joint, severing it all the way through to detach the two pieces.
If you accidentally hit the bone as you try detaching the thigh and the drumstick, move the knife over slightly until you find the right spot, which should be fairly easy to sever.
All work should be done on a clean cutting board if at all possible. Using a clean cutting board minimizes the risk of getting germs from your counter or another work surface onto the meat as well as minimizing the risk of accidentally damaging your counter with the blade of your cutting instrument. Moreover, a cutting board can be easier to clean than a kitchen counter, which reduces the risk of salmonella or other food-borne bacteria and viruses from spreading.
There are several cutting instruments you can use. Some people find that a knife with a long, narrow blade, like a fillet knife, works best. For others, clean kitchen shears or scissors are easiest to work with. In a pinch, you could also use a simple paring or boning knife.;
, If the recipe in question calls for chicken thighs that are both skinless and boneless, you can remove the skin cutting off the membrane in between the skin and muscle. Use your fingers to peel back the skin as you cut the membrane away.









Note that you could also slip off the skin after deboning and trimming the thigh if necessary. Some cooks prefer to do this step beforehand, while others wait until after. There is no single correct time to do it, though, so it is merely a matter of personal preference.

, Working on the bottom side of the chicken thigh, make an incision from the top end of the thigh down to the bottom, cutting as close to the bone as possible.









The side that either has or had the skin on it should face down during this part of the process.
The cut needs to be deep so that you can reveal as much of the bone as possible. Work carefully, though, since you do not want to cut straight through to the other side of the thigh.Cut along both sides of the bone to reveal as much of it as possible.

, Use your cutting instrument to slice away the tough piece of cartilage holding the bone onto the meat at the top or bottom of the cut.








If you do not remove the cartilage, you might not be able to pry the bone away from the meat enough to slip your cutting tool in between the two.

, Glide your cutting instrument from one end of the bone to the other, slicing through the connecting membrane that otherwise keeps the bone attached to the meat.









If using shears or scissors, simply cut through the muscle and membranes directly. If using a knife, you might need to cut using a slightly sawing motion.
Keep the knife as close to the bone as possible to avoid losing more meat than necessary.
Never cut toward your fingers since doing so could result in you accidentally slicing into your hand.
Grab the bone and pull it up and away from the thigh meat as you cut.
It may take several passes before you succeed in removing the bone from the thigh.
Use short, scraping cuts to finish severing the bone from the meat.

, Once the bone has been removed, inspect the thigh for pockets of fat. Use your cutting instrument to remove these now.









It is better to wait until the bone has been removed and the thigh has been opened up before doing this. More of the thigh meat will be exposed by the end of the deboning process than at the beginning, and being able to see more of the meat will make it easier to spot and remove more of the fat.

, Sometimes, bone fragments and gristle can be left behind, even if you deboned the thigh properly. Inspect the chicken thigh for any of these types of debris and cut them away before using the thigh.









At this point, the chicken thigh has been deboned and prepped for cooking. You can use it in whatever recipe you would like now.

, Buying in bulk can save you money, and if you prepare enough chicken thighs in advance to use for several meals, you can minimize the amount of time you spend on a weeknight preparing dinner.









Wrap the meat in plastic freezer wrap, butcher paper, or heavy duty aluminum foil. Place the thighs in airtight freezer-safe plastic containers or plastic resealable bags. Vacuum-sealed bags are even better.Store the chicken in the coldest part of the freezer.
Freezing raw chicken thighs in 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) will keep the food safe indefinitely, but for the sake of quality, it is strongly recommended that you use frozen chicken thighs within 9 months., The thigh bones and the scraps of meat attached to them may not be edible, but they do pack a lot of flavor. You can make use of this flavor by using your bones and scraps for stock that can be used in soups, stews, gravies, and other recipes.









If you want to use the the bones for stock but do not have time immediately after deboning the thighs, you can wrap them up in heavy duty aluminum foil or in an airtight, freezer-safe resealable plastic bag. Save the bones and scraps up to 3 or 4 months before using.
You can prepare a simple stock by putting leftover bones from 2 to 4 lbs (900 to 1800 g) of thighs in a large stockpot and covering the bones with cold water.Add chopped celery, onions, carrots, and parsley to the water, along with roughly 1 tsp (5 ml) of salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of black pepper.
Boil all the ingredients.
After the contents of the pot reach a boil, reduce the heat and let simmer gently, uncovered, for 4 hours or more. Skim off the foam that develops from time to time.
Strain out the bones and vegetables and save the liquid stock.
This stock can be used immediately or saved for later.



, Since chicken thighs tend to stay more moist than chicken breasts and are harder to overcook, may people prefer using them over chicken breasts. If you have extra chicken thighs and you do not have a recipe handy that calls for them, you can simply use the thigh meat in another recipe that originally calls for chicken breasts.









Note that when using chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts, you may need to cook the chicken for a longer period of time than indicated in the original recipe's instructions since thigh meat takes longer to cook than breast meat.

Select your vegetable according to your needs.",How to Do Formal Vegetable Cuts3,"
For things like basil or spinach, gather them into a neat stack (like a pile of cards) then slice lengthwise to make long strips approx 1mm or 1/25th of an inch wide, or roll the stack up and slice them the same width.
Rolling them can make it easier, but too big a roll will be harder. Its fine to roll up herbs such as basil, but not ideal for lettuce or anything you will serve raw as it may bruise them and the final result won't be as crisp.
As cabbage and lettuce leaves are already in layers, its easier to cut them into wedges and then take smaller portions of that wedge, gently pressing them flat to slice the same way without rolling to maintain crispness.









Aim to remove thick fleshy parts of the cabbage or lettuce to make the slices more even, however this is not essential, but is desirable when catering for a formal event.

Remove extra skin, fat, and other unwanted parts.",How to Debone a Chicken Breast1," Deboning a frozen or partially-frozen chicken breast is very difficult. Make sure your chicken breast is entirely thawed before beginning to de-bone. You can thaw your chicken by putting it in the refrigerator overnight, putting it in a bowl of water, or using your microwave's defrost setting.
, Make sure the cutting board is clean and that the chicken breast doesn’t have wings or leg meat attached to it. If it does, cut it off.







, This will prepare it for splitting and help you find the breastbone quickly. Use a chef’s knife to get the cleanest cuts.








, Slide your fingers into the cut you made and pull the skin off the entire chicken breast. You should be able to simply pull it off by hand, but cutting is okay too., Look inside the cut to locate the breastbone. Most chicken breasts will have only one bone, which runs lengthwise down the middle of the chicken breast. Sometimes the ribs will still be attached, but you can ignore them--the chicken will come right off the ribs when you cut it away from the bone.







, Slide your knife into the cut you already made so it’s between the meat and the breastbone. Using a scraping motion with the knife, cut along the bone so that the meat separates from it.







, Repeat the same scraping motion along the other side of the breastbone. If any part of the chicken is still attached to the breast, pull or cut it off. You now have two boneless, skinless chicken breast halves!







, If there is any extra skin, fat, tendons, or cartilage remaining on your chicken breast, cut it off. You can throw them away, or keep them along with the bones for homemade chicken stock.

Asparagus should be a vivid green free from brown mottling. The tips should be tightly closed.






Choose stalks of uniform thickness for more control and consistency in the cooking process.





;
, Add a tablespoon of salt and return the pot to a boil.


Adding salt to boiling water not only adds some seasoning to the water, but it also increases the boiling point of the water. This in turn assists in cooking your food more efficiently.







, Fill 2/3 of a large bowl with cold water. Add in 6-10 ice cubes and allow the bath to sit.


Sometimes called ""shocking the asparagus,"" this ice bath stops the asparagus from cooking and should take as long as the cooking process.

, Carefully drop the asparagus into the boiling water and cook it until the spears turn bright green. This usually takes between 2-4 minutes, depending on the size (or diameter) of the stalks.


Start counting the blanching time as soon as the water returns to a boil after adding in the asparagus.






For small stalks, cook for 2 minutes; medium stalks should cook for 3 minutes. Most large stalks will be done cooking at 4 minutes. All times are approximate., When your asparagus is bright green and crisp-tender, remove it from the boiling water using a slotted spoon or small mesh sieve. Place immediately into the ice water bath.

, Place your vegetables on a paper towel-lined baking sheet to remove all excess water.


If you are cooking these vegetables in advance, or plan on transporting them (picnic, potluck), refrigerate them in a paper towel-lined plastic bag.

, Blanching can be the primary cooking method or, alternatively, it can be used as the first step before adding the vegetables to a flavor-packed stir-fry or sauté.


Blanching is an important step in preparing vegetables for freezing. Scalding the vegetables stops enzymes actions that break the vegetable down contributing to a loss of flavor, crispness, and color.
Blanching before freezing also cleanses the surface of the vegetable from dirt and other foreign particles, slows the loss of vitamins, and makes the veggies softer and easier to pack.

First, when cooking green vegetables, be careful not to steam them.,
Use a large amount of water, then add salt.,
Always bring the water to a boil before you add the vegetables.,
Only cook the vegetables until they are tender.,
It is also important to stop the cooking process as soon as the vegetable is cooked perfectly.,
Prepare your vegetables however you like them, and enjoy them with your eyes, as well as your taste buds.

",How to Keep Cooked Broccoli Bright Green," Green vegetables contain chlorophyll, when chlorophyll is cooked, it produces carbon dioxide. Since you have to cover the vegetables to steam them, the chlorophyll turns a drab, grayish color. You can prevent this by boiling the greens, in salted water.;
, The recipe calls for one ounce for every four cups of water. The salt provides a ""barrier"" against the carbon dioxide, and keeps the chlorophyll green.

, This will ensure the pores on the vegetables will be quickly blocked, and prevent vitamins and minerals from leaching out into the water.

, You do not want to overcook, or undercook them. For broccoli, about 5-7 minutes, green beans, 10-12. Just keep testing them with a fork.

, The best way to do this is a quick ice bath. Strain the vegetables into a colander, then dip them into a bowl, or sink, of ice cold water. This prevents accidental overcooking.

Fill a stockpot with water.,
Create an ice bath.,
Find a large space for peeling and preparing peaches.

,
Choose your peaches.,
Buy or pick a lot of peaches.,
Rinse your peaches.,
Slit an “x” in the bottom of each peach with a sharp knife.,
Place 4 whole peaches in your boiling water.,
Time your peaches according to how ripe they are.,
Remove the peaches with the spoon.,
Let the peaches sit in the ice bath for 2 minutes.,
Remove them from the ice bath and peel them.,
Cut the peaches in half.,
Repeat the process to blanch all of your peaches.

",How to Blanch Peaches," Set it to boil.


The stockpot doesn’t have to be very large. You can only fit in as many peaches as will comfortably float at the top—about 4 for most pots.
3-piece stockpot sets with removable colanders work perfectly for blanching. You can remove the fruit without removing the boiling water.;
, Fill a large bowl with cold water. Drop ice cubes into the water.


Set the ice bath near the stove.

,, Freestone peaches may be slightly less sweet than clingstone peaches, but they are easier to pull away from the pit.


Clingstone peaches are usually available starting mid-June. Freestone peaches are usually available starting in July.
Store bought peaches are likely to have ripened off the tree, while those at the local farmer’s market were probably tree-ripened. , Blanching is best done with a large batch, since you can blanch many batches of peaches in your pot of boiling water.

, You don’t need to scrub them because you will peel them; however, removing dirt and chemicals will make the boiling water useful for many batches.

, Two intersecting lines that extend deep in the peach will allow for expansion during the blanching process. They will also make the peaches easier to peel. , Stand close by with a slotted spoon.

, The following guidelines are good:


For over-ripe peaches, blanch for 45 seconds.
For ripe peaches, blanch for 1 to 1.5 minutes.
For fairly ripe peaches, blanch for 2 minutes.
For harder peaches, blanch for 3 minutes. , Place them in the ice bath right away.

, They should be slightly warm still, so that they are easier to peel.

, Place a knife just under the peel near your “x” and pull it off. Repeat with each corner of the “x.”

, Remove the pit. Slice them thinly.

Remove any unwanted parts.",How to Debone a Chicken Breast2," Check to make sure the skin doesn’t have quills or tears. You can pull quills out using tweezers or pliers. If the skin is torn, be careful as you work so you don’t enlarge the tear., If you are keeping the skin on, you need to find the bone by turning the chicken over, skin side down, rather than by cutting through it. Find the ends of the breastbone. You can start deboning from either end--whichever end has more bone visible from the outside., Slide your knife above the breastbone, between the bone and the meat. Work your knife as deeply along the bone as you can, pulling up on the meat with your other hand. Be careful not to slice through the meat!, Use your hands to pull the entire breast off the bone. You can use the knife to help, but pulling will prevent you from cutting through the skin. You should have an entire single breast with the skin on., Cut off any gristle, tendons, or excess folds of skin."

, Pull it away from the body. You want to be able to see where the leg and hip bones connect.








You can also use a carving fork to hold the chicken in place while you pull the leg away from the body.

, Cutting through the skin on the side of the chicken will allow you to better see where the leg and body meet.








, Use the carving knife to cut through the hip joint to remove the entire leg. By pulling the leg out, you create right angle that is easier to cut through.








, Cutting through the cartilage will give you a clean cut without splintering any bone. Repeat these steps on the other leg.

Place the leg so that it is skin-side down on the cutting board.,
Grasp both sides of the leg which each hand.,
Locate the fat line.",How to Cut up a Whole Chicken3," It is generally easier to cut through the meat of the chicken first before working your way through the skin (which may need to be cut with a serrated knife.) The drumstick is the smaller part of the leg while the thigh is the larger, meatier part.







, Bend the leg backwards in the opposite direction of natural movement. Doing this will help you to find the back of the knee joint between the drumstick and thigh, which is the easiest place to cut.








, The fat line is a thin, white line that runs along the joint between the drumstick and thigh. Cut along the fat line, separating the joint and thus the drumstick and thigh. Repeat these steps on the other leg.

Lay the whole breast on the cutting board.,
Slice the breast from the bone.,
Insert your thumb along this cut to loosen the meat from the bone.",How to Cut up a Whole Chicken4," This spot is along the ribs where the white breast meat swells out from the body.








, Do not cut from front to back, as doing so will give you a less secure grip on the meat, which could result in sloppy cuts or even cutting yourself. When you have cut the breast from the back, you will have a whole breast cut and the back section in two pieces.









You can also cut along the breastbone, again starting at the back of the bird. Cut through the wishbone when you get to it. Angle the knife and cut down towards the wing, running the knife along the wishbone. Make a cut between the breast and the wing.Another option is to pop out the keel bone by bending the breast halves backwards. Remove the keel bone and cut the breast into halves through the wishbone.

, Pressing hard, push the center down into the cutting board with the flat of your hand. This motion is to help separate the breast bone.








, Run your knife through the center of the breast, down along the bone.








, If you want boneless breast meat, cut the bone away on either side and lift it out. You may need to break the cartilage to achieve removing the breast bone.









If you want to keep the bone in the meat, split the bone with your knife and holding both sides, break the bone apart.

Use a lot of water.,
Cook the vegetables without a cover.,
Keep it at a high heat level.,
Test if cooked as explained below (""Blanching Time Chart"").

,
Serve immediately.",How to Blanch Vegetables2," Use 2.8 litres/ 3 quarts of water per 450 g / 1 pound of vegetables. There needs to be enough water to allow the vegetables to cook quickly; less water would cause the vegetables to stew and they will become limp, losing color, texture, and nutrition.

, It is fine to cover the pot when bringing the water to the boil but the blanching part should be done without the lid. Otherwise, you will trap the volatile acids released by the vegetables during cooking and this will cause the vegetables to become limp and deteriorate in color.

, Boiling water is important for keeping the green vegetables in top condition. The vegetables should be cooked as quickly as possible and boiling water will enable this.

,, Drain and serve. Don't leave the vegetables to sit or they're freshness will deteriorate as they keep ""cooking"". If you must leave them rather than serve them immediately, plunge them into ice water and serve reheated or cold later (as explained above).

You can be burned by fat or grease if the chicken is too hot., Cooked chicken doesn’t stick to the bone as much as raw chicken, so simply cutting the breast in half is sufficient to locate the breastbone. It may simply fall off the bone as you cut!, If there is still meat along either side of the breastbone, cut lightly along each side. Don’t cut too hard--if your knife is sharp enough, it could cut right through the bone., You can use your hands to pull the chicken off in most cases--you’ll get more meat. Using a knife is fine if you need it."

Use this method for any raw, fresh beans.,
Wash the beans under fresh running water to remove any debris and dirt.,
If preparing green beans or other long beans, cut off the thick stem end with a small knife.,
Boil a pot of water.,
Prepare a bowl of chilled water.,
Boil the beans for about three minutes, using a timer.,
Chill the beans.,
Drain the cooled beans.,
Dry the beans after chilling.,
Place the beans in freezer-safe containers.,
Use within 10 months for highest quality.,
Thaw before using.",How to Blanch Beans," The method is almost identical regardless of what beans you are blanching. While one reason to blanch is to preserve the bright color of green beans or lima beans, any fresh bean benefits from blanching to preserve its flavor and nutrients.Dried beans require different cooking methods, since blanching will not fully cook them.;
, The blanching should remove dirt as well, so you do not need to clean the beans thoroughly., It is not necessary to remove both ends of the bean.


If the beans are particularly long you may choose to cut them in half. This will not affect the blanching process, but may make them easier to include in a salad or other dish.

, Heat a pot of water to boiling, using approximately one gallon for each pound of beans (8 liters of water per kilogram of beans). If you are only blanching a handful or two of beans, you do not need to measure precisely.


Optionally, add salt to the water for flavor.
Leave enough space in the pot to fit the beans. If the amount of water required does not fit within approximately 2/3 of the pot, use a larger pot or blanch the beans in multiple batches.

, Prepare the cold water bath while the water is boiling, since the beans will only take a few minutes to boil. The water will work best if it is 60ºF (15.5ºC) or below, in order to rapidly cool the beans before they begin to lose nutrients and flavor.


Ice is recommended to keep this water cold. If you are blanching a large quantity of beans, use approximately equal amounts of ice and beans by weight.If the cold tap water from your sink stings or numbs your hand, it is cold enough to use. This water will warm to room temperature quickly, however, so if you are not using ice you may wish to fill the water bowl toward the end of the boiling process. Replace the water frequently to keep it cold if you are blanching more than one pot of beans.

, Add the beans to the water and start timing them once the water has returned to a boil. Boil green beans and other long beans for 3 minutes. Other types of bean, including lima, butter, and pinto beans, will require 2 to 4 minutes depending on size.The beans will taste cooked but still crisp when they are done blanching.If the water takes more than 60 seconds to return to a boil, you may be using too much water. Reduce the amount of water next time to avoid losing flavor and nutrients.
If you have a blanching or steaming basket, you may place the beans inside it and lower it into the water. This makes it possible to remove the beans without draining your water, which can then be used to blanch the next batch of beans or cook other foods.

, Once the beans are ready, remove the beans from the boiling water and submerge them in the cold water bath until they are cold to the touch. Removing the beans from the hot water can be accomplished by draining the beans through a strainer, or by lifting out the blanching basket if you used one.


This sudden chilling process is sometimes called ""shocking"".
Leave the beans in for approximately 3 minutes if you are not sure whether they are cool.

, Once the beans are cold, drain away the ice water or remove them from the bath with a slotted spoon. Your beans are now blanched and ready to use in a salad, casserole, or stir fry. Because the blanching process has sealed in nutrients and color, the blanched beans will also preserve at a higher quality if frozen.

, Once the beans are blanched and chilled, they are ready for freezing. First, pat them dry to avoid ice crystals damaging the beans.You may use paper towels or a clean cloth.

, You may use freezer bags with a resealable opening, or a vacuum sealer if you have one. If you are using a hard container, leave about 1/2 inch (1.25cm) of space at the top of the container to prevent it from cracking if the beans expand or form ice crystals.


To remove most of the air from a resealable bag, place a drinking straw into the mostly sealed opening and suck out the air. Remove the straw and seal the rest of the way.

, If blanched correctly, the frozen beans should retain their flavor, color, and nutrients for 10–12 months.Using them within a few weeks will give you the best chance at high quality beans, however.

, Remove the desired quantity of beans from the freezer and let thaw before using, or add directly to stir fries. Try to avoid refreezing food once its been thawed, as this may cause the beans to deteriorate in quality. Freezing the beans in small, separate containers may help prevent this.

Remove the root end.,
Slice the leek down the white stalk lengthwise.,
Slice the leek lengthwise once more.,
Chop the leek into small segments.,
Separate the rings with your fingers.",How to Cut Leeks1," Use a sharp knife to chop off the bottom 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) of the leek, cutting away the stringy root.









You should also peel away any outer layers that look stained or wilted. While you will not be using the dark green portion of the leaves, some of the leaves may extend down to the usable light green portion. For that reason, it is important to peel away leaves that look rotted or especially dirty.;
, Make a cut down the center of the stem, beginning from the the top of the light green section and working all the way through the bottom. Cut completely through the stalk.









Stop the cut just below the dark green leaf section. The dark green portion of the leek has a bitter taste and a tough, unpleasant texture, so it is not generally used for cooking.

, Rotate the leek 90 degrees so that the slice you just made runs from side to side. Make another cut down the center of the stalk, the same length as the first, separating the stalk into quarters.









To create larger pieces of leek, skip this step, leaving the leek sliced in half rather than in quarters.

, Make short, 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) cuts across the width of the leek. Work from the bottom up, stopping once more at the dark green portion of the leek.









These cuts should completely release the sliced portions from the rest of the stalk.
The resulting pieces should look like small crescent moons.

, Use your fingers to gently separate the rings apart. This can usually be accomplished simply by tossing the pieces around a bit.

The dark green leaves of a leek are bitter in taste and tough in texture, so it is better to avoid using them.

, Cut the remaining white stalk in half, starting at the newly cut top and working down to the bottom.









The stalk should be divided into to equal halves.

, Place the leek halves cut-side down on the cutting board so that the rounded surface faces up.









Holding the leek halves in this position will prevent them from rolling around as you make additional slices.

, Slice each half lengthwise into tall matchstick-length sections.









Work from one edge to the other rather than starting in the middle.
The pieces should be about 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch (6.35-mm to 1.25-cm) thick.

, The slices may fall apart without you separating them much, but if some of the ""matchsticks"" are stuck together, gently toss them around with your hands until the pieces separate completely.

While fennel is not known to be especially slippery, it is still a wise idea to hold it still on a resistant surface to prevent it from slipping away under your grasp. A silicone cutting board works especially well, but a standard wood cutting board can work well, too. Avoid slippery glass dishes or stone countertops.;
, Cut away the stalks and wispy fronds by slicing them off about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the bulb.The stalks and fronds can be discarded, but they contain a lot of flavor, so you should consider using them for other purposes and in other dishes.
Fronds can be used as a garnish. Stalks can be saved and added to fish stock.
If you decide to save the stalks and fronds, cut the bright green, wispy fronds off of each stalk. Discard any wilted, browning fronds or brown stalks.
Rinse the fronds in cool water and pat dry with paper towels. Place them in resealable plastic bags or plastic wrap until ready to use.

, Use a vegetable peeler to strip the stringy, wilted outer layer of the remaining bulb.This is especially important if the outer layer is wilted, discolored, or tough.
To remove the outer layer with a vegetable peeler, hold the bulb steady in one hand with the cut top end facing your palm and the root end exposed.
Pass the vegetable peeler down and around the outside perimeter of the bulb from top end to bottom end in even strokes.

, Use a sharp knife to cut the brown, dry root portion of the fennel off. The slice should be no thicker than 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).


Hold the fennel down on its side with your non-dominant hand. Keep the knife in your dominant hand.
Discard the root once removed. It is not generally saved for use in other dishes.

, Wash the fennel bulb under cool, running water, gently scrubbing away any pieces of dirt or debris with your fingertips.


Pat the bulb dry with clean paper towels before proceeding further. If you do not dry the fennel, the moisture on the surface may make it more slippery and harder to hold steady as you cut it.

, Stand the bulb up so that it is resting on the trimmed root end. Steady it with your non-dominant hand while slicing it in half lengthwise with your other hand.


Use a sharp, sturdy kitchen knife with a smooth blade.
Make sure that the bulb is cut cleanly and perfectly in half from top to bottom.

, With the bulb halves still standing upright, cut each half in half again from top to bottom, forming quarters.


Continue holding the bulb steady as you cut the quarters.

, Cut into the center of each quarter, slicing the tough inner core away from the more tender layers beyond it. Leave the bottom part of the core intact, however.


You need to keep part of the core when cutting fennel into wedges. Otherwise, there will be nothing connecting the layers and holding them in place, and the wedges will fall apart.

, Continue cutting the fennel quarters from top to bottom to form wedges.


Use your non-dominant hand to hold the bulb still as you cut it. Cut carefully and mind your fingers to avoid accidentally cutting yourself.

, Stand the bulb up so that it is resting on the trimmed root end. Steady it with your non-dominant hand while slicing it in half lengthwise with your other hand.


Use a sharp, sturdy kitchen knife with a smooth blade.

, Cut a wedge-shaped piece from the top center of each half down through the bottom to free the core.


Use your fingers to pick the core out. Discard once removed. It is not generally cooked or used for other dishes.

, The cut side of each half should face down.


The cut side is flat, so it'll be easier to hold the fennel still with the flat side against the cutting surface. If you have the rounded outer portion of the fennel facing down, it will rock back and forth as you attempt to cut it, creating choppy, uneven pieces.

, Each sliver should be about 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) thick.


The slices should be perpendicular to the fibers of the fennel bulb.

, Cut into the center of each quarter at an angle, removing a wedge-shaped piece from the center that extends from the top to the bottom.


Discard the core when done. It is not usually saved for other uses or dishes.

, One flat edge of each quarter should face down.


The cut sides of each quarter are flat and it will be easier to hold the fennel still with a flat side against the cutting surface. If you have the rounded outer portion of the fennel facing down, it will rock back and forth as you attempt to cut it, creating choppy, uneven pieces. You would also be more likely to accidentally cut yourself if the fennel were constantly moving back and forth.

, Use a sharp, smooth knife to chop the fennel quarters into tiny pieces. Separate the cut layers with your fingers to form even more pieces.


Finely chopped fennel should bee cut into 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) pieces.
Medium-sized chopped fennel should be cut into pieces that are 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) wide or smaller.
Coarsely-chopped fennel should be cut into pieces that are 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) wide or larger.
Fold your non-dominant hand into a loose fist or “cat's paw,” with your finger knuckles pointed outward. Place your hand on the fennel bulb in this position to protect your fingertips from the knife as you cut. Cut carefully so that you do not accidentally cutting yourself.

",How to Cut Leeks3," Chop off the bottom 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) of the leek and dark green leaves at the top. The remaining stalk should be white and light green.









You may also need to remove any tough outer leaves. These leaves will be difficult to slice into narrow strips and may have an unpleasant texture if consumed.
The dark green leaves are bitter and tough, which is why they are not typically eaten.

, Slice the leek into two equal halves, cutting from the bottom of the stalk to the top.








, Slice across the width of the stalk as many times as necessary to separate the entire stalk into smaller portions.








, The rounded side of each 2-inch (5-cm) section should face the cutting board and the flat side should face up.








, Make narrow lengthwise slices across each portion. The cuts should be similar in thickness to the width of each inner layer.









Use one hand to hold each section of leek in place as you cut. Place your hand across the width of the section and cut along the length, starting on the side opposite you. Gradually work your way across the width of the leek until you reach the side nearest you.
Use enough pressure as you hold the leek in place so that the layers begin to fan out and separate slightly.
Due to the thinness of these slices and the manner in which they are cut, you should not need to separate them after cutting the leek.

Cut through the center of the cabbage in one motion.









If you see worm holes or other signs of pests, soak the cabbage in salt water for 20 minutes before you continue., Any spherical cabbage (green, red, or Savoy) contains a tough, white stem unpleasant to eat. To remove it from each quarter of the cabbage, hold the piece vertically, with the V-shaped core at the base. Slice off the core in one diagonal cut. You don't need to cut deeply into the cabbage to remove this.









If you're making wedges, leave a thin white layer to hold the leaves together. You can leave the cabbage in quarters, or cut each one in half to make eight smaller wedges.

, Place a cabbage wedge flat on the cutting board. Bend your fingers inward and hold the wedge in place, so your knuckles are closer to the knife blade than your fingertips. Slice the cabbage through the outer leaves to the center. Cut in ¼ to ½"" (6 to 12 mm) slices for stews, or shred to ⅛"" (3 mm) thickness for sauerkraut or slaw.








You can also shred with a mandoline slicer, a grater with large holes, or a food processor's grating disk. Mandoline blades can be dangerous to inexperienced users, so select a model with a hand guard.You can slice across the wedge for short slices, or along the wedge for longer ones. Either way is fine for any recipe.

, For longest fridge life, leave cabbage whole until you plan to use it. If you have more than you can cook in one sitting, rub a lemon along the cut surface to prevent browning. Store in plastic wrap or an unsealed plastic bag, refrigerated, for up to two weeks.









Store shredded cabbage in a bowl, under cold water with a squeeze of lemon juice. Cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate.

Cut off the top.,
Cut off the bottom.,
Peel the squash.,
Slice the squash down the middle.,
Scoop out the seeds and pulp.,
Cut the halves in half.,
Cut the sections the squash into lengthwise strips.,
Cut the lengthwise strips crosswise.",How to Cut Butternut Squash1," It's important to work with a very sharp knife, since butternut squash is firm and smooth. A blunt knife could slip and cut you if you aren't careful. Use a thick, heavy knife to do the job.;
, Place the squash on a large cutting board. Hold the thicker end of the squash with one hand, and use the other to cut approximately 1/2 inch (1.2 cm) off the narrow end, just below the stem. The slice should be clean and even.

, Hold the narrow end of the squash and use your other hand to cut approximately 1/2 inch (about 1.2 cm) off the wider end.

, Now that you have a flat base to work with, it's time to peel off the rind. Use a vegetable peeler, or if you don't have one that's sturdy enough, a very sharp knife.


Stand the squash upright on its wider end. Hold it from the top with one hand and use the other to run the vegetable peeler in vertical strokes down the side of the squash.
Alternatively, you could hold the squash in one hand and use the vegetable peeler to remove the rind in horizontal strokes.

, Stand the squash upright on its wider end. Place the knife in the middle of the top of the squash and slice downward. Make one clean cut to slice the squash in two.


Cutting butternut squash can sometimes be difficult because the squash is dense and hard. If this is the case, gently tap the knife end with a rubber mallet to help it cut through the flesh of the squash.
If the mallet method doesn't work, you can switch to a serrated knife and use a sawing motion to cut the squash in half.

, Use a metal spoon to scoop the seeds and stringy pulp from the both halves of the squash. The seeds can be roasted like pumpkin seeds, so save them if you'd like.

, Lay both halves of the squash cut side down on the cutting board. Make a horizontal cut in each half, separating the bulbous end from the thin end. You should now have four parts of the butternut squash to work with.

, The thickness of your strips will vary depending on the specific recipe. Generally, the strips will range from 1/2 inch to 1 inch (about 1.2 cm to 2.5 cm).

, You could leave them as strips if you'd like, or cut them crosswise to create uniform butternut squash cubes.


If you want to save some time with the cubing process, stack several lengthwise strips on top of each other and cut them at the same time. If you utilize this technique, don't let the strips slip while cutting. This will create uneven cubes.
Keep in mind that the smaller you slice the squash, the more quickly the cubes will cook. Determine how small the pieces should be for the recipe you are using.

Identify the cabbage.,
Prep the cabbage.,
Halve the cabbage lengthwise.,
Hold a half in place with the claw position.,
Slice across the leaves and stem.,
Cut bok choy leaves (optional).",How to Cut Cabbage2," Chinese cabbage is a long, cylindrical vegetable that comes in two types. These requires slightly different approaches:


Napa cabbage looks similar to a head of Romaine lettuce, with thin, tightly packed leaves.Bok choy has a long, thick white stem with several branches. The leaves are dark green and clustered at one end.

, Rinse the cabbage and remove any wilted leaves. If cutting bok choy, chop off and discard a small chunk from the base. This brownish area where the stem branches meet tends to be tough and unpleasant.









You do not need to chop the base off Napa cabbage.

, Whichever variety you are using, place the cabbage on a stable cutting board. Cut the cabbage through the center of the stem with a large, stainless steel knife.









Avoid carbon steel knives, which can leave black marks on the cabbage.

, When chopping any vegetable, the ""claw"" position will protect your fingers from cuts. Curl your fingertips inward, so your knuckles are nearest the knife blade.

, Cut across the width of each half to make cabbage pieces as thin or thick as you desire. Thin shreds of ⅛"" (3 mm) are ideal for coleslaw or sauerkraut, but thicker slices are fine for soups, or if you have a dull knife.









Both the stem and leaves of napa cabbage and bok choy are edible.

, Some heads of bok choy have large, wide leaves. Cut these into more manageable pieces by slicing through the pile of leaves once or twice lengthwise.








The bok choy leaves may require less cooking time than the stems. Consider adding them 5–10 minutes after you start the stems.

Remove your plate and inspect the tomatoes to ensure they have all been cut in half.",How to Cut Cherry Tomatoes," Inspect them to ensure you are cutting only ripe, red tomatoes, disposing of any moldy or mushy ones. Dry the tomatoes well with a paper towel and you're ready to move on.;
, Try to fit as many as you can, but ideally you want a little bit of space between tomatoes. Don’t pile them on! You want to end up with a nice even layer of cherry tomatoes.

, This should completely cover the tomatoes. They should be snug underneath the second plate, and a thin gap between plates should be visible.

, You want to hold them firmly so the tomatoes don’t roll, but avoid pushing the plate down, as this will smash the tomatoes.

, Begin moving the knife through the gap, which should bring the blade through the tomato layer you created in step 2.

, If you have positioned the tomatoes correctly, you should have sliced through most of them!

, If you missed a few, just replace the plate and continue to cut until you get them all.

Make roasted butternut squash cubes.,
Make butternut squash soup.,
Cook it whole.",How to Cut Butternut Squash2," To roast butternut squash, season the cubes with a drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Roast the squash cubes in an oven heated to 350 °F (177 °C). Remove the squash from the oven when the cubes are soft on the inside and brown and crunchy on the outside.


Add savory spices, like cumin, chili powder or cayenne pepper, to make a spicy side dish.
Add sweet elements, like brown sugar, maple syrup or agave nectar, to make a delectable treat.

, Butternut squash soup has a silky, creamy texture, perfect for warming up on a winter night. To make it, follow these steps:


Roast butternut squash cubes in the oven until they are soft.
In the meantime, sauté a diced onion and a few cloves of minced garlic in some olive oil in a large soup pot on over medium heat on the stove.
Add the butternut squash and a quart of chicken or vegetable stock.
Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce it to a simmer, and cook for 20 minutes.
Season with salt and pepper to taste, then blend it in batches in the blender.
Serve with a drizzle of cream and some black pepper.

, If you want to skip the peeling process, you can bake a squash whole and cut it when it's soft. Poke a squash all over with a fork and place it on a baking sheet in an oven heated to 350 °F (177 °C). Bake the squash for about an hour, until it's tender when you poke it with a fork. Remove it from the oven, let it cool for a few minutes, and cut it into slices.

Purchase a cut of beef.,
Wash your hands thoroughly in preparation for cooking.,
Cook the meat to your liking.,
Allow the beef to rest.Place the steak to the side, and allow it to rest for a minimum of 3 to 5 minutes once it is cooked to your liking.,
Identify the grain.,
Place the meat on a cutting board.,
Cut away surface muscle.Muscle in a piece of beef will increase its chewiness.,
Trim off the fat.,
Mark your cuts.If you're cutting down a bigger piece of meat and want relatively equal-sized chunks, it's a good idea to measure out parts with a ruler.,
Hold your cut in place with a meat fork.,
Position a butcher's knife at an angle near the steak's endmost point.,
Cut the beef using a smooth, downward motion.,
Present the beef with your meal.,
Partially freeze your beef.,
Trim off the fat.,
Take extra care to make your cuts consistent.,
Cut in slow, smooth strokes.Setting your beef on a cutting board, cut down in a smooth, downward motion, much as you would with cutting cooked beef.,
Cook your beef as soon as possible.,
Wash your hands vigorously after cutting.",How to Cut Beef," Beef can be purchased at a butcher's shop or grocery store. For the sake of learning proper cutting, you should buy a cut with visible muscle, or ""grain"". The beef you use should depend on the meal you're preparing.


""Grain"" refers to the direction of the major muscle fibers on a cut of meat. It's not so important while you're cooking, but it's a crucial thing to consider when you cut the beef.The smaller the grain on the beef, the less important the slice's angle is. Cuts such as filet mignon or New York strip have softer muscle by definition, so slicing these types of meat may be a bit easier and more forgiving. If you are having difficulty learning to slice beef properly, these cuts are well suited for you.;
, Handwashing is a vital part of cooking preparation. Wash your hands with a disinfecting soap and lather them in water for at least 30 seconds. This will make sure you don't bring germs onto the food you're working with.


If you're handling uncooked meat at any point, make sure to wash your hands again afterwards.

, Lovers of steak all have their preferences when it comes to the degree of cooking. Ranging from rare (pink in the middle) to well-done (completely cooked), the level of cooking has a major effect on taste and texture. You can cook beef before or after it's been cut.


Different degrees of cooking, such as rare, medium rare, medium, medium well, and well done can also affect the meat's tenderness. Generally speaking, the longer you cook the meat, the less tender it is. Most steak lovers prefer medium rare as it offers an optimal balance.

, This allows the juices to redistribute inside your steak, which relaxes the muscle. Slicing steak prematurely allows these juices to escape.


Resting time should vary based on the cut and size of your beef. A roast, for example, should be allowed to rest for 10 minutes, while steaks should be given 5 to settle.Generally speaking, 1 minute of resting time per 100g of meat is a good rule if you're unsure how much time to let your beef idle., The ""grain"" of a cut of beef refers to the direction of major muscle fibers. You can usually see the direction visibly on beef, although less gamey cuts (like filet mignon) make be less clear. It's important to know where the grain is before cutting as you'll want to cut across the muscle. You'll increase the tenderness of your cut by severing the fibers.


Certain recipes might actually welcome some roughness in the meat, so long as the meat cuts are bite-sized. If this is the case, feel free to cut with the grain.
Don't confuse grill marks with the grain. Grill marks are the cooking lines that show where the steak was placed on the grill. Backyard cooks can sometimes confuse the grill marks as grain lines.

, For the sake of traction, safety, and protecting your countertop, it's recommended you put your meat on a cutting board before you do anything to it. This will minimize the risk of anything going astray while you're working on it., This includes connective tissue, which is often seen on the exterior of a cut of meat. Muscle (and fat) are both usually visibly distinct from the rest of the cut. Hold the beef with one hand, and cut the muscle by sawing it back at forth with a knife. When it's cut off, discard it away from the meat you're preparing.


Don't hack away at the muscle if you're losing too much beef.
If your beef has a lot of muscle on the outside, it's a good idea to cut it off before you cook.

, Different cuts carry different degrees of fat, and some recipes actually favour a bit of beef fat along with the steak. However, for certain dishes (like stir fry), the fat should be removed.It's ultimately up to you whether you'd prefer a lean or marbled cut. Too much fat can pose a health issue, but it does capture a lot of flavour.


This can be done prior to cooking the meat. If you do so before cooking, you're likely to get the cleanest possible cut.

, Take a ruler and measure out pieces of the beef. From there, make noticeable incisions. These will be a placemarker for you when you make each of the cuts, and save you having to bring out the ruler for each time.


Again, it is important to remember you want to mark your cuts against the grain of the muscle fibres.

, A meat fork helps ensure that your piece of beef won't slip while you're cutting it. This helps ensure your cut is smooth. More importantly, it limits the risk of the knife slipping and causing injury., Because a proper beef cut should be smooth, the only mindwork you'll need to do is with positioning the knife itself. Aim the far end of your knife for the far end of the meat, aiming it downward at an angle. Think of the knife as a guillotine or a paper cutter. When you begin to cut the beef, you'll want to keep the knife is the exact same position.


Having a proper butcher's knife makes the process of cutting beef a lot smoother. If you're regularly preparing meat in your cooking, it's a good idea to invest in a high-end knife set. Other utensils, like forks, don't usually warrant the same quality.

, Properly cutting beef should be a very smooth process. Push the knife down gently, rocking it back and forth slowly. Provided your knife is sharp enough, you shouldn't need a lot of force to do this. Keep working downward until the slice is severed from the rest of the cut. Set the beef aside, and move on to the next segment until you're done.


Again, don't forget to cut against the grain. This has an important effect on the meat's texture., Aesthetics during mealtime are often underrated, but they have a big impact on the way food is received. If you're serving multiple pieces of meat per dish, it's a good idea to serve them together. If you're bringing the beef out on a platter, it can be appetizing to reassemble them in the shape of the original cut. This increases the impression of freshness.

, Raw beef is notoriously difficult to cut. However, you can alleviate some of the strain by placing the beef in the freezer. Partially freezing beef firms up the meat, making it easier to work with.Put your meat in the freezer for 30 minutes to an hour. The extra time you put into preparing it will make the cutting process that much easier for you.

, One thing about cutting beef while raw is that you're able to cut off potentially unwanted parts (like muscle and fat) without their flavour sinking into the rest of the cut during the cooking process. Slide your knife under the surface fat and take it off in a smooth motion. Take care not to go too deep with your cuts. Getting too aggressive with your fat trimming will result in the loss of good meat.Membrane is a fine film over parts of some cuts, and can be peeled off with your hands.Consider leaving some of the fat on your cut. Even if you want to keep your beef lean, a bit of fat will keep your cut of beef juicy.

, If you haven't yet cooked your beef, it's all the more important that you make your cuts consistent. If you're cutting pieces of different sizes, they'll cook at different rates.This will run the risk of undercooking (or overcooking!) parts of your beef.


It helps to mark your cuts beforehand. Because consistent size is so important with pre-cooked cutting, you should get the measurements done before you set a knife to your beef.

, Although raw beef is generally harder to cut, pre-freezing it partially helps ease some of the difficulty.

, If you plan on cutting the beef before cooking it, only cut it if you're planning on cooking immediately after. Slicing in advance will increase oxidation and make the meat taste off., Raw beef carries lots of bacteria with it. Whenever you're handling raw meat, it is strongly recommended you wash your hands thoroughly afterwards. Lather your hands with anti-bacterial soap under hot water for at least 30 seconds. Dry your hands off with a towel afterwards.

Cut the squash into wedges.,
Cut the squash into cubes.,
Cut the squash into rings.,
Refrigerate the squash.,
Roast acorn squash halves.,
Make an acorn squash puree.,
Cook rings of acorn squash.",How to Cut Acorn Squash," Since acorn squashes are notoriously hard to cut, you'll need a sharp, long chef's knife for this job. The knife will need to be long enough to cut through most of the squash, so choose a knife that's about 8 to 10 inches. The blade should be sturdy and sharp. Using the right, sharp knife will help you easily slice through the squash and prevent injury to your fingers.


If you don't have a sharp chef's knife, you can use a serrated knife or a cleaver. Regardless of which knife you choose, it needs to be sharp in order to cut through the hard squash.;
, Carefully use a sharp chef's knife to cut 1/2 an inch off of both ends of the squash. This will help keep the squash in place and prevent it from rolling as you cut it. You can throw the ends of the squash away.To keep your cutting board from slipping, lay a damp washcloth on the counter. Set your cutting board on top of the cloth. The moist cloth will keep the cutting board from moving as you cut.

, Place the acorn squash on a cutting board so that the sliced end is level on the cutting board. Carefully take the sharp knife and use a rocking or sawing motion to cut the squash in half right down the middle. Avoid chopping right into the squash. Instead, you can try cutting through a quarter of the squash, turning the squash, and continuing the cut on the other side.If you're having trouble cutting through the squash, try using a rubber mallet and a knife. Insert the knife into the rind of the squash and tap the knife with the rubber mallet. This will split the acorn squash.
Always keep your fingers away from the knife as you cut to prevent injury.

, Take a large spoon and scoop out all of the seeds and membrane from each of the acorn squash halves. It may help to use a metal spoon or a firm-handled spoon that won't snap as you scoop out the seeds.You can throw away the seeds or save them to roast.

, Place one half of your acorn squash seed-side down on the cutting board. Cut the squash into 1/2 to 3/4 inch slices by carefully cutting across the ridges.You don't need to peel acorn squash before cutting or preparing it.
Slicing the acorn squash thinly ensures that it will cook faster than if you simply roast half of the squash or bake large wedges of squash.

, To make large wedges, lay one half of your squash seed-side down on the cutting board. Carefully cut lengthwise along each ridge of the acorn squash to make wedges. Cutting the squash into wedges keeps more of its rustic shape and gives you larger pieces to serve.If you'd like to peel your acorn squash, you should cut them into wedges first. This will make it easier to hold the squash while peeling.

, If you need cubed or chunked acorn squash for a recipe, start by cutting the squash into wedges. Once you've sliced the wedges, you can peel each individual wedge. Lay the wedge so that one side lays flat on a cutting board. Take a knife and cut each wedge into cubes or chunks.


You can cut the cubes or chunks to any size you would like. Keep in mind that if you're roasting the squash with other root vegetables, you should keep them all the same size.

, When cutting your acorn squash in half, ensure that you cut it crosswise. Once you've scooped out the seeds from both halves, take a sharp knife and cut the squash in half crosswise again. This will make one ring. Continue cutting rings until you reach the end on each half of the squash.You can cut the rings as thick as you like. Many recipes call for the rings to be sliced between 1/2 and inch and 1 inch.

, You should use the acorn squash as soon as you've cut it since it will begin to lose flavor and health benefits. But if you can't use the acorn squash the same day you cut it, wrap the squash in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for up to four days.You can also freeze the cut squash for several months. To do so, wrap the acorn squash in plastic and place it in an air-tight freezer bag. Label the bag and use the squash before you see ice crystals form.

, Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (218 C). Rub a few tablespoons of olive oil over several halves of acorn squash with the seeds removed. Sprinkle the flesh with salt and pepper. Place these on baking sheet flesh-side down. Roast the squash for 15 to 20 minutes or until they're soft. If you'd like to try a unique flavor, consider seasoning your acorn squash with one of these combinations:Sesame seeds and cumin
Cinnamon and butter
Balsamic vinegar and shallots

, For a quick puree, roast the acorn squash in halves. Once the roasted squash is cool enough to handle, just scoop out the flesh and mash it in a serving bowl along with butter, salt and pepper. For an even smoother consistency, you can beat it with a hand mixer.


You can also steam the acorn squash before pureeing it. To steam the squash, heat about an inch of water in a saute pan. Add cubed acorn squash and let it cook over medium-high heat until it's tender (about 10 minutes).

, Take 1/2 inch rings or slices of acorn squash and combine them with a few teaspoons of melted butter or olive oil. Place the squash in a saute pan that you can also place in the oven. Cover the pan and cook the squash over medium-high heat for 15 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake them at 400 degrees F (204 C) for 15 more minutes.If you'd like a slightly sweet caramelized flavor, add a few tablespoons of brown sugar to the squash before you bake them.

Order Coke to look like a rum and Coke, or get Sprite or soda water to look like a gin and tonic or vodka tonic, for example. Ask for a straw, too, and a lemon or lime wedge if it’s a clear soda. You may also want to ask for it in a short glass., Ask for a ginger ale, without ice, in a pint glass to make it appear like a draft beer.

, Ask for a non-alcoholic beer at the bar, and have them pour it into a glass so people don’t see the label., Order or pour your own apple or white grape juice into a wine glass to look like white wine, regular grape juice to look like red wine, or sparkling white grape or pear juice to look like champagne., If you’re at friend’s house or house party, bring along a regular soda, juice, or tea bottle and drink from that, explaining to anyone who asks that it’s mixed with alcohol.

Pour out a beer and fill it with water.,
Slowly empty a drink.,
Spit alcohol into another bottle.,
Fake taking a shot.",How to Pretend to Drink Alcohol2," Take a beer bottle or can with you to a restroom and dump the contents down the sink or toilet. Then refill it with water from the tap and drink that instead. No one will be able to see the difference through the brown bottle or metal can.


Be sure to rinse the bottle or can out at least once before you fill it with the water you intend to drink, to get rid of any residual alcohol in the bottle or can.

, If you have an alcoholic drink, hold onto it and, very occasionally, find opportunities to get rid of a small amount at a time. Pour some into the sink in the bathroom, a trash can nearby, or someone else’s finished drink cup. Don’t get rid of too much at a time, or leave too often to empty it.


Put your mouth to the drink occasionally without actually drinking any so it doesn’t look suspicious that your drink is disappearing on its own.
Tell a friend (or several), “Mmm, this is good, try this!” and have them take a sip so your drink disappears faster.

, If you have a drink with alcohol, keep a water, soda, or tea bottle nearby. Take a sip of the alcoholic drink, but hold it in your mouth without swallowing. Keep it there for at least 30 seconds, then pretend to drink from the other bottle, instead backwashing the alcohol into it at the end. Explain that you’re just trying to hydrate and avoid a hangover, if anyone asks.

, If you’re offered a shot of alcohol, pour it out in a trash can, plant, or empty cup when no one is looking or while others are doing their shots. Hold your hand around the shot glass to disguise that there’s nothing in it, then pretend to take the shot.


If you can’t get away with pouring the shot out, take it but don’t swallow it. Reach for a soda bottle (preferably your own personal one) and pretend to drink from it as a chaser, backwashing the alcohol from your mouth instead."

Wash the oranges under running water and scrub the skin with a vegetable brush. This will remove dirt and other particles from the skin.

You can also use clementines or mandarin oranges to make your homemade blue curaçao.Use six smaller oranges in place of the larger naval oranges.;
, Dry the oranges with a clean towel. Use a vegetable peeler to peel the outer orange rind from the fruit. Don’t peel any of the white pith underneath, as this will make the drink bitter and unpleasant.

If any pith comes off with the rind, shave it off using a paring knife., Transfer the orange peel slices to a large glass jar, such as a mason jar. Pour the white grape juice, apple cider vinegar, peach syrup, and apricot syrup over the orange peels. Cover the jar with a tight-fitting lid.

The juice, vinegar, and syrups used in this recipe replace the vodka and brandy that’s usually used to make blue curaçao.If you can't find peach or apricot syrup, replace the quantities with more white grape juice.

, Place the jar with the orange peels and juice in a cool, dry, and dark location. A pantry or dry basement is ideal. Leave the orange peels to steep in the juice solution for three weeks.Stir the contents of the jar each week, and then place the lid back on and return the jar to its spot.

As the orange peels and juice mingle, the juice will become infused with orange flavor. The vinegar and sugar will help to preserve the solution as it steeps.

, After three weeks, remove the lid from the jar. Add the cloves to the solution. Put the lid back on and return the jar to its cool and dry location. Leave the mixture for one more day.This will give the cloves time to infuse some spiciness into the liquid, but not so long that the clove flavor becomes overpowering.

Other spices you can add in place of or in addition to the cloves include a cinnamon stick and a tablespoon (6 g) of coriander seeds., In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and water. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar is dissolved. When the mixture boils and the sugar is dissolved, remove the pan from the heat. Set it aside and let the syrup cool for about an hour., As the syrup cools, remove the lid from the juice and orange peel mixture. Prepare a fine-mesh strainer by lining it with cheesecloth and placing it over a clean bowl. Strain the juice through the cheesecloth to remove the orange peels and spices. Discard the peels and cloves.

You can also use a disposable coffee filter to strain the mixture if you don’t have cheesecloth., When the syrup has cooled to room temperature, pour it into the bowl with the strained orange-infused juice mixture. Add blue food coloring in five-drop increments, stirring with a long spoon after each addition. Continue adding color until your blue curaçao reaches the desired shade of blue., Clean the mason jar that you used to infuse your orange base. Once all the ingredients have been combined, return the blue mixture to the mason jar. Cover the jar and return the mixture to its cool and dry spot. Leave the mixture to settle for another 24 hours.This final rest will allow all of the ingredients and flavors to properly marry and combine.

, After 24 hours, you can transfer the mixture to a pourable bottle. Clean an old glass bottle with soap and water to remove any residue. Rinse the bottle and let it air dry. Fit a funnel into the neck of the bottle and pour the blue curaçao from the mason jar into the bottle., Once the blue curaçao is in a pourable bottle with a tight-fitting lid, it’s ready to enjoy. You can drink it on its own, on ice, or in your favorite drinks and cocktails. Screw on the lid tightly and store leftovers in the refrigerator for about two months., Blue curaçao is a common ingredient in many colorful cocktails and mocktails. To make a basic soda or mocktail, fill a tall glass halfway with ice. Add a lemon wedge and five fresh mint leaves. Then stir in:2 tablespoons (30 ml) blue curaçao
2 tablespoons (30 ml) liquid syrup or sugar, such as simple syrup, maple syrup, or agave
Soda water to fill the glass

, Crush 10 mint leaves with your hands to bruise them and release the flavor. Transfer them to a serving glass. Add two lemon rind curls, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, a teaspoon (5 ml) of ginger juice, and ¼ cup (59 ml) of blue curaçao. Stir the ingredients together with ice and top the glass off with soda water., In a martini shaker, combine five ice cubes, ½ cup (118 ml) pineapple juice, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) coconut extract, and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of blue curaçao. Shake everything together in the martini shaker and strain the drink into a serving glass filled with crushed ice., In a tall glass, combine 2 teaspoons (10 ml) each of blue curaçao, blackberry concentrate, and grenadine. Stir the mixture together, and fill the glass the rest of the way with ice and soda water or sparkling apple juice."

Have soda in moderation.",How to Find Healthier Alternatives to Soda," Sparkling water has become a very popular soda replacement over the last few years. Sales have nearly doubled in the US of sparkling waters, seltzer and even tonic water.Try replacing your favorite soda with sparkling water instead.


Plain, unflavored sparkling water is a great alternative to sodas. It's naturally sugar-free, calorie-free and can help keep you hydrated during the day.
There are flavored sparkling waters available as well. Always read the nutrition label to make sure they do not have any added sugars or sodium to them.
If they are zero calories, but flavored, they may still have added artificial sweeteners. If you're OK with consuming artificial sweeteners, these sugar-free flavored beverages are a great alternative.
Sparkling water should be OK for most people; however, health professionals note that if you suffer from IBS or chronic bloating, sparkling water can increase feelings of bloating.;
, Another great option for soda lovers is to make your own sodas at home. You can purchase all-natural ingredients and make flavorful sparkling beverages that are the perfect soda replacement.


If you really crave a flavored, bubbly beverage, consider mixing together either tonic, seltzer or sparkling water with your favorite fruit juice. Fruit juice contains a lot of sugar (even 100% fruit juice), so limit your intake to 4 oz.
Make sure to choose 100% fruit juice. Fruit juice cocktails or fruit juice mixes may have added sugar to them and will be much higher in calories.
To keep total calories and sugar low overall, only mix in about 1/4 cup 100% fruit juice in with about 8 – 10 oz of sparkling water.

, If you enjoy those flavored bubbly beverages more often, consider purchasing an at-home soda maker. These little machines can be convenient and help you make more nutritious beverages right in your own home.


There are many different brands of soda makers for home use. They require a carbonation capsule and specialty bottles; however, you just use regular tap or bottled water for your sodas.
Most of the companies sell soda-flavored syrups and other flavorings to make your sodas, though you may wish to avoid these, as they may be loaded with sugar and other artificial sweeteners. Be careful of what you buy as some are still full of chemicals like ""caramel coloring"" or high fructose corn syrup.There are some brands of these syrups that are all-natural and do not contain any artificial sweeteners, preservatives or flavorings.
You can also just use your soda machine to make homemade carbonated water. Then you can use it along with 100% fruit juice or homemade simple syrups to make flavored beverages.

, Another fun option to replace sodas is to make or purchase sparkling iced tea. This is a newly available product in stores, but also easy to make at home.


Sparkling iced tea is just like soda; however, instead of a sugar syrups and other additives, it's just iced tea that has been carbonated.
If you do purchase a sparkling iced tea in the grocery store, make sure to read the food label. Some may have added sugar — like a sweetened tea would — where others are unsweetened and do not have any added sugars.
If you want to make sparkling iced tea at home, you can try steeping tea bags in carbonated water. Make sure after placing your tea bags in the sparkling water, you reseal it to keep it from going flat.
You can also brew cold unsweetened iced tea and use that in your soda maker as well to make it carbonated.

, One reason that some people do not enjoy drinking water and choose a flavored beverage like soda is for the flavor itself. Water doesn't really taste like much; however, if you get creative and spike or infuse your water with flavor, these can be a great and nutritious alternative to sodas.


Infuse your water with fruit, vegetables or herbs. This allows natural flavors and even some vitamins to seep into your water. Leave a pitcher of water in the fridge with your favorite sliced fruits or herbs.For example, you can mix together sliced strawberries and basil or cucumbers and mint. It gives your water a hint of flavor without any added sugars or calories.
You may also consider adding some of those powdered or liquid flavoring agents. These typically do have artificial sweeteners, but do not contain any added sugars or calories. If you're OK using some artificial sweeteners, these may be a good option as well.

, You may not think that coffee or tea would be an acceptable replacement for sodas; however, when these items are decaf, it's more or less just flavored water and can help hydrate you throughout the day.


Although caffeinated coffee is something you shouldn't drink unlimited amounts of, decaf coffee is a great and flavorful alternative to sodas.
Coffee has natural compounds and antioxidants that have been shown to lower depression and even help prevent cardiovascular disease or diabetes.Like coffee, tea (especially green) tea has been associated with some great health benefits — like cancer, diabetes and heart disease prevention.As long as tea and coffee are served decaffeinated and without any added sugars, both are great alternatives to sodas.

, Although you might not consider milk as a hydrating beverage, it's actually a great drink to have. It's full of nutrients and protein and can help you stay hydrated.


Studies have shown that milk is actually about 87% water. If you're not in the mood for plain water and need to limit soda, you might enjoy a glass of milk instead.In addition to being a good source of water, milk is also high in protein, calcium, Vitamin D, phosphorus, potassium and Vitamin A.
There's been some back and forth between the types of milk you should drink. If you're watching calories, a lower fat milk will be the lowest calorie choice.

, Kombucha is a more uncommon beverage. This slightly sweet and sour fermented tea does have a bit of carbonation to it. If you want a bubbly sensation, try kombucha.


Kombucha has had many positive health effects associated with it. A few studies show that it has antioxidants in it as well as probiotics (which are great for your digestion).Try looking for kombucha in your local grocery store or in a health food store.
Kombucha does have added sugar in it (to help the yeast and bacteria ferment), so it contains calories; however, it's usually a natural form of sugar and not an artificial sweetener or high fructose corn syrup.

, Last but not least, there's always water. Although it might not be the most exciting alternative to soda, it is the most recommended beverage by health professionals.


If you're trying to find a healthier beverage alternative, water is always something you should try to include more of. It's a naturally sugar-free, calorie-free beverage that has no chemical additives or preservatives.Although there are a lot of flavorings or other things you can add to water, the best option is to drink it plain.

, If you're trying to replace sodas with a more nutritious beverage alternative, it's also important to make sure you're drinking enough fluids in general. It's important to aim to be hydrated everyday.


Most health professionals recommend that you consume a minimum of eight glasses (64 oz or 1.9 L) of clear fluids daily; however, this is just a general guideline.Some people may need more or less fluid. For example, if you're active, you may need up to 10 or 12 glasses (2.4 or 96 L) of water a day. Or if you're pregnant, you may need at least 10 glasses (2.4 L) of water daily.
Also, only certain types of fluids will count towards your eight or 10 glasses. Things like caffeinated coffee, soda, alcohol or other sweetened beverages do not count.

, One important tip to help you stay hydrated is to keep water or some other hydrating beverage on you at all times. This can help cue you to drink.


Consider purchasing a reusable water bottle. These plastic or stainless steel bottles are convenient and allow you to carry water and fill up anywhere.
You may also want to keep a water bottle with you in the car and even leave one on your desk at work. That way there's always a source of water near by.

, Soda definitely has gotten a bad reputation of the years for being a cause for childhood obesity and type 2 diabetes; however, sodas not the only beverage you should be wary of.Any beverage that has added sugar will be higher in calories. In addition, these beverages do not count towards the recommended 64 oz (1.9 L) of fluids daily.
All sweetened beverages, including sodas, can increase your risk for type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure.
Also try to limit beverages like: sweetened coffee, sweet tea, alcohol, fruit juice (blends and 100%), energy drinks and sports drinks.

, Although drinking soda in large quantities or on a regular basis isn't recommended, that doesn't mean you have to avoid it completely. If you truly enjoy soda, having it every once in awhile hasn't been proven to be harmful.If you want to include some soda in your diet, decide whether or not you want to drink regular or diet soda. Regular soda has added calories and sugars, and diet soda has no calories, but does have artificial sweeteners. Pick whichever one fits into your diet plan most successfully.
You may also want to consider drinking all-natural sodas. These are ones that do not have any artificial flavors, colors or preservatives. In addition, they generally use a less processed form of sugar, like cane sugar.
Also decide what moderation is for you. Is it one soda a week? Or is it just a few times a month? Stick to whatever definition of moderation you decide.

Crumple the leaves in your hands if you are absolutely opposed to muddling.",How to Make a Virgin Mojito1," Unless you are a bartender, you probably don't have a muddler lying around, but muddling the mint is an essential part of making a good mojito. If you don't have a muddler, you can improvise with a wooden spoon or even the end of a rolling pin.If you do have a muddler, make sure it is made of unfinished wood. Anything that has been varnished or lacquered will eventually wear down, and the finish will end up in your drinks.;
, You can add the sugar as well, as the rough texture can actually help the muddling process.Make sure the glass you are using isn't thin or delicate or it could break during the process.Make sure you remove the leaves from the stems, as these will also give the drink a bitter taste.Spearmint is the type of mint most often used in a mojito, but you can experiment with peppermint or pineapple mint for different flavors., You do not want to shred, crush, or mince the leaves, as this will release the chlorophyll contained in the veins of the leaf. Chlorophyll is very bitter and will make your virgin mojito taste quite unpleasant., The purpose of muddling is to release the fragrant and tasty oils in the leaves, and roughing them up a bit will allow them to seep out and infuse your drink.Muddling the leaves with sugar will allow the oils to seep into the sugar, adding more depth to the drink., This is better than chopping the mint, which would release the chlorophyll, and also leave little bits of mint floating around in your beverage.

To make sure you get as much juice as possible, place the lime on the counter and roll it underneath the palm of your hand, pressing down slightly. This will soften the lime and make it easier to squeeze.Cut the lime in half and place one half in an open hinged hand-held lemon or lime squeezer.

If your lime juice is room-temperature, the sugar may begin to dissolve into the liquid.









If you want to deviate from the classic Mojito, now is the time! Try adding apple juice, pink grapefruit juice, lemonade, strawberry puree, or other fruit juices.

, Strawberries come in different sizes, so how many strawberries you use will vary. This could be anywhere from 3 to 6 strawberries. A simple way to figure out how many strawberries you'll need is to simply cut and slice some strawberries and start filling up a measuring cup. Stop when you are just short of the ½ cup/4 ounces/120 millimeters mark.


The best strawberries are fresh and ripe, but you can also use frozen ones as well.If you do use frozen strawberries, thaw them first., For a sweeter daiquiri, add some more sugar. Keep in mind that if the strawberries are already very ripe, you may not need much sugar.

, From time to time, open the blender, and push the mixture down the sides with a spatula. This will help things mix more evenly.

, Slice a strawberry partway, from the bottom almost to the top. Slide it over the rim of the glass.You can also use other garnishes as well, including mint leaves, paper cocktail umbrellas, or orange/lime slices.
For a fancier twist, add a swirl of whipped cream on top, and place a maraschino cherry on top.

If you notice any seeds, remove them from the slices.You will not be using the core in your apple juice, so throw that away when you're done.
Apple skin does contain some fiber, so you don't need to peel the apple if you don't want to. Your juice will taste just as good with the skin still on.;
, Peel the skin from the oranges first. You can then use your fingers to pull the oranges apart into individual sections. Oranges are divided into sections naturally, so it's usually not necessary to use a knife when cutting oranges., How you do this precisely depends on your juicer. Usually, you will put a cup or pitcher down where the juice comes out. Then, you will feed the fruit into the machine and collect the juice as you go.The order does not matter. You can put either the apples or oranges first.
Once you've collected the apple and orange juice, use a spoon to mix the two juices together.

You do not need to peel the apples if you don't want to do so.

, If you're working with bigger fruit, add around 1/2 a cup of water. Bigger pieces of fruit will require around 3/4 a cup of water. As you probably want your juice cold, use colder water.

Avoid making juice a staple of your diet.,
Talk to your doctor about juice if you have diabetes.,
Wash your fruit before juicing it.",How to Make an Apple and Orange Juice Drink3," While juice can be a great treat, it does not contain the same vitamins and nutrients as whole fruit. A lot of fiber gets removed when straining out the pulp from your fruits and you end up with more sugar than anything. While juice can be a great treat once in awhile, do not rely on it as a source of fruits in your diet. You should aim to eat whole fruit each day., If you have diabetes, you need to be careful about your sugar intake. Fiber from fruit can help with diabetes, but much of this fiber is lost in the juicing process. However, juice does contain some vitamins that can be beneficial, so talk to your doctor about how much juice you should be drinking.Make sure you ask your doctor how much juice per week is safe for you.
As with anyone, juice should be more of an occasional treat than a staple of your diet.

, This is especially important if you're not peeling your apples before adding them to your mix. Before washing your fruit, wash your own hands for 20 seconds using clean running water and soap.Hold your fruit under the faucet.

, The core should run the length of each cut face.

,, By doing so you slice through the middle of each of the many, many tiny capsules that hold its juice, each of which runs from the core toward the outside of the fruit.

, Because the cuts are away from the center of the fruit the seeds are unlikely to be ejected but pick them out if they are. Depending on how the cuts were made, the central part of the fruit may be ejected but it should all be together and easily picked out. If the cut edges are squeezed together, up and inwards the central part may be less likely to be ejected.

, The husk can be fed to a garbage disposer to deodorize it while making it go away, composted, thrown away, or given to an animal capable of digesting it such as a cow.

Look for a small or medium-sized jicama with brown skin. It should be slightly shiny, rather than dull. Choose a root without any blemishes or soft spots.


The smaller jicama are younger and sweeter. If you want a starchier taste, choose a larger jicama, though it might be a bit woody in texture.
The jicama should be heavy for its size. If it feels light, it has probably been sitting there for a long time, and the moisture has started to evaporate.
Jicama are not seasonal, so you should be able to find a good selection all year round.;
, Use a vegetable scrubber or a clean cloth wet with water to scrub the skin of the jicama. The skin will be removed, since it isn't edible, but you want to clean off all the dirt before peeling.

, It's easy to use a potato or carrot peeler to do the job. Peel all traces of the skin from the jicama, since ingesting the skin could give you a stomach ache.

, Use a sharp knife to slice the jicama into small sticks, discs, chunks, or wedges - whatever shape works for the recipe you're using. You'll find the texture to be similar to that of a potato. The flesh should be firm, without any give.

, If you don't immediately use the jicama, you can keep it fresh longer and avoid discoloration by submerging the processed jicama in a bowl of cold water with a squeeze of lemon juice. The citric acid in the juice will help keep the jicama in good shape for up to 2 days if you store it in the refrigerator.

, Jicama is a crunchy, flavorful, bright addition to any type of salad. Slice it into thin sticks or small cubes and simply toss it into your salad along with your other favorite mix-ins. Jicama pairs especially well with citrusy dressings.


Raw jicama is great in fruit salads, dipped into salsa, lettuce-based salads, chicken salad, pasta salad or just about any other application you can imagine.

, This popular use for raw jicama is a great accompaniment to steak or fish. Slice a small jicama into small sticks, then toss it with the following ingredients to create a delicious slaw:


1/2 head of cabbage, chopped
1 large carrot, shredded
1/2 cup lime juice
2 tablespoons vinegar
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 cup grapeseed or canola oil
Salt, pepper, and other spices to taste

, If you have a particularly ripe, sweet jicama, a great way to serve it is in the form of chips. This makes a very healthy appetizer or side dish. Simply slice the jicama into thin, bite-sized discs. Arrange them in an attractive pattern on a serving platter and squeeze lime juice over the chips. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and chili powder.

,, The flesh of a jicama is just as good cooked as it is raw. Roasting it makes it taste slightly sweeter. Try roasting a jicama in place of potatoes or sweet potatoes. To do so, use the following method:


Preheat the oven to 400 °F (204 °C).
Peel and cube the jicama.
Toss the cubes with 1/4 cup cooking oil, salt and pepper, and your favorite spices.
Roast the jicama cubes for 15 minutes.

, Sauteed jicama makes for a unique and delectable side dish. Peel and cube a jicama, then heat some oil in a saucepan and Sauté the jicama until it turns golden brown. Season it with salt and pepper to taste.

, Jicama is a great vegetable to substitute for water chestnuts or potatoes in a stir fry. Chop your jicama into bite-sized pieces, then add it to the frying pan with other cut vegetables like snow peas, carrots, and green beans. Dress the stir fry with soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, and sesame oil.

, Jicama can be added to just about any soup or stew recipe. Cut the jicama into small cubes and add it to your favorite soup recipe, or toss it the cubes in near the end of a stew's cooking time.

, Mashed jicama can be used as a substitute for mashed potatoes. Simply peel the jicama, then cube it and boil it in lightly salted water. Add a peeled and crushed garlic clove for extra flavor. Simmer the jicama until it is fork tender, then drain it and mash it with a potato masher. Add butter and milk or cream and stir until the mash is light and fluffy.

Choose a ceramic baking dish or ramekins to make it easier to invert the flan onto a plate. Use cooking spray or a little butter to grease the inside of the dish or ramekins., Place a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Pour in the sugar and allow it to slowly caramelize. This will take about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir it frequently and do not leave unattended, since the sugar can get very hot and burn quickly.


Remove the sugar from heat when it has liquefied and turned golden brown. If you continue to cook it past this stage, the caramel may burn.
Do not let it stand too long before pouring, or it will begin to harden.

, Pour carefully, since the hot caramel could burn your skin. Tilt the dish you are using to coat the bottom evenly with caramel. After pouring, let the caramel stand for 10 minutes or more before you add the flan mixture.

, Stir together the condensed milk and the evaporated milk in a mixing bowl until they're thoroughly combined. Beat the eggs into the mixture, one at a time. The finished mixture should be light, fluffy and creamy.


Be sure the eggs and milk are completely mixed.
For added flavor, pour in a teaspoon of vanilla or lemon essence., Be sure that ten minutes have elapsed since you added the caramel. Then pour the flan mixture into dish so that it rises up the sides.

,, A bain marie is a water bath that helps the flan cook evenly and prevents it from cracking by creating a humid environment in the oven. To make one, pour hot water into a large, wide pan into which you can fit the baking dish or ramekins. Set the baking dish or ramekins into the water bath.


Make sure the water isn't so deep that it rises up the sides of the baking dish or ramekins. You don't want water to get into your flan.
A roasting pan makes a good bain marie pan.

, Lower the bain marie carefully into the oven and place it on the rack. Bake for one hour. The flan is ready when the custard (your milk and egg mixture) has set. Test it by jiggling the pan; if it seems set in the middle, it's ready. If it looks watery there, give it more time.Check on the flan every 15 minutes or so to make sure the water in the bain marie doesn't start to boil. This could cause the flan to overcook. If it begins to simmer or boil, add cold water to cool it down.
After the flan is ready, allow it to cool on the counter for about 10 minutes.

, Place the cooled flan in the refrigerator so it will firm up. Keep it there until the flan is cold. This will make it much easier to unmold the flan.

, Run a knife around edges of the flan. Wet the knife first with warm water so it won't drag against the custard. Place a large, rimmed serving platter on top of the flan pan. Holding both the platter and the flan pan, carefully invert the flan onto the platter.

, Cut it into wedges or spoon it onto dessert plates. Spoon extra caramel sauce from the baking dish over each serving. Serve with whipped cream and honey, if desired.

, While you’re waiting for the water to boil, prepare the lemon juice. Slice the lemons in half, then squeeze each lemon half over a clean bowl. Squeeze until the fruit stops yielding juice.


Check your bowl for lemon seeds and discard any that may have fallen in.
Set the freshly squeezed lemon juice aside for now.

, After the grated ginger has steeped in the hot water for 15 minutes it will need to be removed. Hold a mesh strainer over a large bowl or pitcher. Carefully pour the hot water through the strainer.


The water will go into the bowl and the grated ginger pieces will be caught in the strainer.
Discard the grated ginger bits after straining them out.

, Pour your freshly squeezed lemon juice into the bowl or pitcher of hot ginger water. Stir gently to combine the ingredients. You will have six to eight servings. Pour one serving into a mug and serve immediately. Sip on the remaining mixture throughout the day, warming it up in the microwave if necessary.


Add a spoonful of honey (or to taste) to your mug, if you like. Honey will coat and soothe a sore throat.
If you have any leftovers, put the liquid in an airtight container and place it in the refrigerator. The beverage will be good for up to three days.

Boil the water and slice the lemon.,
Measure out the honey and bourbon.,
Pour the boiling water into the mug.,
Allow the mixture to steep for five minutes.",How to Make a Hot Soothing Lemon Drink3," Put a kettle of water on to boil. Use a sharp knife to slice one lemon in half. Cut a circular slice about ¼ inch thick. If you like, you can take one of the halves, squeeze out the juice and add that to your beverage with the slice. Set the slice aside for now.

, Place both ingredients into a mug. If you have a sore throat, the honey can help to coat and soothe it.

, Once the water begins to boil, remove it from heat and pour it over the honey and bourbon. Drop the lemon slice into the mug, along with one cinnamon stick and three whole cloves. Cinnamon can help relieve pain from a sore throat. It's also very high in antioxidants and the scent of cinnamon can help to open up clogged sinuses.The cloves can relieve pain and they have antibacterial properties, too.
Do not substitute clove oil for the whole cloves. The oil might upset your stomach.

, Stir the liquid gently with the cinnamon stick or a spoon. Let it steep. Sprinkle the drink with nutmeg and serve immediately. Stir the beverage once more. Take a pinch of nutmeg and sprinkle it over the top and serve the beverage immediately.


Feel free to remove the cloves before consuming, although they are perfectly safe to swallow and may provide additional health benefits.You can always add lemon juice or additional honey to taste, if you like.

,
Slice the strawberries.,
Store strawberries in the refrigerator.",How to Prepare and Use Strawberries1," Avoid shriveled, dried up or moldy berries. Avoid soggy strawberries too as this means they are past their prime. A good strawberry should be firm and shiny. (Choose organic, if available, as strawberries are listed on the ""Dirty Dozen"" list of fruits and veggies most pesticide-laden.)


Some cooks believe smaller strawberries have more flavor due to a higher concentration of sugars.;
, Rub the berries gently under running water to make sure each berry is clean and free of as much soil as possible. Most strawberries sold at the grocery store are fairly clean so a good rinsing should do the trick.

,,, Sweeten with a sprinkling of superfine sugar if desired, and use within two hours of preparation. Keep the strawberries refrigerated until ready to serve.

, They will keep for up to 7 days after purchase. Do not wash and prepare the strawberries until ready to use.

Make strategic use of leftovers.,

Use natural ""convenience"" foods.,

Freeze your own pizza or pizza dough (unbaked or pre-baked for about 3 minutes).,

Freeze your own waffles.,

Pack leftovers in portion-sized amounts in microwaveable containers.
Use separate containers, if you prefer, for sauces and to keep foods separate.;
,

Fresh and dried fruits are healthy and natural, and they generally need no additional packaging.
Nuts and seeds are likewise easy, portable snacks.
Peel and slice your own carrots rather than buy the ""baby"" carrots. They are the same thing, except that the latter have had the skins shaved off and are packaged in a bag.

, You can control what sorts of things you put in or on your homemade pizza, and you can make up several batches at a time. You can freeze the dough cooked or uncooked, or you can freeze the entire, cooked pizza., Homemade waffles are not difficult to make, but you probably don't have time to make them as you rush out the door Monday morning. Try making up a double batch. Freeze the extras on a baking sheet, then wrap them in airtight wrapping and freeze.

Reheat frozen waffles in a toaster or toaster oven. Microwaving waffles and other bread products makes them rubbery.

, Individually packaged yogurt makes for a lot of packaging, and most of it has quite a bit of added sugar. Instead, add chopped, fresh fruit. Strawberries, bananas, oranges, apples, and many other fruits all complement yogurt nicely, with little or no added sugar.

If it's going in a lunch box, pack it in a reusable container and add chopped fruit directly.

, Compare the unit price of plain oatmeal to any boxed cereal and you'll quickly see how much more costly boxed cereals are. There's nothing special in them, either, but there is often a lot of added sugar and salt. (Read the nutrition facts, not the big print on the front of the box.) Boxed cereals also include a lot of extra packaging., If you love the pre-made instant oatmeal packets, take a moment to note the artificial flavors and glob of added sugar. Then, make your own. You can use old-fashioned, rolled oats (they cook just fine in boiling water or a microwave) or purchase plain instant oats. Then, add your own dried fruits (chop up the larger ones), slivered nuts, seeds, and any other flavors you want. Try a bit of cocoa powder! You can pack them directly in a reusable container, prepare them in that container, and eat out of that container., You can combine the dry ingredients for your favorite recipes. Remember to label them. Include what they are, what other ingredients need to be added, and any cooking instructions you'll need to get from the mix to the finished food., Hamburger Helper and similar products are generally a box of rice or pasta and a flavor packet containing a lot of salt and thickeners. In many cases, you could prepare an equivalent meal from scratch in the time it takes the rice or pasta to cook. Try beef stroganoff for one easy place to start. Or learn to make cheese sauce from real cheese in the microwave in less time than it takes to boil water and cook pasta and whatever else you'd like to eat with it., First cut the banana in half, then slice each half in half lengthwise twice until you end up with eight 2 to 4 inch (5.1 to 10.2 cm) spears. Place these in a dehydrator set to 135 or an oven set to 125 until the desired texture is reached. The more moisture you remove from the banana they longer they will last in storage. But they make a great chewy snack that lasts for days if you take them out just before they get crispy.

Hint: You can spend just a few minutes prepping this before you go do bed and they'll be ready for a quick, walking out the door breakfast by morning.

Collect your acorns.,
Shell the acorns.,
Grind the acorns.,
Rinse out the tannins.,
Dry out the mush.",How to Make Acorn Flour," Avoid anything that has a damaged shell, especially a dark hole or small circular scar on it about the diameter of a pencil lead. Those acorns have worms in them and are no good.;
, When dry, many will open themselves. If you wait for them to dry out, make sure that they get plenty of air, you don't want them to rot. If you have a dehydrator, you may consider speeding the process. Keeping them in the oven may work too if it has a pilot light.

, You can grind them in a food processor, or another option is to put them up in a blender with some water. Don't be stingy with the water, you'll be rinsing them out several times before your flour is ready. Think acorn smoothie.

, Acorns contain tannic acid which is bitter, and not good for your kidneys (or iron absorption). The good news is that it is water soluble and easy to remove.


If you made acorn mush, drape a cotton dishcloth over a deep bowl, pour in your mush and rinse it with warm water. Wring out the mush by bringing the corners of the towel together and twisting. Taste the mush, if bitter, repeat.
If you have ground acorns, flush them with water. The amount of time it'll take to rinse out the tannins depends on which kind of oak tree the acorns are coming from. See the Tips below.

Cold water. Place ground acorns in a large bowl of water. After the acorn meal settles out, decant the water. Repeat 2-3 times a day. If the acorns are from the black oak group, this can take 6-12 days. This method is best for maintaining the integrity of the kernel so that the resulting flour sticks together better (for making bread and other things).Running water. If you have an appropriate container, you can put the acorn meal in a stream and this will quicken the process.
Hot water. Bring the shelled, pounded kernels to a boil and change the water every 45 minutes or so for about 6 or 7 hours of boiling. This works best in a large pot on a wood stove. You will know when they are done, as they will taste very bland (no bitterness and no astringency). This method is faster and doesn't require the kernels to be ground into a coarse meal (small pieces are fine), but it alters the texture of the kernels and they don't stick together as well., Next spread the mush out on a cookie sheet and either leave it in the sun on a hot dry day, put it in your dehydrator, or put it in your oven after baking some cookies or something and let the residual heat do the job. Stir the mush occasionally to speed the process. If it clumps up and looks like ground beef, it is probably going well.

Determine how early to pull the beef out of the freezer.,
Place the ground beef in a plastic bag or dish.,
Refrigerate.,
Check the ground beef before you use it.,
Use within 1 or 2 days.",How to Defrost Ground Beef1," Typically, 2 lbs (900 g) of bulk ground beef takes a full 24 hours to thaw.









Significantly larger quantities of ground beef, like 3 or 4 lb (1350 or 1800 g) bulk packages, may take 48 hours or longer to defrost completely. As a general rule of thumb, add an extra day of defrosting time for every 2 lbs (900 g) of bulk ground beef.
Ground beef already formed into patties or separated into smaller quantities take less time and defrost quicker. For instance, 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) ground beef patties that were frozen separately usually take about 10 hours to defrost.
Keep in mind that the colder you keep your refrigerator, the longer the defrost time might be. Ground beef will thaw quicker in a refrigerator kept at 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) than it will in one kept at 35 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius).;
, It is possible that the beef may leak through its packaging as it starts to defrost, leaving behind an unsanitary breeding ground of bacteria. Placing the package of frozen ground beef in another container minimizes the amount of liquid and bacteria it will leave behind as it defrosts.









The bag does not need to be sealed, nor does the dish need to be covered. The purpose here is mainly to provide something for the package of ground beef to sit on inside the refrigerator.
This is especially important for ground beef packaged by a butcher. Factory packaging tends to be more regulated and more secure, so it may not leak as much. Packaging done to fresh meat sold in a grocery store or at a butcher tends to be slightly less durable and more likely to leak.

, Find a place toward the back of your refrigerator to place the package of ground beef and let it sit there until you need to use it.








, With clean hands, gently press down on the ground beef through its package. If you are able to leave an indentation in the center of the beef, most of it will be defrosted enough to use.









To check further, break the bulk of ground beef in half and press into the middle. If the meat is soft enough to press, it is thawed all the way through. If parts of the beef still seem solid, it is not completely defrosted.
If necessary, you can finish up the defrosting process in the microwave. Place the ground beef in a microwave-safe dish and cover it. Microwave on 50 percent power for 20 to 30 seconds at a time until it finishes thawing.

, Defrosting ground beef with the refrigerator is the slowest method, but it is also the most ideal since it breeds the least amount of bacteria. When defrosted this way, ground beef can be kept in the refrigerator for an additional 24 to 48 hours after thawing.









You can also refreeze the ground beef if thawed this way. If you decide not to use the ground beef after all, you can stick it back in the freezer as long as you do so within 24 to 48 hours of defrosting it.

Take an inventory of what you already have.,
Clear out old food.,
Look at how your foods are stocked on your shelves.,
Invest in small shelving units.,
Don't leave heat sensitive food in the pantry.,
Keep your pantry clean by wiping the shelves and products down every week or so.,
Place heavy products on the lower shelves.,
Avoid storing any foodstuffs on the floor.,
Invest in some sealed containers.,
Practice FIFO.,
Pin up a whiteboard or a magnetic shopping list you can reuse inside the pantry.,
Put back ingredients where you took them from as you use them.,
Look at how you cook and match it to how you shop.,
Every month, go into your pantry and do a check.",How to Keep a Pantry Organized," This inventory should include the product type as well as how many of each item you have. If you're really keen, type up a list and use it for future reference; using a laptop, notebook, or iPad as you work through the pantry can make it easier to type straight in.;
, Use this inventory opportunity to dispose of anything past its use-by or sell-by date. Also toss anything you don't ever intend to eat (for example, that exotic stuff you bought as it was a special price, but ended up wondering what to do with). With dated foods, while many may hypothetically be okay, it's still a risk. Dispose of anything that may be starting to spoil or is infested with moths or weevils. It can be quite surprising that food that otherwise looks fine has already spoiled, so check closely.


If the food is in good condition and within its lifespan, donate it or give it to someone who can use it.

, To reduce the messiness and difficulty in finding things, it's important to plan how to group the foods together. Quite often the most frequently used foods, such as tea or coffee, seasonings, sauces and frequently used tinned goods occupy the shelves in the middle range, as this is the easiest area to access.


It's usually best to group cereals, flour, pasta, rice and dried beans together.
Then it's practical to group all canned goods and all jar products together.
Or, you may find it better to group things by type, such as preserves in one group, but pasta sauce in another. Sort in the way that is most practical for you.

, These will enable you to double stack tinned goods, jars and other condiments, creating more space and making it far easier to see what's in the pantry with just a glance.


Sachet foods, such as spices, desserts, instant soups and other products can end up being a hassle in a pantry because they can slide behind other food and don't sit neatly. It's best to place all sachets together in one container (like a basket or a lunchbox with or without its lid, or if practical, store the sachet contents in a jar. This works well for spices and you can recycle the jars.
Consider removing sachets from bulky boxes and adding the sachets to smaller storage containers. If the box has cooking instructions, cut these off and tape them to the container lid for easy reference. This way surplus boxes can be gotten rid of to save space.
Use a pantry ""Lazy Susan"" to be able to turn items around. This item is great for spice and herb containers, cans, and condiments. Look for a double decker one to make the most of the space.

, Unless your pantry is naturally and consistently cold, don't store anything that is heat sensitive (such as eggs, chocolate, or butter) in there unless you have something such as a polystyrene box or other heat-proof container to store them in. The fridge is usually undesirable for some foods that only need a cool environment (especially chocolate), but in hot environments, it's the best alternative.

, As the doors of pantries seldom stop swinging, lots of dust and other debris can find their way in and settle on foods. Moreover, general movement of spices, herbs, grains, and packets of food tends to leave a trail of food residue on the shelves. This is bad if you store things such as bread on the shelf, where it is better to store them in a paper bag. It's also a vermin attractant, so be sure to clean it all up regularly.

, This makes them much easier to retrieve and less likely to cause injury if they fall.

, Foodstuffs situated on the floor space makes it much harder to clean the floor and vermin or pests can hide behind them or be attracted to the food more readily.

, Sealed containers are ideal to store foods that can perish when exposed to the environment; sealing them in will help to prevent spoilage. It can also prevent a weevil or other pest outbreak from spreading. Many foods, such as rice, sugar and flours already come sold in resealable screw top plastic canisters that can be cleaned and reused to store other foods. Charity stores also sell them cheaply secondhand, including the normally expensive products such as Tupperware®, but you don't always get matching containers.


Gradually build up your sealed containers whenever there are sale prices on them. This is the most affordable way to collect them provided you're patient. Also keep an eye out for people moving house who list such items on online auctions; you can grab an entire set of pantry containers for next to nothing if you're lucky – just be sure to wash them well.

, FIFO refers to: ""first in, first out"". This means that you use up the food stock in order that you purchased it. This prevents old foodstuffs sitting on the shelf for many years and ensures that what you're eating is at its freshest.



Supermarkets practice FIFO, especially in the dairy or refrigerated section. The oldest stock is usually right at the front of the shelf, with the fresher foods behind these. Shoppers who don't take care often reach for the nearest product and consequently take home foods that will not last as long. It's recommended to check the spoilage dates and buy the freshest one that has the longest lifespan; such smart shopping will prolong the life of your foodstuffs.

, That way when you are cooking and use the last of something, you can write it down to buy more while it is fresh in your memory.

, If necessary, label the place, but this can be a little over the top unless you're really absentminded. It is a lot easier to stay tidy if you get into this habit of returning ingredients straight after use and a well managed pantry is easy to return stock into because the space where the item should be hasn't been jammed with other things.


Educate other people in your household where things are, so that when they want to cook, it's easy for everyone to find what they need. Also encourage them to put everything back in its place; simply make this a rule of participating in a well-functioning kitchen.

, If you do a lot of baking, it makes sense to buy flour in larger portions to save costs and to take advantage of bulk-savings. The same applies for rice, pasta, beans and other pulses. The aim however, is to store them properly in screw top, or rubber seal containers (or any good sealed containers), so try to get the container before you get the large quantity purchases. Also buy or make scoops, cups, and other implements that will help you to transfer the ingredients from the storage containers to your kitchen workspace; it's not much fun lugging a very heavy flour container to where you need it!


Non perishable foods on special can be a good bargain, providing it is a genuine special, and not just because the foods are nearing their spoil dates. Pasta sauces are sometimes sold as a special for several jars and if it is something you will use in a reasonable time, it's fine to take advantage of these specials. On the other hand, if you know it's too much food, leave it for those who will use it rather than having food going off in your house.

, Anything that is in surplus, or has limited lifespan left you should plan to use within the week so it is not wasted. Throw out anything old and be sure to remove empty packets and containers.

Cut one red cabbage into thin strips.,





Divide the liquid between separate bowls.,





Create some color changes.,





Use the colored liquids to make colored sweet food.",How to Dye Food With Red Cabbage," Boil the red cabbage strips in water to cover. Once boiled, remove the cabbage and save the liquid. Pour it through a sieve or colander, catching the liquid in a bowl. Allow the purplish liquid to cool.
, This is so that you can make different colors. Add a little flour to the bowls. This will thicken the liquid slightly; you'll see that the liquid changes to a slight pastel pink shade, as shown in the image., Add one or more of the following ingredients to change the colors of each liquid (note that the color changes will tend to be pastel shades):

Add a little egg yolk: The color changes to yellow.
Add a drop of lemon juice: The color changes to red.
Add a pinch of baking soda: The color changes to green.
No flour or other items: The color stays bluish purple (the cabbage color)
Only flour: The color stays pale pink.

, In the example here, the colored liquids have been used to create a custard-like sweet dish. To sweeten a dish, obviously you'll need to add something more to the colored batter or liquid you've made, or the food will taste bland despite the lovely coloring. Suggestions for sweeteners include:

Melted chocolate
Jam, such as ""Takoyaki""






A good recommendation is adzuki bean paste.Sugar or syrup

,
Use the following as suitable crushing methods:

Crush fresh ingredients (for example, to make a pesto or paste), place the food into a sealed bag and crush with a rolling pin or meat mallet.,
For harder items like nuts, spices or garlic, crush them in a mortar and pestle.

,
For pureed foods, use a Moulinex food processor.,
Find a dough hook alternative.,
For pulsing soups or other similar products, use the following solutions:

To make between a smooth/chunky consistency, use a potato masher.,
For quick chopping where an even consistency is not always needed, use a mezzaluna type knife.,
For whipping, use a whisk.,
For grinding or mincing, use a mechanical mincer if there is one.",How to Cook Without a Food Processor," For shredded foods, most foods can be grated using a manual grater.


You can also use the grater for making fresh breadcrumbs.
Try to obtain a commercial grade food grater, as these are less likely to rust.;
, Take care using mandolins; always use the slicing handle they come with.

, Then slice again to make julienne like cuts on a smaller scale.

,,,






For crushing items such as biscuits or dry, stale bread for crumbs, use the same method, then sieve the crumbs through a colander or sieve to filter the fine crumbs, then crush the remaining coarse ones again.






An electric coffee mill can also be used to pulverize dry ingredients, such as herbs or grains. It should be cleaned thoroughly of coffee first, and and also after.







,, Alternatively, press the foods through a clean fine mesh or sieve to make food like pâté.

, For making a dough such as pasta, pastry or bread, use a stiff whisk, table knife or fork. These can be used to combine ingredients to keep your hands clean. You will still need to knead by hand, however, for quickest results.

,






For a very smooth soup, mash until no visible chunks remain, then pour through a sieve, and press the remainder through the sieve using a spoon.







, This will enable quick chopping. A standard knife and board will suffice for most vegetables and fruits.

, This is the easiest, but you could also use a bunch of thin bamboo kebab sticks to simulate a whisk.


For churning, such as butter or ice cream, use a rotary whisk if you have one.

, This will give a unique mincemeat like consistency which is very hard to replicate by hand.


If such an item is still not available, then slice thinly, finely chop and crush with a pestle, potato masher, or knead it by hand until you reach a mince consistency.

Bulk packages of ground beef weighing 1 lb (450 g) or less may thaw in less than an hour. A larger package will take longer, however. A 3-lb or 4-lb (1350-g or 1800-g) can take 2 to 3 hours., Place the package inside of a leak-proof plastic bag and seal it up as securely as possible.









If the bag leaks, bacteria could get in through the water or the air. Moreover, you could also end up with mushy, watery ground beef if the ground beef absorbs too much water.

, Place the wrapped package of ground beef in a large bowl or dish and cover it with cold tap water. Make sure that the beef is completely underwater.









Only use cold water. Hot, warm, or even room temperature water can create a breeding ground for bacteria.
Leave the dish of water and the beef out on the counter as it defrosts.
You could also fill a clean sink with cold water and submerge your beef in that. Just make sure that the plug has a tight seal and that the sink is clean before you start.

, Draining the old water and refilling the bowl with clean, cold water will allow the meat to continue defrosting while preventing the water from gathering too much bacteria.








, Once it is soft enough to press, the majority of the ground beef is thawed.









Break the block of ground beef open and press the middle of the inside. If it is still hard, the center of the beef is still frozen.

, In order to prevent bacteria from growing, you need to use ground beef thawed in this manner within 2 hours.









Do not refreeze ground beef thawed in cold water. It is not safe to refreeze raw ground beef defrosted in cold water. If you cannot use it within 2 hours of defrosting it, your best option is to cook it before refreezing it.

"
Place the beef in a microwave-safe glass dish.,
Microwave for about 3 minutes at 50 percent power per 1 pound (450 g).,
Determine whether or not the beef has defrosted enough.,
Use immediately.",How to Defrost Ground Beef3," Remove the beef from its packaging and place it flat inside a microwavable container. Cover the dish.









Since this is a very quick method, you can perform it immediately before starting dinner. You do not need to worry as much about starting the defrosting process in advance.
Prying the ground beef out of the package can be difficult if it is fully frozen and sitting on a Styrofoam tray. If you have difficulty removing the beef from its backing, place the beef inside a resealable plastic bag, zip it closed, and rinse the tray-side of the beef under cold running tap water until it loosens enough to remove.

, Use 50 percent power instead of 100 percent to help prevent the meat from beginning to cook.








Some microwaves have specific defrost settings. These settings automatically calculate how long to microwave the meat and at which power percentage. Select the defrost setting on your microwave, if you have one, and input the number of pounds being thawed.
Rotate, if necessary. Most microwaves have rotating turntables that continuously turn the contents of the microwave. If yours does not, however, you should pause the defrosting process every 2 minutes and manually rotate the ground beef 180 degrees.

, Press into the center of the mass to feel for spots that are still frozen solid.









If necessary, split the block in half and feel the inside middle for possible frozen spots.

, Defrosted ground beef that was thawed in the microwave must be used within 2 hours to be safe.









Do not attempt to refreeze raw ground beef that has been defrosted in the microwave. You can, however, cook the beef and refreeze it afterward.

Keep tea in the dark.,
Store your tea away from water.,
Keep tea and spices separate.,
Do not use plastic.,
Do not put tea in the refrigerator.",How to Store Loose Leaf Tea," Loose leaf tea keeps best in a stainless steel container as this easily blocks sunlight. Many loose leaf teas are actually sold in stainless steel containers, so if your tea came in one continue to store it in that.Make sure the container you choose is sealable. It's very important to seal loose leaf tea.;
, If you don't have a stainless steel container, a glass container can work as a substitute. However, make sure the glass container is colored. This will prevent your tea from being exposed to light. Do not use a clear glass container to store tea., If you bought your tea in a paper bag, and don't have any storage containers handy, it's okay to leave your tea in the bag. Tea can be kept in a paper bag if you intend to consume in the next couple of months. Just make sure to transfer the tea to a different container after a couple of months., After placing your tea in your chosen container, make sure you seal the container. Keep the lid on as tightly as possible. The less exposure your tea has to outside air, the better., Loose leaf tea should be kept in a room that's consistently room temperature. Fluctuations in temperature can damage loose leaf tea, so store it in a room where the temperature remains relatively stable. Avoid storing loose leaf tea near heaters, air conditioners, or windows., Loose leaf tea should not be exposed to much light, especially not direct sunlight. Store your tea somewhere that's not exposed to light. For example, you can store your tea in the back corner of a cabinet in your kitchen.If you do store your tea in a kitchen cabinet, make sure it's a cabinet that's away from heat sources like ovens and toasters.

, Humidity can adversely affect loose leaf tea. Keep your tea away from water that could cause humidity. Tea should be stored away from refrigerators, areas were you boil water, and any other places in your home near sources of water., Many people throw their loose leaf tea in with their spices. This is generally not a good idea. Tea can actually absorb aromas very easily. Storing your tea near spices can affect its taste., Never store your tea in plastic. Plastic absorbs odor and is generally clear, leaving your tea vulnerable to sources of light., Never store tea in your refrigerator. The refrigerator will not help tea keep longer and the moisture can damage your tea. Remember, loose leaf tea holds up best when it's stored at room temperature."

Smell the pineapple.,
Squeeze the pineapple.,
Determine whether or not the pineapple is heavy.,
Pluck a leaf from the top of the pineapple.",How to Tell if a Pineapple Is Ripe1," Flip the pineapple over and sniff the stem end. A sweet scent is generally considered the most important aspect of choosing a ripe pineapple. If it has no scent, it's probably not ripe.You can try smelling the pineapple from other sides; a sweet enough scent may be distinguishable from any side of the fruit. You should still be able to smell the scent from the stem end, however, where it will likely be strongest.
Avoid pineapples that smell fermented. Although you want the pineapple to smell sweet, you do not want it to be so ripe that the sweet smell has an alcoholic or vinegar-like taint to it.;
, Lightly squeeze the pineapple using the fingers of one hand. You want the pineapple to be pretty firm, but soft enough that it gives very slightly when you press down on it.

, A heavier pineapple means a juicier pineapple, because the extra juice gives the pineapple extra weight. More juice also means a riper, sweeter pineapple.


Note that ""heavier"" doesn't mean ""larger."" The pineapple should feel heavy when compared to others of equal size. If a larger pineapple feels just as heavy as a slightly smaller one, the smaller one is probably a better pick.

, While public opinion is conflicted over the efficacy of this method, some people believe that a pineapple is ripe when a leaf can be plucked from the top of the pineapple without too much resistance. If a leaf comes out too easily, however, the pineapple may be rotten.

Wrap bread in plastic or aluminum foil.,
Keep bread at room temperature for no more than two days.,
Freeze extra bread.,
Don't put bread in the refrigerator.,
Thaw frozen bread.",How to Store Bread," These types of wrappings will trap in the bread's natural moisture to keep it from drying out and getting hard. If your bread came in a paper wrapping, toss it out and wrap it in plastic or aluminum for storage.









If you have sliced, processed bread, you can seal it up in its original plastic packaging. Manufacturers of this style of bread recommend leaving it in this packaging to retain the moisture.
Some swear by leaving unsliced artisanal bread in the paper wrapper, or even leaving it unwrapped on the counter with cut side face-down. This does retain the crispiness of the bread's outer crust, but left exposed to the air, the bread will stale within a few hours.;
, Room temperature should be around 20ºC / 68ºF. Keep it away from direct sunlight in a cool and dry place, such as in your pantry or in a bread box.









If you have high humidity in your house, your bread may mold quickly at room temperature. If that's the case, you might want to skip straight to freezing it after you've eaten as much as you want while it's fresh.

, If you have more bread than you can consume before it goes stale within a few days, the best way to store it is by freezing. Freezing bread drops the temperature enough to stop the starch in the bread from recrystallizing and getting stale.









Be sure to store it in plastic freezer bags or heavy-duty foil, as lightweight household foil isn’t suitable for freezing.
Label and date it to prevent it from becoming a mystery cube.
Consider slicing your bread before freezing. That way you won't have to slice it while it's frozen, and it’s often difficult to slice post thawing.

, Scientific studies have shown that this draws out the moisture and the bread becomes stale three times faster than it would at room temperature. This happens from a process known as ""retrogradation"", which simply means that the starch molecules crystallize and the bread gets tough.








, If you have frozen your bread, allow it to thaw at room temperature. Remove the freezer wrapping and let it stand. If you'd like, crisp in the oven or toaster for a few minutes (no more than 5 minutes) to restore crustiness. Be aware that bread is only good for reheating once to return crustiness, after which you are simply reheating stale bread.

Pair pork chops with red cabbage.,
Make your own sauerkraut.",How to Select and Store Cabbage," Cabbage comes in either a green or red color. When picking out green cabbages, look for those that are shiny and bright, almost lime, green. Red cabbages should be a deep maroonish-purple color., If you feel a cabbage and it feels soft and spongy rather than firm and dense, your cabbage might be rotten on the inside. Only pick out cabbages that are firm or hard to the touch.

, When you are picking out a cabbage, look for cabbages that only have a few leaves hanging free from the rest of the head. If your whole cabbage looks like its come a little undone, and there are many leaves that are not tightly pressed to the stem (or center) of the cabbage, that cabbage might have a weird texture or flavor.


You should also look for leaves that are crisp rather than soft. Soft leaves means that the cabbage is a little old or has had damage done to it.

, If the leaves are heavily damaged or there are a lot of blemishes, or dark spots, on the cabbage, you should not buy it. These characteristics are generally associated with worm damage., Generally, larger heads of cabbage will have a milder flavor than smaller, more compact heads of cabbage. If you are new to eating cabbage, or are trying to get yourself to like it, pick larger heads that will hit you with less of that cabbage-y flavor.You should also keep in mind that a cabbage picked after a frost will be sweeter than one picked before a frost. If you are purchasing your cabbage from a farmers market, ask the person selling cabbage if their farm has had a frost yet.

, When you cut cabbage in half, it begins to lose its vitamin C.


If you absolutely must store half of a cabbage, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and store it in the refrigerator for up to two days., Keeping your cabbage cold will help it retain its nutrients and crisp texture. Place inside a plastic bag first. It should stay in prime condition for up to two weeks.If you have purchased Savoy cabbage, only store it in your refrigerator for one week. Use it after the week is up or else it will begin to go bad.

, This is especially important to do if any of the leaves have withered during storage or travel. Rinse the leaves and use as required. Enjoy!

Pick out larger carrots for sweetness.,
Look for carrots with deep coloring.,
Look for bright green leaves on carrot tops.,
Find carrots with a smooth shape.,
Avoid excessively cracked or split carrots.,
Choose carrots that feel firm to the touch.,
Cut off leafy tops.,
Refrigerate the carrots in an unsealed plastic bag.,
Store them in a cold area away from fruit.,
Scrub the carrots before using them.,
Peel older carrots.,
Eat the carrots within a couple of weeks.",How to Select Carrots," Larger carrots tend to signify longer growing times. The longer the carrot is in the the ground, the more sugar it can develop. These carrots will have woodier cores you may wish to remove before eating.


Fresher carrots are sweeter than older ones.
Most baby carrots are regular carrots cut down to size and aren’t sweeter.;
, Fresher carrots have more intense pigmentation. You’ll be drawn to hearty orange coloring, but carrots come in plenty of other colors too. Purple, red, yellow, and white carrots may also be present. They’re as safe to eat as orange carrots and will also look more colorful when they’re at their freshest.The coloring on a good carrot will be uniform from top to bottom.

, You can also judge the carrot’s freshness by the color of the leaves. Fresher carrots have brighter leaves. Wilted leaves are a sign that they carrot has been sitting on the shelf for a while.The leaves are more delicate than the rest of the carrot, so they’ll show age quicker. Selecting carrots with their tops still on is a great way to find the freshest carrots.

, Most carrots are long and slender, although others are shorter and rounder. You’ll know when a carrot looks misshapen because it’ll look twisted or covered in small roots. The carrot will often look a little pale when this happens, so it’ll show its age., Cracks and splits are easy to detect before you even pick up the carrot. Lots of cracks or even a split shows that the carrot is drying out and losing flavor. Unless you want a carrot that tastes old and woody, skip it.Many carrots develop some cracks from absorbing too much water while growing. These are still healthy to eat. Since everyone else may skip them, it can be better to choose them to avoid food waste.
A few ridges or cracks are fine. As long as the carrot isn’t excessively or deeply cracked, chances are it’ll be okay for you to pick. Look around for soft spots and other problems to make sure.

, Pick up the carrot and run your fingers along it. It should feel plump and firm. The healthiest carrots are crisp. Soft spots are a sign of decay. Avoid carrots that feel limp or rubbery.Carrots with a few soft spots haven’t gone bad yet. These carrots may still be eaten. Cut out the soft spots and use the carrots as soon as you can.

, Carrots lose moisture through the leaves. This will cause them to dry out and begin to crack. As soon as you can, remove the tops. These leaves can be wrapped in a damp paper towel and used within a day or two as a slightly bitter seasoning., The plastic bags you get from most stores when choosing produce work well for storage. Once any leaves are removed, you can place the carrots back inside the bag. The carrots give off moisture. In a sealed bag, the moisture collects and causes rot.Keeping the carrots dry can help them last longer. Try lining the bag with paper towels. Change out damp towels once or twice a week.

, Pick the coldest area in your refrigerator. This is usually at the bottom or inside a crisper. The carrots must be kept away from food that produces ethylene gas, such as bananas or pears. The gas ages the carrots., Most carrots don’t need to be peeled. Removing the outer layer can cause you to lose some nutrients. Instead, rinse the carrots off in water. Rub off any dirt with your fingers, a brush, or a sponge., Older carrots will have a more bitter skin than younger carrots. Peeling will usually make these carrots more enjoyable to eat. Younger carrots should also be peeled in recipes where tough, bitter skin may be overwhelming, such as when the recipe calls for steamed carrots., With proper storage, carrots tend to last about two weeks. Those kept dried may last for over a month. Bitter flavors will develop as the carrots age. After about two weeks you may also notice soft spots or rot. It’s best to use the carrots as soon as possible to avoid this.Carrots may also be blanched and frozen. These will last up to eight months, but the carrots lose some nutrients and flavor.

Be alert for the two key elements of a ripe pineapple: freshness and deterioration.,
Look at the pineapple's color.,
Focus on the color of the leaves.,
Check out the shape of the pineapple.,
Choose pineapples from the growing location closest to you.",How to Tell if a Pineapple Is Ripe2," You are looking for a fresh pineapple, not a rotting one. The stem is the area of the pineapple that feeds sugar to the fruit. It is from here that the pineapple changes color.

, It will often reflect a golden-yellow color, but a green-tinted pineapple is not necessarily unripe.Be aware that some pineapples are considered to be ripe when still partially green, but the pineapple should not be all green or all brown. You should also place more emphasis on the pineapple's healthy appearance.
As a general rule, the yellow coloration should be visible on the eyes at the base of the fruit. Color that rises further up the pineapple usually indicates a sweeter fruit., Because the color of the fruit itself can be either golden-yellow or green, looking at the leaf color might be a better option. Choose pineapples with healthy, green leaves.

, Pineapples should be well developed with rounded edges and developed eyes. The eyes are the spiked centers of the rough circles created by the geometric pattern on the pineapple. Make sure that the eyes have filled out and are relatively flat.Avoid pineapples with wrinkled skin, reddish-brown skin, cracks or leaks, mold, or brown withering leaves, as these are all signs of a rotten fruit.

, For instance, if you live in California, Hawaiian or Mexican pineapples will probably be the freshest because they traveled the shortest distance from the plantation to your supermarket.

Eat a whole pineapple stored at room temperature within a few days.,
Refrigerate your pineapple to keep it fresh longer.,
Cut the pineapple up and refrigerate it for up to one week.,
Freeze freshly cut pineapple for up to six months.",How to Tell if a Pineapple Is Ripe3," As long as you do not cut the pineapple, it should stay fresh for several days. Do not leave cut pineapple out in a room temperature setting, however, since it will spoil after a few hours.

, A whole refrigerated pineapple, when left uncut, can last about two weeks. Once you cut the pineapple or remove its skin, it will only last for about one week in your refrigerator.

, To properly cut your pineapple, cut off the crown and the base of the fruit. Place the pineapple upright on a cutting board and carefully slice on the inside of the rind from top to bottom. Make sure to cut deep enough to remove all of the prickly rind.The pineapple will still have its ""eyes"" at this point. You can cut them away individually, but it might be easier to cut along the sides of the pineapple in a diagonal, v-shaped trench since the eyes should be patterned along the sides in a diagonal.Cut the pineapple in half lengthwise and then in half again so that you have four triangle-shaped quarters.






Cut the tough core out of the center and discard, then slice the four pieces into chunks or slices.







, Slice the pineapples in large chunks to retain as much flavor as possible, as freezing can cause pineapples to lose flavor. Place the pineapple chunks in freezer-safe plastic containers or freezer-safe plastic bags before storing.When you're ready to use the pineapple, simply remove it from the freezer and let it thaw in your refrigerator or at room temperature before use.

Select a heavy pomegranate.,
Choose a pomegranate with a deep colored rind.,
Examine the shape.,
Test the fruit for any soft areas.,
Select pomegranates with smooth, unbroken surfaces.,
Dress appropriately.,
Cut your pomegranate into quarters.The rind of pomegranates are hard, and you can’t really peel a pomegranate because the seeds are nested into and attached to the internal membrane.,
Fill a bowl with water.,
Place your quartered pomegranate in the water-filled bowl.Removing the seeds of the pomegranate in water is the easiest way to de-seed your fruit because the seeds are heavier than the membrane that surrounds the seeds.,
Separate the seeds from the flesh.,
Refrigerate.,
Store your pomegranate in a dry, cool place.,
Refrigerate the seeds.,
Freeze the seeds.If you don’t plan on eating your seeds within a few days, you can prolong the freshness by storing them in the freezer.",How to Select and Store Pomegranates," While at the grocery store or farmers market, choose the heaviest pomegranates to purchase.The weight of the pomegranate signifies how juicy it is. Lighter pomegranates do not contain as much juice as heavier ones.


Although you could weigh each pomegranate on a produce scale, you don’t necessarily need to do so. Just grab one in each hand and continue comparing until you have found the heaviest ones.;
, The rinds vary in shades of red, from bright to more brownishor even pink.The rind should also be glossy.While the shade of the rind doesn’t signify anything about ripeness or flavor, the deeper the color, the better., Unripe pomegranates are round, like apples. However, their shape changes slightly as the fruit ripens and the juice-filled seeds begin to expand outward and press against the insides of the pomegranates. A ripe pomegranate will have more of a square shape because the sides will be flattened (instead of rounded)., To be sure your pomegranates aren’t bruised, hold each pomegranate and gently squeeze it. The pomegranates should be hard, with no mushy spots., The rind should be soft enough to scratch. If so, you know you have a ripe pomegranate. Unripe pomegranates have very hard rinds that cannot be scratched.However, in very ripe pomegranates, the rind will be splitting open because the seeds are filled with juice and are expanding, which puts pressure on the outside of the pomegranate, causing the rind to split. You’re more likely to find pomegranates like this at the end of Autumn, when they are ripest, and at your local farmers market (rather than the supermarket)., Before de-seeding your pomegranate, you may want to grab an apron or change into an old shirt that you don’t mind getting stained. The juice from pomegranates will stain your clothes, so you might not want to wear your favorite outfit while removing the seeds!, To get to the edible part of the pomegranate, you’ll need to cut into and through the rind. Cutting the pomegranate into quarters rather than halves will give you better access to the seeds.

, Select a bowl in which you can submerge your pomegranate quarters. A medium size mixing bowl should be deep enough. Leave enough space in the bowl to place your hands into it without causing the water to overflow., Thus, the seeds will sink to the bottom of the bowl, and the membrane will rise to the surface.Alternately, you can remove the seeds over the bowl and let the flesh and seeds drop into the bowl (rather than submerging the pomegranate in the water).This way, you can immediately dispose of the rind when you have removed all the seeds.
Removing the seeds underwater, however, lessens the risk that you may drop part of the pomegranate onto your counter top and stain it., While submerged in the water, hold the pomegranate quarter with one hand, and run the thumb of your other hand around the clumps of seeds.


Once you have removed all the seeds, you can skim off the membrane from the top of the water with your hands or a small strainer. Remove the seeds from the bottom of the bowl in the same manner.Enjoy eating the plump seeds or prepare for storage!

, Refrigerating your pomegranate rather than leaving it on your counter or in your fruit basket will help keep it fresher longer.You can expect your pomegranate to last for about two months if you keep it refrigerated., It will last for about a month this wayand for a week at room temperature., After removing the seeds from your pomegranate, you can store them in the refrigerator for five days. Be sure, however, to seal them tightly in a container or plastic bag before storing them.,


Be sure the seeds are completely dry before freezing them.Otherwise, they will clump together.
You can also flash freeze the seeds before freezing them in a storage bag. After drying any remaining water off the seeds, place them in a single layer on a wax-paper lined baking sheet. Freeze them on the baking sheet for two hours before storing them in a freezer bag.Pomegranate seeds can be stored in the freezer for about a yearand are best if used within a year.

Examine the color and texture of the apricots’ skin.,
Consider the size of the apricots.,
Touch the fruit to test for firmness.,
Place unripened apricots in a paper bag.,
Set the bag out at room temperature.,
Test the smell and feel of the fruit after a couple of days.,
Put the apricots in a plastic bag or container.,
Refrigerate the apricots.,
Eat the fruit within a few days.",How to Select and Store Apricots," Apricots are in season locally for a short period of time. You’ll have better luck finding good fruit if you shop at the peak of their season. In the Northern Hemisphere, they are in season mid-May through mid-August. In the Southern Hemisphere, they are in season November through January.You can often find apricots from the other hemisphere in your region during its respective season. However, it’s best to only purchase them when they’re ripe locally because imported apricots are likely to be over or under ripe.;
, Ripe apricots are orange-gold in color with some hints of redness. Their skin should be smooth and unwrinkled, so pass on apricots that have cuts or dents. Avoid any apricots that are pale yellow or greenish-yellow.Stay away from apricots with shriveled skin, which are usually overripe.

, Apricots come in a variety of sizes that range from 1 ⅜ -inch (3.5 cm) to 2 ⅜ -inch (6 cm). On average, ripe apricots are usually the size of a golf ball so it's usually best to keep an eye out for fruit that size and larger.If the apricots are the right color and firmness to indicate ripeness, you don't need to avoid smaller apricots. They're often the tastiest because they haven't been forced to grow larger with overwatering.

, Ripe apricots should feel firm to the touch. However, they should yield slightly to light pressure. If the apricots feel extremely hard, they haven’t ripened yet. You can purchase them and allow them to ripen at home, though.While a hard apricot will continue to ripen, don’t purchase an apricot that feels hard and is tinged with green. It will likely never develop its full flavor.An apricot that feels extremely soft or mushy is overripe it, so you shouldn’t buy it.

, If you’ve purchased unripened apricots that still feel hard, put them in a brown paper bag. Carefully fold down the top of the bag to close it so the ethylene gas that the apricots produces will be trapped and help it ripen.You don’t necessarily have to use a brown paper bag, but you may already have some in your kitchen for packing lunches. Otherwise, you can use a white paper bag.
Don’t store the apricots in a plastic bag. Unlike paper, which is slightly porous so some air can pass in and out of the bag, plastic is airtight. As a result, the ethylene gas may be too effective and you may wind up with mushy, overripe apricots.

, While the apricots are ripening, don’t refrigerate them. Instead, leave the bag with the fruit out at room temperature on your counter or table. Allow the apricots to ripen for two to three days.Make sure to place the bag in a location that’s not near direct sunlight or heat.

, After two days, open the paper bag to check on the apricots. Smell the fruit to see if it they have a sweet scent, which usually indicates that they're ripe. Touch the apricots too -- it should give slightly when you press your finger against it lightly., If you bring apricots home from the store that are already ripe, leaving them exposed to the air can cause them to spoil more quickly. Place the fruit in a sealable plastic bag or container so they’re protected., To preserve the fruit for as long as possible, put the bag or container with the apricots in the refrigerator. The cold will keep them from spoiling too quickly, though you should be aware that lower temperatures can sometimes alter the taste and texture of apricots.Make sure the apricots are ripe before putting it in the refrigerator. Unripened apricots won’t ripen if you refrigerate them.

, While refrigerating the apricots can prolong their life, you shouldn’t wait too long to eat or use the fruit. For the best tasting apricots, eat or use them within two to three days.Apricots will usually stay good in the refrigerator for up to a week. However, their taste and texture may be compromised.

Place the plums in a clean paper bag.,
Store the bag at room temperature.,
Test the plums for ripeness.,
Enjoy the ripe plums.",How to Ripen a Plum," Any paper bag will do, but it should be empty of all contents except plums. When plums (and other fruit) ripen, they emit ethylene. Placing them in a paper bag with the top folded over keeps the gas close to the plums, speeding up the ripening process.An even quicker method is to put a ripe banana in the bag with the plums. The extra ethylene produced by the banana will cause the plums to ripen fast. Don't place the plums in a plastic bag. Using a nonporous bag will prevent fresh air from entering, and the plums will end up having a funny taste.
If you prefer, you can ripen the plums by placing them in a fruit bowl, rather in a bag. The plums will still ripen, they just won't be ready quite as quickly.;
, The plums will ripen best when kept at a temperature between 68 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit.Keep them at this temperature until they become fully ripe.


Don't store the bag in a sunny window, as it's likely to cause the plums to overheat. If the plums get too hot they will begin to rot.
Likewise, storing the plums in the refrigerator or at a cold temperature before they are ripe will bring about what is called chill damage. A chill-damaged plum will never become juicy and sweet; instead, you'll end up with a mealy, tasteless plum., The easiest way to tell when your plums are ripe is to lightly press the skin with your finger. If you make a slight indentation, the plum is probably ripe. If it's still hard to the touch, you'll need to wait a bit longer. If your finger punctures the plum's skin at the merest touch, the process has gone a bit too far. Here are a few other ways to test for ripeness:


Observe the texture of the skin. Plums begin taking on a dusty appearance as they ripen.
Touch a plum near the tip. When it's ready, that area will be a bit softer than the rest of the plum., You can eat or cook the plums as soon as they're ripe. To halt the ripening process and preserve them for a bit longer, store them in your refrigerator's crisper.

, Try comparing the weight of your watermelon with another of equal size - the heavier one will be the riper. This advice goes for most fruits and vegetables.

, The underside of the watermelon should have a creamy yellow spot, known as the field spot. This is where the melon sat on the ground and ripened in the sun, so the darker it is the better! This one is no wives' tale. If the field spot is white, or even nonexistent, this probably means that the watermelon was picked too soon, and will not be ripe., A perfect, ripe watermelon should be dark green in color and dull in appearance, rather than shiny. A shiny watermelon will usually be under ripe.

, The knocking technique can be a little hard to master, but many watermelon fans swear by it. Give the watermelon a firm rap with your knuckles and listen to the sound it makes. For a ripe melon, you want a full sound, more tenor than base. You do not want a dull or deep sound, as this means the watermelon is unripe., If you're purchasing pre-cut watermelon, there are also certain things to look out for. Choose pieces with bright red flesh and dark brown or black seeds. Avoid pieces with white streaks and an abundance of white seeds. You should also steer clear if the flesh looks dried out or mealy, or is separating from the seeds., A whole, uncut watermelon can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week, before it needs to be used. Remember to handle the watermelon carefully to avoid bruising.


Never store a watermelon below 40 °F (4 °C), as this causes chilling injury to the the fruit.
If you wish to ripen your watermelon after purchase, keep it at room temperature for a couple of days. This will ripen the watermelon slightly, but not a huge amount - this is due to the fact that when a watermelon is picked too soon it will never fully ripen.

, To cut your watermelon into bite-size chunks, first place the watermelon on a chopping board and cut off the top and bottom using a sharp knife. This will allow you to securely stand the watermelon on one of the cut edges.


Run the blade of the knife down the sides of the watermelon, cutting the rind from the flesh. Next cut the watermelon into round disks, then cut the disks into 1-inch cubes.






If not using immediately, place the cut watermelon in a covered container and refrigerate. It will keep like this for 3 to 4 days., If you would like to deseed a watermelon, simply cut the watermelon in half, then in quarters. Cut through the flesh of the melon along the seed line with a paring knife.


Now, lift off the piece you just cut out. Using a fork, scrape the seeds from the piece you just removed and from the remaining flesh on the rind.






This is perfect to dice up into chunks for a snack, use in salsa, mix into drinks or anything else you would use watermelon for.

, Watermelon is the perfect addition to a fresh salad, giving your lunch an added, juicy crunch. This recipe pairs watermelon with cucumbers, cashew nuts and feta cheese!

, Can you imagine anything more refreshing than a cold glass of watermelon-flavored lemonade on a hot summer's day? Use the sweetest watermelon you can find for best results!

, Watermelon donuts aren't really donuts, they're just watermelon slices cut into the shape of donuts. Topped with sugar and slivered almonds, they make a delicious snack.

, This tasty, but not-so-healthy treat is often served at county fairs and other events. Finished with some powdered sugar, it makes a decadently juicy treat!

, You can make a delicious, summery drink by infusing vodka with watermelon slices - serve over ice with a little juice for a perfect pink party drink!

Set aside some space in or near your kitchen to store food.,
Buy items as you need and use them.,
Start with the basics.,
Include other sources of starch.,
Have dry storage for things like onions and potatoes.,
Include some canned goods.,
Include some breads.,
Decide whether you'll do any baking.,
Use your freezer as part of your pantry.,
Start to build a selection of seasonings, according to what you use.,
Supplement your pantry with regular trips to the store to get perishable foods, such as eggs, dairy, and fresh fruits and veggies.,
Learn which ingredients last longer than others.,
Use up and replace the items in your pantry.,
Keep the ingredients around for one or two pantry meals that you can do if you haven't had the time to go shopping.",How to Outfit Your College Pantry," If your kitchen does not have any obvious pantry space built in or is short on overall storage, see if a bookcase nearby (perhaps in a coat closet) or other movable storage could work.


Try to find a space that is clean, dry, cool, and dark for your pantry. The cabinet just over your stove may not be the best choice.;
, This means that you will acquire the items in your pantry gradually (thus avoiding any major, up-front expenses) and it also means that you will buy only those things you are prepared to use.


Consider bringing some things from home to get you off to a ""free"" and easier start. Get your parents' permission first, though.

, Spaghetti sauce in jars and boxed pasta are easy staples to start with. Even when you move on to slightly more sophisticated meals, they'll be handy things to keep around for that day when things get especially busy.

, Rice, flour, oatmeal, and potatoes are all starches that will keep for a good long while in the pantry. While you most likely will not eat these foods alone, they are all good for extending other meals.


Store flour, rice, oatmeal, and the like in airtight (and bug-tight) canisters or jars. If you don't have dedicated canisters yet, you can save large jars from items you buy.

, There's generally no need to refrigerate either, so long as the space is relatively cool and dry and has good air circulation. A basket or bin with holes in it will help.


Potatoes should be stored away from a light source, to discourage sprouting.

, It's generally healthier and far cheaper to use fresh vegetables and make your own soups, but having a few cans on hand for the busy moments doesn't hurt. You can also stock cans of things like tomato sauce, beans, and mushrooms, if you like to use those in cooking.

, You can buy regular bread, or you can buy food like pitas or tortillas. Some tortilla chips can also go well with food like tacos and chili.

, If you intend to bake, you will need baking staples like flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt.

, Frozen meats are very convenient, especially if you have a microwave in which to defrost them. (Otherwise, defrost in the fridge a day in advance.) Frozen vegetables may not be quite as good as fresh ones, but you may find that they are easier to keep on hand than fresh.


If you love smoothies, you might consider getting frozen fruit, too, or freezing your own fruit. You can also learn how to freeze cooked foods and ready-to-cook foods for yourself, for quick meals later.

, These are herbs and spices, as well as the ubiquitous salt and pepper, and include condiments like soy sauce, ketchup, and vinegar.


Seasonings add flavors to your cooking. Some can be fairly expensive, so start with one jar of spices at a time.
You don't need every spice; just the ones you use. Find out what your recipes call for and just buy that.
Look for a few seasoning mixes, or mix your own. Italian seasoning is generally just a mix of oregano, basil, rosemary and parsley. A jar of chili powder or taco seasoning can dress up some basic meat and veggies so they'll taste good in a tortilla. Do watch for added salt in seasoning mixes, though.
Some grocery and health food stores may provide samples of spice mixes for free. This is a good opportunity to get a sample package or two spice mixes.
Look around for a source of spices in bulk or in packets, rather than in little, glass jars. You may want to buy spices the first time in those glass jars, but refill them with spices in less expensive packaging.

, If you plan a bit, you may be able to keep these trips to about once per week.

, All foods will eventually spoil, but some things will last longer than others. Buy your quantities according to how quickly you use each item.

, As you use something up, or get close, put it on your shopping list, as long as it is something you use regularly. Keep a shopping list pad near the pantry with a pencil, so that's it's really easy to update missing ingredients.

, Spaghetti and tacos are two fairly easy choices.

Find something to hold your berries.,
Search for a good bush.,
Start looking for good blueberries.,
Find a good berry, and then pick it.,
Continue picking until you have gotten most of the good berries off the bush.

,
Move on to the next bush, and keep picking until you have all the blueberries you want.

,
Remember to carefully wash all blueberries before consuming.

,
Finished.

",How to Pick Blueberries," It can be a bucket, a plastic bag, a basket, or some other kind of container. Just make sure the blueberries won't fall out of it.


If you carry your berries in a bucket, you may want to add a rope on the bucket so that you can hang it around your neck or over your shoulder. An excellent bucket can easily be made by taking a 1 gallon (3.8 L) plastic milk jug and cutting off 1/2 of the top and sides, making sure you leave the handle part on. You can then put the handle through your belt, and you now have two hands to pick with! Kids - have your parents cut the milk jug for you.
Use a bucket to carry your berries ,and you may want to put a plastic bag in it. You can secure the bag with a rubber band. This comes in handy if you fill more than one bucket -- instead of needing a new bucket every time, all you need is a new bag.

You can also make a berry-picking bucket out of a piece of string and a 1-quart plastic container (such as an empty yogurt or cottage cheese container). Use a pair of scissors to punch two holes opposite each other near the top of the container. Take a piece of string long enough to fit behind your neck and down to your mid-torso, put an end of the string through each of the holes. Tie or knot the string to secure it. Put the string around your neck with the ""bucket"" hanging in front, and you'll now be able to pick with both hands!;
, If you are picking at a public berry farm, the best bushes are probably towards the back, because the ones in the front have already been picked out by others. A good bush will have many good berries.

, A good berry is round, blue, and the skin should not be cracked. The general rule when it comes to blueberries is ""the bigger, the sweeter"". Pick them ""as is"" because they won't sweeten any further after picking.Do not pick berries that are:
• White -- these berries have not even begun to ripen yet
• Small and hard -- chances are, these berries will be very sour... if you can even chew them at all!

, To pick a blueberry, simply attempt to roll it off the stem. Then, either put the blueberry in the bucket or eat it. If it doesn't come off with a very light touch, it's probably not ripe yet. Even if the color is right, it's best to just move on.


If you find yourself tempted to eat every blueberry you see, try ""one for me, two for the bucket"".
If you find a ""clump"" of good berries on one stem, you can try cupping your hand around them, and rubbing them gently to loosen them, and make them fall off. This is a good way to pick more than one at a time, because most of the bad berries will stay on the stem, since they don't come off as easily.

Look for signs of old strawberries before buying.,
Throw away moldy strawberries immediately.,
Don't wash strawberries until just before you use them.,
Understand how a vinegar wash works.,
Store in the refrigerator or a cold area.",How to Keep Strawberries Fresh1," Stains or mush on the container might be signs of rotting fruit, or at least wet fruit that is more susceptible to spoiling. Dark-colored or mushy strawberries are probably beginning to spoil, while strawberries with any signs of fuzzy mold are no longer usable.


If you're picking your own strawberries, pick them after they have ripened and become bright red, while they are still firm.





;
, Mold can spread from one strawberry to another, quickly ruining the whole batch. While ideally you can find a batch of firm, bright red, mold-free strawberries in the store, one or two bad ones are often hiding among the good. Check the strawberries right after you buy them and toss out any that are fuzzy, or dark-colored and mushy strawberries that might get moldy soon.


This applies to moldy fruit stored near the strawberries as well.

, Strawberries will begin to soak up water and break down into soggy mush if left wet too long, which speeds up the spoiling process.Delay this by only washing your strawberries right before you eat them or use them in a recipe.


If you have already washed a batch of strawberries, pat dry with a paper towel.
Washing strawberries before eating is still a good idea to remove potentially harmful chemicals or soil organisms.

, A mixture of white vinegar and water can remove potentially harmful bacteria and viruses from fruit more effectively than water alone, but this does not necessarily mean the strawberries will last longer.Fruit will break down even if the organisms that feed on it are killed, and too much liquid may actually break it down faster. If many of the strawberries in the batch had to be thrown out due to mold, it may be worth it to apply one part white vinegar and three parts water with a spray bottle. Otherwise, use vinegar washes only when washing the fruit, directly before using.


Rubbing the fruit with your fingers while washing will dislodge dirt and micro-organisms, and is more effective than only holding the fruit in running water.







, Strawberries will stay fresh in a cold environment, ideally within the range of 32–36ºF (0–2ºC). In order to prevent shriveling, keep them in the crisper drawer of your refrigerator, or in a plastic clamshell or partially open plastic bag.If your strawberries are wet on their surface, first pat dry with paper towels and place them between new, dry paper towels to absorb moisture.

Clear out everything in your fridge.,
Categorize your fridge items.,
Label your shelves.,
Put the food back in an orderly fashion.,
Use Post-its or other sticky notes to date the leftovers.,
Done.",How to Make It Easier to Find Things in Your Fridge," Throw away anything that is expired, spoiled, or otherwise inedible. While you're at it, you might want to clean your fridge. This is time to start anew!






;
, Keep this simple, so that it is easy to remember and use. Depending on your household, you may have different categories, but these basic classifications can help you sort your items:









Fruit (needs less humidity than vegetables and some fruit cannot be refrigerated successfully, such as bananas)
Veggies (often kept in the vegetable crisper drawers as they require the humidity to keep them in good condition but not mushrooms, as they turn slimy)
Meat, poultry and fish (always keep in a separate compartment or on the base shelf, so that blood or juices do not drip onto other food, risking contamination)
Eggs and dairy
Leftovers and prepared food. This might also include opened jars of jam/jelly, pickles, preserves, etc.

, Write out labels on note cards and stick them to the shelves, or write on masking tape and affix the tape to the shelf edges. This will help to remind you where to keep each food type, as well as making it easier for others to put food back in the right spots.









There are scientifically proven areas to store foods in a fridge for optimal cooling effect.The exact optimal positioning for foods depends on the make of your fridge, but in general, the door is warmest (and hot air hits those items every time the door is opened), so more resilient food should go there, such as condiments. The shelves nearer the freezer are usually the coldest, while the crisper tends to create a warmer barrier that causes the shelf above it to be warmer. Meat and fish is often best mid-level to avoid freezing or warmth but this will depend on space availability and likelihood of dripping. How far you want to take this approach is up to you; often experience will tell you best!
As well as labels, consider adding a few permanent containers for certain items like syrup, opened pasta sauce containers and preserves. Having permanent containers for such items makes it easy to pull them out and to locate them. Customized long containers are available for fridges from specialist stockists. Label these too.

, Follow the categorization you've come up with and the shelving placement. If you find anything doesn't fit the way you wanted it to, make adjustments until you're satisfied that it's going to work well.








, You may also want to use this method for other foods.









Leftover food should always be covered to retain freshness and prevent cross-contamination with odors or bacteria, etc.

, Try to keep to the categories and encourage other householders to do so too. Have regular clean-outs of old or over-dated food so that you don't miss the fresher additions––weekly quick cleans are recommended over monthly longer cleans.

Freeze ripe, firm strawberries.,
Cut off the inedible green material.,
Decide how to prepare your strawberries before freezing.,
Add sugar or sugar syrup (optional).,
Consider pectin syrup instead (optional).,
Place the strawberries in freezer-safe containers.,
Partially thaw strawberries before using.",How to Keep Strawberries Fresh2," Once a strawberry has started to decay or turn mushy, freezing won't save it. The ripe, bright red strawberries will preserve best.Moldy or mushy strawberries should be discarded in the compost, garden, or trash.

, Most strawberries are sold with a green cap where the stem was attached, or with a small stem segment. Cut these off before freezing.

, You can freeze strawberries whole, but if you intend to use them in recipes or as toppings you may wish to chop, slice, crush, or puree them first. Once frozen and thawed, they will be more difficult to cut, although pureeing always remains an option. Larger strawberries may also freeze and thaw more evenly if you cut them into smaller pieces first.If you're not sure how you want to prepare your strawberries, look at a few recipes first. Pureed strawberries work well in slushies or smoothies, while sliced ones go well as toppings on cakes or waffles. Whole strawberries can be dipped in chocolate.







, Packing strawberries in sugar or sugar syrup will preserve more flavor and texture, but not everyone enjoys the extreme sweetness that can result.If you do decide to go this route, use 3/4 cup (180 mL) sugar for each 1 quart (1 L) berries, regardless of how they are prepared. Alternatively, create a heavy sugar syrup by mixing equal parts sugar and lukewarm water, then chill in the refrigerator and use it to cover the berries completely.While it may make more sense to add sugar or syrup after packing the strawberries, decide whether to use it or not before you begin packing, so you know whether to leave additional space in the containers.

, This is a good option if you prefer an unsweetened strawberry, but you want to preserve the flavor and texture better than a ""dry pack"" with no additional ingredients would. This requires purchasing powdered pectin, and boiling it in water. Different brands may require different amounts of water per packet. Let the pectin syrup cool before covering the strawberries.


Note that this may not preserve it as well as the sugar or sugar syrup.







, Thick, rigid glass and plastic containers typically work best, but make sure they are freezer-safe before using. Freezer-safe plastic zip lock bags are another option. Pack the strawberries loosely to prevent them forming one large mass. It's generally a good idea to leave 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25–2 cm) of space at the top of the container to allow for expansion while freezing.


If the strawberries are packed ""dry,"" without any sugar or syrups, you may wish to spread them loosely on a tray and freeze them for a few hours on the tray. Then transfer to a more compact container as described. This makes it easier to remove individual strawberries instead of a large, icy lump.

, Remove the strawberries and let thaw in the refrigerator for several hours before using. If you wish to speed up this process, put the strawberries under cold running water. Heating in a microwave or by another method may cause the strawberries to become unpleasantly mushy. Eat while there are still a few ice crystals on the surface, as the strawberries may become mushy when fully thawed.

The exact length of time this process takes depends on the temperature and the size of your strawberries. A large mass of strawberries frozen together may need to be left overnight or even longer.

, Boil a large stockpot of water on the stove over high heat. After the water reaches a rolling boil, carefully lower the jars inside the pot using jar tongs. Do not let the jars bump into each other, as this could lead to chips or cracks forming. Allow the jars to sterilize in the hot water for 10 to 15 minutes before carefully removing them with jar tongs.

, The lids also need to be sterilized before use, but some canning lids should not be boiled in water prior to the canning process. To be on the safe side, heat water in a small pot to a boil, reducing the heat before it reaches a rolling boil so that it just barely sits at a simmer. Use jar tongs to place the lids into the hot water and remove the lids with your tongs after 5 minutes pass.

, The jars and lids should still be warm when canning the peppers. As a result, instead of allowing them to air dry, dry the supplies quicker by using a clean, dry dish towel or paper towels.

Calculate the canning time.",How to Can Peaches5,"


If you do not have a canner, you can make your own. Find a pot or saucepan that is large enough to hold the jars. There should also be room for an inch of water above the jars. Place a washcloth or towel at the bottom of the pot before you put the jars in. This will keep the jars from directly touching the metal of the pot.

, Canning time varies according to the type of canner you have and the altitude of your location. Be sure to check your canner's instructions.









If you are using a boiling water canner, these guidelines should help. For 0–1,000 feet (0.0–304.8 m) above sea level, cook for 10 minutes. For 1,001–3,000 feet (305.1–914.4 m), cook for 15 minutes. For 3,001–6,000 feet (914.7–1,828.8 m), cook for 20 minutes. If you are above 6,000 feet (1,828.8 m), cook for 25 minutes.
If you are using a dial gauge pressure canner or a weighted gauge pressure canner, you will need about 8 minutes. Clarify with the instruction manual of your canner."

Screw a clean ring down over the seal and tighten it with snug hand pressure.,
Use a water bath canner if your canning recipe calls for it.,
If you use a large stock pot, place a rack or other spacer (such as a small towel) on the bottom of the pot so that the jars do not rest directly on the bottom of the pot.,
Use a pressure canner if your recipe calls for it.,
Remove the jars from the canner.,
Allow the full jars to cool for 24 hours in a place free from drafts.,
Check to make sure that the jars have sealed after several hours have passed.,
Wash the jars in room-temperature, soapy water to remove any residue on the outsides.,
Label your canned goods with the year, at least.",How to Can Food," It’s best to can food that you like. There's no point in canning gallons of something you don't like or your family won't eat, unless you plan on giving your canned goods as gifts or selling them.


If you grow your own fruits and vegetables, choose a food you have a lot of. If your peach tree has been particularly fruitful this year, can your peaches rather than the two strawberries your plant produced this season. Canning is a great way to preserve those extra tomatoes or apples at their peak.;
, Some foods require more handling, time, and processing than others.


If you're just beginning to can, start with one batch of tomatoes or jam, not 40 pounds of apples. You can always do more as you grow comfortable with the process and decide you like it. Remember that while cherries can be canned, you'll have to take out every pit first.

, Fruits and vegetables should be firm and ripe, free of bad spots and mold. Foods need not be beautiful to can them. If you are growing or buying tomatoes, you may find yourself with ""process tomatoes"" (tomatoes with more bulges and seams than might sell well in the supermarket) or pickling cucumbers.

, Different foods require different processing. It's perfectly alright to use a favorite old family recipe, but compare it to a similar recipe in a modern guide and adjust the processing time and technique accordingly. The basics for safety may have changed since an old recipe was written.


Consult the latest USDA guidelines or Ball or Kerr books for process times according to jar contents and size, especially if you use an old recipe. Processing times have changed over the years because we have learned more about food safety and, in some cases, because foods are being bred differently. Tomatoes, for example, may be considerably less acidic than they used to be.

, You want to reduce the amount of bacteria that could contaminate your canned food as much as possible. Wash them again before resuming work if you sneeze, visit the bathroom, or handle non-food items during the process.

, Most food will need to be cut up so that it can fit more easily into the jars.



Peel and cut up fruits or vegetables. Note that you can ""slip"" certain fruits. Peel peaches, nectarines, and tomatoes by dipping them briefly in boiling water until the skins split open. Then, use a strainer to remove them and place them in cool water. When they are cool enough to handle, slip the skins right off them.
Remove pits, stems, cores, and any other part you don't eat. Note that freestone peaches are those that readily relinquish their pits, whereas cling peaches tend to cling. Choose your fruit accordingly.

Cook jam.
Cook and/or soak pickles.
Prepare relish, applesauce, apple butter, and other foods according to their recipes.

, Most fruits and vegetables are canned either in syrup (a mixture of water or juice and sugar) or brine (a mixture of water and salt). See your specific recipe to see which is called for.

Basic canning syrup: For light syrup boil 6 cups of water and 2 cups of sugar. This will yield 7 cups of syrup. For medium syrup boil 6 cups of water and 3 cups of sugar. This will yield 6 ½ cups of syrup. For heavy syrup boil 6 cups of water and 4 cups of sugar. This will yield 7 cups of syrup.Sugar can be replaced by Splenda or Stevia for a low-calorie option. Do not use Nutrasweet.


Basic pickling mixture: Place 5 cups (1.2l) vinegar, 1 cups (240ml) water, 4 tsp. (20g) pickling salt, 2 tbsp. (28g) sugar and 2 cloves of garlic (optional but adds to the flavor) in a pot. Bring the pot to a boil. Once at a boil, reduce it to a simmer for 10 minutes. Remove the garlic cloves after the mixture has simmered for 10 minutes.

, It is important to sterilize the jars because if there is any bacteria in the jars when you put the food in and seal them, your canned food can go bad. If you are at high altitude, add an additional minute for each 1,000 feet (304.8 m) above sea level. Then, place them upside-down on a clean towel and drape another towel over them until you are ready to use them.


You can also sterilize your jars by placing them in the dishwasher. Run the dishwasher for a whole cycle.

, Remove the pan from the heat. Place the jar seals into the water. Push them down so that they sink, and try not to stack them on each other, so that they heat evenly. Allow them to soften for a minute or two. You can start this step while you fill jars and wipe rims, if you time it right.

, This step is also called packing the jars. Foods are said to be ""hot-packed"" or ""cold-packed"" depending on whether they are cooked and packed into jars hot or simply cut up and packed into jars cold. This difference may affect your cooking time for the same food, so be sure to read the recipe carefully.


A canning funnel will make the job easier, especially for small pieces and liquid or semi-liquid foods.
For items in individual pieces, such as string beans, arrange them in the jar. Do this as neatly as you wish. If you'll be showing the jars in a fair, you may wish to pack very neatly. On the other hand, if you'll just dump them in soup someday, it may not be worth the bother to line them all up perfectly.

, The head space is necessary The head space varies between about an eighth of an inch (3mm) and an inch (25mm) depending on the food, so check instructions specific to whatever you are canning.

, Preservatives used in home canning include sugar, salt, and acids such as lemon juice and ascorbic acid (better known as Vitamin C) sold in powder form with other canning supplies. Add the preservative before adding the liquid, so that pouring the liquid over it mixes it in.

, Leave a ½-inch of space at the top of the jar.

, When you pour liquid over loose pieces, you'll leave air bubbles. Remove them by running a long, plastic knife (also available with canning supplies) down along the sides and jiggling or gently pressing the food.

, Make especially sure to clean the top surface where the seal will sit.

, A magnetic lid wand will help you get them safely out of the boiling water. To release the seal, set it on a jar and tilt the wand.


If you don't have a lid wand, you can use a small pair of tongs. Just don't touch the lids with your hands.

, Don't tighten so much that you press all the seal material off of the rim., Water bath canning works for many cooked foods (relish, pickles, jam) and acid fruits (applesauce, peaches, pears, apricots). Check a current recipe to be sure water bath canning is adequate for your food.


Lower the jars onto a rack in a water-bath canner or large stock pot. Add enough water to cover them by 1-2 inches (2.5-5cm). Remember to add hot water if the jars are hot-packed and cold water if the jars are cold-packed. Avoid subjecting jars to sudden, drastic changes in temperatures. You can measure it to the first knuckle, as shown. Don't stack jars in a water-bath canner.

,


Cover the canner and bring the water to a gentle boil. Boil for the specified time, adding to the processing time if you're more than 3,000 feet (914.4 m) above sea level.

, Pressure canning is necessary for meats and most vegetables because they do not have enough acid in them. Pressure canning can also reduce the processing time for foods like peaches and tomatoes, compared to water bath canning. To prevent certain harmful bacteria from forming, it is necessary to process low-acid foods at a higher pressure. Pressure canners raise the temperature by building up pressure inside. Typically, it is necessary to raise the temperature to 240F (116C) to kill these bacteria.


Arrange the jars in the pressure canner. For smaller jars, you may be able to stack them, as long as you offset them. That is, instead of putting a jar bottom directly on a jar lid so it nests, straddle a jar bottom across the rims of other jars.
Check your gasket before you begin pressure canning each year. They tend to dry out when they sit on a shelf. It must be able to form a seal. You may be able to revive a somewhat dry gasket by soaking it in just-boiled water. If your gasket is too old or cracked, replace it. You'll need to replace your gasket every year or two.
Place the lid on the pressure canner and twist it firmly closed. Often the handle position will indicate what is closed. Remove the rocker from the lid of the canner.
Bring the pressure canner to a boil. Watch the steam coming out of the opening where the rocker will go. There is usually also an indicator pin in the center. This pin will pop up as steam builds inside the canner.
Allow the steam to vent for a period of time. When it is rushing out of the vent in a strong, even stream, it is called a ""full head of steam"". Let the canner vent with a full head of steam for seven minutes or as specified in your recipe or canner's instructions.
Place the rocker on the vent and start timing the specified process time. The needle on the pressure gauge will begin to rise.
Adjust the temperature on the stove so that the pressure in the canner is what is specified in your recipe, adjusted for altitude. This pressure is typically 10psi (gauge pressure) at sea level. You'll generally have to make multiple small adjustments to get the pressure right. It will take a few moments to see the effects of each adjustment, since a large pot full of water and jars needs to change before your needle shows the change.
Attend pressure canners for the entire cooking duration, adjusting the temperature as necessary. Drafts and other variations will cause it to continue to shift. Lower the heat slightly if the pressure is too high and raise it if the pressure drops. Don't assume that you have reached the balance point, since drafts and other variations can disrupt the pressure fairly quickly. A pressure that is too low could fail to cook sufficiently hot; one that is too high could run the risk of breakage.
Process the jars for the full time stated in the recipe then Turn off the heat, leaving the rocker on until the indicator pin drops. When the pin drops, remove the rocker and allow the canner to vent for a few minutes.
Open the lid slowly and hold it between yourself and the jars for a few moments. You can even rest the lid loosely open on the pot rim for a minute or so. It doesn't happen very often (especially if you're careful to relieve the pressure gradually), but pressure canned jars occasionally break when the pressure is released.

, Jar tongs are a secure and safe way to do this, or you may be able to raise the entire basket in a water-bath canner. Place the jars on a clean towel to cool.

, You may hear the metal lids make a loud plinking sound. That is simply the contents cooling and creating a partial vacuum in the jar. Don't touch the lids yet. Let them seal on their own.

, The vacuum created when the contents cooled should have pulled the ""dome"" lid down very tightly. If you can press the center of the lid down, it did not seal. It should not spring back. If any jars have not sealed, you can place a fresh lid on them and process them again or refrigerate those jars and use the contents soon.

, You can remove the rings at this point, since the seals should be holding themselves on securely. Allow the rings and jars to dry thoroughly before replacing the rings, to prevent rust.

, Also consider writing the contents, since apple and peach can be hard to tell apart a month later. Write your name, too, if you are giving the jars as gifts. You can use a sticker or a permanent marker.


Mark your jars on the seals rather than the glass if you want to reuse the jars easily. Store sealed jars on a shelf, avoiding excessive exposure to heat or light. Refrigerate after opening.

Choose glass canning jars that are in good condition.,
Wash the jars and lids with soap and water.,
Sterilize the jars in boiling water.,
Dry the jars.",How to Can Pumpkin1," The jars should be free of cracks or chips to prevent any air from bleeding in after the canning process and to prevent the glass from breaking under pressure. They should also have metal lids that screw on securely. Two-piece lids tend to have the best seal.;
, Fill the sink with hot water and dish detergent. Use a clean dishcloth to scrub the inside and outside of each jar with the soapy water. The jars need to be cleaned thoroughly; any lingering bacteria can cause the pumpkin to go bad quickly even after being canned.

, As an additional precaution, you should sterilize the canning jars and lids in hot water. Fill a large stockpot with water and set it to a boil. Dip the jars and lids into the water and allow them to stay there for 15 minutes. Remove them with jar tongs.

, You can dry them out with a dish towel, or you can allow them to air dry by tipping them upside-down in a dish drying rack.

Prepare the fruit for canning.,
Clean 9 glass pint (500mL) canning jars and metal lids with soap and hot water.,
Prepare a simple sugar syrup.Heat water to a boil and dissolve sugar in the following proportions:


For a very light syrup with the fewest amount of calories add 3/4 cup (180 mL) of sugar to 6 1/2 cups (1.5 L).,
Fill the clean jars with the washed and prepared fruit.,
Wipe the rims of the jars with a clean cloth, shake gently to allow air bubbles to escape and cover with the metal lids.,
Place the cover securely on the canner and heat water to boiling.,
Process jars in the pressure canner,adjusting the process time and pressure based on your altitude and the type of fruit you are canning.Start timing when the necessary pressure is reached.,
Turn off heat and allow pressure to return to 0 PSI (0 kPa), then remove the weights or open the vent and wait for 2 minutes.,
Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter and place them on a wooden board or thick kitchen towel to allow them to cool in a draft free area.,
Label the jars with ingredients and the date, then store in a cool, dark and dry location.

",How to Can Fruit1," Select ripe, unblemished and unbruised fruit. Wash the fruit under cool running water, and gently scrub them with a vegetable brush if necessary.


Fruits such as apples, pears and stone fruits should be peeled, sliced and cored or deseeded.
Remove the stems and leaves from the fruits if necessary.;
, Keep the jars and lids hot until they are ready to be filled.


Jars and lids can be kept hot by placing them upside down in a pot of hot water or by washing them in a dishwasher and keeping them in the dishwasher until needed.

,
For a light syrup, ideal for very sweet fruits, add 1 1/2 cups (360 mL) of sugar to 5 3/4 cups (1.4 L) of water.
For a medium syrup, ideal for sweet apples, cherries and berries, add
2 1/4 cups (532 mL) of sugar to 5 1/4 cups (1.2 L) of water.
For a heavy syrup, good for tart fruits, add 3 1/4 cups (769 mL) of sugar to 5 cups (1.2 L) of water.

, Cover the fruit with the sugar syrup allowing 1 inch (2.5 cm) of air space at the top of the jars. Stir jars to allow air bubbles to escape.


If you wish to use the hot pack method, instead of canning raw fruit, add fruit to the sugar syrup, return to a boil, cook the fruit for 2 to 3 minutes and fill the jars immediately.
If canning low-acid fruits with a pH level higher than 4.6, such as Asian pears, add 1 tbs (14.8 mL) of bottled lemon juice. , Place the sealed jars on the rack in the pressure canner filled with 3 quarts (2.8 L) of hot water. The jars must not sit directly on the bottom of the canner, and should not touch each other to allow steam to flow freely around them.

, Allow steam to vent from the canner for 10 minutes before adding canner weights or closing vents. After 10 minutes close vents or put on weights (depending on the type of pressure canner you are using) and allow the pressure to build.

, Check the gauge frequently to ensure the pressure remains constant.

, Carefully remove lid and allow steam to escape.

, Keep 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of space between jars to allow air to circulate.


Listen for a small “ping” sound indicating that the seal of the jar lids has been sucked down and the jars are properly sealed. This could take around 12 hours.

Before you begin, decide how many jars you want to end up with and choose the appropriate amount of apples accordingly.,
Find a way to keep the jars and lids heated.,
Wash apples in cold water.








,
Peel and core apples, removing all bad spots, and place immediately in a large bowl of water(apple water).








,
Slice apples between 1/4-1/2 inch thick.








,
Add three tablespoons of lemon juice to the apple water to keep apple slices from turning brown.,
Blanch apples in boiling water for five minutes.,
Spoon the hot apple slices into the hot jars, leaving a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of free space at the top of the jar.,
Fill the jar with remaining liquid/syrup from blanching pot.








,
Decide if you want your apples extra sweet.,
Wipe off all spills and sugar from the jar using a rag or paper towel, paying particular attention to the lid area.,
Place jars in can, leaving 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of water above the jars.








,
Calculate the canning time.",How to Can Apples,"









For 3 1-pint (473 ml) jars, use 10 lbs. (4.54 kg) of apples.
For 7 1-pint (473 ml) jars, use 12 1/4 lbs. (8.62 kg) of apples.
For 9 1-quart (946 ml) jars, use 19 lbs. (5.56 kg) of apples.
One bushel of apples yields approximately 17-19 quart (946 ml) jars and 21-25 pint (473 ml) jars.;
, Jars and lids should be placed in a dishwasher &/or oven to keep hot until use. Heat/wash jars and lids for sterilization then keeping the jars hot will prevent breakage. Boil lids until placed on jars. This helps create a clean sterile seal. Remember to use your magnetic lid lifter.








,,,, Be careful not to add too much lemon juice this will result in sour apples!








, You only want to heat up the apples not cook them; otherwise you will have applesauce before you know it.









This blanching stops the enzymes from degrading the flavor during storage.

, Pack the apples into the jars tightly.








,, If the apples need a little extra sweetness, add 1-2 tablespoons of sugar on top. The sugar will then dissolve and be absorbed by the apples during the processing.








, Place the jar lid on the jar and tightening until secure.








,, Canning time varies depending on the type of canner and the altitude of your location. Always check your canner instructions. Here are some general cooking-time guidelines for use with a water canner:









0–1,000 feet (0.0–304.8 m) above sea level cook for 20 minutes
1,001–3,000 feet (305.1–914.4 m) cook for 25 minutes
3,001–6,000 feet (914.7–1,828.8 m) cook for 30 minutes
above 6,000 feet (1,828.8 m) cook for 35 minutes.

If you use a dial gauge pressure canner. A weighted gauge pressure canner needs about 8 minutes. Verify with instruction manual.

Soak the jalapenos in the ice water solution.,
Refrigerate the jalapenos.,
Drain and rinse the peppers.,
Soak the peppers in clean water.,
Rinse, soak, and drain the peppers twice more.",How to Can Jalapenos2," Stay away from soft peppers or spotty, diseased peppers. Instead, opt of ripe, firm jalapenos that are a vibrant green, yellow, or red.

, Each slice should be about 1/4-inch (6.45-mm) thick. Use a sharp knife to make clean cuts, or use a mandolin slicer if there is one available. Throw out the stem end.

, Be careful as you work, since inhaling too much of the lime dust can irritate your respiratory system.

, Stir the peppers into the solution to make sure that they are all moistened.

, Transfer the container of lime water and jalapenos to the refrigerator and keep it there for 12 to 24 hours. Stir the peppers every few hours as they continue to soak.

, After they finish soaking, drain the lime water from the peppers by pouring the contents of the container through a colander. Rinse the jalapeno slices with running water.

, Place the peppers in a clean container and cover them with cold water. Refrigerate them as they soak for an hour to remove any additional lime. Drain the water again.

, The process may seem excessive, but it is important to follow in order to remove all the lime and to reduce the number of seeds that get preserved.

Boil water inside a boiling-water canner.,
Combine the mustard seed and celery seed.,
Distribute the seed mixture into the jars.,
Place a funnel in the top of each jar.,
Transfer the pepper rings into each jar.,
Boil the vinegar, canning salt, and purified water.Combine the three ingredients in a saucepan and heat them over high heat, stirring occasionally.,
Ladle the brine solution over the jalapenos.,
Wipe the rims of the jars clean.,
Place the lids on the jars.,
Process the jars in a boiling-water canner.,
Remove and cool the jars.,
Check the seals.,
Store the peppers in a dry location.",How to Can Jalapenos3," As you prepare the jars for canning, you should get your canner ready. Fill the canner with enough water to completely submerse the jars in. Position a jar rack inside the bottom of the canner to prevent the jars from sliding around.


If you do not have a boiling-water canner, you can use a large, heavy stockpot instead. Make sure you still place something at the bottom of the stockpot to prevent the jars from moving around later on, though.

, Mix the two seasonings together evenly in a small dish.

, Spread equal amounts of the seed mixture into each pint-size (500 ml) jar until all of the mixture has been used.

, Use a wide-mouth funnel, if available, to make it easier to pack the peppers into each jar as you work.

, Distribute equal amounts of the peppers into each jar using a large serving spoon or measuring cup. Leave 1 inch (2.5 cm) of empty headspace in between the peppers and the top of each jar.

, Once the salt is dissolved and the solution has reached a boil, remove it from the heat.

, Use a ladle to pour the vinegar brine into the jars, covering the peppers completely and filling in any air pockets further down inside the jar. Leave 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) empty headspace.

, If anything got onto the rims of the jars as you worked, it is important to clean it off with a clean, damp cloth. Excess seasoning or brine could actually interfere with the lids and prevent them from sealing correctly.

, Two-piece metal canning lids work best. Screw the lids onto the jars, stopping once you feel resistance. Do not tighten the lids too much, since doing so can cause damage to the jars.

, Carefully lower the jars into the boiling water inside the canner using jar tongs. Do not allow them to bump as you move them, and do not allow them to touch once they are sitting in the canner. The amount of time you need to process them for will vary depending on your altitude.At 1000 ft (304.8 m) or below, process the jars for 10 minutes.
Between 1,000 feet (304.8 m) and 6000 ft (304.8 m to 1.83 km), process the jars for 15 minutes.
Above 6000 ft (1.83 km), process the jars for 20 minutes.

, Use jar tongs to carefully remove the jars of jalapeno slices. Let them cool in a draft-free spot for 12 to 24 hours.

, If the center button on the lids pop up and down, the lids have not sealed and the peppers are not safe for long-term storage. If the button does not move, however, the lids have sealed correctly.

, A kitchen cabinet or pantry works well. Shake the jars to disperse the seasonings evenly before serving.

Use ripe pie pumpkins.,
Wash the exterior of the pumpkins.,
Cut the pumpkin in half.,
Scrape the seeds out.,
Cut the pumpkin into wedges.,
Fill the bottom half of a large double pot steamer with water.You could also use a large stockpot with a steaming basket inside.

,
Place the pumpkin wedges inside the top portion of the steamer.,
Boil the water and steam the pumpkins.,
Alternatively, cook the pumpkins in the microwave.,
Let cool slightly.,
Peel the skin off.,
Cut the pumpkins into cubes.",How to Can Pumpkin2," These pumpkins are also called sugar pumpkins because they have a little more sweetness and a little more flavor than larger pumpkins. Pumpkins with a deep orange color and hard rind tend to be the most flavorful and the most ripe. Avoid using pumpkins that are moldy or rotted.

, It is important for the outside of the pumpkin to be clean in order to prevent bacteria from contaminating the inner flesh. Scrub the exterior in warm water, but do not use soap. Pat it dry with a clean dish towel or paper towels.

, Use a large serrated knife and carefully saw the pumpkin in half. Set the pumpkin down with the stem up on a smooth counter top. Hold it steady with one hand and use your other hand to saw the knife back and forth through the pumpkin until the two halves are separated.


Do not use a smooth knife. A smooth knife does not have enough of a ""grip"" for pumpkins and is more like the slip and hurt you as you cut.

, A heavy ice cream scoop accomplishes the task well, but any large metal spoon will work. Continue scraping the inner sides of the pumpkin until all the strings and seeds have been gutted out.

, The cooking process will be much easier if the pumpkin is cut into smaller pieces. Each half can be cut into about four pieces. Be sure to cut away the stem and discard it, as well.

,, Position the wedges so that the flesh faces downward. Make sure that the lid of the steamer or pot will fit securely over the pumpkins, since you will need the steam to cook the pumpkin and a loose lid will allow the steam to escape.

, Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Steam the pumpkins for 20 to 30 minutes or until soft.

, If you do not have a double steamer, you can cook the pumpkins by placing them into a large microwavable glass bowl and adding 2 inches (5 cm) of water. Microwave on high in 10 minute increments until soft. Usually, this takes 20 to 30 minutes.

, Before attempting to peel or cut the pumpkin, you should give it a little time to cool down. Otherwise, you may end up burning yourself. Wait until the pumpkin rind is cool to the touch before handling further.

, Hold the pumpkin still with one hand, using an oven mitt if it is still somewhat hot. With the other hand, carefully slide a blunt knife in between the skin and the flesh. When the skin starts coming up, finish peeling the rest away with your fingers.

, The cubes should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) all around. Do not mash the pumpkin.

Process the jars for 55 minutes.,
Turn off the canner and let cool.,
Remove the jars and let cool.,
Check the seals.,
Store sealed jars in a dark, cool area.",How to Can Pumpkin3," If you still have the liquid you cooked the pumpkins in, this can be reused. Otherwise, boil about 4 pints (2 liters) of fresh water.

, Use your hands or a large spoon. Do not mash the cubes into the jar. Instead, allow them to sit somewhat loosely. Leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of headspace or empty space in between the pumpkins and the top of the jar.

, Pour the water slowly to prevent it from splashing out and to allow it to fill the empty spaces in between the cubes of pumpkin. Make sure that approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) of empty headspace still remains in each jar.

, Make sure that the lids are screwed on securely. If the lids are too loose, you will not be able to create a seal during the canning process.

, Heat the water to boiling. You must use a pressure canner when canning pumpkin.

, Use jar tongs to carefully place the jars on the rack inside the canner. Do not allow the jars to clink together as you move them. If the jars do collide, they may crack.

, Put the heat on high while the pressure valve is still open. Allow the steam to escape through this vent for ten minutes to purge the air inside.

, You will also need to set the weight, but the amount of weight will vary depending the time of pressure canner used as well as your present altitude.


If using a dial-gauge pressure canner, set the weight to 11 lb (4.99 kg)for altitudes up to 2000 feet (609.6 m). Add 1 lb (0.45 kg) of weight for every additional 2000 feet (609.6 m), stopping at 14 lb (6.35 kg).
If using a weighted-gauge pressure canner, set the weight to 10 lb (4.54 kg) for altitudes up to 1000 feet (304.8 m). For any higher altitude, set the weight to 15 lb (6.8 kg).

, If using quart-size (liter-size) jars, however, you will need to process the pumpkin for 90 minutes.

, Turn off the heat after the jars have finished processing. After the pressure drops to zero, wait three additional minutes and open the vent to release the steam.

, Open the canner and lift the jars out with jar tongs. Set them to dry and cool in a draft-free area. Do not allow them to touch or bump into each other.

, After the jars have cooled overnight, press on the center of each lid to check the seal. If it does not move, the jars have been sealed properly. If the center button ""pops"" or moves up and down when pressed, the jars have not been sealed and are not safe for long-term storage.

, A basement or refrigerator works best.

If you wish to use the hot pack method, instead of canning raw fruit, add fruit to the sugar syrup, return to a boil, cook the fruit for 2 to 3 minutes and fill the jars immediately.
If canning low-acid fruits with a pH level higher than 4.6, such as Asian pears, add 1 tbs (14.8 mL) of bottled lemon juice. , Place the sealed jars on the rack in the boiling-water canner filled halfway full of hot water. Add additional hot water until there is 2 inches (5 cm) of water above the tops of the jars.The jars must not sit directly on the bottom of the canner, and should not touch each other to allow steam to flow freely around them.

, Process jars in the boiling-water canner, for the recommended process time based on your altitude and the type of fruit you are canning. Start timing when the water has returned to a boil.


Add additional boiling water if the water level lowers below 2 inches (5 cm) above the tops of the lids.
Maintain a vigorous boil throughout the entire processing time (usually between 20 and 30 minutes.)

, Keep 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of space between jars to allow air to circulate.


Listen for a small “ping” sound indicating that the seal of the jar lids has been sucked down and the jars are properly sealed. This could take around 12 to 24 hours.

Enjoy your canned carrots throughout the year.",How to Can Carrots," The best candidates for canning will be carrots that are crisp, tender, and fresh. You'll have the best results with those that are roughly 1 to 1¼ in (2.5 to 3.2 cm) thick at the base of the carrot.


Larger carrots often have too high of fiber content to work well with canning.;
, You can do this with a sharp paring knife. If your carrots still have leaves and/or a stem attached, you should trim these off so only the meat of the carrot remains. Also, if you notice discolored or decayed parts on your carrots, these should be removed.


Cut roughly 1 in (2.5 cm) below the woody, stiff part of the stem to remove it from the meat of the carrot., Running cool water over your carrots should be enough to remove bacteria and dirt from your carrots, especially if they are relatively clean. If your carrots are fresh from the garden or quite dirty, a stiff bristle brush can help you remove dirt from their surface., You can do this either with a paring knife or a potato peeler. Take the knife or peeler and cut free the outer skin of the carrot. Once you are finished, you can throw away the peeled skin or compost it., After peeling, you should rinse your carrots again in cool water before cutting them with a suitable knife, like a paring knife. Be careful not to cut your carrots no thinner than about 1/8 of an inch (.32 cm) thin. They'll be cooked in your pressure canner, and smaller pieces can become mushy.Depending on the thickness and length of your carrots, you may only need to cut them lengthwise. Longer carrots might need to be cut lengthwise and then into parts widthwise.

, You can do this easily with your home dishwasher. Simply set it to ""sanitize"" and allow it to run through a cycle with your jars and lids inside. Once the cycle is finished, your jars will be ready for canning.


If you do not have a dishwasher, you can preheat your oven to 225°F (107.2°C), put your jars in a roasting pan, and insert the jars into your oven for about 20 minutes. Use caution when removing the jars. They'll be very hot after sterilizing.
You can also use a water bath canner to sterilize your jars. Place your jars onto the rack of the canner and fill it with enough water so the jars are filled. Boil the jars in the canner for 10 minutes, then use your jar lifter to remove the hot jars.Lids cannot be sterilized through the previously mentioned methods. Doing so can damage the sealing compound on them. Lids can be sterilized by submerging them in water and then simmer the water in a saucepan. Do not bring your water to a rolling boil. Simmer the lids for 5 to 10 minutes and then remove them with tongs., In a large pot on your stove top, bring water to a rolling boil. You might also want to add salt to your water, though this is not necessary. If you choose to do so, add ½ tsp of salt per pint (473 mL), and 1 tsp per quart (liter) of water.


This method is referred to as ""hot packing."" However, you can also raw pack carrots. To do this, simply pack the raw carrots into your canning jars tightly, leaving about 1 in (2.5 cm) of headspace.Salt is often added to canned vegetables to add to the flavor of the vegetable. If you like your vegetables plain, you should skip adding salt to your water., Different pressure canners will have different features, so you should always follow the directions that came with your pressure canner for best results. The altitude of the area you live will influence the setting you need to use with your pressure canner, so you should adjust your canner accordingly.Canner Adjustment TableAltitude in Feet

, Since your pressure canner will also cook the carrots, you don't need to boil them in the water for a long period of time. Five minutes will be enough to prepare your carrots for canning., You should use the method that works best for you. In some cases, you might find that you can pour the hot water and carrots into the jar from the pot. For large quantities, this might not be feasible, in which case you might want to use tongs to remove the carrots.


Carrots should be packed relatively tightly in the jars and each jar should have about 1 in (2.5 cm) of open space between the top of your carrots/water and the lip of the jar.
If you removed your carrots with tongs, you'll need to pour the boiling water into the jars with the carrots., First wipe the lids with a piece of paper towel or a lint free cloth. Then, place the metal lids of your canning jars so that each lid is centered on the mouth of the jar. After that, screw the band of the lids of your jars until they are finger tight.Be careful while doing this. The jars will have likely become very hot with the heat of the carrots and the water.
You may want to hold the jars in place with an oven mitt, pot holder, or several layers of cloth (like a folded dish towel) to protect your hand from heat and keep jars stationary while attaching the lids.

, Again, different canners may have slightly different procedures. Generally, you'll need to leave your jars in the canner for about 10 minutes, leaving the weight off but the lid on.At this point, the jars will likely be quite hot. You may need to use a pair of tongs or an oven mitt to move your jars from where they are to the pressure canner.

, For most pressure canners, after 10 minutes have passed, you'll need to close all openings until the pressure gauge reaches 10. For most pressure canners, you'll want to maintain this level of pressure for about 25 minutes.Set a timer on your phone or use a kitchen timer so you don't forget about your carrots and end up with a big mess.

, Depending on factors like your altitude, climate, and equipment, this could take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour. Before opening your canner but after it has cooled, open the pressure valves and wait until the valve gauge reaches 0.

, Residual heat can remain in your jars for quite some time. Allow the jars to cool slowly and naturally by leaving them out in a safe place in your kitchen overnight.Be careful not to leave jars where children or family member might accidentally touch them.

, An improper seal can lead to dangerous bacteria growing in your jars. You can check the seal by gently poking the top of the jar with your finger and listening for a popping sound. If you hear this or feel the lid flex under your finger, the jar is improperly sealed.


Improperly sealed jars can be stored in the refrigerator and eaten as you would normally.
You can also repeat the process to reseal the jar, but in many cases, this can result in the carrots becoming overcooked., Canned vegetables can last for up to two years and can last for 7 to 10 days after opening if you refrigerate them.You may want to store your carrots in cold storage or your basement so they are easily accessible but out of the way.

Make chili.",How to Can Beans," Pick out any rocks and any extra shriveled or crushed beans. The damaged beans won't cook properly, so it's best to remove them.


If you want to be sure to catch them all, pour them onto a flat surface like a cooking sheet. Don't obsess over each bean; it's not a disaster if you don't catch every one.;
, Rinse the dried beans in room temperature water and place them in a large pot.

, After rinsing, fill the pot with water (at least twice as much volume as the beans fill)and soak the beans using one of two methods:



Overnight soaking: simply leave the beans in water for 8-12 hours. This method is the best for ensuring the beans absorb enough water to cook evenly all the way through.Quick soak: bring the pot of water and beans to a boil, then turn off the burner and let soak 1 hour. This will do the job much faster, but the beans won't cook as evenly.
The beans will expand as they absorb water, so leave space in the pot.
Broken and split beans will rise to the water's surface. Remove these.

, The water you used to soak the beans now contains dirt as well as some of the complex sugars that cause gassiness.Using a new pot of water to cook the beans is recommended.

, Cover the beans with fresh water and boil 30 minutes. You can add spices for additional flavor, or leave them plain so the canned beans have greater versatility.


Don't cook the beans as long as they would usually take (normally 60-90 minutes or more). The canning process will finish cooking the beans.
Optional: Add approximately 1/4 tsp (1mL) salt per pint (500 mL) of beans to better preserve color and flavor.Good ingredients for adding flavor to beans include garlic, red pepper, cumin, coriander, and lemongrass.Don't use all of these at once!

, Wash the jars and lids with hot, soapy water and place them in a pot of simmering or almost-boiling water. Putting them through a quick rinse dishwasher cycle immediately before use will also work.Do not use storebought jars (such as mayonnaise jars). These have a high chance to break or fail to form a proper seal.You need a glass, threaded jar with self-sealing lid intended for home canning.
You should clean the jars well, but you do not need to sterilize them. The pressure canner will accomplish that for you. (You should always sterilize jars before water bath canning, but that method will not remove the toxins that can thrive in canned beans.)Keep the lids in their own pot until you need to use them.

, They should be packed closely, but not pressed too firmly in, since they require room to expand and contract during canning.


Make sure your Mason jars are clean and their hermetic seals are intact before using.

, Leave about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of ""head space"" at the top of the jar., This will free any air bubbles trapped in your jars, which can weaken the seal and disrupt color and flavor., Use a clean cloth to wipe the rims of the jar. You don't want any contaminants inside your jar.

, Use tongs or a magnet to pull the flat lids out of the pot of boiling water and place them onto the jars. Screw the rim of each jar over the flat lid, protecting your hands with an oven mitt.

, A water bath canning method is dangerous for low-acid foods such as beans, which can harbor the potentially fatal botulism toxin when canned. You must use a pressure canner in order to completely kill any botulism spores that may be present.Always wash your canner with hot, soapy water (and nothing else), then rinse and dry before using., There should be approximately 2–3 inches (5–7 cm) of hot water.


Place the pressure canner on a stove top before you start adding hot water and heavy jars to it.

, Each pressure canner should come with at least one metal rack. Place this rim-side down at the base of the canner, so it is slightly raised from the canner base.

, Use a pair of jar tongs to place the full jars on top of the rack in the pressure canner.


Extra large canners may come with a second rack that can be fitted above one layer of jars and have a second layer placed on top of it.

, In some pressure canners this simply means placing the lid and turning to lock it. Others require you to tighten wing nuts attaching the lid to the canner.


Always tighten two opposite wingnuts at the same time., Turn on your stove burner and wait until steam begins escaping from the canner lid.


If your canner has a weighted gauge attachment, make sure it is not attached at this time., This process begins the creation of a hot, high pressure canning environment.

, These vary with pressure canner model, altitude, and type of bean, so it's best to follow the instructions that came with your canner. That said, here is a rough guide if you have no other source:Process the jars at 10–13 lbs (PSI) of pressure.
Increase the pressure to at least 15 lbs if you live at 1,000 ft (300m) altitude or above.
Lima beans take 40 minutes and (soaked) dry beans take 75 minutes.
Process extra large beans for an additional 10 minutes.
Take an additional 10 minutes if you're using quart jars (1 L) instead of pints (500 mL).

, There are two different types of gauges you can use.If our canner has both, use the weighted gauge method:


A dial gauge simply displays the current pressure of the canner. These should be checked for accuracy annually to ensure safe canning.
A weighted gauge set to the desired amount of pressure is screwed onto the steam vent on the lid after the steam has vented for 10 minutes. When the pressure reaches the desired level, the weight will ""jiggle"" or rock back and forth over the vent approximately once every 15–60 seconds.If the pressure drops below the desired amount (which you can tell from the dial reading or from the weight failing to jiggle), reset your cooking timer. The jars must be processed for the necessary length of time without the pressure ever falling too low.

If the pressure dial is too high or the weight jiggles too frequently, lower the heat. Canning at too high a pressure can be dangerous.

, Leave the canner in place and allow the pressure to reach zero before continuing. This could take a while.


Do not remove the weighted gauge until the canner has cooled. Even then, you should use oven mitts as the gauge can remain quite hot.

, Unlock the lid and tilt it away from you as you open so the steam doesn't burn you., Use jar tongs to place the jars on an out of the way surface and wait for them to cool completely. They can then be stored in a cool, dry place for years and remain edible.


To test whether the seal of the jar has held, temporarily remove the screwed-on rim and lift the jar by the flat lid. (Do this over the sink.) A good seal will hold the jar's weight without the lid popping off.

, Any variety of canned bean can add flavor to a salad or be the centerpiece ingredient.

, Turn your canned pinto beans or navy beans into refried beans, then use them to make bean dip or serve with Mexican food.

, Cook your beans further to make any variety of delicious chili, including vegan options.

Sort the moldy blueberries from the fresh ones.,
Pull off any stems.,
Consider raising the blueberries with one part vinegar and three parts water.,
Make sure that the blueberries are dry.",How to Store Blueberries1," Look for berries that have white, fuzzy mold and toss them out. The mold can be found around the stem area. You will also want to discard any berries that are too soft or wilted looking; they are too ripe and will rot quickly. Sorting the bad berries from the good ones will prevent mold from spreading., Most of the stems should have fallen off on their own, but it would be a good idea to go through the berries again and pick off any remaining stems. They won't harm you if you eat them, but they will taste bitter.

, In general, you should not wash berries until you are ready to eat them.Washing them too soon can lead to mold. Washing them with vinegar water, however, can kill mold spores and prevent from mold growing in the first place.Put the berries into a colander or strainer, and dunk them into a bowl filled with the vinegar water. Shake colander or strainer, then pull it out. Rinse the berries using cool water; this will get rid of any vinegar flavor.

, Any moisture left on the berries will cause them to mold too soon, so you will need to make sure that they are completely dry before storing them. There are a few ways in which you can dry the berries:


Line the inside of a salad spinner with a few paper towels and put the berries inside. Spin them for a few seconds until there is no more moisture.
Spread them out on a tray and let them air dry. Use a fan to speed up the process."

Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter and place them on a wooden board or thick kitchen towel to allow them to cool in a draft free area.,
Label the jars with ingredients and the date, then store in a cool, dark and dry location.

",How to Can Corn1," Select ripe, fresh corn with bright green husks and plump kernels.Peel and remove husk and silk from the ears of corn. Wash and scrub the ears of corn with a vegetable brush under cool running water.;
, Transfer the corn to a large bowl of ice-cold water to stop the cooking process.


Avoid cooking the corn for too long to avoid mushy kernels.

, Catch the kernels in a large bowl or on a baking sheet.


Avoid slicing into the cob, cutting only about 3/4 of the way through the kernels.
Set the bottom end of the cob on a small, overturned bowl to make slicing and collecting the kernels easier.

, Keep the jars and lids hot until they are ready to be filled.


Jars and lids can be kept hot by placing them upside down in a pot of hot water or by washing them in a dishwasher and keeping them in the dishwasher until needed.

, Add one tsp. (5 mL) of canning salt to each jar (optional), then fill jars with boiling water, while keeping 1 inch (2.5 cm) of air space at the top of the jars. , Place the sealed jars on the rack in the pressure canner filled with 3 quarts (2.8 L) of hot water. The jars must not sit directly on the bottom of the canner, and should not touch each other to allow steam to flow freely around them.

, Allow steam to vent from the canner for 10 minutes before adding canner weights or closing vents. After 10 minutes close vents or put on weights (depending on the type of pressure canner you are using) and allow the pressure to build.

, Check the gauge frequently to ensure the pressure remains constant.


For dial gauge canners, set pressure to 11 PSI (75.8 kPa) for altitudes of 0 to 2000 feet (0 to 610 m), 12 PSI (82.7 kPa) for altitudes of 2001 to 4000 feet (610 to 1220 m), 13 PSI (89.6 kPa) for altitudes of 4,001 to 6,000 feet (1,000 to 2,000 m) (1220 to 1830 m), and 14 PSI (96.5 kPa) for 6001 to 8000 feet (1830 to 2440 m).
For weighted gauge canners set pressure to 10 PSI (68.95 kPa) for altitudes of 0 to 1000 feet (0 to 305 m), and 15 PSI (103.4 kPa) for altitudes above 1,000 feet (304.8 m).

, Carefully remove lid and allow steam to escape.

, Keep 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of space between jars to allow air to circulate.

",How to Can Beets," Select firm, fresh beets with a diameter of 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm). Slice off the beet tops and trim roots, leaving one inch (2.5 cm) of the stem and root to reduce bleeding of color. Wash and scrub the beets with a vegetable brush under cool running water.;
, Remove the beets from hot water, carefully slide off their skins with a spoon or your hands and cut off remaining roots and stems. Transfer the beets to a large bowl of cold water to stop cooking process.


If the beets are different sizes, try cooking similar sized beets together as the larger beets will require a longer cooking time to remove skins.

, Small beets can be left whole.

, If the mushrooms are larger than 1 inch / 2.5 cm across, either slice them, or cut them into quarters.

, Mushrooms can be steamed or heated in fat in a fry pan. The deciding factor might be taste preference, or your desire to keep the mushrooms longer, as steamed mushrooms will keep about three months longer than those cooked in fat.

, Mushrooms that are going to be steamed will retain a better color if they are given an anti-darkening treatment first. To do this, dip the prepared mushrooms for 5 minutes in a solution containing 1 teaspoon lemon juice or 1 1/2 teaspoons of citric acid mixed into a pint of water.

, The steaming time is as follows:


Whole mushrooms - 5 minutes
Buttons or quarters - 3 1/2 minutes
Slices - 3 minutes.

, Drain and package. Leave 1/2 an inch (1.27 cm) of headspace.

, Steamed mushrooms will freeze for up to one year., Heat small quantities of mushrooms in margarine or butter in an open frying pan until almost done.

Cool the jars.,
Check the seals.",How to Can Asparagus Without a Pressure Canner," Either run three clean pint jars through the dishwasher or boil the jars for 10 minutes. If you choose to boil them, fill a large pot with water. Once you've sterilized the jars in the pot, turn off the water, so the jars stay warm.If you use the dishwasher to sterilize the jars, use them as soon as they're done and while they're still hot. Or, alternatively, place them in a warm oven until you're ready to fill and process them.;
, You'll need three new canning lids and bands. Fill a small saucepan halfway with water and bring it to a boil. Turn the heat off and place the three lids into the pot. This will help the seals soften, so they securely fit onto the jars. Just leave the lids in the pan while you prepare the asparagus.


You don't need to sterilize or warm the bands. You can keep them on your work space while you prepare the asparagus.

, Pour 2 1/4 cups (532 ml) of water and 2 1/4 cups (532 ml) of white distilled vinegar (5%) into a medium saucepan. Stir in 1/4 cup (68 g) of canning salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons of dill seed.It's important to use canning salt for pickling vegetables because other salts can make the brine cloudy.

, Turn the heat on to high and stir the brine. Continue to heat the brine until it boils rapidly. This will help the canning salt dissolve. Turn the heat off and set the brine aside while you prepare the asparagus., Run cold water and wash 5 pounds (2.27 kg) of asparagus under it.

, Look at your pint jars and decide how you want to cut and pack the asparagus. You can trim them so they fit into the jars vertically or you can cut them into small pieces (about 1 1/2-inches or 3.8 cm) so you can just fill the jars.If you want to can them vertically, consider using tall and thin pint jars.

, Peel 3 large cloves of garlic and put one clove of garlic in the bottom of each clean, warm pint jar. Fill the pint jars with the trimmed asparagus, so the jars are well packed.For spicy pickled asparagus, you can add one small hot pepper to each pint jar along with the peeled garlic.

, Put on a pair of hot pads and carefully pour the hot brine over the asparagus in your pint jars. You'll need to leave 1/2-inch (1.3 cm) of headspace at the top of each jar.If you're worried you might spill or splash the brine as you pour, consider placing a funnel on the pint jar and ladling the brine into the jar.
Fill the pint jars with the trimmed asparagus as described above so the jars are well packed..

, Ensure that there aren't any air bubbles in the jars and wipe the rims of the jars with a clean, dry cloth. Lift the lids of the jars out of the warm water using tongs. Set a lid on each jar and screw a clean band onto each jar. You should screw them on until they're just finger tight.Avoid screwing the lid on very tightly since this could prevent air from escaping as the jars process.

, Once the jars are full of the pickled asparagus, the jars will be very hot. Place a wire rack in the bottom of your water bath canner and use a jar lifter to carefully lower each jar into it. Add enough water to the canner, so the jars are covered by an inch or two (2.5 to 5 cm) of water. Bring the water to a boil and start the processing timer.

,, Lay a clean, dry towel on your work surface and turn the heat off of the water canner. Use the jar lifter to lift the processed jars out of the canner and set them on the towel. Let the jars cool for 12 hours to 1 day.Avoid any shocks in temperature. For example, don't set the hot jars on the counter next to an open window that has cold air blowing in. This could cause the jars to crack.

, You should hear the seals pop as they seal to the jar. Pull on the seals to ensure they're securely fastened. You shouldn't be able to lift off the lid using just your fingertips.


Always check your preserved food after storing it. Ensure that the seal is still good, that the brine isn't cloudy, and that the brine level hasn't dropped.

Find a basket-like container and wash it well.,
Fold a paper towel into quarters and place it in the bottom of the basket.,
Add the blueberries on top of the paper towel.,
Store the blueberries in the refrigerator.",How to Store Blueberries2," You can use a ceramic bowl with slits in it, or you can use the original plastic basket that the blueberries came in. The container will need to have small holes in it to provide adequate ventilation.


Avoid using anything made from metal. Blueberries can react with metal, leading to discoloration and stains on both the berries and the metal container., If you are using a larger container, such as a bowl, then use several sheets of paper towel; you do not need to fold them.

, The paper towel will help soak up moisture and prevent mold from developing., Avoid keeping them in the coldest part of the fridge, or they will get damaged from the cold.The best place to store the berries is on the middle or bottom shelf. Try not to keep them in the crisper. Most crispers are too humid and do not provide enough circulation. This could lead to mold.When kept in the fridge, blueberries can last five to ten days.


The coldest part of the fridge is the top."

Place the tray into the freezer and wait until the blueberries are frozen.,
Transfer the blueberries to freezer-safe Ziploc bag.,
Close the Ziploc bag and place it into the freezer.",How to Store Blueberries3," You will be freezing the berries individually first. This will prevent them from sticking and clumping together.You can also use a pan, casserole dish, or baking sheet. If you are using something made from metal, consider lining it first with parchment paper to protect the blueberries.

, It will take about two to three hours for the berries to freeze completely.

, Pull the tray out of the freezer carefully so as not to spill any of the berries. You can scoop them into the bag by hand or simply tip the tray over the opening of the bag.

, The berries will be good for up to one year.


You do not need to thaw frozen blueberries before baking with them, however rinsing them with cool water until the water runs clear may help prevent them from releasing too many juices during baking."

Prepare the corn for canning.,
Slice the corn from the cob using a sharp knife starting from one end of the cob and slicing down.,
Add the corn to 5 cups (1.2 L) boiling water for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.,
Clean 9 glass pint (500mL) canning jars and metal lids with soap and hot water.,

Wipe the rims of the jars with a clean cloth, stir gently with a clean, wooden spoon to allow air bubbles to escape and cover with the metal lids.,
Place the cover securely on the canner and heat water to boiling.,
Process jars in the pressure canner for 55 minutes, adjusting the pressure based on your altitude (see guide below).Start timing when the necessary pressure is reached.,
Turn off heat and allow pressure to return to 0 PSI (0 kPa), then remove the weights or open the vent and wait for 2 minutes.,
Remove the jars from the canner with a jar lifter and place them on a wooden board or thick kitchen towel to allow them to cool in a draft free area.,
Label the jars with ingredients and the date, then store in a cool, dark and dry location.

",How to Can Corn2," Select ripe, fresh corn with bright green husks and plump kernels.Peel and remove husk and silk from the ears of corn. Wash and scrub the ears of corn with a vegetable brush under cool running water.

, Catch the kernels in a large bowl or on a baking sheet.


Avoid slicing into the cob, cutting only about 3/4 of the way through the kernels.
Set the bottom end of the cob on a small, overturned bowl to make slicing and collecting the kernels easier.

, Avoid cooking the corn for too long to avoid mushy kernels.

, Keep the jars and lids hot until they are ready to be filled.


Jars and lids can be kept hot by placing them upside down in a pot of hot water or by washing them in a dishwasher and keeping them in the dishwasher until needed.

, Add one tsp. (5 mL) of canning salt to each jar (optional). , Place the sealed jars on the rack in the pressure canner filled with 3 quarts (2.8 L) of hot water. The jars must not sit directly on the bottom of the canner, and should not touch each other to allow steam to flow freely around them.

, Allow steam to vent from the canner for 10 minutes before adding canner weights or closing vents. After 10 minutes close vents or put on weights (depending on the type of pressure canner you are using) and allow the pressure to build.

, Check the gauge frequently to ensure the pressure remains constant.


For dial gauge canners, set pressure to 11 PSI (75.8 kPa) for altitudes of 0 to 2000 feet (0 to 610 m), 12 PSI (82.7 kPa) for altitudes of 2001 to 4000 feet (610 to 1220 m), 13 PSI (89.6 kPa) for altitudes of 4,001 to 6,000 feet (1,000 to 2,000 m) (1220 to 1830 m), and 14 PSI (96.5 kPa) for 6001 to 8000 feet (1830 to 2440 m).
For weighted gauge canners set pressure to 10 PSI (68.95 kPa) for altitudes of 0 to 1000 feet (0 to 305 m), and 15 PSI (103.4 kPa) for altitudes above 1,000 feet (304.8 m).

, Carefully remove lid and allow steam to escape.

, Keep 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of space between jars to allow air to circulate.


Listen for a small “ping” sound indicating that the seal of the jar lids has been sucked down and the jars are properly sealed. This could take around 12 hours.

Always check your fridge.,

Try to write down all the food you normally ended up throwing out due to dislikes about the food or you were not interested in eating.,

Think of ingredients that are both cheap and nutritious like: potatoes, tomatoes, pasta, multi-grain loaf of bread, eggs, beans, fruits, soup, fried rice, etc.,

Think of cheap meal plans you could carry out with your ingredients.,

Go generic whenever you can.,

Look for the ""Two for One"" coupons.,

Start with a small portion of the spicy ingredient and add to taste.,
Temper spiciness with additional un-spiced batches of the recipe.,
Serve the spicy food with a dairy-based drink, dip, or sauce.,
Add cream, milk, or cheese to liquid recipes such as soups and drinks.,
Mix in new ingredients that fit the flavor profile of the original recipe.,
Add sugar, honey, or another sweetener to detract from the meal’s spiciness.,
Pick out the spicy ingredient if possible.",How to Make a Meal Less Spicy," This allows you to gradually increase the spiciness of a recipe until it is at the desired level.









For ethnic dishes that you may not be familiar with, curries, chili peppers, chili sauces, and ground pepper spices can add a lot of heat even in small amounts, so starting with only a fraction of the quantity listed in the recipe can save a lot of hassle over adding the whole amount and regretting it later.;
, If you have enough time, a spicy rice dish can be toned down by cooking another half or whole portion and mixing it in with the original.








, Dairy products can help mitigate the spice factor in many meals.









Drinking milk with a spicy meal reduces the level of spiciness in the mouth.
Sour cream, plain yogurt, and cream sauces can help tone down spicy meat and vegetable dishes such as Cajun chicken or curried potatoes and carrots. Alternatively, you could add a cheese topping or butter sauce to temper the spiciness.
If you prefer having a side dish, try small scoops of cottage cheese or a dairy-based dip as an optional fire-quencher that can be served with the spicy item. A dairy-based dip or sauce also has the advantage of allowing guests to adjust the spiciness of the meal to their individual tastes.

, Unlike solid foods that require toppings or dips, liquid recipes can often benefit in taste and texture from mixing dairy ingredients directly into the recipe to reduce spiciness.









Heavy cream or low-fat milk can be added to many vegetable or milk-based soups to reduce the spiciness. Even bean, pumpkin, pea, seafood, and tomato based soups can go well with a dairy base, although broth-based soups should be taste-tested in small samples before adding cream or milk to cut the spice.
If cream does not pair well with a particular soup, adding shredded cheese or even an entire slice of cheese (one per bowl) upon serving can help temper the spiciness. Try cheddar cheese with a spicy potato and sausage soup and Swiss or provolone cheese with a beef-broth vegetable soup. Parmesan pairs well with many chicken broth soups and Italian soups, and soft mild cheeses pair well with tortilla soups and bisques.
If cream or milk is in short supply, a spoonful of sour cream for individual servings of soup can add both visual appeal and a cooling effect to many spicy vegetable or puree soups.

, Grains, vegetables, and meats can bulk up the flavor profile of many meals while simultaneously reducing their spiciness. It may even be better to add a new ingredient to a recipe if having a double batch of just one ingredient would make the meal imbalanced, particularly for one-dish meals.









For Indian curry dishes, try adding potatoes, carrots, peas, onions, rice, coconut milk, or plain yogurt (unflavored Greek yogurt or sour cream will work as well).
For Mexican food, try mixing in bell peppers, zucchini, tomatoes, beans, cheese, onions, corn, sour cream, or rice.
Asian recipes can typically accommodate broccoli, onions, carrots, snow peas, bell peppers, cabbage, or rice.

, This may especially help in Asian-inspired recipes, chicken or pork dishes, or recipes with fruit or seafood.









If you are nervous to change the main flavor of the dish with a sweetener, try mixing in some with just a small portion before applying the change to the remainder of the recipe.

, Some recipes that call for whole or chopped chili peppers and sauces may have large enough flecks or chunks to manually pick them out of the dish.









Be sure to remove them with a utensil to avoid getting the spicy oil on your hands; even after washing your hands, the oil can remain and irritate the skin or eyes.

Ordering meals that sound less unhealthy won't always guarantee that they are healthy.,
Never justify eating your entire meal because you paid for it.",How to Make Any Meal Into a Healthier One2," Salads can be just as bad as any entrée if they are loaded with dressing. Instead, order what you want to eat with any unhealthy aspects either taken off or put on the side (if you can handle having them there without feeling like you need to eat them).

, If you feel this way then remind yourself that the money you spent on the part of the meal that you didn't eat is just an investment in a healthier you or if you can take the rest of the food home and eat it later.


If you go to a restaurant and find the portions to be large, ask for a take-home box when your food arrives. Place half the meal into the box before you begin to eat. Plan on eating the rest later that day, if you get hungry, or tomorrow. This way you won't feel you've wasted money or food and you'll already have tomorrow's lunch ready to warm up.






Do a little research before you go to the restaurant. There are websites that list the ingredients/nutritional facts for restaurants.

"
Substitute any unhealthy element with a healthier counterpart.",How to Make Any Meal Into a Healthier One3," Use light sour cream instead of regular sour cream to take the spice off your Mexican food. Use avocado with salt instead of mayonnaise. Skim milk replaces whole milk (or whole milk instead of skim milk if you're able to cut back on carbs, as aforementioned), and so on and so forth.

, Don't bother to peel or remove stems, cores, seeds etc. Your colander will handle all of that later and the peel not only contains many nutrients, but (if using red apples) also will add a nice color to your sauce that will be very different from that jar you just bought at the grocers. For now, just concentrate on cutting the apples into uniform chunks for steaming.

, This prevents the possibility of burning the apples instead of just steaming them. Some apples are juicier than others and you can skip the water... but you'll need to experiment with your variety of apple to know how much water to add to get the finished consistency you want.

",How to Preserve Applesauce4,"
An old fashioned hand colander. This looks like a perforated cone with a wooden pestle. This is the most work intensive of the colanders available. You put the apples inside and smash them through the holes.
A Foley Food Mill. This looks like a saucepan with a perforated bottom and a paddle with handle that is turned to press the food through the grate. This is still quite labor intensive. You put the apples inside, place the mill over the sauce container, and press the cooked apples through the holes. Stems, seeds and skin are left behind, so you will need to do this in batches, removing the seeds, etc. periodically.
Victorio Strainer. This clamps to your counter top. You place the apples in the hopper at the top and crank the handle to corkscrew the apples through the long, cone shaped colander. Applesauce comes out the strainer; Seeds, stems and skin come out the hole on the end. You will need two catching containers... one for sauce, one for the un-sauceable portions of the apples.
A strainer attachment to a food processor (shown in the pictures) works like the Victoria Strainer, but the machine provides the cranking power, saving your arm a lot of work.

, Base your week's meals on what is on sale. Make a double batch and freeze half - that's a ""free"" meal next week.

, Write up a weekly menu. Try to shop once a week, except perhaps for produce.

,, This helps keep the food budget on track. Don't shop when you are hungry; eat some protein before you go.

, Most store brand groceries are just as good as their name brand counterparts, and they are typically cheaper. They are often produced by the same manufacturer. The only differences are the label and the price.

, Purchase dried herbs and spices in the ""ethnic"" section (in little cellophane bags) of the grocery store. They are much cheaper than the ones that come in little, glass jars. (Save and refill those little jars, if you like them.)


Sugar, flour and rice are often cheaper in bulk. Watch out though. Some institutional-sized canned foods are more expensive than their smaller counterparts. Check the prices per unit.

, Buy off-season meats; typically, roasts are sale items during summer months as steaks tend to be popular while roasts are not. Buy the sale meats and freeze. If you buy a large piece of meat, you may want to cut it into portions for quick thawing later.

,


Buy a whole chicken on sale, cut it up, and use it to make fried chicken or stir-fries. Use the bones and any bits of meat still clinging to them to make soup.
Learn to prepare and use dried beans, peas and lentils. They're good for you, and they're among the least expensive and most versatile foods you can buy.
Consider baking your own bread. With a machine, it's not very difficult, and you'll get better bread at a fraction of the price.
One quick check to guess at the profit margins for prepared goods is to compare the price per weight to that of the primary ingredient(s). If an 8-ounce package of cookies costs $4, that's $8 per pound. Look around, and you'll quickly notice that few unprocessed ingredients cost this much. Shrimp might, but not real butter, not fresh vegetables, and certainly not the flour, sugar, and hydrogenated oil that most likely make up the store-bought cookies.

,


Just about every grocery store has a ""sell-it-today"" section in the meat department. Use it. And cook it when you get home. You can save a lot of money doing this. And it's safe if you use it right away.
Buy a sack of ripe bananas now and then. You can use them to make banana bread or freeze them for use in smoothies.

, If you shop at a particular store regularly, find out when their shipments of different things arrive, and when their sales change.

, Remove rosemary from its stems. Chop up soft herbs such as cilantro or basil. Slip them into a zipper bag, write on the bag what it is (because you will never remember) with a waterproof pen. (Note: cilantro stems have just as much flavor as the leaves. Chop them very finely and you will not know the difference.) Of course, these frozen herbs will only be good for cooking, but so what! You can find many good recipes online to use up these tasty, frozen morsels of flavor.

, Chop up any carrots, celery, bell peppers, etc., that are starting to get a little old. Most vegetables must be partially cooked before freezing. Check a current freezer cookbook on how to prepare vegetables and fruits for freezing. Bell peppers and onions do not have a pre-treatment before freezing. Dice them up and flash freeze them on baking sheets. Then put them in a zipper bag, label it and freeze. Avoid freezing them in a big clump. Use these in soups, sauces, omelets. It's amazing what healthful tidbits you can secret into spaghetti sauce.

, Popcorn is easy to make and is usually inexpensive. Buy whole tortillas, slice them into pie-shaped triangles and bake for delicious, low-cost, low-fat (spray baking pan with Pam) chips.

, Check out cookbooks from the library showing how to make homemade food mixes.

, Compare the per-weight price of any packaged, processed cereal to that of plain, rolled oatmeal, and you'll see how much the boxes mark things up. There are lots of ways to eat that plain oatmeal, and you may just find that you like them. You can also make your own granola or muesli at home.

, You may be able to make the same item for much less without any difficulty. Examples:


Tomato soup is made from tomato sauce and water. (That is what the can says from a leading brand). Tomato sauce often sells for 8 cans/dollar (though usually 4 or 5 cans/ dollar). 25 cents is much cheaper than $1.50 for soup. The microwavable cans run $1.99!
A well known brand of hot sauce says it is ""aged"". It is made of vinegar, red pepper and salt. All vinegar is ""aged"". Make your own sauce with the ingredients probably already in your cabinet.
Another advantage of making your own is that you know what goes in. There are plenty of recipes on wikiHow and elsewhere online for all kinds of foods.

, Rice is durable and a staple food. A small bag of rice often runs $2 or $3. A 25 pound bag is only about twice as much for 10 times the quantity.


Make sure when buying foods in bulk that you will use that quantity. Even grains do eventually go bad.

, These shortcuts do not really save you time, but, pound for pound, they cost far more. Many also have lots of salt and other additives.


If you have a kitchen scale, weigh the cheese that's included with macaroni and cheese. A popular brand currently sells for $1.09 a box. A large bag of macaroni sells for less. Simply add the equivalent amount of processed cheese, or make a cheese sauce from real cheese instead.

, Buy milk or 100% fruit juice if you need it, but remember that most of the rest of the bottled drinks have an immense amount of sugar in them, and that most of the cost of a can of soda is in marketing and packaging—not in its contents.


Bottled water is extremely wasteful in terms of packaging and transportation, and it frequently consists of nothing more than filtered tap water, anyway. In most developed countries, tap water is perfectly safe to drink. Use a reusable water bottle and refill it from your tap. A water filter can help if you dislike the taste of your tap water.
If you like coffee or tea, make it for yourself, at home. Get a coffee maker with a timer on it, if you like. It will soon pay for itself.
If you'd like a sweet drink, make your own lemonade or smoothies.
Alcohol is expensive, so limit your alcohol to the occasional treat. Or, if you're particularly adventurous, try making your own mead, beer, or wine.

, Candy, cookies, and ice cream will all add a lot to your grocery bill (and your waistline), if you let them. If you like the occasional treat, buy the ingredients and make desserts for yourself.

, They have large sales when you buy things in cases. Most canned goods originally come in cases, but you don't have to take the case to get the deal.

Make sure you have all the required equipment before picking a meal to prepare.;
, Make sure it isn't too difficult. You may need your parent's help. There are lots of recipes and how to articles online.

. You may also ask for permission., If you don't have the specific ingredients, ask your parents to make a quick stop to a grocery store or choose a different recipe. Or, if you are an older kid, go to the store with the book or craft a quick list.

. Ingredients may come in different quantities. Just pick up the one that suits your meal plan., It can be huge when measuring out salt, pepper or any other spice. Use too much and the meal can be ruined.

. In this case, ""tsp"" means teaspoon and ""tbsp"" means tablespoon. The main difference is the sizes of the two spoons. In some recipes especially online ones, tablespoon may be represented by a capital T and teaspoon by a lower case t., Before you even begin, read over all the ingredients and instructions to make sure you understand and that you don't make a meal-altering mistake. Remember, you count more than the meal, so if you feel uncomfortable touching a hot pot or the oven, don't be afraid to ask your mom or dad for help. Or, if you are an older kid, do searches on the internet for a better understanding of the meanings of things. Phrase it how you would say it. Chances are you are not the first with the same question.


If while making the dish you sense that the food is not looking like mentioned in the recipe book, consult with someone who knows about the situation or you may taste a little and either take it off the heat if the dish is cooked or leave it on for a little longer if it tastes raw.
One way to know whether the food is getting cooked is the smell. When the dish smells like it is cooked, mostly but not always, it is a sign of it being ready. You may still taste it before stopping cooking.

, Once the heat is on, the ingredients must be ready otherwise you may keep the power on till the ingredients are washed, peeled, chopped etc. Also, you do not want to burn those ingredients already on the heat source.

While preparing a dish which requires spices to be added in hot oil, make sure that the spices are not let to heat for too long. Letting it cook when it turns dark brown or black should be avoided as it signals it being burned. To avoid burning, you must add the next ingredient to it.
If after preparation you feel that there is excessive spice or salt to the dish, you may add a cleaned potato cut from the center to the dish. Potatoes are said to absorb excessive spices, chili or salt from the dish.

, (Just in case something goes not as expected in what you are preparing).

Potatoes tastes good when cooked after boiling or when just fried till brown. It could work as a quick fix just in case you need to.
Make a simple dessert. Cut a few fruits and make fruit salad. It is healthy and the more the color to the fruit bowl, the more wholesome it will be. You may add some mint leaves for garnishing, or sprinkle some lemon juice or chocolate sauce as per what is available.

, Most likely, they will love it and thank you for being so nice! Food always tastes better when its made by someone else.

That way, you know exactly what you need, can avoid impulse items, and won’t leave the store having forgotten something you need. To make a comprehensive list:Go through your cupboards to see what staples you're running low on. This could include flour, sugar, canned goods, rice, spices, tea, and coffee.
Check your refrigerator to see if you need any fruits, vegetables, juice, or other beverages.
Create a planned menu for the next week or two. Look over the recipes you'll be making and ensure you have all the necessary ingredients.
Look through your storage closets and pantries to see if you need any bathroom or facial tissue, soaps, dish detergents, or other household goods.;
, If you're looking to save a few dollars at the grocery store, look through store flyers or online for the items that are on sale for the week.


If you find coupons for any items on your list, clip them out or make a note of the brand that’s on sale.
If you have a few grocery stores nearby, compare the prices of items listed in the flyers, and make lists of what items you intend to buy at each store to get the best price.
To avoid spending extra money, only use coupons and flyers for items you were already going to buy., Because you may be buying a large quantity of food, it’s always best if you can take your own vehicle or get a ride to the grocery store. Otherwise, determine a route you can walk or bike, or find what public transit routes will get you to the store you wish to shop at.


Don’t forget to take your reusable shopping bags with you.
If you're taking public transit or walking, consider using a rolling cart or large backpack that you can use to transport your groceries back from the store.

, When you get to the grocery store, locate a shopping cart (if you need a lot of items) or a hand-basket (if you only need a few items). This will make your shopping experience much easier.


Shopping carts and baskets are often located near or just inside the doors.

, If you brought reusable bags with you, don’t use them to carry your groceries: most stores prefer that you use the carts or hand-baskets.


Make sure you don’t crush smaller, delicate, or fresh produce items with larger items as you shop.
If you're using a cart, use the upper section near the handle for delicate things like fruit and eggs.

, The produce section is where you'll find all the fresh fruits and vegetables on your list, such as apples, oranges, bananas, lettuce, carrots, and other produce items.


While each fruit and vegetable has a different indicator of ripeness, you generally want to look for firm fruits and vegetables that aren't bruised, dented, or otherwise damaged.Try to buy fruits and vegetables in all colors to ensure you're getting the maximum vitamins and nutrients from your food.
Remember that fresh produce won’t last as long as frozen, so only buy what you and your family will eat over the next week or so.

, If you want to purchase fresh or specialty meat or seafood items, line up at the various counters. Wait your turn in line if there is one, and when it’s your turn, the person behind the counter will ask if you need help.


Don’t be afraid to ask questions about the products. You can even ask for samples if you aren't sure you'll like something.Remember that meat and seafood have short shelf lives if they aren't frozen, so only buy what you'll be able to eat.

, The bakery section is where you'll find items like bread, buns, and baked desserts like pies and cookies. Depending on your grocery store, you may even find fresh pizza dough, bread crumbs, crackers, and other baked goods in this department.


Sometimes, bakery departments will bake their own bread, and these loaves are often uncut. If you want the loaf sliced, take it to the bakery counter and ask them to slice it.
Many bakery departments also make fresh cakes that are baked to order, and you can have these customized and decorated for birthdays and other events. Talk to the people behind the bakery counter to find out what services they offer.

, All your dried, canned, and baking goods will be located in the aisles in the center of the store. This includes pasta, rice, sugar, flour, spices, crackers, and cookies, plus canned beans, soups, sauces, vegetables, and other staples.


When buying canned goods, avoid cans that are dented, punctured, or bulging. Canned goods are great to have on hand, because they last much longer than fresh staples like produce, meat, and bread.These center aisles are also where you'll find household items such as toilet paper and dish soap.

, In the freezers, you'll find frozen meat, prepared foods (such as burgers or meat pies), fruits and vegetables, and side dishes and snacks (such as ice cream and French fries). The refrigerators will hold dairy products, juices, prepared foods, packaged foods, and prepackaged meats.Frozen foods like fruits and vegetables that don’t have added ingredients (like salt or oil) are just as nutritious as fresh produce, and they are typically cheaper and will last longer. Just make sure you're going right home, otherwise your frozen items may start to melt!, Some grocery stores also have items available in bulk, and this could include spices, candy, snacks, dry goods like grains and pastas, and dried fruits and staples.


If you take any of these items, make sure you write down the bin number for each item. There will often be white twist ties you can use to seal your bags and write the bin numbers on. Look for pens located near the bags.
When buying items in bulk, pay attention to the price per weight. Sometimes things will be price per gram, pound, or another unit of measure, and this can add up quickly.
Some stores will have scales that you can use to weigh your produce or bulk items, and weighing your bags will give you an idea of the final cost of your bulk items.

, These tend to be located in the very middle of the store, right in the center of all the healthy grocery staples. This is where you'll find pop, chips, candies, and other unhealthy snacks. If you can avoid going down these aisles, the junk food will be out of sight and out of mind, so you won’t be tempted to buy it.


While it’s ok to indulge once in a while, junk food is not part of a healthy meal plan, and these types of foods tend to be very pricey.

, For convenience, checkout counters are usually located in between entrances or near exits. Each checkout counter will likely have a number above it, and if the number is lit up, that means the lane is open to use.


Most checkouts usually have express lanes that are reserved for customers who only have a few items. The express lanes will say how many items you can take through that lane. If you have more than the limit, use a regular checkout.
If you're in a hurry and looking for the quickest line, look for the line with the fewest people, regardless of how many items each person has in their cart. Paying takes longer than ringing items through, so the more people have to pay, the longer checkout will take., Line up behind the last person in the checkout lane you’ve chosen, but make sure you don’t crowd them with your cart or basket. Move toward the conveyor as the line shortens.


When space frees up on the conveyor belt, grab a rubber divider from the side of the checkout and place it on the belt to divide your groceries from those of the person ahead of you.
Start placing your items on the belt, but don’t crowd your food so that things get squished, bruised, or dented. More room will become available to you as the cashier rings through items ahead of you.
Place large items and boxes on the belt first, and leave delicate items and fresh produce until the end so that it doesn’t get crushed., Usually, grocery store conveyor belts have an open section underneath at the end of the conveyor (farthest from the cashier) where you can leave your hand basket.


Once you’ve emptied all your items, place the basket here. If there are others there already, stack yours inside.
If you're using a cart, however, push it through the line with you as you go.

, If you brought your own bags, now’s the time to use them! Some grocery stores require the customers to bag their own groceries, and in others the cashier will provide this service. .


If the cashier is bagging the groceries, hand over your reusable bags.
If you're bagging your own food, place larger items in the bottom and smaller and more delicate items on top.
Separate raw meats from the rest of your food by putting them in their own dedicated bag.
If you are buying eggs and loaves of bread, place the carton of eggs in the bottom of one of the bags and carefully place the bread on top. It's a good idea to put this bag in the ""seat"" of the cart so you know to place it in your car last in a safe place that won't have items placed or fallen on top of it.
Make sure the cashier rings items through before you bag them.

, When the cashier has rung through your last item, hand over any points cards you have that apply to that grocery store. This could include loyalty cards for that grocery store or other points you collect.


Tell the cashier how you intend to pay. This could include with cash, with a debit card, or with a credit card. Give the cashier enough to cover the bill if you're paying with cash, and don’t forget your change. Otherwise, complete the transaction on the machine.

, If you're using a cart, you can place the full grocery bags back in the cart to get them to your vehicle. When you’ve paid, take your receipt and leave the store via the exit.


Place your groceries into your car if you have one, or find an out-of-the-way spot where you can pull over and put your groceries into your wheeling cart or backpack.
When you're done, return the cart to one of the outdoor cart corrals located in the parking lot.

Measure the saffron threads.,
Crush the threads.,
Add to your dish.",How to Prepare Saffron1," Your recipe will usually tell you how much saffron to use, but there are some general rules that are good to know. Saffron is usually measured in grams, the number of threads, or “pinches.” A “pinch” typically means 20 medium-sized threads of saffron. Use a food scale or count the threads to measure out the saffron.Adding too much saffron can ruin a dish, so it’s best to err on the side of too little. You can always add more if the taste and color isn’t to your satisfaction.
Counting the saffron threads usually offers the most accurate measurement.
If you’re adding saffron on your own, the rule of thumb is usually to add three strands for each person that you’re serving. Three strands is approximately a ½ teaspoon.;
, For saffron to really shine in your dish, you need to ensure that its flavor and color are released. The quickest way to do that is to break down the threads. Saffron threads are very delicate, so it’s easy to crush them with your hand. Use your thumb and forefinger to gently grind the threads into pieces. However, if you prefer a more uniform look to the pieces of saffron in your recipe, use a mortar and pestle to crush the threads.Crushing saffron for use in recipes typically works best if you’re making a recipe that already has water or another cooking liquid in it, such as risotto or paella.
Keep in mind that crushing saffron by hand or with a mortar and pestle doesn’t offer the most attractive appearance because the threads are no longer in tact. However, you can still get a strong flavor, aroma, and color from crushed saffron.

, Once you’ve crushed the saffron threads, simply mix them into your recipe. It’s best to add crushed saffron as early on in the cooking process as possible. That way, there’s enough time for its flavor to infuse the other ingredients and its color to deepen the recipe.Make sure that there’s already some type of liquid in your pot or pan before mixing in the crushed saffron threads.

Buy your parsley.,
Keep your parsley fresh.,
Prepare for washing.,
Swish the parsley around in the bowl with your hands.,
Chop, cut, or rip the parsley.",How to Prepare Parsley," Parsley is normally sold as a bunch. It is best to buy fresh parsley rather than dried parsley. When buying it, make sure that the leaves are fresh and bright green and don't look wilted or yellow.

, When not dried, it should be kept in a plastic bag and sprinkled with water when it appears wilted. It could also be stood upright in a jar with a little water, as long as you clipped the ends.

, Washing parsley is very similar to washing spinach. For this, you need to fill a bowl with cold water and place the parsley in it.
, Repeat this process with clean water until the water no longer gets dirty after washing the parsley.

, You can use a knife or kitchen scissors.

When using a knife, hold the tip of the knife down with your non-dominant hand. Then move your dominant hand up and down the leaves until the desired consistency is achieved.
When using kitchen scissors, put the parsley in a bowl and keep on snipping with the scissors until it is chopped to the desired consistency.
You can also rip the parsley, instead of cutting it.

Take note of which type of herb is called for in the recipe.,
Familiarize yourself with the general rule for converting volume measurements.,
Adjust the amount needed depending on the age of your dried herbs.,
Add the herbs to your dish.",How to Measure Fresh vs Dried Herbs," If the recipe calls for fresh or dried herbs, and you have the correct amount, the dish will generally taste best if you don't swap 1 type for the other. If you don't have the right type of herb, make a note of the volume indicated.;
, It is quite straightforward to convert between dried and fresh herb measurements. The rule is: 1 part dried herb is equal to 3 parts fresh herbs. For example, a recipe that calls for a tablespoon (15 ml) of fresh oregano could be prepared using only a teaspoon (5 ml) of dried oregano. A recipe calling for 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) of dried basil could be prepared using 1.5 teaspoons (7.5 ml) of fresh basil.


The reason for this conversion is that dried herbs have a much lower water content, and therefore have a much higher concentration of essential oils. These oils lead to a more pronounced flavor in a smaller volume of herbs.
This conversion works for volume measurements only. Weight conversions will differ from herb to herb; herbs are rarely measured by weight, however.

, The rule above is not immutable; it should be used only as a general guideline. As dried herbs age in your pantry, they gradually lose their flavor (and color). If your herbs have just been purchased and still have a vibrant color and strong scent, then you should use a little less of them than dictated by the conversion rule. If the herbs have become a bit stale, use a little more to compensate.

, Once you have measured the appropriate amount and adjusted for their age, add the herbs to your dish. Note that the flavor will not be exactly the same between fresh and dried herbs.

Heat a liquid of your choice.,
Soak the saffron threads.,
Mix the liquid into your dish.",How to Prepare Saffron2," If you’re making a recipe that calls for some type of liquid, such as chicken stock, milk, or white wine, pour enough of the liquid to cover the amount of saffron that you’re using into a pan or pot. Next, heat the liquid on the stove until it’s hot. Be careful not to bring it to a boil, though.If your dish doesn’t necessarily call for liquid, you can use plain water.

, The most effective way to draw the flavor and color out of saffron is to submerge them in a hot liquid, so you want to soak them thoroughly before adding them to your recipe. In most cases, letting it sit in the liquid for 10 to 20 minutes is enough to prepare the saffron.Soaking the saffron before adding it to your recipe is the best way to ensure that it’s distributed evenly throughout the dish.
You can usually tell that your saffron has soaked long enough when the liquid starts to give off a strong aroma.
You can crush the threads by hand or with a mortar and pestle before soaking them, but using the whole strands can add an attractive look to your dish.
If you really want a robust flavor and color from your saffron, try soak the threads in room temperature water overnight. Then you can add them to warm chicken stock, milk, wine, or another liquid before adding them to your dish.

, When it comes time to add the saffron to your recipe, you don’t just want to remove the threads from the liquid and mix them in. Instead, add all of the liquid, so you get a deeper, richer flavor that pervades the entire dish. Typically, the best time to add the saffron liquid is near the end of cooking, but follow the instructions in your recipe.You can strain the threads and add only the liquid to your dish if you prefer, but that’s usually only necessary if you’re making a recipe that should have a clear appearance, such as a jelly.
If you plan to leave the threads in your recipe, there's no need to cut or chop them. The intact threads can add texture and visual interest to your dish.

Avoid powdered saffron.,
Look for a deep color.,
Pay attention to the texture.",How to Prepare Saffron3," Powdered or ground saffron may be cheaper than saffron threads, but there’s a good reason for that. It doesn’t have the same flavor, aroma, and color as fresh saffron, so it doesn’t provide the same rich taste and appearance. In fact, powdered saffron often contains paprika, turmeric, and bark from inferior saffron threads., Saffron threads should have a deep red color with orange tips. If you notice that the threads don’t have orange near the ends, it can be a sign of inferior saffron that’s been dyed to have a richer color.Make sure that the color is uniform too -- lighter streaks throughout the threads can be a sign of poor quality.In general, the deeper the color that saffron has, the higher quality it is.

, High quality saffron threads are typically fine and uniform in size. One end usually has a trumpet-like shape, while other has a thin, tendril-like appearance. If you notice that the saffron is irregularly shaped, features shreds instead of strands, or contains bark, it’s probably inferior quality.If the threads have a frayed, almost worn appearance, that can also be an indication that the saffron is poor quality.

Trim the ginger.,
Use a spoon.,
Use a peeler.,
Use a knife.,
Cut the ginger into “coins”.,
Cut the ginger into strips.,
Crush the ginger and then mince it.,
Use a microplane or grater to mince the ginger.,
Use a food processor.,
Use a nutribullet or small blender.",How to Mince Ginger," Usually ginger comes in a big piece with branches attached at odd angles. Depending on the amount of ginger that you need, you may want to take a piece from the larger part of the root, or you may just want a couple of small branches.


If you are using all of the root, trim the branches, so that you can peel them separately. If a few bits of ginger skin don’t bother you, don’t trim the branches. They will not get in the way of mincing the ginger.;
, Using a spoon is the method of peeling ginger preferred by most chefs.Using a spoon allows you to remove the paper-thin skin of the ginger, without losing too much of the meat.


Use a spoon with a very thin edge.Anchor the ginger on the cutting board on its flat side (if the bottom of the ginger is bumpy, just slice it off so that you have something flat to anchor with). Then use a brisk snapping motion to tear off the ginger skin with the side of the spoon.

, This method will remove some of the meat of the ginger, but not as much as using a knife. Hold the ginger at the bottom, and push the peeler across the ginger, away from you.


Use a big bowl to catch flying peels, or peel over your sink.

, You will lose a lot of ginger using this method, but if you are in a rush, it will do. A small knife, such as a paring knife is best.


Hold the ginger in your non-dominant hand, and use the paring knife to peel as you would an apple. Push the blade beneath the skin, and place your thumb on top of the hidden blade. Push the blade toward and past your thumb, with your thumb following the blade down the length of the ginger. Use your other hand to guide the direction of the cuts.

, First cut along the peeled ginger so that you get “coins”, or roundish pieces. Stack these coins one or two high, then cut them into thin strips, or “matchsticks”. Then cut perpendicular to your matchstick lines, cutting them into tiny cubes.


Chop over these cubes at random a few times if you want even smaller pieces.

, Some people prefer to cut strips along the length of the ginger, rather than “coins”.You can then cut these longer pieces into matchsticks and cubes.


This method is better if you don't mind having larger pieces of ginger in your cooking.

, This method works best with a big heavy knife, like a cleaver, but a large, flat-bladed knife will also do.


Cut the ginger into thick coins. Using the flat of the blade, crush the coins. They should “shatter”, leaving small pieces that are easy to mince quickly. If your knife is not heavy enough, you can place the flat of the blade on the ginger coin, and then hit it hard with your fist or palm.

, A microplane is like a very fine grater, and is often used for zesting. However, if you don’t have a microplane, a grater will work just as well. This method often produces a lot of ginger juice, so you will want to make sure to do it over a bowl or plate.


Scrape the peeled ginger over the microplane or grater, occasionally collecting the pulp that collects on top and adding it to the pile. This may take awhile, but in the end you have very fine pieces of ginger that are almost like pulp, and impossible to find in your final dish.

, Food processors are generally better for a large amount of ginger-- too little ginger, and most of it will get stuck under the blade. Use a food processor when you want to mince an entire root.


If you don’t need an entire root, but still want to use the food processor, ginger freezes quite well when wrapped in plastic. If you are cooking with frozen ginger, you don’t even need to thaw it-- the frozen water evaporates very quickly, leaving you with usable ginger.

, If you are making a dressing or marinade, you can use a strong blender to mince your ginger. Many blenders require liquid to keep from stalling the motor, so only use this method if you are making something liquid with your ginger.


Loosely chop the ginger before putting it in the blender with other liquids. Be sure to blend completely. Remove the blender from the base and checking for large pieces with a fork to make sure you don’t get chunks.

Freeze batches of fried onion.,
Prepare ground beef.,Freeze breadcrumbs and egg whites

,
Freeze leftover breadcrumbs, simply pop them in a freezer container, mark them and freeze them.,
Freeze egg whites.,
Freeze batches of a basic Bechamel Sauce Recipe.,
Double up your recipes.,
Organize your freezer.,
Organize your freezer labels, pens etc.

,
Organize your storage containers.,
Take charge of your freezer!",How to Implement Freezer Cooking and Organzing Tips," When you have a chance, chop a whole load of onions. Pour a little oil into a large pot and fry the onions until they soften and take on a deep caramel color. You may find it easier to do this in two pots. Cool the onions and then transfer equal quantities to freezer containers. I would transfer the equivalent of one to two onions to each container. Label each container and then freeze.;
, Now you are able to have some fun. You want to make one of those best ground beef recipes? No problem. You are already halfway there. Whilst your meat is browning, simply defrost the onions and then add them along with the other ingredients. You have the beginning of Chili con carne, a Beef and Noodle Casserole or a Ground Beef Goulash.

,, Next time you want to whiz up meatballs or crumb a piece of fish, the work has been done for you already.

, They freeze very well for a couple of months. Put the leftover egg whites into a container and mark HOW MANY THERE ARE i.e. ""3 egg whites."" Next time you feel inspired to whip up meringues or need egg white for an icing recipe, all you have to do is defrost them on low in the microwave and you're set.

, Make a large batch of your favorite Bechamel Sauce Recipe. I often do triple the usual quantity. Again, decant into freezer containers and mark. You now have the basis for a whole range of dishes, from your best baked macaroni cheese recipe to baked fish in a sauce. You can add simple ingredients to make a pasta sauce or you could add the Bechamel sauce to a Lasagna or Moussaka. But the key thing is, that part of the work has already been done, thereby making it completely viable to have a nutritious meal on the table in a relatively quick time.

, Double up when cooking food. This almost seems obvious but it is worth being reminded. If you are going to make one batch of your favorite Beef Curry Recipe, make two - one for now, and one for the freezer. Apply the same rule to any stews, simple ground beef recipes and even chicken casseroles. Most of these dishes are good natured and will freeze well.

, Try to be disciplined as to how you pack your freezer. Try to put ready-made meals on the same shelf or in the same drawer. Similarly, frozen raw ingredients should go together. Put ""little bits"" together - egg whites, chopped frozen fresh herbs, leftover sauces and so on. A particularly helpful shelf in our freezer is the LUNCH BOX shelf. In this drawer there are all makings for healthy lunchboxes. There is leftover chicken, frozen in between layers of waxed paper. There are cooked burgers or ham. There are wraps, croissants, or muffins. This means that when we make lunchboxes at night it is easy for the whole family to get involved and home in on the correct drawer. It seems to simplify things and is certainly cheaper than take-out food.

,, Have a set place in your kitchen where you keep your freezer containers. Stack them logically according to size and use. Nearby, have a drawer that keeps your freezer labels, marking pens, plastic bags, waxed paper and freezer tags. This means that that it not an onerous task popping a label onto your container and you will never wonder what that mysterious frozen lump in the freezer is again!

, Producing easy healthy recipes will suddenly become a pleasure. With a little bit of thought and simple meal planning, you can save time, money and your sanity!

Look for plump pieces of ginger root.,
Find firm, unblemished pieces of ginger root.,
Choose ginger root that smells sharp and strong.,
Cut off the appropriate amount of ginger.,
Use a metal spoon to gently scrape away the skin.,
Alternatively, use a vegetable peeler or a small paring knife.,
Don't peel the ginger root at all.,
Review any recipes you might be following.,
Chop or mince ginger if you want texture as well as flavor.,
Grate ginger when you want to add a strong aroma and fresh flavor to your food.,
Use the ginger in a variety of recipes.,
Store ginger in the refrigerator.,
Keep ginger fresh in the freezer.",How to Prepare Ginger Root For Cooking," Look for large pieces of ginger that are moist and heavy for their size. This will give you more ginger to work with.


Also look for pieces of ginger root that are straight and rectangular in shape, with as few bumps and knobs as possible. This will make them easier to peel and prepare.
Ginger root can be frozen, unpeeled, for up to 6 months, so do not be afraid to buy more than you need for your current recipe.;
, The skin of the ginger root should be firm and unblemished, apart from the rough, dried patch where the piece was cut. You do not want to buy anything that is wrinkled, soft or covered in mold.

, Quality ginger will smell peppery or have a slight aroma of citrus. If it's fresh, it should smell pungent and sharp.

, If you're following a particular recipe, use the amount of ginger indicated in the instructions - it is usually quantified in inches, rather than weight or volume.


Sometimes recipes will call for a ""thumb's worth"" of ginger, which is exactly what it sounds like: a piece of ginger root the length of your thumb!If you're not following a specific recipe, keep in mind that a little bit of ginger goes a long way, so start with a small piece, do a taste test, then add more if you need it.

, A spoon is the best way to remove the skin from the ginger root as it is quick, easy and avoids wasting any ginger.


Holding the ginger in one hand and the spoon in the other, use the inside top of the spoon to make firm, downwards strokes along the piece of ginger.
Dig the spoon over the little nubs that are often found on ginger root. The skin should come off with a gentle scrape, leaving everything else behind.

, If you're having trouble with the spoon, you can use a vegetable peeler or small paring knife instead.


This is perhaps a quicker method of peeling the ginger, but the benefit of using a spoon is that is preserves more of the ginger.
A vegetable peeler or knife will take off extra layers of ginger with the skin, so only use if you are very dexterous!

, For many dishes, it's not absolutely necessary to peel the ginger root, especially when you're using younger, fresher, thin-skinned ginger.


All you have to do is chop or grate the ginger with the skin still on (though you may want to cut off the dried piece at the end) and continue with your recipe.
However, if you are concerned that ginger skin might interfere with the look or texture of your dish, go ahead and peel it off.

, A soup may call for grated ginger while a stir fry recipe might tell you to chop it into matchsticks.


Remember that ginger loses its flavor the longer it cooks. So if you really want to take advantage of its taste and smell, add it to your food towards the end of your cooking time. This will preserve its freshness.

, When chopped into matchsticks, ginger is crispy and chewy.


Small pieces of minced ginger in a pasta or rice will provide bursts of flavor in every bite. Larger pieces are great in soups and teas.
To chop the ginger, place the root on its side and make thin, coin-shaped slices. Then, stack several coins together and make a number of vertical slices, to make matchsticks.
Mince the ginger by turning the matchsticks to the side and cutting across them, to form fine cubes. If you like, you can run your knife through the ginger a final time to get rid of any larger lumps., Grating your ginger is quick and easy way to get superfine or even pureed ginger, which makes an excellent addition to tomato sauces or marinades.


To grate, rub the piece of ginger against a microplane or a cheese grater. This will produce juicy grated ginger that looks and feels like a paste. You may want to grate the ginger over a bowl, to catch any juice.
Be careful when you get to the end of the ginger, as it can be easy to cut your fingers on the grater. You may need to use a knife to scrape off any ginger that's stuck to the grater.

, Ginger is such a versatile flavor, it is used across a broad array of recipes, from from stir fries and soups to breads and teas. If you're looking for some new ideas on how to use ginger, why not try one of the recipes listed below?


Make Ginger Tea
Make Candied Ginger
Make Ginger Snaps
Make Ginger Ale
Make Chicken with Ginger and Spring Onion
Make Ginger Chutney
Make Ginger Garlic Soup

, To store ginger in the refrigerator, wrap the ginger root in paper towel, then in plastic and place in the crisper. It should keep for approximately two weeks.

, To store ginger in the freezer, tightly wrap the root in plastic (you can peel it first if you like) and keep it there for up to six months. When you need to use the ginger, you can grate it while it's still frozen. In fact, ginger is easier to work with while frozen as it is less fibrous.

Start by taking a survey of the people you're having over for dinner.,
The most popular types of dinner parties are holiday parties.,
If this is your first time having a big dinner party, it is a good idea to keep the amount of people you are having over for dinner at a low level.,
Be aware that if you have invited children of any age, they may not act as mannerly as adults do.,
Some little babies and toddlers might end up coming to your dinner party too.,
Clean your house well.,
Buy the food or ingredients.,
If you are not good at cooking, you can try hiring a chef or a good cook to do the cooking for you.,
Add side dishes to the dinner such as bread, corn, rice, peas, any vegetable or salad.,
Cook a delicious meal that has a good taste and that is very common to most people.,
Set the table with your best tablecloth and set the table nicely.,
Be as polite as you can be.,
Serve assorted drinks such as wine, water, milk, beer, tea, or iced tea.,
Put condiments such as salt, pepper, butter, etc.,
Make a special dessert.",How to Make a Fabulous Dinner," Ask about their favorite food. You can call them up a week or so before and ask if they have any dietary issues or concerns that you need to allow for. Note these down very carefully. Ask them if you are unsure of where to purchase unusual ingredients if they do require something unique. Also, if you feel that your guests might not like what you had in mind, try cooking something that you like, and what some of the people you invited like.;
, The main holidays that people have big feasts on are: Thanksgiving, Christmas, and in the Jewish Religion, Passover and Hanukkah. These are very big holidays to some people and the stores are usually crowded during these times. Step #7 tells you that you can place food orders in advance so you have time to get the food before your big party.

, A good amount of people to invite over would be 2-4 people. If you are more experienced with this type of thing, you could try inviting over 4-6 people or even 8-10 people. This includes inviting over little children and/or teenagers. This may make even a low amount of guests hard to handle.

, (This is true with most kids, especially kids 12 and under.) If you call up your guests a week or so earlier than the actual dinner, if they have kids and their kids are coming, remind them to tell their children to be on their best behavior. Expect for children get out of control at the dinner party (kids will be kids!). You could ask them to stop and make sure their parent/guardian takes care of them. But remember to be patient - it just makes it awkward if you are trying to parent others' children! If possible, if your guests have children 10 and up, you would have a better chance of watching them behave at the dinner party than younger kids.

, Ask the guardian of the babies about what they should have to eat and what they prefer sitting in. If your guest doesn't bring a bib for them, find and give them one yourself. This will help keep your tablecloth clean. Make sure to have their parent/guardian sitting next to them in case of an emergency or if the baby/toddler starts to cry. Also, remind the guardians of babies/toddlers to maybe just in case bring some extra diapers if the baby goes in his/her diaper. No one will want a stinky diaper near them while eating dinner!

, Scrub the floors and windows, polish special items, dust different rooms, burn scented candles to make rooms smell nice and vacuum the place. Prepare rooms that your guests will walk in, especially the bathrooms. Provide fresh rolls of toilet paper, clean hand towels and washcloths, and soaps. Freshen up the bathroom air with scented sprays, candles, or containers with potpourri in them.

, If you buy locally, you are assured of the freshest possible produce and good quality. You can also place orders in advance in case you are worried that the butcher, grocer, or produce department might not have what you need on the day of your dinner. Also look ahead into a recipe book or booklet for some ideas and inspirations.

, It may cost a lot of money, but you will be assured the food will be prepared pleasingly. You can also try to find the food you are making already boxed and ready to eat at the supermarket. If you are making things like salads, then you can try to find that specific food prepackaged at the supermarket. Check packages of prepared foods for storage and preparation instructions.

, Side dishes are important because they allow people to make up their own minds how much food will satisfy them for the evening, without having to look greedy or like they are refusing your cooking.

, Some good foods to consider are different types of meat, chicken, turkey and/or beef. You can also try making a nice pasta dish with or without red pasta sauce. You could also make spaghetti, lasagna, ravioli or a special kind of soup such as tomato, chicken noodle, or cream of mushroom soup.

, Always use your best linen, your best cutlery (polish it up if needed, as this can look awful if tarnished) and use your best dinner set. Make sure the seats are comfortable, and remember to put small round pads under the legs of the chairs.

, Put your napkin in your lap and don't burp. Say please and thank-you. Act excited about having guests over to your house. Also, do not swear or use any foul language, especially if you have invited children. One of the most important things to remember at the big meal is to always serve the next course when everyone has eaten what has satisfied them from the present course. Don't wait until the last minute to serve the next course, the guests may feel less entertained when no food is in front of them. You should serve them the next course without them having to ask for it.

, Avoid soda because soda can make you burp a lot in which is extremely rude. Try adding some ice into your water and a lemon into your tea and/or iced tea. Prepare the tea the way your guests like it if you are able make it their way.

, on the food or on the table. These sorts of food accompaniments should be available without guests having to ask for them. Other possibilities may be sauces, gravies, cheeses, or even ketchup.

, This is the time to try out that special recipe you have wanted to make for ages but didn't have a special occasion for. Splurge and make it rich, delicious and ""to die for"". A good dessert would be a scrumptious chocolate cake or brownies. Some fruit salad may be good with oranges, apples, bananas and/or strawberries. Try looking in a recipe book or asking someone for some other recipes you can try for dessert.

Try wikiHow's article on the different methods of artichoke preparing to see if one strikes your fancy.



Grilled artichokes? Yes, please. Risotto with Artichokes? Definitely worth a try. Have you tried artichokes with a lemon aioli or even barbecued? There's lots to experiment with when it comes to this veggie.;
, Chives and tarragon are good, too.Use these herbs and spices to flavor your butter and then give your asparagus a nice herbed sauté.


You can steam asparagus, roast asparagus, blanch asparagus...the list goes on. But a tried and true recipe favorite? Bacon-wrapped asparagus. Mmm.

, The veggie you don't appreciate until you reach adulthood. This versatile veggie goes well with tons of herbs and spices and can be made spicy and savory or creamy and cheesy. With this one, it's pretty hard to go wrong.


Broccoli is a great veggie for almost any diet. If you're watching your calories, try it steamed. Watching your carbs? Even broccoli cheese soup is low in carbohydrates. And in almost any recipe, broccoli will gladly welcome whatever spice you choose.

, Brussels sprouts certainly get a bad rap, but prepared the right way will make you wonder why you spent years avoiding them. Use these herbs and spices to lessen the strong taste of this veggie.


Have you ever tried Brussels sprouts with maple syrup? Delicious. But if you're looking for a more basic recipe, you can boil, saute, roast, or braise them with some herbs and that should do the trick.

, Sometimes cabbage needs a bit of help – and if you do it right, it can transform this veggie into a memorable dish. Herbs are a must with cabbage – the above ones are great, but you could also keep it simple with just a bit of pepper and butter. Bacon never hurts either.This is especially helpful for the cabbage soup diet. It gets pretty boring, so you'll need herbs and spices to gladly come to the rescue in this situation.

, Or if you're looking to go a little more exotic, they can also pair with coconut and curry, cinnamon and nutmeg, or ginger.


You knew you could make carrot soup and make carrot cake, but did you know you could make carrot pancakes? And if you're not looking to bust out the slow cooker or your baking skills, a simple roasted carrot dish goes nicely with just about any meal.

With a little olive oil, it does well with thyme, tarragon, and parsley, too.There's hardly a spice you could go wrong with when it comes to this versatile veggie.


Cauliflower is a savior for those avoiding starchy vegetables and carbohydrates. You can make mashed cauliflower that tastes just like potatoes, make cheesy cauliflower breadsticks, and even cauliflower gratin.

, Zucchini (or courgette) is a very basic vegetable that only needs very basic spices. It's similar to cauliflower in that it can be used in many different ways and as a substitute for other, less healthy ingredients. Here are a few ideas to challenge your zucchini skills:

, Also known as aubergine, this vegetable is great when it's given a little kick, like with garlic, curry, or soy sauce. Baked, fried, or grilled, it's all good.


Why not do ""Meatless Mondays"" and make a vegetarian eggplant lasagna for dinner? If that doesn't sound up your alley, try stuffed eggplant, eggplant parmigiana, or eggplant fritters.

, Green beans are cheap, easy to prepare, healthy, and filling. What's not to like? And to top it off, they don't need too many herbs and spices to be delicious. Just sprinkle on the aforementioned flavors and your job is practically done. Here are some ideas to try:

, Leeks are sort of onion-y in flavor, and are sometimes even used as a substitute. If you have a favorite onion recipe or favorite herbs to pair with onions, try pairing the same ones with leeks.Just some butter and garlic works well, too (throw in some ginger if you're feeling crazy).


Leeks are considered a ""gourmet onion."" wikiHow has a great article on different ways to prepare leeks, in addition to great recipes on potato leek soup and vegan leek quiche.

, Lettuce is a staple of practically any kind of diet. Since it's so watery and simple, it can easily be overpowered, so be careful. Just a dash of your chosen herbs will do.



Lettuce wraps are a great idea to avoid starchy breads, and a simple lettuce salad is a nice complement to virtually any dish. Feeling frisky? How about a peanut butter, lettuce, and cheese sandwich?

, Mushrooms – a topping, a flavor, or even an entire dish. Mushrooms themselves have a good flavor, but then can be emphasized even more with the right spices and herbs. They're easily made spicy and tangy, or can be toned down for a more savory touch. They too can take on just about anything, so feel free to experiment.


Kick the ground beef habit and try a portobello mushroom sandwich. With your mushroom sandwich, how about a side of garlic mushrooms or stuffed mushrooms? Surprisingly, they'll all have different flavors.

, You can throw onion in to just about any recipe – curries, stir fries, sandwiches, salads, soups – you name it, it could probably do for an onion. Take into account the flavor of the dish before you season the onions; since onions can take on a variety of flavors, you want one that matches the specific dish you're creating.


The simplest thing you can do with a new supply of onions is to grill them. But you could also make onion dip, onion rings, or even try your hand at onion soup.

, Peas are great as an add-in just like onions (and are good in just about as many things) or great on their own, especially when cooked in herbs and spices. They too don't need a lot of flavor to make them pungent, so add your flavors little by little until you reach your desired outcome.


This is a good time to try making split pea soup. You could also spice up your recipe book with potato and pea samosas.

, It's hard to mess up a potato. They're good on their own, and they're good with a number of spices, too. Try tossing the herbs in a bit of olive oil and using it to roast your potatoes.And if you're feeling super indulgent, don't forget the cheese and butter!


The number of things you can do with potatoes is practically endless. However, here are just a few wikiHow favorites: Make Simple Mashed Potatoes, Make Potato Wedges, Make Roast Potatoes, Make Potato Latkes, and Make Saffron Potatoes.

, You can also use these guidelines for spinach, too. This healthy veggie is growing in popularity and pairs nicely with anchovies, beef, butter, chicken, garlic, lemons and olives.For dinner tomorrow, try making pasta with Swiss chard and mushrooms. You could also try experimenting with wikiHow's spinach dip and spinach pie recipes and working in silver beets.
Silver beets, or Swiss chard, has about a dozen names (perpetual spinach, spinach beet, crab beet, bright lights, sea kale beet, etc.) If you see something that looks like silver beet or Swiss chard but it's labeled something else, it's probably just a regional term.

, Tomatoes are another great staple to many diets. They're versatile and healthy and with the right spices, can add a definite kick of flavor to any meal. And if they're grown in your garden, eating them is even more rewarding.


You know pizza and pasta, but have you ever made your own with fresh tomato sauce? It can make all the difference. The same goes for tomato soup, too. When it's fresh and homemade, it's infinitely better.

However, if you’re planning on exclusively using your oil for beauty purposes, you can use jojoba oil or sweet almond oil.Jojoba oil and sweet almond oil should not be eaten or used in cooking.

, Add the rosemary sprigs to the saucepan. Place the pan over low heat on your stove. Heat the rosemary for five to ten minutes, stirring constantly.As the oil warms up, it will begin to smell like rosemary.


If the oil begins bubbling around the rosemary, the oil is too hot. Reduce the heat and stir.

, Place a metal colander in a large metal bowl. Pour the oil mixture into the colander to strain out the rosemary pieces. Discard the leftover pieces of rosemary and let the oil cool in the bowl. Metal strainers and cheesecloths can also be used to strain the oil. Make sure the oil has cooled before using these tools.

, Once the oil has cooled to room temperature, it can be poured into a clean bottle. Label the bottle with the bottling date and the ingredients used. However, resist the urge to add a sprig of rosemary to the bottle. It looks pretty, but it can cause harmful bacteria to grow in the oil., Oils infused with fresh herbs should be refrigerated and used within the week.This will prevent the growth of any harmful bacteria that could cause the oil to become rancid.

",How to Clean Clams,"









Clams may have already been cleaned; however, it may not be as thorough a job as you might expect. Give the batch a once-over to determine whether or not you will be purchasing any.
Some clams will be closed, while others may be slightly open. Tap on them to see if they automatically close. If they respond, they are alive. Do not choose any wide open clams, as they are more than likely dead.;
,,









Shells that are broken may mean the clam is dead or unhealthy. Discard these.
Make sure the clams are completely submerged under the water. As the clams are soaking they will naturally spit out any salt, sand and ocean particles they have absorbed, which will clean their insides.

,,









You can repeat this process a couple of times if you wish to ensure the clams are thoroughly cleaned.

Store the dried seasoning.",How to Make Poultry Seasoning1," Gather a small bowl, a storage jar or container for your poultry seasoning, a small whisk, and a set of measuring spoons. This traditional dried poultry seasoning recipe will make about 1/4 cup. Most recipes calling for poultry seasoning will only require a teaspoon or two, so you'll make more than you might need with this recipe.


If your spices are dried or lumpy, you may need to replace them with fresher spices. Taste and smell the spices. If they're still flavorful, you may just want to sift them.;
, Place all of your dried ingredients into the small bowl and use the whisk to thoroughly combine the seasoning. Once the spices are combined, your poultry seasoning is ready to store or use. You'll need to measure out and combine:1 tablespoon of dried ground sage
1 tablespoon of dried ground thyme
1 tablespoon of dried ground marjoram
1 teaspoon of dried ground rosemary
1 teaspoon of crushed celery seed
1 teaspoon of ground black pepper

, Poultry seasoning is famously rubbed on turkey before roasting it. You could also rub it on chicken or capons before roasting them. If using the traditional dried seasoning, drizzle a little olive oil over the meat and sprinkle 1 or 2 teaspoons of the dried seasoning over the poultry. Use your hands to evenly rub the seasoning across the entire turkey or chicken. Cook the poultry according to your specific recipe.


You may need more or less seasoning, depending on the size of your turkey or chicken.

, Cover the seasoning with a tight-fitting lid or transfer your dried seasoning to an airtight container. Spices and seasonings can last several years if stored away from heat and light. But you should still try to make poultry seasoning in small amounts so you use it quickly.


If you'd like your poultry seasoning to stay even fresher for longer, consider purchasing whole spices to grind yourself."

Smell the oil.,
Watch for how thick it is.,
Throw the oil away properly.,
Be safe.",How to Clean Dark Cooking Oil," When you fry foods, the foods leave pieces behind that cloud up the oil. Skimming the oil takes away some of these pieces, though you'll need to take further steps to remove all of them. Skimming the oil just takes care of the big pieces.Use a skimmer to get rid of any floating pieces of food that are on top of or inside the blackened oil in the pot. Throw them away. You can also use a skimmer to clean the oil while you're cooking.
You can buy oil skimmers at most big-box stores that have household items. Oil skimmers are pretty cheap. You can get one for about $12 or so, and you can also buy them online or at a restaurant supply store. They are a metal mesh net circle fastened to a handle.;
, After you use a skimmer to remove the larger pieces, you need to strain the oil next. Straining the oil removes the smaller bits of sediment, so your oil is less cloudy overall and you don't have bits of food left in it. You'll need a fine mesh strainer or cheese cloth for this process.Wait until the grease is cool to strain it.
Have a clean pot or bowl ready. Pour the grease through the fine mesh strainer. Make sure not to pour too fast and overflow the strainer. Also, if you see sediment in the bottom, don't pour the last of the oil in. Leave the sediment where it is, and toss it later.
If you don't have a strainer, try cheese cloth over a funnel.You can also try coffee filters.
If it's hard to pour, use a measuring cup or large ladle for the straining process by straining a little bit of the oil at a time.

, Once you've strained the oil, get the original container back out. Use a funnel to pour the oil back into it. The original container was designed to store the oil, so it's fine to use it again. Just make sure you don't pour hot oil into a plastic container.Only use the original container if you used all of the oil in it to deep fry. Otherwise, you'll be adding used oil to new oil.
Don’t place the cover on the container until the oil has completely cooled.

, It's not just cooking that breaks down oil. How you store it can also break it down. You need to keep the oil away from humidity, light, and heat to keep the oil in prime cooking condition.Light and heat will further degrade the oil as it sits in storage, increasing the chances you can’t reuse it.
Do not store the oil above the stove, where it will be subjected to secondary heat from other cooking.
Instead, store the oil in a cool and dark location. The refrigerator is a good choice if you have room. Oil in the refrigerator will be thicker and may look cloudy (white), but it will be fine once it comes to room temperature., Keep in mind that once cooking oil is used, it is going to harbor some of the smells of the food you last used in it. For example, cooking fish in oil will impart its flavor to the oil, so you only want to fry fish or other proteins in it, not something sweet.Keep your oils separate. If you used one for cooking fish, put it in its own bottle so you don't use it to cook something sweet.
Label each bottle of oil with what you cooked in it, as well as the date you bought it or last cooked with it.
Reusing used cooking oil can make a lot of sense financially if possible. For example, the peanut oil used to make one batch of French fries can cost as much as $10., Just because you used the oil for deep frying the first time doesn’t mean you have to use it for deep frying the second time after cleaning it. You can use it to cook in other ways, such as making a stir fry.You can also use the oil to bake. Remember, again, that the oil will retain some of the flavors and smells of the first food it was fried in, though, so always use it with similar flavors.

, The smoke point is the temperature where an oil starts to smoke, meaning it is breaking down more quickly. Picking an oil with a high or medium-high smoke point means it won't break down as much while it cooks.Sunflower, palm oil, and avocado oil all have high smoke points and are suitable for frying.
Peanut oil, canola oil, and grapeseed oil have medium-high smoke points and can also be used for frying.
Refined oils can be heated hotter than raw oils and are thus a better choice if you’re planning to reuse the oil. For example, more refined olive oil, such as refined or ""light"" olive oil, can be used for frying, while it's better to skip extra virgin olive oil for this purpose.

, One way to cut down on cloudiness in the oil is to pick foods that won't leave as much food behind in the oil. Any food left behind will make the oil cloudier and less usable.For example, using breaded foods leaves behind more pieces than using battered foods.
Foods just dredged in flour will leave even more food behind.

, In restaurants, oils tend to break down more slowly because of the way the heating element works. Basically, it has a cooler area at the bottom where food can fall and not burn. The only way to replicate the effect at home is to purchase an electric fryer.While an electric fryer is an investment, it can be a good one if you fry foods often. It can help you reuse your oil, as well as help you control the temperature of your oil.

, The oil will become quickly unusable if you overheat it. You don’t want to under heat it either, though, or it will take longer to cook the food and more debris from the food will fall off of it and into the oil. Make sure you are frying below the smoke point for your oil. If you don't know the smoke point, you can look it up online.Use a frying thermometer to keep an eye on the heat. Having a thermometer will also help you cook your food at the right temperatures, resulting in better flavor.
When you’re done cooking your food, turn off the heat. The longer you keep the heat on, the more likely the oil is to break down There comes a point where you can no longer use blackened oil at all, so keeping the oil the proper temperature will increase the chances you can clean and reuse it.
Most oils with a medium-high to high smoke point can take temperatures up to at least 400 degrees Fahrenheit, though some can take even higher temperatures. For example, avocado oil has a smoke point of 520 degrees Fahrenheit., Sometimes, you need to throw in the towel and replace the oil. There’s no clear rule on how many times you can reuse oil. However, you do have signs you should look for of when to toss the oil. If it's dark even after you filter it, it's time to throw it out. If it has a foam on the top, it's also time to throw it out.Eventually, the oil will break down, and it will start making your food greasy instead of crispy it because it will seep into the food too quickly.
When it foams, it will smoke too soon for frying, meaning you won't be able to fry the food at the right temperature.

, Old oil goes rancid, which smells bad. When you pull your oil out for frying, smell it first. If it doesn't smell right, it's time to toss it. You don't want to use an oil that will ruin a batch of food by making it taste awful.Rancid oil usually won't hurt you. However, the flavor is pretty bad.Cooking oil that has gone rancid will have a musty smell that smells somewhat like fish or a bad fast-food restaurant in addition to being dirty looking.

, When you first get oil, it should pour smoothly, with the exception of oils that are solid at room temperature, such as coconut oil. However, as oil breaks down, it will get a lot thicker. If the oil is looking thick or sticky, it's time to toss it.However, remember that putting it in the refrigerator will also make it thick. Let the oil come to room temperature before checking it for thickness.

, Once you figure out you need to throw your oil away, you should do it properly. For instance, it’s a terrible idea to dump grease down the drain, as it clogs pipes not only at your house, but in the rest of the city. So don’t get rid of oil that way once it’s time to discard it.The best way to deal with oil is to put it in a container that you are planning to throw away anyway. Just don't put in plastic while it's hot.
Even with hot water applied, the oil will get stuck in pipes and necessitate calling a plumber. In fact, tossing oil (fat and grease as well) down the kitchen drain is the leading cause of sewer backups. The oil clogs pipes over time and could cost you thousands of dollars in repairs.Never put your cooking oil into a storm drain as that can impact the environment, including fish and wildlife. Even with hot water and detergent you won’t be able to get all of the oil down the drain.
Some local disposal centers might accept used cooking oil if you don’t want to put it in the trash for environmental reasons. Check with local government about whether you community recycles used cooking oil.

, Using cooking oil when deep frying can be dangerous because temperatures can exceed 400 degrees Fahrenheit. Be careful not to burn yourself and to not get too close to the oil while it's frying. Use a frying screen to block flying oil when you're not turning the food.Oil is very flammable, making it easy to start a fire, especially if you're working near an open flame like a gas burner. It’s a good idea to have a kitchen fire extinguisher nearby when working with cooking oil. Water turns into hot steam when it hits very hot oil. Water can cause oil to splatter and injure you, so don’t let water get into the hot fat.
If you have a grease fire, don’t use water to put it out. The oil will just spread and splatter further. Cover the fryer with a metal lid if you don’t have a kitchen fire extinguisher, and call 911 immediately.
Keep any pots with hot oil on the back burner if you have kids in the house. That way, they can't come up and stick a hand in the pot or turn the pot over.
Read the owner’s manual before using a deep fryer. Don’t add oil to the deep fryer unless it’s turned off, has been wiped dry, and is away from water.

This fresh herb poultry seasoning will make around 3/4 of a cup.


Since the flavor of fresh herbs isn't as concentrated as in dried herbs, you'll need to use more of the fresh seasoning than you would of dried poultry seasoning.

, Rinse the herbs and remove the stems since they can be woody or tough. Place them on a cutting board. Carefully chop the fresh herbs using a sharp knife until they are fine. You'll need to chop:


3 tablespoons of thyme
3 tablespoons of rosemary
3 tablespoons of sage
1 tablespoons of marjoram

, Place the fresh herbs in the small bowl along with the other spices. Use the spoon or whisk to combine the seasoning. Your seasoning is now ready to store or use. You'll need to combine the fresh chopped herbs with:1⁄2 tablespoon of freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon of celery seed
1 teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg
1 teaspoon of ground ginger
1 teaspoon of smoked paprika

, Cover the seasoning with a tight-fitting lid or transfer your fresh herb seasoning to an airtight container. Since the herbs are fresh, you'll need to use them quickly or they'll begin to lose their flavor. Try to use this seasoning as soon as you make it.If you need to make the seasoning ahead of time, you can refrigerate it up to 3 days.

, Drizzle a turkey or large chicken with a tablespoon of olive oil. Apply all of the fresh herb seasoning and rub it all over the meat using your hands. You should have a heavy coating of the seasoning evenly distributed across the poultry. Cook the turkey or chicken according to your specific recipe.


You'll need to use all of the seasoning since fresh herbs aren't as concentrated in flavor as dried herbs.
You can also use the seasoning when cooking individual pieces of poultry.

Season your soups and casseroles.,
Make stuffing.,
Use poultry seasoning for marinades and sauces.",How to Make Poultry Seasoning3," If you find yourself always reaching for plain salt and pepper to seasoning your soups or casseroles, spice things up by using poultry seasoning. Place the poultry seasoning in a spice jar so you can shake just a little into whatever you're cooking. Taste the food and continue to add the seasoning until you've gotten the flavor you're looking for.


Poultry seasoning works especially well if you're using something that already has a base of chicken stock or chicken broth.

, Stuffing is another popular dish that relies heavily on poultry seasoning. Follow your recipe's instructions for using a dried or fresh poultry seasoning. Since many stuffing recipes contain raw egg, it can be difficult to taste the stuffing and adjust seasonings before cooking. Instead, get close to the stuffing and take a deep breath. If you can't smell the poultry seasoning, add more.


Stuffing can be flavorless and boring if you don't have enough poultry seasoning to give it flavor.

, If you're marinating any chicken or poultry dish, add a few shakes of poultry seasoning. It will help to bring out any flavors you've already added to the meat. You can also season marinades or sauces for barbecued chicken.


Many barbecued chicken marinades rely on a mixture of poultry seasoning, vinegar, oil, egg, and salt and pepper."

, Chicken fat has a lower smoke point than beef fat and ghee, but it is still relatively high (375 degrees Fahrenheit/190 degrees Celsius). Therefore, use it for sautéing, pan frying, stir-frying, and medium to high-heating cooking. Chicken fat also has great flavor. Therefore, use it in dishes that you would like to give a boost of flavor to like vegetable dishes and soups.You can use chicken fat as a substitute for butter in roux.
Try making chicken pot pie with chicken fat.

, Because butter has a relatively low smoke point (350 degrees Fahrenheit/175 degrees Celsius), you do not want to use it for high-heat cooking like frying and searing. However, butter is great for baking and sautéing, and for making roux and soups.Instead of using butter to sear meats like steak and chicken, baste the meats in butter just before they finish cooking.

, Lard is a versatile fat that can be used for frying, searing, sautéing, pan frying, and stir-frying.Contrary to popular belief, lard does not have a strong pork flavor, it has a neutral flavor. Therefore, lard can be used to make baked goods, pastries and pie crusts. It can also be used as a substitute for butter on toast and in roux.Lard's smoke point is 370 degrees Fahrenheit (185 degrees Celsius), so it can be used for medium to high-heating cooking.

Use an oil that can handle high heat when you are frying food.,
Bake with canola oil, palm oil or coconut oil for best results and flavor.

,
sauté food with almost any oil.,
Make dressings, marinades and dips with an oil that has a lot of flavor.,
Sample many different oils to see what you like best.,
Shop for oils at your grocery store or a specialty market.,
Consider the fat content.,
Use polyunsaturated oils when you do not need to heat them, or can heat them at very low temperatures.,
Read your recipe carefully to see if a specific oil is called for.",How to Choose the Right Cooking Oil," Such oils include peanut oil, palm oil, canola oil and avocado oil.


Look for a refined oil when frying. They are more stable and can handle higher temperature levels.;
,, Most popular oils to use for sautéing include olive oil, canola oil and sesame oil


Avoid getting the oil so hot that it smokes, when sautéing. It can create toxic fumes and create cancer-causing free radicals in the food you cook with oil that has exceeded its smoke point.

, Such oils include extra virgin olive oil, peanut oil or walnut oil.

, Dip a piece of bread in a small amount of oil to judge its taste and flavor.


Taste flavored oils that are new on the market. Some olive oil makers are adding flavors and seasonings to olive oil in order to create specialty oils such as chili pepper infused olive oil.

, Check online for websites that sell specific oils for cooking purposes.

, Oils are fats, but some oils are made up of better fats than others.


Use monounsaturated fats for heart health and to regulate cholesterol. Olive oil, peanut oil, avocado oil and sesame oil are examples of monounsaturated fats.
Avoid trans fats, which are chemically processed hydrogenated oils that are bad for your health. Check labels to make sure there are no trans fats in the oils you use.
Avoid saturated fats. Most animal origin and hydrogenated oils are high in saturated fats, which can lead to atherosclerosis (thickening or narrowing of arteries).

, These oils include walnut oil, soy and corn oil. They become unstable when heat is applied.

, Use that oil, or experiment with an oil that is similar.

Follow prepared food instructions.,
Arrange food for reheating.,
Cover food safely.,
Check food during cooking.",How to Choose Microwave Safe Containers," Some microwavable containers, especially those made of plastic, can be potentially harmful to your health. Others, like glass or plastic dishes, are better for your health.Informing yourself about the potential dangers of certain types of microwave-safe containers may help you make a safer choice.Some of the potential health hazards are:


”Endocrine disruption,” which mimics human hormones.This may have effects such as modifying chemical signals that regulate metabolism and reproduction.Miscarriage and birth defects
Lower sperm counts
Early puberty
Cancer
Obesity and diabetes
Neurobehavioral abnormalities.;
, “Plastic” is a generic term for different materials, or plasticizers, that can form microwave containers. In particular, it’s plastic containers with BPA, phthalates, polyvinyl chloride, and polycarbonate that may harm your health. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) closely regulates plastic containers and materials that come in contact with foods, you may still want to learn and avoid potentially hazardous chemicals.The following containers may be harmful if microwaved with food:


Plastic dishes
Some Styrofoam containers
Plastic storage or shopping bags
Plastic wrap
Takeout food containers, water bottles, and plastic tubs or jars that hold foods like margarine, yogurt, mayonnaise, or mustard.Soft plastic containers

, In many cases, containers are manufactured to be microwave-safe and may have labels on their packing and the products indicating this.In addition, you may want to make sure that the containers also bear other markers that can indicate they’re safe for microwave use and your health. Check packaging and the product for the following symbols or statements:


A label ”microwave-safe”A symbol of a dish with wave-like lines above it.A symbol of lines of waves.A symbol of a triangle, or Mobius loop, with a number in it. The number designates the type of plasticizer used in the product, which you may want to avoid., You may already have microwave- safe containers in your kitchen. Before purchasing new containers, look in your pantry to see what you have and can use.


Read containers for labels including “microwave-safe.”Be aware that there is no consensus on plastic wrap and microwaves. If you use plastic wrap in the microwave, make sure the packaging says “microwave-safe.”Check for containers that are old, scratched, cracked, or have been used frequently. These may leech out more harmful materials. Consider throwing these away and investing in new containers.Make sure glass or ceramic containers have the “microwave-safe” label and do not contain any materials, such as rims, made of gold or other materials not safe for the microwave.Be aware that, contrary to popular belief, you can microwave some Styrofoam or other polystyrene containers. Just make sure to check that they are labeled microwave-safe., Even if you need microwave-safe containers and want to buy new ones, it’s easy to find microwave-safe options at most retailers. Read package labeling and the product itself for descriptions and symbols that designate the product microwave-safe.Remember that glass and ceramic containers are the safest options for microwaving. Check to make sure that they also carry the “microwave-safe” designation.Just be aware that these products may be more expensive than plastic, though they may also last longer.
Buy plastic containers and wrap marked microwave-safe.
Consider checking the Good Housekeeping Institute’s test results for the best and safest containers to use in the microwave., There is a method you can use to check a container’s safety that you are unsure of or one that has a microwave-safe label. Running this safety test may help you decide if you want to use the container or opt for another one.Empty the container you want to test and place it inside the microwave.Put a second container containing one cup of tap water inside the microwave.Heat the microwave on high for one minute. If the empty container is cool, it’s safe to use in the microwave. If it is warm, use it only to reheat food and if it is hot, don’t use it in the microwave at all., Microwaves make many things in our lives easier. But they don’t come without potential hazards and it’s important to read the instruction manual for your microwave to avoid harming yourself or others.


Contact the microwave’s manufacturer if you have any questions.
Check online for product manuals if you lost your instruction packet.
See if there are specific suggestions on the type of containers or wrap you can use. For example, some microwaves can use specific types of aluminum foil, while others can’t.See if there are instructions or suggestions for specific foods. For example, most meats cannot be cooked at full power, but instead at half power for longer., If you want to cook prepared foods in your microwave, read the packaging instructions. In most cases, these containers can only be microwaved once and may also have specific heating requirements.Vent containers if required by puncturing them with a fork or peeling back a corner of the plastic wrap.Make sure you closely check the heating requirements. For example, some foods can only be cooked at 50% power and not following this could ruin your meal and your microwave.

, If you’re going to use a covered dish to reheat food, it’s arrangement in the container can affect the heating process. Arranging your food evenly within the container can help ensure uniform cooking and may help destroy harmful bacteria., In many cases, you may need to cover food you’ve prepared yourself to heat it in the microwave. Making sure you use safe types of covers and vent the container can ensure that you don’t cause unsafe chemicals to leech into your food.Choose plastic wrap that is labeled microwave-safe. However, never let it contact your food.Consider using waxed or kitchen parchment paper, white paper towels or plates, or a domed microwave container to cover your food.Loosen or vent the lid or any wrap to allow steam to escape.Stay away from brown paper bags, newspaper, foam containers, and most aluminum foil as covers., Midway through the microwaving process, check your food to make sure it is cooking properly. Consider rotating or stirring the food to eliminate cold spots.Be aware that cold spots in food can contain harmful bacteria.Use a food thermometer to check temperatures, especially of meat."

Use fats high in saturated fats.,
Choose monounsaturated fats.,
Avoid fats high in polyunsaturated fat when cooking.",How to Choose the Right Cooking Fat2," Fats high in saturated fats are great for cooking and frying at higher temperatures. Because of their molecular structure, cooking fats high in saturated fats are stable and will not break down or oxidize due to high temperatures.Fats derived from animals are usually high in saturated fats.

, Cooking fats that contain a higher percentage of monounsaturated fats are great for cooking at medium to high temperatures. These cooking fats are suitable for sautéing, stir-frying, pan frying, and medium to high-heat cooking.Like saturated fats, monounsaturated fats do not oxidize under high temperatures.

, Because of their molecular structure, polyunsaturated fats will oxidize under high to medium-heat temperatures. When they oxidize, they release chemicals called aldehydes and lipid peroxides. Inhaling or consuming these chemicals has been linked to negative health effects.Seed and vegetable oils, like soybean, corn, cottonseed, canola, sunflower, sesame, and grapeseed oil, contain high percentages of polyunsaturated fat.
It is best to eat these oils fresh or raw instead.

Look for fats with a high smoke point.,
Use fats with a medium smoke point.,
Avoid fats with a low smoke point.",How to Choose the Right Cooking Fat3," Do this when you are frying, searing or cooking at high temperatures. A high smoke point is defined as one that is above 400 degrees Fahrenheit (205 degrees Celsius).Some examples of cooking fats that have a high smoke point are beef fat, ghee, extra-light olive oil, almond oil, avocado oil, palm oil, and peanut oil.
Remember to avoid fats that contain a high percentage of polyunsaturated fats when cooking.

, These fats can be used for medium to high-heat cooking such as sautéing, stir frying, and pan frying. These cooking fats start to burn and degrade around 350 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (175 to 205 degrees Celsius).Some examples of cooking fats with a medium smoke point are chicken fat, lard, some varieties of ghee, butter, canola oil, coconut oil, and vegetable shortening.

, These fats are typically liquid fats like oils. Fats with a low smoke point should be eaten raw. These fats start to burn and degrade below 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius). They can be used to make salad dressings or drizzled on food to enhance the flavors of the food.Hemp oil and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) have a low smoke point.

"
"
Buy a small amount of oil at a time.,
Store your cooking fats in a cool, dark place.,
Take care when re-using cooking fat.",How to Choose the Right Cooking Fat4," Do this instead of buying large containers of oil. This will decrease the likelihood that the oil will oxidize and spoil., After you are finished using your cooking fats, secure and store them immediately. Because oxygen, light, and heat are the main causes of oxidation, store your fats in a cool, dark cupboard or the refrigerator., Before using the fat, look for signs of deterioration. Having a dark color, a low viscosity, or a foul odor are signs that your fat has gone bad.Do not use rancid or spoiled fats. The quality and taste of food cooked with rancid fat will be tainted.

",How to Broil Fish3," You should pull the rack out enough so that you can easily place the fish on the pan but not so much that you remove the rack.

, You may want to curl up the edges of the foil so that any juices don’t pour out onto the cooking pan and burn; this will also save you cleanup time.

,, Expect to cook the fish for about 5 to 7 minutes for every inch of thickness. However, check the fish often to prevent burning.

, Let it sit and rest for about a minute before loosening it from the foil.

, You’ll need to use the widest spatula that you own to ensure that the fish does not fall apart when you remove it from the pan. If you used fish with the skin on one side, you may find that you can separate the flesh from the skin easily with the spatula at this point.

If there is an excess of foam or fat buildup, it’s possible that you have your heat turned too high. Stock needs to be slowly simmered over a long period of time, not boiled.
Typical stocks should be simmered anywhere from 4 to 6 hours long.;
, You can do this while your stock simmers in multiple intervals to cut down on the amount of fat you will need to strain later on.Stirring the fat into the stock will make it harder to remove later and give your stock a cloudy appearance.You can do this with a wooden or heat safe spoon.

, You can purchase a sieve or colander and cheesecloth at most grocery stores. Line the sieve with cheesecloth and drain your stock through it. This should separate the large pieces of bone and vegetables from the clear stock.


Make sure to do this over the sink in case there is spillage.
You can also use a colander instead of sieve.
Do not push down on the food at any time while you are draining it.If you don’t have cheesecloth you can use a coffee filter., Filter your stock again. This second filtering should remove most of the fat that remains in your stock.

Grasp the egg in your dominant hand.,
Hold it between your thumb and first two fingers.








,
Tap the belly of the egg firmly against a hard surface.,
Open the egg halves.,
Empty the egg into a bowl or pan.,
Finished.








",How to Break an Egg," You'll want to have maximum control over the egg; if you use your other hand, it might accidentally slip.






;
,, Make sure the part of the egg you tap is the widest part; if you break the egg near the top or bottom, it'll be more likely to shatter in your hands.









Some say eggs should be cracked against a flat surface, while others swear by rapping them against the edge of a metal bowl or pot. Either method works as well.
You can also tap something hard against the egg, rather than the other way around. Try taking a heavy knife or another heavy utensil and tapping it firmly across the center of the egg.

, Use the thumb of your second hand to push gently into the cracked part of the eggshell, then pull the halves apart with both hands. Do this gently, to minimize the chance that the egg will shatter or that small pieces of shell will get into your bowl.









Experienced chefs who have to crack dozens of eggs at a time are able to open the egg halves with one hand. To do this, center the cracked egg in your palm and hold it face-down over your bowl. Use your forefinger to stabilize the back of the egg, then pull it apart using your thumb and middle finger to separate the halves. This method takes a lot of practice!

, If you're using the whole egg, go ahead and pour it in, yolk and all.









To separate the whites and the yolk, position the egg over the bowl and gently pour the yolk back and forth between the egg halves so that the egg white drops into the bowl and the yolk is preserved whole in a shell half.

Strain stock through sieve and cheesecloth.",How to Clarify Stock2," Before you use the egg white method, you need to ensure that you first remove the large chunks of food. Put cheesecloth over the surface of your colander or sieve and drain it., Use two eggs and separate your egg whites into a bowl and beat them. Once your are done with that, stir in ¼ cups of cold water. The egg whites will bind any remaining particles, which will enable you to achieve a clearer stock.Read Separate-an-Egg if you don’t know how to separate egg whites from the yolk.

, Once the stock is back to a rolling boil, pour in your egg white and water mixture into the pot.


A rolling boil is achieved when bubbles are rapidly breaking the surface of the water. You should not be able to break the boil by using a spoon to stir your stock., All of the fat in your stock should bind to the egg whites while you let it sit. Let the stock sit at room temperature.


You should see your egg whites rise to the top and coagulate on the surface of your stock., Once all the fat has collecting onto the egg whites, do a final straining through a sieve and cheesecloth. Your large clump of egg whites and fat should be caught in the cheesecloth, leaving you with a clear and clarified stock.

",How to Clarify Stock3," Straining your stock is important in all methods of clarification.

, Sticking your stock into the refrigerator or freezer could potentially create bacteria. Instead, fill a bowl or your sink up with ice cubes, and place your pot, with the lid into the bed of ice. Stir the stock every 2-3 minutes until it is chilled.


Food that stays at 40°F(4°C) to 140°F(60° C) for more than two hours could be potentially dangerous to eat., Leaving your stock in the refrigerator for a couple of hours, or overnight, will allow all the excess fat to rise to the top and harden.There should be a thick layer of fat on the surface of your stock, even if you’ve already strained it.

, You can use a spoon or other utensil to carefully peel away the top layer of hardened fat. After you are done, you should be left with a flavorful, clear stock.You can use the leftover fat as lard in other recipes.

Wash your sweet potatoes.,
Peel the potato.,
Prepare a pot.,
Cook the potatoes for 10 minutes and then check them.,
Cook longer, if necessary.",How to Boil Sweet Potatoes1," You should always wash produce before cooking it. Sweet potatoes are no different. To wash sweet potatoes, run them under cold tap water. Remove any excess dirt or debris from the potato. Make sure the skin is completely clean before you proceed., You can either use a vegetable peeler or a pairing knife to remove a sweet potato's skin. You should also cut off either end of the potato with a knife.If you're having trouble peeling your sweet potato, scrub it with a produce brush first. This should loosen the skin, and make the peeling process easier.

, Find a pot that's big enough that you can fully emerge your sweet potato, or sweet potatoes, in water. You want to make sure all the potatoes fit comfortably without being crowded. You also want to make sure you have a cover for the pot you choose.Once you find a suitable pot, fill it about halfway full with tap water.
Add your sweet potato, or sweet potatoes, to the pot. Make sure they're all covered with water. If necessary, add a bit more water.
Bring the water to a boil.

, Add your sweet potato, or sweet potatoes, to the pot. Cover the pot and allow the potatoes to cook for about 10 minutes. After 10 minutes have passed, remove the cover from the pot.The potatoes should be tender enough that you can pierce the outside of the potatoes easily. However, you should not be able to pass the knife through the sweet potatoes.

, If your sweet potatoes are not tender enough after 10 minutes, cook them for an additional 10 to 15 minutes. You may also want to cook your sweet potatoes longer if you want very soft sweet potatoes, such as the kind you would use in mashed potatoes. These need to be cooked for 25 to 30 minutes.When the sweet potatoes are cooked to your desired tenderness, drain them with a colander and set them aside to cool.

Get acquainted with the settings.Broilers usually have two settings – on and off.,
Inspect the rack positions.,
Use a digital timer.Because things can burn easily when you’re broiling, you must keep a very close eye on your dishes.,
Protect your hands and arms.,
Use a shallow pan, skillet or baking sheet for broiling.",How to Broil1," Look for the “broil” button or dial on your oven. Some ovens will provide different broiling options, but these are generally very basic settings like “high” and “low.” Experiment a bit and check out what each setting does.


Before cooking anything, turn on the broiler at least five minutes in advance. This will ensure that it heats up completely.;
, Most broilers provide two to three rack positions. These positions dictate how close the food is to the broiler. The top two racks are usually three to five inches away from the heating element. Use these racks for browning gratins and cooking thin pieces of meat. Use the top rack with caution because it heats food up very quickly. Some foods can char within seconds on the top rack.









Ovens vary, but in general, food cooks at 550°F on the top rack.
There is usually a temperature drop of about 50°F to 70°F for each rack beneath it.If your oven provides three racks, use the middle one to broil things like thick steaks and bone-in chicken.

, As a backup, use a digital timer. A mechanical one is fine, too, but because the intense heat can char foods within seconds, a digital timer will help you be precise. Most foods will be ready to remove from the oven after broiling for five to ten minutes., When working around the intense heat of a broiler, you should use a high quality mitt that is long enough to protect your wrists and forearms from the heat. Look for brands that have a silicone coating on the outside – these usually can protect your skin up to 600°F. Avoid using a damp kitchen towel or mitts that are very thin or short., Whatever vessel you choose, it cannot be too deep or it won’t fit between the oven rack and the broiler. Cast-iron skillets operate very well under high-heat conditions, making them ideal for broiling.Look into grated broiler pans, as well. These are designed to be used with broilers and they allow heat to circulate under your food.Never use a glass baking dish under a broiler, not even Pyrex, because it might break under the intensity of the heat.








Always spray your pan with nonstick cooking spray before you place the food on it.
If you are planning to broil something messy, line your pan with aluminum foil first. This will make clean-up easier.

Make sure to remove any dirt or debris stuck to the sweet potato's skin., Choose a pot big enough to cover all your sweet potatoes with water. You also need a pot with a lid. Fill the pot with water until the sweet potatoes are covered in water. Place the pot over on the stove and cover it with a lid., Keep the pot over high heat for 10 minutes. Then, remove the lid and take a knife. Use the knife to make a small puncture mark on the sweet potato., Once you've punctured your sweet potato, cover the pot again. Allow the sweet potato to cook for an additional 20 minutes over high heat.When it's tender, you should be able to place a knife through the sweet potato without meeting any resistance. You may have to cook a sweet potato slightly longer if it's not done after 20 minutes.

, Use a colander to pour the hot water out of the pot. Allow the sweet potato to sit in the colander until it's cool to the touch. If you need to cool a sweet potato faster, you can place it under cool running water., After the boiling process is over, a sweet potato's skin should slip off easily. Use a pairing knife to make an initial slice into a sweet potato's skin. From there, you can simply peel off the skin as if you were peeling the skin of a banana."

Allow the meat to become room temperature before broiling.,
Brush both sides of the meat with oil or butter.,
Slide the pan of meat under the fully preheated broiler.,
Broil the meat until it is cooked through.",How to Broil2," If you broil a cut of meat that is too large or too thick, the outside will burn but the center will remain raw.Avoid broiling pieces of meat that exceed two pounds. Look for steaks that are one and a half pounds or less. Fish fillets are typically a good size for broiling.


Before broiling beef steaks and fillets, make them thinner by pounding them with a meat tenderizer. This will help them cook thoroughly and more quickly., If you put cold meat straight under a broiler, it won’t cook well. Take your meat out of the refrigerator beforehand and let it become room temperature before you begin.When your meat is almost room temperature, go ahead and preheat your broiler so that it will be nice and hot by the time you’re ready to place the meat in the oven.

, To prevent sticking, be sure to oil both sides of the meat before you begin broiling it. This is the case for all meats – beef, chicken and fish. If you have been marinating your meat in a mixture that already contains oil, you don’t need to brush it with any additional oil.


After oiling, place the meat on the broiling pan.Season the meat according to your tastes with dry seasonings. Avoid putting sauces on the meat before broiling, since these can burn quickly under the heat source.

, The size and thickness of the meat will dictate how close the pan should be to the heat source. In general, the thicker the cut, the further away it should be from direct heat. This will prevent the outside from scorching before the center has cooked through.


For every half inch of thickness, allow two inches of distance from the heat source.
Adjust your racks as needed and place the meat into your oven., The amount of time your meat broils will depend on how you want it cooked and how thick it is. You will need to watch it closely. Flip the cuts over once the first side has browned to ensure even cooking.Don’t use a fork to flip the meat, since this will puncture it and allow its juices to escape. Use tongs, a spatula or some other utensil to flip the meat over.









The goal when broiling meat is to get a brown, crusty exterior and a juicy center.Keep the meat or fish in the oven until it is cooked through and seared on the outside.

Brush the fruits and/or vegetables with butter.,
Place the vegetables and/or fruits on a baking dish or pan.,
Put the pan in the oven on the lower rack and broil the items.,
Remove the items when their exteriors have browned.",How to Broil3," Preheat your broiler and chop your vegetables and fruits to the size you want them. Keep in mind that the smaller the piece, the faster it will broil. You can also leave some items fully intact, like peppers. Melt a little butter and brush it on both sides of the items.


Broiling will create a unique and complex flavor. You can experiment with broiling almost any fruit or vegetable that you wish.Some popular choices are pineapple, banana, mango, pears, apples, asparagus, potatoes, zucchini, peaches, tomatoes and peppers.

, Use a shallow dish or pan that has sides so you can stir the pieces easily while you’re broiling them. This will ensure even cooking. Make sure to spread the fruits and/or vegetables out evenly so there is only one layer of them on the pan.


If you like, sprinkle a little sugar on the fruit pieces or salt on the vegetables before broiling them.

, Vegetables and fruits broil very quickly. Don’t put them on the top rack – they will broil too fast and probably burn. Use one of the lower racks that is at least five or six inches beneath the heating source.How long you leave the items under the broiler depends on how big the pieces are, but in general it will only take a few short minutes to broil any fruit or vegetable.


Supervise the items constantly so they do not burn.
Use a spatula to stir or flip the pieces so that both sides are broiled.

, Broiling vegetables and fruits causes their natural sugars to caramelize. On the outside they will be browned and slightly crisp. Inside they will be soft and juicy. The natural sugars will result in a sweet taste and the browned exterior will provide a toasty flavor with a pleasing texture.Serve warm. As an extra treat, serve broiled fruits with nonfat Greek yogurt, ice cream, or sprinkled nuts."

Select smooth, ripe potatoes.,
Wash your potatoes.,
Leave the skin in place.,
Chop the potatoes.,
Submerge your potatoes in water.,
Bring the pot to a boil.,
Simmer the potatoes until they're tender.,
Use the boiled red potatoes for mashed potatoes.,
Make potato salad.,
Top with cheese.,
Sprinkle with additional spices or dressings.,
Make “loaded” potatoes.",How to Boil Red Potatoes," Make sure the potatoes you choose to boil are good for cooking. When at the store, examine the potatoes you pick. Go for potatoes with skin that is smooth and free of any bumps or discoloration. Potatoes, when ripe, are also firm.Dark spots, sprouts, and shades of green all indicate a potato may not be ripe.;
, Before boiling your potatoes, wash them under running water. Use either a brush or your hands to scrub the surface, removing any visible dirt or grime.Do not use soap to wash your potatoes.

, Red potatoes can actually be boiled with the skin still on. This better preserves the flavor during the boiling process and adds a nice texture. A potato's skin is also rich in nutrients., Potatoes boil faster when chopped into small chunks. Cut your potato into small cubes of roughly even size.If you're going to be mashing the potatoes, you do not have to worry too much about precise size. However, if you're making something like potato salad, consult your recipe. It should advise you on the correct sized chunks.
When not following a recipe, chunk about an inch or half an inch thick (2.5 or 1.2 centimeters) should be sufficient.

, Place your potatoes in a pot. Cover the potatoes with enough water so they are fully submerged.As salt helps flavor potatoes as they cook, add about one and a half to tablespoons of salt to the water (22.5 to 30 mL)., Place the pot over the stove on high heat. Leave the pot on the stove until the water comes to a boil., Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to medium-high. Simmer your potatoes for 10 to 15 minutes. When they're done, the potatoes should be tender.You should be able to easily cut through the potatoes with a fork.

When you're done, you can drain the potatoes over the sink using a colander.
If you're using a specific recipe, consult that recipe. If your recipe requires firmer potatoes, you may need to simmer your potatoes for a shorter timeframe.

, While russet (brown) potatoes are more commonly used for mashed potatoes, red potatoes can make excellent mashed potatoes, too. If you want mashed potatoes, you can easily mash your potatoes with a fork after boiling them.


It may help to boil the potatoes for 5 to 10 minutes longer if mashing them, as they'll be more tender.
In addition to butter, add some milk to your potatoes before mashing them.

, If you want to use your red potatoes for cold potato salad, boil them, drain them, and place them in the refrigerator for an hour or so until they cool. Then, you can mix them with other ingredients to make potato salad.


Chop the potatoes once cool. The pieces should be less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick.
Toss the potatoes with 6 hard boiled and chopped eggs, 1 lb (450 g) fried and crumbled bacon, 1 stalk chopped celery, 1 chopped onion, and 2 cups (500 ml) mayonnaise until evenly mixed.Keep the potato salad cool until you serve it.

, A simple way to dress up your boiled red potatoes is simply to cover them with melted or toasted cheese. Parmesan cheese works for a quick, no fuss dressing, but cheddar cheese or mozzarella cheese works well if you are willing to put in a few extra minutes of effort.


Grated Parmesan cheese can just be sprinkled on without any additional work.
For shredded cheddar, mozzarella, or other similar cheeses, sprinkle the boiled and drained potatoes. Microwave the cheese-covered potatoes for 30 seconds to melt the cheese.
If you want to toast the cheese lightly and give the edges of the potatoes a mildly crispy edge, transfer the boiled and cheese-covered potatoes to a greased baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) on the top rack of the oven.

, Red potatoes are versatile, so they can work well with many dressings made from savory herbs or savory spices. Experiment with different spices to add flavor to your potatoes.


For instance, a quick way to add color and flavor to your boiled and drained red potatoes would be to sprinkle them with 1 tsp (5 ml) of paprika.
Similarly, you can combine 1 tsp (5 ml) of paprika with 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of olive oil, whisking well until combined. Toss the cooked and drained potatoes in this mixture so that they benefit from the flavors of both the paprika and the oil.

, While loaded potatoes tend to be baked russet potatoes, you can create a similar dish with boiled and drained red potatoes. This can be a great appetizer for a party.


If the potatoes are not already quartered, cut them into quarters.
Place a serving size on a dish.
Coat with butter and toss until covered. Cover with a sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and a dash of chopped fresh chives or green onions. Consider sprinkling with bacon bits, as well.

Purchase fresh broccoli.,
Clean the broccoli with vinegar and water.,
Cut the stalks away from the florets.",How to Boil Broccoli1," Look for broccoli that is uniformly green, without a lot of brown or yellow areas. Feel the stem and crown to make sure they are firm and not limp. Check that the florets are in a nice, tight bunch.You can store raw broccoli in your refrigerator drawer for at least a week. However, its nutritional properties will begin to decline after three days.;
, Fill a spray bottle with three parts water to one part white vinegar. Spray the broccoli well.Alternately, soak the broccoli in vinegar water before cooking it, which will also drive out any insects that may be in it.Rinse the vegetables under cold tap water.


You can wash produce with water alone, but using the diluted vinegar method first removes about 98% of surface bacteria.
To make rinsing easier, place the broccoli in a colander inside of a clean sink basin. Use the spray setting on your faucet to rinse the vegetables.

, Use a sharp knife to cut through the vegetable stem about two inches below the crown. Break the crown apart into big florets. Slice each floret’s trunk to get bite-sized chunks.Remove any damaged or wilted leaves.If desired, save the stalks to add to stew, salad, or stir-fry.You can leave the stalks on if your recipe calls for it. Just peel back and remove the outermost layer, which is tough to eat, with a knife or vegetable peeler.

"
"
Bring a pot of water to a boil.,
Cook the stalks first.,
Add the florets.,
Cool the vegetables.",How to Boil Broccoli2," Pour enough water in a pot that it will completely submerge your broccoli. Add a sprinkle of salt to the water. Set the heat to high.You can use regular table salt or sea salt.
If you’re unsure whether you’ll have enough water in the pot to cover the broccoli, you can put the broccoli in the pot and cover it with water. Then take it back out and set it aside.

, Wait until the water has reached a rolling boil. If you want to cook the stalks, add them to the pot. Cook them for two minutes.Broccoli stalks take longer to cook then florets.

, Lower the florets gently into the boiling water with a slotted spoon.Cook them in the pot with the stalks, if applicable, for four to five minutes. Don’t overcook them, or they will lose texture and taste.The broccoli is done when it is tender enough to easily insert the tip of a knife.

, Remove them with tongs or drain them with a heat-safe colander. Spread the broccoli on a baking sheet. Allow it to cool down at room temperature.If you believe you may have cooked the broccoli too long, you can place the baking sheet into your fridge to speed up the cooling process.

Boil water.,
Prepare an ice bath.,
Cook the broccoli in boiling water.,
Test the doneness with the tip of a sharp knife.,
Plunge the broccoli into the ice bath immediately.,
Leave the broccoli in the ice bath to cool.",How to Boil Broccoli3," Put a large pot of water over high heat. Add between a sprinkle and a tablespoon of salt to the water, if desired.Allow the pot of water to come to a boil.Adding salt is optional. The advantage is that it will enhance the broccoli’s flavor. The disadvantage is that, over time, the sodium will cause the broccoli to be mushier.

, Fill a large bowl with ice and cold water. Use a container that is at least five quarts. Alternately, you can use a clean sink basin with a drain stopper.Skipping this step will affect the color and texture of your broccoli., Lower the broccoli into the water with a slotted spoon. Let it cook for about three minutes., If the vegetable clings onto the knife, it’s not yet done. If the knife goes in and out with ease, the broccoli is done.

, Take the broccoli out of the water with tongs or a slotted spoon. “Shock” it by putting it into the ice bath.Shocking vegetables cooks them moderately, then cools them rapidly so they stay crunchy., Allow the broccoli to sit in the ice bath for about five minutes. Don’t remove the broccoli from the ice bath until it is entirely cool, or it will keep cooking from the inside out."

Rinse the artichokes in cold water.,
Slice the stems off of the artichokes.,
Cut the tops off of the artichokes.,
Snip the tops off of the outer leaves.,
Fill a pot half full with water and bring it to a boil.,
Add the artichokes to the boiling water.,
Lower the heat to a simmer.,
Test the tenderness of the artichokes.,
Remove the artichokes from the water.,
Select an artichoke at right time of year.,
Check the leaves.,
Feel the weight and shape of the artichoke.",How to Boil Artichokes," Washing an artichoke should be done right before cooking, not before storing. Washing an artichoke before storing can make it spoil faster.


Store fresh, unwashed artichokes in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for up to a week. Keep an eye on them, and if leaves start to spread, cook them immediately.;
, Use a very sharp knife to either slice the whole stem off at the base, or keep most of the stem but just cut the end off.


If you don’t have a really sharp knife, use a serrated knife.
The artichoke’s stem is edible, so you can simply cut the very end off of it and then cook and eat it with the rest of artichoke., Only remove the top inch of each artichoke, slicing evenly across. Be careful not to cut too far down, or you’ll risk losing some of the best edible parts of the artichoke.


Rub the cut parts of each artichoke with a lemon. Be sure to use lemon on all the cut tops and bottoms to prevent browning.

, Use sharp kitchen scissors to remove the top 1/2 inch of each leaf. Only remove the spiny, pointed tops from the leaves.


Once you've snipped the leaves, rub each one with more lemon., Set the stove on high heat and salt the water liberally.


Setting the stove on high heat encourages the water to boil faster.
Salting the cooking water helps to flavor the artichokes while they boil.

, Place them in the pot and then let the water come back up to a boil.


Adding the artichokes will cool the water temporarily and slow the boiling, so let water come back up to a boil for just a moment.

, Cover the artichokes and leave them to cook for 20-30 minutes. If you cut the whole stem off of each artichoke, you'll need to weigh the artichokes down in the pot.


To weight the artichokes down, use a small lid or an inverted plate that fits inside of the pot. This will keep the artichokes from bobbing up out of the water and cooking improperly., They are ready when you can easily remove a leaf from the middle.Use a fork or the point of your knife to remove the center leaf.Be careful when testing the artichokes, as they have been sitting in hot water and can burn you.
You can also check for tenderness by poking the base of an artichoke with your knife., Once they’ve been removed, drain them in a colander and plate them for serving.


Season the artichokes however you wish. Peel the leaves off to eat one by one, or cut the artichoke heart out.
Serve the artichoke leaves and hearts with a delicious drawn butter or a flavorful sauce.

, Artichokes are at their best in Spring. The peak season for artichokes is from March to May, so you’ll find the freshest ones in those three months.Look for the right coloring. A fresh artichoke will be a nice, deep green shade.A few brown spots are okay, but the artichoke should generally look very fresh and green., A good artichoke should have tight, vibrant green leaves. Loose or dry leaves mean that the artichoke isn’t in the best shape.Squeeze the leaves against each other, and they should make a squeaking sound if the artichoke is good.

, It should feel plump and a bit heavier than it looks.


A smaller artichoke will be more tender than a larger one, while a rounder artichoke will have a bigger heart than a more narrow one."

Thaw your crab.,
Clean the front of your crab.,
Clean the bottom of your crab.",How to Boil Crab1," While we do not recommend buying frozen crab - the taste won't be as strong - if you chose a frozen crab it needs to thaw. You can thaw it by placing it whole in a sink of cool water. You don't want to leave your crab in the water too long - 15 to 20 minutes should be sufficient., The first thing you want to do with crab is give it a good scrub down. Crabs are not known to be hygienic animals, and the waters where they are caught are usually not very clean. It's recommended you use a scrubbing brush with a handle, as this tool is easy to maneuver and can be used with a fair amount of force.


Wear a pair of dish gloves, especially if your crab is live. It will likely try to fight back by pinching and flailing and the gloves can protect your hands.
Dump the crab in the sink. If you have more than one crab, clean them one at a time. If your crab is live, try to make sure it's back is turned to you so it does not attack. You can do this by distracting the crab or, if you're brave enough, simply turning it around by force.
Turn on the water with one hand and pin the crab with the other. Crabs are fairly strong. If your crab is live, do not hesitate to use the full force of your body to restrain it.
Scrub the top part of your crab with your scrub brush. Use a lot of force here to make sure you get all the dirt and grime off the crab.

, Now that your crab's topside is good and clean, it's time to clean the other half. Flip the crab over. This task can be intimidating, but remember - your crab is likely disoriented from the washing process. It is less likely to resist. Give the underside and legs a good scrub, once again using a good deal of pressure. You might want to hold onto some of its legs as you work, just as precaution in case the crab tries to pinch."

Slice the snow peas makes them easier to handle and to eat.,
Cut the peas in half on the bias (that is, not straight across but at a diagonal).,
Use them whole.,
Season with olive oil.,
Season with Italian seasoning.,
Season with salt.",How to Prepare Snow Peas for Cooking," Snow peas are available in the produce section of most grocery stores. Here’s what to look for when selecting snow peas to eat:


Pick snow peas that are crisp with brightly colored pods.
Avoid snow peas that are swollen or larger than 3 inches (7.6 cm) long--they tend to be tough.Also avoid snow peas that are dry along the edges, have yellow spots, or are wrinkled.
Snow peas that are in a sealed container and refrigerated can be stored for several days.;
, Place the snow peas in a colander and rinse in running cold water, swirling the peas.


As an alternative, you can immerse a colander of snow peas in a bowl of cold water and swirl.

, It’s important to trim off the stems of snow peas because the stems will be tough.


The stem end will have a small cap on the end, perhaps with a short stem attached.
Leave the other end (the end with a slight curl to it) intact for now. You’ll need it to help you remove the “string.”

, Hold the snow pea and grasp the small curl at the bottom of the pod. Pinch it until it is completely off. If you have trouble removing the end, use a small knife to help you.
Grasping the curly end, pull it downward along the pod to remove the “string.”

, You can slice the peas into thin strips lengthwise (julienne) for use in a marinated salad, a spring salad, lumpia, tacos, or pasta.


For instructions on how to julienne vegetables, see How to Julienne.

, Cutting on the bias exposes more surface area of the vegetable for cooking.


Hold the blade of your knife so that it’s at an angle to the pea.
Slice down with the blade to cut the pea in half, making sure to keep the blade angled so the resulting cut goes diagonally across the pea.
The greater the angle of your cut, the greater the surface area of the pea that will be exposed for cooking.
Continue cutting the rest of the peas on the bias, making sure that the pieces are all approximately the same size.

, Snow peas can also be served whole. There are several uses for whole snow peas, including:


Using raw snow peas as dippers for hummus or ranch or to add crunch to a salad.
Snow peas as a side dish. You can serve whole snow peas glazed, sauteed, stir-fried, or steamed.

, Olive oil is a great base for seasoning and cooking snow peas.


To season with olive oil, drizzle the oil over the snow peas, then add salt and pepper to taste. Snow peas prepared this way may be eaten raw, if you choose.
To cook snow peas with olive oil, add about a tablespoon of oil to a pan under medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the snow peas along with salt and pepper to taste and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until the peas are bright and crisp., Italian seasoning is a spice blend available at most grocery stores. It is a great blend to use on snow peas.


Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat.
Optional: add a clove of minced garlic and cook for a minute or two until fragrant.
Add the snow peas, 1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning, a tablespoon of water and cook until the peas are brightly colored, about two minutes.
Optional: add salt and pepper to taste., Boiled and lightly salted snow peas make a great snack or vegetable dipper.


Place snow peas in a medium-sized pot.
Add water to the pot until the snow peas are covered.
Boil until they’re bright and tender, about 1 to 2 minutes.
Drain the snow peas and season with salt.

Freeze the crabs before boiling.,
Fill a stock pot with water.,
Salt and flavor the water.,
Place the crabs in the boiling water.,
Prepare an ice bath.,
Remove the crabs.,
Cool the crabs.",How to Boil Crab2," With live crabs, you should place them in a freezer for approximately 15 minutes prior to cooking. This numbs the crab, which is more humane, and also slows their movements so they will not resist as much when being placed in boiling water., A stock pot is a large, steel pot, typically 12 to 14 ounces. It's suggested you use your largest stock pot for boiling crabs.

, Make sure to salt the water heavily. This helps in the cooking process, and gives crabs their oceanic flavor. Add your choice of spices to the water. Many people use bay leaves, beer, white wine, black peppercorn, and paprika.

, Using tongs to avoid getting pinched, lower the crabs into the boiling water with their legs facing down. It is best to only boil one crab at a time, as they might fight or pinch with one another. Cover the pan and reduce the heat to a simmer when the water resumes boiling., While the crabs are boiling, prepare an ice bath by filling a large bowl with ice and water.

, Depending on the crab's size, they should take 10-15 minutes to float to the top of the water. Once they are floating, wait an additional 2-3 minutes before removing them with your tongs.

, Place the freshly cooked crabs into an ice bath to stop the cooking process. In about one minute, they should be cool to the touch and ready to be handled. Many parts of the crab need to be removed before serving, and you are now ready to begin that process."

It should come off easily, especially after cleaning and boiling., Stick your thumb in the hole just to left of where you removed the abdomen. Lift up firmly. The outer shell should come off with some guts attached.

, You will see a pair of leaf-like, spongy gills on either side of the crab. These should be removed and discarded.

, Some greenish-brown guts will be attached to the crab's body. Rinse them out in your sink, making sure all of the guts are thoroughly removed as they are not suitable for consumption., The mandibles are the mouth parts attached to the front of the crab. Simply break them off and then discard.

,


Turn the crab upside down and grip it on either side. Place your thumbs under the mid-line of the back, where the shell used to be.

Twist the legs and claws off the crab's body.
Using a mallet or nutcracker, crack the shell of each leg and claw.
Cut the body into quarts with a knife.
Break apart the legs and claws and, using your finger or a knife, remove the meat. Pull the body sections apart and dig out pockets of meat. One whole, cooked crab should yield 7.5 to 8 ounces of meat., If you prefer to serve the crab in its shell, simply provide seafood crackers or mallets alongside the remaining crab. Many people enjoy crab with melted butter, aioli, or cucumber mignonette for dipping., If you don't finish all your crab in one night, be sure to place it in the fridge or freezer within 2 hours of cooking for optimal safety.


To refrigerate your crab, store it in covered airtight containers. Crab generally keeps for 3 to 5 days when refrigerated.
If you decide to freeze your crab to extend its shelf life, place it in a plastic airtight container or heavy-duty freezer bags. It should keep for about 3 months."

Serve the smoothie.",How to Cut a Papaya," Papayas are ripe when their green skin has started turning yellow and looks bruised. When you press the papaya, you should be able to make a slight indentation, but the papaya should not be completely soft.









If a papaya mushy or smells overly sweet, it's too ripe to eat. If it's green and quite firm, it needs to ripen for a few days. Set it on your counter and allow it to turn a little yellow.
Both the large, long Caribbean papaya variety and the smaller Hawaiian variety can be tested for ripeness in this way.
Papayas bruise extremely easily, so handle it with care on the way home from the market.

, The green skin of the papaya is not edible, but it's still important to wash the fruit to prevent contaminating the inside when you cut into it.








, Use a cutting board or a countertop. Papayas are quite juicy and can make a bit of a mess, so you may want to have a dishtowel handy for cleanup.








, Papayas are very soft inside, so handle it gently. Use the sharpest knife you have, or a serrated bread knife, to get a clean cut. Start by cutting off the top end of the papaya.








, Make sure the flesh inside looks ripe and fresh. It should have a slightly funny smell.








, Use a spoon to remove the black seeds and the sticky membrane that coats them.








, Use a sawing motion to slice off the skin. Repeat with all four quarters.








, Eat them fresh and unadorned, or use them to make one of the recipes below.








, Wash a ripe papaya, slice it in half lengthwise, discard the seeds and slice off the skin. Cut the papaya into a few large pieces. A papaya smoothie is delicious on its own, but you can also choose to make it with other fruit. Consider these options:









Fresh or frozen blueberries. Blueberries have a lot of antioxidants, and paired with papaya they would make a powerfully healthy smoothie.
Kiwi and avocado. The kiwi offsets the papaya's sweetness with its bright flavor, and avocado makes for an especially creamy smoothie.
Spinach or kale. Making a ""green"" smoothie is a great way to get a serving of vegetables at breakfast. Papaya is so sweet and flavorful that you won't be able to taste the greens.;
, Papayas taste good with both cream and juice bases. Try one of the following bases to thin out your smoothie:









A cup of yogurt, either flavored or plain.
A cup of almond or cashew milk.
A cup of orange juice or apple juice.

, Enhance your smoothie with extra flavors or supplements to make it a complete meal. Consider the following options:









A scoop of protein powder.
A few spoonfuls of chia seeds.
A tablespoon of peanut or almond butter.

, Place the fruit, base, and extras in a blender. Put the lid on the blender and use the ""liquify"" button to blend the ingredients until they are smooth.









If you like a thinner smoothie, add more juice, milk or water.
If you prefer your smoothies on the thicker side, add a few spoonfuls of instant oatmeal. Blend until smooth.

, Pour it into a glass and drink it with a straw, or if you made it extra thick, eat it with a spoon.

Choose a fresh head of cabbage.,
Use a stainless steel knife.,
Keep the cutting board stable.,
Clean your working area and supplies.",How to Cut a Cabbage Into Wedges1," Fresh cabbage can be identified by its crisp leaves. The leaves should be tightly packed for round varieties and only slightly loose for long varieties. Additionally, there should be no signs of browning and the stem should look fresh rather than dry.


Green cabbage is a round variety. Its leaves should be tightly packed together and dark green on the outside. The inner leaves will be a pale green.
Red cabbage is another round variety, and its leaves should also be tightly packed together. The outer leaves are especially tough, and all of the leaves should have a reddish purple color.
Savoy cabbage is a round variety, but its leaves are crinkled and fairly loose when compared to green and red cabbages. The leaves can range in color from dark green to light green.
Napa cabbage is tall and skinny, with loose, pale green leaves.;
, Use a sharp, stainless steel cooking knife with a smooth, sturdy blade.


Only use stainless steel knives. Do not use knives made from other metals, because the natural chemicals within the cabbage can react with other metals. As a result, both the cabbage and knife can turn black., Spread a moist paper towel in between the cutting board and the counter to prevent the cutting board from sliding around.


Soak the paper towel in water and squeeze out the excess moisture. This gives the towel just enough tension to prevent it and the cutting board from sliding around.






Do not let the towel stay soaked, though, since a soaked paper towel will be too slippery.






Note that this may not be necessary if you are using a no-slip silicone cutting mat.







, Make sure that your hands, the knife, and the cutting board are all clean before you begin.

Use warm water and soap to clean your hands and all the supplies used for cutting the cabbage.






Rinse the knife and cutting board with clean, running water to remove all soapy residue. Wipe dry with clean, dry paper towels.






Do not clean the cabbage yet. The cabbage should be rinsed after you cut it, not beforehand.

To keep the potatoes from getting soggy, it’s a good idea to rinse them in a colander under running water from the sink.;
, Depending on what dish you are using the cubed potatoes in, you may prefer to remove the skin from them before cutting. Use a vegetable peeler to carefully take off of the outer layer of skin from the potatoes and discard.








If you don’t plan to cut the potatoes right after peeling them, place them in a bowl or pot of cold water to keep them from browning.
When you’re peeling the potatoes, remove any sprouts or green spots in the flesh with the end of your vegetable peeler.

, To begin cubing the potatoes, use a sharp knife to cut the potato in half vertically. Turn the potatoes over on your cutting board so the flat side is facing down.








A chef’s knife works well for cutting potatoes.

, Once the potatoes have been cut in half, use your knife to chop each half into sections lengthwise. You can make the cuts as thick or as thin as you’d like, depending on how large you’d like your cubes to be.








After you’ve cut the halves into sections lengthwise, flatten each section on your cutting board to make them easier to slice in the next step.

, When all of the potato pieces are laying flat on your cutting board, slice each into lengthwise pieces with your knife again. The finished pieces will resemble French fries.







, After you’ve cut all of the potato pieces, create several equal-sized stacks with them. Turn each stack 90 degrees so they’re facing you horizontally.








If you prefer, you can cut each potato piece individually. However, you should keep in mind that it will take longer to dice them one at a time.

, When your potato pieces are stacked in front of your, use your knife to cut through them horizontally to create cubes. You can make the cubes as large or as small as you’d like, but keep the size uniform so they’ll cook evenly no matter how you prepare them.








Cubing your potatoes works well if you want to make mashed, sauteed, or roasted potatoes. You may also want to cube the potatoes if you’re making home fries.

;
, Scoop out the core of the pair (the section with seeds) using a melon baller or a teaspoon-sized measuring spoon. The instrument you select depends on the firmness of the pear--the melon baller is better for hard fruit, while the measuring spoon is better for soft.








, Slice out the stem by cutting a ""V"" shape around its edges using a knife, as shown in the image.








, Remove the pear’s skin using a small, sharp knife or a vegetable peeler. Now you can use the pear for your recipe or eat it as is.









You can also leave the skin on, since it's edible and very good for you, but it might throw off the texture of your recipe if you do.
If you like, you can also peel the pear before you core it.

, The first thing to do is peel the pear using a small, sharp knife or vegetable peeler.









If you want a perfectly smooth pear for poaching, the vegetable peeler is your best bet.
After it's peeled, go over the pear with the peeler a second time to remove any rough ridges.

, Starting at the bottom of the pear, use a melon baller or teaspoon sized measuring spoon to scoop out the base of the pair, followed by the core. The pear will look whole when standing upright, but will have a hole at the bottom where the core has been removed.









Alternatively, you can use a fruit corer - a special tool designed to remove the cores from fruit. Simply place the end of the corer (which is essentially a hollow metal tube) over the stem then press it downwards, forcing it all the way through the center of the pear. Give it one or two turns, then draw it out. You will now have a perfectly cored pear.
If the pear is a little wobbly after coring, you can cut an even slice from the bottom so it stands upright.

, If you're not ready to use your cored pears just yet, place them in a bowl of cold water with a few slices of lemon. This will prevent them from oxidizing and turning brown.

Remove the outer leaves.,
Cut the cabbage head in half.,
Cut the halves into quarters.,
Remove only part of the stems.,
Cut into eighths, if desired.,
Wash the cabbage.",How to Cut a Cabbage Into Wedges2," Round cabbages have tightly packed leaves and are spherical in shape. Common varieties include green cabbage, red cabbage, and savoy cabbage.

, Use your hands to peel off any tough or damaged outer leaves from the head of cabbage.


Round heads of cabbage with tightly packed leaves have thick outer leaves. Even if these leaves are in good shape, you should still remove them before cutting the cabbage, since they tend to be tough and not especially appetizing. This is especially true if you plan on eating the cabbage raw.






Any wilted or discolored portions must also be removed.







, Place the head of cabbage on its core end and slice it in half lengthwise, from the top center straight down and through the core.


If you cut the cabbage open and suspect that worms or insects have caused damage to the interior, you can still use the cabbage. You need to soak it in salt water for 20 minutes before continuing any further, though., Place each half cut-side down and cut in half lengthwise once more, creating quarters.


You can stop here, but the wedges may still be too wide for use in many recipes.

, Flip the quarters over to reveal the cut sides. Cut a wedge at the bottom into the core of each quarter. Only cut away part of the core, however, not all of it.


Keeping part of the core connected to the leaves will make it easier to keep the layers of leaves in each core held together.If you cut out the core completely, the leaves are likely to separate. The cabbage will still be edible, but the wedges will be ruined.






While looking at the core, cut a triangular wedge into the top portion of the core but not all the way through it. Slice a large portion of the wedge away while leaving a thin layer behind.






If you are anxious about cutting away some without cutting away too much, you could also simply leave the core intact. The core is tougher than the leaves, but it becomes tender and edible once cooked.







, If you want smaller wedges, place each quarter whole-side-down and cut the quarter in half lengthwise, from the top tip through the remainder of the bottom core.


This is usually the preferred wedge size. If you cut the wedges any smaller, you run the risk of causing them to break apart.

, Gently rinse each wedge of cabbage under cool running water. Drain dry on clean paper towels.


The inside of a cabbage is usually clean, but you should still rinse it under running water just to be on the safe side.






Hold the cabbage wedges over a colander in case any of the leaves separate and fall off under the pressure of the running water. The colander will catch the leaves while letting the water pass through.






You do not need to scrub the leaves when cleaning them.






To dry the wedges after rinsing them, lay them out flat in a single layer on several layers of dry paper towels for a few minutes. The excess water should fall off on its own.

Remove the outer leaves.,
Cut the head in half lengthwise.,
Cut each half in half again.,
Cut crosswise, if desired.,
Rinse the cabbage.",How to Cut a Cabbage Into Wedges3," Long cabbages have somewhat loose leaves and are somewhat rod-shaped. The most common variety is the napa cabbage.

, Use your hands to peel away damaged leaves on the head of cabbage.


Tall heads of cabbage with loose leaves lack the thicker outer leaves that round heads have. As such, you only need to remove leaves that are wilted, discolored, or otherwise damaged.

, Place the head of cabbage on its side and cut in half lengthwise, from the top of the head through the core.


You do not need to remove any part of the core when cutting a long cabbage. In fact, for wedges, it is actually beneficial to keep the core. The core holds the leaves together, which means that the wedges will be able to remain intact, as well.

, Flip each half over so that the cut-side faces the cutting board. Cut in half lengthwise once more, creating quarters.


Since these cabbages are tall and skinny, you probably will not be able to cut wedges that are any skinnier than this without causing the leaves to fall off the core.

, You can stop after cutting the cabbage into quarters, but if these pieces are too long for you, cut each quarter in half crosswise to reduce the length of each wedge to half.


Note, however, that any wedge not attached to the core is more likely to fall apart. Even if the wedge gets destroyed, though, the cabbage will still be edible.

, Gently rinse each wedge under cool, running water. Drain dry on layers of clean paper towels.


Even though the inside of a cabbage is usually clean, you should still rinse it under running water just to be safe.






Hold the cabbage wedges over a colander in case any of the leaves break off under the pressure of the running water. The colander will catch the leaves while letting the running water pass through.






You should not scrub the leaves when cleaning them.






To dry the wedges after rinsing them, lay them out in a single layer on a few dry paper towels for several minutes. The excess water should drain off on its own.

Sprinkle in some salt to taste, and heat the water over medium-high heat until it comes to a full boil, which should take about 5 to 10 minutes.








Salting the water is an optional step. You can skip if you’re trying to limit the sodium in the dish.

, Once the water has a come to a boil, add 2 pounds (1 kg) of waxy potatoes that have been cubed to the pot. Let the potatoes cook in the boiling water for 4 to 5 minutes, or until they are slightly softened.








Some waxy potatoes to consider for the dish include Yukon gold, new, or red.
Be careful not to cook the potatoes too long. You don’t want them to become so tender that they fall apart when you saute them.

, When the potatoes are finished boiling, pour them into a colander. Shake the colander well to ensure that all of the excess moisture is removed. Next, let the potatoes sit in the colander for about 5 minutes to allow them to dry further and cool off.







, While the potatoes are cooling, add 4 to 6 tablespoons (60 to 90 ml) of olive oil to a large nonstick skillet. Allow the oil to heat on medium until it begins to shimmer, which should take 5 to 7 minutes.








If you prefer, you can substitute butter for the olive oil.

, Once the oil is hot enough, add the cubed potatoes to the skillet in a single layer. Let the potatoes cook over medium heat for about 1 minute, stirring them around so they cook evenly on all sides.








If your skillet isn’t very large, you may want to saute the potatoes in two or more batches. You don’t want them packed into the pan.

, After the potatoes have sauteed for a minute, add 4 peeled and minced garlic cloves to the skillet. Stir the mixture well so the garlic is fully incorporated, and continue cooking the potatoes until they are golden brown on all sides, which should take approximately 4 to 6 minutes.








You can adjust the amount of garlic to suit your tastes. If you are a fan of garlic, mix in a little more. If you prefer a mild garlic flavor, add a little less.

, When the potatoes are golden brown, add some kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to the skillet to taste. Be sure to stir the potatoes well to ensure that they’re evenly seasoned.







, After you’ve seasoned the potatoes, reduce the heat to medium low. Let the potatoes cook for another 5 minutes, or until they are tender.








You can tell the potatoes are done when you can easily pierce them with a fork.

, When the potatoes are finished cooking, take the skillet off the stove. Carefully spoon the potatoes onto a serving platter, and dust the top with 3 tablespoons (11 g) of chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley. Serve the potatoes as a side with your favorite protein main course.








If you want to make the sauteed potatoes ahead of time, place them on a cookie sheet and keep them warm in an oven set to the lowest temperature.

, Put the chestnuts in single layer in a glass baking dish. It doesn’t matter if the chestnuts are touching, but they should not be on top of each other. Cover the dish with a layer of waxed paper.

, Put the glass dish covered with wax paper into the microwave. The chestnuts are ready when the shells start to pull back. You can microwave the chestnuts for a minute more if the shells haven’t pulled back after 6 minutes., Allow the chestnuts to cool for a minute because they may be very hot after removing them from the microwave. Use a small, but sharp knife to peel off shells and as much of the inner brown skins as possible. This may take some effort, so work slowly and carefully in order to avoid injury."

Slice off the ends of the squash.,
Peel the skin from the outside of the squash.,
Stand the squash on the cutting surface.,
Cut the squash in half along the length of the squash.,
Spoon the seeds out of the center.,
Lay the squash down on the cutting board.,
Separate the bulbous end from the narrower top section of the squash.,
Cut 1 inch strips out of the length of the squash.,
Halve the deeper portions of squash along the length.,
Cross cut the strips into 1 inch cubes.",How to Cube Butternut Squash," It is best to use a sharpened chef’s knife to cut the hard flesh of an uncooked butternut squash. The chef’s knife should have a large blade long enough to reach beyond the width of the largest end of the squash. Slice about 1/4 inch from the bottom of the squash and another 1/4 inch from the stem end of the squash.Gently push the knife through the skin until you feel it is secure in the meat of the squash and not going to slip, then apply more pressure to cut through the squash.
Throw away or compost the portion of squash you cut off.;
, Use a sharp vegetable peeler to remove the skin from the outside of the squash. Hold the squash in one hand and peel down the length of the squash in strips until all of the skin has been removed.Remove the skin completely, but don't peel so deeply that you remove too much of the squash's meat.
You may find that a Y-shaped peeler with a serrated blade is the best choice to peel the skin.
Poke holes in the skin of the squash with a fork and microwave it for 2 minutes to make peeling easier., The squash should be able to stand on its own on the flat portion created by slicing off the bulbous end. If the slice was not straight enough for the squash to balance on end, make another slice to even out the bottom, then stand the squash up on the board., Place your knife on the center of the top of the squash and cut down the length of the squash to the bottom. This can be difficult since the flesh is tough.If you struggle to get the knife through the squash, try using a mallet to hammer the knife through. Be extremely careful: You don't want to cut yourself or have the butternut squash fly across your kitchen.
Gently tap the flat ends of the knife with the mallet, alternating between the tip end and the handle end to move the knife evenly through the squash.

, There is a hole in the center of the bulbous part of the squash. This hole is filled with seeds and pulp. Use a large metal spoon with a thin edges to scrape along the edges of the hole. Remove the seeds and pulp from both halves until the center of the hole is clean and matches the rest of the squash.You can throw the seeds away or rinse the pulp off, toss the seeds with oil and salt, and roast them in the oven.

, Place each squash half cut side down on the cutting board. This will give you stability while you are cutting the squash into cubes., To make your work easier and create more even slices, make a cut across the width of the squash to separate the bulbous section from the top section.You will now have 4 sections of butternut squash, 2 long narrow halves and 2 shorter, more bulbous halves.

, Using your chef’s knife, make cuts one inch apart along the length of each section. Do this for all four sections of the squash., Some sections of the squash will be deeper than one inch. Take these section and lie them on their sides. Cut them in half to create long strips of squash that have the width of a square inch.You can stack several pieces when making this cut, allowing you to cut several strips at one time.

, Lay several 1 inch strips next to each other on your cutting board, then stack more strips on top of those ones. Make a cross cut every inch of the strips to create one inch square cubes.You should get 4 cups of cubes from a one and a half pound butternut squash.

Cut your slices into four strips lengthwise.,
Turn your bread horizontally.,
Cut into four more strips.",How to Cube Bread1," The serrated edges of a bread knife will have an easier time slicing through the bread. If you do not have a bread knife, use a steak knife or other tool with a serrated edge.Although you can use a straight edge in a pinch, straight edges have a habit of tearing into bread, instead of cutting.;
, Place one slice of bread on top of the other. Doing two pieces at a time will cut down on time without sacrificing the appearance of the cubes.This is best done with fresh bread, as stale bread may break or flake too easily.

, Placing your knife about one half-inch in (1.27 cm) from the edge of the crust, begin cutting your bread into four strips lengthwise. Place the knife one half-inch from each edge to keep a clean, uniform shape.

, Once you have your four strips, turn your bread to a horizontal position. Straighten any strips that have gone askew--again, cutting as cleanly as possible to maintain a consistent shape.

, Once more placing your knife one half-inch in (1.27 cm) from the edge, cut your bread into four more strips. You should have 16 cubes at this point, each of them uniform in shape and size.A 16-cube piece assumes you are using a standard size bread loaf.

Mix in the potatoes, rosemary, garlic, salt, and pepper.,
Roast the potatoes in the oven until they are golden and crisp.,
Serve the potatoes while still warm.",How to Cube Potatoes3," To ensure that the oven is hot enough to roast the potatoes, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 425°F (220°C) and allow it to fully heat., Add 3 pounds (1.4 kg) of waxy potatoes that have been cubed to a large pot. Cover the potatoes with cold water and mix in some kosher salt to taste. Heat the potatoes over medium-high until they come to a boil, which should take approximately 7 to 10 minutes.








Yukon gold, red, and new potatoes are good options to use for this dish.
If you prefer, you can omit the salt.
The potatoes should only be slightly tender when you take them off the heat.

, Once the water comes to a boil, immediately pour the potatoes into a colander to drain them. Allow the potatoes to sit in the colander for 2 to 3 minutes so the steam helps them dry out.







, For the roasted potatoes, you’ll need 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary. Pull the leaves off the stems, and use a mortar and pestle to bash them up slightly to release their flavor and aroma.








If you don’t have a mortar and pestle, you can use the back of a spoon to bash up the rosemary leaves.

, Place a large roasting pan on your stove, and add ¼ cup (59 ml) of olive oil. Allow the oil to heat over medium high heat until it begins to shimmer, which should take 3 to 5 minutes.








You can substitute butter for the olive oil if you prefer.

, Once the oil is hot, remove the roasting pan from the heat. Stir in potatoes, rosemary leaves, 5 cloves of minced garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. Toss well until the potatoes are well coated with the mixture.








Feel free to add whatever other herbs or seasonings that you’d like. Thyme, oregano, parsley, dill, and/or crushed red pepper flakes are tasty options.

, When the potatoes are coated with the oil mixture, place the roasting pan in the preheated oven. Allow the potatoes to cook for 30 to 35 minutes, or until they are golden and crispy., When the potatoes are finished roasting, remove the pan from the oven. Transfer them to a serving bowl or platter, and serve them as a side while they’re still warm.The roasted potatoes are an ideal side for roast chicken, pork tenderloin, or your favorite steak.

Then, remove the pot from the heat., Remove about five chestnuts at a time with the strainer. You can work with up to ten chestnuts at a time, but you should start with a smaller amount until you feel comfortable with the technique., Wrap the hot chestnuts in a thick, clean towel. Use your hands to work the towel over the chestnuts. Rub with the towel for a few minutes. The skins should begin to peel off., Put on rubber gloves. Any type of clean, unused rubber gloves will work. Working one at time, rub the chestnut until the skin begins to peel off. The skins should peel of easily if they have been boiled enough."

Holding it firmly, use a serrated knife to make a long cut on the rounded top of the chestnut. Try to make the cut in one motion. The cut should be horizontal and penetrate all the way through the shell.If you can’t make the cut in one motion, use a gentle sawing motion.

, Place the chestnuts in a small saucepan once all of them have been cut. Do not layer them on top of each other. Cover the chestnuts in water., Allow the water to simmer. Then, remove the chestnuts with a strainer before the water begins to boil.You can also use a slotted spoon to remove the chestnuts.

, Transfer the chestnuts from the strainer to a baking sheet. Roast them in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. You may need to leave them in a little longer if the skins haven’t peeled back after 15 minutes., After taking the chestnuts out of the oven, put them in a bowl. Cover the bowl with a towel. Let the chestnuts sit for 15 minutes.The steam created in the covered bowl will make the chestnuts easier to peel.

, After 15 minutes, you should be able easily peel off the shells and skins with your hands. Some of the chestnuts may be slightly more difficult than others to peel. Throw out any chestnuts that are gooey or have disintegrated inside."

Grab a large bread knife.,
Slice the loaf into four to six strips lengthwise.,
Cut each strip in half.,
Cut each new piece into strips.,
Cut the remaining strips into half-inch cubes.",How to Cube Bread2," Although a small bread knife--also called a serrated knife--will work fine for a few slices of bread, you will need a large bread knife (five inches or more(12.7 cm or more)) to successfully cut an entire loaf in one sitting.

, Rather than cutting one or two slices of bread into strips, cut an entire loaf into strips the length of the loaf. This will expedite the cubing process so you are not cutting an entire loaf slice by slice.

, Once your have your lengthwise strips, cut them in half to make the loaf easier to handle. You can cut them in half lengthwise and again from top to bottom, or you can only cut them once lengthwise--whichever makes handling the bread easier for you., Once you have your smaller, more manageable chunks of bread, begin cutting these into slices. They should be roughly the length of your fingers, and a half-inch (1.27 cm) wide.

, Turn your strips horizontal, and cut them into half-inch (1.27 cm) cubes, making sure the knife has completely sliced through the bread each time.

Finished.

",How to Cube Bread3," Tear your bread into small pieces, trying to keep them as close to one-inch squares as possible. Although the edges will be somewhat jagged and uneven, you still want the cubes to be the same basic size.

, When you tear, tear all of the crust first before moving onto the inside of the bread. This will help keep the bread pieces the same basic size, and will give you a better idea if you are getting off track.

, One easy way to keep your bread cubes the same size is to use the pad of your thumb as a measuring tool. Press your thumb against the bread and tear around the width of your thumb.

, To give yourself a better chance of uniformity, aim for 16-18 cubes per piece of bread. Like knife cubing, you can do multiple pieces of bread at once to save time.

Hold the knife correctly.,
Start cutting at a corner of the chocolate.,
Rotate the chocolate as you chop to make it easier.,
Go back and chop again if necessary.",How to Chop Chocolate1," The type of chocolate depends on what you’re making, and what type of chocolate you like. You can choose from dark, milk, or white chocolate. Chocolate can be bought at almost any grocery store. Keep in mind that some types of chocolate are easier to chop than others.Chocolates with a higher percentage of cocoa butter and milk solids are easier to chop than unsweetened chocolate.;
, Make sure you have made a clear space in your kitchen. Choose a stable cutting board. A dry, plastic cutting board is the best choice. A wooden cutting board works perfectly fine if it is very dry. Put the cutting board on a table or counter on your kitchen. Place the chocolate on a cutting board.Wooden chopping boards are more prone to contain moisture, which you want to avoid when chopping chocolate.

, You will need to use a long bladed the knife. You need to use this type of knife because it will provide room to chop the chocolate, and provide protection for your fingers. A serrated knife is recommended if you want your chocolate to be finely chopped. A chef’s knife is a better choice for larger chunks of chocolate, though it will work if you want a finer chop too., Firmly grab the knife handle in the hand you favor. To have more control over the knife, place your hand on top of the dull side of the blade as you cut. You should place your hand towards the end of the knife, but not at the point. To chop, use the part of the blade closest to the handle for the most force.You should use one hand to hold the handle, and the other handle to exert force.

, Chopping chocolate is easier if you start at the edges and cut at an angle. Choose any corner to start from. Begin chopping as finely or as chunky as you desire. Rock the blade from from point to hilt as you begin to chop.For a fine chop, you should begin chopping only a few millimeters at a time.

, Turn the knife towards you in a semi-circle as you chop. Continue chopping the chocolate until you have made it all the way through the block or bar. There should not be any large chunks of chocolate left when you are done.Using the part of the knife closest to the handle gives you more control.
Depending on the size and type of chocolate, cutting it might take some arm strength.

, Look over the chopped chocolate to see if you are satisfied with how fine or chunky it was chopped. If you are not satisfied, repeat the chopping process until the chocolate is the way you want it. You do not have to start at a corner or rotate while you chop this time since it is no longer in one piece.Once it is finished, you can put the chocolate into a bowl to weigh for the recipe. Make sure to subtract the weight of the bowl.

, This is also referred to as seltzer water and carbonated water. Making soda water can be done through fermentation using yeast and sugar (as demonstrated in How to Make Cream Soda), but the most effective, efficient and inexpensive way is through forced carbonation using a rechargeable siphon, as shown in the video below. You can buy these from Amazon, cooking utensil stores such as Williams-Sonoma, eBay vendors and other sources. Be careful of used siphons; see the Warnings below., Most siphons use a standard 8 gram CO2 cartridge. You can get them from the same sources for new siphons, or from mail and online vendors. Stay away from Chinese-made soda charger cartridges, as they have been known to impart a bad taste to the resulting carbonated water due to the use of low-quality CO2 gas. , Follow the manufacturer instructions. Siphons should not be filled to the very top. If your tap water does not taste good, neither will the resulting soda water; use filtered or bottled water for best results. Use cold water, or cool the siphon in the refrigerator before using. Warm soda water does not taste good!, Follow the manufacturer's directions and do not overcharge (see the Warnings below)., Usually a tenth of the volume of the glass will do., Be gentle when pressing the siphon's trigger, or else the soda water will come out very fast and spill all over the place.

One can be purchased on Amazon, or at a culinary supply store. It looks similar to a tiny pitchfork, and it is typically around $5.This is a good method if you find that chopping chocolate with a knife requires too much strength. A chocolate chipper requires less strength and force.
This may only be a worthwhile investment if you will be chopping chocolate enough for the investment to pay off.
Ice picks look similar and can do the same job.

, Make sure you have a clean, open space in your kitchen. You will probably want to work at a kitchen table or counter. Keep a bowl in your area to place the chocolate in if you will be chopping a large amount.Take a kitchen scale and weigh your chocolate to make sure you are using the right amount for your recipe.

, It is likely that little pieces of chocolate will go flying across the room with this method. To prevent this, take a rimmed baking sheet and place it on a damp towel. Then, place your cutting board inside of the baking sheet.Placing the cutting board inside of the baking sheet prevents the chocolate from flying off of the counter of table. The damp paper towel keeps the baking sheet in place.

, Hold the chocolate chipper with both hands, and push it into the chocolate. Start at the edge of the chocolate and wedge the chipper in as close or far apart as you desire as you move through the chocolate. You should make a repeated up and down motion, as if you were stabbing the chocolate.You can go back and use a chef’s knife to cut up the pieces of chocolate if you want it very fine.

, The place where you choose to start and stop chopping the chocolate does not matter. All that matters is that you wedge the chocolate chipper into the chocolate until it is completely chopped up."

Place the chocolate on a countertop or table.,
Choose a tool.,
Whack the chocolate with your tool.,
Cut it up with a knife for an extra fine chop.",How to Chop Chocolate3," It will be easier to hit the chocolate with an object if it is not exposed. Exposed chocolate will likely fly everywhere, so leaving it in packaging will keep it in one place. It’s okay if the chocolate is already out of the packaging. You just need to cover it in plastic wrap.It is also an option to put the chocolate in a jumbo Ziploc bag.

, Make sure the place you plan on hitting the chocolate is sturdy. A weak table or counter may be damaged if it is hit with too much force. You can place the chocolate on top of a cutting board for added protection., There are several tools you can use to hit the chocolate. It is recommended to use a French hardwood rolling pin. You can also use a hammer if you do not have a rolling pin. The tool should not come in direct contact with the chocolate, but make sure it is clean just in case it does.A rock or regular claw hammer with a fiberglass or metal handle is recommended.

, Start by hitting the middle of the chocolate block. Don’t use so much force that you break the surface that the chocolate is on, but don’t use so little force that it does not break it all. Hit the chocolate with your chosen object as many times as necessary until it breaks down to your liking. You should stop hitting the chocolate when it feels like there are no large chunks leftIf you are using a rolling pin, make sure you’ve lined it up to hit the chocolate. Slowly bring the pin down a few times to test it out. The pin can break if it is not properly aligned.
Be mindful of anyone in your area. Do not hit them with the hammer or rolling pin.

, Unwrap the chocolate from its packaging when you are finished hitting it. Observe the chocolate to see how it has been broken up. Go back and chop it with a knife if it is still too chunky for you. Use a serrated knife or chef’s knife. Hold the handle with one hand, and the dull top of the knife with the other. Cut through the chocolate until it is to your liking."

2 tablespoons (30 g) freshly grated ginger root
Juice of one lemon
1/4 teaspoon (1.6 g) fresh granular baker's yeast
Cold, pure water;
, Leave the funnel in place until all the steps are complete and you are ready to cap the bottle.

,, It may stick in the funnel. Don't worry, the next steps will wash it into the bottle.

, Add the rinsing water to the bottle.

, This helps activate the yeast and gets the carbonation process going.

, Leave about an inch of head space, then securely screw the cap down to seal. The head space is necessary to leave room for gasses that will be produced during fermentation. Invert the bottle repeatedly to thoroughly dissolve sugar.


Check the bottom of the bottle because the sugar tends to stick in little pockets there. The ginger root will not dissolve, of course.

, The warmth is necessary for the yeast to be able to ferment the brew. But don't forget about it! Too long and the alcohol concentration starts to increase and the taste changes greatly.

, If it dents in as in the picture, it is not ready; the fermentation produces carbon dioxide (like in sodas and seltzers) that will inflate the bottle and make it difficult to squeeze.

, Refrigerate at least overnight to thoroughly chill before opening. Crack the lid off the cool ginger ale just a little to release the pressure slowly. You do not want a ginger ale fountain!

This will ""invert"" the syrup, which makes it sweeter, helps the sugar dissolve, and increases shelf life.This ingredient goes back to at least 1852, and might be the reason it's called ""cream soda.""Some modern commercial sodas use it as well, so you might be familiar with the taste.There may be some health concerns related to the ""unbounded fructose"" in inverted sugar.Consider asking your doctor first if you have diabetes.

, Simmer over medium-high heat, reducing heat if bubbles are building up above the surface. The mixture is ready when a candy thermometer reads 220ºF (104ºC), or when it's syrupy, brown, and covered in small, thick bubbles.If you don't have a candy thermometer, you might want to take the pan off the heat while the syrup is still clear or light brown, to prevent burning. The lighter the syrup is, the less caramel flavor the soda will have.
Sugar syrup gets dangerously hot. Handle with care and keep away from children.

, Move the pan to another burner and wait for it to cool to a safer temperature.

, This gives the syrup time to absorb the vanilla, which is the main flavor of cream soda.

, When you're ready to drink your soda, stir the syrup into carbonated water (seltzer) and ice. Try 1–2 tbsp syrup per 12 oz glass (15–30mL per 360mL), then experiment to make it as sweet or mild as you like your soda. That's one of the benefits to making it at home!


If you used a real vanilla bean, remove the pod and throw it away. If you dislike the seeds in your drink, strain the syrup through a cheesecloth. (Try it with the seeds first — many people don't mind them, and the cheesecloth will soak up some of your syrup.)
Store extra syrup in the refrigerator. It will usually last at least a week., Most of the time, cream soda doesn't actually contain cream, but a spoonful of cream or half-and-half does give it a nice foam. For the full dessert option, use a spoonful of vanilla ice cream instead.


Since this soda is acidic, there is a chance that the dairy will curdle. Avoid this by pouring slowly and starting with chilled water. Lower-fat products (whole milk or skim milk) are more likely to curdle.

Open 'er up.",How to Make Ginger Ale2," Here's what you'll need to make ginger ale using the stove-top method:


1 1/2 ounces finely grated fresh ginger
3/4 c (6 ounces) sugar
7 1/2 cups (60 ounces) filtered water
1/8 teaspoon (.5 g) active dry yeast
2 tablespoons (30 g) freshly squeezed lemon juice

, Over medium-high heat, add the grated ginger, sugar, and 1/2 cup (4 oz) water together. Stir your concoction until the sugar has dissolved completely. This will take a few minutes, so be patient.

, Place it to the side, cover and allow to steep for 1 hour. Resist the urge to mess with it -- right now your concoction needs uninterrupted time.

, The easiest way to do this will be to pour the syrup through a fine mesh strainer set directly over the bowl. Press down on the bits to get all of the juice out of the mixture. Once you've got as much liquid out as possible, throw the bowl in an ice bath or set in the refrigerator until the concoction reaches room temperature -- 68 to 72°F (20 to 22°C).

, Place it on top of a clean, plastic 2-liter bottle and pour in the syrup. Then, add the yeast, lemon juice and remaining 7 cups of water (56 oz). Twist the cap on the bottle until it's securely on and gently shake to mix everything together. Leave it alone and at room temperature for 48 hours.


But no longer! If you leave it out too long, the taste will start to become too bitter as the yeast ferments.

, Pop open the top and check for the right amount of carbonation. If there seems to be enough, throw that baby in the fridge. If not, wait a little longer.


Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, opening the bottle at least once a day to let out excess carbonation. Otherwise pressure will build up and you risk it exploding.

Let ferment at room temperature.,
Move to the refrigerator.,
Pour the drink carefully.,
Add a dollop of ice cream (optional).",How to Make Cream Soda2," Pour ¼ to ⅓ cup (50–66g) white granulated sugar into a 1 pint (500mL) sterilized bottle. In this recipe, we'll use sugar and yeast to carbonate our own soda.


There is a chance of explosion from any home brewing. A plastic bottle is less sturdy (especially the bottle cap), but less dangerous if it does explode. A glass bottle from a brewing supply store is less likely to explode, but more dangerous.
This is a very small batch compared to most brewing projects, which is good for a first timer who doesn't want to waste ingredients on mishaps. If you've already done some home brewing, you can increase this to a larger batch.

, Pour ½–1 tbsp (7.5–15mL) vanilla extract into the bottle, depending on how strong a flavor you're going for. Vanilla is the main flavor in most cream sodas.

, Heat the water until it reaches a temperature between 95 and 105ºF (35–40ºC).Cold water will not activate the yeast, and hot water will kill it.

, Combine a small pinch of yeast (about 1/16 teaspoon / 0.3mL)) with a little warm water and 2 tsp (30mL) sugar.Cover the mixture and wait about 6–10 minutes, or until you notice foam and a distinct yeast scent. Pour the mixture into the bottle, using a funnel.


You can use baker's yeast in a pinch, but this is not recommended. You may end up with unpredictable amounts of carbonation, or a less pleasant flavor.
You can skip the activation, but the soda will take longer to carbonate.

, Fill the bottle with warm water, leaving 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm) of space at the top. Secure the cap, and shake it until the ingredients have dissolved.

, Leave the bottle in a warm, draft-free location, preferably at 68–77ºF (20–25ºC).Check on it once or twice daily. The soda is ready when the bottle feels hard when squeezed, anywhere from 12–72 hours. If you didn't activate the yeast, this usually takes at least 48 hours.


Leaving it at room temperature too long can generate enough pressure to explode the bottle! This is especially true at high temperature or if using old yeast.

, Place bottle in refrigerator (below 40ºF/5ºC) for 24-48 hours to stop fermentation and let the yeast settle. Try to put it in a part of the refrigerator that isn't subject to temperature fluctuations (towards the back, away from the door). Try not to agitate the bottle at all.

, Pick up the bottle slowly, to avoid disturbing the sediment at the bottom. Pour into a new bottle or a glass, leaving the last bit of sediment-filled liquid at the bottom of the bottle. Mixing that portion into your drink can lead to an overpowering yeasty taste.

, You can drink your cream soda plain, or mix it with ice cream for dessert.

This will be slightly different than a regular mimosa drink, but can add a gingery tang guests may enjoy., Sparkling cider is sold in a variety of flavors, such as apple and pear. If you want your mimosa to have a sweeter, fruitier taste, opt for a sparkling cider in your choice of flavor., You can go for classic orange juice for your mimosa. However, there are other juice options you can try. Things like grapefruit juice can be used for a slightly more bitter mimosa. You can also try the subtle sweetness of peach juice. Some mimosas use unique flavors of juices, such as passion fruit juice or mango juice., Make sure you account for what you're pairing the juice with. Apple juice may not blend well with carbonated apple cider, for example, as the taste will be overpowering. Instead, try something like apple juice paired with ginger ale."

Hold a Roman banquet.",How to Cook Like a Roman," If possible, set up your food storage so that Roman foods and non-Roman foods are stored on different shelves to make it easier for you. Stock up on the following important Roman staples:


Olives and olive oil. Pliny the Elder sang the virtues of the olive by claiming that: ""Except the vine, there is no plant which bears a fruit of as great importance as the olive"". Buy ""pure"" olive oil for cooking and ""extra virgin"" for flavoring uncooked things;

Honey. Use this instead of sugar. Or, you can also use dates to sweeten dishes;
Chickpeas (also known as ""garbanzo beans"") and lentils;
Whole grains and whole grain flour such as ""emmer"", ""spelt"" or ""far"" (kinds of wheat) and barley. Emmer and spelt are available in ""health food"" stores. Emmer is a very ancient variety of wheat and is the most authentic choice for early Roman cooking. Rye was also consumed by the Romans;
Salt;
Vegetables such as radishes, parsnips, carrots, cabbage, leek, endive, celery, globe artichokes, cucumber, gourds, lettuce, onions. pennycress, nettles, asparagus and beets;Fruit such as grapes, raisins, currants, sultanas, figs, dates, medlar, mulberry, damson, plums, cultivated cherry, apples, pears, crab apple, raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, and elder berries;Many herbs and spices such as oregano, dill, mustard, lovage, rosemary, rue, sage, sweet marjoram, thyme, aniseed, borage, black pepper, poppy seeds, fennel, mint, flat parsley, garlic, and savory;Nuts include walnut, almond, chestnuts, and stone pine;Meat in the form of chicken, mutton, or pork (and ham, bacon, sucking pigs) was far more common than beef, although beef was supplied as rations to Roman garrisons in Britain and was much enjoyed in Roman Britain;wildfowl was common, such as duck and goose, and wealthy Romans also ate other birds we're less likely to eat nowadays, such as swan, stork, flamingo, and crane;rabbit, hare, and deer would also have been consumed by Romans;
Fungi (edible mushrooms);
Snails and frogs (the French weren't there first!);
Seafood including many types of fish (eel, perch, pike, carp, etc.), crustaceans, and shellfish was very popular;
Several sauces, including garum (a fish sauce similar to that used in Thai and Vietnamese cooking) or fermented fish sauce (liquamen); oenogarum was fish sauce mixed with wine. See ""Tips"" to learn how the Romans made fish sauce. Try a modern fermented fish condiment, such as mild Worcestershire sauceor chopped stronger, saltier anchovies.
Cheese both hard and soft was made by Romans. Ricotta and feta are two very suitable types;
Wine (cooking and drinking) and vinegar. Vinegar added a sharp taste to sauces, preserved fruits, vegetables, and fish. The Romans also brewed beer.;
, Some common non-Roman foods that you should not use in authentic Roman dishes are these foods from the Americas: tomatoes, potatoes, chilies, corn (maize). Except for white cabbage, all cruciferous vegetables, including broccoli, cauliflower and brussels sprouts, are post-medieval vegetables. Pasta (except lasagna) also was not known to the Romans.

, By the time of the Romans, cooking equipment had become far more complex than previous cooking cultures.Cooking was done over a raised brick hearth with a charcoal fire. While some foods such as meat or fish could be grilled direct on the charcoals, other food had to be cooked in tripod pots over the coals. In addition, it is likely that the Romans used steaming methods. Baking and roasting was also done in an oven using wood or charcoal as fuel.Naturally, your modern day oven and stove will be perfect substitutes. As for your cooking equipment, the extent of the authenticity is up to you but here are some common Roman items and possible substitutes:


Use a good, large mortar and pestle (mortaria). This is your Roman style food processor. A marble one is best because it will not pick up flavors from such common ingredients as garlic. Naturally, if you're feeling lazy, the Romans would probably have snapped up food processors in the blink of an eye, so don't hesitate!
Use a pizza stone for baking.
Use a large pot for stews. The Romans used iron cauldrons but there's a good reason we don't tend to anymore – they're heavy! A large casserole can also be used as a Roman oven.
Use a frying pan (fretale or sartago) for cooking fish and frying vegetables. A patella was used as a slightly deeper frying pan that could also be taken to the table, and the patina was an even deeper pan for more complex dishes. Perhaps use such items as paella pans and casserole dishes without lids for substitutes.
Use jugs and pitchers (amphorae) for storing and pouring your olive oil, wine, and other liquids. Naturally, a measuring jug is also perfectly acceptable as a modern-day substitute.
Roman knives, strainers, pots, and pans were generally similar to our modern day ones, so it's likely your kitchen is already well-equipped for Roman cooking.

, The cooking methods include: baking, roasting, steaming, raw (salads), frying in oil, and heating. Grain could be milled, so flour for baking and sauces is permissible (amulum thickened sauces), as well as ground grain dishes such as porridge and gruel (pulse or pulmentus). If you're really keen, look for your own flour mill to grind the flour fresh at home. Although extra work, the freshness can make it worth your while. Bread was common but there are different types: autopyron was a slave and dog bread made from mostly bran with a little flour; athletae was unleavened bread mixed with soft curd cheese; buccellatum was the troop's staple dry biscuit; and artophites was light leavened bread made from the best flour baked in a mold., Several ancient writers left collections of recipes, but they are really hard to use. Some good modern interpretations of Roman cookbooks are listed below. Try making some of the following:



Libum (like cheese bread) or moretum (a garlic and vegetable cheese spread) to start.

Cooked mussels, prawn cake, and oyster omelet

Seared fish
Grilled pork chop using a dry method
Cooked chicken

Roman sweet cake and honey cakes.

, Serving the food was a little different from nowadays, where fingers are relegated to fast food and nibbles, while table food requires the use of modern utensils. In Roman times, eating food with the fingers was far more common and napkins were an essential for wiping dirty fingers. Romans had knives and spoons but they lacked forks.It's up to you how far you wish to live without your fork! Once again, no doubt Romans would have embraced the fork if they'd thought of it first. Spoons were used for sauces and soft food, with a small spoon known as a cocleare used for removing shellfish from shells.It is also likely that larger spoons served as ladles. Solid foods were eaten using the fingers.


Romans had bowls, plates, cups, finger bowls, jugs, goblets, and wine ladles.
Items were typically made from a range of materials including pottery, glass, silver, bronze, iron, pewter, etc. You may wish to research further if you're trying to achieve an authentic table look along with your Roman food.

, Romans adored their wine, so feel free to add wine to your meal.In Roman times, it was considered bad manners to drink wine undilutedbut you might want to ignore that nicety given the care taken in making modern day wines ""just right"", or you can even try making mulsum. And the other drinks? Posca and water. That makes the choice easy!

, Romans were renowned for banqueting. Once your Roman cooking skills have broadened, consider holding a mini-banquet for your family and friends, to introduce them to the delights and healthy aspects of eating like a Roman.


Bear in mind the presentation was a very important aspect of a successful banquet. Place candelabra on the table, use your best dinnerware, and add some fresh flowers to the dining room (triclinium) for beauty.
Romans would often recline to eat, placing three couches around the table.So, you have a good excuse to pull the couches up to a low lying table and to chill out as you enjoy your Roman banquet.

Be careful eating when reclined or drinking alcohol, and don't combine the two: each increases the risk of choking. Recline sideways, not straight back. Don't stain your seat: put something over it or avoid messy food.


Guests would be expected to bring their own dining napkins with them; at the end of the evening, they'd fill their napkins with leftovers to take home as what you might perceive as a sort of an eco-friendly Tupperware equivalent!"

Pour some water into a large bowl, up to a gallon.,
Add 3/4 cup of salt for every gallon of water.,
Add sugar to the water.,
Add any other desired seasonings to the brine.,
Boil your brine mixture before adding chicken if you have added seasonings.,
Place the chicken into the brining solution.,
Place the brine in the refrigerator and let it soak.,
Remove the chicken from the brine.",How to Brine Chicken1," The bowl will need to be large enough to submerge all of the chicken you are cooking, but also able to fit into your refrigerator. Fill the bowl with enough water to cover the chicken completely. Consider using warm water as you will be dissolving some solids into solution., All brine contains salt, as it is necessary to force the water into the meat's cells. The amount of salt used can vary greatly, but start by adding 3/4 cup of kosher salt per gallon of water (46 ml of salt per liter of water). Stir the salt into the water to dissolve it.

, Sugar, while not required in a brine, is a useful ingredient to brown the skin. Adding sugar to a brine will increase the amount of caramelization achieved when cooking the chicken, regardless of cooking method. Try adding the same amount of sugar as salt. You can use any type of sugar, including white, brown, turbinado, or even molasses or honey. Stir the water to dissolve the sugar.

, You can also add other ingredients to your brine to season the chicken. Peppercorns, fresh herbs, and fruit juices are all options for seasoning a brine. Some great ingredients to mix and match include:


Add aromatics such as: 2-4 cloves of garlic (crushed with a knife), bay leaves, a handful thyme, sage, or rosemary sprigs, 2-3 tablespoons uncracked peppercorns, parsley, juice from 1-2 large lemons or oranges, bay leaves, or 1-2 tablespoons of mustard, cumin, or coriander seeds.Beer and Tyme Brine: Mix 4 12-ounce cans beer (lager, like Budweiser), 1 cup kosher salt, 3/4 cup light-brown sugar, Small handful of thyme sprigs, 5 bay leaves, 1 tablespoon cracked black pepper, and 6 cups ice in a large saucepot.

Rosemary Lemon Brine: 1 small onion, thinly sliced, 4 garlic cloves, smashed with the flat side of a knife, 1 teaspoon vegetable oil, 1 cup Kosher salt, 5 or 6 branches rosemary, 1 liter water, juice of 1 lemon.

, Otherwise, the flavors won't penetrate the chicken. Add all ingredients (salt, sugar, water, seasonings etc) and bring to a boil for approximately 1 minute. Allow to cool completely before moving on.

, Make sure that the chicken is fully submerged in the brine. You can use a brine for either a whole chicken or for smaller pieces of chicken; the process is the same either way.

, Place the entire bowl into the refrigerator, covering it with plastic wrap. Let the chicken soak in the brining solution for several hours. For small pieces, 1 or 2 hours is sufficient, while 8 to12 hours is ideal for a whole chicken. If you can't spare that much time, a brine will still impart flavor and improve tenderness if used for only a short period of time, at least 2 hours.Never brine chicken at room temperature, as this can lead to bacteria growth.

, Take the chicken out of the brining solution and pat off the excess water before cooking. Dispose of the brining solution by pouring it down the drain.

Know that dry brines keep your chicken flavorful and the skin extra crispy.,
Pat the chicken dry.,
Mix your dry brine in a small bowl before applying.,
Massage the salt evenly into every side of the chicken.,
Cover the chicken and let it refrigerate between 2 and 24 hours.,
Remove the chicken and pat it dry.",How to Brine Chicken2," While wet brines are the traditional way to prep a roast chicken, many chefs are starting to experiment with dry brines instead, which lead to a more robust texture. The salt draws out moisture, which dissolves the salt into a thin, natural wet brine that the chicken then reabsorbs.Use course sea salt or kosher whenever possible for a dry brine. Fine-grained salts, like table salt, will coat too much of the chicken, dissolve too quickly, and make the final roast taste too salty.

, Use a paper towel to get as much moisture off the outside of the chicken as you can. You do not have to rub it down or squeeze water out, a simple pat-down will do.

, Dry brines are simply massaged into the chicken and are made almost completely of salt. That said, you can mix in other spices and flavors as well. Start with roughly 1 teaspoon of Kosher salt for every pound of chicken you have (4lb chicken, 4 teaspoons salt), then add any of the following spices that you want:


2 tsp cracked black pepper.
1 tsp paprika, chili powder, or cayenne
1 tsp rosemary or thyme
1-2 tsp garlic powder

, Rub the top, bottom, inside, and outside of the chicken with your dry brine. Use a little extra salt on thicker parts, like thighs and breasts.


You want an even, generous coating of salt. The whole chicken shouldn't be coated in salt, but there should be a fair amount of kernels on everything.
You may need an extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt to complete the brine.

, The longer you let the chicken brine, the better the results. Still, if you are in a hurry then you should see some results after two hours.


Aim for an overnight brining, at the very least. Two hours will work, but it will not be incredibly effective. The longer you let your chicken brine, the better. Try not to exceed 24 hours, however.

, There should not be much excess moisture on the chicken, and all the salt should be dissolved. Still, pat down any extra moisture or wet areas with a paper towel if you see them. When you're done you're ready to get the chicken in the oven and add any extra flavors.


Try stuffing lemon wedges, garlic gloves, and springs of herbs in the chest cavity or between the legs and wings for added flavors.

Think of food ingredients as musical instruments.,
Think of yourself as the maestro, conducting the performance.,
Add certain sounds (flavors) with certain instruments (ingredients).,
Play instruments at the right volume.,
Remember that presentation is important!,
Enjoy the music!",How to Approach Cooking Like Making Music," Each ingredient in a dish that you are preparing is an individual instrument. Some play small parts, such as some exotic spices like cardamom and cumin. Some play larger parts, such as base spices like salt and pepper. Others play supporting roles in the performance, such as annatto, a spice that is used to add color. The main component of a dish, such as fish, meat or fowl, is the principal performer. Veggies and other things around it can be thought of as the chorus that adds depth to the performance.;
, If you have ever attended a classical concert, you know that before the actual performance, the musicians warm up, tune their instruments and generally make noise. Think of this as your prep time, before the concert, when you are gathering ingredients; cutting, slicing and dicing them, and so on. However, once the concert begins, you must lead the performers so that they play in the correct order, at the correct time. If you don't do a good job, you will hear noise. When you do it correctly, the result is music!

, For example, you can think of salt as a bass drum. Black pepper could be a mandolin, oregano an Italian tenor, basil a clarinet, tomato a bassoon and rosemary a snare drum.

, The proportions of ingredients need to be balanced according to how weak or powerful they may be. Salt is a strong instrument, if you play it loudly by adding a lot of it to a dish, it will overpower everything else and will ""sound"" unpleasant to the senses. With some spices it is easy to understand the correct proportions, but as you experiment with new ones you may need to start by playing the instrument softly and increasing the volume a bit at a time.

, A big part of the performance in a concert is the visuals. Classical orchestras do not perform in jeans and t-shirts, and they usually pick clothing in a specific color scheme. The person ""hearing"" your performance will taste it as much with their eyes as with their other senses. A messy plate will not be nearly as appealing as a colorful, well-presented and organized one.

, In the end, cooking is very much like music, because the preparation for the concert usually takes much longer than the actual performance. However, it is the performance that should leave enjoyable memories in the mind of the person hearing it. Enjoy the food, and next time, try playing the music a little differently. Once in a while, don't be afraid to pick up a different score and play something entirely different!

Consider butterflying the meat for crispier skin and moister breast meat.,
Preheat your oven to 500°F with a rack in the middle of the oven.,
Add any aromatics you want to the chicken.,
Place the chicken in the oven, basting every 10-12 minutes.,
Cook the chicken for 45 minutes, or until a meat thermometer in the breast reads 150°F.,
Let the chicken stand before cutting into it.",How to Brine Chicken3," Roast chickens are notoriously hard to keep moist, especially where the breast meat is concerned. Butterflying is when you cut and split the chicken, providing a more even cooking surface for optimum crispiness. This is best done before brining, but can be done afterward as well. To butterfly a whole chicken:


Use a sharp knife or kitchen shears to cut out the spine of the chicken. This is the long bone in the center of the chicken on the opposite side as the breast meat.
Place the chicken breast-side up on a cutting board.
Use the heel of your hand to press straight into the center of the breastbone. You'll hear a crack and the chicken will flatten down.
Lightly brush the entire top surface with olive oil., Make sure there are no other racks above the middle one. Get out a roasting or baking pan and place your chicken in the center.

, Aromatics, like herbs and lemon, add flavor to your roast. Squeeze the juice of a large lemon on the chicken, add sprigs of rosemary or thyme between the wings and thighs, or crack some black pepper on top of the breasts.


If the chicken is whole, stuff lemon slices, garlic cloves, and herbs into the cavity in the middle of the chicken to your liking.

, Basting is taking the hot oil and juice from the pan and spreading them on top of the chicken. This helps the chicken stay moist and gets the skin nice and crispy. Use a baster or a cooking brush to reapply the liquid from the pan on the chicken. Try not to leave the oven open for too long as you work -- this causes the heat to drop too quickly and slows cooking.

, Breast meat is best at this temperature, and thigh meat needs to be 170°F to be safe. If the outsides start to darken before the insides are fully cooked, lower the oven temperature to 450°F.

, You need to let the chicken rest, otherwise all the juice will leave the meat when you cut into it. Set the chicken aside on a cutting board and tent it loosely with aluminum foil. After 5-6 minutes, you can remove the foil, cut into the chicken, and start eating.

Consult the sell-by/use-by date.,
Pour vinegar into a large open container.,
Shake in a small amount of baking soda.,
Watch for the baking soda to react.,
Use baking soda up to 3 years after you open it.,
Keep your baking soda in a cool, dry place.,
Leave the package sealed until you need it.,
Avoid exposing the baking soda to moisture.",How to Know if Baking Soda Is Still Good," Baking soda does not actually spoil like other foods. When it gets old, however, it loses some of its strength and may no longer work as a leavening agent.To get a general sense of whether your baking soda is still good, look for the sell-by or use-by date on the package. Baking soda tends to work best when used before this date.Baking soda does not have an expiration date listed on the package, as it has an indefinite shelf life. Do not look for an expiration date on baking soda, as you cannot find one.
You may still be able to use baking soda past the sell-by or use-by date, as these are just rough estimates. You can use vinegar to test your baking soda's freshness if the use-by or sell-by date has passed.;
, Add roughly three tablespoons of vinegar to a small container. You will be adding baking soda to the vinegar to see if it fizzles. Make sure to choose a bigger container. If the vinegar fizzles, you do not want it to spill on your counter.A measuring cup or mixing bowl works well for this test., You’ll only need to add about a quarter teaspoon of baking soda to the acid to find out whether it’s still good. Dump in all your baking soda into the vinegar., Fresh baking soda will begin to bubble and froth as soon as it comes into contact with the vinegar. If it bubbles slowly or not at all, the baking soda is no longer fresh.If there’s any doubt about whether or not a particular batch of baking soda is still good, it’s usually safest just to pick up a fresh package.

, If your baking soda passes the vinegar test, estimate its shelf life. Unopened baking soda lasts indefinitely, but once you open your baking soda it will start to lose its strength.Most baking sodas last around three years after being opened., Baking soda should be stored somewhere with a mild, consistent temperature. A normal pantry or cupboard is the best option, but it may also be okay in a covered jar on the countertop. Excess heat or cold or drastic changes in temperature can weaken baking soda.Store your baking soda away from the oven, stovetop or broiler.

, Baking soda starts to lose power as soon as it's opened. Do not open baking soda prematurely. Keep the container sealed until it's necessary to use your baking soda.After opening your baking soda, consider transferring it to another lidded container such as a condiment jar or piece of Tupperware. This will protect it from exposure and let you get more use out of it., Steamy kitchens or humid earthen cellars are not the best environment for baking soda. To prevent moisture from ruining your baking soda, keep it covered and store it a safe distance away from sinks and other water sources.Measure out the baking soda you need for a given recipe, then put the package away rather than leaving it to sit out.
Clumping is a clear sign that moisture has ruined your baking soda. Clumped baking soda should be replaced.

Be knowledgeable about the foods you're foraging.,
Be considerate.,
Dress appropriately.,
Take along adequate containers.,
Get into a regular routine.",How to Forage for Food in the Fall1," Above all, it's very important that you're absolutely certain that you're collecting food that is edible and safe. Mushrooms can be deadly if they're not the edible kind as many are poisonous, and the best avoidance of ending up with a poisonous look alike mushroom is doing a spore print ( Spore Print! ).
Select the wrong chestnut and you've got yourself something entirely inedible and unpleasant. Even not knowing whether or not foods have been sprayed for weed control is important if you want to avoid pesticides and poisons.
If you don't know whether or not a food you find in the wild is safe, the advice is to not collect or eat it.
Alternatively, you could ask for local advice from people who do know or go along with an expert forager who is well versed in what's safe and delicious to forage for in your area. David Fischer has a great mushroom and edible guide or the National Audubon Society has several guides as well.


If a nut is damaged, has been bitten by a squirrel or other animal, or has been broken in the fall from its tree, smash it and leave it for the birds and squirrels. It should not be used for food.
A plant identification guide can be helpful. However, even with this it is not always clear and local knowledge may be the only assurance when you're comparing photos with the foods you've gathered.
Avoid foraging where there is likely to be contamination from traffic, pollution or agricultural run-off. This means being particularly careful around streams, roadsides and near industrial sites. Also consider that certain edibles are good to eat if grown on certain vegetation, like the sulfur shelf mushroom is ok grown on certain trees, but not on others.

, As well as ensuring that the food is safe and good to eat, ensure that it's legal to collect the food from the places you're going to and that it's free-for-all. If you're rummaging through a local farmer's produce, they're not going to be too happy and if they catch you, you could be prosecuted for trespassing and theft.
Where food is abundant and freely available, don't be a hog; only take what you need and can use and leave plenty for other foragers and for the animals that need these foods to survive.
Eat prolific species and be sure to leave endangered species well alone. If possible, follow the mantra of ""take half, leave half"" so that the plants continue to grow and reproduce. Obtain permission from the owner of the land before gathering food items from land that is owned privately. The rules on entering land vary depending on your jurisdiction and some countries are more tied up in private ownership than others, so it pays to know your rights with respect to roaming around private and public lands.
There are some good websites outlining the laws relevant to foraging, so take a moment to read them.

, If the weather is cool, be sure to dress warmly; at this time of year layering can be helpful to enable you to cool down or warm up quickly, dependent on weather changes.


Wear good walking shoes as you may encounter mud, prickles, animals and the like. It's always a good idea to have gloves to protect your hands from thorns, stains, allergic reactions and beasts that might be lurking where you're sticking your hands.
You may find it helpful to carry a cane or walking stick. This can be used to maintain balance and to poke about to find food or to measure depth before treading somewhere that isn't clear.
The warmer part of the day is around 12:30pm to 2:30pm or choose days when it's not raining and the sun is guaranteed to be shining. In early fall this won't be such an issue but as the season progresses and the cooler weather sets in, you'll be more comfortable foraging when it's warmer.

, Take along suitable items for holding the food, such as baskets, buckets, bowls or plastic bags. Plastic bags can be easily folded up and placed into your pockets, making it possible to carry more foods as you find them.


If you can, take a bike. This will allow you to cover greater distances and also provides an excellent source of carrying food if you add a pannier or similar carry item.

, If you're only going foraging as a one-off, then it's likely you're just trying it out for fun. However, if you're serious about stocking your winter larder or about eating fresh foods from nature regularly through fall, then you'll need to be out checking every few days.
Try to go out every two to three days to find newly fallen nuts, ripened fruits and ready-to-pick seeds and herbs. You can cultivate areas of naturally occurring produce throughout the year.


When you get started in foraging, simply try noticing what wild foods are about you as you're walking through the woods, fields and local countryside. A big part of foraging for wild food is learning to spot it and knowing what can be taken and eaten from specific locations.

Make a broccoli bouquet.,
Wrap your broccoli in damp paper towels.,
Keep your broccoli in a ventilated bag.,
Wash homegrown broccoli, but not store-bought broccoli.,
Get your broccoli in the fridge as quick as possible.",How to Keep Broccoli Fresh1," One unconventional but surprisingly effective way to keep your broccoli fresh is similar to the way you might keep a selection of flowers in a bouquet bright and lively. Simply put your head of broccoli, stem down, into a bowl with a half inch or so of water at the bottom. The ""bushy"" part of the broccoli (the head) should point up, out of the bowl. Refrigerate. Storing your broccoli this way should keep it fresh for about five to seven days.For optimum freshness, cover the broccoli head loosely with a plastic bag containing a few holes so that air can pass through. Change the water daily.;
, Another option for keeping your broccoli fresh mimics the freshening effect of the automatic misters you may have seen in your grocery store's produce section. Fill a clean, empty spray bottle (one that hasn't previously been filled with bleach or other caustic cleaning products) with cold water, then gently mist your broccoli's heads. Loosely wrap the heads with a paper towel so that the towel absorbs some of the moisture. Keep the broccoli in the fridge. It should remain fresh for about three days.Don't wrap the broccoli too tightly with the paper towels and don't keep it in a sealed container. Broccoli needs air flow to stay fresh.

, If you don't have the time or patience for the methods above, don't worry — it's easy to keep your broccoli reasonably fresh with nothing more than an ordinary plastic bag. Simply seal your broccoli in the bag, then poke numerous holes in the bag near the broccoli's head to ensure good air flow. Keep the broccoli refrigerated. The broccoli should stay fresh for at least a few days with this method.

, When it comes to storing broccoli, a little moisture can be a good thing, but excess moisture can be quite bad. Wetness can promote mold growth in as little as a few days, making a perfectly good head of broccoli inedible. For this reason, you'll want to avoid washing fresh broccoli that you buy from the store, as this has already been washed and dried and thus requires no additional cleaning. However, you will want to wash broccoli that you grow yourself to remove tiny insects and debris from the garden. After washing your homegrown broccoli, be sure to dry it thoroughly to prevent mold.


To wash homegrown broccoli, mix warm (not hot) water and a few teaspoons of white vinegar in a large bowl. Soak the broccoli for about 15 minutes to kill any small bugs and remove any debris that may be hiding in the plant's tightly-packed florets. Remove, rinse with cool water, and dry thoroughly before refrigerating., Regardless of how you choose to store your broccoli, one thing will always be the same — you'll want to get it into the fridge as soon as you can. Some sources recommend that even fresh store-bought broccoli should make it into the refrigerator within 30 minutes of purchase.The quicker your broccoli gets into the fridge, the less of a chance it will have to begin to lose its firm, crisp texture and the longer it will last before going bad.

Prepare foods before eating or cooking with them.,
Go mushroom picking.,
Collect apples.,
Find wild fruits such as plums, crab apples and persimmons.,
Pick berries.,
Gather nuts and seeds.,
Look for herbs and greens.,
Enjoy the bounty of your rose bushes.,
Go hunting.",How to Forage for Food in the Fall2," Whatever food you find, be sure to prepare them before storage or use. Some handy things to bear in mind include:


If the food is wet, allow it to dry before storing or it will risk rotting.
Wash dirt and debris off food before cooking or eating and remove any parts that are unsuitable for consumption or blemished. Allow for drying of any washed foods before storage.
You may need to remove outer shells, husks or other layers of protection prior to storage or use but what you remove is dependent on the food found.
Some foods will perish quickly, such as berries, so they need to be either eaten fresh or quickly turned into jams, preserves or sauces for longer term storage.;
, Mushrooms are a typical find in the fall season. Chanterelles (also known as ""forest gold"") are found in a number of forest locations but their whereabouts is often a carefully guarded local secret!Other mushrooms usually around in the fall include giant puffballs, ceps, oyster mushrooms, hedgehog fungus, field blewits and horse or Portobello mushrooms (these latter have many poisonous look-alikes, so be careful).Mushrooms can be eaten simply raw in salads, cooked in butter or made into soup, pate, risotto, vegetarian burgers and more.


See How to pick mushrooms for more details on collecting mushrooms and How to cook with mushrooms for more ideas on what to do with them.

, Apples are ready for picking during the fall season and there are plenty of varieties. Finding apple trees for foraging depends on where you live but there are plenty of apple growers who are happy to open their orchards for self-picking for a small fee, so you can still take advantage of gathering your own under those constraints if you can't find wild-growing trees.
Once collected, there is an abundance of things you can do with the apple in your cooking, including making apple pies, apple crumble, applesauce and even making cider from them.


See How to use apples for more ideas.

, These ripen for autumn harvesting and are often found growing in the wild. Crab apples make delicious crab apple jelly or chutney, while persimmons are delicious eaten when ripe. Plums can be eaten as they are or turned into puddings, cakes, jam, chutney and even wine.

Plums: How to cook plums, plum chutney, How to make an eggless plum cake, How to bake a plum cake, plum jam and How to store plums.
Persimmons: How to eat a persimmon.

, There are various berries ready for picking in the fall. Depending on where you live, these include blackberries, wild cherries, lingonberries berries, elderberries, sloe berries, mulberries and sea buckthorn.
Wild cherries are smaller than their domesticated counterparts but avoid the very bitter ones as these can contain trace amounts of cyanide.Berries can be turned into pies and tarts, jams, jellies, sauces, chutneys, smoothies, puddings, desserts and baked into cakes and cookies.
And don't forget to add them homemade ice cream!


See How to forage for blackberries for more information on getting them in the wild. Some recipes include How to make a blackberry pie and How to make a blackberry cobbler.
Sloe berries can be used to make sloe gin.
Be aware that the leaves and stems of elderberries are toxic and some people also suffer adverse reactions to eating the raw berries.Wear gloves when picking and cook the berries if in doubt.

, Many nuts and seeds ripen in the fall and provided you get to them before the squirrels and other local wildlife does, you can stock up your larder with some delicious finds. Just be sure to take only what you need and leave plenty for the animals who rely on these energy-packed sources of food.
You can always rely on ""foraging"" by picking-your-own at a nut grower's farm.



Walnuts and pecans: These nuts can be hard to find in the wild, depending on where you are but they can be found more often in parks and gardens. For more ideas, see:

How to shell pecans, How to toast pecans, How to make pecan crusted blackened catfish and How to make pecan pie.



Hazelnuts: These are usually found August to October, on hazel trees. They can be harvested from the ground but only if the squirrels haven't beaten you to it. They're best enjoyed fresh, added to granola (muesli) or baked into cookies or muffins.
Hazelnuts can also be ground into a flour for use in baking breads, cakes and nut roasts and roasted for eating as they are.
Acorns and sweet chestnuts: Just be sure to collect the right ones as some acorns are dreadfully bitter and only sweet chestnuts are edible, not any other type of chestnut. Acorns are best turned into flour (see How to make acorn flour).
Pine nuts: in some places you may be able to get the edible pine nuts but be aware that birds and wildlife also enjoy these treats and may have removed them before you! A tree net can reserve you a choice tree or two, though! See How to roast pine nuts and How to shell pine nuts for more information.

, Wild herbs and greens are a good source of leaves, seeds and remedies for the expert forager. Many are found all year round, while some are better in autumn or only available then.
Again, it's important to know what you're picking but provided you're certain, there are lots of possible options growing in the wild, including:


Dandelions: these can be collected for their leaves for salads and tea and their roots for roasting and turning into dandelion coffee. The roots are best in autumn while the leaves are best in spring but they are available all year round.See the following for recipes: dandelion wine, dandelion greens, dandelion coffee and dandelion tea.


Dill and fennel: Collect the seeds for use in cooking through the winter and the leaves and bulbs can be eaten too. You can also try making dill bread, dill pickles, roasted fennel and fennel and nashi pear salad.

Burdock, chickweed, purslane are some of the other plants you'll find growing in the wild that can be used in salads, dips, sandwich fillings and cooked dishes.

, Rose petals and rose hips are ready for picking in fall and if you have rose bushes in your own garden, you won't have far to look for them.
For rose hips, they are best collected after the first frost, while rose petals can be collected at any time before they fall.


How to use rose hips in cookery

How to make rose petal jam, rose tea, rose butter.
For rose petals that have already fallen to the ground, gather them for making potpourri, rose scented balls or beads and other rose crafts.

, If you're a hunter, various places have hunting seasons open during fall. This can be a good means to stock your freezer with fresh game meat that will keep you going through the winter.

Prepare boiling and ice-cold water.,
Cut the broccoli heads into small pieces.,
Boil the broccoli pieces for three minutes.,
Chill the broccoli pieces for three minutes.,
Drain and dry.,
Store in sealed bag in the freezer.",How to Keep Broccoli Fresh2," The methods discussed above are great for keeping your broccoli fresh in the short term, but if you have so much broccoli that you don't think you'll be able to eat it all before it goes bad or you simply don't plan on eating it right away, consider freezing it. Frozen broccoli can stay good for over a year, so you'll have plenty of time to incorporate it into your dishes before it goes bad.However, freezing broccoli isn't as simple as tossing it into the freezer and forgetting about it — first, it has to be prepared in a process called blanching. To start, you'll want to prepare a large pot of boiling water along with a similarly large pot or bowl of ice water.

, While you're waiting for your water to boil, take the opportunity to use a knife or a pair of kitchen shears to cut the broccoli heads into small chunks. The head pieces should be no more than an inch or so across on any side, with stems no more than an inch or so long. Dividing the broccoli heads into smaller pieces is important — if you don't do it, the boiling water may blanch the broccoli unevenly by affecting the outer edges of the broccoli more heavily than the protected inner portion.


You can even use your bare hands to break up the broccoli heads if you need to. Simply grab pieces of the head and pull them off of the main plant so that you are left with a cluster of florets (the ""bushy"" part) and a short stem. If the florets are more than about an inch and a half across, split the cluster again.

, When you've separated all of your broccoli bits into separate pieces, dump them into your boiling water to blanch them. They don't need to boil for very long — about three minutes is plenty. Stir periodically to ensure that the broccoli pieces are evenly blanched.


The purpose of blanching is to help preserve the broccoli when it is frozen. All vegetables contain enzymes and bacteria that can cause the color, texture, and taste of the vegetable to become unappetizing during freezing. Blanching kills the bacteria and disables the enzymes, which means that the broccoli will maintain its original delicious properties better after it's frozen.

, As soon as your broccoli pieces have boiled for about three minutes, drain them with a colander or strainer. Then, when the excess hot water has flowed through the colander and poses no danger of burning you, immediately dump them into your ice-cold water. Let them soak in the ice water for about three minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure that all of the pieces come in contact with the cold water.


The purpose of the ice water is to immediately cool the broccoli down so that it doesn't continue cooking. The broccoli is boiled to blanch it, not to cook it — if it's allowed to keep cooking, the broccoli will eventually become soft and unappetizing. Putting hot broccoli pieces directly in the freezer doesn't cool the steaming broccoli down as quickly as the direct contact of ice water, so the latter is a better choice for our purposes.

, After the broccoli has soaked in the ice water for about three minutes (it should feel about as cold as the water when you touch it), pour it into a colander or strainer and allow it to briefly rest. As it rests, toss the broccoli occasionally to allow trapped moisture to drain. After a minute or two, pat it with a clean rag or paper towel to remove any excess moisture.

, Transfer the broccoli pieces into a plastic bag with an airtight seal and label the bag with today's date. Squeeze the excess air out of the bag, seal it, and toss it in the freezer. At this point, you're done! Once it freezes, your broccoli should keep for up to a year.


To get the maximum lifetime out of your frozen broccoli, use a low-temperature ""deep freezer"", not a zero-frost freezer, as the latter periodically cycles above freezing to melt the ice in the compartment, which can reduce the life of the broccoli.Specialty vacuum-sealing devices (like the FoodSaver) are great for freezing vegetables. By removing all of the air from the bag or container that the broccoli is stored in, they can extend its freezer life and keep the broccoli fresher than with ordinary freezing methods. However, these devices can cost upwards of $100.For many recipes (especially baking recipes), you won't want to defrost vegetables before cooking, as this can throw off the moisture content of the final dish. However, for recipes that call for defrosted broccoli, all you need to do to do is soak the broccoli in room temperature water for a few minutes to thaw it.

Look for deep green florets.,
Look for florets about the size of a match head.,
Feel for a firm, tight head.,
For homegrown broccoli, harvest in the morning and immediately cool.",How to Keep Broccoli Fresh3," If you want to have fresh, crisp, delicious broccoli in your fridge, it's helpful if you start with the freshest possible vegetables in the first place. Whether you're picking out your broccoli at the local supermarket or pulling it fresh from your garden, it's a smart idea to know the signs of a fresh, healthy plant so that you can consistently choose the best broccoli. To start, try examining the small, beady buds making up the head of the broccoli — these are called ""florets"". The florets of the best broccoli plants should be a deep, somewhat dark green color.


Look out for yellow florets or patches — this is a sign that your broccoli is past its prime and is about to flower, which will make the plant tough and woody., Another thing to take into account when you're picking out your broccoli is the size of the individual florets — are they tiny and almost indistinguishable from each other, or are they large and full? Ideally, you should see some florets that are just smaller than a match head — this is a sign that the broccoli plant is mature, but not over-ripe.You don't necessarily have to shy away from broccoli with exclusively small florets. These plants won't hurt you or taste bad — for instance, most frozen broccoli that you can buy from your grocery store's frozen foods aisle won't have large florets.

, The texture of a broccoli plant is crucial — nothing's better than a satisfyingly crisp head of broccoli on a hot summer day, but nothing's grosser than broccoli that's become soft or chewy. Don't be afraid to use your hands when you're picking out your broccoli. Give each head a gentle squeeze or twist. Ideally, the best heads of broccoli should be quite hard and firm, but not completely unyielding.

, When you buy broccoli at the store, it's already been picked for you, so the way the broccoli is harvested is out of your control. However, when you grow your own broccoli at home, you have total control over how and when the broccoli is harvested, so make the most of these opportunities. Generally, for the best-tasting, freshest broccoli, you'll want to harvest during the coolest part of the day (usually the morning). Cut the entire broccoli head from the plant at its stem and immediately transfer into the refrigerator to preserve its freshness.


Doing this minimizes the amount of time that your broccoli will have to warm up — the cooler it stays, the better its original taste and texture will be preserved.

Look into fruit flowers.,
Consider herb flowers.,
Try vegetable flowers.,
Choose versatile flowers.,
Choose flowers for beverages.,
Choose flowers for salads.,
Identify the source.,
Avoid flowers sprayed with pesticides.,
See if you can find edible flowers in the grocery store.,
Do not harvest flowers from the street.,
Store the flowers safely.,
Clean flowers before consumption.,
Make sure to harvest the edible portions.,
Watch for allergic reactions.",How to Choose Edible Flowers," Fruit flowers are a popular form of edible flower because of their fruity, sweet flavor. They are often used in pastries, beverages, and as garnishes. You usually eat the petals of a fruit flower instead of the stem or pistil.Apple blossom flowers can add a mild flavor to fruit dishes, and can also be used as a garnish. Just make sure to eat apple blossom flowers in moderation, as too much can be toxic.
Banana blossoms can be cooked or eaten raw after the tough exterior is removed to get to the soft, white flowers. You need to set the flowers in water until the sap drains, however.
Citrus blossoms, when distilled in water, are frequently used in beverages. Elderberry blossoms have a sweet scent and flavor and are often used to make wine.;
, Herb flowers imitate the taste and texture of actual herbs. They can be used to add flavor to a dish, as a garnish, in salads, and in tea.Most herbs you would buy at the grocery store, like chives and cilantro, come in flower form. Usually, you would use the petals from such flowers as a garnish or spice in a dish.
Some herb flowers, such as basil, may have a milder flavor than the herb. These flowers can be great if you want to add just a touch of a particular flavor to a dish.

, Many vegetables are actually flowers. You can harvest the flowers of a plant like broccoli before it's fully grows. Vegetable flowers are great for salads, sandwiches, and stir fries.Broccoli florets are actually a flower. If you harvest broccoli when it's still in the form of yellow flowers, you'll end up with a mild broccoli flavor that can be great for salads. Young leaves from artichokes, corn shoots, and squash provide a similarly mild vegetable flavor.
The seeds of okra can be eaten, and many people find it has an energizing effect. Okra seeds are sometimes used as a substitute for coffee.

, The taste of some flowers works well in a wide range of recipes. If you cook with flowers frequently, go for flowers that have a lot of different uses. This way, you can use your chosen flowers in multiple recipes.


Lavender is ideal for many culinary uses. Tea, cookies, syrup, cake decoration, sorbets, ice cream, jelly, jam, custard, wine, and vinegar, are just a few of lavender’s endless uses. Lavender imparts its own flavor, along with slight tones of citrus.Rose petals are renowned for many culinary uses, such as syrups, decorations on icing, ice cream, dessert garnishes, jellies, jams, flavored butters, and ice cubes. Chive blossoms are great for savory dishes and will impart a light onion flavor. Garlic blossoms will impart a fresh and light garlic flavor to a salad or dish.

, Edible flowers can be used to enhance the flavor of a drink and provide a pop of color. If you're a big drinker of tea or flavored water, go for flowers that flavor beverages.


Hibiscus has cranberry and citrus notes that are great for drinks. Both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages can be made with hibiscus. Hibiscus is slightly acidic, so use sparingly.
Rose petals are famously used to make rose water.

, Making a garden salad or fruit salad using edible flowers is an easy way to incorporate them into a meal. You'll end up really enhancing the flavor of an average salad by sprinkling it with a variety of edible flowers.


The entire nasturtium plant is edible. They are a perennial favorite for summer salads. Easy to grow, they bring an explosion of color to any salad. Nasturtium have a slight peppery taste. The seed pods are even used as a replacement for peppercorns and capers.Carnations will add a sweet, nutmeg-like flavor. Use them in salads and as a garnish.Petunias are mild tasting and good as a salad garnish.
Pansies are delicate little paper-like flowers that are great for adorning salads. Pansies have a slightly sweet flavor. They also work great in fruit salad.
Violets are perfect for salads and are also a beautiful plate garnish.

, The use of chemicals make most flowers provided by a florist inedible. This also applies to flowers bought in a grocery store. You want to know where flowers came from, and who grew them, to make sure they're safe to eat.Unless labeled as edible, never eat flowers from a florist. Flowers from a florist are usually sprayed with chemicals to maintain a certain appearance. If you talk to the florist, and he or she assures you the flowers are safe to eat, they may be edible. However, unless the florists specifically tells you they are edible, do not eat flowers from a florist.
It's unlikely that grocery store flowers are safe for consumption. Like flowers sold by a florist, they are usually sprayed with chemicals. It's doubtful a grocery store worker would have any information for you regarding the chemicals used on these types of flowers.
Growing edible flowers in your garden is another way to ensure they are safe to eat. If you have the space, and enjoy eating flowers, look into creating a flower garden in your backyard.

, All flowers grown with pesticides and chemicals contain toxins and are not edible. If you aren't sure if chemicals were used, avoid them.Look for organic flowers, but be aware that some organic flowers only limit the use of toxins.
Your local farmer's market is the best place to buy edible flowers. The farmers will generally be able to provide you with information about how their flowers were grown and let you know if they're safe to eat. Flowers sold at a farmer's market are generally less likely to have been grown with heavy use of pesticides.

, Certain grocery stores may sell edible flowers. These flowers will be labeled as edible on the container, and may not be sold in the regular flower aisle. You can try asking a worker whether your local grocery store sells edible flowers.You may be less likely to find edible flowers at a conventional grocery store. Try an organic food store, or a food co-op.
Never eat flowers from a grocery store unless they are specifically labeled as edible.

, If you know a type of edible flower you're craving grows on the roadside, it may be tempting to pick it. However, you should never harvest flowers from the roadside. These flowers are not safe for consumption.Roadside flowers are exposed to contamination from passing cards. Flowers on the road may also be occasionally sprayed with chemicals as part of a city beautification program.
Livestock and dogs may also eliminate near the flowers, which can further contaminate them.

, Once you obtain edible flowers, you'll want to store them in a safe place. Proper storage of edible flowers can help them last longer and remain safe for use.A plastic container should be used over a plastic bag when storing flowers, as a container is less likely to crush the flowers.
You should also place a moist piece of paper in a flower container to keep the flowers from wilting.

, This is especially important if you harvested the flowers from your backyard. You'll want to run the flowers underneath water to get rid of bugs and dirt. You can also dust off dirt with a makeup brush or small paint brush. After cleaning the flowers, set them aside to dry on a paper towel., Not every part of a flower is edible. When preparing flowers for consumption, make sure to harvest the edible portions. Usually, you should only be eating the leaves of a flower and not the stem or pistil.Sepal is a portion of the flower just underneath the petal. A flower's sepal looks like a cluster of green leaves. It should be removed before you can safely eat the flower.

, Flowers that are edible may still be hazardous to your health if you have allergies. Pay attention to any allergic reactions that you may have when handling or eating the flowers.If you notice any signs of an allergic reaction, such as a rash or hives, cease eating the flowers and contact your physician.
If you have a pollen allergy, do not eat edible flowers.

Search for grapes with green stems that are firmly connected to the fruit.,
Examine the colors and hues of grapes to determine their ripeness.,
Verify that the grapes smell fresh and sweet.,
Look for signs of mold on clusters of grapes.,
Place your grapes in the refrigerator immediately upon arriving home.,
Place grapes into a sealed plastic bag or airtight container without washing them.,
Store your grapes at the back of the refrigerator.,
Separate stacks of grapes when buying in bulk to promote air circulation.,
Store your grapes away from odorous foods, such as onions and leeks.,
Rinse or wash grapes immediately before eating or cooking.,
Eat grapes within 72 hours of being removed from refrigeration.",How to Keep Grapes Fresh," Grapes with brown stems that disconnect easily are often extremely ripe, and may spoil at a faster rate.;
, All white grapes should have a frosty green hue, whereas red and purple grapes should have rich, dark tones.Avoid purchasing grapes that feature brown discoloration or abnormal hues, which are signs that may indicate rot.

, Grapes that have become spoiled may smell strongly of vinegar as a result of fermentation.

, If grapes are excessively soft to the touch and are displaying white and gray patches of mold, choose a different bunch of grapes. Mold is a sign of rot and could spread quickly to the remaining healthy grapes in your bunch.

, Grapes will stay freshest when stored at temperatures between 30 and 32 degrees Fahrenheit (-1 and 0 degrees Celsius).

, Washing your grapes will accelerate the ripening process, and will cause them to spoil quickly within 7 days.


Wash your grapes only if you have plans to freeze them right away. Before placing in the freezer, make sure to line the grapes on a cookie sheet to prevent them from freezing and sticking together, then place them into a separate storage container after each grape has become individually frozen.

, The space at the back of your refrigerator is often kept cooler, and will help keep your grapes fresh for between 2 and 3 weeks.

, Keeping crates of grapes stacked on top of one another may cause them to spoil sooner.

, Grapes have the ability to absorb odors, and may acquire a strange or stale taste if stored near odorous foods.

, Rinsing grapes can help remove bacteria and other foreign residue from the fruit that could be harmful to your health.

, Grapes that have been removed from refrigeration will start to wrinkle and shrink after a 72-hour time period."

Know what you’re looking for.,
Evaluate the coloring of the pineapple skin.,
Feel the pineapple to see if it is ripe.,
Check the size of the eyes from the top to the bottom.,
Smell and listen to your pineapple.,
Look out for deterioration.,
Store the pineapple on your counter.,
Refrigerate your pineapple whole.,
Refrigerate sliced pineapple.,
Freeze fresh pineapple for long-term storage.,
Use a dehydrator to dry pineapple for storage.,
Can or jar your pineapple.",How to Buy and Store Fresh Pineapple," When choosing a pineapple, there are two qualifications that you should keep in mind: ripeness and deterioration. Ripeness is the measure of whether or not the fruit is ready to eat, while deterioration measures if the fruit has begun to break down.Ripeness is indicated by the yellow gold color present on the skin of the pineapple.
Deterioration is indicated by a wrinkling of the skin.;
, The skin should be vibrant greens and yellows with no white or browned areas. Depending on the variety of the pineapple, the coloring should be more yellow than green.The yellow-gold color should be present at least around the eyes of the fruit as well as around the base.
While a pineapple can feasibly be ripe while fully green, there is very little way to know for sure that it is, so purchasing a fully green pineapple is risky.
The higher up the pineapple the yellow-gold reaches, the more evenly flavored the pineapple.

, If the coloring of the pineapple fits the ideal description, that doesn’t guarantee that it’s ripe. In order to be certain, you should feel the consistency and yield of the skin.Gently squeeze the fruit. It should be firm but the skin should give slightly.
There should be no indented or squishy spots. A good pineapple that is ripe and juicy will feel heavy.

, They should all be similar in size and color and be free from mold. The eyes can be some of the stronger indicators as to whether or not the pineapple is ripe and sweet.Choose the pineapple with the largest eyes. The size of the eyes indicates how long the pineapple was left to ripen on the branch.
Look for a pineapple with flat eyes. Flat eyes can indicate the sweetness of the fruit.

, While the odor and sound of a pineapple are not necessarily strong indicators of its ripeness alone, in the presence of other indicators they can help you choose the best one.


The smell of the pineapple should be sweet, but if it is too sweet and almost has a hint of alcohol, then it is beyond it’s freshness.
A ripe fruit will have a dull, solid sound. Unripe fruits will sound hollow.

, Although you are looking for a fruit that has had enough time to fully ripen, you also need to look out for one that has spent too much time since being pulled from the branch. Once a pineapple begins to show signs of deterioration, it is considered over-ripe and is no longer a good choice.A deteriorating pineapple will exhibit wrinkled skin and feel soft to the touch.
Look for leaks or cracks in the fruit, both are strong signs of deterioration.
The leaves of a deteriorating pineapple will appear brown and stiff.

, Pineapples do not need to be refrigerated for the first few days you have them at home. In fact, if you intend to eat your pineapple within a day or two of purchasing it, feel free to just store it on your counter.


Keep an eye on your pineapple to make sure it doesn’t begin to exhibit signs of deterioration as it sits.
It is recommended that you purchase your pineapple on the same day you intend to eat it so as to avoid deterioration.

, If you would like to prolong the life of your pineapple for a few more days, you can keep it in your refrigerator. Remember, pineapples do not have a significant shelf life even when refrigerated so it is recommended that you eat your pineapple within 3-5 days even when using this method.Wrap the pineapple in plastic before placing it in the refrigerator.
Check the pineapple each day for signs of deterioration.

, You can prolong the life of your pineapple by another day or two beyond simply refrigerating it by slicing it first. It can be more difficult to know if your pineapple has begun to deteriorate once it is sliced, so it is recommended that you eat the pineapple within 6 days of purchase even using this method.Use a serrated knife to cut off the top of the pineapple off, then slice off each of the sides.
Once you have the outer portion of the pineapple removed, slice it to a width of your liking, then use a cookie cutter or knife to remove the core from the center of the slices.
Store your pineapple slices in an airtight container like Tupperware to maximize its lifespan.

, You can prolong the life of your pineapple for as much as 12 months by freezing it. You will need to remove the skin and the core of the pineapple first.Once the skin and core are removed from the pineapple, store it in an airtight container like Tupperware.
Leave a small amount of air in the container with the pineapple.

, If you happen to have a dehydrator, you can prepare and store your pineapple nearly indefinitely! Dehydrating removes the moisture from the pineapple and makes it a bit more like pineapple “chips” but with all the same nutritional value. Use a sharp knife to peel, core and slice your pineapple. Make sure your slices are consistently about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick.
Place in your dehydrator according to the manufacturer's recommendation or at 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54 degrees Celsius) until the fruit reaches a leathery state but is not sticky.
It may take 12-18 hours to be fully dehydrated.

, The last possible method to storing your pineapple for an extended period of time is canning. Canning or jarring your pineapple can prolong its life for a year or more, but it is not recommended to store it for longer than a year to be safe.Once again, slice and core your pineapple by cutting off the top and skins. This time, cutting the pineapple into chunks instead of slices may make it easier to can.
You will need to boil your pineapple in a “packing” solution to occupy the additional space in the can and keep it moisturized. You can use apple juice, white grape juice or light to medium “canning syrup” you can buy at some specialty grocery stores.After boiling the pineapple in the packing solution, fill your jars, leaving an inch or so of open space at the top.
Place the lids on the jars finger tight, then place it (or however many you have) in a pot with water approximately 1-2 inches taller than the top of the jar or can.
Boil the jars for 25 minutes for a pint jar, 30 minutes for quarts. After removing them, the air will have been evacuated and the pineapple will be good to store.

Preheat your oven to the lowest temperature setting.,
Peel and slice the bananas.,
Dip the pieces in lemon juice.,
Place the bananas on a wire rack.,
Add additional flavor if desired.,
Place the bananas in the preheated oven.,
Let them bake according to shape and desired crispiness.,
Cool the bananas completely on a wire rack.,
Store the bananas in an airtight container.",How to Dehydrate Bananas1," This is usually between 125º—200ºF (50º—90ºC).


A higher temperature risks scorching the outside and not drying the inside.;
, To make chips, slice the bananas into 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) rounds. To make wedges, cut the banana lengthwise, then lengthwise again, and slice into desired length.NOTE: Wedges can take up to 12 hours to dry! Start preparing them in the morning so you don't risk starting a fire overnight. Chips dry much more quickly.
For extra crispy chips, slice the bananas into 1/8 inch rounds instead (0.3 cm). This may be easier with a mandoline.
If the bananas are mushy and difficult to slice, chill them in the fridge for 5-10 minutes to firm them up.You don't even need a knife to make wedges! Work your finger into the end of the peeled banana and it should divide into three segments.It doesn't matter if the banana breaks in the process. You'll want it in smaller lengths anyway.
For a large quantity of bananas, soaking them in lemon juice for several minutes before slicing will save you preparation time, but the additional moisture will add time to the baking stage., This will add flavor and vitamins, but the main purpose is to prevent the bananas from turning brown.


If you don't mind brown chips, you can skip this step.
Brushing the juice onto both sides of the bananas will also work.
Pineapple juice, lime juice, or any other acidic juice will work instead. You can even use vitamin C tablets crushed in water.
If you don't like the flavor of the juice, dilute it in a 1:4 ratio with water and soak the bananas for 3-5 minutes.

, This raised wire platform exposes every side of the banana to the air and allows excess moisture to drip through. Also ready a cookie sheet or baking pan to place beneath it.


The bananas should be in a single layer, not stacked atop each other. It's fine if their edges are touching.
If you don't have a wire rack, cover a cookie sheet with parchment paper or spray it with a nonstick cooking spray. This method will be less effective at removing moisture, and could take many hours longer (especially for wedges). You can mitigate this by leaving the oven door a few inches ajar to allow moisture to escape.An electric fan kept next to the open oven door will also help air circulate., A sprinkling of sea salt or kosher salt adds a great savory flavor, perfect for eating on their own.

, Use the center rack of the oven and be careful not to drop any slices onto the oven floor.


If using a wire rack, place the baking sheet in the oven first to catch drips, then place the rack on top of the baking sheet.

, For chips, this will take 1 to 3 hours. Wedges will take 6 to 12 hours. The longer you bake them, the crispier they will be.


Flip the bananas over once about halfway through the baking process. This will dry each side evenly and is especially important if the bananas are placed directly on a baking sheet.
The bananas will become crispier as they cool, so remove them when they're still a little softer than you would like.

, They won't be completely dry or crunchy until they're cooled to room temperature.


If you don't have a wire rack, a dish-drying rack can work instead. An ordinary plate will still do in a pinch.

, If completely dried, they should stay good for months.

Create a syrup for the apricots.,
Remove the skins.,
Slice the apricots and immediately dunk them in the syrup.,
Pack the jars with the apricots.,
Process the cans.",How to Can Apricots1," Use honey or sugar to create a light to medium syrup to preserve the apricots inside the can.For every 1 qt (1 L) of water, add 2 cups (500 ml) sugar for a light syrup or 3 cups (750 ml) for a medium syrup.
If using honey, for every 1 qt (1 L) of water, add 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) honey for a light syrup or 2 cups (500 ml) for a medium syrup.
Boil the sweetener and water together in a saucepan until the sugar or honey dissolves. Then reduce the syrup to a low heat, keeping it at a simmer.
Alternatively, you could also use apple juice or white grape juice instead of a syrup.;
, Quickly remove the skins by blanching the fruit in boiling water.


Boil water in a medium saucepan.
Dunk the apricots in the boiling water for 2 minutes.
Immediately transfer the apricots to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking.
Slip the skins off with your fingers.

, Use a kitchen knife to cut each apricot in half. Remove the pits, and if desired, cut the apricots into serving-size slices. Place them directly in the still-simmering syrup to prevent them from discoloring or darkening.


Once the apricots are inside the syrup, let them continue simmering until heated through. Give it 2 to 4 minutes to do so.
You will need 16 lb (7.2 kg) of fruit to create 7 qt (7 L) of canned fruit. For 9 pints (4.25 L), you will need about 10 lb (4.5 kg).

, Ladle the apricots and syrup into each jar, leaving about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace at that top of each jar. Screw on the lids, making sure that they are as tight as possible.


Place the fruit inside the jars cut-side-down, if possible, so more fruit will fit inside each jar.
As the apricots undergo the canning process, the contents of the jar will expand. If you do not leave enough headspace at the top of the jar, the lid may not seal properly or the glass may even break.
Make sure the jars are clean and sanitized before use. The lids should also be clean and sterilized.

, Use canning tongs to lower each jar into your canner carefully. Make sure the jars do not clink together as you arrange them, since doing so can cause the glass to break. You can use a boiling-water canner, dial-gauge pressure canner, or weighted-gauge pressure canner, but the amount of processing time will vary depending on which method you use.For boiling-water canners:

Pints should be processed for 20 minutes at altitudes between 0 and 1000 feet (0 to 305 m), 25 minutes between 1001 and 3000 feet (305 to 915 m), 30 minutes at altitudes between 3001 and 6000 feet (915 to 1830 m), and 35 minutes above 6000 feet (1830 m).
Quarts should be processed for 25 minutes at altitudes between 0 and 1000 feet (0 to 305 m), 30 minutes between 1001 and 3000 feet (305 to 915 m), 35 minutes at altitudes between 3001 and 6000 feet (915 to 1830 m), and 40 minutes above 6000 feet (1830 m).


When using a dial-gauged pressure canner, process both pints and quarts for 10 minutes. Use a pressure of 6 PSI for altitudes between 0 and 2000 feet (0 and 610 m), 7 PSI between 2001 and 4000 feet (610 and 1220 m), 8 PSI between 4001 and 6000 feet (1220 and 1830 m), and 9 PSI between 6001 and 8000 feet (1830 and 2440 m).
When using a weighted-gauge pressure canner, process both pints and quarts for 10 minutes. Use a pressure of 5 PSI between 0 and 1000 feet (0 and 305 m) and 10 PSI for anything above 1001 feet (305 m).</ref>

Use lemon juice.,
Use salt.,
Use carbonated drinks.,
Use Fruit-Fresh.,
Blanch the apples.,
Cover in plastic wrap.,
Use the rubber band method.",How to Keep a Cut Apple from Turning Brown1," Apples turn brown due to an enzyme in the fruit that reacts with oxygen in the air. This process is known as ""oxidation."" Lemon juice works to prevent oxidation as it contains citric acid, which is an effective anti-oxidant. You can use either freshly squeezed or reconstituted lemon juice, though it may be best to only use this method on sweeter types of apple, as the lemon juice will add tartness. To use lemon juice to stop your cut apples from turning brown, you can use one of two methods:









You can also use lemon to prevent browning by soaking the apple pieces in a bowl of cold water and lemon juice. You should use a ratio of one tablespoon of lemon juice to one cup of water. You only need to soak the apple for 3-5 minutes, before draining and rinsing.Lime juice can be used in place of the lemon juice in these methods, as limes also contain the citric acid necessary to prevent oxidation. Pineapple juice is another good option.;
, Salt is a natural preservative and can be effective in keeping cut apples from turning brown. Sprinkle Kosher salt over a plate of cut apple slices using a kitchen tablespoon. To ensure your apple slices do not taste salty, do not use much more than a tablespoon's worth of salt. The apple slices should remain unoxidized for some time.








Don't worry about your fruit tasting salty - as long as you don't use too much salt your fruit will taste just fine.

, Carbonated drinks which contain citric acid can also be useful for preventing your apples from turning brown. Lemon-lime soda and ginger ale are two popular options which can be used to soak your cut apples.









Simply pop the apples in a bowl of your chosen carbonated drink for 3-5 minutes, then drain. You can rinse the apple pieces, if you like, or leave them if you enjoy the added flavor!
Seltzer water is another option that supposedly works to prevent apples from browning, so you can also give that a try if you have some lying around!, Fruit-Fresh is a powdered form of citric and ascorbic acids which is specifically designed to prevent fruit from turning brown. It claims to prevent food from browning for up to eight hours, and can be found in the canned goods section of most grocery stores.








To use Fruit-Fresh, all you need to do is sprinkle half a teaspoon of the powder per cup of chopped apple and toss to coat., It is possible to blanch cut apples to prevent them from browning. Blanching basically deactivates the enzymes in the apple, preventing them from reacting with oxygen in the air.To blanch your cut apples, simply place them in a pot of boiling water for approximately five minutes, then remove and rinse with cold water.









Be aware that using this method will significantly soften the texture of the apple, making it less suitable for eating on it's own. As a result, this method is best reserved for apples that you plan on using in cooking or baking., A very simple method you can use to prevent apples from browning is just to cover the cut apple with plastic wrap. This technique works by keeping the air away from the apple flesh, thus preventing the apple flesh from oxidizing. Try to wrap the plastic around the apple as tightly as possible and avoid having any creases in the plastic wrap on the exposed side of the apple.









This method works best with half of a whole apple, rather than several pieces, as it is easier to wrap the plastic tightly around a single piece.
Be aware that if any air at all remains inside the plastic wrap, the apple will begin to oxidize. As it is very difficult to eliminate all air, this method may not be the most effective.

, The rubber band method is an innovative, yet easy way to prevent your apple from browning, though it can only be used with an entire apple that has been cut into slices, with the skin left on. This method works as it leaves none of the apple's flesh exposed to the air.








Simply cut the apple up into regular sized slices, then piece it back together like a jigsaw until it resumes its original form. Wrap a rubber band around the apple, so it looks like it has never been cut.This is a good option for people who like to bring cut apples to work, or send them in their kids' school lunches.

Shop locally.,
Make a list.,
Avoid, or at least be cautious about, the '3 for 2' trick.,
Avoid ready meals.,
Batch cook.",How to Eat Well for Less," You may think that going to supermarkets and chain stores is the cheapest way to shop, but try visiting your local market stall, as lower overheads should mean lower prices. Using local stores and markets will also support your local community.;
, If you do shop at a supermarket, make a list and stick to it. Plan a few meals and only buy what you need. It's easy to buy extra items as the layout is designed to encourage you to spend as much as possible. Always go for ""own/home brand"" goods for the best value.

, If a store is encouraging you to buy 3 items for the price of 2, this is merely to get you to buy an extra item you wouldn't otherwise buy. Stop and think whether you actually need 2 of the same item, let alone 3. If you do, great - go for it, but if not, just buy what you need. Buy-one-get-one-free deals are a better value but only if you need at least one of the item anyway.

, Don't buy convenience food. It's not only high in salt, sugar and fat, but it's also expensive. You can make tastier, more nutritious versions of the same meals for a fraction of the price by buying the ingredients from your local market and even borrowing cookery books from your local library. Make your own sandwiches rather than buying them pre-packed. If you spend just 2 pounds or $4 a day on sandwiches at work, it will cost you 500 pounds or $1000 a year. And foregoing a daily frothy coffee will save you nearly £2,000 or $4000 over five years.

, To save money on ingredients as well as the energy needed to cook your food, don't cook individual portions. Cook large amounts and freeze the extra. To save energy and therefore money, put lids on saucepans when cooking and re-heat food with a microwave rather than a hob or stove top.

Follow the directions in the first method to clean and crisp your lettuce.








,
Divide the leaves into smaller sections and place them in a large bowl.,
Place a folded paper towel on top of your tossed salad.,
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.,
Remove the bowl from the fridge.,
Replace the paper towel every few days and store the remaining salad for up to 1 week.







",How to Keep Lettuce Crisp2,", Toss different types of lettuce, such as green, red and cabbage for an even healthier side salad.








, The paper towel will absorb excess moisture, keeping the salad from wilting.








, Put it in the fridge until you are ready to use it.








, Pour some salad into another bowl. Toss it separately.









Make sure you don’t season it while it’s in the storage bowl. Salt will make the salad wilt faster, because it will draw moisture out of the lettuce leaves.

Determine what kind of diet is healthy for you.,
Rethink the ratios in your diet.,
Create a budget.",How to Eat Healthy on a Budget1," ""Healthy"" means different things for different people, but the aim should be to get the vitamins and nutrients you need to give you energy, prevent illness, and help you live the type of life you imagine for yourself. Make a list of the foods that fit your personal definition of healthy, keeping the following factors in mind:


Consider your physical needs. Are there certain foods that make you feel energetic, while others make you sluggish? Get in tune with what foods are good for you.
Do you have food allergies or a condition that is exacerbated by eating certain foods? Take this into account when you're making your list.
What do you love to eat? A healthy diet should be one you enjoy. Add your favorite foods to your personal list. Similarly, feel free to leave out foods you don't want to eat. Healthy eating shouldn't feel like a burden.;
, The most expensive foods are often the ones that we probably don't need to eat at every meal, or even every day.


Fruits, vegetables, legumes and grains are highly nutritious and can be bought for low prices, and should make up the bulk of your meals.
Meat, eggs, fish and dairy products are most nutritious when they are free-range, organic, or grass-fed, which can really add up in the grocery store. If you treat these items as side dishes or eat them every other day instead of making them the focus of every meal, you'll get more nutritional punch for your money.
Cheese, bread, desserts and other processed foods tend to be expensive, and they're also the most expendable items in terms of nutrition. When you're trying to eat healthy on a budget, it's best to limit these items as much as possible.

, Now that you've listed the foods that make up your personal diet and prioritized them according to nutritional value and expense, it's time to create a detailed budget to help you plan your food shopping.


How much money can you spend on food each month?

If you go out to eat, remember to count your restaurant trips as part of your monthly food budget. Factor in morning coffee purchases, afternoon snacks, and any other food purchases that you make over the course of a month. These will detract from the amount you have to spend on your food shopping trips.


Working backwards from your monthly food budget amount, determine how much you can spend on each shopping trip.
Divide your shopping trip budget into different food categories, and decide how much money you want to allot to the various items.
Once you have a complete budget for your shopping trip, it's time to source your food.

Prepare the bananas.,
Add additional flavor if desired.,
Spray or rub a little oil on the rack of your dehydrator.,
Place the slices on the dehydrator's drying rack.,
Set the temperature to 135º F (57ºC).,
Cool the bananas to room temperature before eating.",How to Dehydrate Bananas2," The early preparation is similar to the oven method, but pay attention to the sizes.


Peel the bananas and slice them in 1/4 inch rounds (0.6 cm) to produce leathery chews, or slice them 1/16 to 1/8 inches thick (0.15 to 0.3 cm) to make crunchy chips.
Chips will take up to 24 hours to dehydrate, whereas leather should be done within 12. Plan accordingly.
Slices smaller than 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) will tend to stick together when stored.Dip the pieces in lemon juice to prevent the chips from turning brown. This step is optional.

, Grated nutmeg works well with the bananas' natural sweetness., This step isn't mandatory, but will prevent the banana slices from sticking. You could even rub oil directly onto the bananas to be extra cautious., None of the slices should overlap. It's fine if they touch slightly; they should shrink a little as they dry.

, Making leathery chews will take anywhere from 6 to 12 hours. Crisp chips will take longer, up to a full 24 hour day.


If your model of dehydrator comes with specific instructions for bananas, use the temperature and time listed there instead.
Check their progress every 2-4 hours and rotate the tray to ensure even drying.
If you decided not to put lemon juice on them, the caramel brown color is a good sign that they're done or nearly done. Otherwise, you can take a sample out to taste test once it's cooled to room temperature.
If you leave your chews in too long and dislike the extra-tough texture, continue to dehydrate them and turn them into crisps. This may not work if the slices are extra thick.

, If you store them in an airtight container, they should stay good for months.

Peel the bananas.,
Place the whole bananas between two sheets of parchment paper.,
Use a heavy cutting board to smash the bananas.,
Transfer the parchment paper to the dehydrator rack.,
Set your dehydrator to 135ºF (57ºC) for 7 hours.,
Let cool and slice into strips.",How to Dehydrate Bananas3," You can keep them whole or slice them in half lengthwise.

, The bananas should be at least 3 inches apart from one another.

, Try to apply even pressure to keep the banana mash an even consistency.


You can also use a rolling pin for this.
The goal is to get the bananas down to about 1/8 of an inch (0.3 cm). If you don't want to measure them, just make it as flat as you can!

, Peel off the top sheet before you begin dehydrating., Check in at the 4 and 6 hour mark to see how they're doing.


When ready, the top should be leathery but not sticky.
If the bottom is still moist, you can optionally flip them over halfway through.

, These can be rolled up and stored in an airtight container for several months.

Peel and slice the bananas.,
Oil a microwave safe plate.Use a generous amount of pleasantly flavored oil such as olive or coconut oil.,
Microwave on high for one minute.,
Turn each slice over.,
Continue microwaving for 30 seconds at a time.,
Serve immediately.",How to Dehydrate Bananas4," Aim for 1/4 inch rounds (0.6 cm) or slightly smaller. Larger slices won't cook as well, while smaller ones burn more easily.

, Place the banana slices on the plate with space between each one.

, The bananas should start turning soft and releasing moisture.

, You can also add additional flavor at this point. A sprinkling of sea salt or kosher salt adds a great savory flavor, while grated nutmeg or ground cinnamon works well with the bananas' sweetness., This might take a couple minutes depending on your microwave.

, Unlike other drying methods, these will only stay fresh for about a day.

Check your area's weather forecast.,
Make or purchase an outdoor drying screen.,
Prepare the bananas.,
Add additional flavor if desired.,
Place the chips on the mesh of the drying frame.,
Cover the chips with an insect-proof netting or cheesecloth.,
Place the drying frame in direct sunlight away from sources of car exhaust and out of reach of animals.,
Bring the drying frame indoors at night.,
Flip the bananas over once about halfway through the drying process.,
Continue to dry for up to 7 days.,
Store the bananas in an airtight container.,
Finished.

",How to Dehydrate Bananas5," To successfully sun dry fruit, you'll need at least 2 days of hot, dry weather and a clear sky (at least 90º F/32ºC with low humidity). Ideally you should allow for a full 7 days of drying, especially if the temperature is below 100ºF/38ºC.

, All you need is a rectangular wooden frame with a food-safe mesh stretched across it.


Stainless steel or plastic are the best options for meshes. Do NOT use aluminum, hardware cloth, or fiberglass meshes (unless the fiberglass mesh is clearly labeled food-grade).

, Since you're using a much lower temperature than other methods, you may wish to slice them extra thin.


Peel the bananas and slice them into 1/8 inch rounds (0.3 cm), or at least no larger than 1/4 inch (0.6 cm).
If you want to prevent browning, dip the pieces in lemon juice.

, Powdered cinnamon adds a strong flavor for sweet snacking.

, Keep them in a single layer with no overlaps. It's fine if their edges touch; they should shrink a little as they dry.

, This will help keep dust off your food as well.

, Elevate it at least a few inches off the ground (for instance by placing it atop stacked cinder blocks).


Your roof is a great high-sun option that keeps it removed from most environmental pollution.
A concrete driveway will reflect the heat from the ground, drying the bananas faster.

, Even if the nights are still relatively warm, dew will add additional moisture to the bananas. Put it outside again during the day.

, The timing doesn't need to be precise; anytime on the second day of drying is fine.

, Check daily to see if they're ready to eat.


If you're not sure, just cut one open or bite into it to check for moisture.

, If completely dried, they should stay good for months.

Create a syrup for the apricots.,
Cut the apricots in half.,
Pack the jars with the apricots.,
Ladle the syrup into the jars.,
Process the cans.",How to Can Apricots2," Use honey or sugar to create a light to medium syrup to preserve the apricots inside the can. The syrup you need to prepare for a raw pack is the same as the syrup you need to prepare for a hot pack.


For every 1 qt (1 L) of water, add 2 cups (500 ml) sugar for a light syrup or 3 cups (750 ml) for a medium syrup.
If using honey, for every 1 qt (1 L) of water, add 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) honey for a light syrup or 2 cups (500 ml) for a medium syrup.
Boil the sweetener and water together in a saucepan until the sugar or honey dissolves. After it thickens into syrup, remove it from the heat.
Alternatively, you could also use apple juice or white grape juice instead of a syrup.

, Use a kitchen knife to cut each apricot in half. Remove the pits, and if desired, cut the apricots into serving-size slices.


You may want to consider quickly dipping each half or slice in diluted lemon juice to prevent the fruit from discoloring or darkening.
You will need 16 lb (7.2 kg) of fruit to create 7 qt (7 L) of canned fruit. For 9 pints (4.25 L), you will need about 10 lb (4.5 kg).
Note that, for the raw pack method, you will not need to remove the skins. Just make sure that each piece of fruit has been washed well under running water first.

, Fill the jars with the apricot halves or slices, leaving about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty headspace at the top of each jar.


Place the fruit inside the jars cut-side-down. Doing so makes it easier to fit more fruit into each jar.
Make sure the jars are clean and sanitized before use. The lids should also be clean and sterilized.

, Pour the warm syrup over the apricot slices in the jars. Gently shake the jar from side to side to ensure that syrup makes it all the way down to the bottom, and maintain the 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of headspace at the top of the jar while filling them with syrup.


As the apricots undergo the canning process, the contents of the jar will expand. If you do not leave enough headspace at the top of the jar, the lid may not seal properly or the glass may even break.
Screw on the lids once the syrup is in place. Make sure they are on as tight as possible so the cans seal correctly during the canning process.

, Use canning tongs to carefully lower each jar into your canner. Make sure the jars do not clink together as you arrange them, since doing so can cause the glass to break. You can use a boiling-water canner, dial-gauge pressure canner, or weighted-gauge pressure canner, but the amount of processing time will vary depending on which method you use.


Note the processing times for raw-packed canned apricots will vary from those for hot-packed apricots when using boiling-water canners, but they will not vary if using pressure canners.
For boiling-water canners:

Pints should be processed for 25 minutes at altitudes between 0 and 1000 feet (0 to 305 m), 30 minutes between 1001 and 3000 feet (305 to 915 m), 35 minutes at altitudes between 3001 and 6000 feet (915 to 1830 m), and 40 minutes above 6000 feet (1830 m).
Quarts should be processed for 30 minutes at altitudes between 0 and 1000 feet (0 to 305 m), 35 minutes between 1001 and 3000 feet (305 to 915 m), 40 minutes at altitudes between 3001 and 6000 feet (915 to 1830 m), and 45 minutes above 6000 feet (1830 m).


When using a dial-gauged pressure canner, process both pints and quarts for 10 minutes. Use a pressure of 6 PSI for altitudes between 0 and 2000 feet (0 and 610 m), 7 PSI between 2001 and 4000 feet (610 and 1220 m), 8 PSI between 4001 and 6000 feet (1220 and 1830 m), and 9 PSI between 6001 and 8000 feet (1830 and 2440 m).
When using a weighted-gauge pressure canner, process both pints and quarts for 10 minutes. Use a pressure of 5 PSI between 0 and 1000 feet (0 and 305 m) and 10 PSI for anything above 1001 feet (305 m).

Choose your apples wisely.,
Store the cut apples correctly.,
Use a clean, good-quality knife.,
Disguise the browning.,
Use the same methods for other types of fruit.",How to Keep a Cut Apple from Turning Brown2," Certain types of apples are more prone to browning than others, so if you're planning on cutting up your apples, go for kind less inclined to brown. Studies conducted on the browning of apples revealed that: ""Arangeh tend to brown the least. Granny Smith and Golden Smoty apples also showed minimal browning. Golden Delicious apples were in the middle, and Red Delicious apples browned the most.""








, The best way to store cut apples (after using one of the preservation methods listed above) is to place the apple slices in a ziploc bag, seal the bag three-quarters of the way, and draw the air from the bag with your mouth before sealing. Place the bag in the refrigerator until you are ready to eat or serve the slices. They will stay remarkably fresh and crisp.







, If the knife you're using is old, it may be corroded by organic acids and leave deposits of iron salts on the cut fruit. These iron salts can significantly speed up the oxidation process, causing your apple to brown much faster. This is why using a clean, high-quality knife is important in helping to slow down the oxidation process.








, If it's already to late for your fruit this time round, you can attempt to disguise the browning somewhat by sprinkling a little cinnamon on the cut sides of your apple. The flavor of the cinnamon will complement the taste of the apple nicely, while its reddish-brown color may help to disguise the browning. Cinnamon is also a mild antioxidant itself, so a light sprinkling will help to prevent any further browning.







, These methods are not reserved for apples alone, they can be used with any type of fruit that is prone to browning, including bananas, pears, peaches and avocados.

Source your food.,
Go grocery shopping.,
Be open to trying new things.",How to Eat Healthy on a Budget2," Start by doing some research. Find out how to get the best deal on each item, and keep track of the information in a spreadsheet or notebook.


Consider shopping at more than one place. Rather than picking everything up at the same grocery store, try to coupons or hit sales at more than one place.
Eat seasonally. When it's harvest time for a certain food, the prices drop significantly. Pay attention to when the foods on your list are in season. You'll not only save money, but you'll be eating food that's very fresh.
Farmer's markets are full of fresh, often organic produce at very low prices. Find local farmers' markets and strike bargains with the farmers. Many times, they'll be thrilled to sell at a discount if you buy regularly and in bulk.

, It's time to put your budget into practice. As you check items off your grocery list, keep these money-saving tips in mind:


Buy the least expensive variation of any type of food. Some foods come in pre-seasoned frozen packages, in cans, and dried in bags. Figure out which forms of the foods on your list are the cheapest, and buy those.
Give yourself plenty of time to shop. If you go when you're in a hurry, you're more likely grab the most convenient items instead of taking the time to figure out which items are the best bargain.

, You may get to the market and find that strawberries have jumped in price, but blueberries are on sale. Remember that your list is just a basic guide, and you don't have to come home with the exact items you had in mind.

Process food yourself.,
Invest in food storage facilities.,
Eat out only rarely.,
Learn to cook from scratch.,
Use greater quantities of cheap food than expensive food in cooking.",How to Eat Healthy on a Budget3," Processed foods are often more expensive than whole, fresh items. If possible, buy the fresh version and process it yourself. For example:


If you like roasted nuts, buy raw nuts from the bulk food section. Spread them on a baking sheet and roast them until they're toasty and brown. They'll taste even better than pre-roasted nuts.
Instead of buying pre-packaged granola or cereal bars, buy the raw ingredients and make them at home.
Buy whole fresh produce and do your own chopping, dicing, juicing, and freezing.
Make your own sauces, dressings and condiments instead of buying pre-bottled varieties.

, If you have the right storage containers and pantry space, you'll be able to purchase both fresh and dried foods in bulk and keep them for a long time.


Set up a cool, dark cellar or pantry for storing potatoes, applies, squash, onions and other produce.
Set up a large freezer to preserve meat and vegetables.
Purchase bins that you can use to store dried beans, nuts, and grains.

, There's no way around it: eating in restaurants is much more expensive than eating at home, and you have less control over how healthy your food is. Save eating out for special occasions.


When you do go out to eat, choose the simplest item on the menu, which is often the cheapest, too.
Consider eating only part of what you are served, since most restaurant portions are larger than necessary. Take the rest home to eat later, and combine it with a health homemade side dish.

, Cooking from scratch is the cheapest way to eat, and it's often the healthiest.


Instead of buying canned soup, learn out to make a big batch yourself. You can stretch it over the course of several days.
Get in the habit of using leftovers. Manage your refrigerator by resolving never to let anything go bad. Eat it or use it as an ingredient in a sauce, casserole, or soup. For example, old lettuce can be chopped and put into a soup, old salsa can be added to a curry, and old milk can be turned into a quiche. (Of course, don't use anything that has actually gone sour or rancid!)

, Use a base of enriched or whole-grain rice, whole-wheat pasta or bread, or cooked oats to provide cheap, healthy bulk to more expensive, flavorful foods.


Try using less beef in some chili recipes by halving the amount of ground beef called for and adding water and instant plain oats instead. Be original and try your own variations.
In general, cut down on the amount of meat you consume. Meat is one of the most expensive food items you can buy, so by going meatless once or twice a week, you can save a lot of money.

Sit-down brunches are great for small parties, while buffet-style brunches are preferable for large parties.There are no set rules regarding the number of guests required for each type of service; it depends on both the type of food being served as well as the amenities for service. Once your guest list is set, you can decide your service style which will set the tone for the food being served.


For example, fresh pancakes may be feasible for 6 guests but for 20 it can prove to be difficult.
Sit-down services typically have a set menu from which guests can choose from various offerings.
Buffet-style brunch tends to offer wider a selection of options including omelet or pancake stations.;
, Determine if you have guests who require unique menu items. For example, ask your guests if they are vegetarian, vegan, or have food allergies. This will allow you to have a few items available for those who don’t eat traditional brunch menu items such as meat products, eggs, or items cooked with allergy causing ingredients such as peanuts.

, Brunches don’t usually require a theme, but if you are planning a themed brunch it can affect your choice of menu items. For example, if you’re hosting a tea themed brunch you’re more likely to serve tea instead of mimosas. On the other hand, if your theme is a vintage-style brunch you’ll be more likely to serve traditional dishes like eggs benedict or bagels and lox.


Examples of themed brunches include vintage-style, tea party, garden party, formal affair, or springtime soiree., Catering a brunch tends to limit your menu options while choosing to cook your own food allows you absolute freedom. The choice to cater or cook depends on your cooking ability, the number of guests, your budget, and your available time.


Catering costs vary greatly. Some companies offer fixed pricing where the menu item has a set price, tiered pricing where prices are lowered for bulk orders, or custom pricing which is based on each event.If you are planning to cook food items yourself, you can always start the night before. Set out napkins and utensils, make the mix for drinks, and cook items that will hold well over night such as French toast., Brunch is an opportunity to create a spread of meal options for guests to pick and choose from as they please. A brunch menu should provide a well-balanced array of foods from all of the 5 food groups: dairy, fruit, grain, meats and poultry, and vegetables and beans., Bacon, sausage and ham are traditional meat choices for breakfast. When serving bacon, choose to cook it in the oven instead of the stovetop. Not only can you cook larger portions, but you can turn off the oven and keep the bacon warm during brunch., Because eggs are usually the central focus of breakfast and brunch, choose to offer more than one type of egg dish. Quiches and frittatas can be prepared the night before and mixed with various veggies, or egg scrambles can be prepared quickly and mixed with items such as meat and potatoes.


Omelette bars are often staples of brunches because your guests can customize their egg dish. They are typical of buffet style services but require time and patience.Eggs benedict is also a traditional brunch choice. It includes an English muffin topped with Canadian bacon, a poached egg, and topped with hollandaise sauce., Potatoes are common brunch additions, as they can be made into hash browns or potato pancakes. Hash browns and roasted potatoes are not only easy to cook, but they can also be spruced up by adding extras such as spinach, onions and peppers, or cheese. They may also be added to omelets, quiches and breakfast casseroles., Grain products are extremely versatile and help to keep guests full. In addition, they can be both savory and sweet. Try bagels with smear, a baguette with jam or butter, scones, muffins, pancakes, or French toast.


French toast and scones can be prepared and frozen two weeks ahead of time. Simply place them in the oven the morning of the event.Bagels are versatile because they can be served as lox with cream cheese and cured salmon. Lox are a staple at traditional New York style brunches., While dairy products don’t constitute a major portion of a brunch menu, it’s still important to include dairy products to balance out a menu. Acceptable dairy products for brunch include cream cheese for bagels and yogurt parfait. Additionally, cheese can be mixed into casseroles and eggs for extra flavor.

, Coffee, tea, milk, and juice are staples of brunch.Be sure to supply options for sprucing up drinks such as sugar, cream, and flavorings. If you have a coffee maker, you can quickly whip up a pot of an inexpensive roast. Otherwise, you can purchase a jug from a breakfast shop., Because brunch straddles breakfast and lunch, you have the option to serve less traditional protein choices. Try including heavier meat options like steak or prime rib.If you have a buffet-style service, include a carving station. Allow the meat to rest on a cutting board, carve a few slices ahead of time, and make the carving knife readily available if needed. For sit-down services, you can carve the meat ahead of time.You can also get away with serving seafood by including items such as cured salmon for lox and crab dip for crostini’s., Seasonal vegetables are fresh vegetables that are only available during certain seasons. Each year’s offering is different, and individual varieties of vegetables have different harvest times.You can check your local farmer’s market for availability.


A great cooking method for most vegetables is to roast them and serve them as a side dish. Additionally, they can be added to eggs and sandwiches.
Veggies are extremely versatile and work well as a refreshing cold dish or served raw. Try veggies served with cheese (tomatoes and mozzarella) or veggie “slaws” such as broccoli slaw.Store-brought platters are a quick and easy way to add veggies to the menu.

, A baguette or a loaf of bread is a quick and cheap way to bulk up your meal. Not only does it keep your guests entertained while you’re cooking, but it can also be used to make savory sandwiches or slathered in jam for a sweet alternative.


Toast the entire loaf for 10-15 minutes before serving.
Rub a bit of water over the crust with your hands if the bread gets too rubbery or soft., Because brunch straddles the line between breakfast and lunch, try pairing classics from both. For example, try pairing a sweet coffee cake with a savory dish like carved meat. This will not only offer your guests variety but will also keep them full for hours.The appeal of brunch is that it is a hodge-podge collection of food items. Feel free to pick and choose savory and sweet menu items even if you feel they don’t pair well together. Your guests might enjoy the variety.

, Finger foods are small bites of food that are flavorful, easy to fix, and easy to eat with your hands. Try egg mixtures baked into muffin bites, ham and cheese wraps, or sandwiches made on bruschetta or crostini.Not only are finger foods usually inexpensive, but they can also be prepared ahead of time and frozen.
Simple sandwiches are a great finger food. Choose your favorite meats, cheeses, and breads and slice into smaller portions to feed more guests.

, Aside from coffee and orange juice, pitcher drinks and punch bowls are great ideas to add an additional level of flavor. There are also many brunch menus that include alcoholic beverages such as mimosas or bloody marys.


Choose beverage options based on your guest list. For example, if many children will be present, milk and juice are maybe more appropriate than mimosas.
You can provide mixers and allow guests to bring their own bottle of liquor (BYOB) such as Vodka or champagne.Stay away from drinks that have to be repeatedly mixed or alcoholic drinks that are too strong."

Choose bars if convenience and feeling satisfied is important.,
Find a shake if you prefer sipping your calories.,
Make your own meal replacement.,
Look for meals with 250 to 350 calories.,
Find a meal replacement with lots of protein.,
Go for meal replacements with fiber.,
Look for replacements that are low in fat.,
Make sure the meal replacement is fortified with vitamins.,
Check for meal replacements that are low in sugar.,
Replace only one meal a day.,
Use a meal replacement at breakfast.,
Use meal replacements for short-term help.",How to Choose Meal Replacements," You can easily stow away meal replacement bars in your purse or suitcase, and they make a good choice if you value convenience. Meal replacement bars tend to help you feel more fully satisfied than liquid meal replacement options.You can find meal replacement bars at grocery stores, health stores, or online.;
, A meal replacement shake is a good option for you if you want to slowly sip a meal. They’re easily consumed on the go, but are sometimes bulkier and more inconvenient than bars.


Meal replacement shakes come in a variety of forms that might need freezing or refrigeration. Shakes that are stable at room temperature are the most common variety.

, A homemade meal replacement is a great option if you’re looking to save money and know exactly what’s going into your meal replacement. You can make either bars or shakes at home.Making your own meal replacement will help prevent the monotony that comes with eating the same meal every day. You can mix up the flavors of the smoothies or bars that you create.
Cooking meal replacements yourself is a creative way to begin understanding what ingredients contribute to healthy eating.
Try your hand at making your own shake with this easy recipe: blend together 1 avocado, 1 cup of spinach, 1 banana, 1 tablespoon (15 g) of natural peanut butter, 1 cup (236 mL) of milk, and 6 ice cubes to make two delicious meal replacement shakes., An important part of choosing a healthy meal replacement option is reading the nutrition label. Choose a meal replacement that is roughly 250 to 350 calories in total to ensure that you’re getting enough calories to replace your meal., Meal replacements should have a high amount of protein to help keep you full longer. Look for about 12 to 20 grams of protein per serving.

A meal replacement with an appropriate amount of protein will keep you satisfied for 3 to 4 hours., Meal replacements should contain about 3 to 5 grams of fiber. Like protein, fiber also helps keep you fuller for longer.You could also have a few veggies or fruit on the side of your meal replacement to boost fiber levels.

, Look for meal replacements with about 5 grams of fat per serving or less. You want to examine the fat content of your meal replacement for healthier fats. The best meal replacements will have more unsaturated fats, the healthy kind of fat, than saturated fats, the unhealthy kind., Meal replacements should contain a third of your daily recommended dose of vitamins and minerals.You should check to see if the nutrition label has 33% of each of the following: Vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K, calcium, magnesium, and potassium.The percentage of vitamins and minerals on nutrition labels is usually calculated based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

, Since many meal replacements are chocked full of sugar you should look for low sugar levels. High sugar levels aren’t useful for maintaining a healthy lifestyle.A healthy meal replacement bar won’t have much more than 3 grams of sugar., Replacing one meal a day is enough to make an impact on weight loss. Because no meal replacement can ever truly replace the benefits of eating a real meal, it’s best to limit their intake to ensure that your diet is well rounded.If you’re only using one meal replacement a day, you’ll have the opportunity to learn how to make healthier choices with your other meals. Then when you’re eventually not using meal replacements, you’ll know how to make healthy choices for all of your meals.You can only safely replace every meal with meal replacements under the supervision of a doctor who provides you with medical grade products., Because most people eat the same thing for breakfast every day, using your meal replacement at breakfast will reduce the monotony of eating the same meal replacement.If you’re prone to skipping breakfast, use your meal replacement for this meal since breakfast is the foundational meal for long-term weight control. People who eat breakfast are more likely to lose weight and eat less later in the day, because they start their day with the energy their bodies need., Meal replacements are best for helping you kick off weight loss. They can teach you portion control by helping you understand how much you should eat. They’ll also help you lose weight, which is a great motivator to encourage you to want to learn how to eat healthily for every meal. Learn how to develop healthy eating habits when you’re on meal replacements, so you don’t see the weight pile back on after you’ve gone off of them.Meal replacements aren’t great for long-term use because they’re monotonous, they’re expensive, and they’re not always readily available in real life situations like dining out."

Visit restaurants at closing time.,
Look for free events.,
Browse stores for free samples.,
Keep an eye out for new stores.,
Dumpster dive.,
Bargain.,
Find out about charity offers.",How to Get Free Food1," Most restaurants can't keep extra food after they close, so they trash all the food. If you ask nicely, some staff members will give you the food instead of throwing it away.;
, Free art shows and small, local concerts often serve food. If you live near a university, check bulletin boards or online event calendars. There are almost always public events happening, and many of them serve food.


A catered event for a private group might have extra food if you hang around near the end time.
Many religious services offer free food to anyone who attends the service.

, Some stores offer free samples of their products each day, or offer coffee or snacks for customers. Learn which ones do in your area and visit regularly. It might not be much, but at least it's something.


Some examples in the United States include Sam's Club, Costco, Trader Joe's, and BJ's.
Larger stores are less likely to care if you eat extra samples or visit daily. Small stores often kick you out if you eat samples without buying anything.

, Newly opened grocery stores, supermarkets, and restaurants may offer giveaways to attract customers. Sometimes, even stores that don't sell food will have a catered event on the opening day.

, A few bakeries, stores, and restaurants have ""food dumpsters"" or ""bread dumpsters"" that they only use for food, making it easy to pick up a clean meal. Even if you have to root through trash, sealed packages of food (that don't require refrigeration) are almost always good the day of their expiration date or a short time afterward.


Be cautious about discarded food that has not hit its expiration date, and does not have obvious physical damage. This may have been thrown out for health concerns.

, If you bargain well enough, you might get free food. Talk to a cashier or waiter before you've eaten the food or opened the packaging.

, The local government building may be able to tell you about local sources of free or very cheap meals. Some restaurants offer ""pay what you want"" meals, or special cheap meals for those in need. Soup kitchens and homeless shelters offer free meals, while food banks and community cupboards give away bags of kitchen ingredients.


St. Vincent's is one free restaurant with locations across the US.
Local churches and other religious buildings often host these giveaways or can direct you to local opportunities.

Grow an edible garden.,
Collect coupons or reward points.,
Offer to work for food.,
Ask the Department of Agriculture and ask about food giveaways.,
Apply for restaurant jobs.,
Volunteer for long-term programs.",How to Get Free Food2," Don't hesitate to ask neighbors, friends, and garden store employees for advice when you start out gardening. Even if you do have to pay for the seeds, they often cost very little. Plant any fruit or vegetable suitable for the local climate, and eat them once they are completely grown.



Grow square foot gardens if you don't have much space.

, If you collect enough coupons, you might eventually get a free or cheap product. Most stores only allow one coupon per item, so you're better off looking for a reward program.

, Hotels are often in need of staff, and may offer a meal in exchange for a few hours of dish washing. Don't expect a swanky establishment to take you in without references, though.

, They usually happen twice per month in rural areas of the US. Some farmers will allow you to ""glean"" their fields after the harvest is completed. Usually 25% of the remaining product is still quite usable.

, Most restaurant staff get free food every day. Typically, you get a free meal during your break, and may be able to take home extra food at the end of the day.

, Humanitarian aid organizations often need volunteers, and will feed and house you if you're willing to spend a long time working abroad. The army is another option if you meet the physical fitness requirements.

Make half your plate consist of vegetables and fruits.,
Aim for whole grains.,
Vary your protein sources.,
Add some low-fat dairy.",How to Balance a Meal1," Choose whole fruits and vegetables to consist of one half of any balanced meal. Try for 1 – 2 cups of fruit and 2 – 3 cups of vegetables per day.Whole fruits and vegetables can include fresh, frozen, or canned items with no other ingredients (like sugar or salt) added.
Equivalents of 1 cup of fresh fruit would be 1 cup of 100% fruit juice or ½ cup of dried fruit. Equivalents of 1 cup of fresh raw or cooked vegetables would be 1 cup of vegetable juice or 2 cups of leafy greens.
Choose vegetables from all five subgroups: dark green vegetables, red and orange vegetables, legumes (beans and peas), starchy vegetables, and other vegetables.;
, Make about a quarter of any balanced meal consist of grains, with at least half of those grains being whole rather than refined. Grains include food made from wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, barley or another cereal grain.


Easy examples of foods that fall into the grain category are bread, pasta, oatmeal, breakfast cereals, tortillas, and grits.
Whole grains are any grains that use the entire grain kernel, such as whole wheat flour, brown rice, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, and bulgur wheat. Look for “whole wheat” on the labels of food you eat, and favor these items over refined wheat products like white bread, white rice, etc.Aim for a minimum of 3 – 4 ounces of grain foods per day, or a recommended amount of 6-8 ounces. 1 ounce could be a ½ cup of pasta, rice, or oatmeal; one slice of bread; ½ an English muffin; or 1 cup of whole grain cold cereal., Choose proteins from a variety of different food sources for the healthiest level of nutrients. Aim for proteins to take up about a quarter of your plate for any balanced meal.


Eat both animal proteins and plant proteins. Animal proteins include meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs. Plant proteins include beans and peas, nuts, seeds, and soy. Choose different plant and animal proteins for each meal or day so that you get a wide variety.
Aim for about 5 – 6 ounces of protein foods per day. 1 ounce of protein could look like 1 ounce of lean meat, poultry, or fish, or a ¼ cup cooked beans or tofu.Note that proteins like seafood, nuts, and seeds can also be good sources of oils, which are another essential addition to balancing a meal.
Look for meat and poultry that are low in fat and added sodium. Eat unsalted nuts and seeds., Drink or eat milk products to receive the calcium and other nutrients present in cow’s milk. Favor low-fat versions to reduce fat intake.


Aim for about 3 cups of dairy per day. A cup of dairy could mean 1 cup of milk, yogurt, or soymilk; 1 and ½ ounces of natural cheese; or 2 ounces of processed cheese.
Dairy products are generally considered to be all foods made from cow’s milk; however, products like butter, cream cheese, and cream are not generally considered part of this food group for nutritional purposes due to their low calcium content.And butter and cream are really made from fat.

Eat like a backpacker.,
Eat raw or go paleo.,
Get creative with salads.,
Get creative with sandwiches.,
Use microwaveable foods and meals.,
Make friends with people who love to cook.,
Purchase food to-go.",How to Survive Without Cooking," Use whole foods that require no stove (and for some, no fridge!), like fresh or dried fruits, nuts, seeds and long-lasting veggies like carrots, cabbage and peppers. Choose healthy options to spice up the veggies such as yogurt, hummus, salsa and dips. Other backpacker options include energy bars, granola bars, health food store cookies, bread, cans of beans and pre-made salads.


Eat fresh each day and replenish your larder on the way home from work or college, as part of your daily routine. Never over-supply your kitchen––just as a backpacker keeps moving to a new destination and can't be weighed down by too much food, be mindful of only having sufficient to eat for the next few days, always keeping your intake fresh.
This approach works best for those in urban areas, or where it's easy to replenish your food supply direct from a garden or local supplier.;
, Growing interest in the raw food movements and paleo diets has revealed just how far modern humans have divorced themselves from the healthy foods nature intended for us to eat. By eating more raw food or following a paleo style diet, you will reconnect with some very healthy choices as well as avoid cooking much of the time.


Do note that if you want to puree or blend nuts, seeds and fruits, for example, that there is some preparation involved.
Be picky and choose the things that can be eaten fairly much in the state they were grown with little change required by you.

, Many of us have neglected eating our greens to the detriment of our health. The health benefits of adding more fiber to your diet include lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol levels, improved insulin sensitivity, enhanced weight loss (in obese individuals) and enhanced immune function.You don't have to stick to the typical garden salad either. Try pizza salad, caprese salad and ambrosia fruit salad.

, Try as many different kinds of good quality bread (not the sliced white stuff that has had all life processed out of it), meats, veggies, cheeses and condiments as you can think of. Try your favorite breads cold, toasted, open faced, warmed in the microwave or dipped into extra virgin olive oils.


Explore different ways of making sandwiches. Don't be afraid to try sweet fillings such as sliced fruit or spread lemon curd.
See these sandwich suggestions for lots more sandwich ideas to inspire you.

, Buy food or pre-made meals that you can put in the microwave to heat up, along with a good dose of fresh food such as an accompanying salad or some lightly steamed veggies. Be sure to read the labels though––many microwave meals are high in saturated or trans-fats, sugar, salt and artificial additives.


For better quality microwave meals and fresh items, try a local delicatessen, specialist bakery or gourmet foods store, where they make microwave meals and fresh salads, etc. for takeout.

, They may invite you to their house for dinner together, especially if you're upfront about not enjoying cooking but loving other people's efforts!


Be sure to reciprocate as best you can. For example, offer to pay for ingredients or simply turn up with armfuls of healthy, fresh ingredients for their pantry and fridge.
Shout your home-chef friends to a restaurant meal once in a while, to make up for all the homemade cooking you've enjoyed at their place.
Visit more restaurants with friends to explore different flavors and cuisines. You will pay less for more variety if you go Dutch on pizza, Chinese, Indian food, and so forth. Try to make this a regular event, such as a once every two weeks, or once a month.

, Many entree-sized meals from restaurants have two meals worth of food. However, don't live off takeout food, as commercially produced fast food tends to be a lot higher in trans- and saturated fats, salt, sugars and artificial flavorings and colorings. You don't need all those unhealthy, nutrition-deficient fillers in your body. Aim to eat healthier options, such as cheese-free veggie pizzas, Asian stir-fries, falafel plates and salads.


In some places, to-go means that there is no service gratuity (tips) required and this will save you money.

Eat a substantial breakfast.,
Plan ahead for lunches and dinners.,
Remember to balance snacks.",How to Balance a Meal2," Keep your morning meal balanced with enough food to represent a variety of food groups and start your metabolism working for the day.


Start with milk and cold or hot cereal, then top with pieces of fruit and nuts or seeds to create an easy breakfast that contains grains, dairy, fruit, and protein. Avoid sugary cereals or sweetened fruits.
For a hot breakfast, try an omelet with two eggs or ½ cup of egg substitute; ½ cup of vegetables (like chopped broccoli, bell pepper, and onion, for example); and 1 ounce of reduced-fat cheese. Serve with a whole grain English muffin., Buy ingredients for healthy meals for the week ahead of time. Prep several portions of food to eat throughout the week, or eat dinner leftovers for lunch the next day, for a way to save time but still eat well.For a quick lunch, try a sandwich with two slices of whole grain bread, lettuce, onion, tomato, a slice of low-fat cheddar cheese, and a few slices of lunch meat. A side salad with two tablespoons of salad dressing and a single cup of 100% fruit juice could complete the meal.
For a simple balanced dinner, try 1 cup of cooked carrots, 1 cup of steamed string beans, 1 cup of cooked brown rice, and a single grilled pork chop. Water or low-fat milk could serve as a healthy drink.
When planning meals and shopping for ingredients, reduce or eliminate pre-packaged or prepared foods, sodas, salty snacks, and dessert foods. You’re more likely to make balanced meals when healthy, whole foods are on hand, without substituting for easy processed foods.

, Don’t forget to make snacks between meals as balanced as possible. You may not include all food groups in every small snack, but each snack should contain more than one type of food.


For example, try a snack of apple slices and celery sticks with peanut butter to dip them in for a healthy snack that contains, fruit, vegetables, and some protein and oil.
Eating snacks can be a great way to get a full day’s worth of balanced nutrients if you get hungry between meals or have trouble eating substantial meals to contain enough food from each food group.

Calculate the number of calories you need.,
Always consult a doctor about health conditions.,
Make substitutions for allergy or other restrictions.",How to Balance a Meal3," Determine the unique number of calories you need and quantity of foods you should have based on your age, sex, size, and activity level. Tailor your meals to fit the USDA recommendations based on these factors.Consider that your “ideal” number of calories or portion sizes can change considerably, or be altered by a need or desire to lose or gain weight, get more of a key nutrient you’re deficient in, or other specific health factors.
Every meal should remain balanced with proportional amounts of food from different food groups. Don’t substitute large amounts of protein just to get more calories, for example, or completely cut out a food group if you’re trying for less calories.

, Go to the doctor regularly, and discuss any acute or chronic health conditions you may have. Ask questions about the foods you should be eating or avoiding due to the condition, which may alter the portions of your typical balanced meal.


For example, diabetics may be advised to opt for whole grains over refined grains and restrict their dietary intake of fruits and fruit juices. Those with high cholesterol and heart disease may make animal products and fatty foods a smaller amount of their daily intake. Those needing to lose weight may put a heavier emphasis on vegetables and reduce the use of butter, oil, shortening, sugar, or salt when cooking.
Never assume an alteration to your diet based on general knowledge of a health condition is right for you until you consult a health professional about it.

, Take allergens into consideration if you have a bad reaction to any types of food. You may also need to eliminate or substitute foods based on other health conditions.


If you are lactose intolerant, include lactose-free or lactose-reduced dairy products, or substitute cow’s milk for non-dairy milks such as those made with almond, soy, coconut, rice, etc. Look for calcium-fortified foods and beverages, or foods naturally high in calcium like sardines, tofu, tempeh, kale, collard greens, and other leafy greens.If you are a vegetarian or have other restrictions on animal products, eat more plant proteins like beans and peas, nuts and seeds, and soy products to account for your daily protein intake.
Keep meals balanced as best as you can given any other elimination or restriction of allergens. Consult with a doctor or dietician to get recommendations on how to meet nutrition requirements with your specific limitations.

If you live in a college dorm, you may be required to buy a meal plan.,
If you are living in an apartment still consider buying a meal plan.,
Pack food from home.,
Consider going out to eat.,
After having done all this, count the total number of meals you plan to eat per week and subtract the total number of meals accounted for by steps 2, 3 and 4.,
After Step 5, if you still have any meals unaccounted for, consider cooking at home.",How to Arrange for Meals While in College,"  Since you likely have limited access to cooking ware, this is a good idea.  But always keep spare snacks like chips, fruits, nuts, bread, jelly, coffee, tea, honey, and microwavable ramen noodles in store just for those nights when you don't feel like going to the dining hall.;
,  It may cost more but it can help you in the long run.  Consider your schedule.  If you have a heavy course load and many activities/a job, will you still have time to cook every night and shop for ingredients frequently?  Perhaps you can buy a limited meal plan and budget out a set number of meals per week.

,  Taking ingredients from home (with parental permission)-can reduce the amount of time you spend shopping for them.  Ask a parent to make a few dishes for you and take them to your apartment and freeze them.  You can retrieve these months later.  Also budget these between the number of weeks until you can go home next-decide to use this food for X number of meals per week.

,  In excess, this will cost a lot of money, but once or twice a week-especially if one is from a fast food place and the other is carry out to save time-can really help.

,  Don't count breakfast or snacks: items like bread, cheese, peanut butter, jelly, milk, cereal, coffee, tea, honey, crackers, chips, and canned soups can be purchased in bulk cheaply.

,  If it's only three to four meals, this can be done simply.  For one meal, you could simply eat ramen noodles, for another, eat breakfast for dinner-a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with cereal won't be that bad for dinner.  Consider buying a crockpot.  All you need to do is place spaghetti in there for one night and perhaps frozen, pre-sliced vegetables, hot sauce, and meat of your choice with pasta another night-and dinner is ready!

Take inventory of your stock at home.,
Start a garden.,
Make a detailed list.,
Clip coupons.,
Shop sales.,
Buy in bulk.",How to Cook Cheap Meals1," In most cases, a dinner that involves five ingredients will cost less than one that requires ten. Search for recipes that only use a few ingredients and do not require anything too exotic.;
, Plenty of people are interested in learning how to cook inexpensive meals, and cookbook publishers know it. Budget cookbooks can provide you with a plethora of low-cost meal ideas.

, Before you plan out your meals, look at the ingredients you already have at home. Comb through your spice cabinet and your pantry. If you have any product nearing its expiration date, plan a meal that will allow you to use it. Likewise, if you have an excess amount of any given product, plan a meal using that, as well.

, You can grow a number of herbs, vegetables, and fruits even with limited space. If you plan on cooking budget meals for a long time, starting a garden now is a good way to save on produce costs later on.

, Once you decide on your meals for the week, make a detailed list of everything you need. Mark down every ingredient you do not already have in your pantry, and jot down sizes and quantities as applicable. Do not go shopping without a list, since you may forget some items or walk away with something you do not need.

, Look through junk mail, magazines, and online for coupons that offer you savings on the products you need. Be careful about what coupons you use, though. Some brands may cost more than others even with a coupon. Always compare prices instead of assuming that the product with a coupon offers the best bargain.

, Most chain grocery stores have weekly sales. Many stores have pamphlets that they send out via mail or keep inside the store. Flip through these sale pamphlets to learn what products are on sale this week and plan meals that could use those products., If there is a certain product you cook with frequently, such as vegetable oil or salt, consider buying large quantities of it to save on the cost per serving. Compare prices of the bulk amount with the smaller amount to ensure that you receive a bargain. Also make sure to only buy bulk products you can actually use before the expiration date.

Buy whole chicken or bone-in chicken instead of boneless.,
Opt for tougher cuts of meat.,
Cook with cheaper forms of protein, like eggs and beans.,
Get more out of your meal by using rice or pasta.",How to Cook Cheap Meals2," More often than not, the generic store brand of any given product costs less than the name brand, even though the two products are virtually identical.

, Fruits and vegetables that are in season are priced to sell, so they cost less than produce not in season. For instance, corn-on-the-cob can cost up to ten times more out of season than it does during the summer months, when it is in season.

, Frozen and canned products cost less than their fresh counterparts and are usually just as nutritious. In fact, since these products are picked at the peak of ripeness, they may even contain more nutrients than partially ripe fresh produce. Go with frozen produce for the healthiest option, since it usually contains fewer preservatives than canned foods.

, Fresh seafood can be very expensive. By comparison, canned tuna and salmon are quite cheap, and they also contain high amounts of protein and helpful omega-3 fatty acids., Boneless, skinless chicken breasts are convenient to prepare, but this convenience will cost you extra. Bone-in pieces and whole chickens will save you on cost per serving. You can even remove the bones before you cook the chicken and save them to make stock later on.

, Tougher cuts of meat, like beef chuck roasts and pork shoulders, cost less than tender cuts. Slow cooking these meats using low heat can make them just as delectable, though. Try preparing a stew or slow-cooker meal using these cuts.

, In general, meat can be rather expensive. Eggs and beans are both healthy alternatives that offer high levels of protein at significantly cheaper prices.

, Both products are already fairly cheap. Moreover, they can usually be bought cheaper in bulk and have extended expiration dates. Enhance stews and stir-fries with pasta or rice, or prepare them for a simple side dish.

Include a variety of foods from the major food groups.,
Use a variety of ingredients, flavors and textures.,
Take proper portion sizes into account.,
Avoid foods that are very high in fat, sugar, calories and sodium.,
Address the dietary needs of different age groups.",How to Consider the Factors when Planning Meals1," A balanced diet requires eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and lean protein (this includes beans and other legumes, nuts and seeds).Most of the foods you eat every day should fit into one of these categories.


Try to make plant-derived foods such as whole grains, vegetables and fruits the foundation of every meal.After establishing a basis of plant-derived foods for a meal, then add in a moderate amount of low-fat dairy and lean protein items.;
, Since calories, nutrients and fiber content of foods in the same food group can differ dramatically, good nutrition depends on getting a variety of different foods from within the food groups.


Mix up it by using an assortment of colors, shapes, flavors and textures.The diversity in your choices will also make meals more interesting and appealing for everyone.

, When people are faced with overly large portions, they tend to overeat.Check the packages of foods you’re preparing to about serving sizes and follow the guidelines. Unless you intend to make a lot of food so that there will be leftovers, try to follow basic serving size guidelines.


One serving of meat or fish is approximately 3 ounces.One serving of dairy is approximately 1 cup.
One serving of vegetables is approximately 1 cup raw and ½ cup cooked.
One serving of whole grains is 1 slice of bread, 1 cup of dry cereal, and ½ cup cooked rice, cereal and pasta.
One serving of fruit is 1 medium sized fresh piece (approximately the size of a baseball) and ¼ cup dried.

, While they can’t be eliminated completely, a healthy, balanced diet includes a very low percentage of these types of foods. Our bodies need fat, but try to mostly choose healthy fats for your meals.


A few healthy fat options are avocados, salmon, albacore tuna, nuts and peanut butter., Teenagers and adults over the age of 50 need a lot of calcium in their diets. Small children, adolescent girls, and women of childbearing age need plenty of iron, which you can get from lean meats and cereals (with added nutrients).Women trying to become pregnant need extra folic acid.
Elderly adults need to take in extra vitamin D.

Choose your drinks carefully.,
Choose simple appetizers.,
Choose your main course.,
Choose a simple dessert.,
Have a backup plan.",How to Plan a Romantic Dinner at Home1," If you're planning to have a romantic dinner at home, then the first thing you'll do is have a drink to inaugurate the start of your nice home-cooked meal. Wine is the most romantic choice, so if you and yours are wine drinkers, be prepared with a bottle of red or white wine (or more), depending on what you're eating. Red wines tend to go best with steak and other meats, while white wines are better on summer evenings and go well with lighter foods like shrimp or salads. If you're having a more casual meal or just really like beer, then beer is fine, too.


If you plan to drink beer, white wine, or another beverage that should be cold, make sure to put it in the fridge well in advance.
You should also prepare some water with lemon in it for a nice touch. Put a pitcher of cold water on the table. You don't want to run to the fridge for water in the middle of the meal.;
, After you pour your drinks, you should be ready with some simple appetizers. You don't want to spend an hour sipping your drinks and standing around waiting for the food to be ready. Though preparing food together -- or some of it -- is part of the fun of having a romantic dinner at home, it won't be much fun if you're both too hungry to feel romantic. Having a few simple appetizers ready, or planning for very simple treats that are easy to assemble, will get your meal off on the right foot. Pick simple finger foods that are fun and easy to eat while you're in the kitchen. Here are some perfect appetizers to try:Make some bruschetta earlier in the day. All you need is a baguette, garlic, olive oil, onion, tomatoes, and a few other simple ingredients.
If you're feeling fancy, you can make deviled eggs the night before and enjoy them while you wait.
Prepare some home-made guacamole (or buy it) earlier in the day and serve it with a small bowl of tortilla chips.
For the summer, make simple salad with four ingredients: watermelon, feta cheese, sunflower seeds, and mint.
Hummus with pita chips and fresh veggies is always a big hit.
Though cheese and crackers are traditionally eaten at the end of a meal, mix things up and enjoy a plate of them as an appetizer. Gouda, brie, and fontina are great cheeses for crackers.

, Your main course should be something simple that doesn't require a lot of prep -- or something that you prepared, or partially prepared earlier in the day, so it only takes about 45 minutes or so to finish the meal. If you're making home made pizza, start the dinner with all of the ingredients out and your oven preheated, so all you have to do is place the ingredients on the pizza together and place it in the oven. Here are some other things to keep in mind as you choose your main course:Sautéed chicken and vegetables are a good candidate for a romantic dinner at home. Just make sure you wash, marinate, and bread the chicken in advance so you don't take up too much time.
Baked salmon with rice and brussels sprouts is another great option for your home-cooked meal.
If you're choosing pasta, instead of messier spaghetti or fettuccine, choose penne pasta, tortellini, orzo, or ravioli, which will be easier to eat.
Don't make foods that require too many ingredients and which will require a lot of cleanup during or after dinner. You may love making your mother's twelve-layer lasagna, but it will take all night and will leave a mess.
Choose foods that are aphrodisiacs for an even more romantic night. These foods include oysters, almonds, basil, and asparagus
Don't cook with too much garlic or onion, or you may not be feeling so romantic after your meal. The same goes for foods that are too rich and creamy, which will leave you feeling bloated.
Avoid foods that are too messy to eat, like lobster or French Onion Soup. If you made a salad, make sure that the lettuce is chopped well so it's not hard to get it in your mouth.
As you choose your main course, you should think of something simple that your date can do to help you out, whether it's to chop celery and tomatoes, or to put together a simple salad.

, If you've done a good job with the wine, appetizers, and main course, then chances are that you won't have much room in your stomach by dessert time. Instead of preparing an elaborate dessert, just pick up some cupcakes from your favorite local bakery or put some ice cream in the freezer and serve it with whipped cream and a handful of raspberries and blueberries.

, Though your romantic dinner at home should go as smoothly as possible, you should have a backup plan just in case. This doesn't mean that you should have another home-cooked meal prepared, but it does mean that you should have a safety plan in case something goes wrong. This could just mean having the menu to your favorite sushi restaurant or popping a frozen pizza in the fridge. If you're stuck at home with no other food and no other options, then you may be in trouble.

Take advantage of local farmers' markets.,

Focus on how to make your summer cooking more healthy.,

Grill fruits, vegetables and fish instead of meat.,

Eat light.,

Use fruit in different ways.,

Use more berries in your cooking.,

Eat more trail mix snacks or fruits.,

Keep the kids happy with fruit popsicles or fruit flavored ice cubes.,

Re-hydrate with water.",How to Prepare Healthy Summer Recipes," If you're not already familiar with a local farmers' markets, look for one. They're a large gathering of tent or stall food vendors and merchants whom sell fresh and farm-made produce at prices that are often better than the supermarket. Some of the most common foods sold at farmer's markets include potatoes, apples, bananas, green beans, fresh berries, peaches and other stone fruits, lots of greens, and corn husks, although the list is endless really! Specialty items that you might find at a farmer's market include honey, jams, olive oils, boutique or gourmet produced meats, breads, dips, infused oils, and more. Some vendors are ethnic food orientated, such as Indian, Thai, Korean, or Spanish, providing you with the opportunity to try foods you've not yet tasted.

You can find out more about your local farmer's market by searching online, or calling your local chamber of commerce or municipality for more information.
Even if the produce isn't as cheap as a supermarket, the benefit of a farmer's market is freshness, low mileage in terms of getting the produce from farm to table, and direct support for local growers. All of these are good reasons to try a local farmer's market!;
, Summer is a time of relaxation and that atmosphere should also invade the kitchen. When focusing on methods for cooking, think easy. Some of the healthiest cooking ways are the easiest, such as raw food (salads, etc.), grilling, steaming, and barbecuing (which gets you out of the kitchen). Focus on using food at its freshest and on replenishing it quickly so that everything you eat still contains lots of nutrients.

Purchase a book on seasonal cooking. This will help you to easily pinpoint summer oriented recipes without having to flick through the entire book. Another easy approach is to buy what is in season and to search for recipes using that ingredient online; simple but not always thought of!

, Just about any vegetable, such as corn on the cob, peppers, asparagus, and onions can be easily grilled in minutes. Make fruit kebabs for kid lunches or put a slab of salmon on a grill instead of steak. Here are some ideas:

Grill halibut
Grill vegetables

Grill a veggie panini.

, You don't need to gorge yourself with a huge meal to be satisfied. Create healthy balanced salads as an appetizer or lunch. The possibilities of salad toppings and additions are endless, such as chopped pecans, low-fat salad dressing, dried fruit, and fresh vegetables., Rather than just peeling or cutting it up into pieces, drink fruit smoothies or use fruit as a salad ingredient. Follow some of these refreshing ideas:

Watermelon lemonade
Watermelon mint raspberry salad
Cherry pie salad

Banana smoothie.

, Berries are abundant during summer and they're really good for you. Strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and more can be used in hundreds of different ways. Here is just a small sample of ideas:

Strawberry salad
Banana raspberry pie
Blueberry julius
Strawberry dressing for salads
Fish with berries

Blueberry muffins.

, Nuts, raisins, and dried fruit are the best combinations for a treat or ""on-the-go"" snack. Drop an apple or a tangerine into your bag or a handful of grapes into a sandwich baggie. Having healthy options easily available will remove the temptation to eat nutrient-deficient foods in their place., Add fruit ice cubes to a glass of orange juice or fruit punch for more flavor., Try to stay away from energy and sports drinks, especially for children. Despite the fact that they may replenish electrolytes and fluids, they also contain carbohydrates and caffeine amounts that lead to obesity and high blood pressure. As well, curb the soda drinks and flavored milks. Water is healthy, rehydrates instantly and keeps your body in great shape."

Find out if anyone is vegetarian or vegan.,
Inquire about food allergies and intolerances.,
Find out if anyone is on a special diet for other health reasons.,
Inquire about religion-related food restrictions.",How to Consider the Factors when Planning Meals2," Vegetarians do not eat meat, poultry, or seafood. Some vegetarians don’t eat dairy, so make sure to get the details from them if you’re feeding a vegetarian. Vegans don’t eat meat, poultry, or seafood, or any other animal products (including milk and eggs).


Since their diets are somewhat restricted, vegans and vegetarians need a lot of variety in their food choices in order to meet their nutrition needs.
Some food options that are popular among vegetarians and vegans are kale, grains, nuts, legumes, and beans., Some people have negative, sometimes even life-threatening, reactions to specific kinds of foods, so make sure to ask about them. The Mayo Clinic names eggs, milk, peanuts, shellfish, tree nuts, soy and fish as some of the most common food allergens.Wheat is another big one.


Common food intolerances are lactose (which is in milk products), MSG and gluten (which is in bread, pasta, and many wheat products).

, People with heart disease, high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure need to avoid certain foods to maintain good health. Some of the major foods they should avoid are processed meats, highly refined and processed carbohydrates, and sodas and other types of sugary drinks.Diabetics also need to avoid certain foods to maintain proper insulin levels, so be sure to ask about this one, too.

, Some people don’t eat certain foods because of their religion. There are many different types of religions with food restrictions, and the restrictions themselves vary from religion to religion.


Some religions have food restrictions only at certain times of the year, so be sure to ask about the details.

Decide on the location.,
Plan to use your nice dishes.,
Choose your romantic decorations.,
Dress up.,
Avoid all distractions.",How to Plan a Romantic Dinner at Home2," You can always eat in the garden if you have one. This can be very romantic if the season of the year is right, and if you have a nice, bug-free garden. You can also eat in the kitchen, but then you will have to hurry to clean everything and make it look nice. If you can, pick a location where you don't normally eat, so the night feels special. If you have a ""fancy"" dining table that you never use, now's the time.

, You may have a nice set of crystal glasses and fancy plates, napkins, and silverware that you never use because they're only for special occasions. Well, the occasion is now -- bring them out and take pleasure in how much they add to the romantic atmosphere.

, Flowers, rose petals, and unscented candles will do the trick - you have many options and will just have to be creative. Remember that candles are essential for a romantic dinner, so light several candles and place them on or near the table. Flowers, such as elegant roses, are almost as important. They look really good at the table, whether it's something extravagant or simple. Just keep in mind that you should be able to look at each other over the table.


Playing some soft jazz or romantic music in the background can add to the romantic ambience as long as it's not too distracting.

, Before you start your dinner date, take a shower and put on some perfume or cologne. Dress up just like you were going out to dinner. Put on some casual, but nice clothes, and look refreshed and effortlessly attractive. Your partner will appreciate the effort, and the night will feel even more special. Just make sure you decide on a dress code with your partner before the date, so you both look equally fancy.

, Make a plan to avoid all distractions so that you and your date can be free to enjoy your delicious meal -- and each other's company. So, if you have kids, arrange to have a sitter watch them away from home well in advance. Other than that, turn off your phones, the television, and radio, and focus only on each other. If there's going to be a big game on that night and one or both of you is a big sports fan, you may want to reschedule your date so that you aren't distracted. Once all the distractions are put away, you can focus on having a romantic evening.

Compare different brands.",How to Choose Healthy Frozen Meals," Reading the nutritional facts label will give you information that you need to make an informed decision when selecting your frozen meal. The nutritional facts label contains relevant nutrition information, such as the fat and sodium content, vitamins, and serving size of your meal. Make sure to read recommended daily values and assess if the meal you plan on buying will give you the nutrition and energy you need for the day.


Note the serving size of your frozen meals, and adjust the values based on how much you eat.For example, if you have two servings in one package, you must multiply the calories by two to get an accurate account of how much you'll be eating.;
, Too much sodium or saturated fat can be tough on your heart and blood vessels and can lead to things like high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, and heart disease.Avoid frozen meals that have more than 700 mg of sodium or more than 4 grams (0.14 oz) of saturated fat per serving.Foods high in potassium promote good cardiovascular health and can combat the effects of sodium and saturated fat.Meals that are high in saturated fat and sodium include fried chicken, Hungry Man Frozen Meals, and Stouffer’s Cheese Ravioli., Companies are required to list the number of calories which make frozen foods good for those that have diets that require them to calculate their daily caloric intake.While it may be tempting to go for the meal with the least amount of calories, it's advisable to stay away from meals that have too little calories. Choose meals between 350 and 500 calories per serving, so that you can get the nutrition you need while maintaining your diet.


A meal that contains less than 200 calories won't give you the energy you need and you may be tempted to snack afterward.Low calorie frozen meals can lack fiber and necessary fats that keep you healthy., Purchase a frozen meal that has a variety of different foods to maintain a healthy and balanced diet. Things like whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables are the healthiest options to go for.Eating a healthy and balanced diet stabilizes your weight and keeps you mentally and physically happy.


Eat five portions of fruit and vegetables per day to get necessary nutrients into your system.
Women should have 45 g of protein per day while men should have 55.5 g per day.
Males should have 38 g of fiber per day and women should have 25 g on average., The ingredients list will key you into how natural the frozen meal is. Choose frozen foods with a short list of ingredients and preservatives.If you see too many artificial ingredients or flavors, consider choosing a different brand or meal.


Companies who utilize sustainable practices have fresher and healthier foods because they incorporate things like grass-fed beef and freshly caught fish in their meals.Some of the unhealthiest artificial ingredients found in many frozen meals include textured soy protein concentrate, carrageenan, maltodextrin, disodium inosinate, modified cornstarch, and disodium guanylate., Fried meals or meals with a creamy sauce or gravy are typically high in fat and sodium. Replace fried food with grilled or steamed variations. Certain frozen foods, like french fries, can be baked instead of fried to cut down on saturated fat.Meals that contain a creamy sauce like chicken pot pie can contain up to 14 grams of fat., Some frozen meals will come with a dessert. Instead of eating the dessert, replace it with a piece of fruit. Frozen meal desserts are often high in sodium and high fructose corn syrup while fruit is higher in fiber and has fewer calories.Healthy fruits include cantaloupe, strawberries, apples, and bananas., Consider any health problems that you've had in the past or have currently and try to develop your diet around what is good for you. For instance, if you have heart disease, you need to limit the amount of sodium and fat that you have each day and concentrate on eating a variety of vegetables, fruits, whole grains.The American Diabetes Association says that keeping a couple of healthy frozen meals in the freezer is a good idea for people with diabetes.Examples of healthy frozen meals for those with diabetes include turkey burgers, butternut squash ravioli, and Weight Watcher’s spaghetti with meat sauce., There are frozen alternatives for many different kinds of food. Choose the frozen equivalent of some of your favorite types of food. Try to find a meal that's both nutritional and tasty.


For example, if you enjoy Asian cuisine, consider going for the Chinese or Japanese frozen meals that are available, just make sure that you choose low sodium options.
If you hate a certain ingredient, make sure that it's not in the frozen meal that you want to buy.

, Even though some frozen foods can be cheaper per pound than their fresh counterparts, you still need to ensure that the frozen meals that you're getting are within your budget. Compare the different brands of frozen meals and calculate how much it will cost on a weekly and monthly basis. Choose the healthy choices that you can afford.

, Even though two frozen meals may be the same food, it doesn't mean that they taste the same. Try a variety of different types of frozen meals and different brands to see which ones you like the best. Make sure to stay within the proper nutritional value so that you can maintain healthy while eating something that you can enjoy.


Some of the healthiest frozen meal brands include, Earth’s Best, Plum Organics, and Kidfresh."

Plan ahead.,
Check out current grocery store sales.As you’re planning your meals, take into account which food products are on sale and where, and do your shopping at those places.,
Use seasonal fruits and vegetables.Not only will seasonal fruits and veggies be easier to find, they will also be available in abundance for a much lower price than usual.,
Incorporate foods that you already have and buy low-cost items.Check out what’s currently in your pantry.",How to Consider the Factors when Planning Meals3," The best way to stick to a budget is to plan your meals one week in advance.Decide which meals you want to make for the upcoming week and make a detailed grocery list of needed ingredients.


Be sure to take the list with you when you go shopping, so that you’ll only pick up the items that you need.

, By sticking to your shopping list and creating planned meals around sales, you can save even more money.


Don’t forget to check the newspaper for coupons and additional ways to save.

, When they’re in season, fruits and veggies tend to be at their tastiest, making them ideal foods to stock up on.


When fruit and vegetables aren’t in season, buy canned or frozen varieties, which are generally cheaper while still offering great nutritional benefits.
Along with your local grocery stores’ produce section, also check out any farmer’s markets in your area for even more options and organic produce at a low price.

, For instance, do you have some canned food items pushed to the very back of your pantry that have been in there awhile? Plan a few meals around those.


According to the USDA, the least-expensive vegetables are eggplants, lettuce, carrots and tomatillos.The least-expensive fruits are apples, peaches, pineapples, pears, bananas and watermelon.
For low-cost sources of protein, opt for canned tuna, ground beef and eggs.

"
Plan according to how much time you have to cook.,
Make sure you have the right equipment.,
Confirm that the ingredients can be easily attained.Avoid recipes that require fruits and vegetables that are out of season.,
Avoid elaborate food preparation unless you have help.",How to Consider the Factors when Planning Meals4," Take into account how much time you have each day to cook. For instance, if you work 8 or more hours per day, you’re going to have less time available for preparing meals. Plan meals that are faster and easier to prepare.


Invest in a crock pot. You do a quick prep the night before, toss everything in the crock pot the next morning, turn it on and you're done! When you arrive back home later that evening, your meal will be waiting for you.Cook large batches and freeze portions for later meals.
Use canned items, like beans, for a quicker meal prep. No hours of soaking required.When you're short on time, use frozen vegetables instead of fresh. Frozen veggies are still nutritious, and you'll save tons of prep time.Explore new recipes that incorporate baking, grilling and sauteing. Baking casseroles, for example, generally requires a short prep time and once you pop it in the oven, you don't have to babysit it.

, Be certain that you have the cookware, utensils, dishes and other items required for the meals you’re planning on hand before you buy all of the ingredients to make them. If you are planning large meals with the intention of having leftovers, make sure you have enough storage containers and Tupperware to accommodate everything.

, Also avoid recipes that require gourmet ingredients or any other hard-to-find items.


If you’re planning large meals, make sure the ingredients you need can be easily obtained in large quantities.

, If you’re cooking alone, don’t plan elaborate or complex meals that require a lot of preparation. Plan meals that you can easily handle yourself, unless you have people around in your house that can assist you.

Look for lemons that are fully ripe. A ripe lemon will feel heavy for its size, be bright yellow, and have a skin that is textured with a finely grained peel.;
, If you do not have it, buy some from your grocery store. Extra virgin oil is best because it tastes light and can be used to cook with almost anything.


Plan to use about 3 cups (24 oz.) of oil to the 6 lemons. Many olive oil bottles come in a 1 liter (0.3 US gal) size, and this will work as well.

, Allow them to dry by patting them with a paper towel or leaving them on a cutting board to air dry.

, Throw out any peels that have pieces of lemon flesh on them. Only the peel can be used in the infusion process, no fruit at all.

, If any moisture goes into the olive oil on the lemon peel, you will be at risk of growing bacteria or mold in your lemon olive oil.

, If you are presenting the lemon olive oil as a gift, choose a decorative jar or something fancy.


Look for a 1 qt. (.95 L) jar for this method. If you start with fewer or more lemons and oil, you will have to adjust or use several jars.

, Seal the jar tightly.

, Keep the jar in a cool, dry place out of direct sunlight.

, You can discard the lemon peel that was used to infuse the oil with the lemon flavor.

,, Recipes can be found in cookbooks and online, at sites such as The Food Network, Cooking.com and Epicurious.


Attach a recipe card with the jar of lemon olive oil if you are giving it away as a gift. Handwrite or print the recipe and ingredients on a small note card, and attach it to the bottle or jar with a piece of ribbon.

Replace fresh rosemary with dried rosemary.,
Replace fresh mint with dried mint.,
Substitute dried cilantro for fresh cilantro.",How to Make Herb Substitutions1," If your recipe calls for a tablespoon of fresh oregano or any other herb, you can substitute it with a teaspoon of the dried herb.Dried herbs have a more concentrated flavor, so remember to use less of them than the recipe calls for fresh herbs.Fresh herbs are often used to give the dish a lively and fresh flavor, so be aware that using an herb substitution will make the dish taste different. The flavors will be more concentrated but you won’t get the liveliness offered by fresh herbs.;
, Remember that dried sage has a more concentrated flavor, so you should use a third of the fresh sage that the recipe asks for.

, Rosemary is often used in baking, sauces, and on meats in Mediterranean dishes. If you run out of fresh rosemary, you can always use the dried variety.Remember to only use a third of the amount of fresh rosemary called for in the recipe.

, Mint is a wonderful addition to savory dishes and is used in many desserts as well as drinks like tea or a mojito. If your recipe calls for a tablespoon of chopped fresh mint, add a teaspoon of the dried variety in its place.

Replace summer savory with winter savory.Savory is used in a lot of Mediterranean cooking and especially with meats and bean dishes, as well as vegetable dishes with mushrooms.",How to Make Herb Substitutions2," Simply add a quarter teaspoon of either dried thyme or oregano for each bay leaf in your recipe.For example, if you need a bay leaf for your stew but have run out, you can always use a quarter teaspoon of either thyme or oregano to replace it.

, Caraway and cumin are related, since they are both in the parsley family. They also have a similar taste, although cumin has a nutty and smoky flavor whereas caraway has sweet and earthy tones.Start with a little less caraway than the recipe lists for cumin and then build it up to get the flavor profile you desire.You can also replace the cumin with ground coriander but you should be aware that it won’t be as smoky and nutty in flavor.The coriander will give it more of a lemony flavor., If you need a substitute for fresh cilantro, you can use an equivalent amount of fresh parsley, tarragon, or dill. Alternately, combine a bit of all three to replace an equal amount of cilantro. The substitute works best for garnishes., If you need to replace coriander seed or ground coriander, you can use an equivalent amount of cumin, fennel or caraway seeds.

Substitute rosemary for sage. Rosemary has more pine and citrus tones than sage but can work fine.
Substitute thyme for sage. It has more mint notes than sage but will work nicely.
Substitute savory for sage. It has a similar peppery flavor to sage so use it if you want to really bring out the peppery side of a dish., Winter savory has a bit of a stronger taste so keep that in mind when adding the summer savory. You can also use any of the following substitutions:


Replace summer savory with thyme and a little bit of mint.

Poultry seasoning has a similar flavor profile, partly because it contains sage alongside other herbs. Use the same amount of poultry seasoning as your recipe calls for sage.Some poultry seasonings contain salt so you may need to adjust the recipe to keep it from being too salty.

, This way you can get some cumin in your recipe, since cumin is contained in chili seasoning, but you should be mindful of the other spices in chili seasoning. These other spices include cayenne, paprika, garlic and onion powder.You can also substitute cumin with garam masala. This spice mix contains cumin as well as coriander, cardamom, black pepper, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. It sometimes also includes additional spices such as fennel. Start with half as much as you planned to use of cumin, and then build it up until you get a good taste in your recipe., If you run out of Ras el hanout spice mix, you can always make your own. Mix equal parts paprika, coriander, ginger and a pinch of saffron.Alternately, you could just use ground coriander as a substitute for Ras el hanout. It will not have the same complexity but should work fine., If you run out of bahārāt spice mix, you could make your own with equal parts paprika, cumin and cinnamon.


You could also just replace bahārāt spice mix with cumin., If you run out of garam masala for your dish, you can always just use some black pepper or mild curry powder to add some heat.You could also replace garam masala by making a version using as many of the ingredients usually found in it as you can find in your home. Toast two tablespoons of coriander; one tablespoon each of cumin, cardamom, and whole black peppercorns; one teaspoon each of fennel and mustard seed; half a teaspoon of whole cloves; and two dried red chile peppers over medium heat for two minutes.

Spoon or vegetable peeler
Mandolin
Large saucepan
Strainer
Candy thermometer
Wire cooling rack, greased
Baking sheet
Large bowl
Airtight container for storage;
, You need to remove the skin from the ginger before crystallizing it, and one of the easiest ways to do this is with a spoon. Place the side of the spoon against the ginger root, and gently scrape away the skin.You can use a knife or vegetable peeler for this job instead.
Vegetable peelers can be awkward to maneuver around all the knobs and bumps on ginger, and knives often take off too much flesh.

, Set your mandolin to one-eighth inch (3 mm). Place the ginger on the board and use the pusher to run the ginger over the blade. Collect the ginger slices and place them into a large saucepan.Use a sharp knife to slice the ginger into thin rounds if you don’t have a mandolin.
You can also cut the ginger into small cubes if you prefer.

, Add the water to the saucepan with the ginger slices. Put the lid on, and bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. When the water boils, reduce the temperature to medium and simmer for 30 minutes.The ginger is ready when it’s tender to the touch and can easily be pierced with a fork.
When the ginger is cooked, remove the pan from the heat.

, Remove about 1 cup (237 ml) of water from the saucepan and set it aside. Pour the ginger into a strainer to drain out the rest of the water. Return the ginger to the pot, along with the cup of water you reserved., Add the sugar to the pot with the ginger and water. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring regularly to prevent burning. When the mixture boils, reduce the heat to medium. Continue cooking, uncovered, for about 30 minutes, until the syrup reaches 225 F (107 C).When the syrup reaches the right temperature, remove the pan from the heat immediately.
You can substitute honey in place of the sugar to make this recipe., Place the greased cooling rack on top of a baking sheet. Spread the ginger pieces out over the cooling rack, letting the extra syrup fall down onto the baking sheet. With a fork, gently separate the ginger pieces so they can dry and cool.


Set the ginger aside to cool for one to two hours. You want the ginger pieces sticky enough that sugar will adhere to them, but not so wet that the coating will slide off., When the ginger is cool enough to handle, transfer the slices to a large bowl. Sprinkle in enough sugar to coat the ginger pieces in a thin layer of sugar. Toss or stir to distribute the sugar evenly and coat the slices.


Transfer the ginger back to the cooling rack. Let the slices sit overnight to cool completely., Once cool, you can enjoy your crystallized ginger immediately. If there is any ginger leftover, transfer it to an airtight container.


The ginger will keep at room temperature for two to four weeks., When you place the ginger on the cooling rack to dry, the baking sheet below will catch any excess syrup that drips off. Similarly, when you toss the ginger in sugar, any excess sugar will collect at the bottom of the bowl. Both ginger syrup and sugar can be used in drinks, baking, and other recipes.Collect the syrup when the ginger cools and no more excess is dripping off. Remove the baking tray from under the cooling rack and transfer the syrup to an airtight container.
After you transfer the sugared ginger slices back to the cooling rack, transfer any leftover sugar from the bottom of the bowl to an airtight container.

, Ginger sugar can be substituted for regular sugar in any recipe you like. Because the ginger sugar has been in contact with real ginger, it will have a spicy tang to it that will flavor other products.Ginger sugar can be used in hot drinks like tea and cold drinks like lemonade.
You can also use ginger sugar to coat the rim of glasses when you make cocktails.
Ginger sugar makes a great addition to baked goods as well. Simply sprinkle the ginger sugar on top of cookies or muffins in place of regular sugar.

, While true ginger ale is made with fermented ginger, you can make your own quick version by combining ginger syrup and soda water. Fill a tall glass with ice, pour in some soda water, and stir in some ginger syrup, to taste.If you have your own drink carbonator, you can also make your own ginger flavored soda water from scratch.

, Ginger syrup is a delicious and spicy substitute for maple syrup or honey. You can drizzle ginger syrup on pancakes, waffles, ice cream, fruit, and other breakfast and dessert favorites., A homemade cough syrup won’t get rid of your cold, but it will help to soothe your throat. Next time you're whipping up a batch, use ginger sugar in place of the sugar, or add a drizzle of syrup to the batch for some extra spice.

, Candied ginger is spicy and sweet, so it pairs well with desserts like ice cream. Next time you're serving ice cream or sundaes for dessert, garnish the bowls with a few pieces of candied ginger.You can cut the ginger slices into small slivers before sprinkling them on the ice cream.

, Ginger is also a spice that pairs well with certain savory dishes, particularly ones made with root vegetables and squash. To use candied ginger as a garnish on these dishes, slice or chop it into small pieces first. Great savory dishes you can use candied ginger on include:Candied yams
Squash or pumpkin soup
Mashed or roasted squash
Roasted carrots

, Many people like to use ginger for upset stomachs, including nausea, vomiting, aches, and motion sickness. Chewing on candied ginger can be a tasty treat and a comfort food when your stomach is upset.


Other common ways people enjoy ginger for an upset stomach include drinking ginger ale or ginger tea.

, Ginger pairs well with citrus fruits, and there's no better way to get your morning started than with a lemon and candied ginger muffin.

, You can substitute candied ginger for fresh ginger in any recipe that calls for fresh ginger. This includes tasty treats like gingerbread cake and gingered pumpkin cupcakes.

Pour your cooled oil into a bottle.,
Test your oil before using it.",How to Make Chili Oil," All chilies are not created equal, so you have options when it comes to your chili oil ingredients. While Thai chilies are quite spicy, Ancho chilies will give your oil a smokier flavor.California chilies are very mild, and guajillo chilies have spice with a citrus tang.Make sure you do a bit of research before selecting the chilies you’ll use for your chili oil.;
, Before deciding which oil to use for this recipe, you should determine that you’ll be using the chili oil for. If you’re going to be cooking with it, it’s great to use more neutral oils like vegetable or peanut oils. However, if you’re going to be using it as a topper for dishes, you might want to select something a bit more flavorful. In this case, a great olive oil or sesame oil can add an interesting flavor., Once you’ve figured out this basic recipe, don’t be afraid to get creative. Try new chilies and new oils to create different types of chili oils. Once you’ve discovered which combinations you like most, you can officially create your own, homemade chili oil for every occasion.

, For this recipe, you’ll want to use a small, heavy saucepan. Set your stovetop to medium heat. For now, you’ll only add this small portion of the oil to the pan. You don't need to get the oil sizzling – in fact, you definitely don't want to heat the oil this much. As soon as the oil is in the pan and the heat is turned on, you can move along to the next step., Cook these in the oil, stirring continuously. Don’t walk away from the pan, because it will not take long for the chilies to be ready. Once they start lightly sizzling, you’re ready for the next step.If the chilies turn brown, you’ll need to start over. The key is to heat them up enough so that their flavors will seep into the oil, but not to fully cook them.

, You’ll want to leave it on the stovetop until the oil is warm, but don’t get it any hotter than that. To see if the chili oil is ready, touch it with your finger. Begin touching the oil as soon as you pour it into the pan, while it is still room temperature. Touch it every thirty seconds or so after that, to avoid allowing it to get hot. As soon as it is warm to touch, remove it from the heat.If you're worried you left your oil on the stove too long and it may have gotten hot, remove it from the heat and let it sit for a bit before touching it with your fingertip. However, you really want to avoid letting it ever get hot.

, As soon as you’ve tested the oil and have confirmed that it’s thoroughly warmed, you’re ready to remove the pan from heat. Let it sit as it cools down to room temperature., You can purchase empty airtight bottles at most stores where kitchen supplies are sold. However, you can always clean out an empty bottle you have around the house. Repurpose an old olive oil bottle after thoroughly cleaning it with some water and dish soap.


Shake your bottle of chili oil sporadically to make sure the chilies are distributed throughout the oil., If you taste your homemade chili oil right after making it, it might taste pretty mild. However, the chilies will continue to release heat after you bottle it up. In other words, your chili oil can get gradually hotter the longer it sits! If you’re pouring it into a stir-fry, make sure you do a quick taste test first.Chili oil be stored from about 9 months to one year."

Seek out reliable recipes.,
Cook several recipes.,
Work through a cookbook.,
Prepare tougher recipes.,
Cook all your meals.,
Expand your palate.,
Watch cooking shows.",How to Be a Good Cook1," You need to read recipes before you can start to experiment in the kitchen. Even those cooks you know who claim they don’t use recipes, have read their fair share of recipes and even have some saved. A great way to find reliable sources is by researching a specific recipe.


Do an online search of something common like “chili” or “baked mac n’ cheese.”
Read several recipes and choose one that has a good online rating and that looks interesting to you.
Comments on websites aren’t reliable, but you can generally get a decent idea of how successful a recipe was due to the comments.
Ask for suggestions as well. Your friends who enjoy cooking probably have their favorite websites or cookbooks. Don’t be afraid to ask.
You should also ask your family members. There are certain family recipes that grandmothers like to keep in the family and are usually incredible.;
, Once you start to build a repertoire of credible recipes, start cooking. If you are new to cooking, try to cook as much as you can. Most recipes have a difficulty rating and you should use this as a guide and cook easy recipes. There is no need to start ambitiously by making homemade gnocchi. Try cooking some of these basic recipes:


Spaghetti and meatballs
Garlic bread
Frittata
Fried chicken
Burgers
French toastRead the entire recipe before cooking.

, It helps beginners and pros alike to have a printed out, edited recipe in front of them. Today there are several types of cookbooks that range on skill sets and cuisines. Take a bit of time to consider some of the following recommended cookbooks:


Afro Vegan by Bryant Terry.
The Ode to Southern Food by Edna Lewis
Momofuku by David Chang and Peter Meehan
The Zuni Cafe Cookbook by Judy RodgersThere are also great food blogs/websites like http://food52.com or http://smittenkitchen.com

, Once you start to become more familiar with cooking and recipes, you can set out to tackle more complex recipes. You might ruin one or two recipes as you work your way up to become a good cook. The point is to learn and overcome from difficulties in the kitchen. Many recipes termed “advanced,” merely require planning from you and sometimes need to be prepped the night before.


Try out some of these dishes that are considered difficult: paella, beef wellington, or mole.
These recipes will take a fair amount of time, but you will feel unstoppable if you can finish one of these.

, Improve your cooking skills by forcing yourself to only eat your own creations. This will help you master your favorite dishes, but it will also inspire you to create new flavors. Cook meals in large quantities to eat leftovers at work.


Cooking all meals takes planning and will power, but you will learn by cooking a lot!
Contain your urge to eat at your favorite restaurants by cooking a similar dish.

, A key to being a good cook is to be open to different cuisines from various cultures. You need to experience a wide variety of flavors to help foster your creativity as a cook. Go to a restaurant of a cuisine you have never tried like: Korean, Cuban, Indian, Ethiopian, or Mediterranean.


Talk to foodies for inspiration. Seek out your friend who thinks of herself as a foodie and ask for a restaurant recommendation. Try to go out to diner with this person to get even more of a food experience.

, Cooking shows are a great way to watch how recipes are made and offer plenty of helpful cooking tips. You can watch the food channel, which is exclusively reserved for television programs catered around cooking and food. There are also plenty of online videos about cooking that range from amateurs to professional chefs.

Adapt a recipe.,
Use spices with intention.,
Make a pan sauce.,
Create a saute.,
Learn how to caramelize.,
Sweat your vegetables.,
Blanch your veggies.,
Adjust the flavor.,
Don’t be afraid to experiment.",How to Be a Good Cook2," Many times, people who aren’t using a recipe have already made that dish by following a similar recipe. Once you’ve made a recipe a handful of times, try to cook it based on memory. By working through memory, you’ll adapt the recipe into your own dish.


If you enjoy a particular ingredient in a dish, like celery for example, then add more chopped celery to the dish.
Attempt to create a recipe based off the ingredients you own. Try adapting the recipe without buying extra supplies. It might work, or you could fail, but at least you tried.

, A well stocked spice rack can enhance impromptu creations. There are dozens of spices and combinations available to you. Use the following information about some classic spices to help you get started:


Basil is a sweet and earthy herb that has many types variants. Basil pairs well with Italian recipes (pasta, red sauce) and also works well in Asian stir fries with peanuts or coconut milk.
Curry powder is a variety of different herbs that is great for Indian dishes and varieties. Try curry powder in lentil stew, a breakfast scramble, or in rice/quinoa with cilantro.
Cumin is an earthy flavor with a bit of a spice. Cumin is perfect for Mexican dishes like tacos, black bean/refried beans, root vegetables, and on fish (tilapia).
Rosemary is sweet and woody. Rosemary goes well with many dishes like meats or potatoes. Rosemary is a good addition to any type of roasting with olive oil.
Thyme is an earthy herb. Thyme works well in any bean dish. It pairs well with other spices like bay leaves, lemon zest, and parsley., Take advantage of the residue left in your pan after cooking to create a delicious sauce to accompany your meal. This technique works best after searing meat in a pan. Remove the meat and any excess fat from the pan and turn the heat down to medium. Add some spices and herbs like a chopped shallot, garlic, and yellow mustard seed powder. Cook these down for about five minutes and then add some liquid.


One of the best liquids to absorb the pan’s remnants and create flavor is alcohol. Add about a ¼ cup of red/white wine or beer.
Cook the liquid down while stirring with a wooden spoon to blend all the remnants of the pan into the sauce. After 4-5 minutes throw in some lemon zest, thyme, or rosemary to complete a delicious accompaniment to your meal., Sauteing is the process of cooking food quickly at a high temperature in a shallow, wide pan. The key to sauteing is cutting all the ingredients into uniform size so that everything cooks evenly. You can saute meat, vegetables, and even fruit. Heat the pan to medium-high for about 10 minutes and then add your favorite oil/butter (2 tablespoons).Add your chopped food into the pan and cook for about ten minutes stirring frequently.
Experiment with the order of when you add certain ingredients. Some like to add garlic and onions last and others like to add it to the pan first.
If you are sauteing meat, consider sauteing the meat separately to avoid under-cooking the meat. Once you feel comfortable you can saute everything in the same pan.

, Caramelizing is a useful technique that can be used to many ingredients. Caramelizing is all about slow cooking in a pan to bring out the natural sweetness out of an ingredient. Take caramelizing onions for example:


Use thick slices to avoid burning the onion and cook with an even ratio of butter and oil. Cover the surface of the pan, but don’t cram too many onions onto the pan. Keep the heat on medium-low throughout the cooking to ensure a successful caramelization without burning anything. This will take close to 45 minutes if done properly.You can do this same technique with a variety of produce like garlic or even broccoli.

, Sweating your veggies is very similar to sauteing, but the temperature you use to sweat is lower. You want bring out flavors while tenderizing the veggies, instead of browning them. Heat your pan on medium-low heat and wait about 10 minutes for the pan to heat. Add the oil of your choice (2 tbs), distribute the oil in your pan, and then add your chopped veggies.


Throw in a healthy amount of salt and let your veggies sizzle gently, opposed to a loud sizzle. Adjust the temperature if it sounds too loud.
Stir the produce frequently to avoid browning. Cook in the pan for about five to ten minutes. You are looking for your produce to soften or become translucent., Another technique for vegetables is blanching. Heat a large cooking pot of water on high heat with a generous amount of salt. Prepare a bowl of ice water and set to the side. Chop your vegetables and once the water is boiling, add them to the pot. Let the veggies cook for 1 ½ to 2 minutes tops. Strain the vegetables in a colander and immediately dump them into the ice bath.The result is perfectly tender vegetables that can easily be thrown into a dish.
If you plan to cook the veggies in a different pot, heat them in boiling water for a minute.
After thirty seconds in the ice bath, your vegetables are ready.

, A vital part of cooking is tasting the flavor as you cook. If the dish tastes bitter or bland, add salt to the dish. Try out a pinch or teaspoon at a time until the flavor improves. If you think the dish still needs more flavor try adding acidity or spice to the dish.


Add spice by using chopped, fresh peppers (jalapeno or habanero), 1 tsp of cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes.
Add acidity near the end of cooking by squeezing a fresh lemon over the dish, or by adding 2 tablespoons of vinegar (rice wine, balsamic, or malt).
Another way to boost the flavor of a dish is by adding a splash of wine. Let the dish cook for 5 to 10 minutes in order to cook off the alcohol., Experimenting in the kitchen won’t always produce an incredible meal. All cooks who’ve took this leap have failed at some point through experimentation. The point is to attempt to move forward into uncharted cooking territories.

Organize your space.,
Purchase decent equipment.,
Plan out your week.,
Shop smart.",How to Be a Good Cook3," The best way to prepare for a recipe is by having a clean and organized work space. Begin by cleaning the surface tops of your kitchen and ensure that there aren’t any dirty dishes in the sink. Keep your cabinets clean and organized by going through them to check for expired products.


Additionally, you want your refrigerator to be clean and avoid keeping expired or too much leftover food.

, The first advice you’ll hear from cooks on how to become better cooks is to have good knives. Invest in the nicest knives you can afford. It might sound unimportant, but quality knives will expedite your chopping process and make cooking more enjoyable.A good way to check if your knife is sharp enough is if you cry while cutting onions. A knife that is sharp enough won’t cause you to cry.

, The best way to save money and shop efficiently is by planning out a meal for each night of the week. Once you figure out your meal for everyday of the week, you can start to look at each day’s recipe and ingredient list. Compile a grocery list based off your plan. Take this model as inspiration for you as you plan out your week:Monday is pasta night.
Tuesday is taco night.
Wednesday is Asian stir-fry.
Thursday is meat and potato night.
Friday is burger night.
Saturday is your night to go out.
Sunday is leftover night.

, The best way to shop for multiple recipes is to choose recipes that require similar ingredients. This way you can buy bulk amounts of similar ingredients to cover a lot of grounds. You should also consider the amount of processed food you buy and feed your family. Attempt to stay away from lengthy ingredient lists and especially from GMO (genetically modified products) and high fructose corn syrup.


Shop organic when you have the means to. There are ways of shopping for healthy ingredients on a budget.

Lessen the amount of sugar.,
Use a sugar substitute.,
Substitute maple syrup.,
Add honey instead.,
Use agave nectar in place of sugar.,
Incorporate applesauce in baked goods.",How to Balance Sweetness1," If you’re sensitive to sweetness, the amount that a recipe calls for may just be too much for you. In that case, feel free to tinker with the recipe and decrease the sugar that’s called for, so the sweetness is more balanced for your palate. For example, if the recipe suggests ¼ cup of sugar, try ⅛ cup instead.If you’re not sure how to much to decrease the sugar by, start by adding a very small amount, such as a teaspoon, and then taste the dish. Add another teaspoon if it’s not sweet enough. It’s easy to add more sugar, but it’s harder to balance the sweetness once it’s already in the dish.
If you're baking, it's obviously harder to taste cookies and cake as you go to adjust the sweetness. Sugar also affects the texture and moistness of baked goods, so you have to be careful when you adjust the amount in a recipe. Using 3/4 of the suggested sugar usually yields the best results, but you may want to make a batch of test cookies or cake to ensure that you're happy with the results.;
, Artificial sweeteners are usually sweeter than traditional white or brown, which means you don’t have to use as much of them in your recipes. That can help you have better control over the sweetness of your food. Sucralose, commonly sold as Splenda, and stevia, commonly sold as Truvia, are ideal for cooking and baking because it’s heat stable.


Sucralose can be substituted for sugar in a 1:1 ratio, which means if your recipe calls for a 1/4 of sugar, you can replace it with a 1/4 of sucralose.
Stevia is 200 times sweeter than sugar. Replace each cup of sugar with 1 teaspoon of stevia in your dishes. If the recipe calls for a tablespoon of sugar, an 1/8 of a teaspoon of stevia is all you need. A pinch of stevia can replace a teaspoon of sugar.
Some sugar substitutes, such as Equal and Sweet’N Low, don’t react the same way as sugar does when they’re heated. It’s best to avoid them when cooking and baking.

, It contains natural sugars that can add a subtle sweetness to your dish, as well as antioxidants that are actually good for you. You can replace one cup of white sugar with 3/4 of a cup maple syrup.For the best results, be sure to choose 100% pure, organic maple syrup. Grade A has a more subtle flavor, while Grade B has a stronger flavor and thicker texture so it works well in baking.
If you're using maple syrup to replace sugar in baked goods, you'll need to adjust the overall amount of liquid in the recipe by approximately three tablespoons for every cup of maple syrup that you add.

, Like maple syrup, honey can add a mellow, more wholesome sweetness to your recipes in place of sugar. However, it's sweeter than white sugar, so you don't need to add as much. For every one cup of sugar in a recipe, replace with 3/4 of a cup of honey.In baking recipes, you'll need to reduce the overall liquid by approximately two tablespoons for every one cup of honey used.
Baked goods made with honey tend to brown faster than those made with white sugar, so watch cookies, cakes, and other sweets carefully.

, Agave syrup has a lighter taste than maple syrup or honey, and its texture is thinner than honey but thicker than maple syrup. However, like the honey and maple syrup, it's all-natural, so it's good alternative to white sugar. Replace every cup of sugar in your recipe with 2/3 of a cup of agave nectar.Because of its liquid consistency, you'll need to reduce the overall liquid in your recipe by 1/4 to 1/3 of a cup for every cup of agave used.
Baked goods made with agave nectar have a tendency to brown more quickly, so you may want to reduce the baking temperature by 15 to 25 degrees.

, Make your cookies, cakes, and other goodies a little less sweet by using the natural sugars in applesauce in place of white sugar. It's one of the easier replacements to make, too, because you can replace it cup for cup. That means if your recipe calls for two cups of sugar, you can substitute two cups of applesauce in its place.Make sure to choose unsweetened applesauce when you're replacing sugar. Otherwise, your recipe may actually wind up too sweet.
When you're baking with applesauce, you'll need to reduce the overall amount of liquid in the recipe by 1/4 of a cup for every cup of sauce used.

Add more of the main ingredient(s).,
Mix in water or stock.,
Blend in milk or cream.",How to Balance Sweetness2," If you’ve added too much sugar, you can balance out the sweetness by incorporating more of another ingredient to help make the dish less sweet. The easiest way to dilute a recipe is to add more of the main ingredient, so the taste of the sugar isn’t as obvious.If your tomato sauce is too sweet, try adding more tomatoes or tomato paste to counter the sugar.
For a salad dressing that’s too sweet, mix in additional olive oil.
If your chili is too sweet, you can add in some extra meat or beans to help balance the sweetness.

, In some cases, incorporating a little extra liquid in a recipe can help balance out excessive sweetness. Water is an ideal choice because it is flavorless, so it will dilute the sugar without changing the taste of your dish. Chicken, beef, or vegetable stock is also an option if you don’t mind adding extra flavor to the dish.Diluting a recipe with a liquid to balance the sweetness typically works best with dishes that already have a creamy or liquid-like consistency, such as soups and stews.
If you plan to dilute with water or chicken stock, start with a small amount, so you can see how it affects the dish. You don’t only have to think about the taste, though -- consider the consistency too.

, If you’re worried that water or stock will make your dish too thin or runny, dairy products such as milk, cream or half and half are an ideal alternative. They tend to have a thicker consistency, so they’ll keep your recipe creamy while balancing the sweetness.Milk and cream can work well in soups, sauces, and casseroles.
If you’re vegan or don’t eat dairy, non-dairy milks, such as almond, cashew, or soy, are a good alternative. Just make sure to choose an unflavored, unsweetened variety.

Add vinegar to baking soda.,
Add lemon to activate baking soda.,
Add other juices to baking soda.",How to Activate Baking Soda1," Vinegar is an acid, and baking soda is a base. Thus, if you mix them together, you will get an acid-base reaction. Vinegar is probably the most common way to activate baking soda..


The reaction can turn the baking soda into a powerful cleaning agent. For example, vinegar and baking soda can be used to clean a kitchen sink.Add ¼ cup of warm tap water and 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of vinegar into ¼ cup of baking soda to see if the baking soda is still good. If it bubbles, it is. This is called “proofing” the baking soda.Vinegar will create a powerful fizz when added to baking soda because of the degree of acidity in it. It's the acetic acid in the vinegar that causes the chemical reaction.;
, Lemon or lemon juice will create an alkalizing effect when mixed with baking soda, activating it.


Add a teaspoon of baking soda to a glass of mineral or other water, and add in the juice from half a lemon. Mix thoroughly before drinking. Some recipes call for adding peppermint leaves or a pinch of salt into the lemon and baking soda mixture, in addition to water.This mixture has purported health benefits. Some people believe it can be used to combat acidosis. The mixture helps the body remove toxins and burn fat. It can be helpful for kidney care.Drinking lemon juice and baking soda can also improve your digestion and combat acid reflux. It helps to purify your liver and provides some needed nutrients, like vitamin C. Always check with your doctor, though, before using any natural remedies.

, Although lemon juice is one of the most common acids to add to baking soda, other juices can work too.


Try adding orange juice to baking soda, and you will get bubbles that come from the release of the carbon dioxide. Fruit purees also activate baking soda. Orange juice has more acid in it than most other fruit juices.
Other juices that will react to baking soda include grape juice, vegetable and fruit juice blends, and limeade.Ketchup can react with baking soda because it contains vinegar.
The acidic reaction will cause fizzing that indicates the baking soda is fresh and actively working.

Stir in citrus juice.,
Add vinegar.,
Mix in wine.",How to Balance Sweetness3," Citrus fruits have a fresh, tart taste that can balance out the sweetness in a recipe. If your dish is too sweet, squeeze in a little fresh juice to counter the excess sugar. It’s best to start with just a small amount, such as a teaspoon, so you don’t run the risk of making the food too tart instead of too sweet.Lemon or lime juice works best when you want to balance a savory recipe that’s overly sweet.
It’s a good idea to squeeze your citrus fruit into a cup or bowl instead of directly into the pot or pan. That way, you won’t accidentally let any seeds or pulp fall into your food.
If citrus juice is too liquidy to add to your dish, lemon or lime zest can also add some tartness.

, Like citrus fruits, vinegar is an acidic ingredient that can add tartness to a dish to help balance the sweetness. However, unlike fruits which can go bad quickly, you can keep a bottle of vinegar in your pantry for years, so you’ll always have it on hand if you add too much sugar to a dish. Start with just a splash or teaspoon and taste, so you can ensure that the recipe is balanced. You can always add more if necessary.Virtually any vinegar can help correct food that’s too sweet, but white, red wine, white wine, and apple cider usually work the best.

, Adding a splash or teaspoon of wine to your recipe to balance the sweetness is similar to stirring in some vinegar because both are acidic and alcohol-based. However, wine has a higher alcohol content, so if you don’t want alcohol in your dish, bring the food to a boil to evaporate the alcohol.You can use cooking wine to help counter excess sweetness, but any wine that you would drink will work just as well.

Sprinkle in some pepper.,
Incorporate garlic.,
Stir in oregano, ginger, basil, cumin, or your favorite pungent spice/herb.",How to Balance Sweetness4," Giving your dish a spicy kick can help tone down its sweetness, and pepper works really well to add some heat. Depending on the food and your personal tastes, you can use black, cayenne, or crushed red pepper to help balance the flavors in your recipe. A pinch is usually all it takes, but taste the dish to see if the sweetness has been adequately toned down., There’s a reason that so many recipes call for garlic -- it has a spicy distinctive taste that can help lessen the sweetness in a dish. Best of all, it’s versatile, so you can add it to sauces, meat, fish, vegetables, soups, stews, and casseroles that are too sweet.Fresh garlic cloves have the strongest flavor, so they usually work best. However, garlic powder can be effective too. Start with 1 clove of garlic or ⅛ of teaspoon of the powder, and adjust to taste.
Don’t cook the dish too long after you’ve added the garlic. It becomes sweeter the longer that you cook it, so you can actually wind up increasing the sweetness in your food.

, Any spice that adds heat or a smoky, earthy flavor is ideal for countering excess sweetness, so choose an option that complements the dish that you’re making. Both fresh and dried spices can work, but start with a small amount and taste as you go.Dried herbs and spices are stronger and more concentrated than their fresh counterparts, so you don’t need to use as much. Start with ⅛ of a teaspoon and add more if necessary after tasting.
Other spices and herbs that you may want to consider for balancing sweetness include rosemary, sage, thyme, chili powder, and marjoram.

Put the baking soda into batter.,
Add molasses to baking soda.,
Add water to the baking soda.",How to Activate Baking Soda2," Baking soda is an essential leavening agent for recipes that call for an acid, such as buttermilk, vinegar, sour cream, yogurt, lemon or orange juice, cocoa, chocolate, honey, maple syrup, fruit, or brown sugar.


When baking soda interacts with acidic substances such as those above it creates sodium carbonate and carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide bubbles give rise to baked goods. Follow the amount of baking soda specified on the recipe. Make sure that you do not substitute baking soda for baking powder as they are different!
Sour cream, yogurt, and molasses also create a bubbling reaction in baked goods. Add one teaspoon of baking soda or follow the recipe’s directions.The addition of the baking soda will cause an instant reaction if one of these acidic ingredients is present, so that the batter will expand when the batter is put into the oven. This in turn will cause the batter to rise, creating a lighter texture to baked goods like cookies, quick breads, cakes, and muffins., In addition to reacting in batter, some people have claimed that a mixture of molasses and baking soda can help cure cancer. However, check with your doctor.Mix one cup of water with 1 teaspoon of black strap molasses and 1 teaspoon of baking soda. The water should be room temperature.You can also use grade B maple syrup, or Manuka honey in place of the black strap molasses.Always research alternative health treatments. Do not assume that the solution actually works because of one man’s experience., Baking soda will dissolve in water. However, there are many uses for baking soda water.


The baking soda water can help with chronic heartburn or acid reflux by neutralizing stomach acids.All you need is a tablespoon of baking soda in a glass of water.
Baking soda water can also be used as a mild antiseptic. Remember that baking soda is high in sodium and can have side effects, such as stomach cramping.
Check with your doctor if you have high blood pressure, are a nursing mother or are pregnant."

Use baking soda as a toiletry.,
Clean a sink or faucets with vinegar and baking soda.,
Use vinegar and baking soda to clean a plugged drain.,
Make a bottle rocket.",How to Activate Baking Soda3," Baking soda can be used to alleviate the pain of insect bites and poison ivy.


Create a paste out of baking soda and water, and rub it on the bites. Baking soda will relieve minor skin irritation and itching.Baking soda also neutralizes sunburn. Add ½ cup of baking soda to slightly warm bathwater.
You can also use baking soda to neutralize stomach acid, thus relieving ailments like indigestion, heartburn and ulcer pain. Only use it as an occasional treatment, and check with a doctor first.
Dissolve ½ teaspoon in half a glass of water, and take it every two hours. Do not take more than three ½ teaspoons of the mixture if you’re over 50 or more than seven ½ teaspoons in 24 hours.

, Baking powder has cleansing properties for your skin, not just your appliances!


You can create a relaxing bath to soak in using baking soda and apple cider.
Soak your feet in baking soda and exfoliate them by adding three tablespoons of baking soda to a tub of warm water.
Cleanse your hands by mixing three parts of baking soda with one part of water. This creates a natural hand cleanser to rub away dirt.

, Baking soda can be used in place of toothpaste to clean and deodorize your teeth.


Mix 1 teaspoon of baking soda with a few drops of hydrogen peroxide to form a natural toothpaste. The hydrogen peroxide will activate the baking soda.
Some toothpastes contain baking soda. Some studies have found those toothpastes are more successful at removing plaque because the baking soda has a mild abrasiveness. Mix six parts of baking soda to one part of sea salt and turn this into a tooth and gum paste by mixing in a blender for 30 seconds.
Baking soda can also help whiten your teeth. Crush one strawberry together with ½ teaspoon of baking soda. Put the paste on your teeth, and leave for five minutes. Only do this once a week so you don’t damage your teeth enamel., Baking soda can be used as a natural deodorant, and combining it with shampoo can add shine to your hair.


Combine 4 tablespoons (59.1 ml) of baking soda with 10 drops of essential oil to form a natural deodorant. Mix 4 tablespoons of baking soda with 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of olive oil to create an exfoliating scrub.
The baking soda will react with acidic sweat or skin oils chemically and neutralize odors.
You can also put baking soda in your shampoo to increase shine.A quarter-size amount is all you need in a single shampoo.

, Once combined with baking soda, vinegar becomes a powerful cleaning agent.


Wet the sink. Place baking soda around the sink and then scrub it. Now, line the sink with vinegar-soaked paper towels. Let them sit for 20 minutes.You can also clean kitchen faucets (or silverware) by using the same process.
To make a homemade cleaner for a bathroom, add 1 2/3 cups of baking soda, ½ cup liquid soap, ½ cup water, and 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) white vinegar.

, A mixture of baking soda and vinegar can also be used to clean drains.


Pour a pot of boiling hot water down the drain, and then pour in ½ cup baking soda. Let it sit.
Now, pour 1 cup vinegar and 1 cup very hot water down the drain. Cover it with a drain plug. Let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes. The vinegar’s chemical reaction should dislodge the grime in the plugged drain loose. Finally, put another pot of hot water down the drain.To make a soda-vinegar cleaning solution for hard water, combine 1 cup of vinegar with 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of baking soda. Mix them together in a pot. When the mixture stops foaming, pour it into a bottle., Only do this with great care! To make a bottle rocket, you can use vinegar and baking soda.


Take a piece of paper, and put baking soda on it. Wrap it up tight, and roll the ends tight. Pour vinegar into an empty plastic bottle. Put the baking soda paper roll inside the bottle. Now cork the bottle, shake it and put it on the ground.
The chemical reaction between the baking soda and vinegar should send the bottle soaring off the ground. The reaction releases gas and turns the baking soda into water and carbon dioxide.Make a baking soda volcano by pouring vinegar into baking soda you embed in a snow volcano outside. See how long it takes to overflow."

To begin with this will take you about 1 hour per lesson.,
SAUCES, the first lesson.,
SPICES, the second lesson.,
TEMPERATURE is the last training for now.,
Yes, this is how to become a gourmet cook.",How to Be a Gourmet Cook in 3 Easy Lessons," You will do them in batches on different days. You will need to prepare base dishes for experimentation. Make them big batches because you will want to use small portions as a base for difference testing and don’t want to have to recook new batches. If you normally cook for a family, don’t do this for them. If you cook for one or two others, ok.


Pick one or two of the following bases and make them ahead so you can have it ready when you begin testing. I won’t give you a recipe, but you’ll be fine. Each is basic with NO seasoning, added ingredients, or complicated steps. You will need about ½ cup of base for each person per each test you will prepare. Each test will total about 3 to 4 portions so 4 servings x 3 lessons = 12 ½ cup portions = 6 cups per person. AND they don’t have to eat every bite. Remember this is experimentation.
ROASTED POTATOES - Actually you’ll use the microwave, not the oven. It works for testing just as well. Cut the potatoes into 1"" cubes. Spread on a platter and put in the microwave on high until done (probably about 10 minutes). The surfaces will be dried, the center done. Put them into a big baggie or covered serving dish in the refrigerator to use later.
STEAMED RICE - Do check a recipe, but the easiest way is to mix the water and rice together in the recipe proportions and then begin to boil. When it boils, stir it a couple of times. Turn the heat down to it’s lowest for about 20 minutes and stir occasionally. It will fluff up then get stuck together. No Worries. When it’s done, do the same as the Potatoes. Working with it cold will fluff it up nicely later.
PASTA - Use macaroni, bow ties, or some chunky type of pasta. Follow the instructions on the bag. End with the same as the potatoes in the refrigerator.Now if you were efficient, you could have done all these with about 20 minutes of preparation time, about 20 minutes of stove time, and a final 10 minutes of storage time - not bad for less than 1 hour. All the above will keep in a refrigerator for a week, be fine and still taste good. Do the experimentation on a different day than the above so it’s easier and faster.;
, We are going to make two very basic sauces with 2 variations each. You will need 4 small to medium pans, but you can use a big skillet if you need to. Here’s your basic ingredients.


Sauce 1 - 1 can chicken broth, 2 Tbs butter, 2 Tbs flour, extra water (1 can if necessary) Melt the butter in a medium pan over medium heat. Add the flour and stir strongly until the flour begins to lightly brown (about 1 to 2 minutes). Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Stir constantly. Boil for two minutes then turn off the heat. If the mixture is VERY thick and gummy add a little water while stirring until it gets to a maple syrup like consistency.
Sauce 2 - 1 can chicken broth, 1 Tbs corn starch, extra water (1 can if necessary) Bring the chicken broth to a boil. Mix the corn starch with 1 Tbs of water. It’ll start thick then thin down. Pour the white mixture into the boiling broth and begin stirring constantly. Boil for at least 1 minute then turn off heat. Do the same for consistency as above if it’s too thick. If you cook cornstarch more than4 or 5 minutes it might begin to break down into thin again.
For your variations you will use salt & pepper, any medium or hard cheese you like, mustard (dry or wet).
Pour half of each pan into another pan. You will return each pan to medium heat for the next step.Pan 1 - no variation
Pan 2 - Taste it and add salt and pepper to it (not much at a time), tasting over again, until you like it.
Pan 3 - Add mustard on the same basis as the salt (about 1/8 tsp per test) - to taste.
Pan 4 - Add 1/4 cup grated cheese and stir until it’s melted.
WAIT - there are two sauces and four variations. Yes, but there are only two things you are learning. Sauce consistency and palatability. Set out a plate with 1/4 cup to ½ cup of any of the bases heated for about 1 minute on high in a microwave and spoon some of the sauce over each basic. What you are wanting to learn is the difference between a glaze (corn starch) and flour based sauce. They will look different and feel different on the tongue. Now, test the taste of each test to see what the most basic variations in cooking do to the sauce. Notice that the base is the same, but oh, what a difference a sauce makes.

, Every recipe has seasoning, herbs and spices, listed and proportioned. The problem is that it’s what the originator liked. I have a fantastic recipe I developed for Pumpkin Pie made from a pumpkin, not a can. I had to test over 20 different variations until I found the exact recipe I loved. Others love it, too, but maybe you wouldn’t. So why would you want to eat my recipe if you don’t like ginger? They are guides to be used by a gourmet to build on.There are hundreds of spices and I’m not here to teach them all to you. What you should learn is concept and experience on how to learn what you want and go for it. Get on the Internet and you’ll find hundreds of sites on spices. What you really want to look for are appearance, what kind of foods it’s normally used in, what other spices it works with, and a non-allegorical, clear and sensible description of what it taste like along with some example to help you identify it. For example - Anise is a seed that when ground into a dark powder gives an earthy, somewhat bitter taste usually associated with licorice. It’s used in candies, salads, with fish and in stews.Eventually, what you want is to test different common seasonings to find which ones and in what ratios you personally like for what kind of dishes. Once you have little cheat sheets, they will be almost all you need to make fabulous tasting dishes from almost anything. Test uncommon ones like saffron to find it’s distinctiveness for special tastes, but you will end up with a nice spice shelf with from 8 to 20 spices you use commonly. Most spices are found dry in bottles, but make sure you test fresh ones, especially those you can easily buy for when you want that extra little special flavor. Remember to broaden you perspective. We’re talking about dinner dishes here. What about cookies, ice creams, beverages, etc? Do you like cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg together? In what ratios do you like them best?


Now to test. Buy two bottles of any off the shelf spaghetti sauce you like. Try to find the basic one without all the added meats, cheeses, garden ingredients, and extra seasonings. Remember, you are testing to see what YOU can make different.Like before, start with two pans, one full bottle in each. Your variations are going to be based on these ingredients: salt, pepper, sugar, bottle of mixed Italian seasonings, FRESH Basil, FRESH marjoram, FRESH oregano, FRESH thyme or at least 3 of them.
Bring 1/2 bottle in each of four pans to a simmer over medium heat, Don’t burn the bottom or boil hard. You will add salt, pepper and sugar to the last three, but only to add a little flavor as you like it.
Pan 1 - no variation
Pan 2 - salt, pepper, sugar only
Pan 3 - dried mixed Italian seasonings, salt, pepper, sugar
Pan 4 - FRESH herbs, salt, pepper, sugar. For the fresh herbs what you want are the leaves, not the stems. Rub and pull off the leaves. Use a sharp knife on a plate or saucer to bunch and chop or cut each herb into 1/4"" small pieces. Keep them separate.
For Pans 3 and 4 it will take a few minutes each time you add a seasoning to bring out the taste so add, mix, then taste about 3 minutes later. The reason for simmering is to prevent the seasoning from overcooking.As you test for each one you’ll find you use about 3 to 4 times as much FRESH as dry herbs.
Start with Pan 2 salt, pepper, and sugar to get a balance you like. Only do a pinch of each at a time. Most cooks don’t realize the secret ingredient in all tomato pasta sauces is sugar. Not a lot, but enough to subdue the harsh and sometimes acid taste inherent in the sauce. Once learned some cooks use more and more sugar. Once you have Pan 2 to your liking do Pans 3 and 4 with about the same ratio of salt, pepper and sugar, but only 2/3rds as much. You can add more in later if you wish.
IN pan 3 begin with about 1 tsp of dry mix total and about 1 tsp of each of the FRESH herbs (4 tsp total). Mix well, simmer for 3 minutes and taste. Continue this process until you get close to what you like. Try to pick out a taste element you seem to not appreciate too much. You’ll be surprised at what a little sugar can clean up. If you need more spices, add them in the small quantities ½ as much as initially. This may take you 10 to 15 minutes and since you’re doing all together your preparation time should be no more than 30 minutes.
When ready, again set out plates with 4 base scoops ready for testing. Heat them in a microwave for 1 minute on high. Pour some sauce from each pan onto a base sample and taste the difference. If you’re used to adding a hard cheese, have it on the side ready, but only AFTER you feel you’ve learned what you want in this process.What you are learning is how to take a basic sauce we all use, decide if you can use dry or fresh herbs, what differences it makes, what subtleties show up, how do fresh herbs feel in the mouth, does it change the consistency of the sauce, what does sugar do to the concoction, and finally how the variations make the base taste so different.

, There are all kinds of tests, variations in chemical process, alterations in ingredients, and steps involved that create masterpieces. However, temperature is inherent in almost all of them. Instead of making a dry or moist cake we are going to cook something a little more robust and common - your choice of roast. It can be any kind, size, shape, meat, fat, lean, etc. you want. My suggestion will be 2 medium size beef round or rolled roasts (ones that looks like a ball when ready). The lesson here is successive steps and temperature. We won’t cover it here, but one of the biggest failings most cooks have is following a recipe and trying to cook all the ingredients in a nice ordered succession. It’s often much more successful to separate the steps and even do them out of sequence then add it all together for a final dish.


To prepare both roasts they will all undergo the same process before cooking. Cut each roast into ½ on the roll so each half is surrounded by the same exterior and end up being one end or the other. They should be about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) thick minimum. All will be wrapped in plastic or in a large zip lock bag for 24 to 48 hours. This helps tenderize the meat. In two of those bags place 2 cups water mixed with 4 tbs salt into the bag and squeeze out all the air. These are being brined which is another major step almost all chefs use to tenderize and moisten meats prior to cooking.When ready to cook cooking temperature will be the only real difference.
Mix 1 tbs salt and ½ tbs pepper in a bowl and grind together with the back of a spoon. If you have a mortar and pestle, use it to achieve a fine powder. You may double this is you need more. Pat dry the 4 roasts with paper towels. Use the ground powder to rub all surfaces of each roast. You don’t need really thick, just a nice coating on each piece. Place some wadded up aluminum foil in the bottom of 4 pie plates with a roast on each so that it won’t be sitting in it’s own juices.
Roast 1 (Un brined) - high heat 1 tbs oil into a skillet. Just as it begins to smoke place Roast 1 any side down until it begins to brown. Turn onto each side to brown each side.
Roast 3 (Brined) - high heat 1 tbs oil into a skillet. Just as it begins to smoke place Roast 3 any side down until it begins to brown. Turn onto each side to brown each side.
Roast 2 (Un brined) - DO THE ABOVE STEP AT THE VERY END OF COOKING, NOT NOW.
Roast 4 (Brined) - DO THE ABOVE STEP AT THE VERY END OF COOKING, NOT NOW.
Temperature in meats is critical. Everyone thinks of the final internal temperature to prevent bacteria, but that’s nothing to do with taste. As meats begin to warm they pass through a range. Each range does different things. High heat (400F to 600F) sears the outside into a tough shell and restricts heat from entering and moisture from escaping. Sounds good? Not really. Low Heat (200F to 300F) takes a very long time to reach internal temperature but all the outer portion stays cooler in the process. During the cooler processing the collagen fibers and fats in the muscle meat begin to cook, change and tenderize. The longer this can be maintained the tenderer the meat will be.Roast 2 and 4 will go into the oven early ASAP at 300F for about 1 to 2 hours. Timing is always off so you’ll have to use a meat thermometer. Try to use one of those instant read ones in you can. After two hours, and each15 to 20 minutes later stick the thermometer into the center of the roast, away from any bone and test the temperature. When it reaches 180F you’re ready for the next step. Take it out.
Turn the oven up to 450F and put Roast 1 and 3 in. Cook on higher heat for 20 minutes before you begin using the thermometer. Shoot for the same 180F. While this is baking, do the pan searing on the outside of Roasts 2 and 4, just like on 1 and 3. All should become ready about the same time. Remove from heat when done and let stand for 5 minutes minimum. This allow the juices that have been expanding to the outside to reenter the center of the roast for moisture.
While resting the meat, gather all your juices together into one pan. Don’t try to keep them separate. Bring to a simmer and begin tasting to see what ingredients you want to add to enhance the flavor to your liking. If, previously you liked the flour and butter sauce, do it in a separate pan or skillet and use the pan drippings as the broth. If you like the corn starch simple use it to derive the consistency you want. Again test taste at the end to fix anything with a little nudge.
Serve the plate with the 1 minute microwave heated bases plus thinly sliced portions of all 4 roasts. Serve the gravy on the side so each meat can be judged without the gravy first. What you are looking for is color, tenderness, juiciness, dryness, taste, texture, etc. What you will find is the slow cooked ones are more tender and juicier and usually have more pink in the center than the normally cooked ones. The initial unbrined, then seared then baked will probably be least appreciated.

, You’re not one yet. It takes time patience, specific testing, and the realization that it’s your mouth, treat it the way you want. You’ve learned how to make a few sauces, but more importantly you’ve learned how sauces can add tremendously to the taste of any dish. There are hundreds of sauces, but there are generally about 6 cooking sauces and about 6 dessert sauces. It’s not that hard to test more. You’ve learned how to use no, dry and FRESH spices that make a difference.


Try other concoction, cookies, vegetables, fish, desserts, drinks, sandwiches, etc. Did you ever try butter, peanut butter, and maple syrup on pancakes or waffles? Be adventurous sometime. You might like it.Being a gourmet cook is all about knowing what you like AND how to use various extra combinations to improve on the basic taste of any recipe to make it more of what you want. As you learn and improve it gets easier and more people will like it, too.

You must use the basic tenets of the color wheel to mix these colors into many different shades across the color spectrum.
Concentrated pastes are available in baking stores and craft stores. They create beautiful, rich colors; however, some people believe they produce a metallic or bitter taste, and so they can offset the taste of the food. They can be expensive, depending upon your local shopping outlet.
Many professional bakers use soft gel pastes. They are widely available from baking outlets and online sources. These are tasteless and come in dozens of shades, so you don't have to mix them yourself. However, they can be expensive. You may need to prepare food in bulk to get good value out of them. Make sure to buy the .75 oz. (22ml) bottles rather than the 4.5 oz. (133ml) bottles.
Research organic food coloring. If you are doing vegan baking, then most liquid and paste food coloring will be off-limits. This is because food colorings are sometimes made from insect shells and chemicals.;
, Print off a color wheel from the internet. Visiting sites that give a refresher course on color theory will help you to produce secondary and tertiary colors.


Go to colormatters.com/color-and-design/basic-color-theory for some good images and information on the color wheel.

, You may feel as if you have to mix the colors before you add them to the food; however, this is not necessary. They will mix in if you add a drop of 1 color and drops of another color.


Each food will respond to coloring differently. Always add the coloring 1 drop at a time.

, If you are making baked goods, then chances are you can receive mechanical help to mix colors thoroughly.

, Very few foods are perfectly white. If you want to have this effect, then buy white gel or paste separately.

, This magazine and website has detailed research on how to create the most rich and unusual colors on the color wheel. Learn to make shades like pink lemonade, dinner mint and pinot noir.


Visit Food Network's color chart to access the online version. If you want the magazine copy, you can request the May 2012 issue.

, These shades are harder to form and may take up to 1 oz. of food coloring.

, If you are baking or cooking the food, this may not apply. You will be able to tell if the color will fade or remain vibrant.

, Omit the cream of tartar, vinegar or lemon juice. Using brown food coloring with this type of acidic food may result in a greenish hue.


Acidic foods can also cause violet to look blue. Adjust accordingly.

, A number of fruits, vegetables and spices can be added to food to change the color. Make sure to use these colorings carefully, because they may change the flavor.


Add beetroot juice to your food to give it a ruby-red color. In some foods, some of the red can bake out, but the naturally sweet juice will give a very slight sweetened boost to baked goods. Use beet juice from the can or juice your own beets.
Juice carrots to add an orange color. These vegetables are also pleasantly sweet and good in both sweet and salty foods.
Use saffron or turmeric very sparingly for a yellow color. These spices are strong, so research a recipe to take the potent flavor out of them before using them in sweet foods.
For a green color, use liquid chlorophyll or spinach. A few cups of spinach gives a mild flavor but a rich color to light foods. It mixes well with fruits without adding a vegetable flavor.
Boil red cabbage to create purple dye. Add the purple water to your recipe. Add some baking soda - a little at a time to the purple water to make a blue dye.

For a softer muffin, you can bake them at 400 degrees.
The lower the temperature, the longer the muffins will need to bake.

, This will prevent your muffins from sticking while they bake. Spray the tin generously.
Don't spray it too much. If you do the spray will pool at the bottom of each muffin.
You can also use a non-stick muffin tin.

, You need to fill them 2/3 of the way. If you over-fill a muffin cup, the batter will overflow during baking. The edges of the muffin will easily burn.
Under-filling a tin will result in a smaller, dry muffin.
As you fill the muffin tins, stir the batter to keep it well mixed.

, You can add as many or as few as you like. Add at least 3 blueberries or chocolate chips to the center of each muffin.
There is no need to press them down into the muffin. They will bake into the muffin as it rises.
You can also experiment with other fillings like dried cranberries or other fruit.

, You will now bake them until golden. These will bake 8-9 minutes in a 425 degree oven.
If you prefer a softer muffin, you can bake them for about 11 minutes in a 400 degree oven.
When done, allow to cool slightly before serving.

Make sure to sift flour for recipes with delicate textures.,
Sift flour over a work surface before you roll or knead dough.",How to Sift Flour Without a Sifter," If you don't have a sifter handy, you can use a strainer to sift your flour. Find a strainer large enough to hold the amount of flour you need to sift. Find a bowl slightly larger than the strainer, as you'll be holding the strainer over the bowl., Take the strainer with one hand as you pour. Make sure to position the strainer just over the bowl you're using to collect the flour.Flour is a powdery substance, so it can be a bit messy. Make sure to pour slowly. If you pour too fast, the flour may get on your shirt and your work surface.
It's a good idea to wear an old shirt or an apron when sifting flour.

, Be gentle as you tap. You should tap with one hand, and hold the strainer with the other. Your tapping should cause flour to lightly sprinkle out of the strainer and into the bowl. The flour should be thinner and lump free as it falls into the bowl.If the flour still has lumps in it when it falls in the bowl, you're tapping too hard. Put the flour back in the strainer and start over.
It may take awhile to get all the flour through the strainer, so have patience. Do not tap the strainer hard to speed up the process. If the flour goes through the strainer too fast, it may not be sifted thoroughly enough.

, If you don't have a strainer or sifter, you can use a wire whisk to sift the flour. In addition to a wire whisk, get a bowl large enough to contain as much flour as you need.If you don't have a wire whisk, you can use a fork in a pinch. Go for a bigger fork, as this will allow you to sift the flour more efficiently.

, Place the correct amount of flour in your bowl. Take your wire whisk or fork and place it in the flour. Swirl the whisk or fork in quick, circular motions. You should start to see the flour even out and lose some lumps and hard spots.If the flour is not evening out or losing lumps, you may need to use faster motions.

, It can take awhile to sift flour using this method, especially if you're sifting a large amount of flour. Try not to get frustrated. Keep working at the flour, swirling your whisk or fork in quick circular motions, until the flour is light and even throughout.When you're finished, your flour should be lump free. You should be left with a light, even, and powdery substance.
If your wrist gets sore, it's okay to take a break from sifting for a moment.

, Pay attention to the wording in the recipe when sifting your flour. The wording in a recipe affects how the flour is sifted. There is a difference between ""1 cup flour, sifted"" and ""1 cup sifted flour.""If the recipe calls for ""1 cup flour, sifted,"" measure the flour first. Then, transfer it to a bowl and sift.
If the recipe calls for ""1 cup sifted flour,"" sift a good portion of flour. Then, measure out however much you need for the recipe.

, You do not always need to sift flour. If flour has not been sitting in a bag too long, it may be light enough to simply use in a recipe. When flour is in a bag for awhile, however, it gets compact and needs to be sifted.If your bag of flour was squeezed into a cabinet, or had another item sitting on top of it, it's especially important to sift your flour.

, If your flour is not tightly compact, you may be able to skip the sifting process for some recipes. However, if you're making something that is meant to have a delicate texture, always sift your flour first. Recipes like angel food cake, for example, will require sifted flour., If you're going to roll out dough, or knead it, flour can help prevent the dough from sticking to a work surface. Sifted flour generally works better in this case, as it will have less clumps and spread more evenly.You should also sift flour if you're dusting flour over wax paper to roll out dough for sugar cookies.

Learn the differences between agave and honey before using it as a replacement.,
When using agave as a replacement for honey in cooking, use a 1:1 ratio to keep the consistency of the product the same.

,
Lower your baking temperature by 25 degrees Fahrenheit (13.9 degrees Celsius), and lengthen the cooking time when using agave.,
When using agave in cooking to replace dry sweeteners such sugars, reduce the liquid contents of the ingredients as needed.

,
Use agave to sweeten cold drinks.,
Sprinkle agave to the top of yogurt, and stir.

,
Sweeten your cold foods, such as fruit salads, with just 1 teaspoon of agave.",How to Use Agave Instead of Honey,"


Since agave is derived from a plant, it is considered vegan, unlike honey which comes from bees. Agave is deemed a viable, natural sweetener for those following a vegan diet.
Agave does not crystallize as honey sometimes does because it is high in fructose.
While honey has a unique taste and imparts its flavor to the food that is being sweetened, agave has a subtler flavor and lends little or no taste to a dish or beverage.
Agave tastes sweeter than honey because of higher fructose content.
Honey is not recommended for children under the age of 1 due to the presence of a few botulism spores. Agave may be consumed by people of all ages.
Agave has a thinner consistency than honey.
Agave is great for adding body fat because of the high fructose content.

,, Since agave browns more quickly than honey, you don't want the food to pick up a burnt taste or turn an unappetizing color.

,, Honey will solidify in cold liquids, while agave will not. Agave can also be used to sweeten iced tea by drizzling the desired amount into the beverage and stirring.;
,, Experiment until the desired sweetness is reached. If honey is called for in a cold salad recipe, start by replacing half the recommended amount with agave and add as needed.

Make spicy food.",How to Balance Flavors in Your Cooking1," Different flavors produce different strengths in a dish. Certain types of flavors and spices will be the main thing you taste when eating. Other flavors and spices provide a more subtle taste. Know the general strengths of ingredients to build the right flavor profile.Things like meat, mushrooms, and beans provide what are known as low notes. They are the subtle flavors lingering under other tastes in a dish.
Mid notes are very subtle flavors. While they help inform the taste of a dish, they are not immediately noticeable. Things like raw vegetables and chicken provide mid notes.
High notes define the flavor of a dish. They are the strongest, most notable flavors. In general, spices, citrus, herbs, and peppers make up high notes.;
, Some ingredients round out the flavor in a dish. this means they bring ingredients together and create a unified taste. You rarely taste these flavors, but they're important to unify a dish. Low notes include things like butter, cream, sugar, and salt., For something savory, use the right ingredients to create a strong flavor profile. Savory foods contain ingredients that are saltier and generally not very sweet. Vegetables, meats, and soups can all be cooked with a savory profile.Ingredients that round out savory profiles are things like salt, hard cheeses, and fish pastes.
High notes are things like soy sauce, miso, seaweed, fish sauce, and pickled vegetables.
Low notes are things like cured meats, such as bacon, tomatoes, and mushrooms.

, A sweet profile can be used for a number of foods. Many side dishes, like sweet potatoes, are sweetened before being served. Opt for the right mix of flavors to create a sweet profile.Honey, jam, sugar, and maple syrup are used to round out a sweet flavor profile.
Low and mid-notes for a sweet profile include mostly vegetables. Things like sweet potatoes, corn, carrots, and squash work here. Most fruit can also be used to provide low or mid notes for a sweet profile.
For your high notes, molasses, ketchup, and barbecue sauce can be used. Different types of vinegar, like balsamic and apple cider vinegar, also work well.

, In addition to a flavor profile on its own, adding a splash of sour flavor can help round out sweet and savory foods served together. For example, sweet and sour chicken helps blend the sweet sauce with the savory chicken.Round out a sour flavor profile with ingredients like lemon, lime, or orange juice. You can also use vinegars such as sherry, red, rice, balsamic, and apple cider vinegar.
Tomatoes can provide mid or high notes for a sour profile.
For high notes, try ingredients like tomato paste, yogurt, sour cream, and pickled vegetables.

, Bitter flavors are not used often for main meals, but you may want to add a mild bitter flavor to balance out something very sweet or savory. Bitter flavors may also be used in desserts, dips, or side dishes. Bitter flavors generally do not have a mix of high or low notes and are only tossed in to balance out other flavors.Things like coffee, cocoa powder, grapefruit juice, or beer create a bitter flavor.
Green vegetables, like kale, spinach, and broccoli also provide a touch of bitterness.

, Spice is generally used in sweet, savory, or sour flavor profiles. It can work well to balance out sour and sweet foods. You can add spice by throwing things like hot sauce, wasabi, horse radish, or spicy peppers into a dish. Food like arugula and radishes also have a spicy flavor."

Use a heating pad or warm compress.,
Rest and give your body time to heal.,
Cook animal products thoroughly.,
Wash your hands after handling animals and their feces.,
Don't allow children to handle reptiles and young birds.",How to Treat Salmonella," Salmonella infection is usually caused by eating raw eggs or meat products that are contaminated with the bacteria. There's an incubation period of a few hours to up to 2 days, followed by symptoms that can usually be classified as gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach or intestines.The most common symptoms of a salmonella infection are the following:


Vomiting
Nausea
Diarrhea
Chills
Fever
Headache
Blood in the stool
Very hot temperature
Cold sweats
Head cold
Runny nose;
, While salmonella usually doesn't pose a high health risk, individuals with compromised immune systems, such as people with AIDS, sickle cell disease or inflammatory bowel diseases, are at an increased risk of complications from salmonella poisoning. Children and the elderly are also more likely to experience serious complications. If the symptoms don't seem to be ebbing, and the person experiencing them is in a higher-risk group, it's advisable to see a doctor as soon as possible. Immediate medical attention should also be sought if your or the person you're concerned about experiences the following:



Dehydration, leading to decreased urine output, decreased tear production, dry mouth and sunken eyes.
Signs of bacteremia, a condition in which the salmonella enters the bloodstream and infects body tissues in the brain, spinal cord, heart, or bone marrow. A sudden high fever, chills rapid heart rate and an appearance of serious illness are signs that this may be occurring.

, The doctor will assess the your symptoms and in most cases advise getting plenty of fluids and resting until the symptoms pass, since they usually go away on their own. If the doctor determines a test is necessary, a stool sample will be tested to determine whether it contains salmonella. The doctor may also decide to test a blood sample to determine whether bacteremia has occurred.
The doctor may prescribe antibiotics if the salmonella infection has spread beyond the digestive system.
If dehydration becomes severe enough, the patient may need to be admitted to the hospital to take fluids intravenously.

, Loss of fluids through vomiting and diarrhea creates the risk of dehydration. It is important to replace lost fluid and electrolytes by drinking water, herbal tea, juice, and broth. Even if it doesn't feel good to drink, this is the best way to keep up your body's energy and get past the worst of the symptoms.


Try eating a popsicle, ice chips or some sorbet as a way to get both water and sugar into your system.
Drink plenty of water especially after severe bouts of vomiting or diarrhea.
Children can drink a rehydration solution like Pedialyte to restore fluids and electrolytes.

, loperamide (Imodium A-D) can help to relieve the cramping associated with salmonella-related diarrhea. However, this medication can also prolong the diarrhea itself., Eating salty or spicy foods can further aggravate your already-sensitive digestive system. Avoid rich fatty foods as well, which your digestive tract may find irritating.

, Lay it over your abdomen to help relieve any cramps you may be experiencing. A hot water bottle, or a hot bath, will also do the trick.

, Overdoing it may increase your recovery time. Your body will naturally fight against the salmonella and it will recover more quickly if you do not put undue stress on it. Take a few days off of work or school if you're still experiencing diarrhea and vomiting.

, Don't eat or drink foods that have unpasteurized milk or raw eggs. This is the most common way people get infected with salmonella. Don't hesitate to send undercooked meat, poultry and eggs back to the kitchen when you're eating out.


Salmonella is most commonly found in animal products, but vegetables may also get contaminated. Be sure to wash all your vegetables before cooking them.
Wash your hands and work surfaces after they come into contact with raw poultry, meat or eggs.

, This is another common way that salmonella is spread. Healthy reptiles and birds can carry salmonella on their bodies, and it's also present in cat and dog feces. Any time you handle an animal or its feces, be sure to wash your hands with soapy water.

, Baby chicks, lizards and turtles, for instance, each carry salmonella on their faces. A child cuddling one of these animals could come into contact with salmonella. Since the infection is harder on a child's immune system than an adult's, it's best to forbid children from getting close to animals who could contaminate them."

Your side dishes and main courses should have a more or less even flavor profile.For example, spicy, savory curry goes well with mild soup or rice.
If you're serving dishes in courses, a sweeter salad pairs well with a sour entree.

, Salt is vital to the cooking process. You should not be able to taste salt in a dish. In fact, if a dish tastes salty this is a sign you've added too much salt. A dish, however, should be lightly sprinkled with salt to bring out other flavors. After adding your flavor profile, sprinkle a little bit of salt at a time until the flavors are strong enough., When you're seasoning food, you will be unable to taste your flavors if you do not cleanse your palette. The more you sample food, the less you can taste it. Between taking bites to gauge taste, sip on water or something else with a neutral flavor. This will help you keep your taste buds alert to the precise flavors in your dishes., Always season your food at the temperature you intend to serve it. Hotter temperatures enhance flavors, while cooler temperatures diminish them. It is hard to tell the right flavor when the dish is at a higher or lower temperature than you intend to serve it.If you reheat leftovers, you usually have to salt them to taste afterwards to get the right flavor profile back.

Add salt if a dish is bitter.,
Adjust overly sweet food with bitter or sour ingredients.,
Add sour ingredients wisely.,
Use water to fix an overly salted dish.",How to Balance Flavors in Your Cooking3," A bitter dish can be adjusted with salt. If you added too many bitter ingredients, like bitter vegetables or alcohol-based seasoning, sprinkle some salt over the dish. Add enough salt that the dish loses its bitter flavor., If you ended with an overly sweet flavor profile, add bitter or sour ingredients to balance this out. A small splash of something like, say, lemon juice can balance out a sweet dish.Remember, bitter ingredients include things like coffee, beer, and green vegetables. Sour foods include things like yogurt, sour cream, and vinegars.

, Sour ingredients should be used in small amounts, as they can easily overwhelm a dish. A small squeeze of juice from a lemon, for example, will go a long way. In general, sour is best used to balance out sweet flavors than as a profile on its own., If you can taste the salt in a dish, you've added too much. Luckily, adding a little water can dilute an overly salted dish.If you don't mind a little sweetness, you can also add a sweet ingredient like honey to balance out an overly salty dish. However, you should only go this route if you want to add another flavor to your dish.

Check the expiry date on the bacon packet.,
Be a bit more lenient if it's unopened.,
Smell the bacon.,
Take a good look at the bacon.,
Feel the bacon.,
Throw the bacon out properly.",How to Tell if Bacon Is Bad1," If the ""use by"" date has expired, then that bacon is unsafe to use. Always use bacon within seven days of purchase (""sell by"") or by the ""use by"" date listed by the manufacturer. You can also safely thaw and cook the bacon within four months of freezing bacon.


Take care not to confuse the ""sell by"" and ""use by"" dates. The first is the store's guidance, the latter is the manufacturer's expiration date. The ""sell by"" date signals that you need to get on with consuming the bacon sooner rather than later but the bacon is still safe to eat (provided no other signs of poor storage are revealed).;
, If you bought a package of bacon last week and didn't get around to using it, it's possible it's still good. The same wouldn't be said if you had opened it, taken a whiff, and put it back, but if it's still sealed, it should have a bit longer life.


Your bacon may last for up to two weeks upon purchased if you stored it properly and didn't open it.Open 'er up and do some of the following tests. If it seems like good bacon, your judgment call is probably accurate.

, Whether it's on a plate, or in its packet, it will have the same smell. If you aren't sure that the bacon is good, smell it carefully. If it smells like fresh meat, then it's not spoiled. If it smells weird, like rotting, sour or an offish odor, then it is probably spoiled.


You know what bacon smells like, right? That delicious, Ron-Swanson-is-on-his-way scent? That's the one. If there's even a semblance of a doubt that it smells as delicious as it should, don't risk it. The bacteria ain't worth it.

, Go to a room with a good light source and take a look at the bacon. Good, non-spoiled bacon, should have a fresh, pinkish color and be bright. Bacon is a pink meat with white fat, and sometimes yellowish. If you notice that the bacon has green dots all over, looks dull or that the flesh is turning a gray-brown, then it's not fresh bacon.


You may be thinking at this juncture, ""It's bacon. It's always good. Bacon that exists is good bacon."" Not true. The last thing you want is to have a bad bacon experience, conditioning you to never eat bacon again, right? Think of the long-term risks here.

, Bacon is usually not slimy. If you noticed that the bacon you are holding is slimy, then it's most likely spoiled. Again, throw it out.


And wash your hands afterwards. Just because you didn't eat the bacteria means you should leave it on your hands.

, After you have checked whether the bacon is spoiled, throw it out if necessary. Wrap it well and toss it into the garbage bin outdoors (so it doesn't smell up your indoor trash can). Then wash your hands well. Do not feed it to your pets –– they may be harmed by the bacteria too.

Keep the mushrooms in their original packaging.,
Rewrap the mushrooms with shrink wrap.,
Refrigerate them.",How to Store Fresh Mushrooms1," If you’re not going to use your mushrooms right away, it’s okay to leave them in their original cardboard and plastic wrap packaging. The plastic wrap usually has holes which allow excess moisture to escape without drying the mushrooms out., If you do need a few mushrooms right away, make the smallest hole possible in the original plastic covering. Once you’ve taken the mushrooms you need out of the package, rewrap the area you removed them from with plastic wrap., After you’ve brought the mushrooms home, refrigerate them in their original packaging. Putting fresh mushrooms in the refrigerator slows down the growing process and can prevent them from going bad quickly. Using this technique should keep your mushrooms fresh for about a week."

Use the FIFO system.,
Store produce on the counter if it needs to ripen.,
Store rice and other grains in sealed containers.,
Store root vegetables in paper bags.,
Store fresh bread in paper bags on the counter.",How to Store Food1," ""First in, first out,"" also known as ""FIFO,"" is a common catchphrase used in restaurant kitchens to make sure that the food stays fresh, wherever it is stored. Restaurants go through so much product that every truck delivery usually means that there are only one or two items that have to be rotated forward. For the home cook, this means that canned goods, boxed goods, and other non-perishable supplies should be dated with the date bought. This ensures that a newer item isn't being opened first.


Keep your cabinets, your refrigerator, and all your food storage spaces organized to make sure you know where everything is, and what's the most fresh. if you've got three open jars of peanut butter, something's going to spoil.;
, Fruit should be left to ripen on the counter, either out in the open or loosely in an open plastic bag to promote ripening. Once fruit has reached its desired level of ripeness, put it into the refrigerator to extend the life of the fruit.


Bananas produce ethylene, which speeds up the ripening process of other fruits, so you can take advantage of this property and store them in a plastic bag together with a fruit that needs to ripen. This is an excellent technique for avocados as well.
Never pack fruit into air-tight containers on the counter, or they will quickly spoil. Keep an eye out for signs of bruising or over-ripeness and remove rotten fruit quickly to avoid spoiling the rest.
Be wary of fruit flies, which are attracted to fruit that's spoiled or in the the process of spoiling. Remnants should always be discarded quickly. If you develop a problem with fruit flies, start storing your fruit in the fridge.

, Rice, oatmeal, quinoa, and other dry grains can be kept in your kitchen cabinets in tight, sealed containers. Glass jars, plastic tupperware containers, and any other lidded storage is perfect for storing these bulk items in cabinets or on the counter. This goes for dried beans as well.


If you store rice and other grains in plastic bags, be wary of meal worms. These can be perfectly fine ways of storing rice, but small holes can allow meal worms and moths to breed, ruining large amounts of food. It's always best to keep them in tightly sealed jars.

, If it grows under the ground, it doesn't need to go into the refrigerator. Potatoes, onions, and garlic should be kept in cool, dark, and dry places, not in the refrigerator. If you want to keep them in anything, a loose paper bag is perfectly fine.

, If you've purchased some freshly baked, crusty bread, keep it in a paper bag out on the counter to keep it as fresh as possible. Bread on the counter, properly stored, should be good for 3-5 days, which extends to 7-14 days in the refrigerator.


It's also fine to refrigerate or freeze bread, especially soft sandwich bread, to extend the life. If you live in a particularly humid place, soft breads will mold very quickly if left out, and bread is easy to defrost in the toaster.
If you keep bread on the counter, never keep it in a plastic bag. This promotes mold.

If the toothpick came out wet, put the cake or bread back in the oven and perform the toothpick test again in another five minutes.

",How to Use a Toothpick in Baking1," Open the oven with care.;
, If you don't want to completely remove it from the oven, you can also pull the rack out just enough to access the baked food.

Look for soggy edges.,
Examine cruciferous vegetables for discoloration.,
Throw the item out if you see mold.,
Look for limp stems.,
Check for staleness.,
Examine food for change of texture.,
Inspect cans for rust, dents, or swelling.",How to Tell if Something's Spoiled1," Leafy vegetables will become soggy and/or slimy when they are spoiled. If left for too long, they will begin to turn brown and develop a slimy coating. Discard any leafy vegetables that look like this, as they are inevitably spoiled.You will also notice obvious signs of spoilage in carrots if they are softer and a paler orange color than before.
Grapes will “deflate” and become mushy and soft.
Mold will appear on citrus fruits when they are spoiled, or they may become soft and have a deflated look.
Tomatoes will become wrinkled and will dry out.;
, It can be apparent when your head of lettuce has gone bad, but not as easy to tell with cruciferous vegetables, such as cauliflower. Examine the surface of the florets (a flowering stem that makes up the head of broccoli or cauliflower). If there are dark brown or gray speckles on it, it is in the beginning stages of spoiling. The speckled sections can be trimmed off and the rest used, since the vegetable does not spoil all at once.If you see dark spots all over the florets, snap off a few.
Cut the floret in half lengthwise.
If there is discoloration throughout the floret, throw it out. Any florets without discoloration are usable.
Throw out the entire vegetable if it has become soft and mushy, or if it has mold or insect damage.

, Mold is a definitive indicator that your vegetables or fruits have spoiled. Mold often looks like a fuzzy white, green, or dark-colored spot or spots. Mold can contain bacteria that will make you sick or can be poisonous. Do not risk it.

, Limp stems are indicative of overall wilting of the plant, which is due to the loss of turgor pressure in the plant’s cell walls. The cell walls collapse inward as they lose moisture, causing the leaves and stems to wilt. If left for too long in this state, they can begin to become soft, slimy, and mushy, thereby making them unsafe to eat. But if caught early, they can be revived.Place the greens or vegetables in a sink or large container of ice water for 15-30 minutes.
Drain the sink or container and pat the vegetables or greens dry.
Store in the refrigerator in a plastic bag with dry paper towels to absorb excess moisture. This will prevent the vegetables from spoiling too quickly.

, Though they are still technically safe to eat, stale foods indicate that it is past its prime. Foods that are stale will not be as crunchy or as soft as they once were, depending on what the food is. Though the quality of flavor has been compromised, it is still safe to eat., Most shelf stable foods are safe indefinitely, but if you notice a change in texture, the quality may be compromised. For example, if you notice that any liquids, such as vinegar or oils, have separated, that product may no longer be fresh and/or usable.


If you are still unsure as to whether or not the food is unspoiled, take a whiff. If you notice an odd or foul smell, you may want to toss that food.

, A can that is bulging or has a broken seal should be immediately tossed. Swelling indicates that the food inside has spoiled.


Check the can for any corrosion, which can indicate a problem with the food inside.
If the food inside looks moldy, or cloudy when it should be clear, toss it. If you notice an unpleasant odor or gassiness inside the can or jar, dispose of it.
Canned food that is spoiled may contain bacteria that can cause botulism, which could be fatal. Exercise extreme caution if you notice anything unusual with your canned food."

Decide whether to peel the shrimp before or after cooking.,
Pull off the head.,
Pull off the legs.,
Pull off the shell.,
Leave the tail on or off - it's your choice.,
Save the shells.",How to Peel and Devein Shrimp1," Many cooks maintain that keeping the shell on the shrimp during cooking enhances the flavor, since the shell keeps juices in and is itself packed with flavor. However, some people like to peel the shrimp before cooking, so it's easier to eat the finished dish.





If you want to keep the shell on the body while you're cooking it, but you'd rather not cook it with the legs and vein, use a pair of kitchen scissors to snip the shell along its back. This way you can still devein the shrimp, and peel off the shell when it's done cooking.;
, Sometimes shrimp comes with the head still attached. That's the first thing you should pull off. You can also chop if off if you'd rather.



, Grasp them between your fingers and pull them off in clumps. They should easily detach from the body.




, Start at the head end slip your fingers under the shell. Gently pull it away from the body in one piece.




, Some cooks like the way the tails look in the finished dish, while others prefer to remove it.




, Put them in a bag and freeze them for when you want to make shrimp stock. It's a delicious base for shrimp bisque and other seafood soups.

Purchase the bacon immediately before you check out.,
Look for bacon with just a few ingredients.,
Don't fall for the ""no nitrates added"" sticker.",How to Tell if Bacon Is Bad2," Eliminate the time between bacon retrieval (huzzah!) and the check-out counter. You don't want it to cool down under your pile of Captain Crunch and Miracle Whip. When you get home, promptly place the package of bacon in the refrigerator. Store the bacon at 40ºF/4.4ºC or lower.


If you have a cold storage bag, make use of it! Keep it cool on the journey home. Your bacon deserves an honorable last few days, does it not?

, Nowadays if something doesn't come with at least four ingredients that have 7 syllables, it's something to write home about. Luckily, healthier trends are picking up -- so if you have an extra dollar to spend, go for bacon with a list of ingredients you're confident in pronouncing.


Aim for four or so ingredients -- pork (ya think?), water, salt, and brown sugar. That other stuff is the basics for curing pork (turning it into bacon). The crap in ""regular"" bacon is just preservatives and chemicals.

, That just means that they're not using sodium nitrate when the cure it and instead they use celery. However, celery has loads of nitrates, too (all veggies do), so it's really six of one and half a dozen of the other.


The best bacon will be grown (...suuuure) locally, use very few preservatives, be super fresh, and be from pigs that were raised humanely, of course. That being said, you could always cure it yourself!

Freeze the bacon for long-term storage.,
Cook the bacon, and then store it.,
Monitor frozen bacon.",How to Tell if Bacon Is Bad3," Bacon can be safely frozen up to 1-4 months at 0ºF/-17ºC or lower.However, that said, note that the USDA advises that frozen bacon loses quality after 1-2 months,as bacon rancidity still develops in the freezer.


See How to freeze bacon for a neat trick on freezing bacon slices individually. What other website do you need apart from this one?

, If you've prepared the bacon, it may keep longer if you cook it and then store it in the fridge in an air-tight, resealable container (dab the grease off first).Different types of bacon keep for different lengths of time.


Cooked bacon in strips lasts for around a week post-cooking, in the fridge. If you freeze it, it will last up to 6 months.Just cook it a bit less than you like it, so when you go to warm it up, it doesn't overcook.
Bacon bits will last for about 6 weeks in the fridge, and 6 months in the freezer., If it's in the freezer too long, the fat will go rancid. In addition, the ends could turn hard, brown, and become inedible. If the latter is the case, just whack the ends off and cook as normal. But if it smells, has any of the symptoms described above, or looks funny in the slightest, it shouldn't be eaten.


Slab bacon doesn't freeze well. There's too much salt, causing the fat to go rancid even more quickly. Stick to freezing bacon in smaller sections.

Put mushrooms into a paper lunch bag.,
Leave the paper bag open.,
Store the bag in your refrigerator.",How to Store Fresh Mushrooms2," If you don’t want to store your fresh mushrooms in their original packaging, you can instead store them in a paper bag. The size of the bag can vary depending on how many mushrooms you’re storing, but brown paper lunch bags are generally the best choice.You can also wrap them in damp paper towels before you place them in the bag., Don’t fold over the top of the bag of mushrooms. Leaving it open keeps the level of moisture balanced. The bag will trap some moisture. Leaving it open prevents your mushrooms from soaking up too much moisture., You should store the paper bag of mushrooms in your refrigerator, preferably in one of the crisper drawers. This keeps the scent and taste of other food from getting into your mushrooms. Crisper drawers are also designed to keep fresh vegetables fresher for longer. Using this method should keep your mushrooms fresh for a week to 10 days."
"
Clean the mushrooms first.,
Brush with towel or mushroom brush.,
Slice and sauté the mushrooms.,
Let the mushrooms cool.,
Freeze in plastic resealable bags.",How to Store Fresh Mushrooms3," If you don't plan to use your fresh mushrooms within a week or so, you'll want to freeze them to preserve them. Start by rinsing the mushrooms under water and then letting them dry in open air. You can spread them on a paper or tea towel to catch the excess water., Once the mushrooms are relatively dry, brush them with a paper towel or mushroom brush. This gets some of the more stubborn dirt off of them., Slice your mushrooms into even pieces before you sauté them. Using an egg slicer can give you uniform pieces. Sauté them in one to two tablespoons of olive oil with some salt and pepper to taste., Once you’ve finished cooking the mushrooms, let them cool before you freeze them. Spread them out on a cookie sheet in a single layer until they are cool to the touch.

, Once the mushrooms have cooled, store them in resealable plastic bags and freeze them. Cooking before freezing them prevents them from absorbing too much moisture when they defrost."

Keep your refrigerator set at the optimum temperature.,
Keep food refrigerated if it's already cold.,
Let leftovers cool before refrigerating.,
Store meat properly.,
Refrigerate store-bought eggs.,
Store cut vegetables in the refrigerator.",How to Store Food2," Refrigerators should be set at or below 40 °F (4.4 °C). The food temperature danger zone, the temperature range where bacteria thrive, is between 41 F and 140 F. Any food that is left out in these temperatures is susceptible bacteria growth which could lead to food-born illness. Always get cooked food put away as soon as possible.Check the temperature of your refrigerator regularly. The temperature can fluctuate depending on how much food is in your fridge, so it's a good idea to keep an eye on it if you're sometimes full up and sometimes running low.

, Some food items can be stored on the counter sometimes and should be kept in the refrigerator at other times. Where do you store bottled beer? Pickles? Peanut butter? Soy sauce? Rule of thumb: If you buy something cold, it needs to stay in the refrigerator.


Items like pickles, peanut butter, and soy sauce are fine to keep in the cabinet at room temperature until you open them, at which point they'll need to be refrigerated. Oil or vinegar-based items usually work this way.
Refrigerate canned foods after opening. Anything, whether it be cooked ravioli or green beans, will need to be refrigerated after you open the can. You can store it in the can itself, or transfer it to a tight-lidded storage container for a closer seal.

, Leftovers should be stored in covered containers, either with lids or loosely with plastic cling wrap or tin foil. The looser, the more likely the food is to stink up the fridge or take on other smells, but it's a perfectly fine way of keeping leftovers, once they've cooled to room temperature.


After food is cooked, transfer it to a larger shallow container instead of a smaller deeper container for storage. The larger container will ensure uniform cooling over a shorter period of time.
Meat and food items that contain meat need to be cooled to room temperature before putting it in the refrigerator. If you place hot meat in a covered container and then immediately into the fridge, the condensation will make the meat spoil much more quickly than normal.

, Consume or freeze all cooked meat within 5-7 days. If you can't get through your leftovers fast enough, consider freezing what's left and defrosting it at a leaner time, when there's less in the fridge.


Raw meat always needs to be refrigerated, kept separate from cooked meat and other products, by wrapping it loosely in plastic wrap in the refrigerator. Watch closely for signs of spoilage. Spoiled meat will turn slightly gray or brown and give off an unpleasant odor.

, Eggs that you buy at the store are sometimes quite old, and should be kept in the refrigerator until they've been used. Keep a close eye on them for signs of spoilage after cracking them, always making sure to crack them into a bowl instead of breaking them into the food you're making.Recently laid eggs that have not been washed are perfectly safe to keep on the counter. If you've purchased eggs at the farmer's market recently, ask if they've been washed and for guidance about proper storage of the eggs.

, Leafy greens, tomatoes, fruits, and other vegetables should be kept in the refrigerator once you've cut into them. To ensure they stay fresh for as long as possible, wash and dry them thoroughly, then pack them in the fridge in a sealed plastic container with a tea or paper towel to absorb excess moisture.


Keep tomatoes out of the fridge unless they have been sliced. In the fridge, their insides turn watery and it shortens their shelf life. Sliced tomatoes can be stored in the fridge in a plastic container.

Freeze food in tightly sealed plastic freezer bags.,
Freeze food in appropriate portions.,
Date and label everything.,
Freeze raw or cooked meat for 6-12 months.,
Blanch vegetables before freezing.,
Put the fruit into the freezer that you want to take out.",How to Store Food3," Whatever item you're going to store in the freezer, the best way to keep it protected is tightly-locking freezer bags that have had all the air squeezed out of them. To prevent ""freezer burn,"" which occurs when items become both frozen and dried out, freezer bags are the safest and simplest method.


Plastic tubs or tupperware containers are also effective at storing some kinds of food more effectively. Especially juicy berries or cooked meat can sometimes be less desirable to store in bags, as well as soup and other things that would be difficult to defrost.

, To use the food after freezing it, you'll have to defrost it in the refrigerator. For this reason, it's usually good to freeze food in portions that you'll use. So, don't freeze that entire salmon, freeze a single dinner-sized portion at a time, so you'll have what you need when you need it.

, Is that last summer's blackberries or some venison from 1994 at the back of your freezer? When things get iced-up, it can start getting hard to tell the difference. To avoid the headache of positively identifying everything, try to label and date everything that you put into the freezer, so you'll be able to recognize it quickly and easily.

, Meat should stay fine in the freezer for up to six months, but will start drying out and becoming less palatable beyond that. It's safe to eat, still, since it's frozen, but the flavor will start to taste more and more like the freezer and less and less like the food that went into it., It's usually recommended that vegetables should be cooked before freezing them, rather than cutting them up and freezing them raw. It's more difficult to return vegetables to their natural, unfrozen state. Frozen vegetables are easy to throw right into soups, stews, and stir-frys, making it an excellent way of managing leftover produce items.


To blanch vegetables, cut them into bite-sized pieces and dip quickly into salted boiling water. No more than a minute or two, and immediately take them from the boiling water into a waiting bath of icy water to shock them and stop them from cooking. They should still be firm, but partially cooked.
Place portion-sized amounts of vegetables into freezer bags and label and date them. Allow the vegetables to cool completely before freezing.

, How to freeze fruit depends partially on what you'll be doing with them. If you've got a bunch of berries to make pies with, go ahead and sugar them to create the filling before you freeze them up, so it'll be much easier later. If you're freezing peaches, you might want to remove the skins before you put them in the freezer, because it'll be too difficult to take them off later.


Generally, you want to cut most fruits into bite-sized pieces before freezing, to promote more even freezing. You could put a whole apple into the freezer, but it'll be hard to do anything with it later.

Toss if you see freezer burn.,
Keep food frozen for no more than three to four months.,
Inspect frozen meat.",How to Tell if Something's Spoiled2," Freezer burn is the occurrence of ice crystals or frost inside of food that is a result of the frozen food losing its moisture. Food with freezer burn is technically still safe to eat but the texture and flavor is likely to have changed drastically and may not taste as good as if it were fresh.Freezer burn often occurs as a result of poor packaging, which would allow water molecules to migrate out of the food. Prevent freezer burn by packaging food well before freezing it.

, If left much longer, it is susceptible to freezer burn and the texture will be compromised. This goes for food that is raw, cooked, or prepared in some way. You can better preserve your food by using a plastic bag and squeezing all of the air out of it before sealing the bag completely and placing it in the freezer., Unwrap the meat and smell it. If it smells foul or unpleasant, it has spoiled. If you are still unsure, thaw it in the refrigerator for no longer than two days. After it has thawed, touch the meat to check for stickiness. If it feels sticky or tacky to the touch, it most likely spoiled and should not be consumed.Check the meat for changes in color. Color that has faded or darkened can be indicative of spoilage.

Check your eggs.,
Inspect milk before drinking.,
Toss deli meat if it becomes slimy.,
Discard spoiled meat.",How to Tell if Something's Spoiled3," The best way to tell if an egg is spoiled or not is to crack it and see if it gives off a foul smell. If the egg is giving off a foul smell, toss it immediately, as it is most likely spoiled and not safe for consumption., If your milk begins to have an abnormal texture, odor, or color, discard it. Any of these changes indicate that it has spoiled and is not safe for consumption. Milk can generally be consumed up to seven days after the “sell-by” date on the container., If unsure as to whether or not your deli meat has expired, feel the surface of the meat. If it is slimy or has developed a film over the surface, discard it. It is likely not safe to eat. Furthermore, you can inspect the meat for any discoloration or dark spots. Any gray, brown, green, or black spots is indicative of spoilage and should be discarded immediately., When you purchase meat, use it within a few days or freeze immediately if you do not plan to use within that timeframe. If you have left your meat in the refrigerator for longer than that, inspect it for any off smells and or changes in color. In addition to becoming slimy and unappealing to the eye, it can also become greenish-brown when it has spoiled. Toss it immediately if you notice this is the case.Raw poultry and raw ground meats can remain in the fridge for one to two days.
Raw red meats that are cut into steaks or chops can remain in the fridge for three to five days.
Cooked meat and poultry can last three to four days in the fridge.

Keep the shrimp cold until you're ready to cook them.",How to Peel and Devein Shrimp2," Cut in about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm). The flesh will peel open and reveal a black or white ""vein"" just beneath the surface. This is actually the digestive tract of the shrimp - stomach and colon in all.



, Start lifting it with your fingers.




, Try to pull it out in one piece, so you don't end up with a lot of vein pieces. Use the knife to pry away any flesh that might be getting in the way. Discard the vein once you've pulled it out.




, Some shrimp have a second vein on the belly side. If yours does, use the knife to make a second slit along the belly. Lift out the vein using the knife and your fingers.




, The vein can be sticky, so make sure no bits get left behind.




, Shrimp deteriorate quickly in warm air, and they need to be kept cold. Put yours in the refrigerator or a bowl of ice water.

Take a two tined cooking fork and put one of the tines directly on the dark spot or vein.




,
Firmly hold the shrimp and start pushing the tine into the vein cavity.",How to Peel and Devein Shrimp3," Take a headless shrimp and look at the end where the head use to be attached for a little dark dot or vein just below the shell on the top side of the shrimp.




,, The shrimp will start straightening out as the tine goes down its spine. The pressure will split the spine and roll the shell back at the same time, peeling the shrimp and deveining it all at once.





This method can be done with a shrimp deveining tool you can buy at seafood markets, but a two tined cooking fork will do the same job.
Running cold water over the shrimp as you're forking it helps the vein come out and moves the process along more quickly.

Enjoy your orange!

",How to Peel an Orange1," The ripeness of your chosen orange will play a major part in how easy it is to peel. When selecting the perfect orange for peeling, look for one with a bright orange color, which is pretty firm and heavy for its size.Try to avoid older fruit with wrinkled or bruised skin, as it will be harder to peel and will not taste as good.
Oranges which are still slightly green or light orange in color may be slightly unripe and will be harder to peel as the skin will stick tightly to the fruit.;
, This step is completely optional, but some people claim that rolling the orange before peeling helps to loosen the skin, while also making the fruit extra juicy! To roll the orange, rest it on a flat surface and place an open palmed hand on top. Apply a light pressure and roll the orange for 10-15 seconds. Just don't press too hard - you don't want to squish your orange!








, Try to make the puncture near the top or bottom of the orange, rather than around the sides. This is because the skin along the sides of the orange is thinner and adheres more tightly to the fruit. The looser and thicker skin at the top of the orange will come away more easily and is less prone to breaking.









Some people advocate using your four fingernails to make the initial puncture, but this is more awkward and gets too much skin under your fingernails!
Letting the nail of your thumb grow a little longer than the rest of your fingernails may also help with your orange peeling.

, Work the nail of your thumb under the orange skin until you have a good grip on it. Try not to puncture the fruit, as the juice will escape and make your hand sticky!









Hold the orange over a plate in case you do happen to puncture the skin. This will make cleanup easier after you are finished peeling. Alternatively, a piece of paper towel will do the trick.

, The bigger the section you tear off, the quicker all the skin will be removed. You can work from top to bottom or around the sides. It's up to you.








, It should be much easier now that you have already taken some of the peel off.









Once you become really skilled at orange peeling, you may be able to peel an orange in one peel. This is achieved by tearing the skin off in a circular motion around the circumference of the orange, until you're left with the fruit in one hand and the twisted, snakelike peel in the other!

Grab a sharp knife.,
Insert the pointed tip of the knife into the skin at the top of the orange.,
Continue peeling the orange in a circular motion.,
Alternatively, you can use the knife to make a vertical slice in the orange skin.",How to Peel an Orange2," It doesn't need to be a very big knife, just as long as it has a pointed tip.

, Make a slice across the top of the orange to get started, then continue by rotating the orange in your hand while you use the knife to cut off the peel in one continuous motion.








, The knife should be facing towards you while you peel in a steady controlled manner, with a slight sawing motion. The orange skin should come off in one continuous, spiraled piece, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. Don't worry if a little of the fruit comes away with peel, you'll get better with practice.








, Once you have done this, it will be easy to peel the orange with your fingers. Just make sure you don't slice too deeply, or you will cut the fruit and get orange juice everywhere!

Optionally, wash the onion.,
Trim off the root section.,
Cut the onion into two halves.,
Trim the tops off of each half.,
Peel the skin off.,
Chop, dice, or julienne your onion as needed.",How to Peel an Onion1," This is a good idea if you notice dirt or anything else unappealing on the outside of the onion. You'll be removing the peel, so it isn't absolutely necessary, but it won't hurt anything.;
, Every onion will have a small clump of dirty-looking roots at the bottom. Hold the onion sideways on a clean cutting board and press a sharp knife down to carefully shave off the ""button"" of roots.


Try to cut only the roots. Cutting into the ""meat"" of the onion will release more of the chemicals that cause tears.Since the layers of the onion are held together at the bottom, this will also make it harder keep a grip on them later.

, Place your knife at the top (uncut) end of the onion. Slice the onion in two with a single clean rocking motion. You'll be left with two even-sized halves.


Immediately turn these onions cut side-down. This prevents tear-causing chemicals from being released into the air.

, With their cut sides facing down, drag the knife across the tips of each onion half. You'll now have two onion halves trimmed at either end.

, Lift the skin at the top end of the onion (the end you just trimmed) and carefully peel it down towards the bottom (root) end. If it breaks or tears, discard the torn-off piece of peel, grab another section, and start peeling again. Repeat for both halves.


You can use the tip of your knife to get the peel started if you're having trouble.

, At this point, your onion is peeled and ready to use. Leave both halves laying cut side-down until you start working with them to prevent tear-causing chemicals from being released into the air.


An onion can still make you cry after you've peeled it, so consult the section below if you'd like to learn a few helpful strategies for reducing your tears both during and after the peeling process.

Wash the fruit.,
Place the avocado on a secure surface.,
Slice the avocado in half lengthwise.,
Twist the two halves apart.,
Scoop the seed out with a metal spoon.,
Remove the pit by striking it with a sharp knife and lifting it straight out.You will need to tap the pit with the sharp edge of your knife with enough force to stick into it but not enough to cut through it.,
Glide a metal spoon in between the flesh and the skin.,
Lift the flesh out whole.Slide the spoon back under the bottom of the flesh and scoop it straight up and out.,
Peel away any remaining fragments of skin.,
Cut the avocado into quarters or slices.,
Pinch the peel at the tip of the slice.,
Slowly peel the skin down and off.Peel the skin off the avocado as you would peel a banana.,
Alternatively, slice the skin off with a knife.,
Score the avocado flesh.,
Use a spoon to separate the chunks from the flesh.,
Peel away any remaining fragments of skin.",How to Peel an Avocado," Rinse the avocado under cool to lukewarm running water, scrubbing the peel gently with your fingers.


It is important to wash the avocado even though you will not be consuming the peel. Otherwise, dirt and bacteria from the peel could get onto the flesh as you peel it.
Do not use soap to clean the avocado.
Dry the avocado with a clean paper towel or clean dishcloth after rinsing it.
Note that your hands should be clean before you wash the avocado. Use warm water and soap to scrub your hands for 20 seconds before you begin preparing the avocado.;
, Lay the avocado on its side. It will be easier and safer to cut the avocado on its side rather than on its end since more of the skin's surface will be secured in place.


To help prevent slipping, place a clean dish towel or no-slip silicone mat on the counter or cutting board beneath the avocado., Use a sharp kitchen knife to cut the avocado from top to bottom.

Note that with the avocado on its side, you will be making a horizontal cut through the long side of the fruit rather than the short width side.






Securely grip the avocado in your non-dominant hand. If necessary, hold the fruit with a towel to give yourself more traction and a firmer grip.






Start from the narrower end, or the ""top,"" and across to the wider end, or the ""bottom.""






You will need to cut around the pit at the center of the fruit. You will not be able to cut through it.







, Pick up the fruit in both hands and rotate the halves in opposite directions to twist them apart.


Get a firm grip on both halves of the avocado. Use one hand to twist one half toward you and the other hand to twist the other half away from you. You may need to wiggle and rotate the halves back and forth in order to free them.
When you separate the two halves, the pit will still be lodged into one side of the fruit. You will need to remove it before you can peel the avocado.

, This is the safest technique you can use to remove the pit of the avocado.

Slide the tip of the spoon in between the pit and the surrounding flesh. Gently push the spoon underneath the pit, following the side of the pit as closely as possible.






Circle the spoon around the pit to loosen it from the surrounding flesh on all sides.






Glide the spoon back under the pit of the avocado and lift it straight up and out.







,


This method is not officially recommended since it can be fairly dangerous. Exercise as much caution as possible so that you do not accidentally cut yourself with the knife in the process.
Protect your hand by holding a folded kitchen towel in the palm of the hand you are holding the avocado in. The towel should separate your hand from the avocado.
Gently tap on the center of the seed with your kitchen knife, gradually wedging it further and further in. Slowly increase the pressure of each tap as you progress.
Once the knife is securely fixed into the seed, twist the blade from side to side to loosen the seed. As soon as the seed breaks free from the flesh, lift it straight out by lifting up the knife, bringing the seed with it.

, Slip the tip of a large metal serving spoon into the flesh of the avocado as close the the skin as possible.

Try to insert the spoon into the flesh before the dark green portion of the flesh to preserve as much of the flesh as possible.






Gently push the spoon underneath the flesh, following the curve of the skin as closely as possible.






Slowly glide the spoon around the perimeter of the fruit to completely sever the flesh from the skin.







, If the flesh has been completely loosened, it should come out in one solid chunk.


If there are any parts of the flesh that are still stuck to the skin, the avocado may come out in pieces, instead.
If you accidentally cut through the peel as you were severing the flesh, you may have small pieces of peel stuck to the flesh in several spots.

, If there are any pieces of skin still stuck to the fruit, you can peel them off by digging your nail under the peel and lifting it away.


If you are unable to remove the fragments with your nail, shave them off with a small paring knife, instead.
From this point on, you can cut and prepare the avocado as desired.

, Cut each avocado half in half again, lengthwise, to produce quarters. If desired, you can continue cutting these sections lengthwise to create smaller, easier to handle sections.


Place each half cut-side-down as you cut it into quarters or wedges. Doing so will give you more traction, making it easier and safer to cut the fruit.
Smaller wedges will be easier to peel than wider wedges.

, Use your index finger and thumb to dig into the tip of each wedge, just below the dark green portion of the flesh and just above the skin.


Ideally, you will only have the skin gripped in between your fingers.
Note that this method is also referred to as the “nick and peel” method.,


Hold the fruit in your non-dominant hand.
Grip the exposed tip of the peel with your dominant hand and slowly pull it away from the flesh and downward.
Peel slowly to prevent the flesh from breaking or the skin from tearing as you remove it.

, If the avocado is not quite ripe, the skin may be difficult to remove with your fingers. If this happens, you can glide a small paring knife in between the peel and the flesh.


This is not ideal, however, since you may lose more of the flesh this way than you would by simply peeling the skin off with your fingers.

, Use a paring knife to cut lines into the flesh. Cut a series of three or four parallel lines running from the top to the bottom of each half. Cut another set of lines perpendicular to this first set.


Cut the flesh down to the skin, but do not cut into the skin.

, Glide a large metal serving spoon beneath the flesh, severing the cubes from the skin at the point from which they are still attached.


Gently push the spoon underneath the flesh, following the curve of the skin as closely as possible.
Slowly glide the spoon around the perimeter of the fruit to completely sever the pieces of fruit from the skin.

, If there are any little pieces of skin still stuck to the chunks of fruit, you can peel them off by digging your nail under the remaining peel and lifting it away.


If you are unable to remove the fragments with your nail, you can try shaving them off with a small paring knife, instead.

Wash the carrots under cool running water.,
Place a bowl on your counter top.,
Hold the carrot between the thumb and forefinger of your non-dominant hand.,
Place your vegetable peeler against the top of your carrot where the carrot is the thickest.,
Push the vegetable peeler down along the surface of the carrot to its tip.,
Now peel upward.,
Rotate the carrot slightly and repeat the process until all of the peel has been removed.,
Flip it over and peel the top.,
Place the carrot on a cutting board and chop off the top and the tip of the carrot with a paring knife.",How to Peel a Carrot1," Brush them with a nylon-bristled brush to remove any dirt or impurities from the surface. Washing is a necessary step to remove all pesticides and any lingering dirt.


Sometimes carrots look a bit dingy or funny. This will go away when you peel off the outer layer.;
, The bowl will catch the carrot peels as you remove them from the carrot. You could peel it over the trash, but that leads to a clumsier peel since you have no surface for the carrot to rest against.


You could also just peel the carrot on a cutting board and then scrape the cuttings into the trash when you're done. Whichever.

, Then, turn your non-dominant hand over so that your palm is facing the ceiling (and your hand is underneath the carrot). The carrot should be tilted at a 45-degree angle over your bowl with the pointed tip pointing down into the bowl.


The hardest part about this is doing it fast and not cutting yourself. If you keep your hand below the carrot, at least the latter half of that quandary is solved.

, If the peeler won't reach the top inch or so, that's fine – you'll take care of it in a bit. Most peelers actually have two blades that go both directions. Does yours?


A vegetable peeler only removes thin slices of the skin if you press it against the carrot gently, preserving the layer beneath that contains many of the carrot’s phytonutrients., You will remove a thin layer of skin that should curl and fall into the bowl or onto the cutting board. That's your first slice – congratulations!


Keep the carrot's tip resting on the cutting board, if you're using one. It'll be easier to keep the carrot in place and not move with the force you're applying if it's resting on a stable surface.

, What most people don't realize is that the standard vegetable peeler has two blades that make it possible to peel your carrot from both the bottom and the top, from peeling away from you and peeling toward you. So once you peel down, peel up. Then you go back and forth, back and forth.


What's the point of this? If you're peeling a lot of carrots, you'll go much, much faster with this method. The best chefs are all about taste and efficiency.

, As you're peeling up and down, up and down, gently rotate the carrot in your hand. When you reach the side that you started on, you're finished peeling the base. Easy as pie.

, Sometimes it's easier not to worry about the top at first, your hand is there and the last thing you want to do is cut your wrist. So once you're finished peeling the bulk of the carrot, flip it over and peel the base in the same method, but just covering the last inch or so that needs to be peeled.


If you didn't peel the top at first, of course. Generally not doing so makes the first bit quicker, but then you do have to take the time now to complete it. Whether you do so or not is up to.

, Most people don't use the very tips in their cooking. With those added to the pile, discard the peels in your garbage or put them in your compost pile.


Rinse your carrots once they're peeled and continue to prepare them according to the instructions in your recipe.

Soak the onion in water right after peeling.,
Freeze the onion.,
Peel and cut the onion under a vent.,
Slice the onion next to an open flame.,
Peel and cut the onion under running water.,
Wear goggles while you work.,
Practice peeling and chopping quickly.",How to Peel an Onion2," This is an especially-convenient way to prevent tears — every kitchen has a sink. As soon as you remove the peel from both onion halves, transfer them to a bowl of water. Let them soak briefly. 15 minutes is generally plenty of time.Note that this can make your onion taste a little more mild.
This works because the water draws out the sulfur-containing compounds that cause the stinging effect in your eyes., Believe it or not, simply getting your onion cold can be enough to greatly reduce your tears. Before you peel the onion, stick it in the freezer for about 15 minutes. After waiting, pull it out, peel it, and chop it immediately (you may want to set an alarm so you don't forget about it). Any tears should minor.


This is thought to work because chemical reactions generally proceed much more slowly at low temperatures. Cooling the onion slows the rate at which the tear-causing compounds are released once it's cut open.

, If your kitchen has an oven vent, simply turn it on, move your cutting board over an unlit burner, and start peeling the onion here. The fan in the vent will pull the tear-causing chemicals away from your eyes and safely outside. Higher fan settings tend to reduce tears the most.

, Even small flames (like the ones on candles) can help, but a large stove burner is generally best.The closer you can get the onion to the flame while you're peeling and cutting, the better. However, be sure to stay at least an inch or two from it to avoid burning the onion (or yourself).


This trick works because the flame pulls in air as fuel while it burns. If it's next to your onion, some of this air will be the air that contains the tear-causing chemicals., This works the same way as the ""bowl of water"" trick did above. Be careful when working with a knife here — it's easy to lose your grip on a wet, slippery onion, so cuts are a concern. Setting a non-slip cutting board in the sink can help somewhat.

, An easy way to keep yourself from crying while peeling and chopping onions is to simply put a barrier between your eyes and the tear-causing chemicals. Basically any airtight pair of goggles will work — goggles meant for swimming will work fine, as will (clean) chemistry lab goggles.

, The more time a cut onion is allowed to sit out, the more tear-causing chemicals it will be able to release into the air. Expert chefs can often prevent tears while working with onions by simply finishing before the chemicals have a chance to make it to their eyes. If you can get quick enough, you can use this method to avoid tears even when none of the others are available.


This is a matter of long-term practice. Your speed will gradually increase over time as you continue to work with onions. Don't push yourself to rush, especially when you're working with a sharp knife — mistakes can be painful.

, Hold the thick top of the carrot using your non-dominant hand. The carrot should be positioned at a 45-degree angle to the cutting board.


Hold it in between your thumb and forefinger and then flip your hand over so your palm is facing the ceiling. Your hand is underneath the carrot, supporting it.

, If you don’t own a vegetable peeler, a paring knife will get the job done. Just be careful not to peel too much of the meat off the carrot. A gentle scrape of the top will do.


Also be careful not to hurt yourself! Your non-dominant hand shouldn't come anywhere close to the blade's edge. Make sure your fingers are under and to the sides of the carrot, not risking getting cut.

, As you peel and peel, rotate the carrot to expose the raw skin that hasn't yet been peeled away. You should be able to shift it in your non-dominant hand without stopping the process.


Sometimes it's easy to miss the very top of the carrot near where your wrist is. If this is the case, just flip it over and take care of the base by holding the tip and resuming your technique.

, Then, discard those along with the peels into your garbage or compost pile.

Cut your stalks into thin sticks.",How to Chop Broccoli," Take your head of broccoli and douse it completely under a cool stream of running water from your sink. You may want to run your fingers through the flowery head to knock loose any dirt or insects that are stuck there. Then you can pat it dry with a towel.


Broccoli should not be soaked in water to be cleaned.;
, Broccoli leaves, while high in nutritional content, are rarely used in traditional recipes. Picking off the leaves also makes the broccoli more uniform in appearance, creating a more aesthetically pleasing finished product once you are done chopping your broccoli.Leaves can be thrown away or you might use these as part of a salad, which you could serve as a side dish along with your broccoli., Use your knife or pair of kitchen scissors to cut the florets free of the stalk as close to beneath the florets as you can. The ideal place for this is where the stalk begins to branch into separate florets.The florets are the part of the broccoli that appear like tiny trees branching off from the thick, green stem.
Due to the thickness or position of the florets, you may not be able to get an ideal cut on your first try. Don't worry, you will tidy up your cut broccoli once the florets are completely free of the stalk.

, Start from the outside and work your way in to the center of the floret cluster. You might also peel the florets apart, though doing so will usually require you to make an addition cut or snip to even up the ends of the peeled free broccoli.


Ideally, you should cut the florets about an inch down from where their flowering part begins.
If you are going to cook the florets, try to make them all roughly the same size so that they cook at the same speed.
If you intend to eat the florets raw, the size will not matter and you won’t have to trim them down to an even size., As you cut the outer florets free, you'll be able to move up the stalk, which will result in less trimming later. Cut the florets free until you have removed them all from the stalk., Regular sized broccoli doesn’t just look more pleasing to the eye, it also helps ensure that your broccoli cooks evenly when being prepared for whatever dish you are making. You should leave about ½ inch (1.27 cm) of the stems attached to your florets.


Cutting off too much stalk from the floret can result in your broccoli crumbling apart while cooking or handling., Large, fluffy pieces of broccoli can be a delicious side dish to a meal, but when served in a mixed dish, like stir fry, pieces that are too large can throw off the balance of the mix. Take larger florets of your broccoli and:


Cut the floret in half with your knife or scissors. For smaller pieces of broccoli, halving once may be sufficient for balancing the size of the broccoli. Or...
Halve the two resulting pieces again for larger florets of broccoli. Especially large pieces may need to be quartered for the best size ratio.
Keeping your quartered florets a consistent size will also help them cook at an equal rate., The very bottom of the stalk will be too woody and tough for you to eat. Use your knife or scissors to cut the bottom inch to 2 inches (2.54 to 5 cm) off of the stalk. This part can be either thrown away or composted., The stalk of your broccoli is very similar in nutritional content to the florets, and is sometimes even served in restaurants. However, you'll first have to run a vegetable peeler over it to take off the tough outer layer of skin.


In restaurants, cut broccoli sticks, when cooked, are often served under the name ""coins."", Since the stalk of your broccoli is heartier and denser than your florets, it will take longer to cook. This is why you should cut your stalks into thin sticks, about the size of a normal carrot stick. Use your knife to halve the stalk vertically. Hold these halves together and cut once again crosswise vertically to quarter your stalk.


For especially thick stalks, you can continue halving in this fashion until each piece is as thin as you desire.
The process of cutting vegetables into thin sticks of often called “Julienne style.” This is a common method of preparation, so you might want to learn more about how to julienne vegetables.
You can also line up and cut the stalks with your knife or scissors to cube the sticks."

Cut the onion in half.,
Peel off any additional loose, papery, or discolored layers.,
Cut slices from (but not through) the root end to (and through) the cut off stem end.",How to Chop an Onion1," It may seen counterintuitive at first, but a sharp knife is safer than a dull blade. Dull knives not only mash instead of slice into foods, they slip more easily, especially on round, slick foods like onions. But dull knives are still plenty sharp enough to cut you.;
, Many chefs and experienced cooks chop onions in part by making horizontal slices parallel to the cutting board -- and under their hands and towards their wrists. It works quite well when done properly, but can also cause serious injury if you make a mistake. For the home cook, then, especially if you're a little wary about having a sharp knife in your hand, stick to the methods listed below., Onions are built a bit like the earth -- ever-larger spherical layers surrounding a core -- except with the North and South poles (the stem and root ends) holding everything together. The onion wants to come apart once you start cutting into it, so if you attack it in the right way this falling apart will do much of the chopping for you.

,, Cut off enough so that you can stand the onion up on that flat spot.








, Stand it up on the flat spot, steady it with your free hand, and carefully but forcefully slice down through the root end.








, Work with one half of the onion at a time from this point forward.








, Place the flat side of the onion half down on the board, with the root facing away from you. Hold the onion with your free hand, pierce it with the tip of the knife near the root end, then push the rest of the knife down through the onion. Leave enough of the root end intact to hold the onion together. Make parallel cuts across the onion at the width you desire -- roughly 1/4 inch is usually considered ""chopped.""

Place your ham on a cutting board.,
Use a large fork to stabilize the ham.,





Carve the shank end.,





Remove the slices.",How to Carve a Ham1," Take a large knife and trim off two or three slices from the thin side of the ham, cutting parallel to its length. Then turn the ham so it rests on the flat surface you just created by trimming off the slices.

Use a very sharp knife. Having a sharp knife will help you to cut your ham in thin, perfect slices.
Be sure the knife is long enough to cut through the width of the ham and use long smooth strokes to slice the ham more easily.;
, Pierce the top of the ham with a large fork and insert the fork as far down into the meat as you can. If you hit the bone right away, try moving the fork slightly up or to either side and insert it again. Once the tines are all the way inside the ham, you should have a nice stable handle to hold while making your cuts., Hold the ham with a large fork, start slicing at the shank end (which should be more pointed/tapered than the butt end). Cut thin, vertical slices across the ham, sinking the knife all the way down to the bone for maximum effect., Once the slices are cut, make a horizontal cut that is parallel to the bone. This will release the slices you've made. Place these slices on a serving platter. Turn the ham and continue carve slices using this method until there is no meat left on the bone.

Only carve the ham that you need to serve. Leave the remainder on the bone so that it stays warm and retains more of its juiciness.
Be sure to hang on to the ham bone and any scraps. You can use them to make a delicious soup."

To properly bone a chicken, it helps to have a knife with a fairly flexible, but quite sharp, blade that you can use to work alongside the bones and remove them, as well as scrape the meat from the more difficult joints.;
, Find the backbone. You should be able to feel quite easily where the backbone is with your finger, and carefully work the flat edge of your boning knife down the back, to one side of the bone. Use the bone as a guide, and start working your knife into the skin to create a starting point.


You may find it helpful to cut the skin in several places, then flip the knife edge up and cut through the skin from underneath. You may also find it easier to cut just to the left or the right of the spine when you get started.

, Grasp the skin with one hand, and (carefully!) cut the meat away from the bone, pulling it free as you work.


Start by grasping the skin next to the spine cut furthest away from you. Cut as close to the bone as you can, letting your knife do the work.

, As you start pulling the chicken away from the ribs, you'll encounter the wishbone quickly. Spin the chicken around so the neck hole is facing you, and work your knife around the wishbone to loosen it, pulling it free.


The wishbone is famously easy to break, and might snap as you try to get it out. That's fine, but make sure you get the pieces and be careful of bone shards as you work.

, Keep cutting meat away from the rib cage, slowly moving down from the back, around the side, toward the breast. You'll feel the wing and leg joints as you move, which you'll need to take a little more care to separate and, later, remove.


Work slowly and use pressure to pull the meat away from the ribs to make the knife secondary. Use as small cuts as you can get away with, taking care to not cut through the skin on the other side (the breast). Keep separating until you reach the leg and wing joints.

, Start working down the other side of the backbone, working your knife around much as before, stopping to separate the leg and wing joints before continuing.


Alternatively, you can move to the next step and separate the leg and wing joints before you start on the other side. Save the complete removal of the bones, however, until you've gotten the rib cage completely separated from the meat and can more easily cut them out.

, Grasp the wing in one hand, and the area on the body around the wing joint with the other. Bend the wing back and twist it a bit until the joint pops, then cut through it with the tip of the knife. Locate the gap between the bone and the socket, apply a little pressure, and it should pop free with a little help. Continue working your knife down until you get to the leg.

, Grasp the leg in one hand, and the area on the body around the leg joint with the other. Bend the leg back and twist it a bit until the joint pops. Cut through the leg joint with the tip of the knife, reach in and find the gap between the leg bone and the socket, much as you did with the wing.

, The keel is the cartilage on the breastbone, and is the closest to the skin on the front, so you want to take extra care not to puncture the skin at this point. If you haven't already started working your knife down the other side of the carcass, do that now. Otherwise, you should be very close to having removed the carcass entirely from the meat, and there's just a little left to go.


Carefully cut the meat away from the keel. Let your knife scrape alongside the bone, using it to do the work for you. You should be using smooth knife strokes and short motions, rather than stabbing and ripping at the bird. When you work around the keel, pull the ribcage free and discard it.
Before tossing the carcass, consider using it to make stock or soup. It's an excellent starter.

, You should now have a very large flattish piece of meat, but with the leg bones and the wing bones still intact on the inside. To remove the wings, clip off the wing-tips with your knife and push the bone back toward what was the inside of the carcass. Use the edge of your knife to start scraping the meat away until you can pull the bone through entirely.


It's usually easier to use the knife to scrape, rather than trying to get too intricate. You'll conserve more of the meat this way and it'll go much more quickly. Keep scraping away at the small bone until you've pulled it through.

, To remove the thigh bone, carve the meat away from the thigh bone, which should be slightly exposed from where you separated the joint from the carcass. With care, you should be able to remove the thigh and drumstick bones without separating them. Push it up to expose the end and start scraping the meat away, stopping when you get to the knee. Cut around the knee to separate the tissue and continue scraping down the bone, separating as much of the meat as possible.


When you get to the little nubbin on the end (the ""ankle"") put the bone flat on the side and break it, so the rest of the thigh and drumstick comes free, but the nubbin remains. This helps hold the shape of the skin as it cooks, so it won't retract too much from the meat. Some people prefer to leave the legs with the bones in, for presentation. It's up to you.

, Run your hand along the surface of the meat to feel for bone shards or little bits of cartilage and other undesirable bits that you can cut away to make the end product more tasty. Dispose of these bits, and you've got a properly boned chicken.


All the remaining bones and other bits are excellent for making a chicken stock if you want to. Throw it all in a pot with some water and let it simmer for several hours and you'll have a delicious base for soups or stews.

, The most popular use of the boned chicken is to stuff it with your favorite variety of stuffing, sew it up with kitchen twine, and bake it in the oven. For a basic recipe:



Mix up your favorite stuffing using old bread, celery, onions, sausage, sage, or whatever ingredients suit your fancy. Liberally salt the inside and the outside of the chicken, as well as using pepper and other spices to taste. Spoon the stuffing onto the inside of the chicken.
Using a needle of a paper clip, sew up the bird with the stuffing inside. Begin at the neck end and draw the string through both skin and meat on both sides, taking care to make sure it won't pull loose as it cooks. Tie a knot at the end to hold both sides together, then sew your way down the seam. Alternatively, you could sew the bird up before stuffing it.
After you've trussed it up, rub the outside with olive oil or butter and roast the chicken at 375 degrees F (190 C) for 20 minutes per pound of meat.

, A galantine is basically a boned and stuffed chicken that's either poached in some kind of stock, or roasted. Generally, the stuffing includes greens, herbs, and some kind of nuts. Either way, it's usually served with aspic and cut into slices, then served cold as part of a charcuterie plate.

, If it's summer time and you've got the grill going, an entirely boned-out chicken can be a cool alternative to individual bone-in pieces. You can cook the whole thing at once, turning it and basting it with barbecue sauce or beer as it cooks, then serve on buns.


For a trick, weight the chicken down flat with a cast iron skillet, or other heavy-bottomed pan, to keep it grilling evenly., If you're going to go for broke in the boned-out meat department, you might as well go for broke. A turducken is a boned chicken, inside a boned duck, inside a boned turkey. If you've got a whole football team to feed, or you just love the fowl, it can be a fun and completely excessive project. Why not?

All of the organs need to be removed to avoid tainting the meat and increasing spoilage. The quicker you get the animal field dressed and cleaned, the safer the meat will be.


Some people like to winch the carcass up to hang it by the antlers, while some prefer the feet when breaking down the carcass initially. Either works. If you want to save the antlers, you might hang the deer upside down and take special care in dealing with the skull.;
, With the point of your knife, find the joint and make an incision. Then, move your knife around the joint with the flat of the blade, cutting the ligaments and carefully working your knife around the elbow joint as deeply as possible. Twist the joint firmly and snap it off.

, Next, cut around it the base of the neck, then down towards the breastbone, and finally to the stomach, pelvis and the forelegs.


Take care to cut only the skin, and not the muscles or abdominal tissues, as hair will contaminate the meat in these areas.

, Work your way downward toward the chest. If muscle tissue is pulling loose with the skin, scrape or slice through it so it doesn't tear loose as you go. Slicing the subcutaneous membranes will make the skin easier to pull free.

, If skinning by hand, pull the skin down a bit, as if you were peeling paper off a wall, then slice the tissue that attaches it to the muscles underneath it, working a little at a time.


If you want to save energy and use a four wheeler or even a truck, you can tie a golf ball or a similarly sized stone under the skin, looping your rope around it, then tie the free end to the vehicle. Drive slowly away from the carcass, pulling the remaining skin from the deer with very little effort.

, Take the deer down and lay it out on a flat work surface. Just under the jaw, cut the ligaments to loosen the connective tissue around the neck. You'll need to twist the head sharply to break the neck and remove the head completely.


If you want to save the antlers, but not the head, you'll need to use a saw to remove a portion of skull about an inch from the base of the antlers.
If you want to save the entire head, keep it cool and skin it. Save any meat from the skull you wish to keep and boil the skull for several hours, removing the tissue and bleaching the skull. Clean it afterward with hydrogen peroxide to get it white.

, This will wash away any hair that has stuck to the meat and will also help cool the meat while you are completing the job. If you plan to have your deer commercially processed, it's ready to go to the processor after removing the organs. If you want to break it down yourself, let it cool thoroughly and take it indoors or to a clean cutting surface on which you can work.

, Do not wrap it with cling wrap or butcher paper at this point, which will trap heat in the meat and promote spoilage. Make sure the carcass is cool and dry. As soon as possible, the meat needs to be transported and stored at 34–38 °F (1–3 °C).


Avoid freezing the meat right away, as freezing will inhibit the aging process and speed its spoiling after the meat is thawed.

, The most difficult part of the process is finding a space big enough for your deer that can be temperature controlled. The most popular location is generally a garage, shed, or an outbuilding. Places that receive some heat seepage from the house, like a garage, tend to be particularly effective.


If you don't have a garage, talk to friends and other hunting acquaintances to find a suitable location. Or follow the first few steps of the breaking down process to quarter the meat and age it in a spare refrigerator. The quarters from an average deer should fit in a standard fridge.Err on the side of too cold. Generally, you'll freeze at least some of the meat after breaking it down anyway. Be very careful not do let your venison spoil by aging it above 40 °F (4 °C). Make sure to keep a thermometer in your aging space.

, Use a meat hook and chain or rope to affix the meat to a sturdy rafter in your aging location.


If you don't have a meat hook, try using an old wire hanger inside the carcass to hang the deer.

, The quality and flavor of the venison is greatly improved by letting the meat sit for a week in a cool space with good air circulation.


This causes the surface of the meat to dry, but don't worry--this can be trimmed off during the butchering process.
The meat will continue to grow more tender for 16-21 days.

, It's helpful to have a large cleaver and a boning knife for this task. Make sure your tools are sharp and clean and that you've got a sterile work surface large enough to handle big pieces of meat.Try setting up a portable card table or picnic table and cleaning it with food-safe sanitizer before you begin.

, To separate the chuck meat (front quarters) from the round (hind quarters), use a saw or a meat cleaver and find the point at which the rib cage meets the backbone (it should be between the 12th and 13th rib). Cut through the spine using firm pressure with the cleaver.


After you've made an incision, you may need to put one hand on the hind quarters and one hand on the for legs or neck area and bend them toward each other to break the back in half.

, Probably the most tender and tasty cut of venison, the tenderloins are the dark, lean, red meat found inside the cavity, running alongside the backbone. The backstraps or ribeye are also called the ""outside tenderloins,"" and are found opposite the tenderloin, along the backbone on the other side of the ribs.


To remove them, run your knife along the inside of the backbone (for the tenderloin) or the outside of the backbone (for the backstraps), and work the meat loose of the ribs and keeping the edge of your knife as close as possible to the bone, to get as much of the meat as possible. Use long even cuts as you pull the meat away from the bone.
You'll find these in both the hind quarters and rib section of the carcass. This is the best cut for steaks or roasts.

, Cutting them all the way down the backbone, you can either separate the ribs, or leave them intact as whole side of ribs. The brisket can be found on the outside of the ribs, near where you've opened the belly for removing the organs.


Alternatively, you can leave the entire backbone area intact for cutting into chops with a meat saw later. To do this, leave the tenderloins and backstraps in place, and remove the upper shoulders by cutting the muscles that attach them to the chest, working from the bottom (the armpit) up, lifting on the leg as you do so. Since there are not joints in the bones connecting the front shoulders to the chest, a good, sharp knife is all you will need.

, Many people do not realize how much meat a deer's neck has in it. This meat isn't as good for steaks, but is ideal for grinding into sausage or cubing for stew meat. Work your knife around the shoulder joint, twisting the arm away from the body as you loosen it.

, The hams of the deer are the fatty meat found around the back hips or the rump of the deer, and the hocks are the remaining leg meat above the joint where you removed the hooves. Hams make decent steaks and hocks are good for stewing.


If you want to leave the bone in, cut the hindquarters from the deer by sawing through the pelvic bone on either side of the spine, then separate the ham from the hock by cutting through the joint.
If you want to remove the hams from the bone completely, work the hind legs off the hip by working your knife into the ball and socket joint, lifting the leg away from the carcass as you work. Next, position the ham at a perpendicular angel and about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from the top, perpendicular to the leg bone, and cut straight down through the ham. Cut the meat from the leg bone by shifting your knife parallel to the bone. You can immediately cut this meat into steaks or leave it whole for stewing or roasts.

, It's usually more effective to cut the meat into the cuts you'll want to eat before you freeze the meat. That way, you'll be able to defrost a little at a time, rather than having to worry about defrosting a whole side of ribs that will be difficult to use all at once.Use the lower half of the hams for stews and pot roasts.
Cut round steaks from the top half of the hams.
Leave the backstraps as long tenderloin cuts or consider cutting into loin chops.
Cut chunks of soup meat form the lower ribs, belly meat, and the neck meat. If you've got a meat grinder, this also makes excellent ground venison or venison sausage.
Use the front legs for pot roast or consider cutting into chops if you like.

, With a very sharp boning knife, remove fat, cartilage, and any bruising, discoloration and dry spots that result from the aging process. Much of the toughness or undesirable gaminess negatively associated with venison can be lessened by removing these parts.

, In labeled meal-sized portions, pack the meat into plastic freezer bags. Squeeze as much of the air as possible out of the bags and that the bags are sealed tightly before placing them in the freezer.


Don't forget to date the meat. Meat prepared this way should remain good for at least a year. Ground venison and sausage might lose their flavor more quickly. For the best quality, try to use the ground meats first.

, If you want to prepare and keep some of your meat without freezing it and you have the equipment to smoke meat, venison makes for great cured summer sausage.


You can use a corning brine to create your own venison version of corned beef.

, One of the most popular preparations among hunters, venison jerky is a chewy and delicious way of preparing venison and keeping it for a long time on the shelf. Use a commercial food dehydrator to remove the moisture from the meat, flavoring it to your taste.

Use a vegetable peeler to remove the apple skin.,
Choose to either use an apple corer to remove the core or to manually slice the apple removing the pulp from its core.,
Cut your apple as directed by your recipe.,
Finished.








",How to Peel and Core Apples1," For best results, start at the top of the apple and circle down the circumference of the apple. When done correctly, the peel should come off all in one piece.






;
,









To remove the apple core using an apple corer, insert the apple corer tool in the center of the apple while pushing and twisting. Remove the core by pulling the apple core out. You may need to scrape any remaining apple seeds with a paring knife. Insert the paring knife into the apple and scrape gently until the seeds are removed.
Alternatively you can elect to remove the apple pulp from the core by slicing the pulp away from the apple. To do this take a sharp knife and cut vertically along the side of the apple. Turn the apple and repeat this three times until all four sides of the apple are sliced away from the core.

, Usually, a recipe will either call for apple wedges or apple cubes.









To cut wedges, set each quarter so that the round side is facing up. Then, cut each wedge in half to make 1/8 inch (3.4mm) slices.
To cut cubes, set each quarter on the cutting board so that the round side is facing up. Then, cut the quarter lengthwise into strips approximately 1/3"" (3.4mm) wide. Finish by cutting it width-wise into strips approximately 1/3"" (3.4mm) wide. The result will be many 1/3"" x 1/3"" (3.4mm x 3.4mm) chunks.

, Cut off the pomegranate's top. Then, cut it into quarters. Make each quarter even so they soak for the same amount of time.









Sharpen your knife before you score the pomegranate. Dull knives are both more time-consuming and dangerous. You'll get a cleaner, more accurate cut with a sharp knife.

, For best results, keep the pomegranate fully submerged. Your pomegranate will be easier to seed as it gets colder.







, Expose the arils and the pomegranate skin, and remove the outer skin from the bowl.









Keep a trash can nearby to discard the skin quickly.

, Keep the quarters submerged underwater as you do so for easier seeding. Nudge the seeds out of the skin to avoid them bursting open.

For most pomegranates, three or four whacks is sufficient. If your seeds remain stuck, hit harder or use a larger spoon.

, After you have whacked the pomegranate halves, most seeds should be dislodged. To remove remaining seeds, use a smaller spoon and dig out any seeds left inside.

Select a melon.,
Slice a small portion off the base of the melon.,
Draw a pattern on the melon.,
Cut along the pattern.,
Remove the remaining rind.,
Hollow out the melon.,
Fill the bowl.,
Carve a lid for your bowl (optional).",How to Carve Fruit1," You may use any melon with a firm, hard rind, and no noticeable bruising or soft spots. Watermelons are often used for this purpose due to their size, but any large, hard melon will work.;
, Use the sharpest knife you have, for best control over the carving. Begin by using the knife to cut a small section on one end of the melon, so it will remain in one position. You may stand the melon vertically, or lie an elongated melons on its side for a longer bowl.


A stainless steel or bronze knife may work best, as it is unlikely to discolor the fruit., Use a fine permanent market to trace a pattern onto the melon, such as the silhouette of a swan head and wings. You may draw a pattern freehand, but many people prefer to cut out a paper stencil and trace it. You may find these stencils in craft store booklets or online.


While designs specifically for melon carving may be difficult to find online, many sites are devoted to pumpkin carving templates, which may be easily adapted to a melon.
Position your pattern so it won't cover most of the top surface of the melon, which is typically removed to create a bowl shape.

, Insert the knife into the rind anywhere on the permanent marker lines, and methodically cut through the entire pattern. Depending on the hardness of the rind and the sharpness of the knife, you may slice along the pattern, or use a back-and-forth sawing motion. Be sure to cut through the entire rind, into the flesh underneath.

, Once the whole pattern is cut out, the portions of the rind that won't stay on the melon can be removed. If necessary, make an additional round or oblong cut around the top of the melon, in order to open it up into a bowl shape. Carefully pull these portions off the melon, wiggling or cutting if necessary to detach it from the melon flesh inside.

, Use a melon baller to remove all the flesh from the melon. Scrape the inside surfaces so only the rind remains, or a thin layer of flesh if you enjoy the variation in color.

, Fruit salad is probably the most common filling for a melon bowl. Serve this on-theme dessert immediately, or store it in the refrigerator. Alternatively, use the bowl to hold snacks, a trifle, or any other filling. Melon bowls are rarely used to hold non-food items, since the rind will eventually decay.


Optionally, drain the liquid from the fruit salad before serving by puncturing a couple holes at the base of the bowl and keeping it in a pan.If the contents are falling through large holes at the lower surface of the melon, consider lining the bowl with parchment paper or another material.

, If the top portion of the melon you removed came off intact, you may carve a pattern in it. This can be placed on top of the melon bowl for an attractive lid. This is entirely optional, and most commonly used for abstract designs. If your pattern is more realist, such as the popular swan silhouette, a lid may detract from the design or make it harder to distinguish.

Use a swivel peeler to remove the apple skin.,
Cut the apple in half.,
Make apple quarters.,
Remove the core of the apple.,
Pull the core away from the apple slice if it doesn't fall out on its own.








,
Cut your apple as directed by your recipe.,
Finished.








",How to Peel and Core Apples2," For best results, start at the top of the apple and circle down the circumference of the apple. When done correctly, the peel should come off all in one piece.








, To do so, place it stem up on a cutting board and cut down from the center of the stem.








, Place the halves flat side down on the cutting board and cut each half in half, making quarters.








, Hold each quarter with the rounded side facing in your palm. Use a sharp paring knife to cut a large ""V"" around the core.








,, Usually, a recipe will either call for apple wedges or apple cubes.









To cut wedges, set each quarter so that the round side is facing up. Then, cut each wedge in half to make 1/8 inch (3.4mm) slices.
To cut cubes, set each quarter on the cutting board so that the round side is facing up. Then, cut the quarter lengthwise into strips approximately 1/3"" (3.4mm) wide. Finish by cutting it width-wise into strips approximately 1/3"" (3.4mm) wide. The result will be many 1/3"" x 1/3"" (3.4mm x 3.4mm) chunks.

Cut off a section of cucumber.,
Create a strip by slicing just beneath the skin.,
Make additional strips around the whole cucumber section.,
Carefully turn the white flesh into strips.,
Remove the seeds.,
Trim the petals to a triangular point.,
Add a colorful center.",How to Carve Fruit2," Cut a medium or large cucumber a third of the way from the end, or a small cucumber in half. The exact size is not too important, but the piece you are about to carve should include both an end and a cut surface.


Keep the remaining portions around, as successfully creating a flower for the first time often takes more than one attempt.

, Take a sharp, stainless steel paring knife and place it against the edge of the cut end. Slice off about 1/8 of the circumference of the cucumber, just barely beneath the green skin. Move the knife slowly under the skin, to within 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of the end. Remove the knife, leaving the strip of skin attached to the end.If the strip breaks, you can still continue to use the same cucumber piece as practice.

, Repeat this process until all of the green skin has been formed into strips, or ""outer petals"" of the flower.

, Once again, use your paring knife to create thin strips starting from the cut edge of the cucumber. This time, you will be forming ""inner petals"" of the flower, from the hard, white portion of the cucumber.


This may be more difficult than the peel, as you need to create strips thin enough to bend, but thick enough that they won't break. Go slowly, and take a break if your eyes or hands feel strained.

, Carefully scrape the seeds and pulp out of the center of the cucumber using your knife. If there is still white flesh not turned into strips, you may remove this as well.

, Use the knife or a pair of scissors to trim the end of each ""petal"" into a triangular point. Try to cut each triangle to the same length for a more attractive, symmetrical effect.

, Mimic the pollen center of a flower by cutting a small disc from a carrot, and inserting it at the base between the strips. Other colorful, edible options include a small berry, a circle of tomato peel, or even an actual flower. Small, edible flowers that may look attractive in this position include dandelion buds, clover, or English daisies."

Find several sharp, stainless steel knives.,
Select a melon to practice on.,
Learn how to hold the knife.,
Carve a simple, shallow pattern.,
Cut a grid into this pattern.,
Practice carving smaller shapes.,
Try making angled cuts.",How to Carve Fruit3," Bronze knives may also be used, but other metals are likely to cause discoloration in the fruit. Sharp paring knives or Thai carving knives are ideal. The blade of a knife for fruit carving is often only 2–4 inches (5–10 cm) long, but ideally the handle is long and comfortable to hold.


Optionally, select additional tools for certain purposes. A zester or garnishing tool with a V-shaped stripe may be the most common of these, used to remove strips from the fruit., A melon provides a great deal of space to practice on, and the firm rind holds a shape well. If you are feeling more ambitious, you can carve almost any fruit. Firm fruits such as apple or pineapple are typically easier to carve than soft fruits, such as kiwis or grapefruit.


This method will assume you are using a melon, but most of it can be adapted to other fruits.

, Place the thumb of your dominant hand on the knife handle, right next to the blade. Put your index finger on the dull, upper edge of the blade. Lower your middle finger onto the side of the blade, opposite the thumb.Curve your fourth and fifth fingers around the handle, gripping it comfortably.

, Try to cut or scrape off a simple pattern, such as a heart or a circle, partially through the rind of the melon. Try to cut this to an even depth, without revealing the flesh beneath.

, Score the scraped surface into a grid pattern, without removing any rind or flesh. Through the lines in the grid, you may be able to see the attractive color of the underlying flesh., Carve around this grid or elsewhere on the melon, practicing smaller or more intricate designs. Designs with short, straight lines, such as a diamond pattern, may be easier than designs with curves.


It may take a significant amount of practice to remove the rind around a thin design without breaking it. Try to make sure the section of rind is cut fully through on all sides before removal. If you're having trouble starting the removal, stab the center of the section with the knife and pull gently.

, Angle the knife slightly while cutting, rather than pointing it directly downward, to create a different appearance. This results in a sloping appearance, and can create the suggestion of overlapping designs. For instance, a pattern of ""Vs"" cut out using this technique can create the appearance of flower petals.

Poke a hole in the top of the coconut.,
Turn the coconut upside down over a glass.,
Allow the coconut to drain completely.",How to Open a Coconut1," At the top of the coconut, there are three eyes or indentations. One of these is usually the weakest, so use a sharp knife to poke each one. When you find the eye that gives most easily, insert the knife into it to create a ½-inch (1.27-cm) hole.You can also use a metal skewer or screwdriver to poke a hole in the top of the coconut.;
, To collect the water from the coconut, you’ll need a glass. Place the coconut upside down over it so the hole that you’ve punched in it is directly over the glass.You can also place the coconut over a bowl to collect the water. However, using a glass that the coconut just fits over the top of means that you don’t have to hold the coconut as it drips.
A measuring cup also works well for collecting the liquid.

, After you’ve placed the coconut upside down over the glass, let it sit for several minutes or until all of the liquid drains out. You may need to shake the coconut a few times to get last bit of water out of it.If you are planning to put the coconut in the oven to help open it, you must drain it first. A coconut that hasn't been drained may explode in the oven if it's heated too long.
If you plan to use a mallet to open the coconut, you don't necessarily have to drain it first. However, you can wind up making a mess in your kitchen if you don't, so it's best to start with a drained coconut.
You should collect approximately ½ to ¾ cup (118 to 177 ml) of water from the coconut.
The water from a fresh, young coconut should be sweet. If the liquid has an oily consistency, the coconut likely isn’t good and should be thrown away.

Wash the mango.,
Place the mango on a sturdy cutting board.,
Use the serrated edge knife to cut the mango into three pieces.Mangoes have a flat pit directly in the middle, which you will not be able to cut into.,
Score the mango cheek.Use the knife to make lengthwise and crosswise cuts in the two mango cheeks.Each cut should be about ½ inch apart, and the cuts should not go through the skin.








,
Press the back side of the mango cheek up so the flesh pokes out.,
Trim the segments off with a small paring knife.,
Cut around the pit with a small paring knife.,
Peel the skin from the remaining flesh.",How to Cut a Mango1," Hold the mango under cool running tap water, and gently rub it with your hands as you rinse it.You may also use a clean vegetable brush to scrub the surface of the mango, but this isn’t necessary since you will not be eating the skin.






;
, Using your non-dominant hand, stand the mango up on a cutting board. You will be cutting the mango downwards from the top of it.With your dominant hand, pick up a serrated edge knife.








, The fruit itself is the shape of an oval. When you cut the mango into thirds, make two parallel slices on either side of the pit in the middle, which is about ¾ of an inch thick.









The fattest two edges of the mango are called the “cheeks.”
When cutting the mango, you want a to preserve as much of the cheeks as possible, since this is the part you eat.
You will end up with three pieces: two halves with lots of mango flesh on them, and the middle section that has the pit.

,, The mango segments will stick out, almost like a hedgehog’s back, which is why this is sometimes called the “hedgehog method.” Now, you are ready to remove the majority of the mango flesh.








, Now, you can trim the segments of mango flesh off with a knife and serve it. Careful—the skin is very thin, and if you cut into the skin, you could cut your hand. Sometimes, if the mango is ripe enough, you can simply remove the segments with your hand. Other people like to eat the segments straight off the skin!








, Lay the slice with the pit flat on the cutting board, then trim around the pit with the paring knife. It can be difficult to tell where the pit is, but in general, it begins where the mango is too tough to cut through. It will also be oval-shaped.








, Use your fingers to gently remove the skin from the slice of mango that has the pit. The skin is very thin and is easy to peel off.

Preheat the oven.,
Place the coconut on a pan and bake it for 10 minutes.,
Remove the coconut and wrap it in a towel.,
Place the coconut in a garbage bag and hit it against a hard surface.,
Place a knife between the shell and meat to separate them.,
Peel the fiber away from the coconut meat.",How to Open a Coconut2," To use heat to help open the coconut, it’s important to ensure that your oven is warm enough. Set the temperature to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat., Put the drained coconut on a baking sheet, and set it in the oven. Allow the coconut to bake for approximately 10 minutes or until you see a crack develop in the shell.If the coconut hasn't cracked after 10 minutes, continue to bake it until you notice that the shell is starting to split. Check the coconut every few minutes, though, to ensure that you don't heat it longer than necessary.
If you’re in a hurry, you can also microwave the coconut. Place it on a microwave-safe plate, and heat it on medium-high power for three minutes., When the coconut has started to crack, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Allow it to cool for two to three minutes. Next, wrap the coconut in a small kitchen towel or rag., With the coconut still wrapped in the towel, set it inside a large plastic garbage bag. Twist the bag closed, and whack the coconut against a hard surface several times until you feel it break into pieces.The harder the surface that you hit the coconut against, the easier it will be to break. A concrete surface works especially well.

, When the coconut is broken into pieces, remove it from the garbage bag and unwrap the towel. Take each piece, and wedge a knife between the shell and the white meat of the coconut to carefully separate the two.You don’t necessarily have to use a sharp knife to separate the coconut meat and shell. It’s best to start with a butter knife and only move onto a sharp knife if you’re having trouble.
Steady the pieces of coconut as you’re separating the coconut shell and meat by bracing it against your table or counter.

, After you’ve separated the coconut, there may still be some light brown fiber covering the white meat. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the fiber as you would the skin from a potato or other vegetable. Once you’ve removed the fiber from the meat, you’re ready to eat or cook with your coconut.If you don’t have a vegetable peeler, you can use a sharp knife to carefully peel away the fiber from the meat.

Remove the fiber from the meat.",How to Open a Coconut3," After you’ve drained the coconut, place a folded kitchen towel around one side of the coconut. Use your non-dominant hand to hold it so the part of the coconut not covered with the towel is in front of you.If you prefer, you can steady the coconut against a table or countertop. However, you’ll have to adjust it as you work so you can crack it all the way around.

, Holding the coconut with the towel, use a mallet to firmly tap it. Turn the coconut as you go so you can tap against the entire exterior of until it begins to crack in half.A metal mallet tends to work best for opening the coconut.
If you don’t have a mallet, you can use a hammer to tap the coconut.

, When the coconut has cracked around the entire exterior, use your fingers to split it in two. Set the coconut down on the table or countertop with the cut side facing down.If you find that the coconut doesn’t split easily, repeat the previous step of tapping around the outside with the mallet. There may be some spots where the coconut hasn’t fully cracked.

, With the coconut halves facing down, use the mallet to tap against each piece. That will help loosen the meat from the shell so you can separate the two more easily.Make sure to tap the mallet all over the coconut halves to ensure that the meat is loosened everywhere.
It’s fine if the coconut halves split into smaller pieces when you hit it with the mallet. That can actually make it easier when it’s time to separate the shell and the meat.

, After you’ve hit the coconut halves with the mallet to loosen the meat, wedge a butter knife between the shell and the meat. Use the knife to carefully pry the meat away from the shell until it’s completely separated. Repeat with all of the coconut pieces.Be sure to use a butter knife so you don’t have to worry about cutting yourself as you work.

, Once you’ve separated the meat from the shell, there will still be a thin, brown, fibrous skin on the outside. Use a vegetable peeler to carefully remove the skin so just the meat of the coconut is left.After the meat of the coconut is separated from the skin, you’re ready to eat or cook with it.

, Most onions will have a 1 to 2 layers of thin, papery skin; some may have more. Use your fingers to peel this skin away. You are ready for the next step once you reach the moist, tender skin underneath.

Cut the onion further into wedges, if required. Continue cutting the onion lengthwise, but this time at an angle., Hold the onion by the curved side edges. Rotate it so that the cut root/stem ends are pointing up and down. Cut the onion in half horizontally./images/thumb/f/fa/Cut-an-Onion-Step-22-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Cut-an-Onion-Step-22-Version-4.jpg

, How much you separate the layers is up to you. If you are roasting the onion, you might want to separate all of the layers into individual flakes. If you are making kabobs, you might want to keep the pieces about two layers thick instead.

Keep the temperature of your refrigerator below 41 degrees Fahrenheit (5 degrees Celsius).,
Allow your leftovers to cool completely before refrigerating.,
Transfer leftover canned goods to containers.,
Cover all your foods before placing them in the refrigerator.,
Store raw food away from cooked food.,
Dispose of old or expired foods immediately.",How to Store Food to Prevent Food Poisoning," Temperatures below this level will help maintain the freshness of your food; especially since bacteria thrives in temperatures between 41 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit (5 and 60 degrees Celsius).;
, If you place warm or hot food in the refrigerator, not only can it increase the temperature of your refrigerator, but the steam and condensation captured in the container will encourage the growth of bacteria.


If your leftovers are unlikely to cool within 90 minutes, place your leftovers in small, shallow containers to cool the food faster before placing the containers in the refrigerator. You can also elevate them on a trivet with feet to allow air to circulate underneath the hot food.

, After canned goods have been opened, they can transfer metal properties from the tin over to the remaining food inside, causing contamination.

, This will prevent your food from being exposed to juices, liquids, and other forms of contamination that may come into contact with uncovered food.


Place lids on all food containers or cover bowls with aluminum foil or plastic wrap.

, This will help prevent bacteria from spreading between raw foods, such as chicken and meat, over to your cooked foods.


Don't make a habit of storing your food 'where it will fit' in the refrigerator.
Place your raw food on a plate or in a bowl, then store it on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator to prevent any stray juices from dripping onto your other foods.

, If you continue to store food that is rotten, moldy, or past its expiration date, it may not only be contaminated, but may transfer bacteria to nearby items.


Eat or prepare your food by the ""Use by"" date printed on the packaging. If your food packaging indicates a ""Best by"" date, you may store the food longer; however, it may not retain its quality in terms of taste.

Wash the mango.,
Peel the mango with a Y-shaped vegetable peeler.Grip the vegetable peeler with your dominant hand and stand the mango up with your non-dominant hand.,
Slice the top end and bottom off of the mango.,
Insert a corn-on-the-cob holder in either end of the mango.The two sharp tips of the corn-on-the-cob holder will sink easily into the mango tip.,
Use a knife to cut the mango into three pieces.Mangoes have a flat pit directly in the middle, which you will not be able to cut into.,
Trim the flesh off the pit.",How to Cut a Mango2," Hold the mango under cool running tap water, and gently rub it with your hands as you rinse it.You may also use a clean vegetable brush to scrub the surface of the mango, but this isn’t necessary since you will not be eating the skin.








, Using long strokes, guide the edge of the peeler softly down the edge of the mango.









You do not need to apply much pressure when peeling the skin.
Continue to turn the mango as necessary as you peel every edge.
Use caution; your hands may become very slippery.

, The mango is an oblong shape, almost like a football. The two tips of the mango are the small edges that come to a rounded tip. Slice these tips off so the edges of the mango are flat.








, As you cut off the flesh from the mango, grip the corn-on-the-cob holder. This will keep your hands dry and will make the process of removing the mango flesh less slippery.








, The fruit itself is the shape of an oval. When you cut the mango into thirds, make two parallel slices on either side of the pit in the middle, which is about ¾ of an inch thick.









The fattest two edges of the mango are called the “cheeks,” and these are the two edges you are cutting.
When cutting the mango, you want a to preserve as much of the cheeks as possible, since this is the part you eat.
You will end up with three pieces: two halves of mango flesh, and the middle section that has the pit.

, Using the same knife, trim the rest of the mango flesh off of the mango, leaving only the pit behind. Use the same type of motion you used when peeling the mango: move the knife from top to bottom, scraping off the flesh of the mango.









When your knife cannot scrape any more mango flesh off, this means you have reached the pit.
Now, you are ready to enjoy your mango.

Wash your tomatoes.,
Remove the core.,
Cut the tomato in half.,
Cut each half into slices.,
Cut across the strips to dice the tomato.",How to Dice Tomatoes1," Tomatoes should always be washed under the faucet prior to dicing. Make sure to remove any dirt and debris. Peel off any stickers as well., A small spoon or a teaspoon can be used to remove the core of your tomato. Simply insert the tip of the spoon into the tomato's stem. Dig out the stem using the spoon and then discard it., Hold the tomato with one hand and slice through it using a sharp knife. Start at the bottom of the tomato and cut it in two roughly even halves along the equator., Place each half of the tomato on a cutting board with the flat part facing downward. Make a series of vertical cuts length-wise to make a series of thin strips. Strips should be no more than about a centimeter in length and should be roughly even in size.As you cut, use your fingers to hold the tomato in place.

, Turn the strips sideways. Make vertical cuts across the strips, cutting the tomato into small, diced cubes. Strive to keep the space between cuts roughly even and use your fingers to hold the strips in place as you cut. When you're done, you will have a pile of diced tomatoes."

Wash the tomato.,
Remove the top.,
Cut the tomato in half.,
Cut the tomato into vertical slices.,
Dice the tomato slices.",How to Dice Tomatoes2," Wash each Roma tomato under the faucet, turning it as necessary to wash the full surface and remove dirt and debris. If the Roma tomato has any stickers on it, make sure to remove these prior to dicing., Near the top of a Roma tomato, there is a small stem. Cut off the end of the tomato with the stem so you're left with one flat end.




Some people don't bother cutting off the stem, as it's so small it's largely unnoticeable. If you don't mind the tomato stem, you can skip this step.

, Cut the tomato length-wise to cut it in half. Cut it with one hand and hold it in place with the other. Try to keep the two halves of the tomato in roughly even sizes.



, Turn the two halves of your tomato sideways so you're cutting them length-wise. Make vertical cuts to cut the tomato into thin strips of roughly even sizes.




As Roma tomatoes are smaller than regular tomatoes, be careful when using your fingers to hold the tomato in place. Use only the tips of your fingers and be extra careful to keep your fingers away from the knife.

, Turn your strips sideways and make a series of cuts running across the strips length-wise. This should cut your Roma tomatoes into small cubes. When you're finished, you'll be left with a pile of diced Roma tomatoes.




Strive to keep your cuts the same length so your diced tomatoes are roughly the same size.

"
"
Cut your tomatoes in half.,
Cut the halves into quarters.,
Slice out the seeds.,
Avoid dicing Roma tomatoes.",How to Dice Tomatoes3," Make a cut down the center of the tomato. Try to keep the two halves roughly the same size., Make a series of three to four length-wise cuts across each half of your tomato. This should cut your tomato into quarters. Each quarter should be roughly the same size., Place each quarter on a table or cutting board with the skin side facing downward. Slice a knife across the tomato to cut out the white, fleshy portion of the tomato. The seeds are attached to this portion, so they will be sliced out as well.




Sometimes, seeds linger on the tomato after you cut out of the fleshy portion. If any seeds did not come out, remove them with your fingertips.

, Roma tomatoes are very small and delicate. They tend to have less seeds and the seeds can be difficult to remove without damaging the tomatoes. It's usually okay to leave the seeds of Roma tomatoes intact."
"
Set your tomato on a cutting board.,
Roll the tomato sideways and cut it in half.,
Squeeze the tomato over a bowl to dislodge seeds.,
Use a spoon or your fingers to scoop out any remaining seeds.",How to Seed a Tomato1," Take a clean cutting board from your cabinet. Set the tomato on the board so the stem is facing upward. As this method is fairly fast, it works well when you have to slice a big number of tomatoes for a sauce., When you roll the tomato, make sure the stem is now facing the right. Cut the tomato in half down the center line, sometimes called the ""equator"" line of the tomato.Make sure you choose a sharp knife. You need a quick, clean cut. Serrated knives are not a good option as you'll have to do a sawing motion.Tomatoes are not very big, so make sure to choose a small knife. A large knife may be difficult to handle when cutting a small object.

, Take a bowl from your kitchen. Pick up one half of your tomato and gently squeeze it over the bowl. Some of the seeds and juices should spill out. Repeat with the other half of the tomato.Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly before handling the tomatoes.
Use gentle pressure when you squeeze. You do not want the tomato to bruise or become mushy.

, There will probably be a few seeds still inside the tomato. You can use your fingers to dislodge them. However, if you don't feel comfortable, get a small spoon and use this to dislodge the tomatoes."
"
Slice the tomato into four quarters.,
Slice away the seeds with a sharp knife.,
Toss the tomatoes into a salad.",How to Seed a Tomato2," If you need to seed tomatoes for a salad, cut them in neat sections so they can be easily mixed in with the greens. To start, slice the tomato in half vertically, moving the knife from the stem to the bottom.Cut the two halves in half. You should cut along the white portions of the tomato dividing the halves.
You should be left with four wedges of tomato that are roughly the same size.

, Take a sharp knife from your kitchen. You should go for a small knife, as you'll be targeting tiny sections. Run the knife between the outer layer of the tomato and the cluster of seeds in one even motion. Do this with all four wedges.If any seeds remain on the tomato after you sliced it, you can use your fingers or a spoon to remove any excess seeds.Throw away the seeds when you're finished unless you plan to use them to plant a tomato plant.

, Mix them in with the greens and other vegetables. If you want, you can cut up these slivers of tomatoes into smaller chunks, to help them disperse more evenly throughout the salad.

Cut the tomato in half side-to-side.,
Notice the four sections in your tomato.,
Use a small spoon to scoop out seeds in each section.,
Discard the seeds when you are finished.",How to Seed a Tomato3," If you're doing a stuffed tomato dish, cut the tomato in a way that preserves the shape of both halves of the tomato. To start, set your tomato on a cutting board with the stem facing up.Roll the tomato to the side so the stem is pointing to the right.
Cut the tomato down the middle.

, Roll each half onto its rounded side. When you look on the inside of the tomato halves, you'll notice each half has four distinct sections. These sections contain the seeds, and are divided by pale red barriers. Keep these barriers intact when you seed your tomato, as you'll use them when stuffing it later on., Take a small spoon and carefully scoop out each section of your tomato. Go slowly, as to avoid damaging the barriers between the sections. Make sure to scrape the spoon along the bottom of the tomato to make sure you thoroughly remove all seeds., When you're finished, you can discard the seeds. If you're planning on planting tomato seeds, however, you may want to store them in an airtight sealable container for future use.

Gather your supplies.,
Cut a small cross on the bottom of the tomato.,
Submerge the tomato in boiled water.,
Leave the tomato until the skin begins to peel back.,
Transfer the tomato to the bowl of ice water.,
Peel off the skin.,
Cut the tomato into quarters.,
Remove the seeds with a knife or a teaspoon.",How to Seed a Tomato4," If you want to peel a tomato as well as seed it, this method can work great. To start, you'll need to gather the following:A pot of boiling water
A bowl of ice water
A metal spoon.
A small knife

, After removing the stock, cut a small cross on the bottom of the tomato. This will allow the skin to peel away in response to hot water., From here, transfer the tomato into the boiling water. Make sure the tomato is fully submerged.


If you have a kettle, it may be easier to place the tomato in an empty bowl, boil water with the kettle, and then pour this boiling water over the tomato.
If you're boiling on the stove, take safety precautions. Use the back burners to avoid accidentally knocking your pot onto yourself, causing injury. Make sure you use a pot that fits safely over the burners. Check for any food residue or grease particles before turning your burners on., How long you leave the tomato in the boiling water varies. Usually, however, around 10 seconds should be enough. When you see the skin near the bottom of the tomato has begun to peel, use your spoon to remove the tomato from the boiling water.Do not neglect to use the spoon here. The tomato will be very hot when removed from the boiling water.

, Use the spoon when transferring the tomato, as it will be very hot. Leave the tomato in the cold water until it's cool to the touch., The skin near where you made the cut should already be flaky and peeling off. Use your fingers to gently peel away the skin from the tomato., Place the tomato on a cutting board. Cut it into quarters. Remember to cut the tomato in half from the stem to the bottom. Then, cut the two halves in half, making sure to cut along the white portions of the tomato., Take a knife or teaspoon. Run this along the edge of the tomato and the small portion that contains the seeds. Keep scraping until all the seeds are gone."

Count out how many meals, and what type of meal, you need to plan for.,
Draft up a basic calendar of the week with slots for every meal.,
Make a ""master list"" of your favorite recipes and meals.,
Fill in simple or easily customized meals, like breakfast, first.,
Understand the basics of a well-balanced meal.,
Combine all of your recipes into your week's grocery list.,
Be flexible every now and then.",How to Meal Plan1," A good way to do this is to simply look back on the last week of meals. What days did you go out to eat? What days did you have left-overs? What days did you have plenty of time to make a great, huge meal? It is a generally a good idea to plan your meals for no longer than a week in advance, since plans can change and food might go bad. Jot down all the meals you ate last week and see how many meals, and what type, you need to plan for:



Breakfast: Do you make a unique breakfast sometimes, or do you generally eat the same thing each morning?

Lunch: Do you eat out while at work, or do you pack lunches?

Dinner: What days do you cook? What days do you eat out or eat leftovers?

Snacks: How quickly do you go through snack foods? Do you need these foods, or do you just eat them because you were around.;
, Get a pen and paper and sketch out each day, putting three slots under each for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. You can even print out and use the template found at the bottom of the article, or get a free food planning app online., Collect your favorite recipes online and out of cookbooks, helping you quickly fill in your schedule with new meals. If you don't collect recipes or don't know where to begin, head online and search for recipes with some of your favorite ingredients, your schedule (ie. ""1-hour dinners""), or simply peruse food blogs or websites. A quick internet search for ""best recipes"" will pull up far more food than you could ever conceivably try.


Sites and apps like FoodGawker let you search recipes by style, time, ingredients (including ingredients you want to avoid) and popularity.
Remember to look up sides too, like salads or vegetable dishes, and not just the main course., In general, most people eat 2-3 things every day for breakfast and lunch, and don't often use recipes to determine cereal and milk choices. Note these meals on your calendar, then make a simple list of the various ingredients you might mix and match -- granola, cereal, fruit, yogurt, cold cuts, etc. There is no need to plan out exactly what you're getting now (""12 slices of turkey"") before going to the store. Just write out (""12 slices of cold cuts""), then see what looks good at the store.

, Planning dinners may look daunting, as they are usually made up of 2-3 separate parts. However, the basics of a well-balanced meal are actually pretty simple. You want a main dish, usually a grain (pasta, rice, couscous, etc.), a protein like chicken, beans, or fish, and at least 1-2 vegetables or fruits.


Think of each dinner as three separate parts -- a grain, a vegetable, and a protein. Pick three simple recipes instead of trying to make one all inclusive dish each night.

, Once you have all of your recipes compiled, simply mix and match the recipes together to create a shopping list. You know you'll use everything you buy since it all has a purpose in your week. You may add loose snacks here and there, but, in general, you should cut down on the time and money spent in the store considerably with proper planning.Be sure to check your fridge and pantry before going to see what ingredients you already have.
Some people find planning all meals daunting at first. If so, just start with dinners, then buy the rest of your groceries like normal., No one can plan for everything, and that's fine. Sometimes you may want some spontaneity, and some days you'll get home and just won't feel like cooking. A meal plan is there to make life easier, not bind you to some sort of eating contract.


Try having a ""cook's choice"" night, which you leave open to figure out later that day. This is often a good choice for your shopping day, as you can easily buy the right ingredients for that night's meal on the fly.
While meal plans are a good way to limit costly eating out, you should still free to head out every once and a while."

Calculate the cost of the recipe per serving by dividing the total recipe cost by the number of servings yielded.",How to Cost a Recipe1,";
, List the items you need for your recipe in a vertical column on a piece of paper or spreadsheet.


Create a spreadsheet if you plan to cost a number of recipes. This can be saved as a template and used for future costing.

, Place these to the right of your ""Ingredients"" column. They should read ""Quantity"", ""Ingredient Cost"" and ""Recipe Cost"".

, For example, if you need 4 eggs in your recipe, write 4 under ""quantity"".

, Usually the amount purchased is not the amount used, so you must break the cost down further to arrive at an accurate recipe cost.


Restaurants use the term As Purchased (AP) to determine the purchase price of the amount of the item purchased, such as a carton of eggs or milk.
Restaurants use the term As Served (AS) to determine the price of a single serving of that item.
For example, if you buy a 12 eggs for 3 dollars, then the AP is 3 dollars. By dividing 3 dollars by 12, you find that the AS of an egg is 25 cents. If you plan to use 4 eggs, then that single ingredient will cost $1 for your recipe.

, Using the previous example, you would write 25 cents in this column.

,,, Write that number at the bottom of the ""Recipe Cost"" column, after the ingredients.

, This is sometimes called the ""Portion Cost"". Done!

Find recipes that use similar ingredients to save money and time.,
Engage your family when planning meals.,
Choose healthy options now to eat healthy throughout the week.,
Buy produce that is in season or on sale to save money and eat fresher foods.,
Make a ""theme night"" once a week, such as Taco Tuesdays or Pasta Wednesdays.,
Check the weather to determine what nights you might want hot or cold foods.,
Save your receipts and keep notes on your meal planning, adjusting accordingly.",How to Meal Plan2," Once you get the hang of meal planning, you'll realize it is a fantastic tool to spend your time and money more effectively. For example, find multiple recipes for the Brussels sprouts used on Monday and then buy them in bulk instead of buying a smaller, and more expensive, amount of sprouts. Choose recipes like stir-fries or fried rice that are easily customized at the end of the week, allowing you to throw in all your leftover onions, peppers, and other vegetables.


For example, you might do a chicken salad one night and chicken tacos the next. You can cook all the chicken the first night, then reheat it in taco sauce or seasoning the next., There is no reason you have to do this all by yourself. Moreover, getting the whole family to send in recipes ensures that everyone gets to eat something they want. This is also a great way to help kids expand their palettes and make sure that they eat each night.

, When meal planning healthy recipes, you ensure that you eat healthy food. If you only plan healthy meals, you can can avoid a last-minute box of Mac and Cheese on days you're unsure what to eat. Planning around your schedule takes the stress off of you later in the week to find something healthy each night., Determining what is in season, and how to use it, is difficult at the store, but you can easily plan for seasonal fruits and vegetables at home and pick 2-3 recipes that make use of them. Check out what is on sale online when meal planning, then plan your recipes accordingly., This takes a whole day off of your calendar, making planning that much easier. It also lets you perfect that one option every week. When you're at the store, you can easily start mixing and matching the recipes depending on what is on sale, since you know generally what you'll need for Hot Salad Saturdays., It is no secret that our food preferences change depending on the weather. So, if there is a cold rainy night coming up, prepare for grilled cheese and soups. If a heat wave is coming, look for meals that don't require tons of time over a hot oven or stove, like fresh salads or sandwiches., The first few weeks will be a little odd as you get used to your new system and make changes. Keep all of your receipts to track how much money you're spending, and write down what you think of each recipe. As you keep planning, you'll be able to adjust your schedule depending on changing finances, recipes you love, and currently available produce."

This indicates that the peas are mature. Look for a consistent bright green color free of dark marks or blemishes.If you choose pea pods that are too old, then you run the risk of a fibrous, chewy texture.;
, IF you are taking your peas directly from the field, instead of buying them in a store, then you need to pick them at the perfect time to ensure the right texture and flavor. Aim to pick the pods before the temperature gets too warm. Make sure that you can process the peas immediately after picking.To remove the peas, place your fingers at the spot where the stem meets the pod and gently apply pressure. This should snap the pod off while keeping the vine intact.

, Before you begin the cleaning process, sift through the pea pods with your hands and inspect each one for any markings or cuts. Discard those pods that have obvious blemishes or cuts that go through the pod and into the interior.If you are hesitant to simply throw away damaged pods, you can sometimes cut off the bad portions with a sharp knife, after following the cleaning process.

, Empty all of your pods into a strainer with small holes or slits in the side. Make sure that none of the pods can slip through these gaps. If you have too many pods, then you may need to do the rinsing process in a few separate loads., Take a moment to run your hands under warm water. Scrub them with soap and then dry them thoroughly. This will prevent any bacteria from your hands from coming into contact with your freshly cleaned pea pods., Turn on your tap water and place the strainer under the stream. Gently move the strainer around and use your free hand to move the pods. Try to get water on every pod. Continue to rinse for a few minutes until you no longer see dirt or debris on the pods., These sprays serve the same purpose as a water bath, but are supposed to add an extra layer of protection against dangerous pesticides and bacteria. Follow the directions on the bottle carefully when using.

Doing a thorough cleaning is especially important as some types of snap peas have been placed within the pesticide-laden “Dirty Dozen.”, Place the strainer onto a plate. This will allow the water to continue to run off the pea pods as you choose them for cutting and shelling. There is no need to do anything but air dry them at this point., Choose a single pod. Use either a sharp knife or your fingers to remove the end of the pod that connected to the stem. Cut it through or apply enough pressure so that it snaps away. You do not need to trim the other end, although you may choose to do so.A sharp paring knife is generally the best tool to use, if any, for this task. Make sure to go slowly as the pods can be a bit slippery post-washing.

, After you cut the end off the pod, you might notice a tough string. This string is fairly thick and travels down the length of the pod. Grasp this string with your fingers or pin it against the knife and pull. It should slide out of the pod fairly easily.Be aware that some stores sell prepackaged stringless snap peas. This means that you can wash them and then eat them immediately, skipping the cutting stages., As you finish each pod, set it into a new bowl or strainer. When you are finished with the trimming, give the whole group of pods another quick wash under the water., You can set the pods out to dry on a fresh, clean towel. Or, you can pat them dry one-by-one with a paper towel. Either way, it is important to get them completely dry, especially if you plan to freeze them, as any water will turn into ice crystals., If you want an extra layer of protection against chemicals, you can place your pods into a vinegar solution prior to cutting. Make a solution comprised of 90% distilled water to 10% vinegar. Let your peas sit for 15-20 minutes before removing them.However, be aware that is has been shown that a cold water rinse can remove between 70-80% of pesticides from most produce.

, As soon as you finish the cleaning process, decide immediately whether to store or eat your peas. You can store your peas for up to 4 days in a container with some air circulation in a refrigerator., Once your peas are cleaned you can eat them straight away as-is. They will have a crunchy texture that goes well on top of salads or as a quick snack., If you choose to remove the peas from the pods, then you can place the pods in some boiling water to create pea-flavored stock. This stock can then be used to add flavor to rice and other dishes., Boil the pods, with the peas inside, in water for 5 minutes or so. Add a dash of salt to the water mid-boil. Remove the pods, drain them, and place them immediately in a bowl with cold water., Throw some pods into a saucepan with olive oil and garlic. Add any other vegetables and continue stirring until everything is cooked through. The pods should be cooked after about 5 minutes on medium heat. Remove and eat."

Choose recipes that are ""hits"" in your household, and that you have cooked successfully before. When you are making large batches, you don't want to experiment with new recipes. Assuming you are only making dinners, you don't need to cook thirty different dishes. You can cook several batches of the household favorites like pizza (up to four, if you like a particular dish enough to have it once a week).


Think of some ""master recipes"" that can be adapted to several different dishes. Take a large amount of cheap, normally tough meat, for example, and put it in a slow cooker until it's tender, then shred it and use it in hot sandwiches, enchiladas, etc.
What you decide to cook will also depend on what you found on sale. Many once-a-month cooks base their ""menu"" around which meats they found for a good price.
Soups, stews and casseroles are the easiest to cook ahead of time, but make sure you don't go overboard on these. Keep the dishes varied. Make a big batch of empanadas and/or wontons. Make a pot of tomato sauce with meat in it (or pesto), cook some pasta, and freeze both (stored separately).;
, That includes:


Sour Cream (becomes thin/watery)
Mayonnaise (separates, but is fine if mixed into a recipe)
Cream Cheese (becomes watery and texture changes)
Cheese (crumbles, but is fine for shredding or in recipes)
Fried Foods (lose crispness or become soggy)
Egg Whites- cooked (become tough & rubbery)
Cream Pies (become watery or lumpy)
Cream Fillings (texture changes)
Frostings (texture changes)
Icings made with egg whites (become foamy)
Potatoes don't taste good after being frozen, whether in soup, stew, or casserole.,


Raw Vegetables (lose crispness, but if prepared correctly can be used for cooking or stews & soups.
Yogurt (may change texture)
Heavy Cream (will not whip when thawed but can be used for cooking)
Pastas & Grains (softer after freezing/reheating- undercook before freezing to counter-balance)
Seasonings, onions, green peppers, herbs and flavorings (flavor may increase or diminish with freezing. Add afterwards when possible)
Thickened sauces or stews (may need thinning after thawing)
Gravies or Fat-based sauces (may separate and need to be recombined)

Don't thicken stews until you're ready to eat them. Liquids with cornstarch or flour added can separate after freezing and the texture is not quite right. Thicken after thawing..Soups. Freeze the components of soup separately (broth, chicken, blanched onions, celery, and carrots) rather than freezing the assembled soup. Put the ingredients together when preparing the meal., Let everyone know that your sole focus for that day is cooking--not errands, playing, walking the dog, etc. Be prepared to order pizza or go out to dinner, as quantity cooking can be tiring.

, Look at all your ingredients lists and consolidate them so you know exactly how much of each ingredient you will need. Shop the day before the cooking session. Gather flyers from your local grocery stores and supermarkets to see what is on sale. Visit any wholesale clubs in your area; you can get deep discounts if you buy in bulk, especially when buying meat. You can also save money at farmers' markets. Don't forget to stock up on storage containers and supplies (sealable bags, plastic containers, aluminum foil, plastic wrap).

, You may also want to do some of the minor food preparation. A good example would be to chop onions using a food processor and then refrigerating the chopped onions for later use. Print and tape the recipes to the cupboard doors for ease of reading while cooking.

, Think of your kitchen as an assembly line. Efficiency is key.


Start crock-pot recipes and preparing whole chickens first.
Do common kitchen tasks all at once. For example, if several of your dishes will require ground beef, cook it all at once.
Blanch vegetables before you freeze them to preserve color, flavor, and texture.

, Always seal, label and date the prepared meals. It's no fun playing the guessing game when finding the mysterious freezer dinner.


Freezer bags - Remove as much air as possible. A vacuum sealer is highly recommended. Soups and stews can be poured into freezer bags, sealed, and stacked flat; once they freeze, you can store them vertically like books on a shelf.
Use aluminum pans or line cake pans or casserole dishes with heavy aluminum foil so the food can be removed from once it's frozen; later, you can put it back inside that pan or dish for thawing and serving.

Use a reusable lunch box, not a disposable bag.,
Freeze your ice pack the night before.,
Pour your drink into a reusable thermos, water bottle, or leak-proof cup.,
Use fabric napkins, tea towels, or small cotton bandannas instead of paper napkins or paper towels.,
Use reusable containers for your food.,
Pack a real fork, spoon, and table knife, or a pocket knife for adults.,
Pack leftovers, especially if you have access to a microwave.,
Avoid single-serve and heavily packaged items.,
Buy local or grow your own food.,
Eat less meat.,
Pack no more or less than you need.,
Finished.

",How to Pack a Waste Free Lunch," Choose something durable that you can use for a long time. Many good, insulated models exist.;
, If you pack your lunch the night before, you can also leave the packed bag in the refrigerator overnight. It will stay cold longer with the packaging chilled also.

, Avoid items that are not recyclable, like boxed juices or bags.


This goes for coffee, too. If you drink coffee, make it yourself at home and carry it in a thermos. Use a reusable cup or mug for the stuff. To cut down on even more waste, make yourself some reusable coffee filters and be sure to compost your coffee grounds.
A thermos can also keep soup hot.
Depending on where you work or study, another option might be just to take a reusable bottle or cup and leave it there to refill from the drinking fountain, watercooler, or coffee machine.

, If you didn't have to wipe up any big spills, you'll probably find that you can leave a fabric napkin there for multiple meals.


When it gets dirty, put the new napkin or towel in when you take the old one out, so you don't end up at your destination without one.
A tea towel can also serve as a place mat and/or to wrap your entire lunch if you do not have a lunch box. See How to Do Furoshiki (Wrap and Carry Things With Square Cloth).

, There are plenty of choices besides plastic wrap and plastic bags.


Wrap your sandwich in a ""Wrap-n-mat"" or similar item. This item is plastic on one side to keep your sandwich fresh, as cling wrap does, but it is cloth on the other side and doubles as place mat.
Place your sandwich in a plastic container. A two- or three-cup flat, plastic box holds a sandwich, keeps it fresh, and prevents it from getting squished. It may take up a bit more space, so choose a lunch box with that in mind, if you can.
Use durable, reusable containers to hold wet or messy items: pudding, yogurt, dips, salad dressings, etc.
Use reusable fabric sandwich/snack bags to hold dry items: crackers, grapes, chips, sandwiches, etc.
Consider Mason jars, the kind used for canning. Some spaghetti sauce also comes in these jars. Save the lids from spaghetti sauce and reuse them to carry things like soup (if you have a microwave where you're going) so they won't leak. Only use glass containers if the lunch box won't take abuse on a playground.

, Thrift stores and garage sales frequently have inexpensive, mismatched flatware (if you would rather have a separate one for your lunch box to avoid breaking up a set you use at home). You could reuse plastic ones instead, but metal is a lot sturdier and easier to work with.


Get a couple of sets so you can immediately replace the fork, spoon, and knife any time you take dirty ones out.
If you like, you can make a pouch for your fork and spoon, to keep them clean.

, Using up leftovers that would otherwise go uneaten means less waste. If you like to take leftovers for lunch, get in the habit of preparing extra food whenever you cook at home.

,


Refill small containers from larger ones. You can carry applesauce, yogurt, trail mix, dried fruits and nuts, crackers, and all sorts of things this way, and you get to choose your own portions.
Buy the ingredients for several lunches at once. You will generally use much less packaging buying larger quantities of basic ingredients than buying prepared meals. Use reusable grocery bags when you go.
Cook for yourself and your family. If you are in the habit of taking a granola bar, candy bar, packaged muffin or can of soup, see if you can come up with home-cooked alternatives. Muffins, corn bread, and cookies are all easy to make at home.
Choose fresh fruits and vegetables instead of canned or packaged. Most come in their own truly recyclable packaging, so don't forget to put any peels or cores back into one of the other containers in your lunchbox and take them home to compost.

, Trash is not the only environmental cost of a boxed lunch. Choose foods that haven't been shipped in from long distances, and you'll cut down on fuel usage. You'll eat fresher food, too.

, Meat takes more energy and resources to produce. Skip meat on certain days. If you do take meat in your lunch, put it in with lots of other stuff, such as in a salad, a sandwich or wrap with plenty of veggies, or a hearty mostly-vegetable soup. You'll save money this way, too.

, You eat lunch every day, so you have many opportunities to notice how much you usually need. If you pack too little, you may end up supplementing your lunch with a trip to the vending machine or cafeteria. If you pack too much and don't eat it, food will go to waste. Pack foods you or your family like. If you or they don't like it, it won't get eaten, and it will go to waste.

Pick fresh basil leaves.,
Bring a pot of water to boil.,
Add the 1 1/2 cups of basil to the water.,
Place in a strainer.,
Pat dry.,
Add the basil and oil to a blender.,
Blend the mixture.,
Keep in the refrigerator.",How to Make Basil Oil1," You'll need several handfuls of basil leaves to make 1 1/2 cups of packed leaves. You can use basil fresh from your garden, from the supermarket, or from a local farmer's market.


Basil comes in many varieties. The kind you can most easily find in the United States is sweet basil, which is perfect for use in Italian dishes and soups. Sweet Thai basil is often used in Asian cooking; it is slightly spicier with hints of licorice and cloves. Lemon basil has hints of lemon along with the typical sweet basil flavors. Purple basil types, such as dark opal basil or purple ruffles basil, are also spicier than sweet basil. You can use any of these basil types for your basil oil; it just depends on your taste preference and how you want to use the oil.;
, Using a medium pot, fill it with water. Bring it to a boil on the stove., You can leave them in there for as little as 10 seconds or for up to 60 seconds.The longer you leave it in, the more limp your leaves will be, and you may lose some of the flavor if you leave it in for too long. Blanching the basil helps to maintain its color.

, Dump the pot of water into a strainer, letting the water drain off. Run the leaves under cold water to stop the cooking process. Dump the leaves on a paper towel to dry., Use paper towels to the basil dry from the top. Do not squeeze the basil because you will release too much of the flavor into the paper towels., Dump the leaves into a blender or food processor. Also add in the 3/4 cup of olive oil., Set the blender or food processor to puree, and blend the mixture until the leaves are smoothly incorporated into the oil., If you don't use the basil oil immediately, keep it in the refrigerator in a covered container for 7 days."

The big plus is its really with minimal additional work or effort. Some of the basic reasons you may want to ask yourself are:


Do you want to be more self-sufficient in starting to grow your own produce in your own garden or the local community garden?
Do you want to find ways to improve store bought meals, like noodles, or find something a little better than convenience meals that no longer satisfy?
Are you looking to save money, be more independent or increase your living skills & quality of life? Cooking your own food as well as cooking to share makes so much more connection with the world, family and friends as well as let you gain more appreciation for the food you eat.
Are you keen on slowly building up to growing your own food for more health focused changes to your eating & lifestyle habits? Cooking at home which can be the easiest way to change permanently as it gives you more control over what you eat.
Are you just interested just in how food is prepared and how to find out different methods to make it more interesting?;
, Regularly means getting out almost daily where possible, not just once a week or fortnight, as the quality of fresh food quickly degrades. Shopping is not only something we do often anyway, but it gives us the chance to get outside a little more often and have the chance to try some new things. Working with spoiled food makes home cooking far harder and less enjoyable than it really is because you have to find ways to cover up the staleness or degraded quality rather than working with the lovely flavours and textures of fresh ingredients. Why make a throw-it-all-in soup when you can make a tantalizingly fresh stir-fry?


If there is a local fresh produce store open early in the morning, this is a really great way to get in and out quickly, and to restock your fridge and pantry before work or the duties of the day. As an added benefit, by going early, you get to have first pick of the freshly arrived produce and the whole experience is far less crammed, rushed, and far more enjoyable. And when you come home from work or studies, you don't have to worry about shopping when you're feeling tired
Check for a local fish market near you, Some of them have super fresh fish and seafood at reasonable prices. Make sure you check the quality of the fish before you buy it. The best 2 characteristics are the eyes and gills. The eyes should be crystal clear while the gills should be light red.

, Cookbooks with wonderful photos can be a hugely inspiring source of ideas, even if you only select one or two recipes from each book. To keep down the costs and keep your bookshelf space free, consider using the library; even cooking eBooks are now available for borrowing from many libraries with online resources. And if you want to own the cookbooks, consider purchasing them secondhand; used cookbooks can be very cheaply sourced from yard sales, charity stores, online auctions, and second-hand bookstores.


If you're not familiar with cooking, try to get a book that covers all of the basics of cooking. There is a good number of such cookbooks in publication, and they will be a never-ending useful resource so it's worth spending the money to get a good one that you'll use for years to come. Look for one that covers everything from preparing foods, storing foods, making sauces, baking, using different cuts of meats, explanations of cooking terms, descriptions of fruits and vegetables, etc. Visit a local bookstore and flip through a few before deciding which one works best for you.
Regularly borrowing books on different cuisines from the library can be a fun way of opening your cooking expertise up to a variety of new dishes. You can make a copy of a favourite recipe or two from borrowed books and keep them in a binder.

, As it happens, what makes cooking the hardest is when you don't actually know what to do, or how to do it. Many avoid the kitchen because they don't want to make a mistake and waste food and feel guilty about it and not having that ""knowledge"" makes people have low confidence about cooking. Fortunately, this is quite easy to overcome as there are many ways to learn cooking, including attending a course (where you'll make new contacts and perhaps even new friends), reading the cookbooks and recipe magazines, surfing the web for videos and ""how-to"" manuals, asking friends or family to teach you, or just by watching cooking shows and learning from what you see. The best lesson is always trial and error, but it's quite easy to eliminate the most simple errors for ordinary cooking. Anyone can cook, but only people who take an interest in how cooking methods work can cook well. Developing an interest in experimenting with flavours, textures and methods also make the whole field of cooking far more interesting to explore. As you experiment, check frequently because food can't be uncooked or un-spiced, and keep in mind three distinct objectives of cooking:



Combining flavors and textures. Pretty simple, and great for experimenting. For instance, assemble peanut butter, jelly, and toast into a sandwich. You'll probably get about what you expected, though it might be better or not quite as good.

Softening and browning. Moderate heat, such as that applied by Microwave or steam, breaks down the internal structure of food, softening it (and removing life such as bacteria by a certain temperature) and sometimes drying it out. High heat, such as that applied by frying oil breaks it down further, partly into materials causing the familiar toasted or burnt flavor. The rate of heat application controls how cooked the inside of large items (which can't conduct heat above the boiling point until entirely dried out) will be when the outside is ""done"" or even a little burnt. Low heat cooks evenly (but be sure to heat meat adequately); high heat, past a point, cooks only the outside faster. Cooking with circulating hot water, oil or air, such as simmering, roasting or smoking, cooks from all directions more or less evenly with little or no stirring or turning; some other methods cook unevenly--often desirable (browning a side, for instance). You can experiment here too. If something is not cooking on the inside, or is soggy due to excessive water, when the outside seems done, turn down the heat and let it sit, or microwave it.

Special reactions. Some foods combine to form new and special things under the right conditions: for instance, flour-water-fat ""roux"" gravy, egg-white meringue, or a yeasty, soda- or powder- rising bread shortbread or cake. Some changes can make these unsatisfactory or complete failures. The specifics would depend on the chemistry of the particular cooking technique . It's generally OK to add items in small quantities such as spices or that do not mix in thoroughly such as nuts. Use caution adding items that are widely reactive, often having strong chemical tastes such as sour lemon juice or salty salt, or that affect overall consistency such as oil or shortening.

, Some modern homes have little more than a microwave aside from an oven and stovetop. You can buy portable stoves and small benchtop ovens from camping stores or houseware stores if you don't have access to anything complex. You can often find these secondhand at charity stores and yard sales. Other basic and essential equipment includes:



Measuring spoons and cups, mixing bowls, a wooden spoon and a whisk, baking trays, pots and pans (saucepans) of varying sizes, a steamer, baking trays, spatulas, tongs, knives and cutting boards, a grater or food processor and a sieve. These can all be sourced secondhand easily but if you can afford to buy brand new, purchase the best quality you can afford because many of these items will last you for years.
An apron is highly recommended, or elaborate & pretentious as it seems, a cook or chef's jacket. These can be sourced usually quite cheaply from hospitality suppliers. Unprotected clothes can turn people off cooking after the odd splash or spill has ruined a favourite shirt. Aprons and jackets are quick to remove so when you sit down to eat, or are cooking to impress guests, you have avoided a potential headache having to change. They keep you clean after handling powders (such as flour, turmeric etc), liquids or other staining ingredients. They also can protect you from hot splashes.

, While this may sound simple, there is actually more to it, much like planning an event. All the same, once you get used to what's involved, it soon becomes second nature and it won't seem like a chore at all.


Play close attention to the amount of time you'll spend cutting and preparing food, then the cooking and cleaning up. Add this time up so you know when to start. If you start at 8:30pm to make a dinner that takes 2.5 hours to make it will be too late for most people to eat, so it would better to start earlier. Most recipes will give an indication of preparation time, and with experience, you'll learn to work this out for yourself.
The other time factor to be aware of are foods that cook quickly and those which take longer. Obviously, differences between food such as a three-hour roast versus a toasted sandwich that can be cooked in minutes will be clear to you. However, knowing that some foods in the same group have varied cooking times is important to avoid over- or under-cooking the food. For example, carrots and beans take longer to cook than broccoli, so if you were to steam them, you'd need to add the broccoli later than the carrots and beans, or the broccoli would be overcooked and tasteless by the time the others were cooked. This type of knowledge can mean the difference between a mediocre meal and a truly delicious one. With time and experience, this knowledge becomes innate, provided you don't accept sub-standard cooking! It's best to plan ahead to ensure that all ingredients for a meal are cooked and ready at the point of serving so you don't have overcooked or undercooked food.

, Organise your ""mise en place"". In cooking-speak, this term is used to mean ""have everything ready"". Have your ingredients and tools ready to go for the main cooking so you don't have to run around looking for things. Having your mise en place prepared makes cooking and cleaning vastly easier. It is also much like any task requiring materials – when everything is at hand, there is no need to panic or to suddenly realise that you're out of an essential ingredient!

, Quite often you can wash up tools and dishes as you go so the final clean up is much smaller; this is a smart way of operating as it lessens the end mess and burden and makes cooking, as well as the kitchen psychologically more inviting and less messy. For neat freaks or for people who get easily frustrated when tools go missing, cleaning up as you go is essential.

, As an oven can take 10 minutes to warm up to its required temperature, it's a problem if you're pouring a cake batter into a tray with the oven still cold. Many cakes and baked items need to be placed in the warm oven straight after beating or mixing so that you don't lose the benefits of the chemical reactions occurring in the batter. If you have to leave it while the oven warms up, the consistency and success of the cake or other baked item can change for the worse.


It can be very helpful to read the reasons behind why certain things need to be done, such as chilling, preheating, kneading for certain lengths of time, allowing dough to rise, etc. If you're curious about chemistry, physics, maths, and how the world works, you'll discover that the kitchen is a marvellous place to brush up on your knowledge in these areas in a fun way, and it definitely helps you to better understand the need for doing some things.

, If you're afraid of doing too much tasting, taste just before serving to adjust for salt and pepper, or other flavourings. Chefs are trained to taste the cooking as it comes along; without doing this, they cannot be sure that the dish is turning out the way it is supposed to. Tasting a dish is a great way to ensure bland food or other potential flavour disasters are caught before it reaches the table. Just remember that you should use a clean spoon to do so and wash it after having tasted the food. Bacteria is easily transmitted from the saliva that will get on the spoon. Flavours do change so it's best to add seasoning towards the end, as cooking spices for too long may make them bitter and salt can accumulate in long-cooked meals as liquids evaporate. Other flavours can change as they cook. Things that won't need tasting generally involve food that you're steaming, boiling, or baking in its original state, such as vegetables; things that do need tasting are dishes that you've put together using a recipe.

, If you wish to make homemade preserves, cakes and other treats on a regular basis, aside from cooking ordinary meals, the process is really the same as cooking a meal: Research your recipe, plan your methods and organise your ingredients and tools; then it's easy! Once you begin to feel more confident, you can even start to make preserves, jams, sauces, etc., from harvest gluts so that you can enjoy the food at different times of the year, especially if you have access to a home orchard. And there is nothing more liable to fill you with pride than being able to offer your homemade food as gifts or building some merit donating to charities if you have a surplus.

Harvest roots in autumn if you want to “force” them.",How to Harvest Chicory1," For the best root yield, plant chicory after the last day in March, and before mid-May. Collect the roots between September 1st and November 15th., Use a hand trowel gently, as needed, to coax the root out of the ground, without nicking or bruising it.The roots may be as deep as two feet (61 cm) in the ground.Roots have crowns five to seven inches (13 to 18 cm) in diameter, and tapered taproots. The usable portion of each root is about nine to ten inches (23 to 25 cm).If you don’t want the tops of the plants, they can be added to a compost pile.

, Clip the tops off at two inches (five centimeters) above the roots. Store them in a humid location at 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 4 degrees Celsius) for up to three months., Scrub the roots with a plastic-bristled brush. Chop them into pieces on a cutting board with a sharp, heavy knife. You can also grind them with a strong grinder. Then use them for roasting and/or brewing., After the first frost, dig out roots that have a top diameter of at least 1.5-2 inches (3.8 to 5 cm). Dig them up carefully so that you don’t bruise them, which may lead to rot. Leave the leaves intact.Place the roots side by side in a garden, covered with straw, or in boxes of sand in a cool, dark, frost-free place until needed.”Forcing” vegetables is when you move them to an artificial growing environment, such as a greenhouse, to produce a harvest outside of the normal growing season.
Chicory roots should never be frozen, since freezing temperatures change the chemical makeup of the roots."
"
Trim tender leaves in the springtime.,
Collect the whole plant, or the top only.,
Wash the leaves twice.,
Drain the leaves.,
Store the leaves.,
Blanch chicory in the summertime, if desired.",How to Harvest Chicory2," Look for leaves that are six to eight inches (fifteen to twenty centimeters) long.Chicory leaves are edible throughout the growing season, but become more bitter after early spring. However, you can boil them to reduce bitterness.Leaves are ready for harvesting about 60 to 70 days after planting. The Red Rib variety, however, can be harvested for “baby leaf” in 35 days.

, Use hand clippers to cut the top of the plant off at ground level. Plants with the tops broken off and the root left in the ground will either regrow or add nutrients to the soil.To keep the whole plant, grasp it and pull slowly upwards. Use a hand trowel to gently coax the root out of the ground without nicking or bruising them. Cut them at two inches (five centimeters) above the roots, and keep or compost the roots.

, Rinse the leaves well over a sieve under running water. Pour the leaves over paper towels or a clean work surface. Sort through them to discard any grass or dead leaves. Rinse the leaves again., Jiggle the sieve lightly over the sink to shake off drain excess water. Place the sieve over a container or paper towels and allow the leaves to drain., Don’t freeze chicory leaves, since they will not retain their flavor.Refrigerate raw chicory leaves in a sealed plastic bag for up to ten days.Although chicory root is often dried, the plant’s leaves should be eaten fresh.

, When a chicory patch has blossom stalks, run it over with a lawnmower set very low. Wait until the leaves return, then cover the area with black plastic, weighed down on the edges. Lift the plastic in about two weeks to harvest a crop of blanched leaves.For example, you may want to cover a space four feet (1.2 m) by six feet (1.8 m). You can use large rocks or pieces of pipe to hold down the edges of the plastic.

Collect seeds from vigorous plants in summertime.,
Dry the plants.,
Separate the seeds from the dried plants.",How to Harvest Chicory3," Ideally, choose plants whose leaves have grown freely without trimming. Choose a warm, dry morning when dew is no longer present.Seed collection from chicory is typically done in July.Wear gardening gloves and watch out for small bees, which enjoy chicory flowers., You can dry chicory as you would herbs. To air dry plants, tie them near the ends of the stems in small bunches. Wrap them loosely in muslin or paper bags that will collect any fallen seeds. Place them in a well-ventilated location, that is not in direct sunlight, for seven to ten days.Alternately, you can dry the plants on a rack in an airing cupboard or warming drawer, or use an oven or microwave to dry them.
If you live in a humid location, try using a small commercial dehydrator to prevent mold.

, Find seeds in small clusters between bunches of leaves. Use a tiny spoon or round tweezers to carefully scoop underneath the seeds to extract them. Alternately, a faster method is to either crush the pods in a cloth bag, or plant the entire pod.Place seedpods in a cloth bag, and smash the bag with a wooden mallet. Screen and winnow them to remove unneeded debris.
If you plant the entire pods without separating the seeds, multiple seedlings will grow close together and will need thinning.

Wear protective clothing.,
Search in sunny locations with compacted, well-drained soil.,
Confirm the plant is chicory.",How to Harvest Chicory4," Make sure to put on gardening gloves. If you’re searching in an area where ticks may be a concern – such as a field – wear socks, long pants and a hat. You may also want to put on bug repellant.

, Chicory enjoys cool and moist conditions with soil that has a pH of 5.8 to 6.5.Some places chicory may be found are fields, vacant city lots, gardens, disturbed ground, and alongside rural roads.Make sure to be alert for traffic if you’re collecting wildflowers alongside a roadway. Don’t collect plants from private property or lots with posted “No Trespassing” signs. You can check with your locality – for example, a city hall – if you’re unsure whether or not you’re permitted to collect plants from vacant land.

, Chicory has ragged petals that are usually a blue lavender color, although they can sometimes appear white or pink. Mature buds are about an inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. The plant’s branched stem joints are about three inches (eight centimeters), and the stalk is tall. Leaves are narrow and resemble dandelion leaves.Chicory comes in many varieties. If you’re unsure if a plant is chicory, consult with at least two field guides and/or online plant databases.

Soften hard edges in your garden.,
Plant herbs that bloom.,
Look for self-sowing herbs.,
Utilize ornamental herbs as a natural hedge.,
Mix different textures.,
Incorporate height.,
Use pots if you run out of space in your garden.",How to Grow Ornamental Herbs," Plant an ornamental herb such as silver thyme to fill in cracks or round out what might look like severe corners or edges in your plants.


Use herbs that grow in a bushy formation. The silver thyme does this, and it can be pink or lavender. Be sure it gets plenty of sunshine and is planted in soil and mulch.;
, For example, oregano comes in an ornamental blend that blooms purple and pink. It also blooms for a long time, usually from spring until late autumn.


Focus on ornamental herbs that bloom repeatedly. Catmint is a popular ornamental herb that blooms into a lavender blue color. If you prune it, there are many repeat blooms to enjoy. Catmint can grow into 18-inch (45 cm) blooms, so it makes a lovely flower for a vase.

, Ornamental herbs can be instinctive, and they can move around to accommodate the needs of your garden and take up any empty spaces. For example, Roman Chamomile is not only beautiful, it spreads out in your garden on its own. Sweet woodruff can also work well.


Allow self-sowing herbs to become ground cover. They rarely need much attention. The Roman Chamomile gives off a pineapple scent and is yellow and white.

, You can use herbs that resemble heart plants and have many foliage. Sage bushes can serve this purpose, as well as Evergreen Rosemary, which looks like a small evergreen tree.

, Ornamental herbs can offer variety to your garden, and an herb such as Cardoon is arching, statuesque and bold. It almost looks like a fern and will provide a visual element to your garden.


Look for soft and shiny textures as well. You can try lavender, with its soft green leaves with serrated edges. Bay laurel has even, glossy leaves that might complement other textures.

, You can use ornamental herbs that climb up trellises or other fixtures in your garden. Scarlet runner beans will bring you bright red blossoms and blue podded peas will burst with color as they grow.

, Ornamental herbs look beautiful when potted on their own, placed around your yard, your patio or even inside your house.

Be aware that most herbs will not freeze in a way that retains their former glory.,
Collect herbs after the dew has dried from them.,
Prepare the herbs before freezing.,
Select a method for freezing based on one of the following.",How to Freeze Herbs1," Many will turn mushy but should retain the flavor provided you are prepared to use them for food such as soups, stews, baked goods and the like, rather than for salads or garnishes.


Note that not everyone agrees that herbs can be frozen at all. Some chefs believe it ruins the herbs and should be avoided.On the other hand, others believe it is just fine to freeze herbs.It is recommended that you try it for yourself as an experiment to see whether or not the results work for you.
Herbs thought to be amenable to freezing include: chives, chervil, dill, fennel leaves, parsley and tarragon.Herbs that don't dry well are better frozen (for example, chives, basil, chervil, cilantro and dill.
Keep in mind that some herbs may be better dried than frozen. For example, rosemary will dry really simply without much ado and retains its flavor for a long time.

, The idea is to get them before too many of the oils have evaporated in the heat of the sun but after they're free of the morning dew. However, the need to pick them before the sun has heated them may depend on where you live; if your sunshine isn't too fierce, any time of the day may be appropriate.


The reason to avoid picking herbs that are damp is that they can mildew easily. For the purposes of freezing, it's just more water you need to get rid of.

, Herbs should be free of dirt, insects and any other plant matter. If needed, wash dirty herbs gently but thoroughly and allow to dry completely before freezing. If you know the herbs are from a clean source and can get away with just brushing them or wiping them, this is preferable to washing them too much.


If you have washed the herbs, leave on absorbent paper to soak up moisture, then pat dry.

, Aim to use frozen herbs within two months, to avoid loss of flavor. Herbs kept frozen any longer than this may taste bland or even unpleasant, depending on the type of herb.

Get fenugreek seeds.,
Pick a space to grow your fenugreek.,
Check the soil conditions.,
Schedule to plant around early spring.,
Prepare your soil.,
Soak the seeds overnight before planting them.",How to Grow Fenugreek1," Before you can grow fenugreek for yourself, you will need to obtain the seeds from which the plants grow. If you know someone who already grows this herb, you could ask them for some, but most likely you will need to buy some. Because fenugreek is commonly used in Indian curries and homeopathic medicine, you can try an Indian grocery store or an herb shop. You can also try online stores like Amazon.com, Foodtolive.com, or Nuts.com.Depending on where you buy from and whether or not you buy organic seeds, it will cost anywhere between 25 cents to $1 for an ounce of fenugreek seeds.;
, Although some plants are particular in that they must be planted in tightly controlled conditions, fenugreek can be planted in the soil in your yard, a twelve inch planter, or even an aluminum tray filled with dirt.Ideally you want an area with full sun, but partial shade or even filtered sunlight will also work.Fenugreek does not do well when transplanted, so either plan to plant your fenugreek in the area where it will mature from the beginning, or try using a biodegradable pot that you can plant into the ground later.

, You will want the soil you use to have a well-drained, loamy texture. It should also have a slightly acidic pH balance. 6.4 pH is considered ideal, but anything between 6.0 and 7.0 pH is generally considered acceptable, so test it before you plant your seeds., Fenugreek prospers in warm soil, so any time from spring to early autumn will work for most places. If you live in a colder place, or you want to start growing your fenugreek before spring, you can start it off indoors as early as 5 weeks before the last frost., Fenugreek seeds must be continually kept moist, but you also have to make sure they don't become overwatered. For that purpose you will need to make sure that the water can easily drain away by breaking up any large chunks of soil. You can also mix in river sand to make it drain better, and add organic compost material and manure to help fertilize it better. You'll also need to make sure that there is space to cover your seeds with more potting soil.If you are planting your seeds in an outdoor garden, you'll want to dig the ground up to 25 cm down to break up soil.
If you are using a container (like a pot or an aluminum pan) with loose potting soil instead, you probably won't need to break any of the soil once you've poured it into the container. Be sure to leave some space between the top of the soil and the edge of the container to fill in more soil on top of the seeds once they have been sown., Soaking the seeds overnight before you plant them will help to increase their germination rate.Place the seeds in a bowl or cup of room temperature water and leave them there overnight. In the morning, drain the water before planting the seeds."

Dry chickweed.,
Make chickweed tea with fresh herbs.,
Brew chickweed tea with dried herbs.",How to Harvest Chickweed," Chickweed typically pops up in the springtime. It flowers between May and October. It does not grow well in the summer eat., Chickweed likes wooded areas, parts of your garden or lawn with overhanging trees, shaded meadows or roadsides.You will see it growing at a low height and spreading all over the place. Since many edible and inedible plants grow in this fashion, it is necessary to properly identify the plant at this stage.You can find chickweed in shady, wet areas in cities.Chickweed does really well in cultivated areas such as the side of a farm field or the edges of your garden.Chickweed likes pH balanced soil.Chickweed will often grow beside other edible herbs such as dandelion, cleavers, plantain, horsetail, fennel and nettle., The oval leaves are approximately a half inch to one-inch long (1-2 cm).At first glance, you might think the flowers have ten petals because each of the five petals is deeply indented. If you bend down and take a closer look, you will notice that chickweed actually has five petals that each have a distinctive indentation., You will notice thin, white hair running up the stems. This is the most important feature for identification purposes.


Look at the hairs on either side of a leaf node. On one side of the node, you will see the hairs on one side of the stem. On the other side, you will see them switch sides., Chickweed also grows alongside poisonous plants. Make sure you're picking only the chickweed.Chickweed looks a lot like scarlet pimpernel and spurge, which are both poisonous plants. To make sure you are harvesting the right plant, you should do your research and consult experts.Find an expert in edible plants by contacting your local chapter of a Native Plant Society. Find the local chapter online or in your local phonebook. Give them a ring and ask if you could go on a foraging field trip with a local expert., Chickweed is a delicate plant that easily wilts in the sun. Pick it in the morning before the sun gets to it. If you pick it after a rain, it will be fresh and delicious.If you are harvesting chickweed in order to dry and store the plant, you should harvest the plant when it is flowering.Flowering happens between May and October., You want to avoid picking it in areas like railways or roadsides that have been sprayed with chemicals. Chickweed growing in these kinds of places will taste bad and may not be safe or healthy to consume.If you are not sure where to go, try getting in touch with your local Native Plant Society., You want to grab the top six inches of the plant. Try to grab as many plants as you are able, since it will be too time consuming to pick one plant at a time, With one hand holding the bunch of chickweed, use your other hand to cut off the top six inches of the plants., Chickweed often grows alongside other weeds, such as dandelion. You will need to sift through the chickweed and remove any other weeds or inedible material., If you harvest flowering chickweed with the intent to store it, you will first need to dry the plants. Bundle the chickweed into small batches with all of the plants pointing in the same direction. Tie an elastic band or a string around the base of the stalks. Hang the plants up on your wall with a nail or a tack. When the chickweed is dry, you can pick the leaves off the stems.Store the dried chickweed in an empty tea container or mason jar.
It is best to dry the plants in a well ventilated room without much sunlight.
If you don’t want to hang dry, you can also use a dehydrator.

, Remove the leaves from the fresh chickweed. You will need three tablespoons of chickweed. Pour hot water in a cup. Put three tablespoons of fresh chickweed in the cup and let it sit for five minutes. Strain and enjoy your tea.Chickweed tea is a diuretic.
If you are pregnant, a child or taking other medication, avoid drinking chickweed tea.

, Add two tablespoons of dried chickweed to a cup. Pour boiled water over the dried herb. Let it brew for fifteen to twenty minutes. Strain and enjoy your chickweed tea.If you have skin problems such as insect bites, dry skin or chickenpox, you could use an infusion of chickweed tea. Brew the tea and then add a cup to your bath."

Sow the seeds.,
Cover the seeds with soil.,
Water the seeds.,
Watch for pests.,
Wait for the seedlings to mature.,
Harvest your fenugreek.,
Replant.",How to Grow Fenugreek2," Sprinkle seeds across the dirt in the areas you want your fenugreek to grow. Don't worry about making sure that the seeds are even or perfectly spaced. Fenugreek seeds don't have to be distanced a certain amount of space apart in order to grow properly like some plants.Some people recommend soaking the seeds in water overnight before you plant them., Fenugreek does not need to be buried very deep in soil. In fact, only .5cm, or ¼ inch, of potting soil provides ample coverage for your fenugreek.You will want to be sure they're buried so that scavengers like birds will not eat them., In order for the seeds to germinate (that is, begin to sprout), you will have to water them in the soil. Make sure that the soil is evenly moist. The excess water should quickly drain away, but you will want to continue to keep it well-moistened over the coming days. Sometime between the third and fifth days they should start to bud.Because of the rainy environment that fenugreek adapted to, it's advised that you maintain a steady slow drip watering method instead of pouring water on the surface periodically. Not only will this make water delivery constant and even, it also allows the water to penetrate the soil deeper and more effectively., Although fenugreek does not suffer from too many pests or diseases, you may notice a powdery mildew, aphids, or charcoal rot. Use organic pesticides and avoid over watering to help control any pests or diseases that may try to attack your fenugreek., It takes between 3-4 weeks for the seedlings to be ready to harvest. You will know that it's time by the height of the sprouts, which should grow to about 6 inches or 140 mm tall., Depending on whether you're trying to get leaves or seeds from your fenugreek you will want to vary how you harvest the plant. For leaves, cut the plant at the stem a few centimeters above the soil or pull them up by the roots. For seeds, wait for the pods on the plant to turn yellow, signalling that they've fully ripened, and harvest the seed before the pod pops open., Some varieties of fenugreek do not regrow after flowering.So if you want a constant supply of fresh fenugreek, you should plan to sow seeds every 2-3 weeks, as that is around the time the current set of plants will die.If you want to reuse the same area, especially immediately, you'll want to pull up the remains of the plants after harvesting and compost them."

Wash your hands thoroughly.,
Chill the eggs (optional).,
Set up three bowls.,
Crack the egg.,
Let the whites drip through your fingers.,
Drop the yolk into the last bowl.",How to Separate an Egg1," Scrub your hands with hot, running water and unscented soap, then rinse them off. Besides washing away dirt, this will remove skin oils that can prevent whites from fluffing., Cold yolks are less likely to break than warm ones, and easier to separate from the white.If you store your eggs in the fridge, separate them right after taking them out. If you store them at room temperature, you can put them in the fridge half an hour before you cook — though it's not a big deal if you forget.


Most recipes call for whites or yolks at room temperature. You can warm chilled, separated egg by placing the bowls of yolks and whites in a pan of warm water (not hot) for 5–10 minutes., If you're only separating a couple eggs, you only need two bowls. But if you're separating many eggs, get another bowl to crack the whole egg into. This way, if you break the yolk, you've only lost one egg instead of ruining a whole bowl of whites.The faster method is to crack all the eggs into one bowl and lift out the yolks one by one. It's best to leave this until you've had some practice, since one broken yolk will ruin all your whites., Crack the egg carefully into the first bowl, taking care not to break the yolk. If you can, you can crack the egg gently, then drop it right into your cupped palm instead — or even crack it in one hand.


If you have trouble with shell fragments in your egg, try cracking it against a flat countertop instead of the edge of the bowl.
If a bit of shell falls into your egg, pick it out with your fingers, without breaking the yolk. It's easier to get it out with half of the shell, but that increases the risk of salmonella contamination.

, Reach into the bowl and cup a yolk, lifting it up. Move your hand over to the second bowl and separate your fingers slightly, letting the whites drip through. Use your other hand to gently pull down thick strands of white if it doesn't fall on its own. If there is still white attached to the yolk, pass it back and forth between your hands until most of the white has dripped into the bowl below.

, Move the yolk over to the last bowl and drop it in gently. Repeat the process with all your other eggs.


It typically doesn't matter if the yolks have a little bit of white stuck to the them. As long as the bowl of egg whites is 100% free of yolk, you're fine.

,
Know the difference between sautéing and other frying methods.,
Resist the urge to press down on your meats and veggies.,
Choose a big-enough pan when sautéing.,
Dry your food before sautéing.,
Get a good digital thermometer to read the doneness of meats.",How to Sauté," Chop your ingredients into manageable, bite-size pieces. Cutting them up makes them easier to eat and to handle, and it also helps them cook faster and more evenly.





Different foods will need to be cut differently in order to get the best taste. Carrots, for example, are very fibrous, so you'd do well to julienne them before sautéing. Greens like spinach, on the other hand, will wilt very quickly and therefore won't need to be cut.
Try to cut the ingredients at an equal size. Ingredients chopped down to the same size will cook evenly. Ingredients that are chopped at wildly different sizes will cook unevenly, producing some food that is over- or undercooked. It sounds simple, but it's incredibly important.;
, Because you're sautéing, you want you pan to get hot before putting anything in it. This is important for several reasons:





A colder pan has hot spots.Hot spots are places on the pan where it is inordinately hotter than elsewhere. This can cause uneven cooking, leaving you with some ingredients that are overcooked and others than are undercooked. As you continue to heat the pan, the heat distributes itself evenly over the entire pan, producing a better final product.
Cold proteins on cold pans will dry out the proteins before they even begin to cook. Put a cold piece of chicken on a cold pan and your chicken will likely be much drier than had you started with the pan piping hot. Needless to say, dry food isn't ideal.

, The amount will vary by recipe, and the type of fat you want to choose will affect the final dish being served. Here's a quick primer on whether to choose butter or oil as your fat:





Butter has a smoking point of 350 °F (177 °C), while most oils have a higher smoking point (375-450 °F). This means that butter burns easier than oils. If you're worried about burning your fat while you cook, opt for oils. On the other hand, butter leaves a better ""fond"" (brown crust) and richer taste; if you're cooking over less heat, opt for butter.
One way to solve the flashpoint dilemma of butter is to use clarified butter or ghee. Clarified butter is simply butter with the milk solids removed. Because the milk solids are what end up burning, removing them from the butter should allow you to cook it at higher temperatures.One caution using olive oil. While many chefs prefer the taste of olive oil over other oils, it actually has a lower smoking point than other oils.For this reason, it may be beneficial to cook with a neutral oil like avocado oil (smoke point 480 ºF) and then add olive oil at the very end for taste.

, Remember: you need space to move the food around in the pan. You could use a skillet or sauté pan but a standard frying pan will do the job nicely too.





Remember to start sautéing the food that takes the longest to cook first. Try to stagger the introduction of the ingredients into the pan so that the first ingredients to hit the pan are the ones that take the longest to cook.

, If the ingredients or the fat starts smoking, simply remove the pan from the burner or element for a short spell and consider turning down the temperature.




, It should take around 5 to 7 minutes to sauté most firm vegetables, but you can test a piece by sampling it. While the color of the ingredients is incredibly important, the taste is the real factor in determining whether an ingredient is cooked. Most vegetables sautéd should be cooked al dente, which means just undercooked (as the ingredients will continue cooking even off the heat).





Most recipes will give you cooking times for how long you should cook the ingredients. It's important to remember to only use these cooking times as rough guidelines instead of as strict edicts. Your pan, burner, the cut of the ingredients, and even your level of expertise will affect that cooking time. Try to think of cooking times as suggestions instead of as mandates.
Sample your food obsessively. In case you've never stepped foot into a professional kitchen, you might be surprised to know that chefs taste everything they cook. (""Never trust a skinny chef."") They do this to make sure that the food is cooking properly. Only taste will help you determine whether something is truly done.

, Remove pan from heat and pour ingredients onto a clean kitchen towel or paper towel to remove excess oil.





Alternatively, leave the food in the pan and add any ingredients that will form sauce for the dish.

,, As we've just learned, ""sautéing"" is a pretty specific term. It's distinct from other cooking techniques, such as:






Pan-frying. Pan-frying doesn't involve tossing or stirring like sautéing would. (You pan-fry salmon, but you sauté collard greens.) Plus, pan-frying uses a little bit more fat at slightly lower temperatures than sautéing does.Stir-frying. Stir-frying is essentially the same as sautéing, except for two points. Stir-fry is usually cooked in a wok or wok-like pan, and in stir-fry, the sauce is made in the wok with the ingredients still in the pan, whereas in sautéing, the ingredients are taken out before the sauce is made.

Sweating. Sweating is the process of cooking vegetables, such as onions, for a short while over low heat. The goal is to get the ingredients translucent and limp, not browned and crunchy.

, If you pan is hot enough and it contains enough fat, you don't need to press down on meats or veggies that you're sautéing in order to get them brown. This simply robs them of moisture. Treat your ingredients a little more delicately and they'll taste better in the end. We promise!




, A pan that is overly crowded with ingredients while sautéing will make your cooking time longer and produce uneven results. An 8- or 10-inch pan is probably perfectly acceptable for a dish for two, but a 12-inch pan might be needed for a meal with larger portions.Don't overcrowd!





Non-stick pans are good for some types of cooking, but they don't always produce the best results for sautéing in particular. That's because they don't promote as much browning as steel pans.Consider using a non-stick pan for sautéing greens like as spinach and broccoli while using a steel pan for anything else.

, Even if you've prepared a marinade, try to dry your ingredients off before sautéing. Any moisture still attached to food during the cooking process will cause them to steam instead of sauté. Pat down with a paper towel, if necessary.




, A digital thermometer will be able to tell you when your meat is finished cooking, eliminating the guesswork from the equation. It's a heck of a lot easy than the finger test for checking doneness.





Red meat is fully cooked at 160 °F (71 °C). Medium is measured at 135–140 °F (57–60 °C), while rare is measured at 130 °F (54 °C).Red meat can safely be cooked at varying degrees of doneness, based on the preference of the diner.
Poultry is fully cooked at 165 °F (74 °C). Poultry should always be fully cooked.
Pork is fully cooked at 160 °F (71 °C). Pork should always be fully cooked.
Seafood is generally fully cooked at 125–140 °F (52–60 °C).Seafood is often eaten rare, medium rare or slightly rare without incident. (Most seafood is flash frozen to kill off any parasites immediately after being caught.)

Take note of the wording in your recipe.,
Use a sifter.,
Use a sieve or colander.,
Use a whisk.,
Use a food processor.,
Store your flour in a plastic container.",How to Sift Flour," One important item to address before you start is the wording in your recipe with regards to sifting.


Sometimes the recipe will call for ""1 cup of flour, sifted"". When this is the case, you can simply scoop 1 cup of flour out of the bag and sift it afterwards.
However, some recipes call for ""1 cup of sifted flour"". In this instance, you need to sift the flour before you measure it. You can do this by scooping 1 cup of flour from the bag and sifting it into a bowl. Then use a tablespoon to transfer the sifted flour back into the measuring cup, using a knife to even the top.;
,


Place the flour into the sifter and hold the sifter over the mixing bowl. The higher you hold the sifter, the more air you will incorporate into the mixture.
However, holding the sifter high over the bowl can make a mess, so it's a good idea to place a sheet of waxed paper under the bowl to catch any errant flour. Then it can easily be scooped up and added to the bowl.
Sift the flour by shaking or squeezing the sifter - the flour will fall lightly into the bowl below. If your flour is particularly lumpy, or you need it extra light and fluffy for a certain recipe (such as angel food cake) you can sift it a second time.
If you want to combine the flour with other dry ingredients like baking or cocoa powder, simply place all of the ingredients into the sifter at once and sift as normal.

, If you don't have a sifter, you can easily use a fine-meshed strainer to do the job.


Simply put the flour into the strainer and tap the side or use a fork to sift the flour through.
If you don't have a fine-meshed strainer, a regular strainer or even a colander will do.

, You can also use a wire whisk to mix the flour in a bowl. Although this won't get the flour as light and fluffy as using a sifter, it will help to break up any lumps and incorporate a little air into the flour.


Whisking also allows you to kill two birds with one stone - you can mix all of your dry ingredients together as you aerate the flour.

, A food processor will achieve the same results as a whisk - only faster. Place the flour in the food processor and pulse four or five times. Just make sure the lid is on securely - otherwise you'll end up with flour everywhere!

, When you store your flour in the bag you purchased it in, it can easily become compressed and devoid of air.


Therefore, it is a good idea to transfer the flour to a large, airtight storage container as soon as you get home from the grocery store.
Once the flour is in the storage container, give it a stir with a fork or wooden spoon to incorporate some air. Alternatively, you can just give it a good shake with the lid on!
Then the next time you need flour in a recipe, you can just give the flour in the container another good stir before using."

Choose fresh green beans.,
Rinse under running water.,
Drain the water.,
Pinch the green bean near its stem.,
Snap off the stem.,
Pinch off the curled tip, if desired.,
Repeat as needed.,
Line up a handful of green beans.,
Cut away the stems.,
Trim the opposite end, if desired.,
Repeat as needed.,
French cut the green beans.,
Cut the green beans into pieces.,
Leave the green beans whole.,
Finished.Your green beans are now ready for your favorite recipe!",How to Prepare Green Beans," Fresh green beans should have long pods that are firm, plump, and crisp. Look for even green coloring.Avoid green beans with splotchy coloring or soft spots.
The shape of the green bean does not indicate freshness, but straight green beans are generally easiest to prepare.;
, Place the green beans in a large colander. Rinse them under cool, running water for approximately 60 seconds, agitating the colander slightly to expose each bean to the water.


You can also rinse the beans without a colander. Grab a handful and run them beneath cool, running water, shifting the green beans slightly in your hand as you work. Use your fingers to gently scrub away any noticeable dirt or debris.

, Place the colander over several layers of paper towel. Allow the water to drain for a few minutes, or until the beans are mostly dry.


In most cases, the beans do not need to be completely dry before you prepare them. You can gently wipe them down with clean paper towels if you do wish to dry them more thoroughly, however.

, Using your thumb and pointer finger, hold the green bean approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) away from its stem end.

, Pinch the stem end of the green bean in between the thumb and pointer finger of your opposite hand. Quickly yank the stem down toward the body of the bean, snapping it off.Most modern green beans are stringless, so this action should snap the stem tip cleanly away. If you do work with string green beans, however, you will need to continue pulling the freed tip down along the body of the bean to peel away the connected string.

, If you want to remove the curled tip opposite the stem end, hold that end of the bean with one hand and, using the fingernails of your opposite thumb and pointer finger to, pinch off the thin tip.


This step is not strictly necessary, and since it can add extra time to the process, you may wish to skip it.
If your fingernails are not sharp enough, or your finger dexterity not adequate, you may need to hold the green bean on a cutting board and use a paring knife to slice away the curl.
You can technically leave the curled tip intact. Since

, Work through the remaining green beans in the same manner. Collect the trimmed beans in a basket or other container while you work.


Note that this can be a very time-consuming process since you have to trim each bean one-by-one. For that reason, it is best to use this method only if you have a small batch of green beans or if you have plenty of time to work with.

, Grab a handful of green beans and line them up over a cutting board. Hold the beans steady with your non-dominant hand.


Make sure that the stem ends all face the same direction.
Use the palm of your hand or the flat face of a chef's knife to evenly align the stem ends of the beans with one another., Use a chef's knife to slice away the top 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so of the green beans. Start from one edge of the bean pile and work your way clear to the opposite edge, trimming off all the stem ends in one motion.Opt for a knife with a smooth, sharp blade instead of using a serrated knife.
Green beans shouldn't be too difficult to slice through, so you should not need to apply much pressure. You should, however, use even pressure while you make the cut.

, While you do not need to trim away the curled tip end of the green beans, you can do so using the same method followed for the stem ends.


It might be easiest to flip the handful of beans around before proceeding. Align the curled tip ends with one another using your hand or the edge of the knife.
Slice away about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the green beans at the curled tip end.

, While this method is quicker than the individual trimming method, you may still need to divide the green beans into several bunches.


Start by working with a handful at a time. As you grow more comfortable with this method, you can grab larger amounts.

, ""French cut"" green beans are green beans that have been trimmed and sliced into lengthwise halves.


Trim both ends using the batch method, but slice the ends off diagonally instead of slicing straight across.
Working with each individual green bean, hold the bean and use a sharp, smooth chef's knife to cut the pod straight down the middle. Repeat as needed with the remaining beans.

, If you do not wish to French cut the beans, you can cut the whole beans into strips of your desired length.


Required lengths are usually specified in individual recipes, but 1 to 2 inch (2.5 to 5 cm) pieces are fairly common, as it is versatile and can be used for many culinary purposes.
You can cut the beans in batches instead of doing so individually. Simply trim the green beans using the batch method, then cut them down to your desired length before removing your hand from the pile.Only cut the green beans crosswise; do not cut them lengthwise for this style.

, If you plan to roast the green beans or cook them as a standalone dish, you may wish to leave them whole instead of cutting them. You will still need to trim the ends off before proceeding, however.


Check the recipe, when applicable, to determine if you should or can leave the green beans whole.

, Green beans are actually delicious raw, perhaps with a ranch dip. But you may also want to consider other preparations:


Simple cooked green beans.

Fried Green Beans.

Stir fry green beans.

Sprinkle salt and pepper on the potatoes.,
Stir the potatoes every few minutes.,
Allow to cook for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until tender.",How to Prepare Red Skin Potatoes1," If desired, peel potatoes, although peeling is not necessary.;
,, The smaller the cut on the potato, the faster they will cook.

,, Here are some suggestions for things to add to sautéed potatoes:



Onions work really well with sautéed potatoes. White or yellow onions work best, although red onions can be used. Onions add a little bit of sweetness to the potatoes.

Garlic also works well, alone or in tandem with other spices. If adding chopped or minced garlic, incorporate toward the very end of cooking or the garlic will burn before the potatoes are cooked.

Herbs such as parsley, thyme, or rosemary. Thyme and rosemary together make a classic combination, while fresh parsley lightens up the heavier taste of the potatoes.

Spices such as paprika, dry mustard, or cumin. Paprika will add a little bit of heat and color; mustard adds a bit of tanginess; and cumin adds a bit of exoticism to what can be a very pedestrian dish.

, For one pound of potatoes, no more than a third-teaspoon of salt should be fine, especially if you're seasoning them with herbs and spices.

, Try to develop color on all sides of the potatoes.

, Potatoes should be soft on the inside but still have ""bite"" and crispiness on the outside.

Understand the risks.,
Chill the eggs (optional).,
Imagine a line going around the ""fattest"" part of the egg.,
Start the crack on the egg.,
Carefully break apart the shell.,
Transfer the yolk from shell to shell.,
Drop the yolk in another bowl.",How to Separate an Egg2," Many health experts in the US and Australia recommend avoiding this method, since harmful bacteria on the shell could get in contact with the egg.The risk of contamination is much lower in the EU, which has a very effective anti-salmonella program.If you're concerned about the risk, use one of the other methods instead.


Cooking yolks or whites until firm makes them much safer.If you plan to serve the eggs runny or raw, consider another separation method.

, Room temperature eggs have runnier whites, which can make this method messy and difficult. Work with eggs straight from the fridge instead.

, This is where you want to make the cleanest crack you can manage. The key with this method is to crack the egg evenly, so you can easily transfer the yolk between the two halves.

, Tap the center of the egg gently against a hard object, so a crack forms across about half of the egg. The edge of a bowl is a good surface for getting two equal halves. The edge can also break off shell fragments into your white, though, so a flat counter might be better if your eggs have thin shells., Hold the egg over a bowl in both hands with the crack facing upward and the wide end tilted down. Slowly pull apart the two halves with your thumbs, until the egg breaks into two halves. Because the egg is tilted, the yolk should fall into the lower half., ""Pour"" the intact yolk back and forth between the two halves of the shell. Repeat this about three times, while the white drips over the side of the shell and into the bowl below.

, Drop the yolk in another bowl once there are only tiny bits of white stuck to it. If you have more eggs to separate, consider using a third bowl, so a messy crack doesn't drop shell shards or broken yolk into your whites. Separate each egg over this third bowl, then empty the bowl into the other whites bowl before you move on to the next.

, The smaller the cut, the quicker the potatoes will cook.


Use a glass baking dish if possible. A glass baking dish will allow the potatoes to cook more evenly, as glass is an excellent conductor of heat.

,, Perhaps try:


3-4 cloves of garlic, whole or chopped.
1 teaspoon (1 g) dried rosemary
1 teaspoon (1 g) dried thyme
1 teaspoon (1 g) dried oregano

Rinse and peel all of the carrots you intend using.,
Use a sturdy knife to chop the carrots into small pieces.,
Place a pot on the stove with a colander in it.,
Place the carrots onto the colander or vegetable steamer, cover the pot, and steam the carrots over low to medium heat.,
Remove the heated carrots from the colander and place a handful of carrot pieces into a food processor.

,
Add about a tablespoon of water to the processor.,
Use the pureed carrots.",How to Purée Carrots," However, be aware that peeling removes a lot of nutritional content, as most of the vitamins are concentrated under the skin.
If possible, use organic carrots and simply brush the carrots under running water before using.;
, The pieces can be in small logs or slices.

, Fill the pot with about 1 or 2 inches (2.5cm-5cm) of water (or enough so that the water touches the bottom of the colander).

, Wait until the carrots are tender (test them by poking them with a tong; they should bend easily).
The steaming time should be about 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the amount of carrots, water, and heat set.

,, Blend it until you get a smooth mixture.

, Puréed carrots can be used in a variety of ways. If you intend using them for soup, dilute with the relevant liquid. If they need to be thicker, such as for use in a pie filling, thicken with a binding agent such as cornflour or potato puree or flour.

If you are making baby food, fill up an ice cube tray with the food. Wrap it with Saran wrap and place in the freezer until hard. Transfer the pieces into a container that can be placed in the freezer (Ziploc brand is a good suggestion).
When you want to use carrot blocks, take out the amount you want & put the rest back in the freezer for later use. Thaw out and heat up the pieces you want to use.

Consider preheating your oven before starting your recipe.,
Open the oven to make sure everything has been removed.,
Rearrange the rack levels, if necessary.,
Turn the oven on and set the temperature.,
Wait until the oven reaches the desired temperature.,
Place the food inside the oven and let it bake according to the recipe.",How to Preheat an Oven1," Electrical ovens often need 10 to 15 minutes before they reach the proper temperature. This is often enough time to prepare your recipe. If you need more than 15 minutes in which to prepare the food, then consider starting the oven half-way through the preparation process.;
, If you store items in your oven, such as baking trays, remove them and set them aside.

, Most oven racks are set in the middle of the oven, but sometimes, the dish that you are baking will need to be placed higher or lower in the oven. Refer to your recipe, and if necessary, take out the oven rack and set it to the right level. There should be narrow ledges on the inside walls of your oven for the rack to sit on.


Items that need to get browned and crispy at top, such as casseroles and lasagnas, are generally baked towards the top of the oven.Items such as cakes, cookies, and cupcakes should be placed in the middle rack, unless the recipe states otherwise.
Items that need to get brown and crispy at the bottom, such as flat breads and pizzas, are placed towards the bottom of the oven., To get the right temperature, you will need to refer to your recipe. The oven temperature is usually at the very beginning of the recipe, in the first step. Simply grip the dial, press down on it, and turn it until the mark lands on the right temperature.

, Most modern ovens have a setting that lets you either see the current temperature or beeps when ready. Some ovens have a little light that turns on when it is the right temperature. This light is usually next to the oven temperature dial.


Most ovens take 10 to 15 minutes to heat up to the right temperature.
If you have an older oven, you may not have a dial with the different temperatures written on it; you may just have an on-off switch. If this is the case, simply turn on the oven and wait 10 to 15 minutes before setting the items to be baked inside.Consider using an oven thermometer. Sometimes, the temperature inside the oven is not accurate and does not actually match the temperature on the dial. An oven thermometer, which is usually placed inside the oven, will tell you the actual temperature. Refer to this thermometer instead of waiting for the indicator light to go on or for the oven to beep.

, Make sure that the door is firmly closed, unless the recipe states otherwise, and do not peek inside your oven. Opening and closing the door while baking causes the internal heat to escape, which may result in longer baking times.If you plan on doing a lot of baking and using multiple racks, consider staggering the dishes and pans so that they are not parallel to each other. This will allow the hot air inside the oven to circulate around the food and distribute the heat more evenly.

Carefully crack the egg onto a shallow bowl.,
Squeeze some of the air from a clean plastic bottle.,
Pick up the yolk.,
Transfer the yolk to the other bowl.",How to Separate an Egg3," Start with one at a time, so a broken yolk doesn't ruin your whole plate. Keep a second bowl on the side for the yolks.

, Hold the bottle in this partially crumpled position.

, Place the mouth of the bottle on top of the egg yolk, and slowly release your grip. The air pressure will push the yolk into the bottle. This might take some practice; releasing too much or too quickly will pull up some of the egg whites as well., Carefully keep the bottle compressed so the yolk stays inside the bottle. Move the bottle over to the other bowl and let go to drop in the yolk.


Tilting the bottle a little may help.

Crack the egg into a funnel.,
Use a turkey baster bulb.,
Crack the egg onto a slotted spoon.,
Buy an egg separator.,
Finished.

",How to Separate an Egg4," Put the funnel into the mouth of a bottle, or have a friend hold the funnel over a bowl. Crack the egg into the funnel. The whites should pass through the small opening while the egg yolk remains in the funnel.


If the whites get stuck over the yolk, tilt the funnel so they can pass through.
This might not work well for fresh eggs, which have thick ropy sections of white.

, Unscrew the bulb from the baster handle, and you have a suction device the right size for grabbing yolks. Crack the egg onto a plate, then squeeze and let go to pull the yolk up into the baster., Shake the spoon gently side to side, then up and down, and the whites should dribble through the slots.

, You can buy a specialized tool for separating eggs from online stores, or from some kitchen supply stores. These come in two main types:


A small plastic cup surrounded by slots. Crack the egg into the cup, and rotate the separator so the egg whites fall through the slots.
A small suction device. Crack the egg onto a plate, squeeze the suction device, put it over the yolk, and release to suck up the yolk.

Cut the butter into pieces.,
Place the butter in a heavy pan or double boiler if possible.,
Heat on low.,
Watch until 3/4 of the butter has melted.,
Remove from heat and stir.,
If the recipe calls for browning, heat until specks appear.",How to Melt Butter1," Cut the butter into cubes or chunks so the heat doesn't have to melt its way slowly through the butter to reach the center. The more surface area you expose to the heat, the faster the butter will melt.


You don't need to aim for an exact size. Try cutting a stick of butter into four or five pieces.;
, A pan with a heavy base should distribute heat more evenly than thin pans. This helps minimize the chance of burning the butter, by melting every part of it at a similar rate. A double boiler is even safer. Even a light pan, however, may produce more evenly melted butter than a microwave.


You can make your own double boiler by stacking two pans.

, Butter melts between 82 and 97ºF (28–36ºC), which can be about room temperature on a hot day. Turn the heat on low to avoid heating the butter too far past this point, which can result in burning or smoking.

, The heat should remain low enough that the butter melts without browning. Use a spoon or spatula to spread the butter over the bottom of the pan as it melts.

, Turn off the heat or move to another stove burner, and stir the mostly melted butter.The butter and pan surrounding the unmelted chunks are still hot, and should be enough to melt the remaining butter. This method has a much lower risk of burning compared to leaving the butter on the stove to melt the rest of the way.


Return to the heat for thirty seconds if there are still chunks after stirring.







, You do not need to brown your butter unless the recipe specifies browned butter. If it does, keep the heat low and stir the butter continually with a gentle motion. The butter will foam, then form brown specks. Once you see these specks, remove from heat and stir until the butter turns amber brown, then pour into a room temperature dish.

Be sure to have proper ventilation.,
Open the oven the make sure there is nothing inside.,
Adjust the racks, if necessary.,
Determine whether your oven ignites with a pilot or electrically.,
If the oven uses a pilot light, turn the oven on and set the temperature.,
If the oven is digital, press broil or bake on the keypad, and set the temperature.,
When the oven reaches the right temperature, place the food inside.,
Use caution if you smell gas.",How to Preheat an Oven2," Gas ovens are fueled by gas and thus emit more fumes than electric ones. Provide proper ventilation, such as keeping a window open.

, If you store baking tins inside your oven, you will need to pull them out and set them aside.

, Some recipes will require you to change the position of the racks in your oven as doing so will determine the evenness of the baking. Refer to your recipe and adjust the racks accordingly. Simply pull them out and reinsert them into the oven. The oven should have shallow ledges inside for the racks to sit on.


Items, such as casseroles and lasagnas, need to be browned and crispy at top. They are generally placed towards the top of the oven.
Cakes, cookies, and cupcakes need to be baked evenly, and are usually placed in the middle rack, unless the recipe states otherwise.
Items, such as flat breads and pizzas, need to get brown and crispy at the bottom. They are usually baked in the bottom level of the oven.

, How your oven ignites will determine how you turn it on and set the temperature. Most older stoves will use a pilot light, while newer ones will rely on electricity to ignite. Here is how you can determine what sort of ignition your oven has:


If your oven has a pilot-based ignition, you may notice a constantly burning flame that increases or decreases in size depending on the temperature
If your oven has an electric-based ignition, you will not see the flames until you turn on the oven and set the temperature.

, You may have to press on the dial lightly before turning it.


If the oven uses gas marks instead of Celsius or Fahrenheit, you will need to convert the mark. You will need to go on the internet and use an online conversion tool.
Sometimes, the pilot light goes out or needs to be ignited before each use. If this happens, make sure that the temperature dials are set to ""off"" and locate the pilot light. Light a match and hold the flame next to the pilot hole. If the pilot light ignites, remove the match. If the pilot light does not ignite, turn the temperature up slightly., Use the up and down arrows on the pad to adjust the temperature. Once you have set the temperature, hit ""Start."" The numbers on the screen will change—this is the current temperature inside the oven. Wait as the temperature rises and reaches the original temperature you set., Gas ovens heat up much faster than electric ones, so your oven should reach the proper temperature in 5 to 10 minutes.


Keep the oven door closed, unless the recipe states otherwise. Do not open the oven door and peek at your food, as this will cause the heat inside the oven to escape and prolong baking times.
If you have a lot of baking to do and are planning on both racks, do not put too many dishes on the bottom rack. This may prevent the heat from reaching the food on the upper rack.

, If you smell gas while baking, you may have a gas leak.Turn the oven off immediately. Do NOT use any electrical appliances. Doing so may cause an explosion. Open a window and evacuate the house. Contact emergency services using either a neighbor's phone or a cell phone. Do not use your cellphone inside the house."

Keep the altitude in mind.,
Increase the baking temperature.,
Decrease the baking time.,
Place the food closer to the heat source.",How to Preheat an Oven3," High-altitudes will impact the baking time, temperature, and even the ingredients. Most recipes were not designed for high-altitudes and will need adjustments. If you are at 3,000 feet (914.4 meters) or higher, you will need to adjust your recipe.

, When you turn on your oven, you will need to set the temperature higher than what is stated in the recipe. If you are at 3,000 feet (914.4 meters) or higher, you will need to increase your baking temperature by 15°F to 25°F (9°C to 14°C)If you are between 7,000 feet and 9,000 feet (2133.6 meters to 2743.2 meters), consider increasing the baking time instead.If you are at 9,000 feet (2743.2 meters) and higher, increase the temperature stated in the recipe by 25°F (14°C). Then, as soon as you place your food inside the oven, lower the temperature back to the temperature stated in the recipe., Since you are increasing the temperature, your items will be finished sooner than what is stated in the recipe. For every 6 minutes of baking time stated in the recipe, decrease your baking time by 1 minute.


For example, if your recipe needs to be baked for every 30 minutes, decrease the baking time, and bake for 25 minutes instead.

, Most ovens are warmer towards the bottom, and this is where you should consider placing your dishes to ensure that they get cooked properly."

Alternately, you can forgo the chopsticks and use tongs instead.;
, You want a fairly large flame to ensure the quickest roasting time and sufficient blackening. Lower temperatures will require more gas and time to roast the peppers. You may want to line the stovetop with aluminum foil before lighting the flame, as this procedure can get messy.

,, These noises simply tell you the skin is cracking and that the peppers are roasting. This is a good sign.

, You should rotate the peppers so that the entire surface is black and crispy. Don’t worry about that pitch black color. The flesh underneath will be perfectly fine.

, There are several ways you can proceed to cool the peppers.
Put them in a paper bag and close it. This will steam the peppers and aid in removing the skins. You can also place the peppers in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap, or seal in a zip-top freezer bag, or put into a saucepan with the lid on.






Alternatively, plunge them immediately into an ice water bath. The ice water will stop the cooking process and facilitate the removal of the peppers’ skins. This method, however, is more likely to pull flavor out of the peppers.







, Once all the skin is off, place peppers on a cutting board.

, Scrape off the white membrane and seeds and discard. This can also be done by hand under running water.

Cut the butter into chunks.,
Cover the dish of butter with a paper towel.,
Heat the butter for ten seconds on low or defrost.,
Stir and check progress.,
Repeat the process until the butter is mostly melted.,
Stir to melt remaining pieces.",How to Melt Butter2," The microwave will heat the butter from the outside in, so chop the butter into several pieces to increase the surface area that can be heated. This will reduce uneven heating, although you still shouldn't expect perfectly even heating in a microwave.

, Place the butter into a microwave-safe dish, then cover with a paper towel. Butter may splatter during the rapid melting a microwave causes. The paper towel should protect the microwave’s interior from these splashes.

, Microwave ovens are much faster at melting butter than the stovetop, but also much more likely to cause burning, separation, or other problems. Start out cautiously by setting the microwave to ""low"" or ""defrost"" if possible, then microwave your butter for ten seconds.

, The butter has most likely not melted by now, but because butter melts at a relatively low temperature, each ten second interval can have a dramatic effect. Stir to evenly distribute the heat and see if there are any chunks.



Note: remember to remove silverware from the bowl before returning it to the microwave.

, Replace the paper towel and zap the butter for another ten seconds, or five seconds if the butter is nearly done. Keep checking on progress until there are only tiny chunks remaining. Remove the dish carefully from the microwave, as it may be hot.

, The tiny pieces remaining can be melted with the residual heat. Stir the butter until the entire dish is golden and liquid.


Butter with greasy droplets or white residue on the surface has been microwaved too long. It can still be used for sautéing  or adding flavor to savory dishes, but may negatively affect the texture of baked goods."

Know how to tell when butter is soft.,
Cut butter into pieces before softening.,
Leave butter on the counter near the oven.,
Soften butter more quickly by mashing or beating it.,
Place a container of butter in a warm water bath.,
Rapidly soften frozen butter by grating it.",How to Melt Butter3," Unless a recipe gives you a specific description of texture, butter is considered soft when it's about room temperature. It can easily be squished by a spoon, but still keeps its shape when left alone.

, There are several common methods of softening butter described below. For any of these methods, however, the butter will soften more quickly if cut into small cubes first.

, If the butter isn't frozen and the room is warm, small pieces of butter may only take a few minutes to soften. This is especially easy if you have the oven on nearby, or if the oven's top tends to stay warm constantly due to a pilot light.


Do not place the butter directly on top of a warm oven, unless it is frozen. Keep an eye on butter in hot places to make sure it doesn't melt, as this can happen rapidly.

, To speed up the softening process, use electric mixer, or use this tip to easily mash the butter by hand. Stick the butter in a sealed zip lock bag with most of the air squeezed out. Using a rolling pin, your hands, or any heavy object, roll or mash the butter repeatedly.After a few minutes, the butter should feel significantly softer, without any signs of melting.


Instead of a zip lock bag, you could put the butter between two sheets of parchment paper or wax paper.

, Fill a large bowl partway full of warm water, avoiding steaming hot water. Put the butter in a sealed zip lock bag or in a smaller bowl resting in the water bath. Keep a close eye on the butter and poke it occasionally to check the texture, as this method should only take a couple minutes to soften refrigerated butter., If you can't wait for frozen butter to thaw, grate it using a coarse, large-hole grater. The grated shreds of butter should thaw and soften within a few minutes in a warm room."

Trim your meat.,
Add your ingredients.,
Let the meat soak.",How to Marinate a Pot Roast2," Select a bag large enough to fit your cut of meat when sliced in half. If you are reusing a previously used bag (or if you are simply extra cautious), check the bag for any holes to avoid leaks., Ensure that you won’t have to clean your fridge after marinating your meat. Choose a tray, dish, or any other container whose sides will easily fit your bag. Set the bag inside so the dish catches any leaks, just in case the bag is somehow punctured later on., Set your meat on a cutting board. Slice away any extra fat along its surface. Then slice it in half.Use a long-pronged fork to poke holes in both halves so the marinade can penetrate further in more easily., Insert your meat into the bag and then pour your marinade over it.Or, do the opposite and pour the marinade in first.Whichever you prefer.

, Once your meat and marinade are both in the bag, seal it shut. Lay the meat flat inside the dish so as much surface area as possible can soak in the liquid. Transfer the dish to your refrigerator. Let the meat soak anywhere from 8 to 24 hours before cooking. Flip it over periodically during that time so both sides are evenly soaked for consistent flavoring."

Then rub in a half-teaspoon (2.5 grams) of salt and pepper respectively., Set the burner under the saucepan to medium-high heat. Once the wine begins to boil, lower the heat to simmer. Leave uncovered for about a quarter of an hour, or until the wine reduces to approximately 1.5 cups (354.9 ml), or roughly half of its original volume., Pour about 1.33 cups (314.7 ml) of beef broth into the reduced wine, followed by a ¼ cup (59.1 ml) of tomato paste. Then stir in 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of Dijon mustard; 1 tablespoon (15 g) of herbes de Provence, four minced cloves of garlic, and two bay leaves. Continue to simmer for another five minutes., Place your meat in your crockpot or Dutch oven. Pour your new wine sauce over it. Cover your crockpot and set it to low heat and cook for eight to ten hours.For a Dutch oven, preheat your stove’s oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 Celsius), cover your Dutch oven, and then bake for three and a half hours., To speed things along, start cooking your meat before reducing the wine. Line the bottom of your crockpot or Dutch oven with olive oil. Transfer the meat into the pot or oven and begin cooking. Set the heat to low for a crockpot, or medium for a Dutch oven. Turn the meat over periodically so that each side browns evenly in the cooking oil.,"
