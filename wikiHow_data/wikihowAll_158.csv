Check your unofficial transcript before ordering an official transcript.,
Use the university website to order official transcripts.,
Upload any additional documents.,
Pay the transcript request fee.",How to Request Official Transcripts1," This can be done through your university’s website. Go over your unofficial transcript to make sure that all of your grades, accolades, and the classes listed are correct.


The information on your unofficial transcript will be reproduced on your official transcript. If you receive your official transcript and there is an error, it will take time and money to correct the mistake.
Make sure your most recent information is on the transcript. If you have just recently graduated, or will be graduating shortly, your most recent grades should still be on your official transcript, so long as the professor has turned them in on time.
Double check that your grades are correct. Go over each grade on your unofficial transcript and make sure that they match the grades that you know you received for each class.;
, You will need your student ID as well as your user ID and password for your online university profile to order your transcript. Go to your university’s website, type in your information, and look in the enrollment and admissions section to order official transcripts.


If you forgot your ID or password, click on the applicable “forgot my password” option and follow the steps listed. If you do not have an ID or password, you may have to print out the request form and mail it in or bring it in person to the enrollment office.
In general, most universities require two to three working days to process official transcript requests after receiving the request in the transcript or records office. However, this period of time may be longer if you request your transcript close to the end of the semester.

, If you require additional documents for applications for the Law School Admission Council (LSAC), the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS), or the Pharmacy College Application Service(PHARMCAS), complete them and upload them to the online transcript request. You may need to scan the original documents to then upload them., During the online ordering process, you will need to pay the fee for the transcripts, usually around $10-$15 per transcript.


You can pay this fee by credit, PayPal, or through your student account.

Choose a fruit that is free of pesticides, dyes, and wax (since you will be eating the outer peel).,
Wash and dry the fruit thoroughly, whether it is organic or not.,
Hold the zester in your hand, much like a vegetable peeler, while applying pressure to the fruit.,
Adopt the same basic technique if using a microplane.,
Try the old-fashioned method for grating zest.,
Freeze the zest.,
Alternatively, dry the zest.,
Store the dried zest it in a sealed jar in a cool, dry place.

",How to Prepare Fresh Citrus Fruit Peel," If at all possible, start with an organic orange, lemon, or other citrus fruit. While some authorities recommend the use of organic citrus fruit, it is difficult to find. Thoroughly washing and drying the fruit should make the fruit safe to eat. If there is a concern, shop for organic citrus fruit.;
, Cut out any discolorations or bad spots.

, Pull the the zester across the surface and the zest will appear.

, A microplane is like a grater. Pull it across the fruit to separate the zest.

, If you do not have a zester or microplane, take a vegetable peeler and peel the citrus rind. Once the peel is removed, finely mince the zest using a knife. The food processor can also mince the peel, if a food processor is available.

, Once the citrus fruit peel has been zested, freeze it in small freezer storage bags or containers. The zest is available for later cooking.

, Spread it in a single layer on a plate or waxed paper and leave it exposed to the air until it is dry enough to be brittle (a couple of days).

Socialize frequently.,
Bond with your flatmates.,
Don't let going out consume you or your money.,
Lock your food and utensils away.,
Develop a sensible coping strategy.,
Don't leave all your work until the last minute.,
Don't turn nocturnal.,
Don't be afraid to bring up an issue or ask for help.",How to Survive Your First Year at University," One thing you will learn through university if you haven't already is that friends won't necessarily come looking for you. Engage with people, converse, ask questions. Do this within reason, of course. If you take an interest in people, people will take an interest in you. It is best to start this in Freshers' Week when everyone is in the same boat and is actively looking for people to be friends with and go out with.;
, This doesn't mean you have to be best mates with them, but bear in mind that you are together almost 24/7 and share a kitchen/common wall. Being on bad terms with flatmates brings your whole flat down, so do your best, even if you're not that fond of them, to include yourself and them in activities such as going out, shopping, going to the gym, etc. There will be times when you will be angry at one flatmates for leaving your milk out, or another for not washing up your bowl they just used, but being in their good books can prove beneficial.

, You're a university student, of course you want to go out! But bear in mind that finances are a factor, and the bars won't disappear. As cheap as drinks in student cities might seem, all of these purchases add up and you risk racking up a debt, or perhaps not being able to afford those necessary purchases such as food and paying bills. Drinking may be a well-known student activity, but be aware of others available to you, such as the gym, societies, and club meetings.

, This may seem a bit extreme, but in my experience, it's for the best. Just remember that most of the time your flatmates won't take your food maliciously, it'll most likely be that they've just run out of milk for their tea and decide to pop a bit of yours in, or someone came home very hungover and spotted your mum's delicious lasagna unguarded in the fridge. In a lot of universities they've anticipated this problem and cupboards come with holes for locks on the doors. By locking your food and utensils away, you save food, money, time, energy, and washing-up.

, Most people that are about to go to University fall into three categories: 1) they can't wait to get away from their parents, 2) they're dreading the day they leave the comfort of their own home, and 3) nervous but excited. All of these are perfectly normal and acceptable feelings. Chances are that you will from time-to-time become homesick, especially if something negative happens, such as stress from too much work, a falling-out with a friend, or worries over money. Remember that your parents will be thinking about you as well, and will be more than happy to talk to you should need any help or advice. Some may find phoning/visiting home regularly more therapeutic in helping them cope away from home, whereas others may find limited contact stops them from feeling homesick. Formulate a sensible strategy that suits you and helps you stay productive and happy. Most of all, make sure to keep yourself occupied.

, This may seem very tempting seeing as you will have longer deadlines, sometimes a couple of months at a time, and longer holidays (again sometimes months at a time), but the deadline will soon creep up on you. A very useful strategy, albeit a slightly boring one, is to get your work done as soon as you get it, or as soon as possible afterwards; this way, your note are still fresh in your mind and you will have more time for play after finishing work, and will not have that niggling thought in the back of your head about that essay you really should have started a week ago.

, This is also very tempting seeing as you won't have a parent nagging you to go to bed at a reasonable hour. By all means you should set your own bedtime, but getting to the stage where you are going to sleep at 6am and waking up at 4pm is getting a bit too ridiculous. University is fun but difficult; give your body the rest it needs and the rest will follow.

, University is different in very many ways to school and college. The learning styles are different, the work is harder and you are expected to handle your own learning. In fact, you learn independently a lot more than being lecturer-led. Lecturers will understand that adjusting to things like this take time and patience - so if you don't understand something, ask them. It won't make you look stupid or like you weren't listening - in fact, you'll be the smarter one for making sure you know exactly what's expected of you and how to do it than your classmate who decided to fall asleep during said lecture and not follow it up.

Request PDF transcripts for quick and easy access by the recipients.,
Confirm the recipients have received the PDF transcripts.,
Ask for paper transcripts by mail or by FedEx.,
Contact your institution if the transcripts do not arrive on time.",How to Request Official Transcripts4," Most institutions will offer to send PDF versions of your official transcripts to your recipients. These are sent over a secure network to the email address of the recipient. The PDF transcripts are considered official documents and are secured with a digital signature.To order PDF versions and have them sent to the recipients, you will need to provide the recipients’ email addresses, and verify that the recipients will accept an electronic transcript before you send them PDF transcripts.
The recipient will need to use an access code to view the PDF transcripts. The transcript may also contain a warning that the document is intended for the recipient’s use only and is considered a confidential document.
The cost for PDF transcripts are the same as paper transcripts (around $10-$15 per transcript).

, Once the recipient receives and downloads the PDF transcript, you should get a confirmation email. If possible, send the recipients a brief email telling them they should expect an email from the university with the transcripts attached to ensure the PDF transcripts do not end up in their junk folder.Most institutions put a limit on how long the recipient has to access the PDF transcript, usually up to 30 days. If the recipient does not download the PDF transcript after several weeks, they should receive a reminder email prior to the expiration date.

, Receiving transcripts by regular post can take five to seven business days, so you may want to consider getting a FedEx delivery if you need the transcripts within two to three days of your request. Most institutions will offer FedEx delivery of official transcripts for a flat fee anywhere in the United States. This fee may be $10 for the transcript and $20 for the FedEx shipping.If you choose FedEx delivery, your transcripts will be prepared and sent out on the next business day. So, if you requested the transcripts on a Monday night, they will be processed and prepared Tuesday, to be delivered on Wednesday.

, If your transcripts do not arrive at their destination within five to seven days, call your university’s enrollment office or go the office in person.


If you are expecting the transcripts by mail, they should have a tracking number that can locate the transcripts to determine why you have not yet received them.

By going to conferences, you will also have deadlines to help keep you motivated.Try to attend a few conferences every year and remember to add these presentations to your CV.
Most departments offer travel funds to help pay some of your costs. Check with your department well before the conference date to find out what you need to do to obtain these funds.
You can also apply for special awards that are available to conference attendees. Even if you think you might not win, apply for these awards. If you win one, then it will look great on your CV.
You might also consider volunteering to help out at a conference to help defer some of your costs.;
, Graduate school is a rare opportunity to connect with some of the most established people in your field. This is where you’ll build professional connections that will likely have a huge influence on the rest of your career.Professors might seem intimidating, but remember that all of them were once in your shoes.
Academics have busy lives. If a professor or guest is usually too busy to make time for you, stick it out. Make it clear that you will do whatever’s necessary to connect with them. You can volunteer to assist on an upcoming project, or to help set up for next week’s guest lecture.

, As a student, you have access to all kinds of activities and learning opportunities. These are not just great ways to learn about your area of study, but also to make connections.If a specific guest lecture fascinated you, stay after and talk to the speaker. They may want to talk to you about their research or know of other opportunities for you.
Attending regular activities and meetings shows that you’re engaged. When opportunities come up in the department, your professors are likely to offer them to the students they most often see around.

, Unlike undergraduate programs, in graduate school, students are treated like adults. That means that if you’re interested in studying outside the department, pursuing a research project, or need financial aid, you need to seek those things out on your own. No one is going to regularly check up on you to make sure you’re on top of things.Get to know your department’s administrative assistants and secretaries. These are the people who can help you navigate all of the university’s red tape.
Ask questions! Don’t be shy if you don’t understand a policy. Remember that you’re not expected to know how everything works right off the bat.

, Hopefully, you’ve done some research about the professors before you committed to the program. There should be at least one professor in your department whom you feel you can connect with about your field of study.Even if a professor is your favorite teacher or scholar, they might not make a good advisor. For example, a successful scholar may be too busy and absent to be a committed advisor.
A good advisor should be available to talk to you about your research and your process. The person should be someone you feel comfortable approaching and being honest with if you're struggling. The person should also be someone whose work you respect and who respects your work.

, There’s always lots to do to make a graduate department run. Offer to help out when you can. It’s a great way to make friends and show the professors that you’re engaged and energetic.If you hear of an upcoming event, such as a symposium or a visiting scholar, offer to help. Mention to your professor or the office manager that you’d love to help with setup, or picking up the guest scholar if needed.

, Some people enter graduate school with the feeling that they’re competing with their classmates. On the contrary, your classmates are your current (and future) colleagues.Many people move far from home to attend graduate school, so they're probably in need of new friends at school.
Join an on-campus club. It can be a great way to meet other students, particularly if your department is small.
Joining a reading group can be a way to connect with others while advancing your own research.

, Graduate school requires excellent research skills, which means using the library and not simply performing internet searches. If you did not take advantage of the library’s resources as an undergraduate, then now is the time to start. Familiarize yourself with your library’s resources, such as interlibrary loan and special databases.


Also, find out who the subject-area librarian is for your discipline. Most university libraries have librarians who curate a special set of databases for each discipline.
For example, your university might have a librarian who is in charge of psychology databases. If you are working on a graduate degree in psychology, then this librarian would be a valuable resource for you when you are doing research.Consider introducing yourself to your subject librarian and get his or her contact information, such as an email address or phone number.

, In graduate school, you’ll need to do a lot of reading. Even if you read a lot in your undergraduate work, your new workload is likely to be much heavier. Prepare yourself by learning how to read selectively and with your research in mind.Look closely at the chapter headings of books. Read what is directly relevant to your studies and keep asking yourself why you’re reading a given piece. If you can’t figure it out, stop and reassess if you should keep reading.
If you know you'll have papers due, or are working on a dissertation, keep that in mind. Make notes or mark pages that may be of use to you with those projects.

, This can be a tough one. However, time management is key for surviving the rigors of graduate school. Keep a calendar and a to-do list in a visible place. Learn how much time it takes you to read an article or perform an experiment.Overestimate how much time you need to complete any task. If you think a paper will take you one week to complete, begin it two weeks before you must have it completed. Especially when preparing for a big event such as your defense or a presentation, give yourself plenty of time.
Stay accountable by having a buddy. Tell a friend or family member about your deadlines and projects. They can call you to make sure you’re working steadily instead of putting things off until the last minute.

, Graduate school can present almost too many opportunities. This is the time to take them. If a professor is leading a fieldwork trip abroad, or a visiting lecturer is offering a weekend long master class, try to sign up. You won’t have many opportunities like this once you’re done with school.Take opportunities that you’re genuinely interested in, not just the ones that carry the most prestige.
Opportunities may come with funding, or you may be able to get external funding to pursue certain research activities.

, Anyone who’s written a dissertation will tell you that organization is key to success. Find a method that works for you, and use it.Some people like to keep everything in files on their computers, for others, they need to have physical notes and files that they can hold in their hands.
Dedicate a space (a desk, drawer, wall, computer folder, or filing cabinet) to your studies. Use that to store every piece of research you find that’s relevant to your work.

, You’ve decided to pursue graduate school, which means that on some level you’ve accepted the amount of work ahead of you. Even if you get tired sometimes, remember that this is a unique opportunity and you’ll be grateful that you made the most of it.Push yourself to excel in your coursework as well as independent research. You've made the choice to go to grad school, so choose to give your classes your all.
Pushing yourself is great, but don’t push too hard. Graduate school is not worth making yourself miserable over. If the stress is too great, you should see a therapist or counselor.

, It is easy for your graduate school work to follow you home and bleed into your personal time, which can affect your quality of life. To avoid this, try to set some boundaries for yourself and stick to them.


For example, you could create a cutoff time for yourself, so that you do not end up working all of the time. You could plan to work on graduate school assignments from 1pm to 7pm every day and then put away the books and do something fun.
If you find it hard to put away your work when you are at home, then you might also consider leaving them at school. You could set a physical boundary for your work by only doing graduate school work on campus, such as in your office or in the library.
Setting boundaries is especially important if you have a significant other and/or children. If you are constantly doing school work when you are around them, then it may begin to cause problems.

, Just because you’re in graduate school doesn’t mean you can’t still enjoy yourself sometimes. Choose the activities or hobbies that are meaningful to you and dedicate some time to them.Use school breaks to enjoy time off. Go on a vacation if you can. If staying home, take some time to read simply for pleasure. Spend some time away from your research.
Look at your calendar and write in times for fun. Sometimes, if you don’t schedule the fun in, it’s easy to let it fall by the wayside.

, Graduate school can take a toll on romantic relationships and on friendships. However, you want to make sure that those things remain intact through graduation. Don’t let graduate school come between you and the people in your life.Be honest with your significant other, friends, and family members. Let them know how rigorous your program is and what will be required of you. Also let them know what kinds of commitments you’re able to make to nurture your relationships.
Stick to your commitments. If you promised a friend that you’d be at their birthday party, honor that commitment. Do whatever work you need to do ahead of time to make that possible.
Spend time with your children. If you have kids, make sure you are taking time to be fully present with them. Chances are, you’ll feel more refreshed when you go back to work or study after some quality family time.

, Almost all universities offer free counseling services. Even if you’ve never been to counseling before, you might find it very helpful while in graduate school. A counselor can help you with developing time management skills or figuring out if your program is right for you.There may be therapy groups on your campus that would be a good fit for you.
If your university doesn’t offer counseling, you can ask at the health center if they could give you a referral.

, This may sound impossible given your academic schedule, but getting enough sleep is essential. Getting enough sleep helps you be more alert during the day so that you can focus on your studies.Stimulants such as caffeine can hinder restful sleep. They may seem like useful study aids, but make sure they’re not preventing you from sleeping.

Power naps during the day can be a great way to boost your energy level.

, As a graduate student, chances are you’ll be living on a tight budget. Create a monthly budget based on any loans, assistantships, or fellowships you have. Compare this amount to your known expenses.For example, if your monthly income averages $1,000, you may need to find a living space for about $350. That would leave you $250 for bills such as utilities, a phone plan, and car insurance, and $600 (approximately $20 per day) for expenses such as food and incidentals.

, There may be fellowships or scholarships available to you. Ask the administrative assistant in your department for recommendations. Apply for everything you are eligible for. You might be surprised at which funding you actually get.There may be funding sources outside of your institution as well.

, Any work outside of school can feel like a distraction from your studies. Try to find something that feels relevant to your research. This could be tutoring in a similar subject or working in a laboratory doing related work.Make sure your job will not take up too much of your time. Remember that graduate school is still your priority.
You may prefer to get a job completely unrelated to your studies. This can sometimes be a welcome break from always focusing on academia. A low-stress job such as dog-walking or working at a coffee shop can sometimes help your brain relax.

, There are special tax breaks available to some graduate students such as the Lifetime Learning Credit. Ask your financial aid officer for advice, or seek out help from a professional accountant.You can also write off some of your graduate school expenses on your taxes, such as student loan interest payments, books, school supplies, and transportation costs., If you’ve taken out loans, start planning now for how you will repay them. You may not have a job lined up, but you can begin to think about what your budget will look like once you’re one with school.Federal loans can sometimes be deferred for up to three years.
Your loans may be eligible for income-based repayment plans.
Some professions in the nonprofit or government sector make you eligible for loan forgiveness.

Don’t get too drunk.,
Watch out for your friends.,
Always stop at Canyon Pizza on the way home.,
Have fun.",How to Survive Your Freshman Year at Penn State," Getting to know new people is the best way to fit in at a university as large as Penn State. Having a large circle of friends makes the campus seem just a little bit smaller. Getting to know the people in your dorm is a great way to find people to walk to class with, have dinner with, or just hang out with.;
, The more activities you are involved in, the more people you will know (or at least the more faces you will recognize). It’s not necessarily important to remember everyone’s name, but it is nice and comforting to be able to wave to a familiar face when walking to class. By getting involved you are also making a small difference here at Penn State, which can give you a great sense of accomplishment.

, Getting behind on your work is one of the worst things to do. It only leads to putting it off even more, and then it takes longer to get caught up. Whether you are doing the work as soon as class is over, or right before it begins, get it done. No one likes the feeling of walking into an exam, completely unprepared, knowing that you have no chance of passing.

, Worrying about work can lead to nothing good. Do the work you need to do to get the grades you want to get, but don’t stress out over it. Studying for too long seems to make the test seem harder. Be prepared, but don’t waste your life away at Penn State by being locked up in your room studying all the time.

, Going out is by far the best way to meet new people. It’s nice to be able to go to a place you have never been before, grab a beer, and hit the dance floor. If you look like you’re enjoying yourself, it’s easier for other people to approach you. By going out more, people will start to recognize you, and you will definitely enjoy yourself more.

, I’m not saying get wasted, but loosen up a little bit. Even if that may take a little liquor, make sure you are having fun. Take advantage of the free drinks while you can get them, because they are not going to last for long. Get to know the bartender; if you remember his name, he’s a lot more likely to give you a drink.

, No one likes the kid at the party who is puking over the balcony or in the bathroom. You don’t want to have to be someone else’s responsibility. Know your limits, and definitely respect them. You also don’t want to be meeting up with any police on your long walk home, where ever that may be.

, Friends are important; you watch out for them, and they watch out for you. Don’t let them make stupid decisions they are going to regret in the morning after they have sobered up a little bit. I am sure you would want them to do the same for you.

, Not only is the pizza amazing, but the people are too. Meeting people in line is another great way to enjoy your night. The pizza is great, but the experience of waiting in line is unforgettable. Plus, it’s only a dollar a slice.

, You only attend Penn State once, so you might as well live it up while you are here. As the saying goes, “You have four years to be irresponsible here. Relax. Work is for people with jobs. You'll never remember class time, but you'll remember the time you wasted hanging out with your friends. So, stay out late. Go out on a Tuesday with your friends when you have a paper due Wednesday. Spend money you don't have. Drink till sunrise. The work never ends but college does.�?

Research potential activities or destinations.,
Create a budget for your year.,
Work during your gap year.,
Save money for your gap year.,
Ask your family for money.,
Reflect on your goals.,

Travel to different places to broaden your perspective.",How to Take a Gap Year," While the concept of the gap year is increasingly popular, it’s been around for a while and many people have taken gap years. Make sure to draw on the wealth of experience that other people have gained during their gap years.


Read books or magazine articles about the idea of the gap year. Consider books like The Complete Guide to the Gap Year.

Consult friends or acquaintances who have taken a gap year or are planning on taking a gap year. These people will be able to provide you with a wealth of information about many things you might not have thought about.;
, Before moving forward and choosing a destination, you need to reflect on your priorities for your gap year. Ask yourself:


Do you want to be near friends or family?
Do you want to live in a remote destination?
Do you want to immerse yourself in a new language and a new culture?
Do you want to practical experience?

, After you’ve learned about what people typically do on a gap year, spend a little time putting together a list of things you want to consider doing. When making your list, consider:


Places to go and spend time. You may have dreamed of visiting Europe.
People you want to meet. You may be interested in meeting people who are culturally different than yourself.
Things you want to experience or skills you want to develop. For instance, you might want to spend time developing your outdoor skill or practical skills. You could spend part of your gap year volunteering a summer camp or working for AmeriCorps., Devote some time to researching potential activities or destinations on your list. Spend most time on those activities or destinations you are most interested in. You’ll find that you will learn a lot through this process.


Take your top ten activities or destinations and research them.
Rank them in order of how interested you are in them.
After finishing your research, re-rank them. Don’t be afraid to move items up or down based on what you’ve learned.
Take the top three items and take some time to reflect on them. Talk with family or friends to get their opinion.
Pick the one that is most feasible and that you are most interested in., Your first step in planning your gap year is to create a budget. Without a budget, you won’t know what is within the realm of possibilities and how you’ll make your gap year plans come to fruition.


Estimate travel expenses. Be realistic and make sure to build in 10% to 20% extra for unexpected travel costs. This money could cover the cost of extra bus, train, or plane tickets. Use popular travel websites like Travelocity or Expedia for quotes.
Estimate lodging costs. Take some time to investigate whatever lodging you’ll need on your gap year. Depending on your choices, this could be the cost of hostels, Airbnb, short-term rentals, or more. Use websites like Craigslist, Hotels.com, Airbnb, and other websites to get quotes for housing.
Estimate the cost of food. Depending on where you spend your gap year, the cost of food expenses will vary. Use internet search engines to google the country or region you’ll live in and to estimate the cost of food. Try to figure a daily cost, rather than weekly or monthly, as it will be more accurate and easier to track.
Figure out how much you may spend on recreation
Build in a 10% to 20% cushion for unexpected expenses.
Based on your total estimated cost, you’ll either have to adjust expectations or change your plans (perhaps to a lower cost region), or try to acquire funds to cover your cost., Many people increasingly choose to work during their gap year. This not only has the benefit of giving you a relatively stress-free time to earn money and gain experience, but it provides time for you to learn about yourself before enrolling in college. If you choose to work during your gap year, your financing problems will be a little different.


Many people decide to work odd jobs as they backpack across Europe or North America. Chances are, with some research, you’ll be able to line up jobs in different locations.
Choose a fun gap year location that is tied to a job that will pay your costs. Some activities might include being a ranch hand, being a whitewater rafting guide, or working at a lodge in the mountains.
Consider spending your gap year as a paid intern or apprentice for a job you may be interested in after college. This way, you’ll earn money, experience, and learn whether you want to pursue that particular career path., One option many people choose to take is to save money for their gap year as they finish high school or over the summer. This way, they'll have the money reader when they want to start their gap year.


Work a part time job while you are in high school or during summers. Secure a job at a fast food franchise, mowing lawns around your neighborhood, or babysitting young children. Make sure to save as much money as you can.
Put time aside after graduation to work. If you don’t have enough money from your part time job you worked during high school, you might consider setting aside some time immediately after graduation to work full time to finance your gap year., One way to finance your gap year is to ask whether your family will finance it. While this may seem like a hard sell, there are several arguments you can make to improve the odds of getting money from your family.


Provide evidence of the beneficial nature of gap years. For instance, have them visit the CIEE.org website to see statistics about how gap years promote career and academic success.
Explain how it will help you grow as a person. Consider saying: ""My gap year will help me become more responsible and independent -- something I admit I need to work on.""
Let them know how a gap year will better prepare you for college or work. Consider saying: ""My gap year will give me time to reflect on what my true interests are. After all, I have very few real world experiences and need perspective before I decide what I want to do in life."", Before and while you take your gap year, you need to spend some time reflecting on your goals. This could be your goals in life or your goals for your gap year. Ultimately, determining your goals will help you better conceptualize, articulate, and experience your gap year. Consider:


Whether you want to grow as a person.
What your long term goals are. Do you want to devote your life to business, to family, or to philanthropy?
What are your short term goals. Where do you want to be in one, three, or five years? Think about this in terms of career or family life.
Whether you want to see and experience things you may not be able to do at any other time. For instance, after you enroll and then graduate from college, you may never be able to hike the entire Appalachian trail from Georgia to Maine., Perhaps the most important element of finding yourself during your gap year is to spend it doing things and visiting places that interest you.


If you're fascinated with nature and the environment, find an internship or a job in which you can spend your time exploring that interest.
Don’t feel pressured to spend your gap year doing something that your parents, guardians, or others think will be good for you. However, make sure to listen attentively to anyone who does give you advice – especially others who have taken gap years.
Avoid giving in to peer pressure. You may be tempted to spend your gap year with friends doing something that your social group thinks is hip and trendy. When it comes to evaluating this, you need to listen to your inner voice and let it guide you. If you think your friends' idea of a cool gap year is a bad idea, let them know that you support them but will do something else. For instance, say something like ""I think I will be more fulfilled doing something different."", An important part of finding yourself during your gap year is to experience a wide variety of things that are dramatically different than what you’ve already experienced. By visiting far-flung places, meeting new people, and seeing new sights, you’ll widen your perspective and gain a broader understanding of your place in the world.


Consider a place you’ve never been but that fascinates you. For example, you may choose to spend your gap year in the Australian outback, China, or the desert Southwest of the United States.
Think about a place you’ve visited and might want to attend college or live. For instance, if you’re from New England, the Mountain West might fascinate you.
Reflect on spending your gap year traveling nonstop from region to region and form country to country. You may be able to expand your worldview – and better find yourself – after experiencing places vastly different than ones you know."

, Use it to plan ahead. Big assignments are easier if you work on them a little at a time, as opposed to being ""surprised"" into cramming all the work into the night before class.

, Studying or other activities may be important, but not more important than getting enough uninterrupted sleep. If you just have to go without, have a cup of coffee and exercise for about ten of twenty minutes before you go to work (or class). That should wake you up enough to get through the day.

Consider how you will pay rent, utilities, and living expenses.,
Have a checking account, if you do not have one already.,
Find roommates.,
Find a living situation.,
Have a Roommate Agreement.,
Understand your rights and responsibilities as a renter.",How to Transition from a Dorm to Off Campus Housing," Living off-campus will mean having to keep track of expenses you have not before. Even if your parents or other funding source will pay your way, you will likely need to get a sense of what living costs will be. Asking others who live off campus can be helpful. Items to research will likely include:


Rent: This will include (at least in many areas) a security deposit of first and perhaps last month's rent, plus the monthly rent.
Utilities: Electricity, gas, water, trash, snow plowing, etc.
Food: Even if you eat meals on-campus, you will usually have to go grocery shopping or budget for ""take-out"" meals, stopping by the coffee shop, parties, and so on.
Transportation: This may mean car, gas, insurance, maintenance, tolls, taxi fare, bus fare, or the like.
Laundry: Well, at least some things never change!
Other expenses: If you do not have household items like a bed, pots and pans, dresser, and the like, you will likely need to purchase or obtain some.
Some living situations, such as fraternities, co-ops, and the like may have additional fees, dues, or other financial obligations.
Many colleges and universities have resources for off-campus housing information.;
, Having a bank account will make financial transactions easier. Also, some landlords will not rent to someone without a bank account.


Be sure to have checks, a check register, a checkbook, and a binder or other method to save paperwork such as receipts, bank statements, and other paperwork. If you are not sure how to organize your finances, many banks and credit unions, on-line tutorials, or your parents, can show how to manage your checkbook and bank statements.
It is possible to pay rent and utilities with just cash or on-line payments, but even in this time very often you will still need to write a check.
Checks are usually safer to pay landlord and utilities than cash. Checks have some points of security that cash does not, like having to be signed in your handwriting, the bank will save information on your check, and so on.
An example: Say your landlord says you did not send payment for March's rent. You can present the landlord or a judge a physical or bank image of your cancelled check.
You can use cash for utilities and rent, but if you do, always get a receipt. Save them for legal, tax, and checkbook balancing purposes.
If you use on-line services, always print out and save payment information, and place in designated filing system. Utilities make payment errors all the time; do not count on the cable company to keep track of your payments.

, Very few people just out of college can afford an apartment of their own, so get used to the idea of living with a roommate, or two or more!


In university settings, often finding a group of people who get along well is the best way to go. You do not necessarily have to be best buddies, but having some level of trust, and knowing you can get along can count for a lot.
For some people, moving in with a boyfriend or girlfriend is a logical step. But keep in mind that this live in significant others is often much different than dating them. For one, if the two of you have a fight, you cannot simply head to your own dorm room. If the relationship sours, you may have to suddenly find a new apartment.
Craigslist.org and school bulletin boards are also a source of finding roommates. Of course, be careful and take reasonable precautions when meeting strangers.
Other living situations. With a little research, you may be able to find situations such as ""house-sharing."" For instance, you might live with an elderly woman for very low rent, and in return, you help care for her cats, do some housekeeping, and help her grocery shop once a week. You may not be able to have loud dance parties at your living situation, and you would share your space with the homeowner, but it can be a cost-saving and fulfilling situation.

, If you do not find an existing group of people who need a roommate, you may need to find roommates and also a rental.


Craigslist.org will usually have a lot of apartments and so on that are available.
Network. If you find out that your lab partner is planning to move out of town at graduation, that could be an your ""in"" with an available roommate situation.
Have the funds for rent and security deposit (if needed) available ASAP. You can be perfect roommate, but if you don't have the money to give the landlord on time, you will likely be passed over. Money talks.
Be prepared to provide a credit check, background check, and have references. Landlords today often require prospective tenants to submit to these things. Keep in mind relatives like Mom or your sister will not likely count as references. Instead, ask people like your professor, RA, your work supervisor, or student adviser.
Make sure your lease or rent is valid. It is not enough to simply have your friend say, ""Yeah, no problem, just bring your stuff over."" For your own legal protection, you should have your name on the lease. (Or, if applicable, a sublet). If not, it is possible you could end up in a legal limbo in which if things do not go right, you are possibly not legally entitled to be in your rental. Or you could be in an illegal situation in which ten people are in an apartment which is supposed to be for no more than four. Having your name on the lease gives you legal protection.
Be respectful of landlord rules. If your lease states ""no pets"", harboring a dog could get you evicted. If you are not to paint walls, don't do it.

, Life will likely go smoother if everyone agrees to a set of rules and guidelines. Some things to consider:


Chores / Housekeeping. Who will take out the trash? When will dishes be washed? Does vacuuming have to be done every week?
Deadlines for Rent and Utilities. Usually, one person has to manage the check cut to the landlord. When is the money due? Who will be in charge of it? What happens if it's late?
Shared Community ""Stuff"". Usually, all roommates don't have an individual roll of toilet paper for each person; everyone uses the supply. Sometimes it works out well to have a group ""coffee fund"". But how will it be funded? Who gets more when it's out?
Visitors. If you get a boyfriend, how often is it OK to have him over? Is it all right to invite five high school friends for a weekend, or is that just too many?
Inter-personal stuff. There's no RA to negotiate disputes anymore. If there's a problem, how will the roommates settle issues? It can also be helpful to note any rules that help make things go smoother. For instance, close the bathroom door to keep the cat from drinking from the toilet, and if it starts raining be sure all windows are closed, and make sure Chico's bike isn't blocked in by stuff in the hallway.
Parties. Usually, this comes down to how much notice to give, and who is invited. Also, when are late night parties OK, and when would it be a problem?

, This will vary from country to country, state to state, and are often very different from town to town. Since you are also now a resident in a neighborhood, you will also experience rules different than campus. For instance, know such things as:


What is the landlord responsible for / What are tenants responsible for?
When are ""Noise Ordinance"" hours? Many cities have laws regarding noise levels during certain times. Your 1 a.m. house party might land you a fine if neighbors complain.
Parking rules. If you have a car, motorcycle, scooter, or the like, be aware of parking ordinances. During a snowstorm, for instance, you may not be able to park on the street. Or any guests may have to park at the parking garage because if a car doesn't have a resident sticker, the tow truck will get them.
Experienced renters in a given town usually can give you insights.
Sometimes colleges or universities have resources helping students with housing issues.
Some cities and towns may have a government or non-profit organization to help people with housing disputes, such as clarification on ordinances and even legal help and advice.

"
Develop a timeline for creating and finishing your project.,
Develop key talking points before the critique.,
Communicate any questions or concerns to your professor.,
Breathe.,
Stand by your idea.,
Keep an open mind to critiques and try not to be defensive.,
Don’t dominate the conversation.,
Take notes, or have someone take notes for you.,
Don’t take it personally.,
Reflect on the feedback given.,
Be selective in the critiques you choose to incorporate into your work.,
Get to work!",How to Survive an Art School Critique," Waiting until the last minute to create artwork can often be disastrous and you may find yourself creating something that you are not proud of and that will not be evaluated favorably by your professors and peers. In order to create the most quality project possible, as soon as you are aware of the assignment, begin scheduling staggered deadlines for yourself to complete various stages of the project.


Use a calendar or planner, either paper or online, to set deadlines for yourself so you remain on task. Breaking the task up into smaller parts can make it feel less overwhelming and can ease your stress both during the semester and on the day of the critique.;
, If you have a well thought out “why” to your work, what it depicts, its purpose, and your thought process in creating it, you will fare much better in the oral aspect of your critique. A strong sense of knowledge and awareness of a piece that you created will be particularly helpful if your art is not its best on that particular project.


Write down some bullet points on a note card or keep some thoughts in your mind to help begin and further along the discussion.
If your project is a collection of pieces, be sure that you are prepared to articulate how they are related and interconnected.

, Your professors and instructors have an expansive knowledge of art and technique and are often more than willing to help should advice be solicited. Consult with them if you have any concerns or hesitations about making major decisions about projects.


For instance, if you are confused about an assignment, you might want to reach out to your professor via email and ask something like, “Is there a specific painting technique we are required to use?” or any question related to the topic at hand.

, In stressful situations, the body can often tense up, making you forget to breathe, which can lead to greater levels of anxiety and stress. You will be better able to cope with the intensity of the moment and to discuss and defend your work if you are breathing properly.


One quick breathing exercise that you can do before, during and after the critique is as follows: breathe in deeply and slowly through your nose, filling your lungs; pause for three seconds and then exhale slowly through your mouth with your lips slightly parted.

, If you've made decisions for a specific reason, explain them in an articulate and meaningful way. If your reasoning for employing a certain design or technique is important, share that information. Don’t allow others to believe that your decisions were random or arbitrary if they were intentional.


For example, if a classmate or your professor refers to your color choice as “random,” you might want to speak to how the color you choose is symbolic and has a deeper meaning; for instance, the color “red” might symbolize passion, blood, or war.

, It can be difficult to hear people pick apart your work, but remember to listen to reactions and opinions. They can help you further develop the piece and make it more successful and help you to develop your skills as an artist.It can be helpful to ask for clarification if you are confused about a certain point.
If you still feel that a rebuttal to a comment is necessary, search for something in the speaker’s critique that you can agree with while respectfully disagreeing with their larger point. For example, you might say, “I do agree that my brush strokes in that area could have been more precise, but I do not think that a change in scenery would convey the message that I sought to portray.”

, Though you should certainly speak to the strengths of your work as well as your design process, allow for a thorough critique from others. You will want to receive feedback on your craft so that you can improve your work.


Don’t interrupt anyone as they are critiquing your work, but rather listen as intently as possible.

, Critiques can be a bit of a whirlwind and it is easy to forget names of artists, suggestions and reactions. Often times, you will receive so many comments and suggestions that it would be impossible to remember them all, therefore, having everything written down will help you as you incorporate relevant suggestions later.


The experience can be an overwhelming one, so try not to dwell too much on the details in the moment, but revisit them later in your notes instead.

, It is more likely than not that most of those offering critiques are truly trying to help and are not doing so maliciously. Don’t take their comments as being inherently negative, but rather use the collective knowledge and strength in the room to your advantage later when editing your project.


In addition to not overreacting to negative critiques, you should also not allow positive feedback to overinflate your ego. A positive critique is always welcome, but too much confidence can make you lazy with future projects. , Talk about it with someone if you need to vent, sort out your thoughts, or celebrate. You may want to discuss the information with classmates who have endured similar critiques or with fellow artists in general. Make sure that you consider both the positive and the negative critiques offered.


Use the notes taken during your critique to think critically about your work. Read over them carefully and thoughtfully and begin to ponder on how you can synthesize these critiques to create a stronger project.

, Don't feel like you have to listen to everything everyone says, as this is very likely impossible as many may have conflicting ideas on how to improve your work. From the feedback you receive, pick and choose which ideas appeal to you and make any alterations to those suggestions that you deem appropriate.

, Now you’ll want to begin actually improving upon your work and incorporating the new approaches that you see most fit. Creating a project that successfully and strategically synthesizes good feedback will result in a stronger piece of artwork that will likely be critiqued even less.


For example, if you agree with certain feedback presented about your project, you will want to incorporate these improvements. Someone may have suggested that you lighten up the work using more pastel colors, so you could employ this in your art to create a stronger and more pleasing aesthetic.

This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t go to class, though, and some teachers will have an attendance policy. More importantly, skipping class means missing out on valuable learning. Don’t make your life more difficult by forcing yourself to cram come exam time. College is also expensive, and not going to class means that you are wasting a lot of your and/or your parents’ money—anywhere from $50 to $150 per one hour of class.Do the readings, taking notes as you do so. You’ll retain much more if you read actively, and your notes will help you out a ton when exam time rolls around.Participate if the class calls for it. Many college students hate or are afraid of speaking in front of groups, but you will get so much more out of your classes—and will enjoy them so much more—if you can get past this. Don’t be afraid of being wrong—your professor just wants you to try, and probably wasn’t asking a question with a “right” or “wrong” answer to being with.;
, You should spend the same amount of time on your schoolwork as you would on a full-time job—at least forty hours a week. Bank on spending an average of two hours outside of class for every hour you spend in class. The balance will vary by subject (labs, for instance, will tilt more toward in-class time), but your library or dorm room is where a lot of the really hard work will take place., Some people plagiarize because they think they can get away with it; others do so because they honestly don’t know what it means. Either way, you are responsible, and you will get caught. Many schools have very harsh penalties for this behavior, including automatically failing the class and/or including a special note on your transcript.Obvious plagiarism includes copying someone else's work and presenting it as your own and using someone else's words or ideas without citing her.
Not using quotation marks around quotations is also plagiarism, as is giving inaccurate or incorrect information about a source. (It's especially bad if you fabricate a source.)Bad paraphrasing is also plagiarism. A paraphrase condenses the ""gist"" of an idea into your own words. However, you may be plagiarizing if you retain most of the original's words, especially if you use the same basic sentence structure or the passages are substantially similar in length or style.Academic dishonesty more generally can include asking people to help you when you have been told to do all your own work, working together on a project if collaboration hasn't been assigned, and paying others to do work for you., Dirty little secret: many professors sit at their desks during office hours, waiting and hoping for someone, anyone to stop by. They will appreciate you so much if you are that person. If you have a question, this is a great way to ask it because it will help your professor put a name to your face. But consider stopping by early in the semester just to say hi and introduce yourself.Be reasonable about your expectations. Your professors won't proofread papers for you or give you essay topics. However, they're usually very happy to talk about your ideas with you to help you figure them out.

, For many college students, texting comes more naturally than emailing, but you can't expect your professors to give you their cell phone numbers. If you want to stay on top of your academics, you will need to check your email regularly. This is where you will see announcements from your teachers, department, etc.


If your courses use online course management, such as Blackboard, check these regularly too. Often, assignments and grades will only be posted here--if you don't check them regularly, you miss out.

, This goes for both the physical location and online databases. Your professors will assign a lot of these, especially at the beginning, but you will also need to learn how to do research on your own. Consider scheduling an orientation with a librarian, especially if you have never used a brick-and-mortar library before. You are sure not to be the only one, so don’t be embarrassed.


Most libraries have reference librarians for specific areas, such as hard sciences, music, or English. If you have a big project, it's a good idea to ask for a consultation with the reference librarian in your subject. She stays up to date with all the latest research and can guide you to the best sources., No matter who you are, you will probably read things that you don’t agree with. This is intentional—your professors aim to assign readings from many different perspectives, so they are assigning things that they don’t agree with, either. You don’t have to agree with the writers who challenge your beliefs, but do try to figure out where they are coming from and what makes them tick—that’s probably part of why they were assigned, anyway.

, Colleges and universities will require that you fulfill a certain number of credits in several different areas: general education (possibly broken down by subject matter), classes for your major, and electives. Meet with your advisor regularly to make sure you are staying on track—otherwise you might find yourself having to pay for a summer session or an extra semester that you weren’t planning on., If you are an engineering major, take a literature course. Poets, try biology. (These are just examples.) Either way, you will be exposed to new people, new ideas, and perhaps a new subject that you didn’t know you were interested in.Employers are often more interested in candidates who can do a wide range of things, such as write a coherent sentence and analyze formulas, rather than people whose focus was so specialized that they can't handle the wide-ranging demands of the modern job market., For some people, college is first and foremost an opportunity to let loose. For others, academics are the sole priority. Many people are probably somewhere in between. Wherever you stand, there will be others like you. Don’t feel pressured to drink or do anything else you don’t want to do.


That being said, remember that college is the time when you learn how to be your own adult. Make choices that line up with your values and make you happy. Remember that sometimes, you and your parents or other authority figures may disagree, and that's okay.

, Sharing a room is challenging, especially if you have never had to do so before. Start off on the right foot by talking about how the space should be used, and respect those decisions once they are made.This includes decisions about both the physical space and behavior. Where do you stand on drinking in the room? Having parties? Hosting overnight guests? Try to hash out an agreement, and consult your Resident Advisor (RA) if you cannot.If problems come out, communicate your concerns. It doesn’t help to be passive aggressive or let things fester. Your roommate is probably not doing things to bother you intentionally, so give them the benefit of the doubt and see if you can work things out.Even if you and your roommate get along great, it is a good idea to spend some time apart. Make sure you aren’t sticking to them to the exclusion of making other friends.
Whether you can’t stand your roommate or are best friends who are constantly gabbing, you might find it helpful to identity a place outside of your room to study, be it the library or a local coffee shop.
If all else fails, know that you are learning valuable people skills that will help you deal with difficult individuals in the future.
If you feel threatened by your roommate or your roommate is engaging in any illegal behavior, talk to your RA. You may be able to switch rooms. At the very least, you will have a record that you reported the activity and weren't a part of it.

, College offers new freedoms, but it also introduces new risks. Make sure that your behavior does not harm your health.


If you are going to drink, do so in moderation, and have a designated driver. Also know your school may have rules against drinking on campus, even if you are legal drinking age.
College women have probably heard many tips over the years about how to avoid rape and other forms of sexual assault—don’t put your drink down, stick to well-lit paths, tell a friend where you are and what time you will be home, etc.—but it is important to know that, no matter what behavior you engage in, the sole responsibility for any attack lies with your assailant, and you have a right to pursue legal or other actions. Report attacks to the police, and talk to a counselor about next steps., This applies across the board—drinking, skipping class, sex, you name it. There are no parents looking over your shoulder to punish you, but you are also an adult who needs to take responsibility for your own actions.

, This will probably end up being the time in your life when you have the most opportunity to learn from people with backgrounds radically different from your own. You are really lucky to have access to this, so take advantage of it.


Take courses with a multicultural focus. Attend cultural events and lectures on campus. These things will broaden your perspective and help you clarify your own values. Even if you end up holding your own ideas even more firmly, it's good to know where others are coming from.

, In addition to having fun, you’ll improve your ability to deal with different people, run an organization, etc. You might even find that you use these skills and experiences in your career down the road.This advice goes double for transfer or commuter students, who may feel disconnected from campus life.

, You’re busy, surrounded by heavy foods, and on a limited budget—all while taking care of yourself for the first time. In this situation, it can be easy to rely on the choices available in the dining hall—choices that won’t always make you feel your best. Take care of yourself so you have the energy you need to fulfill all of your responsibilities.Fuel up with breakfast. Not everyone is hungry in the morning, but for those who are, a healthy start to the day will make those early classes easier to face. In the dining hall, look for fiber- or protein-packed foods like whole grain cereal, oatmeal, fresh fruit, yogurt, and eggs. Keep protein bars and non-perishable fruit in your dorm room for those mornings when you’re really in a rush.
Power through the day with lunch and dinner. Sandwiches on whole-grain bread and salads with lean protein will give you the energy you need to get through the day. Watch portion sizes, too—something that’s especially hard in an all-you-can-eat cafeteria situation. Large amounts of even healthy foods can make you feel sluggish.
Stock up on healthy snacks. Even if you don’t have a refrigerator or microwave, you can keep whole-wheat bread, some peanut butters, granola bars, apples, bananas, some jerkies, and nuts in your dorm room. If you have access to a refrigerator or microwave, you can expand to milk, yogurt, more fruit, and veggie burgers. Be wary of prepared foods like canned soup and frozen meals, which tend to have a lot of sodium.
Know that it’s all about moderation. With all that you’re dealing with, it can be easy to think that that food is the one thing you can control, but it’s important to make sure you’re not restricting yourself too much. By all means, get the occasional late-night slice of pizza with your friends. If you think that your thoughts or behaviors are sliding into dangerous territory, talk to your counseling center about eating disorder support., Regular exercise is one of the best ways to manage the stress that you are dealing with as a college student. You might think that you are too tired or do not have time to fit this in, but it will give you so much more energy that it will be more than worth it.Your school will probably have a gym that you have access to free of charge.


Know when to go. Especially if you are a beginner, a crowded gym can be intimidating. It will be busiest at the beginning of each semester, in the morning, and in the evening. If you can, ease yourself in by going at off hours.
Consider a session with a trainer. Trainers at college gyms are usually fellow students who can evaluate your fitness level and recommend an exercise plan.
Expose yourself to new forms of exercise. Your gym will probably offer classes in everything from aerobics to Zumba.Hold yourself accountable by signing up with a friend.

, As a college student, you may find yourself dealing in new ways with depression, anxiety, eating disorders, substance abuse, relationship issues, and more. Your school’s health center will offer many resources to help you thrive in spite of these challenges. Don’t hesitate to take advantage of these resources.Many schools will offer confidential counseling sessions with a licensed practitioner or graduate student, often free of charge for a certain number of sessions.
You are also likely to find support groups, especially those that deal with issues common to college students.
If you are in crisis, call 911 or contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) immediately., You can get a great education anywhere, so consider whether your dream school is really worth it. You might regret it a few years down the road, when you can’t afford to take on a cool internship, go to graduate school, or live where you want because your student loan payments take up such a big chunk of your monthly budget.If you do have to borrow, exhaust your Federal financial aid before taking out any private student loans. Federal student loans have lower interest rates, more forgiving repayment plans, and subsidized loans even pay for the interest while you're enrolled in school.

, Part of college is learning to adopt adult responsibilities, and building a good credit history is part of that. It's often a good idea to apply for a student credit card to help you build your credit history. This way, when you graduate you'll have a decent history and a good credit score to help you find an apartment or auto loan.Don't consider this a blank check to spend whatever you want. You still need to have a budget and keep to it.
Don't charge more than you can afford to pay off at the end of the month. This way, you'll avoid accruing interest on your purchases, and you'll be less likely to blow a few hundred bucks on something fun but frivolous.
Some student-oriented credit cards, like the Discover It card, even offer rewards for good grades. Every little bit helps!, Yes, it’s one more responsibility eating away at your time, but social activities cost money. Many students, of course, are contributing to or paying for all of their tuition. Look into work-study jobs that are designed for students and may offer more flexibility., Take advantage of the fact that you are on a college campus. In addition to sports games, you will find readings, plays, and many other activities on campus, often at a cheaper student rate. Some local businesses will also give you a discount for being a student

, Depending on how much you eat and how easy it is for you to cook where you live, you may benefit from purchasing a college meal plan. Most meal plans will give you a daily or per-meal cost. Have a look at your weekly grocery budget and figure out whether it's cheaper to eat most of your meals in the cafeteria or cook more.


If you have a scholarship that includes a meal plan, maximize your money by eating as many meals on-campus as you can. That'll give you more money for books or even the occasional splurge.

, Most professors love helping students, so don’t be afraid to approach them for help. Don’t wait until the end of the semester, though. By that point, your grades may have suffered beyond repair, and your teachers will be busy with end-of-the-semester responsibilities.Keep in mind that extra credit is rarely a part of college classes. Every assignment counts.
If you find that extreme mitigating circumstances make it impossible to complete an assignment on time, contact your professor before the due date. They would much rather have you ask for an extension than explain why you didn’t turn something in.

, One of college professors’ greatest concerns is that their students don’t have strong enough writing skills to succeed. If you are the exception to this trend, you will shine in their eyes. Many schools offer writing centers to help you through tricky assignments.Make sure you are familiar not only with spelling, grammar, punctuation, etc., but also what different subjects expect in terms of paper structure and citation style.
Consider visiting the writing center even if you are a competent writer. Everyone can benefit from having a second set of eyes read their writing and suggest improvements.

, Colleges and universities offer accommodations to students who require them for both physical and mental reasons. Accommodations can include changes to how you take tests, turn in assignments, and more. However, you will have to be proactive to secure these accommodations for yourself.Remember that though your professors are experts in the subjects that they teach, they are neither qualified nor appropriately positioned to determine what kind of accommodations individual students need. If you approach them at the end of the semester to tell them that mental illness interfered with your schoolwork, they will likely be sympathetic, but they will not be able to help you.
Instead, approach your school’s disability support system as early as possible. You will probably need certification from a mental health professional before accommodations can be made.
Your professors will not know what your diagnosis is—they will just see the changes you need so that you can succeed (more time on exams, a flexible attendance policy, etc.).

Research your transfer pathway.,
Decide which institution, and specifically which program, you're interested in transferring credits to.,
Determine which credits are required in the program you've selected.,
Identify which credits you will be transferring.,
Request your official transcript.,
Gather your course outlines.,
Request a meeting with an academic advisor, or faculty.,
Provide the academic advisor/faculty member with your transcript(s) and course outline(s).,
Be patient.,
Follow up on your transfer.,
Drop necessary courses, if applicable.,
Share your experience with faculty and administration at your previous institution.,
If your credits have successfully been evaluated, you will now be a few steps closer to graduation.",How to Transfer College or University Credits," It is important to research your transfer(s). Prior to beginning this process you should learn the following: Does a transfer pathway already exist for these credits? Many institutions have designated transfer pathways between specific programs. For example: if you're using a Police Foundations diploma as leverage to complete your Criminology degree, many universities have likely already created a seamless transfer pathway for students completing this traditional transfer.
, This will be critical. Some institutions are more likely to accept transfer credits than others, same goes with individual programs. Do your research - it can save you (more) time and money.

, Each program generally publicizes the required courses. If this is not publicly available, contact their faculty and request a copy of the requirements. Faculty's contact information should be included on the website.

, This is a critical step in the process. It is important you compare your completed credits to those required in the program you're applying to. Determine if you're able to transfer any 'core credits' or if you're simply transferring credits that will be applied as electives or general education credits., Once you've determined where and which credits you're planning to transfer, you will require the documents that prove your educational experience. You will require an 'official' transcript as part of the evaluation process. You will have to request this document from your previous institution, whether over the phone, online or in-person. Typically the Registrars or Admissions office will be responsible for this information.


It would be wise to ask for two copies, one for you and one for the institution you are transferring into. In order for the document to be official it must be sealed, only open one copy (this is why asking for two is wise). It should be noted that some schools will charge a fee for processing the transcript while others will do it at no charge.

, Course outlines (also known as a course syllabus) are the contract between a professor and their students. They detail the learning outcomes for any student who successfully completes their course. These outlines are the specific details that will be used to evaluate your actual credits. Focus on retrieving outlines for the courses you believe will transfer, but if possible provide the advisor with ALL your course outlines - you never know which credits will surprisingly transfer over, even if as electives.

, Find out who is responsible for transfer credit evaluations. Typically, you will work with an academic advisor who initiates the process on your behalf but senior faculty members are usually involved in the process as well., This is your moment, this meeting will officially begin the process of transferring credits from one institution to another. Prior to the meeting, ask what you should bring with you (remember this set of instructions is general and each school may require additional items, or less items), This process will vary depending on the amount of transfer credits and which institution is processing the request. It can range anywhere from immediately to weeks. If you are going through this process during peak season (typically July - September) you will likely experience a longer wait time.

, It is important to establish this during your meeting. Institutions have different processes for transfer credits., Find out how your credits transfer. Some schools will block enroll you into a schedule, in this case it will be your responsibility to drop the individual courses which you've already received credit for. Other schools require you to create your own schedule, you should be equally as careful to not duplicate any courses that are unnecessary., This may help a future student transfer their credits more seamlessly, or even create a new pathway., Your work load just got a bit lighter!

Come to class.,
Take notes.,
Complete the assigned reading and (if you have time) the suggested reading.,
Participate.,
Study for tests.,
Show up for clinical.,
Listen to your instructors.,
Volunteer or work as an aide during breaks or over the summer.",How to Succeed in Nursing School," Yes, it's college and not high school, so the attendance policy may be a little lax, if it exists at all. However, the reason no attendance policy exists is that you are in class of your own free will and you've paid a lot of money to be there. So why wouldn't you show up? Besides, if you're not in class, you often miss key material that shows up on the test later.;
, If a teacher stresses a point frequently, consider it something important, both in terms of your nursing practice, and in terms of what will be on the test. Also, if you take notes, you are more likely to retain the information. Essentially, you learn the material three times: once when you hear it, once when you write it down, and once again later when you read your own notes to study.

, The best way to deal with reading is to follow the syllabus and read the material before that specific class. If you have questions as you're reading, write them down so you can ask in class. Which brings us to...

, Ask questions of the teacher and answer the questions your teacher poses to you. The more engaged you are in the class, the more you'll get out of it.

, Find a method of studying that works for you. Go through your notes (once immediately following class, and again before the test); if you are a highlighter, go through your highlighted textbook; if you are a social animal, go for some collective study sessions (just make sure they don't turn into gossip sessions).

, In the Army, the saying goes: ""right time, right place, right uniform, right attitude."" The same holds true for clinical. Although class may not have a strict attendance policy, you can bet that clinical will. Therefore, if you show up late (without a good excuse, that is), it marks you as unprofessional and will invariably hurt your grade. Also, make sure you know where you're supposed to meet. Hospitals are confusing places, so showing up early on the first day is a good idea. Make sure that your uniform is ironed, fits properly, and is clean. Lastly, join clinical in the right spirit. Clinical is where the rubber meets the road and you implement everything you learn in class. So, seek out new opportunities and don't be afraid to try new skills. Look up your patients' labs and medicines, which will familiarize you with them for tests and the NCLEX-RN.

, Although you will get frustrated with some of them, bear in mind that they have been nurses for a long time and really do know what they are talking about. Also, a good nursing instructor will also want you to succeed. The biggest frustration for nursing instructors is when students do not seek them out when they are having trouble. Therefore, if you are struggling with anything, talk to your nursing instructor about it. Bear in mind, they are trained to listen and to help others. Trust them.

, Not only does this look great on a resume, it gives you valuable experience in the healthcare setting.

Look at the course schedule often and early.,
Align similar courses so they’re next to each other in your schedule.,
Create a back-up plan.,
Schedule classes at times you’ll be more awake.,
Set aside study time.,
Consider taking online classes.",How to Schedule Your College Classes Effectively1," Familiarize yourself with the courses your college is offering each semester. The sooner you know what courses are being offered, the sooner you can register for those classes.It will be a hassle to enroll in a class that is already full. You may have to petition the professor or the department or, unfortunately, wait until a different semester or year to take the course.;
, Especially if you’re going from class to class three or four times in a row, it can be helpful to schedule similar classes (i.e. within the sciences or humanities) next to each other. This will give you easier transitions between classes. It would be difficult to switch from Biology to Political Science, then back to Chemistry.


For example, if you’re taking a lab-based course, try to schedule the class right before or after the coinciding lecture course.

, Since college classes (especially popular ones) can fill up quickly, you should have one or two courses to fall back on, if you first choices are full. Ideally, these back-ups should still be required courses for your degree, or at least Gen Eds, so that you’re not just taking multiple electives.


Since it can be more enjoyable to go to a class if you’re taking it with a friend, see if you can find a friend or two to take one of your back-up classes with you.
Working with a friend in class can motivate you to attend regularly, and gives you a study partner that you’ll work well with.

, Ask yourself: are you a morning person, or do you prefer to stay up late? If you’re not a morning person, you can schedule classes that begin around 10 or 11 am, or even noon.Find class times that work well for you.


Some students also have trouble focusing during afternoon classes (especially right after lunch), or can’t stay awake during evening classes. Find what times work best for you.

, In addition to scheduling your in-class time, you’ll benefit from setting aside specific time in which you’ll study, review the class work from the day, and do your homework. Start out by following the 2:1 rule: two hours per week outside of the classroom for every hour in the classroom.So, if you’re taking 4 classes and spending roughly 12 hours per week in the classroom, start out by scheduling 24 hours (3 hours every night) of homework time.

, If you have a hard time finding an agreeable schedule, or can’t get into the in-seat classes that you want or that your degree requires, look into taking online classes. Some students enjoy online work more than others, but as more and more colleges increase their online course offerings, you should at least know they’re an option.Although online classes can ease your weekly schedule, they require as much work and discipline as in-seat classes.

,
Graduate successfully from the program.",How to Survive a Part Time MBA Program,";
, There is no substitute to meeting and talking with people who are in the process or already completed a program.

, Understand in advance if the company is supportive of part-time education. Enrolling and then missing classes due to long work hours or business travel is usually disruptive.

, This is the most important step in pursuing your plans. An unhappy personal life can ruin the chances of successfully completing a part-time program.

, Apply to more than one program in your area to increase your chances of enrollment. However, do not join a program if it does not fit your personal and professional goals.

, Consult with senior students and with the school recommendations on best courses to take early on. Usually, there are required courses that lay the foundation for other courses to be taken at a later stage.

, Work in contingencies such disruptions due to job or family. Follow through on the time-table.

, Part-time MBA programs are as much about course work as they are about networking with fellow students, companies and other institutions. Focus on grades alone can turn out to be short-sighted and may not help in leveraging the program to the fullest.

, Part-time MBA program is like a tripod. One shaky leg can leave you imbalanced. Apply the lessons from the program in your work to demonstrate the value added. Set aside time for your family and try to make the time spent together special. Remember, graduating successfully from a part-time MBA program is the best signal of your capacity to lead and manage teams.

,, Hopefully, the trials and tribulations are worth it and you are able achieve the goals set out before the start of the program.

Try to have some time off each day.,
Schedule something fun during the week.,
Balance academic activities with your job.",How to Schedule Your College Classes Effectively2," You need some time to study, get help from teachers, make new friends, and just relax. It’s better to be moderately busy every day, than to have one or two days where you’re overwhelmed with classes.


This may mean deliberately leaving a class period empty, so you can have a long lunch. You could also get your classes out of the way in the morning, and give yourself the afternoon to unwind.

, This will give you an outlet during your week, and give you time to socialize and make new friends. During college, it can be easy to waste time, so it will help if you commit to a weekly social activity. This could include:


Going to a ball game or sports event.
Taking dancing lessons with your friends or partner.
Get a group of friends to see a movie on the same night every week.

, More and more students are working to help put themselves through college. If you’re working, your job will be an important part of your life, and may take up substantial time during your week. Try to find out your work schedule as early as possible, and schedule your classes around your work.Work with your supervisor. Let him or her know that you’re attending college as well as working, and ask if they can adjust your work schedule to accommodate your academic schedule.
If you’re looking for work, consider finding a job on campus. Check with your college’s Human Resources department, or check into Student Employment opportunities in your department.

Plan out how many courses you’ll take each semester.,
Spread out classes for your major.,
Balance your required courses and your electives.,
Aim to challenge yourself, but be realistic.",How to Schedule Your College Classes Effectively3," Most universities require students to take 12 credits (4 classes) in order to be considered “Full Time.”That said, some semesters you may want to take more than four classes, for example, if a class you need is only offered once a year.


When you start Freshman year, make a rough schedule of which classes you’ll need to take during which of your eight college semesters.

, Try to spread your major courses out over different semesters. Although it’s common (and encouraged) to complete your Gen Eds early in your college career and then focus on classes for your major, you should still take classes towards your major during that time.If a student were to take the majority of the courses for her major within the first two years of college, she would be left taking entry-level general-education classes (Gen Eds) during her last few semesters.
In the long run, the classes for your major will be most important to your education and your degree, and they’ll also be the most intellectually rewarding.
If you’re taking more than one major class in a semester, spread them out during the week.

, Required courses include Gen Ed classes, and courses for your major. You can choose your electives from among many non-major courses. Focus on completing your required courses, but you can lighten your course load by mixing in an elective each semester.Plan to complete the Gen Ed courses early.These classes are usually populated with underclassmen, and you’ll lose interest and motivation in taking intro-level courses as you move farther into your college career.

, It’s one thing to take a difficult course every semester, but don’t overwhelm yourself with upper-level courses and countless credit hours, especially in your first year.Plan to take a mix of challenging classes and easier classes every semester.This way, you won’t switch between semesters that overwhelm you and semesters that don’t challenge you.

Avoid taking things personally.",How to Succeed in Medical School," Even though you already have a few years of college education under your belt, medical school will be a very different challenge. Using the same study skills you used through your earlier undergraduate years may not suffice anymore. You may need to experiment with different studying methods and see which works best for you as a medical student.Make sure you are learning and studying actively rather than passively. Active learning requires you to ask questions about the material you are learning. You might consider: “What about this section of material is important? How do I fit this piece in with the larger picture of what I’m studying? What is the exact meaning of this?” Passive learning, on the other hand, might entail simply re-reading notes or going through the textbook with a highlighter. Incorporating studying into other daily activities can be helpful, as well. Try listening to recorded lectures a second time on your phone while working out at the gym, or while doing chores around the house.Success in medical school is often tied to how much time can be devoted to learning a topic, and trying hard consistently.;
, In addition to better understanding your own learning methods, you also need to work on studying smarter and more effectively. Use lectures, textbooks, and notes in varying ways until you find the way that works best for you.Pay special attention to the diagrams and figures in your textbooks. These are great visual representations of the reading, and understanding these images can be crucial to getting a full understanding of the concepts. This is quite important that you correlate concepts and structures in the anatomy atlas.
Use textbooks as a reference point when going over lecture notes or handouts. If you are having trouble understanding something from class, use the textbook to clarify things.
Spend time each day writing a brief summary of your lectures. Make sure you understand the key points that your professor wanted you to take away from it. Write down questions you still have and see if the textbook can offer some answers, and if it can’t, discuss these points with your professor or classmates.
Avoid pulling all-nighters, even if that may have worked when you were an undergraduate. Tests in medical school are going to be a lot more in-depth and more complicated, and they are often cumulative. Studying steadily over the course of the week will be more effective.

Stay organized. Medical school is notable for an exceedingly large amount of information to be learned, and at times much of the information will seem unrelated. You will need to constantly integrate information between textbooks, lecture notes, labs, and lecture slides that do not always consistently integrate in real time.

, Either end of the tutoring equation can be helpful; you can gain insight and experience from being tutored just as well as doing the tutoring yourself. If your school has a tutoring center, visit it and see what kind of opportunities exist there.Tutoring and study groups serve a great purpose during medical school, as they can help you remember that you are not going through this difficult process all alone. There are other students just like you, and just having that support group can help ease some of the pressure and stress.

, You may have already learned this lesson as an undergraduate student, but in medical school especially, attendance has a great deal of influence on the level of success a student can achieve. If you are not present to learn the material through instruction, your success will most definitely begin to diminish.Not only can poor attendance affect your grades and success, it can also reflect poorly on you as a professional. As a medical student, you are in training to become a medical professional, and you need to begin working on your professional demeanor and establishing professional habits—which includes being where you are meant to be, and being there on time.

, Try to schedule time both before and after each class to preview and look back over notes and material for that class. This will help you get engaged with the material prior to the lesson beginning, and then help it settle into your memory more by looking over it again after the lesson ends.Make sure you schedule important or difficult tasks, like studying or schoolwork, for periods of the day when you know you will be the most awake and ready to work. For example, you won’t want to schedule time to study for a test right before bed when you are likely to be tired and ready to sleep. Schedule these difficult or challenging things first, and then plan to do less taxing things later on.

, Planning a set schedule for the time you will spend outside of the classroom is just as important as following your class schedule. Setting a schedule for things like study time, personal time, and appointments will help you maintain good habits and be less likely to forget to complete or work on something important.Use an online calendar or an app on your smartphone to maintain your schedule. Mark in appointments, group classes at the gym, and lunch with friends. Having these personal things marked will help you better out your studying schedule while still maintaining time for yourself and taking care of things you need to do.

, Everyone has things that they are exceptional at, and other things that they have to work a little harder on. As a medical student, you probably have had a pretty successful academic career so far, so getting a low grade on something in medical school might feel a bit discouraging or upsetting. But, rather than focusing on these weaker areas and letting them consume you, try your best to better yourself in them, while still recognizing and playing off your strengths in other areas.Don’t lose sight of the subjects you really excel at in an attempt to pour yourself into the subjects you are struggling in. Keep a balanced study routine and do your best in all subjects.
To succeed in med school it's important you keep a good attitude and remain enthusiastic. This will help you stay motivated and being interested in the material will help you retain it better., Most schools will likely have a mentoring program you can enroll in to be matched with older students or established medical doctors that can advise you and help you along your way through school. If your school doesn’t have one, try networking around your program. Professors might have suggestions for mentors in the community that they can help you connect with.Establishing a relationship with a few mentors can bring some great benefits. You will know other established doctors upon your graduation and you will have a handful of people to call on when you might need recommendation letters for residency applications.

, This includes exploring different medical fields as well as exploring the world around you. Some programs might offer study abroad opportunities that can give you a chance to learn about other cultures and the medical professionals that serve them.Even if you want to specialize in a certain field, learn as much as you can from other fields as well. Taking on a research project in another specialization or taking classes outside of your specific field can help give you a well-rounded education while it’s available to you.

, Just like you did through your undergraduate years, you will have a faculty or department advisor through medical school who will help you direct your course of study and keep you on track academically. But more than that, she has likely been through medical school herself, and will have a clear idea of how to help you succeed, as well as being able to offer valuable advice and insight.Your advisor is another very important professional relationship you should work on fostering and maintaining through medical school. She can be of great assistance to you both while you are in the program and after you finish and are working on residency applications.

, Student organizations are great opportunities to bulk up your residency applications, as well as gain some practical experience in the community. Your program/campus likely has a few established organizations specifically geared towards medical students.Most universities have a great deal of other valuable resources for students, as well, including counseling centers, health clinics, and recreation centers. You will likely be paying a student fee for these things anyway, so you might as well take advantage of them!

, Just like you probably sought out volunteer opportunities when working on your medical school applications, you should keep doing so through medical school. They can help enhance your residency applications, but they can also enrich your learning experience by giving you valuable and practical experience with members of your community.Volunteering is yet another way to find a mentor if your program doesn’t have a mentorship program. It can connect you with doctors in the area and help you establish relationships with people outside of your program.

, Medical school is just a step on your way to a residency, and taking the licensing exam. After you pass your exam and get matched with a residency, you will need to be prepared for the hectic, exhausting schedule that often comes with your first year as a resident.Start preparing for your licensing exam in your first year of medical school. Passing this exam and landing a residency should be your goals for med school, so you should have both of these things in mind through the entire process. Work with mentors and professors to decide where you might fit best in a residency, and for help with your applications when the time comes.
Take practice licensing exams and attend any seminars offered at your program to prepare for the test.
Residency often entails long hours and work weeks, so make sure you get into the habit of taking care of yourself and maintaining your personal wellness through medical school in preparation for residency.

, Medical school can oftentimes feel all-consuming; it takes up so much of your time that you may feel like you have none leftover for yourself. This is why it’s important to make time for yourself, even if you have to schedule little moments to yourself here and there. You want to balance your academic and personal life so you don’t end up burned out or too overwhelmed.Have an activity that you enjoy doing that you can resort to when you need a break. Whether it’s reading a book for fun, going for a bike ride or taking a jog, or even just making yourself a home-cooked meal, make sure you allow yourself the luxury of personal time now and then.

, In medical school, it can be easy to settle into a kind of social bubble with the other students in your cohort. You might find that these people become your only friends, as you spend most of your time with them. But, it’s important to keep friends that are not doctors, or training to be doctors. You want to give yourself a chance to disconnect from it now and then and have conversations that don’t revolve around what you’re working on or learning in school.Taking time away from campus and the people you are constantly around will help you gain some perspective on the whole experience of medical school. By taking a step back, you can get a better idea of what you’re doing and why you’re doing it, so taking time away now and then is really important.

, Make sure you work regular exercise into your schedule. There are ways to incorporate exercise without neglecting your studies, like reading a textbook while you walk on the treadmill, or listening to a lecture in your headphones while you work out. Exercise can help you stay physically healthy, while also helping to reduce stress.Getting adequate sleep goes hand-in-hand with getting exercise when working towards maintaining good physical health. Especially as a medical student, you need to make sure you are getting enough rest so you can perform your best academically.

, Try your best to eat fresh foods rather than processed. Rather than grabbing that sugary snack on the way out the door, grab a piece of fresh fruit instead. Make time to eat a properly balanced meal as often as you can each week.It may seem like processed or sugary foods are the easiest option, especially as a busy (and probably a bit financially strained) medical student. But, working in fresh foods when it’s possible can make a big difference in your overall health and well-being.

, Staying as close to campus as possible might seem like the best option when taking on a demanding medical school course schedule, but living outside of campus housing will probably be the better choice. You will limit the distractions that often come with living in dorms and student housing, and give yourself the physical and mental space you need to unwind each day from the stress of school.If you need to take on a roommate to help pay the rent, try to room with another medical student. Not only will you have a built-in support system with someone who understands the stress you’re dealing with, but they will likely have similar study habits and ambitions, so you will likely have far less distractions.

, Medical school brings about an entirely new hierarchy that you will need to adjust to. Don’t be offended if older students or doctors brush you off. Try not to let yourself get too discouraged if you aren’t at the very top of your class right away. Medical school is an immense challenge, and it will take time, practice, hard work, and dedication to succeed.Remember to periodically take inventory of all the successes you have had so far. Remind yourself that you have already done an immense amount of hard work to get to where you are, and that alone is proof that you are capable.

Set an academic goal for yourself.",How to Succeed in College1," College academics, especially in the first term, will be especially difficult because it is new material that you have never seen before. Plus, you are facing much higher expectations for performance and the expectation that YOU are the one responsible for your own motivation and success. Unlike high school, college expects you to build your education from the bottom up, rather than regurgitating whatever facts a teacher feeds you. This means much more work than you are used to.


Give yourself incentives to study in advance. Don't cash your paycheck until you're finished with that term paper. Celebrate with friends after you've taken the test. Treat yourself to something you've been wanting after you finish your studying goals.
Choose your priorities. It is not possible to fit in all the same social, academic, employment, and logistical responsibilities in college that you did in high school. Be realistic about how much time is required to meet your academic obligations and how much you can devote to social activities.;
, Take a moment to reflect on what you enjoy doing and studying, and what you're genuinely interested in. What are your goals? What are your plans? College is another step on the ladder to the rest of your life. What do you want to do after college, and how will college prepare you for that next step?

, Most colleges require a broad range of classes in the beginning, often referred to as ""general education"" or ""distribution"" requirements. Even if you've already declared your major and know what you want to study, the distribution requirements build critical skills such as written and oral communication, critical thinking and problem solving skills. Keep your mind open and look for ways to apply these skills within your major.


Another reason to take advantage of this broad range of classes in college is that you're likely to change careers over your lifetime, and even a class or two can make an impact in know-how and understanding. Anecdotally, you are likely to be in a different field at the end of your career than the one in which you started. , Learn to use observations and evidence to form your own opinions. Attend special events and seminars on campus. Join clubs for students in your major program. Read a *reliable* news site every day. You are your own person, and you owe it to yourself to form your own opinions about things.

, A big mistake college students make is never forming a relationship with their professors. Forming a relationship with professors can help make your education richer and your network bigger.


Go to office hours with the serious intent of improving your mastery of the course material, NEVER just to ""show your face"" in an attempt to suck up, change a grade, or appear more dedicated. Office hours are your opportunity for extra help with ideas and methodologies with which you are having trouble. Arrive prepared with specific questions. Brings your class notes and your textbook. Ask specific questions about the concepts where you need help. Professors will not repeat an entire lecture that you missed. Professors want to help you, but always remember that YOU are responsible for your own motivation and your own success.

Look for a mentor. A mentor can be a professor or staff member who can dispense advice specific to your personal goals. Start with the professors in your major department. There is usually a program advisor who helps you choose classes, and can make recommendations on graduate school. However, do not expect a mentor to secure a job for you after you have graduated.

, Everyone studies in a different way. Having a television or music in the background is a bad idea. Some people like to study alone. Some people like studying in groups. Find out what habits work best for you. Ask yourself and answer these questions:


How much time does it take an idea to stick for you? Do you need weeks before the light bulb goes off, or days?
What kind of a learner are you? Keep in mind that while you may have a preferred way of learning things, this does not excuse you from engaging with other teaching and learning styles. Are you:
An auditory learner? Do you learn by hearing something? You would rather have an idea explained aloud than reading in.
A visual learner? Do you learn by seeing something? You would rather learn by looking at graphs, reading, or watching a demonstration.
A kinesthetic learner? Do you learn by touching something? You would rather build whatever you're reading about, and see it in action.


What time of the day do you work best? Do you bust out a lot of work in the morning, or are you a night owl?

, If you don't set any academic goal, you might leave college wondering whether you tried enough. Your academic goal doesn't have to be the same as someone else's goal. Try to be realistic about it when you set it; balance it out with other personal goals you may have. Getting through college isn't always about getting a 4.0 or graduating summa cum laude. It's about doing the best you're capable of, given your resources.

Make a list of the skill or knowledge set you want to gain.,
Consider what paths you may take that would require degrees.,
Consider what paths you may take that may not require degrees.,
Establish if your schedule can handle family, work and/or school.,
Overcome your fear of the lecture hall.",How to Return to School in Your Fifties1," To do this, you need to ask yourself a few questions. Are these for a new job, to change position with a company you already belong to, and/or to add to your competitiveness in the future? Answering these questions now will help match you to a suitable college and program.Research skills that are in demand in your workplace if you're seeking to move within your own place of employment. Your own human resources contact may provide you with this information.
Pay attention to in-demand skills outside your workplace if you're seeking employment elsewhere from your current environment. The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education is one starting place for information: ;
, The career choice you are planning to make, especially if it's something to move into more complex areas of the workforce, will usually require a more advanced degree.


Are you looking for research-intensive skill paths such as medicine, law, computers, engineering? Those require classroom instruction and supervised practical exercises--so you will need schooling.
Are you looking for financial or business training for career paths in banking or investing? Higher level positions in those industries require a college or even graduate degree.

, Keep in mind there are a number of cases where going back to school may not be the right option for you given your career choice. Some work fields will train you themselves without schooling elsewhere, or use online/correspondence training. Pharmacy technicians, financial clerks, real estate, law enforcement, and fitness training are just a few of the positions you could consider for employment without a degree.

, Will the additional time commitments placed on you by classes and schoolwork be a problem if you have existing family and work responsibilities? There are flexible schedules available at most colleges/universities that students in their 50s can take advantage of. After you've selected a college and program, if you are unable to handle a full-time load of classes, determine with your program's advisor how much time it will take to complete a degree with a part-time schedule.
Some classes are offered in multiple time slots, so this may create some flexibility.
Distance Learning/Online classes also may be an option to increase schedule choices. These will require computer/internet access.
Consider discussing your educational needs with your family members and employer if you feel comfortable. You may be able to arrange an alternate schedule with them that allows you time to attend classes and study. Some employers offer incentives or funding for educational advancement--consult your human resources contact for more information.

, There are many students in their 50s or older that attend classes in person. Being away from the classroom environment for years should not deter you from pursuing higher education regardless of your reason for doing so. Seeking more competitive skills and/or knowledge is not exclusive to any age. Make sure whatever school you choose is flexible and accommodating in scheduling for adult students specifically.
Many colleges/universities will have quite a number of adult learners, so you should not feel ""alone"" even if you may be the only one in a particular class.
Whether it's a class of 20 or 200, don't be afraid to participate in a class. You are all there to learn.

"
Establish as many friendships as possible.,
Get involved in clubs, traditions, and events.,
Go to parties.,
If you decide to have sex, make it safe.,
Never eat alone.",How to Succeed in College2," If you're at a bigger school, you may find the sheer number of new people a bit intimidating. That's okay. Everyone feels that way at first. Get past the intimidation of the numbers and you'll find dozens, if not hundreds, of people that you get with and learn from. Many people look back on their college years with good memories, often because of the friendships that they made.

, College events are lot different from the compulsory events you might have done in high school. Because no one is forced to participate, the people who are there enjoy being there on their own. It's no secret the real draw of clubs and events is the social aspect. You'll probably meet a lot of people with similar interests, a few people you don't get along with, and a few people with absolutely amazing backgrounds. C'est la vie: it's a cross-section of life.


Take the time to do clubs and events outside your immediate social circle. It's fine to invite your best friends to participate in your club's activities. But what if bringing your friends along means that you wouldn't have met another potential friend? Try to meet as many interesting people as possible during your time in college. Don't make friendship an exclusive right shared only by you and your inner circle.

, Be yourself and get in the mood for meeting new people. However, be smart and be cautious. Go with friends and use the buddy system. Be your friend's keeper. Keep an eye on your friend and see if s/he's drinking too much, and ask your friend to keep an eye on you also. Never leave your friend alone, impaired, in an unsafe or unfamiliar environment.


Be a gracious party-goer. Don't litter bottles around someone's room, make a mess in someone's kitchen, or use someone's bed without their permission. Bring cups or soda, or if you're old enough, beer or wine. It's never bad being the person that the host takes a liking to because they're generous and well-mannered.
Be careful about drugs. Know which drugs are likely to harm you and which drugs are milder. (Alcohol and marijuana in moderation aren't likely to put you into the emergency room, but cocaine, meth, hallucinogenic, and painkillers can all be potentially fatal.) Some students find that college is a time to experiment with drugs, but follow your conscience. Don't do anything you're not comfortable doing. In addition, remember that more often than not, you don't know what's in a particular drug.

, Many college-bound freshmen are still alarmingly ignorant about sex. In college, people like to brag about sex. The truth is that college students have sex at a much lower rate than their braggadocio might suggest. One study found that a majority of participants had 1 or fewer sexual partner over the course of a year.Another survey found that 59% of students reported having no sexual partners in the last 30 days.Always use protection. Whether you're a guy or a girl, always keep a condom on you if you're sexually active. If used correctly, a condom is 98% effective in preventing pregnancy.Don't agree on sex unless you or your partner uses protection. Contracting HIV, herpes, or another STI is as easy as having unprotected sex one time. And unlike your excitement, which will fade with time, an STI like herpes won't go away.Understand that alcohol severely impairs your judgment and decision-making skills. Even a small amount of alcohol will decrease your inhibitions, meaning that you'll find it easier to justify having sex with someone you might not have if you were sober.Understand this before you start drinking.
Get straight on the myths about sex. Let's debunk some of the myths about sex:

""The birth control pill protects me from STIs."" Myth. Birth control will not protect you from STIs like HIV/AIDS.""I can't get pregnant if I'm on my period."" Myth. You can absolutely get pregnant when you're on your period.

""I can't get pregnant if I'm a virgin and it's my first time having sex."" Myth. Unfortunately, this is false. You still have a 5% chance of getting pregnant.

""The birth control pill is effective the first day you start taking it."" Myth. It can take up to a month for the birth control pill to become effective.



, (Actually, if you feel like it, eating alone doesn't have to be a bad thing.) Taken from the name of a book by Keith Ferrazzi, the idea is that networking, or making connections that might jumpstart your career at a later date, can be made easy and doesn't have to be a bad thing. Make the most of your opportunities while you're in college. Turn time in the mess hall into a rewarding lesson in personal development.

Eat healthy, exercise, and get enough rest.,
Visit the university health center.,
If your college has a safety department, use it.,
Budget out your expenses.,
Apply for financial aid.,
Look for work-study opportunities.,
If you can, save money.",How to Succeed in College3," All three seem to be on the shortlist for things college students do least. If you want to succeed in college, however, and learn how to balance work, play, and a thousand different things in between, you'll need to start getting serious about your health.


The optimal diet for a college student is the same as it is for everyone else: eat lean meat or protein, fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and stay away from sodas, candy, simple carbohydrates, and saturated fats.Not only will you feel better, but you'll also be in better shape to avoid the infamous freshman 15.

Exercise is a miracle drug, except that it's not really a drug. Exercise helps us burn fat, build muscle, lower cholesterol, ease stress, and sleep better.Join an intramural sports team, do laps in the gym pool, or simply take the stairs instead of the elevator. If you do nothing else, try to get in 30 minutes of walking a day.
Get enough sleep. One of the best ways to maximize academic performance on tests is getting a good night's sleep.In fact, students who pull all nighters, students with sleep disorders, and students who routinely stay up late on weeknights all perform worse in college than students who get regular, comfortable, lasting sleep., The university health center will have all sorts of information about staying healthy on campus, in addition to housing the university's best doctors. Take advantage of the free amenities your health center offers: free vaccines, condoms, and counseling are among the most common.

, Many colleges and universities will have a public safety department that looks after the safety of the university population. Public safety officers will routinely:


Escort you to your home or dorm if you feel unsafe.
Give you valuable safety tips about living in your area (especially applicable in an urban setting).
Investigate crimes that happen on campus. If you've been a victim of a crime, especially robbery, rape, coercion, or assault, please notify the campus security and/or local police.

, College is a time when kids start behaving like grown-ups. Part of being a grown-up is having a budget. To make a budget, take an inventory of the money you'll have during any given month. Look at your past expenses, and budget out how much you'll allow yourself to spend during that month. The expenses should not exceed the amount of money you have. A sample budget might look like this:


Total amount of income per month: $1300.

Housing: $600

Food: $250

Books and school supplies: $100

Gas: $200

Discretionary spending: $150



, Apply for federal student aid, or FAFSAbefore going to college, and check back routinely for new financial aid opportunities. Check with your college's student aid department to find out if you apply for any financial aid or merit-based scholarships. There's a lot of financial aid floating around out there if you know how to find it.

, Your college or university needs employees to function, and it probably knows that giving its students a chance to work is a winning bet. Check with your school about work-study opportunities. Much of the time, you'll get paid to do a mindless, nominal task like man the library entrance. This should also give you opportunities to study while you earn a paycheck.


Other times, the college or university will pay you to perform research with a teacher or department. This is where having a mentor (see above) becomes important. Letters of reference are necessary to convince the department that you are a qualified candidate for the research position. Such positions are extremely competitive, require an excellent academic background and strong letters of reference, and require a great deal of work.

, If you're getting a scholarship or financial aid, or your parents are helping you out with expenses, try as much as possible to save money while you're still in college. After you leave college and become the arbiter of your own life, you'll have to start paying bills. Those bills will be a lot easier to pay if you stored away a little nest egg while you were still in college. Other reasons to save money in college:


Study abroad costs money. Lots of it. If you want to study in Florence, Italy or Shanghai, China, or virtually anywhere else, it's going to cost you a pretty penny. There are scholarships and aid, but you can't always count on them.

Student loans take time to pay off. If you're like most college students, you'll have a lot of loans to pay off once you leave college. Getting them (and the interest payments) paid off can play a huge part in what your budget looks like after you graduate.

Select the school/program that matches your needs.,
Check for instructors that cover subjects/skills you are interested in.,
Contact the program.,
Visit the campus if practical.,
Determine if you can afford it.",How to Return to School in Your Fifties2," If you're trying to gain employment or change jobs, make sure whatever school you select will have programs that fulfill those requirements. There are several news magazines that have school rankings, but it's best to make sure the one you pick actually has a department and faculty that cover what you want to do. A local college in your area may be just as suitable for business training and far easier on your schedule than a national university. In your 50s, you want to pick a school that is going to meet your lifestyle needs.
Consider vocational/community colleges for an associate degree or certificate training. These are usually faster degrees, approximately one or two years of course work depending on your class load. If you are in your 50s, this may be a better option especially if you're already working or need to return to the workforce sooner. Thoroughly explore the website/program listings of the colleges you're interested in. See if they have classes you can use. Be aware that sometimes classes on the books are not always offered every semester.

, Whatever type of school you select, within your program's department, most colleges will have a specific department page along with specific faculty pages within each department. Look up the professors/instructors credentials to see if they have sufficient background in the fields you're going to study.
Most faculty should have a curriculum vitae, the academic version of the résumé, available. See if they have at least some publications, teaching experience, and/or work experience in the areas you are pursuing.

, It's a good idea to e-mail or call the program you're interested in to make sure they will accommodate adult learners and flexible scheduling. This is a good opportunity to also find out about degree requirement details beyond what's listed on the program website.


Be polite, and remember you are likely one of many students contacting this individual or office on any given day.
This may be a good time to inform your program contact that you are an adult learner. In your 50s, you might be able to contribute experience and knowledge to the program beyond the traditional student--something you could bring up if applicable.
You should consider coming up with questions before-hand--especially about the program of study, degree requirements, and schedule options.
If you are uncertain if you are dealing with Ph.D.s (doctor of philosophy), you should address the faculty members as ""Professor.""

, If you can arrange a physical visit to the school, that would go a long way to improving your chances of attending classes in person. Not counting online schools/classes--a campus tour is usually available at most colleges/universities at regular intervals. Contact your prospective college's main office for more information.

, This is a significant factor in going to any college regardless of age. If you are already employed, your employer may provide funding for some specific educational training. Otherwise, you will have to find other financial means. Besides paying out of pocket--there are Federal loans, private loans, grants, scholarships, and work-study programs. Fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) . All Federal financial aid eligibility is determined first through FAFSA. It can be completed as early as January 1st of the year leading up to enrollment (so for students entering school that same Fall/Spring). The earlier it's completed, the better your chances for funding.
There are several other types of specialized aid including for the military, AmeriCorps volunteers, education tax credits, foster care youths, etc... available through the U.S. government's official site: Grants and scholarships will require you to apply to specific groups, usually with thematic projects in mind. They will provide funding over a specific term--frequently 1 or 2 semesters--and expect some manner of academic achievement from you in return. This will vary from program to program.
Work-study, as the name suggests, pairs the student with employers in exchange for direct funding to scholastic needs. As a person in their 50s, you will have a great deal of experience to offer for this option.

Create a routine.,
Go to class.,
Participate!,
Get help when you need it.,
Maintain your health.",How to Return to School in Your Fifties3," Once you select a college, program, and classes, your class schedule will loom large in your daily and weekly life. Figure out how much time you need for any reading, writing, homework, etc... on a regular basis and set that time aside from your other daily duties.


If you have family and work tasks, you might let your family members and co-workers/employer know of your educational needs and arrange changes in transportation, completion of chores, shift assignments, etc... In your 50s, this will likely be among your most difficult challenges upon going back to school. Using scheduling tools, electronic or written, may be a good idea.
Be prepared to adjust this task balance semester to semester as class schedules change.
If it's ever a challenge to meet your scholastic requirements, then talk to your professor(s) to see if you can reach some alternate arrangement about your workload or schedule. Don't wait, do this as early in a semester as possible.

, Whether it's physical or online, there's no substitute for attending class. Taking notes, participating in discussion, and getting feedback are unique experiences each and every class. You should come prepared to most classes for a mix of lecture and discussion, though every professor's style will vary.

, If the class turns into a discussion or professor is asking a question you know enough content about to answer--raise your hand or submit to the forum (for online classes).


Taking part in a class full of 20-somethings can be intimidating in your 50s. But remember, you're there to learn just as much as they are. And they may benefit from your life and work experiences out of the classroom.

, Don't be afraid to ask your professor/instructor for assistance if you're struggling with a concept or any other aspect of your classwork.


See them during office hours and as early in the semester as possible to avoid problems. If you cannot make their office hours, you can usually contact them for appointments at other times.
If you need additional tutoring, many colleges have tutoring centers for each subject field. If you can't physically make it to the tutoring center, the college may be able to give you contact information of reliable ones you can hire for help.
Take advantage of study groups formed by others in your classes, even if they are younger than you.

, Whether you're in your 50s or 20s, keeping up your health is essential for a successful academic term.


Eat healthy. Keeping up a sensible daily eating regimen is a good idea for energy and alertness during classes, and during studying. It's easy to forget to eat when in the middle of an assignment or juggling class times. This issue is no less important in your 50s.
Exercise. Some regular physical activity will help with energy, alertness, and maintaining focus for assignments and classwork--half an hour of jogging or similar activity each day.
Take breaks. Take 15-20 minute breaks for every hour or two of work you're doing on studying. This will help rest your eyes from being strained, avoid headaches, and give your mind a chance to refocus on the material you're handling.

Celebrate!",How to Succeed As a Non Traditional College Student," Many of us who are first generation college students have been told, both directly and indirectly, that we are not college material. It’s simply not true. If you have the desire to go back to school and get a college education, and if you are determined to make it happen, then you are definitely college material. Your first step toward a college degree is to believe in yourself and your ability to succeed.;
, Everyone needs support to make it through college. Traditionally, college was reserved for the elite, who were taught all they needed to know about higher education by their families and the exclusive secondary schools they attended. Students from high schools in wealthier neighborhoods are far better prepared than students from non-privileged inner city and rural schools. That does not mean that you can’t succeed if you did not come from a well-educated and wealthy family. It does mean that you will need to seek out resources and create your own support network.

, Start by avoiding people who are negative about your goals and surround yourself with people who are supportive of your aspirations. If that means moving several miles away (or even several hundred miles away) do it! You’ll have enough on your plate just combating the voice in your head that replays the negative messages you’ve received prior to this decision. You don’t need to hear negativity anymore. You need to fill your life with people who encourage and inspire you. Schools do want you to be successful, because if you aren’t successful you will drop out and they will lose funding. Also, they have to report their retention rates, and low retention rates cause them to have lower ratings among their peers which further affects funding and enrollment. Therefore, colleges and universities have created numerous resources to help you succeed right on campus. Go check them out. Women’s centers, cultural centers, LGBTQ centers, writing centers, math centers, learning centers, counseling centers, financial aid offices, etc. are all committed to helping you succeed. These centers are great places to start your journey to higher education and to building a support network.

, You’ll want to make sure these centers are staffed with people who greet you warmly, recognize you as an individual, and are knowledgeable about other resources on campus (even if that means telling you, “I don’t know, but I’ll be happy to look into it and get back to you”).


Don’t just go to one center; go in and at least check out ALL of them. Create relationships with the people who staff these centers. They are likely to be your strongest and most reliable supporters. If you don’t find that the campus you’ve visited has centers like the ones described go to a different campus. There will come a time when you will hit a wall, and you will be much more likely to find solutions if you have already established relationships with individuals on campus who are trained to keep up on all of the college and community resources available to students. Centers such as these are packed with people who are eager to help.

, Take every available assessment and find out what career fields are best suited to your interests, personality, and preferences. You can always gain skills. Make sure the education and skills you are working to build will lead to a career you will LOVE! Once you have an idea of where you might like to work, schedule a working interview and a job shadow. Arrange to volunteer. Get some hands on experience that will let you know for sure what the day-in and day-out duties are. Ask people who hire for that position what you need to do to become an excellent candidate. Is there a particular practicum or internship (essentially the same thing) that will look better on a resume? Are there classes, clubs, organizations that will help you? Plan all of this out in advance. After all, no matter how much you love to learn, you want the education so that you can get into a career field you will love, right?

, The people in these offices can help you with letters of intent and applications for grants and scholarships. Do your best with forms you need to fill out and letters or essays you need to write, then go to the appropriate office and ask them to proof-read it for you. Their assistance can help you pull together a solid application. Be sure to ask if there is anything else you should include.

, It is always okay to ask who else might be knowledgeable about your concern. There is always someone who has more information. Even if you think you have good answers, it doesn’t hurt to ask for a second opinion. You may be surprised by the amount of useful advice is available. If you find that most of the people you talk with at a particular college or university are not particularly helpful, look elsewhere. The importance of attending an institution that is responsive to your needs cannot be overstated. Are you beginning to notice a theme?

, These classes will help you in every other class you take. Take them early and take them even if you think you don’t need them. There are always new ideas that will help you study more efficiently, design more effective visuals for a presentation, or write a better paper. If you only get one tip out of a 10 week course that helps you knock two hours’ worth of study time off each of the dozens of research papers that are in your future, then it was well worth sitting through the rest of the course.

, They are your lifelines for each course you take. Do not just glance at it and throw it away. A good syllabus will tell you exactly how to get an A in the class. Follow it closely and refer to it often.

, In your first week, take all of your syllabi out and look at the assignments that will be due over the course of the term. Now plot them on your calendar. Do three of your four classes require weekly reflection papers? Make time for them and spread them out over the course of the week. If they are all due on Fridays, don’t try to get them all done on Thursday night. You might do all of your readings and reflection paper for one class on Saturday, another on Sunday and the third by Wednesday. When you give yourself an extra day for each assignment that is due, you won’t have to freak out when life happens and you aren’t able to read a single page on Thursday. If you are a working adult with kids, you know these setbacks are sure to happen on a regular basis. Plan a cushion into your schedule whenever possible so that you can prove yourself as a reliable student. That way, when something big comes up (like a death in the family or an extended illness) your instructors will be willing to work with you, knowing that you are not frequently asking for extensions.

, Research papers should be written over the course of the term, not in the last week. If your calendar looks to full for comfort, cut back NOW! It is much better to take 6 credits and do well, than to take 12 credits and barely get by. Everything will suffer if you take on too much. As long as you keep taking classes you WILL graduate. Even if you can only take one class per term you will make progress.

, As you read the syllabi, look for the emphasis each instructor places on various aspects of your grade. A good syllabus will let you know if the instructor is more concerned with punctuation or critical thinking, participation or number of pages written, quality of academic sources or specific citation formats. Take notes. Remind yourself on every assignment what this particular instructor is basing your grade on. Make sure you adjust your priorities to match theirs. Then take your completed work to the writing center for revisions before submitting them in class. Again, this will take planning. You will need to give yourself time to make an appointment and do a revision. Ideally, find a student who has done well in the course you are taking (from the same instructor) and ask them to review your work.

, Always write a first draft as soon as possible. Set it aside and work on something else (preferably something completely different). Come back to it at least a day later. You’ll be surprised at how many mistakes you catch, or awkward phrases you decide to revise. Once you’ve revised your rough draft, ask a colleague to proof-read it (someone who is familiar with the class and the instructor’s requirements). Then go to the writing center for further revisions. Your chances for an A will dramatically improve by following this schedule.

, Study groups can be wonderful support networks. Just talking about a course with a group of friends can help you to internalize course concepts and prepare you to speak and write about them more articulately. A study group can also serve as proof-readers for those written assignments that should NEVER be turned in without revisions. If you do serve as proof-readers for each other, try to make it so that every person proofs at least three papers. That way you will each have feedback from three classmates. Drill each other on facts. Support each other by keeping the focus on the course (you can gossip/flirt/talk about the game later if you wish), and by celebrating each other’s triumphs. Meet regularly (perhaps each week before or after class).

, Most instructors are happy to make time for you and disappointed that so few students come to them during office hours. Showing up to introduce yourself at the beginning of the term, asking for clarification on assignments, and even asking your instructor to review an assignment are all ways to let your instructor know that you are serious about your education. Besides being a great way to ensure you understand what is expected of you, this will go a long way if you get a poor grade on an assignment. Often, your instructor will allow you to revise and resubmit if they have already witnessed your level of dedication and enthusiasm for the course.

, Give yourself incentives for all of the little steps along the way to celebrate small accomplishments. Make these incentives as healthy as possible and try to make them fun! Keep a list of small and large rewards for a variety of celebrations. Just finished an hour of studying flashcards? Reward yourself with a walk in the park. Completed a difficult term? Spend a day at the beach. Earned your B.A.? Go to Jamaica! Get the picture? It is easy to lose sight of all the little things we do, but if we learn to celebrate little accomplishments it energizes us and propels us forward so that we can celebrate big accomplishments.

Place the bonnet firmly on your head.,
Ensure the tassel on the cap is on the right side of your face.",How to Put on Academic Robes for a Graduation Ceremony," Your graduation is considered a formal event, so you are expected to wear formal dress under your gown. Before you put on your gown, check that your outfit is appropriate for graduation.For men, this could be pressed slacks or dress pants and a collared shirt or tie.
For women, this could be a formal dress and heels, or pressed slacks, a blouse, and dress flats.;
, Your gown style will depend on the academic level you are graduating with. There are three levels:


Bachelor’s degree: The gown style for Associate’s and Bachelor’s degrees are of the same design. The gown has open, pointed sleeves and is designed to be worn closed. The gown will fall no lower than your mid-calf.Bachelor’s gowns are generally black and Associate’s gowns can be black or in a color lighter than black.
Master’s degree: The style of Master’s degree gowns feature oblong sleeves, open at the wrist. The oblong shape is square cut in the black and the front section has an arc cut.Though you may be more comfortable wearing your gown closed, academic protocol allows the gown to be worn open or closed.
Doctoral degree: These gowns have three velvet bars on each sleeve and one vertical panel down each side of the gown on each side of the gown opening. The velvet panels and bars are generally black, but may be in the color representing your degree. The gown has bell-shaped sleeves and can be worn open or closed.Gown modifications: Many colleges and universities have adopted modifications to the traditional design to make them specific to the institution. Modifications may include a gown color other than black, colored piping around the velvet panels, special trim, and embroidered patches with the degree color on the gown. For example, Boston University uses a red gown with a black trim, and Harvard University uses a black gown with embroidered patches in the degree color placed at the chest level.

, Though there will be slits on both sides of the gown, do not slide your arms through just the slits. Your arms should go through the sleeves and the gown should hang off your shoulders.Master’s and Doctoral degree gowns may have a slit on either side, instead of a full sleeve. If so, slide your arms through the slits.

, The back of the garment should be resting close to the nape of your neck.


The robe may slip during the ceremony or as you are on the stage preparing to accept your degree. Be sure to check that it is sitting straight on your shoulders. If it is lopsided or slipping, lift the gown and pull it forward so it is sitting properly before you walk out on stage.

, Depending on your degree level, the cut and style of your hood will fluctuate in size and cut.The Bachelor’s hood is about three feet long, has a black fabric shell, and a satin lining. Most Bachelor’s hoods are “Oxford Burgon cut”, which are lined on the inside with satin fabric in the color associated with your discipline or university.
The Master’s hood is three and a half feet long, has a black fabric shell, and a satin lining.
The Doctoral hood is four feet long, has a black fabric shell, and a satin lining.
The Master’s hood and the Doctoral hood are usually designed to lie flat against your back, making it easier to stay in position when worn. Most Master’s and Doctoral hoods will have a black shell, with velvet trim that extends around your neck, over your shoulders, and down your back.

, Though there are standard colors for each department or discipline (such as green for Medicine, dark blue for Philosophy, and purple for Law), your institution will determine what color your discipline receives.The chosen color for your discipline will be featured on the edge of your hood. In the case of a Master’s or Doctoral hood, the colored satin will be on the back portion of the hood, by the velvet stripe.

, The point of the hood should be pointing towards the ground. It should be all black on the outside when you open it.The tip of the hood will drape down your back. The “V” section of the hood will sit on your chest. The opening of the hood will rest on your shoulders.
Note that some universities hood their Master’s and Doctor’s graduates on stage. If you are a Master’s or Doctoral graduate, you may not have a hood until the graduation ceremony.

, The “V” section should sit across your chest. Do not put your arms through the “V”. Just your head and chest area should be covered by the hood., You may need to ask someone for assistance for this step. A thin line of color should be visible around your neck. You should also turn the hood outward at your back so the colored satin line is visible at the back.If the hood starts to slip or turn inward, use safety pins to keep it in place against your robe.

, There are two types of caps, depending on your academic level:Bachelor’s and Master’s graduates will wear a style called a trencher or mortarboard. The trencher will be made of solid black felt, with a flat square top and a black silk tassel. The square top will sit on an oval cap that has a small point in the front and a large point in the back.
Doctoral graduates will wear a bonnet style cap. The bonnet will be made of black velvet, with a tassel and a cord in the color of your discipline or institution.

, For Bachelor’s and Master’s graduates, adjust the trencher on your head so the small point is at the front of your head and the large point is at the back of your head.

, For Doctoral graduates, put the bonnet on your head so it sits snugly and evenly on your head.

, For Bachelor’s, Master’s, and Doctoral graduates, the tassel on the trencher or bonnet should always be on the right side. You will enter the ceremony with the tassel on the right side and change it to the left side once you receive your degree."

Find the universities or colleges that interest you.,
If you prefer to search by book, there are also publications available in good libraries that detail the available universities and colleges worldwide, along with contact details, specializations, points of interest, etc.,
Look at the university's own website.,
Look for comparison sites.,
Check out reviews of universities and colleges.,
Visit the university or college.,
Send away for literature.",How to Research a University," If you're not sure which university will suit you, begin at the beginning. Look for universities worldwide using a searchable database of universities around the world, such as Universities Worldwide, Brain Track College and University Directory, etc. Note that these sites are provided to help you, this is not an endorsement of them or any other site - do your own investigations.;
, If you don't know where to start, ask for help from a librarian.

, Once you've chosen some universities or colleges that interest you, go to their own homepage online and start looking through the key data. Good areas to look include the information for prospective students, history of the university, courses offered, key highlights of the educational programs offered, etc.

, There are quite a number of these. Some are country dependent, others take a more international focus. Do a search using words such as ""university/college comparisons"", ""compare universities/colleges"", etc. These will give you some feedback on people's impressions of the strengths and weaknesses of courses etc. offered at the various universities and colleges.

, Newspapers and current affairs magazines often do yearly reviews of how the universities and colleges are faring in your country. If you know the publications, search those direct, otherwise use the search engine to help you locate such reviews. Or, ask a librarian for help!

, If you live near the one you're interested in, go and visit it and see what it is like, visit its library and do some research by reading their literature, asking questions of current students and staff, etc.

, When you've narrowed down the universities and colleges of interest to you, request their information packs. This will include a lot of sales pitch, so don't forget to also rely on your background research of reviews, word-of-mouth, and comparisons to help you reach your decision about the quality of education offered and the quality of the institution as a whole.

Determine how many credit hours you should take.,
Decide which curriculum requirements to focus on this semester.,
Think about fulfilling your general education requirements.,
Focus on your major.,
Round out your schedule with electives that interest you.,
Talk to your advisor.,
Find out if you qualify for any course exemptions.,
Find your college’s class bulletin.,
Research the classes you are interested in.,
Think about what days and times you would like to take classes.,
Register as soon as you can.,
Don’t stress if you can’t get into a class.,
Consider online courses.",How to Register for College Classes," Full time students often take between twelve and sixteen credit hours per semester, and many (though not all) classes are three credits each.


So you would need to take four classes (four classes x three hours each) to reach a full time status of twelve credit hours.;
, There are a few course categories that you will need to fulfill to graduate, and you should keep in mind timing when planning your semesters. You don’t have to have your entire college career set in stone, but getting an idea of what you need to accomplish in the next four years will help you decide what to take each semester.


Most schools have planning worksheets available. This will allow you to see the big picture when thinking about what classes to take right now.
Having some idea of what you need to graduate will help you avoid wasting time on classes that don’t count toward your degree.

, General education (or ""gen ed"" or ""core"") classes are required of all students. They will be across a variety of disciplines, such as math, language, history, and science, and will be introductory. Gen ed courses will give you a broad intellectual foundation by exposing you to a variety of disciplines (whether you like them all or not!) and will make you a well-rounded student. If you are unsure of your major, this sampling of departments might help you decide which subject to pursue.Focus on taking these classes in your freshman and sophomore years.
These typically have lower course numbers, such as English 101.
Try to avoid putting off these classes, even if you are uninterested or find the subject difficult. Passing these classes, called prerequisites, will often be required to move on to other specific courses later.

, Once you have determined your major, you will take a series of specialized courses in that discipline or department. These courses will usually relate to whatever you want to do after graduation, whether that means beginning a job in your chosen field or going on to graduate school. So if you want to become a marine biologist, you will concentrate on courses in the sciences to prime you for that career.Generally, you will move on to these upper-division classes once you’ve completed most or all of your gen ed requirements, roughly around the end of your sophomore year or beginning of your junior year. So you’ll need to declare a major at that point, if you haven’t done so already.
In most departments, there will be requirements for the major, so you will have to take particular classes. For instance, a History major might be required to take at least one class in American history, European history, and African history.
Many majors require a capstone course, taken in your senior year and required for graduation, which will give you a chance to show off all you learned as a major.
These courses might have higher numbers like History 440.

, Most programs offer the opportunity for you to choose a number of classes simply because you are interested in them. They may be in any discipline and give you a chance to explore and have fun with your schedule.You will have time for electives once you complete your gen ed classes.
Electives can compliment your major, or if you concentrate on a secondary discipline, they can form your minor. But if an Art class in comic book illustration doesn’t relate to your program requirements, it’s ok because you can take it as an elective!

, Your advisor is your best friend! Most schools will have counselors available to help students plan their programs each semester. Even if you are confident in your choice of courses, running your plan by a knowledgeable advisor can ensure that you haven’t missed something.


If you have chosen a major, your advisor may be in your department. If not, you can talk to an advisor in student services. Contact your department secretary to find out if you have an assigned advisor.
Meet with your advisor regularly so that you stay on track to graduation. You don’t want to get to the end of your senior year only to find out you forgot to take a required class.
Some advisors have drop in hours. But to be on the safe side, call or email to make an appointment. Arrive on time, with a list of questions and some idea of what you would like to take.

, You may not have to take all of your required courses, particularly at the gen ed level. The registrar is the campus office that handles all things related to registration. Contact them to see if you qualify for an exemption and to be sure these credits are on your record.


If you took AP or IB exams, you may be exempt from some requirements.
You may be able to test out of certain courses, such as foreign language, if you get a high enough score on a placement test.
If you took classes at another college, you may be able to transfer some credits.

, Before registration begins, locate the list of courses that are available for the upcoming semester. It’s very important to note which classes are offered this particular semester. Freshman often decide what classes they would like to take without realizing that many are only offered at certain times of year, or even every few years.


Note if one of your preferred course has a prerequisite, which is a lower-level class that you are required to pass before you can move on to another.

, Don’t just go by the course title. Check out the course catalog, which will have descriptions of each class that is offered at that university.


Much of your classroom experience will be based on your professor. Ask upperclassmen for recommendations on which professors they had good experiences with. You can also check out ratemyprofessor.com for reviews.

, Now that you have an idea of what courses you would like to take, consider your work schedule, extracurricular activities, and social time when planning your semester.


If you work on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, it might be hard to get up for an 8am class on Wednesdays and Fridays.
You should also note where on campus your chosen classes are located. You may not want to race to the other side of campus in between classes.

, It’s important not to delay signing up for classes, because some may fill up fast. Often students will be assigned a registration start date. Be sure to know when you are allowed to register.

, This is bound to happen at some point, so be sure to have a few back-ups in mind when you register.


If you don’t get in to a class you really want or need to take, find out if it will be offered again sometime soon. If not, keep an eye on registration in the first week or so of the semester, when students are allowed to add or drop classes without penalty.
In some cases, professors are willing to over cap, or open up seats, to a small number of students after the class has filled. Contact the professor directly to inquire about this possibility, but don’t count on it and don’t beg.

, Online classes might be an option for fulfilling your requirements conveniently. These days, many schools offer courses that are partly or entirely online. These are a viable choice when students have work or family commitments that are hard to schedule around, or when they are in the military.


Online learning requires a lot of self-discipline, since you’d be responsible for getting the coursework done on your own time, without as much supervision as a traditional class.
You will have less personal interaction with your professor and classmates, and might not be able to build as many relationships as you would in a classroom. So you might want to avoid online classes if you are a particularly social person.

, If you enjoyed maintaining the company website at your last job, you may also enjoy taking some online classes in graphic design and web design.

, What were your favorite subjects and hobbies? What did you want to be when you grew up? Does what you do now have anything to do with those subjects, hobbies and dreams?

, You don't have to decide ""what you want to be when you grow up"" right away.

, Set aside the time to do the homework - make yourself into a role model for the kids. Do homework together. Set up a study centre in your home or track everyone down to the local library for an afternoon of study.

, Not everything has to be done perfectly - you will give yourself ulcers. Do the best you can and learn from the feedback given to you by your teachers. Your home will survive the odd bit of dust.

Discover opportunities to share school projects by putting student work online.,
Avoid problems and risks to students by exercising caution whenever you decide to put student work online.,
Consider using Internet safety filters and blockers to help protect your students from accessing undesirable websites.",How to Put Student Work Online," Often the idea of having their work on the Internet motivates students to be more creative and productive.


Look for student publishing websites that feature various areas of the curriculum such as art, literature, math, and science. There are many legitimate safe websites that exist to promote student work, some involving contests which can further motivate students to participate. There are also sites, for instance, which encourage students to nominate people in the community as heroes or ones which allow kids to share stories and information about their pets.
Create your own class or school website where the students can upload their work. You can post information about any class project with which you are involved, giving the community a view into your classroom. There are many tools available to educators which teach how to design a web page.;
,


Always get parental permission to post their child's work on the Internet. Involve the parents with the projects and encourage them to check on any posting their child makes.
Teach your students how to use the Internet safely. Many schools have an acceptable use policy (AUP) which students and teachers must strictly follow. All parties involved in any online project must be made aware of this policy, including teachers, students, parents and administrators.
Many schools have a policy of not posting students' full names. Sometimes a first name is used or many prefer to use nicknames. This policy protects students and helps ensure their privacy.
Before posting any student pictures, get parental permission. Since it is most likely that parents already have signed permission slips to have their child's photo printed in the local or school newspaper, it would be easy to add permission for online posting of pictures as well.
Make sure students realize from the beginning that all content must be school related and not have a social agenda. Monitor whatever your students place on the Internet. Check frequently to be sure the material they upload or post is appropriate. Comment on their work to let them know you are keeping an eye on things. Encourage parents and others in the school to be vigilant as well.

If you are deciding to go to college, the first goal is to ask yourself, ""Will I finish what I start?,Upon entering school, you need to decide if you are going to be a good student, an A student, or just a student that squeaks by to get that degree

,

Take one subject at a time and balance the homework accordingly.,
Don't ever compare yourself to others.,
Remember, learning can be fun.,
Most importantly, never give up.",How to Remain in College With a Positive Attitude,""";
,, You will need to sit down with your family, and discuss this aspect before you decide which college you will be attending. My suggestion is that if you have to pay for college yourself, try taking your general credits at a community college, then go on to a university or technical school to finish your degree. The more money you save, the less stressed you will be about your loans, and the more you can concentrate on the material.

, Try going to a school counselor to decide what your major will be in. If you already know, take classes based on your degree.

, Write down all due-dates for assignments, phone numbers and emails of your teachers and students you may know, and any information that may help you be more organized.

, I know sometimes the stress may be overwhelming because of picking your classes to go along with your work schedule, the traffic to get to school after work, the time consuming homework, the long lines at the bookstore, the difficult tests, the burden of being away from your family and much much more. My suggestion is to limit your stress in any way you can. Breathe.

, Take a warm bath to gather your thoughts and try to think about the positive aspects of college and don't dwell on the negative aspects with a negative attitude. Look at life and college as a positive experience.

,,, This causes you to be more connected to your school life. Have study groups to help with tests and homework.

, Even if you have to do a little each day, it's a whole lot better than doing nothing. It's a great feeling of accomplishment when you write an A paper or get an A for an Econ test.

, This experience is an individual experience. You are doing this for yourself and by yourself. This is your personal race to become better. Take your time if you have to.

, Take the time to learn the material. In the long run, you will expand your knowledge. Never stop learning, even after college ends.

, Life happens, accidents happen, if you find yourself in a difficult predicament and have to take time off of college, take that time, but always go back and finish what you start! It's a strong feeling of accomplishment once you finish and you will be exceptionally proud of yourself for doing so.

Be fully aware that future careers do change for many, even in college, so don't harvest yourself on a specific goal.;
, Many to all colleges prefer students to succeed and have the standard subjects, such as math, literature, history, and science for the ""base"" degree. More higher technical degrees then unravel into more specifics in each subject, depending on which path one wishes to follow.

, Work with them to pinpoint what school courses to take and pass to fit those college subjects the best. Sift through the selections of high school electives that match with the specific degree that you are going for.


Ask your counselor if you can fit in college prep, advanced placement classes, etc. Know that you may need to take exams or have prerequisites.

, Colleges want people whom will involve themselves in their school and has shown dedication in the past. Extracurricular activities doesn't need to be specifically in school. Search for clubs or volunteer work around your local town. Listing down these things, how long you have been doing them, etc will show the college(s) that you have the ability to manage your time with other events aside from homework.

, Your cumulative GPA (grade point average) is very important for colleges, as each one requires a minimum in order to enter or be accepted.

, On average, there's about 25-35 students per teacher in a high school class. However, in college, it will exceed between 25 to 100+ per professor. Classes are done in any given environment, whether it's in actual science laboratory or auditorium. If you do not pay attention in school, it would be wise to adjust your listening and note taking skills early, as the professor will talk quickly and won't be able to say something twice. Most college students bring tape recorders or laptops to type out notes on.

, Outline their requirements and any prerequisites that you might need. Ask around your family and friends on their experiences with college (or community college). This is also the time to start thinking and planning out financial needs. Determine and sketch up your plans:

Where are you residing? Are you planning to team up with friends for rent, stay with your parents/guardians, or residing on campus. Know that residing on campus always requires housing and meals.






Tuition and fees. Normally, colleges and universities determine tuition based on the amount of credits you are planning to take. There are specialty courses that have their own payment, as well as sub-courses.






Books. Unlike high school where books are provided to you with ease, each college professor requires you to get specific textbooks and other necessary items. You might discover that paying for books is higher than one can believe; so try to plan on purchasing used books, which can be purchased online or through previous students. You might even be treasured by friends or siblings whom have taken those courses and achieve free books.







Financial aid and scholarships. Financial aid for college gives a lift to budgets and assists you greatly. Most programs requires you to maintain a minimum grade point average to retain them. Apply for scholarships early.







, A lot of high schools have you take these either in your junior or senior year and most colleges accepts at least one of them as a requirement. Know that you must pass with a certain score on them, for certain degrees.

, Get to know the structures, buildings, admission, parking areas, any housing placements. Take advance of any tours provided by the college(s). Pick up any admission or information packets while you are there.

, Don't apply to colleges that do not appeal to you, might exceed your experiences/goals, etc. Over half of the students typically find themselves going to college in a different state than their home. Note that most to all colleges have application deadlines, so be sure to have everything organized and ready. This is the time to prove on paper to them why you wish to attend the college, what activities you have done, and so forth. Always keep a copy for yourself for each application to avoid any stress if anything gets misplaced, etc. It will just be one less thing to worry about.

Look at feeder schools. Many graduate schools, including law schools, have close traditional relationships with some undergraduate universities. Attending a preferred undergraduate school is one avenue to getting a degree that a prospective law school will recognize and respect.Most law schools are directly affiliated with a university, both public and private. For example, the McGeorge Law School, home of Justice Anthony Kennedy, is affiliated with University of the Pacific, a private school in Stockton, California. The University of Kansas School of Law school is located on the KU campus in Lawrence, Kansas. If you attend an affiliated undergraduate school, there may be an expedited application process, transcript submission, and seamless financial aid procedures to the law school.;
, An undergraduate degree from a prestigious university may look good on your resume, but taking a huge load of student debt into graduate school may negate some of the advantages of that degree. Graduating from a state college is often a good way to keep your student debt manageable. Balance costs with reputation to get the best value for your tuition dollar.Minimizing your student debt will give you the best options on graduation. You can look at internships and low-pay opportunities for experience rather than worrying about finding an immediate job.

, The American Bar Association (ABA) does not recommend any specific degree of course of study before you attend law school.The only requirement to apply to law school is a four-year degree from an accredited university.


Take classes that challenge and develop your analytical and critical thinking skills. A broad liberal arts education in history, language, art, literature, and philosophy will give you the broad base of education that will help you succeed in law school.Take classes that you will not only enjoy, but also that you will excel in. Your undergraduate grade point average (GPA) is a critical factor in law school admissions.The sole exception is if your goal is to practice patent law. In order to qualify to apply for admittance to the Patent Bar, you must have an undergraduate degree in hard science. Typical patent attorneys have backgrounds in engineering, medicine, nursing, chemistry, biology, or computer science., Some schools try to push prospective law students into prescribed pre-law study tracks. However, statistics show that degrees heavy in philosophy, economics, and journalism have higher law school acceptance rates than majors in criminal justice and political science.Courses of study that include languages, perhaps with a study abroad component, both increases your skills and world view. Trying to jumpstart your legal coursework with classes in real property or torts only limits the diversity in your education.

, All law schools offer the Juris Doctor degree (JD).However, many law schools offer specialties and certificate programs in subjects ranging from the Tulane Maritime Law Programto the Certificate in Native American Law at the University of Tulsa College of Law.By matching your interests, background, and life experience with a course of study, you may enhance your chances of being admitted to the law school of your choice.

, Your GPA is the most important goal in your undergraduate work. However, take advantage of activities on campus to enhance your qualifications, diversify your interests, and show your motivation to excel in non-academic as well as academic pursuits. If you are athletically inclined, consider going out for an individual or team sport. Other college activities that can enhance your skills are tutoring, peer counseling programs, and non-profits such as Habitat for Humanity., Law schools could fill every first year class with straight-A GPAs and high LSAT scores. However, admissions committees want to balance the class with students of diverse experiences. Consider summer volunteer work and internships that allow you to develop communication skills and a record of public service.Examples include working for a food pantry, political campaign, or environmental project.


Expanding your horizons also puts you in a good position to seek reference letters from supervisors and community leaders.

, The Law School Admission Test (LSAT) is near legend among prospective law students. Understanding the purpose and structure of the exam can help you calm your fears and get the score you need to help you enter the law school of your choice.


The test is not about law. The LSAT assesses your competence in skills that you need to successfully complete law school. You will be tested on reading comprehension, your analytical reasoning skills, and your grasp of logic.The LSAT is a 3.5 hour examination. There are five multiple-choice sections of which four will be scored. There is also a 35-minute writing sample that is sent with your law school application package., The exam is held four times per year on a Saturday. There are three alternate test dates for those who observe the Sabbath on Saturday and one Spanish-language test session.The deadline to register for the exam is approximately five weeks before the test date. Check the calendar on the Law School Admission Council (LSAC) website for registration deadlines.The exam is offered at regular testing centers. You may take the test at any center, regardless of the state or city where you went to college or want to attend law school.You can take the LSAT in either the June or December session immediately before you intend to start law school. If you are in college, this would be the June before the first semester of your senior year or the December before your final semester. If you take the test in June, you can repeat it in December if you would like to try and increase your score.The current fee to register for the LSAT is $175, payable in US dollars. Fees must be paid with a major credit or debit card. If you meet the low income criteria as established by LSAC, you may be able to have the fee waived for two LSAT exams. You must apply for a fee waiver at least six weeks before the registration deadline.To register to take the LSAT, you must create an online account with LSAC. This account will be used for test registration, receiving LSAT scores, and as a method of submitting online applications to law schools., The best preparation for the exam is to familiarize yourself with the style of the questions and to practice working under the tight time constraints. The LSAC offers several sample tests free of charge.You can also purchase LSAT study guides through the LSAC bookstore.Your college may also offer test prep classes and study sessions. There is no right or wrong way to prepare for the exam. Use the method that works best for you., You will receive your LSAT score by email and regular mail about a month after the exam. There is no pass or fail. You will fall on a range of 120 to 180.The higher your score, the more competitive your application will be at the law school of your choice. For example, if you have your sights set on Harvard, you will need to aim for an LSAT score of around 170. Each law school will publish statistics about the median LSAT scores for previous classes.A lower LSAT score can be balanced with a stellar GPA. Don't let an LSAT score in the 150 to 160 range stop you from applying to the school of your choice. Just know that you will have to have other qualifications to balance it out.
Once you have your LSAT scores you can start looking at early application to law schools. Final admission may depend on your final GPA, so don't slack off in your last semester. Aim for a strong run to graduation to finish your preparation for law school.

Warm the heavy cream to room temperature.,
Prepare the food processor.,
Place the cream in the bowl of the food processor.,
If you like your butter salty, add salt to taste.,
Turn on the food processor to churn the butter, preferably at low speed.,
Drain the buttermilk.,
Squeeze any remaining buttermilk from the butter.,
Place the butter into a container.,
Cool in the refrigerator.",How to Make Butter With a Food Processor," You can leave it in the container while it warms, or in a large bowl.
, Wash and dry the food processor bowl and blade before you begin., Add any other ingredients you wish to use if you are making fancy butter, such as garlic, parsley, cumin, curry powder or other spices to suit your taste. Keep in mind, however, that if you put spices into the cream, they will also transfer to the buttermilk and your pancakes and feline friends may not like that.

Do not overfill the food processor bowl, otherwise the cream may spill out during churning.

, A teaspoon of salt per pint of cream is usually enough. If you like your butter unsalted, omit the salt., Watch as the cream solids separate and congeal into butter. It should take no more than two or three minutes.

The cream will go through stages, usually indicated by changes in the sound coming from the food processor bowl. First it turns very creamy and looks like ice cream. The churning noise will become rougher, and the cream will abruptly turn solid when the butter separates from the buttermilk.
Stop the food processor and taste it. If it tastes like butter, you're done.
If it still tastes like sweet cream, run it another one or two minutes.

, The liquid that remains after the butter congeals is fresh buttermilk that can be used in any recipe that calls for it.,


Wash your hands thoroughly.
Fold a large piece of cheesecloth in half and place the butter in the middle. Fold the sides up into a bag.
While holding the closed end of the bag with one hand, knead and squeeze the butter to force out any remaining buttermilk. This step is important––if you don't remove as much of the buttermilk as you can, the butter may turn rancid in one or two days.


, A bowl or square mold will do. Press it down firmly with a large spoon or spatula. This may cause more liquid to come out of the butter. Drain the liquid before storing.

, The butter will be immediately ready to use, but as with any dairy product, it needs to be refrigerated when not in use.

Bring your school supplies.,
Have unique style.,
Intelligence.,
Be motivated.",How to Prepare for College/University," Make sure you are well acquainted with the syllabus before coming to your first class session. The syllabus contains everything your professor wants you to know for his or her class, so be prepared. You don’t want to be hit with a surprise assignment that you didn’t do because you never read the syllabus. Check online for the syllabus because most colleges will have class home pages on their websites. Most of the time, you will be able to check what books you need for your respective classes ahead of time. Once you know what books you need, you need to visit the campus bookstore to buy your books. Another viable option for school textbooks are sites like half.com and amazon.com. Buying your books through sites such as these are often money savers, just make sure you factor in the amount of time it will take for shipping. Some students also are fortunate enough to know people who have had a particular class before. If so, ask around to see if someone has a book you could borrow for the semester.;
, The picture you have of college may be intimidating. Chances are you know little about the environment you will be spending the next four years in. What is meant by “style” is how each student wants to portray themselves. What do you want your style to say to the faculty and your peers? For some, fraternities and sororities play an important role in defining their style. One of the main draws of groups such as these is the sense of identity they afford their members. You don’t have to have it all figured out before you come to college, so don’t sweat the little things. Keep your main goal in focus and be prepared to grow and change into the person you want to become.

, Being prepared goes far beyond having the right books and the right clothes for college. More importantly, you have to be mentally prepared. Don’t fall into the same trap as many other college students. Be responsible. More than likely, you or your parents are paying quite a bit of money for you to attend college. Don’t throw that money away. Go to class. Wake up in the morning with enough time to get ready and eat some breakfast. The easiest way to ensure you wake up in the morning is going to bed at a decent hour the night before. It’s probably best to save the partying for the weekends. No one wants to sit in class next to someone who just rolled out of bed with yesterday’s clothes still on, and you don’t want to be the one who is constantly nagging people for their class notes because you were never there to fill them in. Also, ask your professor for help in the subjects you don’t understand. With few exceptions, professors are there to help you learn, so if something isn’t making sense to you, take advantage of your educational opportunity and ask the professor to explain it further. College is fun – and you can enjoy it! – but be responsible by keeping your mind sharp.

, It’s important to remember that college isn’t forever. You have a limited amount of time at your school to gain whatever you want from it. You alone have the power to make the most out of your education. It is easy to lose sight of your purpose when you’re in college, but never forget that you are going to college to get an education. If you can motivate yourself to excel in college, you will have a better chance at a career in your future. Don’t exaggerate your ability to change your habits. What I mean is, if you slack off in college, it will be hard for you to be diligent after college. Not only will you have extra ground to make up after graduation to get yourself in career-shape, but old habits die hard. Instill motivation in yourself early on and not only will you have a successful college experience, but also a successful career ahead of you. A career may not seem important early on in college, but graduation day will come quicker than you think, and with it, loans that have to be paid off as well as an independent life to be lived. Once you graduate you will, hopefully, be living on your own. Living on your own doesn’t just mean independence; it also means you must start paying for everything on your own. You won’t regret the time you put into your college career when that extra effort lands you a better job to help you pay off school debts and live an independent adult life.

Ensure you can send the item.,
Be informed about homemade canned or jarred foods.,
Tell the recipient first.,
Consider how to send the parcel.",How to Ship Perishable Food1," Check with your carrier first about fragile, potentially hazardous, and international shipments. The destination country you’re shipping to may have restrictions you should know about so that your package is accepted. Check the Individual Country Listings of the International Mail Manual for rules regarding the country you’re sending to.Things that can decompose easily or can’t be reasonably expected to arrive at their destination without spoiling can’t be mailed internationally. For example, fresh vegetables, fruit, meat and other items.Dry ice cannot be sent via international mail.You may be able to use a carrier who offers temperature controlled freight services, depending on what your sending. Consult with carriers about your individual situation.;
, If you are sending homemade canned or jarred foods, you should check with the National Center for Home Food Preservation for information on which foods are considered unsafe for canning and are not recommended as gifts. Home-processed cheese and meat shouldn’t be mailed, as the moisture and acidity are unknown and can cause harmful bacteria.Examples of foods that are considered unsafe for canned gifts include herbs or vegetables in oil, breads or cakes, homemade chocolate or fudge sauce, and pumpkin butter.Use only jars and lids that are recommended for canning, and only recipes tested for processing by reliable sources.

, If possible, notify the recipient first and schedule a delivery date that works for both of you. If the item is food that should arrive cold, tell them to ensure that it is still refrigerator cold when they open the package. Notify the recipient that they should refrigerate or freeze the food immediately. Your carrier is responsible to deliver the perishable items on time, but the customer is responsible for someone being available to receive the package.If the item is food that should arrive cold, tell the recipient not to eat or even taste it if the following condition isn’t met: the food should be delivered partially or fully frozen, or at least refrigerator cold. If unsure, the recipient can use a food thermometer to check: it should not be above 40°F (4.4°C)., The FDA recommends that you ship perishable items using overnight delivery.Avoid sending at the end of the week. Your perishable items will probably sit in a shipping facility over the weekend. Send items as early in the week as possible.Consider where the recipient is and whether they can receive food and refrigerate it on acceptance. Will their residence or place of work be better for this?


If you’re sending items to an office, make sure that it will arrive on a weekday. Also ensure that the office has refrigerator space for keeping the items cold.

Try to avoid items that require refrigeration.,
Pack cold food.,
Add gel ice packs.,
Add dry ice.,
Add liner.",How to Ship Perishable Food2," If you’re shipping perishable items, try if possible to opt for items that don’t need to be kept cold. It is a lot less hassle and will require less packaging and handling considerations.


For example, seasoning packets, hardy candy, dried fruits, and canned nuts don't require refrigeration. Homemade sweets like praline, toffee and sugar cookies don't need refrigerated packaging because their sugar content wards off bacteria., Don’t pack food while it’s still hot, or it will form condensation which encourages mold growth and may cause the food to become soggy. Cool the food first until it is refrigerator cold or frozen solid.Then pack it in sealed plastic bags.If the food needs to stay cool or cold, include a source of cold, such as dry ice or frozen gel packs. You may want to consult with a packaging expert for your delivery service and ask which method is best for your shipment as well as where to purchase those items.Clearly mark the package “Perishable – Keep Refrigerated” on the outside. The marking should be on the address side of the mailpiece., Choose gel ice packs for products that should be cooled at 32° F (0° C) and 60° F (16° C). Freeze them according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Put perishable food in sealed plastic bags. Separate the gel packs from the perishable items using cardboard. Alternatively, you can look for a carrier with a cold shipping program.For example, FedEx offers cold shipping for healthcare products like medications and breast milk.
You can use other kinds of ice packs, but disposable ice packs are the most economic choice. Test the number and size of ice packs your product needs inside the specific container you select., Use dry ice for frozen items.Be sure it's legal to send the frozen packaging materials in your area. Dry ice maintains its coldness longer than gel packs, but requires extra safety measures. Wear gloves and goggles when handling it so that you don’t burn yourself. Don’t let dry ice come in contact with food. Put food in a sealed plastic bag to protect it from dry ice. Separate dry ice from your perishable items using cardboard.


Don’t wrap dry ice. Warn the recipient if the packaging contains dry ice. Check with your shipping carrier first and find out the allowable amount of dry ice.
If you use dry ice, you need to label the address side of the box that it contains dry ice. You will also need to comply with the rules of your carrier (UPS, FedEx, or USPS).

, Pack the perishable item, cardboard, and coolant in a two-millimeter liner bag. Secure the bag closed with a rubber band. Now the items are ready to be placed in an insulated container.You can purchasing shipping liner bags online or at local office supply stores.

Find a suitable container.,
Include instructions.,
Pack baked goods.,
Provide the right internal packaging.,
Seal up the box.,
Label the box.",How to Ship Perishable Food3," The items should be placed inside a sturdy, strong box or an insulated cooler.Corrugated cardboard works well.Other containers you may consider are Styrofoam boxes inside of cardboard boxes, insulated liners with bubble wrap, or insulated pads.The box should have a Mullen Test of 200 pounds or more to use it for shipping perishable items. A Mullen Test measures how much weight boxes can handle without bursting.For items that need to remain cold, use insulated foam containers with walls a minimum of one and a half inches thick. Then place the foam container inside a sturdy container., Consider including instructions for the recipient inside the package. Provide information about storage and preparation. This is optional but helpful, especially if you’re sending perishable food to customers who may be unsure how to prepare or handle it. Label any food inside the box as well as externally.


For food items, make it clear what ingredients are included for the sake of those with allergies or dietary restrictions.
If the item should arrive cold, include instructions about ensuring refrigerator coldness (not over 40°F/4.4°C) when they open the package. Notify the recipient that they should refrigerate or freeze the food immediately, and specify that they should not eat or even taste it if it doesn’t arrive cold., Maintain the freshness of baked goods during transit by wrapping them. Use foil or plastic to wrap. Cookies and bars need individual wrapping. Pack in layers using wax paper to separate the layers. Place items stacked or in a tin.Hard cookies ship better than soft cookies, which can break and crumble during mailing., Provide at least two inches of cushion around glass and other fragile items. Make sure that bottles and jars are sealed well. Don’t choose newspaper as your packing material, as it doesn’t have cushioning. Add any buffering packing materials needed. Use items such as plastic containers and Styrofoam peanuts. Wrap items well in plastic wrap or foil and pack them snugly.For chilled or frozen foods, opt for plastic foam peanuts, bubble wrap, bagged foam or Instapak®.

, Use plenty of tape to keep the box from opening up during transportation. Avoid duct tape and masking tape; they can detach in cold weather and melt under hot conditions. Choose a tape meant for shipping., Address the box with a complete mailing address and phone number. Clearly mark the package “Perishable” on the outside.The marking would be on the address side of the mailpiece. Also include your name and return address.If required, contents should be identified on the address side of the mail.
You can use a mailer endorsement if you want to request return, forwarding, or address correction for items that are undeliverable to the address specified.
Add the instructions “Fragile, handle with care” on the address side of the mailing piece. If the contents are food, add “Food contents.”

Place your storage containers in a large stockpot.,
Cover the containers with water.,
Boil the water.,
Remove and let dry.",How to Pasteurize1," Carefully arrange your storage containers and covers in a large stockpot. They should be able to stand upright without knocking into each other.


Note that the size of your stockpot will vary depending on the size of your storage containers, and the size of your storage containers will vary depending on how much liquid you have.
Glass containers work best. Canning jars with metal lids are recommended for beginners, but thick glass bottles with cork stoppers can also be used.
To prevent the containers from knocking into each other during the sterilization process, you may wish to place a clean dish towel at the bottom of the stockpot. Do so now instead of waiting until after the water boils.

, Fill the stockpot with enough water to completely cover the storage containers and covers.


It is best to arrange the containers inside of the stockpot before bringing the water to a boil. Glass tends to crack or otherwise break when exposed to rapid changes in temperature, so submerging the jars after the water has already reached a boil is not recommended.

, Set the stockpot on the stove over high heat. Continue heating the water until it reaches a steady boil, then allow the containers and covers to stay submerged for 10 minutes.


Start the time only after the water has reached a steady boil. Do not start the time as soon as you place the stockpot on the stove.

, Turn the heat off and carefully lift the containers and covers out of the hot water. Set them aside on clean, dry dish towels and allow them to air dry.


Use caution when removing the glass containers since they can still break easily at this stage. Lift the containers out using jar tongs or a similar utensil; do not attempt to use your bare hands.
Even though air drying is recommended, you can speed up the process by drying the containers and covers with clean, dry dish towels. Wait until after the jars and covers have had a chance to cool down slightly, though, to prevent the hot glass from burning your skin. Also the cork will need to air dry; you will not be able to sufficiently dry a cork stopper using a towel.
Do not place the containers in a refrigerator or freezer to speed the cooling process. Doing so will cause the glass to break.
It is strongly recommended that you do not allow the containers to cool completely to room temperature. Containers that are slightly warm are less likely to break during pasteurization.

Never submerge cutting boards in a sink of water! Wood is porous and will soak up water, causing the cutting board to crack when it dries.;
, Wipe them with full-strength white vinegar after each use. The acetic acid in the vinegar is a good disinfectant, and it's effective against such harmful bugs as E. coli, Salmonella, and Staphylococcus. Vinegar is especially good for people with chemical allergies. Keep a spray bottle of undiluted vinegar handy for easy cleaning and sanitizing.

, 3% hydrogen peroxide can also be used as a bacteria-killer. To kill the germs on your cutting board, use a plain white paper towel to wipe the board down with vinegar, then use another paper towel to wipe it with hydrogen peroxide.

, Saturate the surface with a sanitizing solution and allow it to stand for several minutes, then rinse and air dry or pat dry with plain white paper towels."

Go to reputable establishments.,
Shop at good fishmongers.,
Find out if the fish has been properly frozen.,
Be inquisitive.,
Observe fish handling practices.,
Use your senses to determine the quality of the fish.",How to Safely Eat Sushi1," The best way to safely eat sushi is to go to a reputable establishment that serves high quality, sushi-grade fish. Ask friends and family members for restaurant recommendations. Go to establishments that use fresh ingredients, properly freeze and store fish and follow food safety guidelines., If you intend to make your own sushi, it is important purchase fish from a reputable fishmonger that sells high quality, sushi-grade products. Look to see whether the fish is properly packed with ice. Pick fish that is firm and shiny. Make sure your fishmonger properly freezes and stores the fish.If the fish smells too “fishy” or has a bad odor, you should avoid it.
Make sure your fishmonger knows that you want to eat the fish raw., Raw fish needs to be frozen at specific temperatures in order to kill parasites prior to consumption. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has specific guidelines for freezing fish prior to raw consumption. Ask to see the logs of the restaurant or fishmonger to determine whether the fish has been frozen at the required temperatures.Review the logs to see if the freezing temperatures and times meet FDA guidelines:If the fish has been frozen and stored at -20 Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit) for seven days, it meets FDA guidelines.
If the fish has been frozen at -35 Celsius (-31 Fahrenheit) until solid for at least 15 hours, it meets FDA guidelines.
If the fish has been frozen at -35 Celsius (-31 Fahrenheit) until solid and then stored at -20 Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit) for at least 24 hours, it meets FDA guidelines.

, Ask the staff at the fishmonger or the restaurant to tell you about the fish handling procedures. For instance, you could try asking the following kinds of questions:“Is your equipment sanitized to ensure there is no cross-contamination from non-sushi-grade fish?”
“Where does your fish come from?”
“How long has the fish been frozen?”
“How do you handle the fish?”

, If you are purchasing sushi from a restaurant that allows you to observe the chef, you can watch their cooking practices. See if they are using clean cutting boards and knives. Determine whether they are disinfecting equipment and changing their gloves prior to cutting sushi-grade fish., There is no official determination of “sushi-grade” or “sashimi-grade” fish, so you need to use your senses to identify the quality. Smell and touch the fish or sushi prior to purchasing and eating it.If you are buying raw fish for sushi, it should smell like the ocean.
It should not smell too “fishy.”
The fish should not be flaky.
The fish should not be too soft.

Set up a double boiler.,
Pour the liquid into the smaller dish.,
Heat the double boiler on the stove.,
Retain the proper temperature.,
Pour the hot liquid into sterilized containers.,
Cool rapidly.,
Store in cool conditions.",How to Pasteurize2," Fill the bottom pan of a double boiler with approximately 2 inches (5 cm) of water. Place the smaller, top pan into the first.


If you do not have a double boiler, you can use the combination of a large stockpot and a small saucepan, metal bowl, or thick glass bowl. The smaller dish must be small enough to fit into the larger stockpot.
To prevent the bottom of the smaller dish from touching the bottom of the larger stockpot, place a metal cookie cutter inside the stockpot and rest the smaller dish on top of it.Note that the water level inside of the larger stockpot should not be high enough to reach the bottom of the smaller dish.;
, Pour the liquid to be pasteurized into the smaller dish of the double boiler.


Since this liquid will not actually reach a boil, you can fill the dish fairly high. Leave at least 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of empty headspace at the top of the dish to further reduce the risk of overflow, however.

, Place the entire double boiler on the stove and heat it over medium to medium-high.


The water in the bottom portion of the double boiler should begin to boil, but the liquid in the top portion should not be allowed to reach a boil.
Stir the liquid frequently as the double boiler heats to further reduce the risk of burning or curdling.

, Allow the liquid being pasteurized to reach a temperature of 162 degrees Fahrenheit (72 degrees Celsius). Hold that temperature for no fewer than 16 seconds before removing the top portion of the double boiler from the heat.Alternatively, heat the liquid to a temperature of 150 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius) and hold it for no fewer than 30 minutes before removing it from the heat.
Check the temperature of the liquid by keeping a cooking thermometer submerged inside. The tip of the thermometer should only be about two-thirds deep into the liquid. Do not allow it to rest on the bottom or sides of the dish.
If any skin forms while the liquid heats, remove it with a ladle or spoon.

, Carefully pour the liquid into previously sterilized containers as soon as you remove the liquid from the heat.


Leave 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of empty headspace at the top of each jar when pouring the liquid. After filling the jars, cover them with an appropriate lid.
You may wish to use a funnel or ladle to minimize accidental spills.
For best results, use containers that are both sterilized and preheated. Glass can break when exposed to dramatic changes in temperature., Place the filled containers in cold water and allow them to sit for 15 minutes.


Use a sink or large basin for this step.
The water does not need to be ice cold, but it should be notably cooler than room temperature. Extremely cold temperatures may cause the glass to break, however, so you should not place the containers in the refrigerator or freezer immediately after filling them.

, After rapidly cooling the jars in cold water, transfer them to a refrigerator.


The liquid should cool to a temperature below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) within the first six hours.
Even after the initial cooling process, you should continue to store the liquid in the refrigerator. Pasteurized milk can last for up to two weeks, while juice and cider may last twice that amount of time.

Pick sushi made with cured fish.,
Order sushi without any raw fish.,
Choose sushi with low-mercury fish.,
Pick saltwater over freshwater fish.,
Avoid sushi if you are part of a high-risk population.",How to Safely Eat Sushi2," Ask your server if there are menu options for smoked, pickled or salted fish. For instance, many sushi restaurants will have a smoked salmon and avocado roll. Fish that has been cured by smoking, pickling or salting is safer to eat.The process of smoking salmon will eliminate any worms that may have been in the fish.

, There is always some level of risk with eating raw fish sushi.To avoid this risk altogether, you could choose sushi varieties that do not contain raw fish. For instance, try ordering one of the following varieties of sushi that do not contain raw fish:

California roll with crab stick imitations.
Tomago sushi with egg.
PLS roll.
Unagi.
Smoked salmon sushi.
Epic bacon roll.

, If you like to eat fish more than twice per week, it is important to choose sushi made from low-mercury fish. Albacore tuna, swordfish, shark and marlin are among the fish with very high concentrations of mercury.Tilefish, mackerel and mahi-mahi also have high mercury levels.Instead of high-mercury fish, order raw-fish sushi with lower levels of mercury.

For instance, salmon, eel, crab and clam have low levels of mercury.If you are pregnant or nursing, it is especially important to avoid sushi with high levels of mercury.

, In order to avoid fish that has been infected with parasites, you should always pick saltwater over freshwater fish. There is a higher risk that freshwater fish has been infected with parasites. Instead of freshwater fish like trout or sturgeon, pick saltwater fish like albacore, cod, eel or tuna.Farmed fish is raised in a controlled environment and may be safer to eat., Certain groups of people are more vulnerable to foodborne illnesses. Pregnant women, infants, young children and older adults may be more vulnerable to foodborne illnesses. If you belong to one of these groups, you should generally avoid raw-fish sushi.If you are unsure of your level of risk, you should consult your physician.

Combine water and a tablespoon of vinegar in a small bowl.,
Place half a sheet of nori on the bamboo rolling mat.,
Cut and serve the sushi roll.",How to Safely Eat Sushi3," In order to avoid bacterial infection, you will need to properly sanitize your working area. It is necessary to have clean knives, cutting boards, bowls and kitchen counters. In addition, you should properly sanitize your hands prior to preparing sushi., Sushi-grade fish should be sourced from the most reputable fishmonger in your city. Pick fillets rather than steaks, since they are easier to slice.To ensure it is good quality fish, you should examine the color, smell and texture of the fish.

If you live in a country without a strong sushi culture, you might consider making sushi without raw fish.Look for fish that is brightly colored.
Avoid fish that has a strong, bad odor.
Avoid slimy fish.

, You will need a freezer that is cold enough to properly store the sushi-grade fish. Check your freezer temperature to see if it meets the requirements. Place an appliance thermometer in your freezer and read the temperature.If your freezer gets down to -20 Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit), you can use it to store your sushi-grade fish., If you are a beginner, you are more likely to have a good experience making sushi rolls. Nigiri sushi is very difficult to make at home. It requires years of practice and professional training. However, sushi rolls can be prepared with the right ingredients and tools, such as a rice cooker, appropriate knives, a rice rolling mat, large and small bowls and a rice paddle. To make sushi rolls, you will need a few key ingredients:Sticky rice or medium-grain, Japanese-style white rice.
Sushi vinegar.
Nori.
Wasabi.
Soy sauce.
Ingredients for your sushi, such as tuna, shitake and asparagus tips.

, Rinse and drain the sticky rice. Put a two-inch piece of kombu seaweed in with your rice in the pot or rice cooker. Cook the rice. Take out the seaweed. Transfer the rice to a large bowl. Add a tablespoon of sushi vinegar to the rice and mix it around with your rice paddle., Cut your fish fillet, such as tuna, into thin strips. They should be eight inches long., Dip your hands into the bowl. Then, clap your hands together to remove excess water., Make sure the shiny side of the nori is facing down. Spread a quarter inch layer of rice over the nori. Add a strip of tuna to the rice. Lift up the bamboo mat and roll it away from you. When you get to the end, press down on the bamboo mat to compress the sushi roll., Start by cutting it in half. Then, cut each half into thirds with your chef’s knife. Place the sushi on a serving tray with soy sauce, wasabi and pickled ginger. Serve the sushi roll right away in order to ensure safe consumption."

Pour the liquid into sterilized containers.,
Place the containers in a large stockpot of water.,
Heat the water and retain the proper temperature.,
Remove and cool quickly.,
Store in cool temperatures.",How to Pasteurize3," Pour the liquid you wish to pasteurize into previously sterilized glass containers. Seal the containers with appropriate lids.


Leave 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of empty headspace at the top of each container. The liquid can expand during the pasteurization process, and if the containers are too full when this happens, they could break.
Note that a tightly sealed cover is essential for this method. If using bottles with corks, place the corks in the filled bottles and use kitchen twine (or string) to tie them down. Metal lids should not need to be tied down.

, Lay the glass containers down in the bottom of a large stockpot. Fill the stockpot with enough water to completely cover the jars.


Glass containers lying down in a horizontal position are less likely to knock into each other and break during pasteurization.
If you choose to keep the bottles upright, it might be a good idea to place a clean dish towel or jar rack at the bottom of the stockpot to help prevent the glasses from moving around and crashing into each other.

, Place the filled stockpot on your stove over medium heat. Gradually heat the water until it reaches a temperature of 175 degrees Fahrenheit (80 degrees Celsius), then hold that temperature for 20 minutes before removing the glass jars.Heat the water slowly. Rapid heating can break the glass and may disrupt the pasteurization process.
Use a cooking thermometer to monitor the temperature of the water. Submerge the tip of the thermometer two-thirds deep into the water. Do not allow it to come into contact with the sides or bottom of the pan.

, Once the bottles have been properly heated, remove them from the hot water and submerge them in cool water for 15 minutes.


Fill a clean sink or basin to do this. Use water that is just slightly cooler than room temperature since ice-cold water can cause the glass to break.
Do not place the hot bottles directly in the freezer or refrigerator.
Use jar tongs or a similar utensil to remove the glass containers from the hot water. Do not use your bare hands.

, After cooling the filled glasses in cool water, move them to a refrigerator. Store until ready to consume.


Note that the pasteurized liquid should cool to a temperature below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) within six hours to be considered safe.
When stored in the refrigerator, pasteurized milk can last for up to two weeks. Juices and ciders can last up to a month in the refrigerator.

Avoid packing your refrigerator tightly.,
Use an appliance thermometer to monitor the real temperature inside your refrigerator and your freezer.,
Put groceries and “doggie bags” away as soon as you get home.

,
Use a cooler to keep groceries cold.,
Refrigerate your home-cooked foods within two hours of cooking or heating.

,
Clean up spills inside the fridge right away.,
Store all food and beverages in closed containers.

,
Divide or quick-chill large batches of hot food before refrigerating.,
Read the label and follow directions.",How to Refrigerate Foods Safely," Packing loosely allows the cold air to circulate.;
,


The refrigerator should be at 40° F (4° C) or below, but above 32° F (0° C).
Your freezer should stay at 0° F (-18° C).

,, Do this if you have a long drive or plan to do more shopping after you hit the grocery store. The temperature inside your vehicle is usually much warmer than the outside temperature, even in cool weather.

,, This prevents bacteria growth and cross-contamination from leaking meat packages.

,, This ensures that it cools down out of the danger zone quickly enough.


Soups and stews can be placed into smaller containers that will cool quickly in the refrigerator.
Meats can be cut into smaller portions and packaged separately, to cool evenly and quickly in the fridge.
If you do not want to divide the food, you can use an ice bath to quickly cool it down to 40° F (4° C) before refrigerating.

, Packaged foods and meat will often have a “use-by” date or instructions, such as “Refrigerate and use within three days after opening.”

Use child-proof locks.",How to Keep Your Kitchen Clean and Safe," Meal preparation and eating can make a mess in the kitchen. One of the best ways to keep your kitchen clean is to clean food and dishes after each meal. That way, messes don’t pile up, and you have a clean kitchen to work with at the start of your next meal. After each meal:Clear the table
Transfer leftovers to airtight containers and store them in the refrigerator or freezer
Wash, dry, and put away all the dishes
Run the dishwasher when it’s full
Clean spills, crumbs, and messes from the stove, floors, table, and counters
Wash out the sink;
, Another easy way to keep your kitchen clean and prevent stains, mold, and other problems is to address spills as soon as they happen. For food spills, use a spoon or cloth to clean up solid waste. Clean up excess liquids or sauces with a cloth. Spray the area with an all-purpose cleaner and wipe it dry.


When spills involve raw meat, use a disinfecting spray to clean the mess to prevent the spread of bacteria.
Cleaning liquid spills from the floor is also important for safety, because a wet floor is a slipping hazard., A full dishwasher can mean that dishes start piling up in the sink, and this makes for a messy kitchen. To avoid this, empty the dishwasher when the dishes are clean, and return all the dishes to their proper places. That way, you can put dirty dishes from the sink into the dishwasher and keep the kitchen neat and tidy., Having empty counters is a great way to keep a kitchen looking neat and organized, and it also gives you more space for food preparation and other work.Here are some ideas for clearing cluttered counters:


Store small appliances like toasters and coffeemakers in cupboards
Keep non-refrigerated produce in a fruit bowl on the kitchen table
Designate a special drawer for random items that are often used in the kitchen, like pens, paper, and mail
Find a permanent home for all pots, pans, and kitchenware
Store all ingredients, including often-used flour and sugar, in the pantry

, The garbage disposal can harbor dangerous bacteria and offensive smells, but regular cleaning will prevent this. Clean the disposal at least once a week by:Filling an ice cube tray with vinegar
Pouring baking soda into the disposal
Turning on the water and running the disposal
Pouring the frozen vinegar cubes down the disposal
Letting the disposal run until all the baking soda and cubes are gone

, Shelf and drawer liners are great for keeping a clean kitchen because they can be cleaned and replaced easily. Shelf liners are especially important in pantries where you store food, but they also protect the shelves in all your cupboards and pantries.To clean the liners, empty the shelf and spray an all-purpose cleaner on the liner. Wipe it down with a clean cloth. Allow the liner to dry before returning items to the shelf.

, The refrigerator is where you keep most of your food, so it’s important for both safety and cleanliness to keep this appliance clean. Clean spills as they occur. Once a month, remove all the food from the refrigerator and freezer and wipe the drawers, shelves, and interior surfaces with an all-purpose cleaner. Wipe the surfaces dry and return the food.To absorb smells in the refrigerator, keep an open box of baking soda or a bowl of coffee beans in the refrigerator.

, Kitchen floors get messy very quickly with dust, crumbs, food particles, and other matter. To keep the floor clean, sweep or vacuum the floor in the kitchen every evening after the final meal, or each morning before breakfast.Sweeping regularly around the whole house will help minimize dust and allergens throughout the house as well.

, On top of daily sweeping, you should also mop the floor every week to keep the floor clean. Mopping will remove dirt, spills, sticky spots, and other messes from the floor. Fill a bucket with soapy water and use a sponge or mop to wash the entire kitchen floor.


Allow the floor to dry fully before walking on it again to prevent slips and footmarks on the floor.

, Every family has different needs in terms of garbage and recycling containers. Replace your containers with larger ones if you find your garbage is often overflowing, that items often fall out and present tripping hazards, or if you have to empty the containers daily., To keep your kitchen clean, bug-free, and odor-free, tie up full garbage and recycling bags and take them out to the garage or another secondary storage area until it’s time for pickup.When you take out the garbage, wipe down the inside and outside of the can or bin with an all-purpose cleaner. Let the can dry before adding a fresh bag.

, Because your garbage can stores trash and food waste, it can harbor mold, mildew, smells, and bacteria. It’s important to clean and disinfect your garbage can once a month to keep your kitchen clean and sanitary. To clean the can thoroughly:Rinse the can outside with a hose or in the bathtub
Spray the inside and outside with an enzymatic or disinfecting spray
Put on gloves and scrub the inside and outside of the can
Rinse the can with clean water
Pat the can dry or let it air dry outside

, These are temperature-sensitive foods that are prone to bacteria and spoilage. Always keep meat, fish, and dairy in the refrigerator if you're going to use them within a few days, or in the freezer for longer storage.Transfer meat and fish to air-tight containers or freezer bags before storing to keep them fresh for longer. This will also prevent the spread of bacteria to other foods.

, To wash your hands properly, rinse them under running water. Add soap, and lather for 30 seconds. Make sure to get under your nails and between your fingers. Rinse your hands under running water, and pat them dry with a clean towel.


Washing your hands before preparing food will prevent the spread of bacteria and dirt to your food.
Washing your hands after cooking will prevent the spread of bacteria from the food to other items in your house. This is especially important after working with meat and poultry., When you're finished preparing a meal, clean the areas where you were working to kill bacteria that may have been present on the raw food. Clean all cutting tools and boards in hot soapy water. Spray down counters, sinks, and other surfaces with a disinfecting kitchen spray. Wipe the areas with a clean cloth., Leftover food is great for lunch tomorrow, but to keep yourself and your family safe, it must be refrigerated immediately to prevent bacterial growth. As soon as the food stops steaming, transfer it to an airtight container and put it in the refrigerator or freezer., Because bacteria can grow on foods that are the right temperature, it’s important to reheat leftovers to at least 165 F (74 C) before eating them. This will kill any bacteria that could cause food poisoning.The easiest and most effective way to determine the temperature of food is with a food thermometer.

, To prevent bacteria from growing on foods that have been frozen, you must defrost foods properly as well. Thawing foods on the counter at room temperature is not advisable, as bacteria will quickly grow. Safe ways to defrost foods include:In the refrigerator over the course of 24 hours
In the microwave using the defrost setting
In a bath of cold water, where the water is changed every 30 minutes

, To prevent cross-contamination of foods, use separate cutting boards and knives for meat and vegetables. This is important because foods like vegetables don’t always get cooked as thoroughly as meat. If bacteria from the meat gets transferred to the vegetables, it can cause serious illness.


To make your job easier, try using different colors for your meat utensils and vegetable ones., Hot oil tends to splatter a lot, and this can cause burns if the oil lands on your skin. Place a splatter guard over frying pans and pots when you're cooking greasy foods like bacon, or when you're frying or deep frying foods.Splattering oil is a kitchen cleanliness nightmare, and splatter guards will also help to keep your kitchen clean.

, Bacteria can grow quickly on kitchen towels, cloths, and sponges. To avoid spreading these around, wash cloths and towels in the washing machine after a day of use. Have multiple sets of towels and cloths so that you always have fresh ones while dirty ones are being laundered.Non-washable sponges can be disinfected in a bleach and water solution. Combine ¾ (176 ml) of bleach and 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Soak the sponge in the solution for five minutes., Knives, scissors, vegetable peelers, and other sharp kitchen items should be kept off the counters at all times to prevent accidents. Outfit knifes with guards, and store sharp items in a special drawer.To keep your knives sharp and safe, store them in a knife block instead of a drawer.

, This is especially important in households with young children, but it’s also important to prevent accidents. Any time you're cooking on the stove, try to position pots on the back burners. Always turn pot handles so they're facing away from the edge of the stove.


Turning pot handles toward the stove prevents kids from pulling hot pots of food down on themselves, and keeps handles out of the way so you don’t knock the pots when you're cooking., Kitchen fires are one of the most common causes of house fires. Having a fire extinguisher in the kitchen will allow you to react quickly and put out a small fire if an accident does occur, and this will prevent the fire from spreading.


Store the fire extinguisher near the stove, under a counter, or by an exit in the kitchen.
Make sure every member of the family knows how to use the fire extinguisher properly.

, Kitchen fires often happen when people get distracted. When you're cooking, don’t leave the kitchen for any reason, including to answer the phone, to address other chores, or to run errands.If you must leave the kitchen or the house in the middle of cooking, turn off all appliances, turn off the oven, turn off the stove, and remove food from the heat before leaving.

, Child-proofing your kitchen is important if you have kids or often have children over at your house. These can be installed on drawers, cupboards, and appliances to keep small children (and pets) from getting into things they shouldn’t.Child-proof locks are especially important for drawers that contain sharp items, cabinets where you store chemicals, and other places where dangerous items are kept.

Use a tested recipe, and follow instructions carefully.,
Check the temperature of your oven.,
Preheat the oven unless the cooking instructions say otherwise.,
Learn the correct temperatures for different meats, then use a thermometer to check it.,
Place the probe of your thermometer into the thickest part of the meat (the center), but not touching a bone.,
Be aware of the quality of the food you are cooking.,
Look at the food when it is finished cooking.,
Cook vegetables until they are tender to your personal taste.,
Use the clean knife test on cakes and baked batter breads.,
Learn to adjust recipes for cooking at high elevations.,
Test your pasta.",How to Know if Food is Undercooked," You do not want to serve undercooked food, but often overcooking it means the dogs will be eating it anyway.;
, Oven temperatures vary significantly from the dial setting. An oven control dial may say ""350"", yet the oven will be cooler (or hotter) than this by a significant amount.

, The few minutes it takes an oven to reach cooking temperature are not minutes the food is actually cooking at THAT temperature.

,


Chicken: 165 F.
Beef:155 F.
Pork:160 F.
Ground beef:165 F.
Fish: 145 F

, The thickest part of the cut will be the slowest to reach the desired temperature., Bacteria are the primary concern in causing food poisoning, and practically any food can be contaminated if it is not handled properly. Food which may have been left in the freezer too long, or left out unrefrigerated when it should have been should be discarded.

, The fluids draining from poultry should be clear when you cut it, and the meat tissue attached to the bone should have no pinkness evident. Beef, when handled properly, may be pink, or even red, but ground beef, because of handling and processing, is more likely to be exposed to bacteria and should never be eaten pink. Pork will have an even, light appearance with no pink showing at all. Cured ham labeled fully cooked requires no further cooking.

, Potatoes, carrots, and other large ""chunky"" vegetables are usually done when a fork can be inserted easily, but before they become mushy.

, Insert a knife in the center, and if it comes out clean, the baked item is fully cooked.

, Since the higher you are above sea level, the lower the boiling point of water, cooking at very high elevations require more cooking time.

, When cooking pasta on a stove top, you can remove some and taste test it to make sure it is cooked through.

Make sure you know if a guest has a food allergy.,
Be very careful with severe allergies.,
Use labels.,
Ask other guests not to bring food from home with allergens in them.,
For a particularly extreme allergy, make sure everybody knows what allergy there is, even if it doesn't apply to them.",How to Host a Person with a Food Allergy," Call your guests, or talk to them personally about any allergies at all (so you can be prepared), or, if you are having your guest R.S.V.P., tell them in the invitation to include any allergies they might have when they R.S.V.P.
, If someone has a serious allergy to any food at all, make sure that that food doesn't touch any of the prepared refreshments at all. Allergies can be very serious, so be sure to remember when someone has a severe allergy., If you already have a snack prepared with an allergen, separate that from all the other foods, and put a label on it saying ""This has peanuts/gluten/soy/etc."" This way, people know the allergens in it, and will stay away if they have an allergy., Depending on what allergy you are catering for, make sure to tell them not to put soy/peanuts/gluten/shellfish/etc. in them. And if any guest comes in with a food containing an allergen, separate it at the door and make sure the guest with the allergy knows to avoid it., Some people can have allergic reactions even to just traces of the given food. If this is the case, inform everyone in the area or at the event, so that they can wash their hands and keep any traces of the relevant food(s) separate from the main dining area. The more people know to be careful, the less chance there is of an allergic reaction, no matter how small."

Avoid possibly contaminated jars and cans of food.,
Don't buy hot dogs if the liquid in the package is cloudy.

,
Know what to look for in frozen foods.,
Choose your chicken wisely.,
Choose your turkey wisely.",How to Keep Food Safe1," Don't buy cans that are leaking, bulging, or dented. Jars of food should not be cracked or have loose lids. Avoid buying jars where the button on the lid has already been popped up.;
,, Frozen foods should be frozen completely solid. They should be free of ice crystals and frost, as these are signs that the food may have thawed and then been refrozen.

, Chicken is easily contaminated if not stored properly. Be extra careful when picking out chicken to bring home.


Choose your chicken towards the end of your shopping trip. The longer it sits in your shopping cart, the more likely it will be to go bad.
Choose wrapped packages without tears, holes, or leaks. The package should be cold and feel firm when lightly squeezed.
Smell the chicken. If it smells spoiled, don't buy it.
Check the sell-by date. Remember that this is different than the use-by date; it's okay if it's today's date. Just plan to use the chicken within two days of its sell-by date to be safe.

, Like chicken, turkey is easily contaminated. Be sure to choose the turkey near the end of your shopping trip to avoid contamination while it's in your cart.


Find a wrapped turkey without holes, tears, or leaks. Be sure that the turkey is cold and feels firm when lightly squeezed.
Choose a turkey from the bottom of the stack. Often, those that have been stacked near the top do not stay cold enough to guarantee safe eating.

Check the temperature.,
Don't let hot food sit at room temperature for more than 2 hours.,
Refrigerate hot leftovers until ready to reserve.,
Thaw frozen food in the microwave or refrigerator.,
Store foods in the appropriate sections of the refrigerator.",How to Keep Food Safe2," Remember that hot foods should always be kept above 140˚F, refrigerated foods should be kept between 35˚F and 40˚F and freezer foods should be kept below 10˚F.

, This includes prep time. If it has been that long, either reheat or refrigerate the food to lessen the possibility of contamination.



Never partially cook poultry, meat, fish, or seafood and then set aside to finish later (even if you refrigerate it). This can actually aid in bacterial growth, increasing your chances of food poisoning.







, This also includes takeout and leftover restaurant dishes. Break up large amounts of leftovers into many smaller containers to that they chill more quickly.


When you refrigerate lots of warm leftovers, make sure to adjust the refrigerator to a slightly colder setting. Change back to the original setting after about 8 hours.
Be sure to reheat the food to at least 165˚F. Use a cover to retain moisture and help heat the center of the food. All gravies should be brought to a rolling boil.

, Never thaw it at room temperature. Cook immediately after thawing.


If thawing in the refrigerator, allow 5 hours per 1 lb. of frozen food. If thawing in the microwave, follow the manufacturers directors.

, Different parts of the fridge are slightly different temperatures, so it's important to know what to store where.


Store eggs in the carton on a shelf inside the fridge. Avoid storing them in the fridge door, as this compartment doesn't get cold enough to safely preserve them.
Store chicken in the meat compartment. If you don't have one, find the coldest part of the fridge and store your chicken there. Alternatively, you can freeze the chicken.
Store a turkey in the coldest place it will fit. If possible, store it in a tray so that the juices don't leak onto the rest of your food.

Wash your hands.,
Prepare hot, soapy water.,
Clean contaminated sponges and dishcloths.",How to Keep Food Safe3," Though it may seem excessive, it's important to wash your hands before and after you handle food. This is especially important when you work with raw meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, or eggs.

, Clean all utensils and surfaces immediately after contact with raw meat, poultry, fish, or seafood.

, This is most effective if you use hot, soapy water in the washing machine. You should also consider soaking them in a mixture of 3/4 cup chlorine bleach to 1 gallon (3.8 L) water.

"
"
Be smart while shopping.,
Thaw raw poultry, meat, fish, and seafood in a large tray.,
Use separate cutting boards.,
Wash your cutting boards well.,
Insert stuffing last.,
Throw away leftover marinate that has come in contact with raw poultry/meat/fish/seafood.,
Keep track of your plates.",How to Keep Food Safe4," In your grocery cart, keep raw poultry, meat, fish, or seafood away from foods that do not need to be cooked before eating.

, The tray should be big enough to catch any juices that may run off as a result of the defrosting process. This will prevent the juices from running and ruining other foods in your fridge.


To be extra safe, place the tray on the bottom shelf of the fridge while defrosting.

, Use a separate cutting board for raw poultry/meat/fish/seafood than you do for other ingredients.


Glass or plastic cutting boards are best for cutting easily contaminated foods. Wooden ones are more porous, meaning that it's easier for the contaminated juices to get trapped in them.
Consider using disposable cutting sheets when cutting raw poultry/meat/fish/seafood to protect your cutting board from contamination.

, As soon as possible after use, wash your cutting board in hot, soapy water or run it through the dishwasher. To be extra careful, you should also cover the board with a mixture of 1 teaspoon chlorine bleach to 1 quart water. Let stand for 2 to 3 minutes before rinsing thoroughly.

, This should be always be done immediately before cooking. Minimizing the amount of time the stuffing spends in contact with the raw meat will prevent bacteria from contaminating the stuffing.

, If you wish to serve it as sauce, bring to a rolling boil. Keeping it at a boil, stir for at least a minute before serving.

, Never put cooked food on a plate that was used for raw poultry, meat, fish, or seafood unless the plate has been thoroughly washed first.

Look for brown ""mite dust"" on the surface of your food.Flour mites have off-white bodies and are so small they are nearly invisible to the naked eye.,
Rub the mite dust or some questionable flour between your fingers and check for a minty smell.,
Spread some flour on a flat surface and inspect it after 15 minutes.,
Stick a piece of scotch tape on packages or on the pantry shelves and inspect for mites.,
Notice if you are inexplicably itchy after handling flour or other grains.,
Put severely infested foods in plastic garbage bags and put them in the trash bins outside your house.,
Freeze any dried goods that may be infested to kill the flour mites.,
Remove and sanitize any bins, jars, or containers where contaminated foodstuffs were stored.,
Thoroughly clean the pantry or cabinet where the infested goods were stored.,
Keep food storage areas dry and cool.,
Store flour, grains, cereal, and other susceptible foods in clean, airtight containers.This will keep your food fresh and dry and keep mites out.,
Buy dry goods in small portions.,
Tape bay leaves in your containers or in the cupboard where you store food.,
Store pet food away from your other dry goods.",How to Get Rid of and Prevent Flour Mites," Because of this, it is very difficult to detect mites until you have a full-blown infestation. The mites have brownish legs, and the collection of living and dead mites and their waste will appear as a brown coating or tinge.It may look a bit like sand.;
, When flour mites are crushed they give off a distinct minty odor.The food may also develop a sickly sweet smell or taste, even before you detect the mites., Make the flour as smooth and level as you can before walking away. If the flour is infested with mites, the surface will be uneven due to the movement of the mites., The mites will stick to the tape and you may be able to see them with a magnifying glass.Also check the glue on box tops, the edges of sealed flour canisters. They might not be able to get inside, but they may be on the lip and get in once you open the container.

, Though flour mites don't bite, some people may have an allergic reaction to the allergens on the mites or their waste products.This is also known as ""grocer's itch.""

, The flour mites feed on the germ in flour as well as mold, and their presence could indicate the food has gone bad. They can also pass the mold spores to other foods if they travel to another container.Don't worry if you think you may have consumed some of the mites--they are harmless to most people.


In rare cases, people may have an allergic reaction to consuming flour contaminated by lice, called oral mite anaphylaxis, or pancake syndrome. A reaction usually occurs within minutes after eating the contaminated food and can cause hives, difficulty breathing, swelling of the throat, nausea, weakness, and/or collapse.Contact a doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms.

, If you have foodstuffs that show no sign of infestation or are not completely overrun with mites, storing them at temperatures below 0°F (-18°C) for four to seven days will kill any stray mites, eggs, or larva.Once the mites are dead, try sifting the dry goods or removing portions you know were infested and may contain dead mites., You want to remove every last speck of food from these containers, depriving any surviving mites of their food. Wash the containers and lids in very hot water and make sure they are completely dry before you refill them., Vacuum the shelves and walls, paying special attention to crevices. If you don't have a vacuum, try using a clean, dry brush to sweep out the area.Make sure you throw the vacuum bag in the trash bin outside immediately after cleaning.


Wipe down all the surfaces, but avoid using chemical pesticides anywhere near your food or food storage.
Try cleaning with a mixture of water and vinegar (1 part vinegar to 2 parts water) or natural insect repellents and safe pesticides like neem oil or orange oil (1 part oil to 10 parts water).Use a hairdryer to dry the storage area. Flour mites like damp, humid places., Flour mites cannot thrive in a low-humidity environment (under 65%), and you should never see an infestation if your storage area is well-ventilated. Pay attention to the placement of kettles, cookers, dryers, and stoves and make sure they are not causing moist air to collect in food storage areas.Try keeping a fan in your pantry to cool the air and dry out any moisture.

, If there are any mites that survived your cleaning process, depriving them of their food source will cause them to starve and prevent them from laying eggs in your grains.


Resealable plastic bags can work short-term, but mites can chew holes through them and get to your food. Try glass or thick plastic containers instead.
The lifecycle of flour mites is about one month, so if you can keep everything clean and sealed up tight, any remaining mites should die off.Try to avoid combining old and new foods in the containers. Wait until you've used up all the flour in the bin, give the bin a thorough cleaning and remove any old flour stuck to the bottom, and then refill with the new flour., Though it may be a little more expensive than buying in large, bulk quantities, but if you buy smaller portions, you are less likely to have susceptible foodstuffs sitting around for long periods of time. If they sit in a humid environment for too long, they may become damp and start to mold and start another infestation of mites.Make sure you inspect all packaging before bringing dry goods home. Make sure they are not damp or damaged and that they were not stored on a damp shelf., Flour mites, cockroaches, moths, rats, weevils, and many other pests are said to hate the smell of bay leaves and will avoid your dry goods if they are present. You can put the leaves right into the container (the taste won't leech into your food) or tape them to the lid of the container or inside the pantry or cupboard.


There are conflicting reports about whether to use dry or fresh bay leaves. People have reported success with both, so buy whatever is easiest for you and see how it works., The regulations for pet foods aren't as strict as ours, and they may be more likely to harbor pests. Store these in airtight containers away from your own foodstuffs."

Keep uncooked chicken and other poultry cold prior to cooking it.,
Prevent cross contamination.,
Freeze chicken or poultry if you don't plan on cooking it for a day or two.,
Defrost frozen chicken properly before cooking.,
Cook your chicken to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).,
Wash your cutting boards, hands, utensils and countertops with an anti-bacterial soap or detergent after preparing the raw poultry.",How to Handle Uncooked Poultry," If you plan on purchasing chicken, make sure your last stop of the day before heading home is the grocery store so the chicken doesn't get warm in your car. Also, avoid spending lots of time in the grocery store after picking up chicken. If it's warm outside, carry along an insulated bag or cooler to place the chicken in on your way home from the store in order to keep it cold.;
, While waiting for your groceries to be bagged (or when bagging them yourself), ask that your chicken be wrapped in a plastic bag to prevent leakage that could cross contaminate other vegetables, fruit or meat you may have purchased. This also applies when you put the chicken in your refrigerator when you get home.

, You can freeze the chicken in its original packaging or put it into an airtight, leak-proof container. If you plan on freezing it for two months or more, wrap the package with a freezer bag, freezer paper, tin foil or plastic wrap to help prevent your chicken or poultry from getting freezer burned. All poultry should be frozen at 0 degrees F (-18 degrees C).

, There are three main ways that are acceptable for defrosting chicken. Place it in your refrigerator (still wrapped up to prevent leakage) and allow it to thaw overnight or a full day. Run a sink full of cold water and place the wrapped chicken into it. Change the water every 30 minutes or so to ensure the chicken is defrosted gradually. It may take one to three hours to defrost it, depending on the size and type of poultry. (A whole turkey may take much longer.) You can microwave chicken to defrost it, but cook it immediately. Some parts of the chicken may have gotten warm, so it needs to be cooked as soon as possible.

, Check it with a meat thermometer.

, Touching other food items, or using utensils that touched the chicken on other food items, may transfer bacteria that can cause food-borne illnesses.

Show your kids how to add, and mix ingredients.,
Assign your kids the task of unwrapping, or tearing apart certain ingredients.,
Allow your kids to set and clear the dining room table.,
Allow your children to throw food and similar kitchen waste into the trash.,
Show your kids how to make certain meals safely on their own.",How to Let Kids Help in The Kitchen," Your kids must have a designated work space they can safely reach that is free of knives, hot burners, and other potentially dangerous items.


Clear a counter space for your kids, and allow them to stand on a stool to safely reach the counter. You could also give your kids tasks to perform at the kitchen table.;
, If you have more than one kid, you can designate certain tasks to each child, then rotate tasks so each child can share the experience equally. For example, allow one kid to put groceries away and the other to retrieve ingredients for lunch, then switch their roles the next time you come home from shopping.

, Most refrigerators and pantries are located within your kids' reach, so they can help you stock groceries and gather the ingredients for meals.

, Since rinsing fruits and vegetables consists of cleaning them under running water, this task is usually considered safe for children of all ages.

, Mixing ingredients together in a bowl is a task children of most ages can perform. For example, give your child small bowls of ingredients they can pour into a larger bowl, then mix together using a large spoon.

, Some recipes call for food items that must be broken apart or unwrapped before cooking; such as bananas, lettuce, hard-boiled eggs, oranges, and slices of cheese.

, Instructing your children to set and clear the table is a way you can allow them to help without necessarily having them in the kitchen. For example, have your kids count out the appropriate number of forks, spoons, napkins, and placemats for all family members, then have them place each item on the table.


Make sure your children are old enough to safely handle certain items such as sharp knives, or glassware before instructing them to set or clear the table. Knives and glass plates or cups may cause severe injury if dropped, or handled inappropriately and unsafely.

, You can instruct your kids to throw trash away as soon as it is available to avoid cluttering the kitchen with garbage.


Verify that certain trash items are safe to handle before giving them to your kids to throw away. For example, make sure can lids are safely stuffed into the bottom of cans to avoid major cuts and other injuries while handling.

, Examples of meals that don't require the use of a stove or oven are peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and vegetable or fruit salads.

Compost at home.,
Visit your local recycling centre.,
Use a local authority food waste scheme.",How to Dispose of Food1," Composting foods that can be organically disposed of at home is a great way to reduce the amount of food you throw in the trash. It’s good for the environment, and can give you some useful compost for the garden. Homemade compost will fertilize your soil and help with any gardening you do.


Use food scraps such as fruits and vegetables, coffee grounds, eggshells, nutshells and tea bags.
Do not dispose of meat, dairy or oils this way.
Add the food waste to cardboard, newspaper, vegetation and other organic materials in your compost pile. Mix it in with soil and dirt so the food can be broken down.
When you add new material to the pile, turn it with a garden fork or other tool to let fresh oxygen in to help with the composting process.
If you don’t have a yard, you can still compost at home with an earthworm farm.;
, If you don’t have the space, or are uncertain about composting at home, you can still deal with your food waste responsibly by visiting your local recycling centre. Lots of recycling centres will have facilities to deal with food waste and composting. Generally you will be able to bring your food waste and either leave it with someone there, or dump it into the appropriate container.


Be sure you check the specific guidelines for your centre before you go.
You may need to separate your food waste in a particular way before you take in it.
Make sure you know what food waste they accept and what they don’t.
For example, they will not take meat, but they will take organic waste, such as fruit and vegetables.
Your local government will be able to provide details on recycling facilities near you.

, Depending on where you live, you may be able to use a food waste scheme that is run by your local authority. It is becoming increasingly common for local authorities to provide a small food waste composting bin to households, which is then picked up alongside the regular trash collection.If you are uncertain about this, contact your local authority to find out if your neighbourhood is part of a scheme.
Talk to neighbours to find out if they know about it, and how you can get involved.
In these schemes you will often be provided with compostable bags to put your compostable food waste in."

Choose food preparation equipment in stainless steel whenever possible.,
Choose metal or melamine counter tops, if possible.",How to Maintain Food Processing Equipment to Prevent Food Poisoning1," Although you may not have the ability to replace the food processing equipment you have, the best way to ensure it is always maintained is to buy the right size and shape for your kitchen. Ensure the equipment is not too large or dangerous to move toward water, cleansers or scrubbing apparatus.;
, Wood is difficult to clean because of the fissures in its surface and cast iron rusts easily. Metal and plastic can be sterilized more easily.


If you have wooden cutting boards or other equipment made of wood or cast iron, buy special sterilizers to ensure the surfaces become sterile during the cleaning process.

, This material does not corrode or react with acids, fats, oils or meats, unlike other types of metal.

Check federal guidelines.,
Determine how food will be stored.,
Learn the terminology.,
Examine packaging.,
Take a look.,
Find the expiration date.,
Throw it out if you're not sure.",How to Determine the Shelf Life of Foods,"


Visit the official website of the Food and Drug Administration (http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/Labeling/ExpirationDating/ucm2005204.htm) to learn the shelf life of foods. The organization has clearly specified guidelines for refrigerating and freezing meat, dairy products and produce, and even offers a printable chart you can post on your refrigerator for quick reference. These guidelines will also provide a good basis for cleaning out your refrigerator.;
,


Fresh meats usually only last in the refrigerator for 1 or 2 days, but can last for a few months in the freezer. So, where your food will be stored will determine how long of a shelf life you can expect it to have.

,


It's important to understand the terminology and wording on food labels and packaging to figure out the shelf life of foods. Foods labeled ""use before"" are considered expired and potentially unsafe for consumption after that date. The label ""sell by"" is more of a guide for vendors. Foods are often safe for consumption for a day or 2 after that date. Pay attention to dates on packages and what they designate as a food's shelf life.

,


Inspect food packaging and wrapping for any tears, dents or leaks, as this could significantly lower the shelf life of food or make it unsafe to consume. Discard any meat with packaging that is torn. Re-wrap packages with small leaks in freezer paper to be safe and avoid contamination.

,


Throw away vegetables that are discolored or have a sour smell, as these are probably beginning to rot. Meat that is discolored should be discarded. Milk, yogurt and other dairy products that have a sour smell, look separated or are discolored should be thrown away, because they could be spoiled. Canned goods with rust or bulges should be discarded, because they could be compromised.

,


All perishable foods have expiration dates on their outer packaging to serve as a guide for determining the shelf life of the food. This date is usually near the bar code or nutritional information label on the packaging. Follow this date and discard items past their listed date.

,


Follow the ""better safe than sorry"" rule when figuring out the shelf life of perishable foods and discard food if you're unclear about its expiration date or safety.

Determine what food goods are suitable to donate.,
Contact local charities.,
Deliver it to the food centre.,
Donate food from a restaurant.,
Donate food from a grocery store.",How to Dispose of Food2," If you have food clogging up your cupboards that you are not going to eat, there is an alternative to just tossing it in the trash. Donating food to local charities, such as food banks and soup kitchens, is a great way to make sure nothing goes to waste. If you decide to do this, the first thing to do is determine what kind of food is suitable for you to donate.


Generally non-perishable food, such as tinned vegetables, soups, fish and meat are all appropriate.
Low-sugar cereal, tubs of peanut butter, raisins, and juice boxes are also very welcome.
Avoid using food in glass jars or containers. These may not be accepted because of the risk of them breaking.Remember you can also ask friends and family to see if they want anything too.

, Once you have an idea of what foods you have that may be suitable to donate, you need to look up some local charities. Search for food banks and food drives in your area, and call up to ask how to donate. You can search for your local food banks by using the online search tool of national hunger charities.There are special apps that help businesses to donate unwanted food.As an individual, it is best to work with an established charity, either local or national.

, Carefully pack up your food and then take your packages to your local food bank to deliver them to the staff and volunteers there. They will be happy to see you and accept your donation providing everything is packed well and you have not added in anything that is not an appropriate donation. While you’re at the food drive you could find out a little more about the work they do. Often they will be looking for new volunteers to help organise and distribute the donations.


If you have some spare time, why not get involved with the charity and volunteer with them.
There are normally a range of volunteering opportunities available., You can also donate excess food to charity if you run a restaurant. Contact a local charity with details about the food you wish to donate, and they will send a truck or van to come and collect from the restaurant. These schemes may also enable you to donate perishable and prepared foods, which will then be frozen or delivered immediately to a local shelter.You can find a list of organisations that perform this service on the US Department of Agriculture’s website: http://www.usda.gov/oce/foodwaste/resources/donations.htm


, You can also donate excess food from a grocery store or food wholesalers. The process is similar to that for restaurants and hotels. You will need to contact a local organisation and give them details on the excess food you would like to donate. The organisation will then arrange to pick up the food directly from you.


You could become a corporate partner of a local or national food charity if you are an organisation that frequently has food waste.
Being a corporate partner enables you to make a regular arrangement for donations and may offer your business tax benefits."

Separate spoiled foods.,
Collect oils and fats in a container.,
Use your garbage disposal.,
Don’t put food waste into a septic system.,
Know what foods you can just throw out.",How to Dispose of Food3," You should act fast to deal with any food that is spoiled or that will go bad quickly. Such foods should be separated from the rest of your trash, kept in heavy duty plastic bags and disposed of quickly.If practical, put meats and other foods that rot quickly into the trash on the day it will be collected. Rotting food will attract pests and insects.


Tie meats and any raw foods you are disposing of into plastic bags before you put them into your trash bag. This will minimize leaks and odours.
Ensure your trash can is fully secured and there is no odour that could attract pests.
Dispose of your meat quickly to avoid any potential problems with maggots.

, Dispose of cooking oils and fats by collecting them in a jar, tub, or other container that you don’t mind throwing away. Do not pour hot oil or fat from cooking meats down your sink drain. This will cause plumbing problems that may be expensive. You should always dispose of oil and grease in the trash, not down the drain.Throw the jar of fat into the trash when it gets full. Do not recycle the jar.
You can also use leftover fat (or suet) to make fat balls for your garden bird feeder.
Mix the fat with some dry kitchen scraps, such as porridge oats, and leave it to set in the fridge overnight.
Once it’s hard you can hang it from a tree or place it in a birdfeeder., If you have a garbage disposal attached to your sink, use it to dispose of food when you are cleaning up after a meal. Scrape food waste into your drain and turn on the disposal while running cold water. Listen for the grinding up of your food waste. Turn off the disposal and the water when you hear the blades return to their normal, empty position.


Remember not to put anything in your disposal that is not biodegradable.
Don’t put anything like glass, metal, plastic or paper in there.
Don’t pour grease or oil in your garbage disposal.
Don’t put expandable food, like rice or pasta, in there., Putting food waste in your septic system should be avoided. If you have a septic system take care not to wash food scraps, coffee grounds, oils or fats down the sink. The more solids that make it into your take, the more often it will need to be pumped.If you have a grinder or garbage disposal in your house try to limit the amount you use it as much as possible.
Using a garbage disposal may affect the warranty on your septic system.

, There are some foods that are inappropriate for composting or recycling, such as dried pasta, rice, bread and other grains. Dried foods like pasta and rice can be good to donate to food banks, and they generally have a very long shelf-life, so you shouldn't have to throw much away.


If you do find some really old pasta or rice at the back of the cupboard you can just toss it in the trash.
You may be tempted to feed stale bread to birds in your garden, but it has little nutritional value. Mouldy bread can even harm birds.Dairy products cannot be recycled or composted and should just be thrown in the trash."

Store food effectively.,
Shop smart.,
Make the most of leftovers.",How to Dispose of Food4," Take some steps to help you reduce the amount of food waste you produce in the long-term. Often if we store food incorrectly it goes bad before it’s time, or it has a very limited lifespan. By taking the time to store food more effectively you can waste less and get better value for money.


Freeze any fresh foods that you will not use right away so you can use them at a later date.
Consider freezing leftovers such as soups, stews and pastas.
Make sure all your storage containers are secure and kept in the appropriate climactic conditions.
For example, some foods need to be kept in the fridge, and others should be in kept in a cool, dry place.

, A simple way to reduce your food waste is to buy less food. Pay attention to how much you normally throw away, and try to make some adjustments to your grocery shop accordingly. A great way to do this is to plan out your meals for the week and then just buy what you need to make those dishes.


Be wary of special offers and buy-one-get-one-free deals.
If you cannot store the extra food, ask yourself if you will just end up throwing it away., Another great way to cut down on food waste, and really get the most of the food you buy, is to make the most of your leftovers. You can turn leftovers into extra meals or snacks, or use them to make stocks and stews. Look for recipes that use what you have left. Aim to use every bit of food that you cooked. You can find a host of helpful recipes for leftovers online.Preserve or can any fruits and vegetables that you have a surplus of.
Be sure you use leftovers safely. Pack them properly in airtight containers, and keep them in the fridge or freezer.
Use leftovers within two days, and don’t reheat food more than once."

Boil the eggs.,
Cool the eggs.,
Crack the shell at each end.,
Peel the egg.",How to Peel an Egg1," The method you use to boil your eggs can have a significant impact on how easily you'll be able to peel them. Place your eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. There should be about two inches of water over the top of the eggs. Add a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda to the water, then bring the pan to a gentle simmer and cook for approximately 12 minutes.








The bicarbonate of soda raises the pH level of the egg white, which causes it to stick less to the shell and membrane when peeling.Fresh eggs will be harder to peel than slightly older eggs, as the air pocket at the wide end of the egg is smaller in fresh eggs. For this reason, you should avoid boiling freshly laid eggs, whenever possible.Go for 3-5 day old eggs instead.;
, Once the eggs have finished cooking, drain the water from the saucepan then refill it with cold water. You can add some ice cubes to the water, if you like. The cold water causes the egg to contract inside the shell, creating more space, which makes the egg easier to peel.







, Once the eggs have cooled, remove them from the water and pat dry with some paper towel. Take an egg and firmly tap each end on a hard surface, such as a counter top, to crack the shell. Do one end, and then the other.









There is an air bubble in the wide end of the egg; once you have crushed this, the egg will be easier to peel.
Rather than cracking the egg on a hard surface, you can use the back of a tablespoon to break the shell. One or two firm taps should do it.

, Starting at the wide end with the air pocket, begin peeling the egg, using the side of your thumb. You should remove both the shell and the white, filmy membrane, to reveal the smooth, shiny egg white underneath.If the boiled egg has adequately cooked and cooled, the shell should come away easily.

This way you don’t end up with bits of potato skin all over your kitchen. There are two generic ""shapes"" potato peelers; here's how to hold each one:


If you have a standard long potato peeler, hold it like a paint roller, with your thumb balancing it in your fingers, but still away from the blade.
If you have a Y-shaped potato peeler, hold it like a pencil. This way is more efficient, and you’re less likely to hurt yourself. It should be resting between your middle finger and thumb (of your dominant hand), with your pointer finger holding it in position.;
, Imagine drawing a line with the peeler going away from you, with your elbow pointing out, away from your body. Start at the base and try to make one swift motion all the way up the potato. Ideally, you should be peeling off the skin in strips.









This goes for both shapes of potato peelers, even the y-shaped ones. Though it's possible grandma held it differently and drew it into her, this way you'll find results in a much cleaner potato.
Some potatoes are a bit fussier than others and the skin will come off in chunks – especially if the potato isn’t smooth and round. Pay special attention to these areas to get every last bit off; they'll need extra work (and a slower peel, lest you hurt yourself).

, As you get one side done, rotate it in your hand, developing a rhythm of peeling and rotating, peeling and rotating. Don't worry about peeling the top and bottom just yet.









This isn't a speed contest; go as slowly and patiently as you have to to avoid hurting yourself or taking off the good parts of the potato. Going slowly at first can help you perfect your technique for later, too.

, You may find that as you expose the inside of the potato, you see dark spots. This is pretty normal – few potatoes are perfect. Focus on this area and keep peeling until you’ve peeled away the dark layers entirely.









Sometimes the dark “meat” of the potato goes pretty deep (this is often called an ""eye""). If this is the case, cut out the area with a knife or the edge of your peeler. The potato won't be perfectly round, but it'll still be good to eat.

, This part is sort of like shaving your knees – maneuver the peeler around the curves as best you can, going back to those teeny spots you inevitably end up missing.









Rinse with cold water when finished. Your potatoes are then clean and ready to be prepared.

",How to Peel a Pomelo," The knife should cut about 1/2 an inch into the rind.;
, Again, cut about 1/2 an inch into the rind. Pull the slices off the fruit. Dig your fingers underneath the slice at the top (where you cut the cap) and pull each one firmly away. It feels almost like working with styrofoam.

, You'll be left with a much smaller fruit, covered in white membrane.

If you have a compost pile, throw the rind in there. Or, you can make a marmalade from it, or it can be candied.







,, It should start breaking into slices. Some force (prying) is required. You can make this easier by cutting away some of the tough membrane surrounding the fruit, but this isn't necessary, and you risk cutting into the flesh (which is not good if you want neat slices).

, It helps a lot to cut the membrane that runs along the center of the fruit, and the membrane at each end--that way, all you have left are ""flaps"" between each slice.


The membrane along the bottom of the slice (exterior of the fruit) will be hard to remove, and is better left on the flesh if you want the slices to stay intact.
Otherwise, pull the flesh away from the membrane in chunks and direct those chunks into your mouth, or Make Thai Pomelo Salad With Grilled Prawns.

Take a banana that isn't overly ripe.,
Hold either side of the banana, placing it in a smiling shape.,
Snap it in half, downwards.,
Peel each banana half and enjoy.",How to Peel a Banana2," If it's too ripe, you may find yourself in the middle of a mushy disaster if you try to snap it.








, Make sure the banana is ""smiling"" or making a ""U"" shape, instead of frowning, or making the upside-down ""U"" shape. If it's pointed in the wrong direction, it'll be hard to snap it open. Think of it this way -- if the banana is ""frowning,"" then you'll be frowning too, when you're unable to peel it.








, Use both hands to crisply snap the banana in half, like you're breaking a Kit-Kat bar. You'll need to apply some force, but not too much here. Remember, if the banana is too ripe, the skin will be softer, making it tougher to snap.








, Now, just peel the skin off each banana half and enjoy your tasty fruit. Do what you would do traditionally, by peeling the skin from the top down. The skin will most likely still be connected -- it's tough to truly snap it in half -- so peeling both halves may take some finesse. You can try to break the connecting skin first and then peel one half, eat it, and then repeat with the other half.








"
"
Find a sharp knife.,
Cut the banana from the tip to the handle.,
Cut each half down the middle horizontally.,
Peel the skin off the four pieces.",How to Peel a Banana3," The sharper the knife, the easier it'll be able to cut through the skin of the banana. You should also get a cutting board so you can cut the banana on a thick, safe surface.








, Place the banana on the cutting board and slice it from the very tip all the way to the handle. If the handle/stem is a little tough, you can use your hands to split them apart at the end.








, Now, place the two halves on the cutting board and cut them horizontally, to create four parts that are about the same size.








, Now, just hold up each piece and gently peel the skin away from the fruit. This is an ideal method if you want to treat others to the banana, or if you want to enjoy the banana more slowly, in sections. It also just looks kind of cool! You're all done.








"
"
Hold the stem of the banana so that it curves toward you.,
Snap the banana forward, like you're cracking a whip.,
Peel the rest of the banana the normal way.",How to Peel a Banana4," Take the stem in your dominant (throwing) hand and make sure that the banana is curving toward, and not away from you. Stand over a cutting board, a table, or something else that can stop the banana from flying out too far away from you.








, Hold on to the stem and thrust your hand and the banana outward in a natural motion that curves downward. Just snap your wrist and use enough force to fling the banana forward. If done successfully, you should be left holding onto the stem and a sliver of peeled banana skin. If it doesn't work the first time, then try, try again -- this method does take some practice.








, Now that you've already peeled off a sliver of banana, you can peel the banana the traditional way, from the bottom up, before you enjoy your treat. This method definitely gets creativity and flashiness points.








"
"
Make a tiny cut in the surface of the top of the stem.,
Peel the banana stem back so the skin breaks where the cut was made and peel it down all the way.",How to Peel a Banana5," Make the cut on the inner side of the curve of the banana (inside the ""U"" shape). This works best if you have a banana that is medium ripe, so that you don't mush the banana too much. And the sharper your nails, the better.








, If you do this correctly, it won't mush the banana. Once you've made the cut, just use the opening to peel back the rest of the banana skin. This is a fun variation on peeling a banana the regular way.








"
"
Hold the banana in both hands.,
Twist the banana carefully without squeezing it.,
Peel the banana the rest of the way.",How to Peel a Banana6," Leave about 2-3 inches (5-7.5 cm) between your hands so you have some space when you twist the banana.








, You should give it a quarter to a half twist, or just enough for the skin of the banana to break.








, Now that you've broken the banana open, you can peel back the sides and enjoy your banana.

Buy or grow a kiwifruit.,
Wash the kiwifruit.,
Chop the kiwifruit in half, across the widest part.,
Cut the kiwifruit into circular slices.",How to Cut a Kiwi1," The fruit should be a brown-green color and have short, fuzzy hairs. Hold it in your palm and give it a light squeeze to feel whether the kiwifruit is soft. If it's too soft, it might have gone bad. Try to pick a medium soft kiwifruit as it will be just right to eat straight away.






;
, Washing the kiwifruit ensures that any possible contaminants on the skin, such as bacteria, are not transferred to the fruit itself. This way you will not get sick.








, Use a clean, sharp fruit knife and a chopping board. Depending on the ripeness of the fruit, the knife should cut right through. If it's still a little hard, you may need to slice again to cut through the core.









At this point, you can eat the kiwifruit as it is, scooping the flesh out of the skin with a spoon, like you would eat a boiled egg.
Some people prefer to remove the small, black seeds from the kiwifruit, but this is completely optional as the seeds are perfectly edible.

, For smaller, more decorative slices of kiwifruit, cut the entire fruit into circular slices, working from one end to the other, discarding the end pieces. Then cut through the diameter of each circle to form small, kiwifruit semicircles.









These kiwifruit slices make a great addition to a decorative fruit salad and add a splash of tropical color to the tops of cakes, pavlovas and other desserts.
They also make a great bite-sized snack for small children and work well in school lunches. If you want to remove the skin before chopping, just follow the method below.

Remove a little bit of shell from each end of the egg.,
Roll the egg between your hands or on a hard surface to loosen the shell from the egg.,
Hold the egg in your right hand.,
Form a circle with the thumb and index finger of your right hand that is about the same size as the opening on the smaller end of the egg.,
Place your left hand under and around your right hand, cupping the egg.,
Bring your hands and the egg to your mouth, forming a seal between your lips and the circle formed with your right hand.

,
Take a deep breath and blow hard.,
Rinse your hard-boiled treasure to remove any small pieces of shell left behind.

",How to Blow the Shell off a Hard Boiled Egg," It helps to gently hit the ends against a hard surface to create small cracks. Do this to an area about the size of a dime on the smaller end (18 mm diameter) and about the size of a nickel on the larger end (21 mm diameter).;
, This should produce small cracks throughout the shell.

, Keep the smaller end toward you.

, Be sure your thumb is over your index finger. Place the thumb/index finger circle over the opening on the small end.

, Be sure that your fingers fit together and make a seal. This seal is key in directing all the air into the shell and not letting it escape around it.

,, It takes more air pressure than you think to push the egg from its shell. If necessary, repeat until the egg is out.

Place your potatoes in a large pot with plenty of water.,
If you’d like, score your potatoes.,
Bring it to a boil for about 15 minutes.,
When they’re cooked through, immerse them one by one in ice cold water for 5-10 seconds.,
Peel off the skin.",How to Peel a Potato2," You want a pot that's large enough for your potatoes to be well covered with water and not to be too cramped. Aim for at least 1 or 2 inches (2.5 - 5 cm) of water on top of the potatoes.

, You may find that the skin comes off easier (or at the very least, is easier to grip) with the potatoes scored. Just make a line into the skin (only about ¼ inch deep (.6 cm) around the center of the potato, like an equator.









Don't make the cut too deep; it just needs to go past the layer of skin. Try to cut every potato evenly so each one cooks evenly, too.

, A good-size pot with 6 or 7 potatoes will take around 15 minutes to cook through. You’ll need more or less time depending on how many you’re dealing with. When you think they’re done, pierce one with a fork – if it punctures the skin and then slides right in, you’re good to go.









Don't even worry about draining the pot just yet – move right onto the next step so the potatoes' heat is preserved.

, Have a bowl of ice water ready for when your potatoes are done. With your tongs (do not touch the potatoes directly), grab each potato and put it in the bowl of ice cold water.









They don’t need to be left in there for too long to cool down – 5 -10 seconds is plenty.
With each potato, you may need to add an ice cube or two to the water; the heat of the potato will likely have transferred.

, Here’s the magic: with just your fingers applying pressure to the skin, it will come right off, like a tablecloth. If you've scored the potato, place your thumbs on this line and pull toward the end of the potato, leaving a skinless potato in your wake.









Dispose of the skin one by one in the garbage (or in a designated bowl next to you), to keep the bowl of ice water clean and as cold as possible.

Cut the stem end from the body of the pepper.,
Cut the ribs and seeds away from the flesh.,
Remove the remaining seeds.,
Cut crosswise into rings (optional).",How to Cut a Bell Pepper1," Most cooks will find it easiest to lay the pepper on its side, the stem toward your strong side (the right if you’re a righty), and then cut crosswise just below the “shoulders.” The entire stem and its base should come off in one piece.









Depending on the pepper, there may be quite a bit of flesh remaining attached to the stem, which can be cut free and chopped if desired.
Alternatively, the point of a sharp paring or similar knife can be inserted between the stem and the shoulder. Then rotate the pepper in one hand while holding the knife firmly in the other. The stem should come away cleanly.;
, Start by turning the pepper so its opening faces you. Insert the point of a smallish, sharp knife (such as a paring knife) into the pepper and cut through the ribs close to the flesh. Rotate the pepper’s body and continue cutting until all the ribs and seeds are loose, and remove.









When using hot peppers, don't touch your eyes or other sensitive areas until you've washed your hands thoroughly, preferably in an acidic solution (a little vinegar or lemon juice does the trick). Wearing gloves may be wise with very hot peppers.

, Bang the pepper's opening against your hand or a cutting board, or rinse under cold water.








, Turn the pepper sideways as in step 1 above. Cut crosswise into thin or thick rings, as desired.

Hold the banana horizontally in one hand.,
Cut off each side of the banana.,
Slice the banana skin lengthwise and then peel off the entire skin.,
Enjoy.",How to Peel a Banana7," When you're holding it correctly, you should place it down on a cutting board as it is.








, Use one quick swift cut of the knife to slice off the ends of each side of the banana.








, Be careful when you're doing this. Cut the banana peel gently so you don't slice through it or hurt the hand that is holding on to it. Once you cut it, just peel back the skin.








, This method works great if you're planning on slicing the banana to use it in a salad, or if you just like eating a banana without a peel.








"
"
Hold the banana in your hand, stem pointing up.,
Snap off the stem and peel the skin downward.,
Enjoy.",How to Peel a Banana8," It'll be easier to snap the stem back if it's positioned this way.








, Once you've done that, you can continue peeling the rest of the banana downward, in one or two more strips. This is the most common way to peel a banana, so chances are that you're already familiar with it.








, Now eat your tasty banana, biting into it and peeling it back further and further until you've eaten the whole thing.

Cut the ends off the kiwifruit.,
Insert a spoon between the skin and flesh of the kiwifruit.,
Rotate the spoon around the kiwifruit, beneath the skin.,
Pop the fruit from the skin.,
Slice the kiwifruit vertically in half.",How to Cut a Kiwi2," Place the kiwifruit on a chopping board and carefully slice off both ends of the fruit, using a small knife. Don't worry about wasting the fruit, you will need to expose a decent amount of the kiwi fruit's green flesh in order for this method to work.








, You can use a regular tablespoon to do this. Try to get the spoon as closely underneath the skin as possible, as this will make the fruit easier to remove.








, This will loosen the skin from the fruit. Depending on the size of the spoon, you may need to work on one side of the kiwi first, then switch to the other side to loosen all of the skin.








, Once all of the skin has been loosened, you should easily be able to slide the entire kiwi fruit out, leaving you with a perfectly smooth, cylindrical fruit.









It is also possible to just peel the kiwifruit with a knife, but you will inevitably remove some of the fruit doing it this way, and end up with a strangely-shaped kiwifruit.

, Then slice each half again to form little kiwifruit wedges, perfect for fruit salads or a prettily arranged fruit plate. Alternatively, you can easily dice the kiwifruit into cubes of any size.

Make a thin slice at the bottom so the cucumber can stand up .

,
Position the cut petals with your fingers.,
Remove the seed portion of the cucumber.,
Trim and enhance the petals.,
Re-shape the petals and add a small vegetable or dip garnish to the middle of the cucumber.",How to Create a Cucumber Flower," Allow time to dry. Because the skin is waxy, you may need to help dry time by dabbing cucumbers with a clean paper towel.;
, Make a clean, straight line cut across the middle of the cucumber so you end up with two pieces.

, Make thin, clean horizontal cuts around the skin of the cucumber. When you cut, be sure you include some pieces of the cucumber flesh along with the skin. Cuts should be very thin and spaced evenly around the cucumber.


Cut almost to the bottom of the cucumber (away from the open, pre-cut portion) but not all the way through. The petals must stay intact.







,, Carefully pull every other petal outward in a stagger fashion so the petals start to take form/shape.

, Hollow out the middle portion of the cucumber with the paring knife. Carefully cut around the seed area and remove. Remove any remaining seeds with your knife so that you have a hollowed base.

, Make the petals look more like a flower by trimming the tops of the cucumber petals on a diagonal. Remove each petal corner or every other petal corner to add interest and elegance.

, You could add a few carrot strings or even a dollop of dressing.

Repeat this process three more times around the center of the apple.,
Insert the knife back into one of the incisions.,
Remove the knife and push out the core with your thumbs.",How to Core Apples1," The stem should be facing up.






;
, You should insert it about one centimeter from the center of the apple to avoid inserting it directly into the core.








, Do it slowly, so you don't cut yourself. Make sure that the knife pokes through the bottom of the apple, so you can see the blade.








, Do this slowly and carefully. Watch where you place your fingers. If the knife does slide out more quickly than you expect, the blade should not go anywhere near your fingers or palm.








, When you're finished, you should have made four incisions to create a square around the center of the apple.








, Drag it from the first incision to the second, and all the way through the other two incisions, until you have completely cut around the apple's core.








, Push it down through the apple until it pops out.

Peel the main flesh of the pepper (optional).,
Separate the flesh along the pleats.,
Peel the remaining flesh (optional).,
Remove the veins and seeds.,
Cut lengthwise into julienne strips.,
Dice the strips (optional).",How to Cut a Bell Pepper2," Using a good vegetable peeler, serrated or not, start at the rounded shoulders and peel toward the point. You won't be able to peel everything, because some parts will be in the dents or pleats, and not accessible to the flat blade.








Peeling peppers makes them more delicate to bite and flavor. The skins are somewhat bitter, especially with green peppers, as well as being tough to chew.

, Place the pepper point-side down on a cutting board, or hold firmly in your off-hand if you're comfortable cutting in-hand. Insert a sharp knife’s point into the top of each pleat, at the stem, and cut downward until you reach the point. Rotate the pepper and repeat until the flesh is separated into sections. Pull the sections outward, away from the stem, and they'll break off neatly.








, Now that all the flesh is accessible, complete the peeling process.








, Lay the sections flat on the board, and either cut the veins and seeds free or else pinch and pull them off with your fingers. Cutting is cleaner and faster, but it does mean using a knife quite close to the off-hand fingers.








Most of the seeds and veins will have been removed in step 2, but there will likely be some still stuck here and there. If you’re not looking for perfectly clean julienne or dice, you may be able to skip this step.

, Turn the sections so they run front-to-back, parallel to your knife. With a smooth cutting motion guided by the knuckles of your off hand, cut the flesh into strips of the desired thinness.








, Rotate the julienne strips 90 degrees on the board and cut again as before, creating even dice.







"
"
Cut the pepper in half lengthwise.,
Remove the stem from both halves.,
Pull out the ribs.,
Remove the remaining seeds.,
Cut in strips.,
Dice (optional).",How to Cut a Bell Pepper3," Stand the pepper on its point. Using a large, sharp knife (chef's knife, etc.), cut straight down through the base of the stem and to the point, splitting the pepper.








, With the point of the knife (a paring knife is probably easier for this part), cut around where the stem part meets the flesh, and discard the stem.








, With the knife or your fingers, cut or pull out all the whitish ribs.








, Bang the pepper halves, open-end down, on the cutting board or your open hand.








, Lay the pepper skin-side down, with the point end toward you. With your knife and off-hand in the usual position, knuckles guiding blade, cut in strips.








, Turn the strips 90 degrees on the board and cut as before.









This method is faster than the previous one, but it's also less delicate. You can't get the peel off fully, for one thing. In addition, this method will tend to break the flesh here and there a little bit.

Use a very sharp knife when cutting onions.,
Chill the onions in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes before cutting them.,
Cut the onion under water.,
Cut the onion near hot running water or a cloud of steam.,
Breathe through your mouth and stick your tongue out.,
Soak the onion in water.,
Point your knife away from the tubes.,
Whistle while you work.,
Stick a piece of bread in your mouth.,
Wear gas-tight goggles or a mask.,
Cut the onion next to a strong draught from a fume hood, fan, or window.,
Use some type of acidic solution.,
Use the candle method.",How to Chop Onions Without Tears," The enzymes are released when cells are broken or crushed; using a sharp knife slices through the onion rather than crushing and thus, fewer enzymes are released. Regardless of whether you employ different tactics too, use a sharp knife in every onion-cutting situation. It'll go that much quicker!;
, This reduces the amount of the acid enzyme released into the air and has zero effect on taste. This was found to be the most effective way to reduce tears by the television program Food Detectives.


The fridge can do it, too; just make sure not to keep them next to apples or potatoes, or leave them in there for too long (20 minutes should do it) -- they can cause odors if you do.

, This is an effective method, but the problem is that it's a bit difficult to maneuver. In the water, the onion bits go every where unless you hold onto them and then scooping them up and draining out the onion water and it can all just not be worth it if you don't execute it right. If you choose this method, plan out your attack beforehand.









Some say to do it under running water, but this is a bit tricky, too, obviously. The gushing water makes everything go a little haywire in your hands.

, Steam from a kettle or pan of water will do the trick. The science here is that the steam will draw out the vapors from the onion, dissipating them.








, This draws the gas over your wet tongue. The olfactory nerves, which are closely located to the tear duct nerves, will be by bypassed and there will be no tears generated. This is easily confirmed when you forget and breathe through your nose. Instant tears!








, The enzyme is denatured by the water-air boundary. However, do know that this eliminates some flavor and that the onion is a little more slippery than normal (making it harder to deal with). If milder onions are okay for you, give this method a shot.








, Because onion ""flesh"" is tubular in construction, pointing the tubes away from you while cutting will keep the onion from spraying in your eyes.









Of course, a breeze of any kind can send the fine, misty spray toward your eyes, so pay attention to air currents too. Turn that fan on -- and point it in the right direction!

, Whistling makes a significant airflow, specifically away from your face, which keeps the onion mist away from your eyes. Just pick a catchy tune that you won't want to stop whistling and you can cut as many onions as you need.

, Many people report that chewing, especially bread, helps avoid tears when cutting onions. Chew very slowly, letting the bread hang out of your mouth a little. Your mouth will water, which will be a little uncomfortable, but your eyes won't!


Others say to chew gum. There's no real reason this might work, but you could give it a shot!

, If you have a pair of swimmer's goggles or chemistry goggles that fit your face, this is one of your best bets. No onion air will be getting in there! But if they don't fit your face, you're just cutting an onion with weird glasses on, crying all the while.


Be wary of the one-size-fits-all onion goggles you can find online. The odds of them fitting aren't 100%. And if you have glasses? You're better off with a different method.

, This is so that the gas is pulled away from your eyes. Get to chopping on your stove and use the vent (be sure to blast it at full power) that comes up above. Or just get next to an open window or get outside and enjoy the breeze.

, An ionic or acidic solution can denature the enzyme. Here's a couple home remedy solutions from around the house:









Put vinegar on the chopping board. The acid denatures the enzyme.
Soak the onion in salt water. The ionic solution denatures the enzyme. But do know that this can change the flavor.

, Light a candle and set it near the cutting board before cutting the onion. The gas released by the onion is drawn into the flame of a candle.









Not your best bet, however. Some say it just masks the smell and doesn't actually work. But hey, your kitchen will smell nice!
Remember to blow it out after you're finished cutting the onions.

Check for any damage or blemishes.,
Trim the ends.,
Remove the string.,
Thinly slice.,
Dry them thoroughly.,
Cook or store as preferred.,
Eat them raw.",How to Clean Snow Peas," A mature snow pea can be up to 3 inches in length. Select ones with smooth, not wrinkly, skin. They should have a solid green skin free of any cracks. The pods should be fairly flat, indicating small sized peas. If the peas are too big, the pod is overgrown and will be tough in texture.A tiny petal at the stem of the pod is a sign that it is fresh and ready to be eaten or stored.;
, Once you’ve bought or harvested your pods, they can be stored in a sealed plastic bag for a maximum of three days. They will need to be refrigerated to preserve freshness during this time. Be wary of extending the storage period beyond just a few days as it will impact the taste of the pods., Before you start to handle your produce, go ahead and rinse your hands off under some warm water. Use soap as well to ensure maximum cleanliness. Dry off your hands. Repeat handwashing as often as desired.

, Empty your pods into a strainer or colander. Make sure that there is enough space for the pods to fully fit without falling out or spilling over. Depending on the size of the colander and the number of pods, you may need to repeat this step multiple times.

, Hold the colander under cool water. Use your extra hand to stir to pea pods to ensure that they all get washed thoroughly. If one pod looks particularly dirty, pick it out with your hands and lightly scrub it with your fingers., You can also get a bowl and mix together a 90% vinegar 10% water solution inside. Place the pea pods into the bowl and let them soak for 15-20 minutes. This should remove any remaining pesticide residue. However, be aware that keeping the pods in the solution between the specified time can damage the skin and impact the texture.Washing your pods in a 2% salt water mixture can also provide a deeper clean.

, After you finish washing the pods, look them over to see if there are any yellow spots on the skin. Remove and discard those pods with spots or cuts. It is possible to trim away the impacted portion of the pod with a sharp knife, but the peas inside may be damaged., Remove the peas from the colander one-by-one and place them on a cutting board. Using a paring knife, trim away both ends of the pod. Don’t trim too far into the pod itself, just cut away the hard ends., Once the ends are removed, you will see a string running the length of the pod. Use your fingers to pull this string out or pin the string against your knife blade and tug it out that way. Dispose of the string., If you prefer, set the trimmed pea pod back onto the cutting board and use your paring knife to cut the pod diagonally into equally sized slices. You can also skip this step and leave the pod intact., If you plan to store your pods, it is especially important to remove all moisture from their skin. Lay them out on a towel and lightly press another fresh towel on top of them. Or, pick up a handful of pods at a time and rub them with a towel. This will prevent ice crystals from forming in the colder temperatures of the refrigerator., If you decide to cook your snow peas, you will want to do so right away. It only takes 1-2 minutes to cook the peas via a steam or stir-fry method. If you choose to store the pods, then they will keep in the fridge for up to 4 days., Be aware that you can also eat snow peas raw directly after cleaning. This guarantees the best flavor. You will notice that the fresh peas have a firm, crunchy texture."

Insert a sharp object between the halves of the shell.,
Pry the shell open.,
Discard the top half of the shell.,
Remove the dark innards.,
Remove the scallop from the shell.,
Run the scallop under cold water.,
Rub the scallop with your fingers.,
Remove any remaining side muscle.,
Rinse the scallop again after removing the side muscle.",How to Clean Scallops," This will allow them to open with ease. Warmer scallops are very difficult to open. You could also store your scallops in the refrigerator., Turn the specimen so that the darkest side of the shelled scallop is facing towards you. The hinge of the shell should be pointed away from you.The darker side is the top of the shell and will not have the scallop attached to it. This will allow you to remove the darker half of the shell without discarding the scallop.

, Take a paring knife or spoon and insert it between the top and bottom halves of the shell. This will allow you to pry it open.Don’t insert the knife too deeply into the shell or you might damage the scallop. Depending on the size of the shell and scallop, you could insert the knife about an inch (about 2.5cm) into the shell without cutting the scallop.

, Apply pressure to the knife or spoon to slowly open the shell. Find where the scallop's muscle meets the top half of the shell and cut through it. When you cut through this muscle, you will disengage the top half of the shell from the bottom half, allowing the shell to open., Throw the top half of the shell (the darker half) away once you have cut away the attachment. You now only need the bottom half, which will be holding the scallop.To remove the top half, simply pull it upwards and break it apart from the lower half at its hinge.

, Clean the inside of the scallop shell of everything but the muscle. Remove all of the dark parts of scallop, leaving the white muscle inside the shell.When doing this, you should scrape the innards off of the muscle using your paring knife or spoon. This can be done easily and in one swipe if you begin scraping at the hinge and follow along the muscle in one clean movement.

, Detach the muscle from the shell once you have removed the innards from the inside of the shell. You can do this by inserting a paring knife or sharpened spoon underneath the scallop's muscle and dislodging the muscle from the shell.You should have no trouble removing the muscle.
You can discard the lower half of the shell after removing the scallop.

, Putting your scallop under water will wash away impurities and get rid of sand and other grit. Run it under cold water for at least 30 seconds., This will make sure that all impurities have been removed from the scallop. Do this while holding it under running water or place the scallop in a bowl of cold water to rinse off any grit.Sometimes, sand or grit will remain on the scallop but be invisible to the eye. Rubbing the scallop ensures that you are getting all the impurities that might not be visible to you.

, While you are washing the scallop, you might find other remaining innards or a side muscle. Remove all of these by gently pulling or cutting them off. The only thing left should be the round white muscle.Remaining side muscle can be inconspicuous. To determine if what you're touching is side muscle, examine the scallop and feel for tougher pieces of muscle on the side of the scallop. If these tough pieces also have fibers that run against the grain of the scallop's muscle, then these are side muscles and can be removed.
It is important to remove side muscle because it doesn’t cook well. It will become rubbery when cooked., Give the scallop one good final rinse after removing the side muscle. This will wash away any remaining residue. Your scallop is now ready to be cooked!"

Use your potatoes.",How to Clean Potatoes in the Dishwasher," If needed, peel your potatoes thoroughly with a potato peeler. This is optional and can be done after you've cleaned the potatoes, but you can also do it ahead of time if you prefer. , Get each potato and insert them in the top rack of the dishwasher. Consider placing the jumbo potatoes near each other, and the smaller ones next to each other to organize them neatly. , Place the dishwasher onto a rinse-only cycle using cold water with no soap or detergent. It's important to use cold water because hot water causes the potatoes to steam slightly, causing them to be soggy once they've been washed and get boiled or baked. If your dishwasher doesn’t have a way to control the temperature, use cold water by making sure there’s no hot water in the tank. Do it right after everybody takes their shower and you’ve done all the laundry that uses hot or warm water, making sure to not use the heat dry setting. If you do end up using hot water, be sure to place the potatoes in the freezer or fridge immediately after they've been cleaned so they can cool off and not steam. , Once the dishwasher has shut off, usually taking about an hour or less depending on your dishwasher, remove each potato out of the top rack. Place each one on your kitchen counter to set aside so you can dry them., Using a small towel or rag, wipe each potato thoroughly until each one is longer wet and is completely dry., Once your potatoes have been cleaned and dried, you can begin using them to make your meal. Enjoy!

Scrub the potato using a circular motion.,
Rinse the scrubber and potato.,
Repeat the scrubbing and rinsing until your potato is lighter than it was before.,
Pat the potato dry with a paper towel, then move onto the next one.",How to Clean Potatoes1," Be sure to wash your hands first using an antibacterial soap, and to rinse them well. You don't want to transfer any bacteria to your clean potatoes.Wash the potatoes just before you plan to cook and eat them. Do not wash the potatoes before storing them, as this could lead to early rot and spoilage.;
, Organic potatoes may be free of chemicals and pesticides, but they will still be covered with dirt and bacteria. You also want to wash potatoes that you plan on peeling. If you don't wash them first, you might end up dragging some of the bacteria or dirt onto the flesh when you go to peel them., Try to avoid using the same scrubber you use for your dishes. It may contain some soap residue, which might get onto the potato.


If you don't have a vegetable scrubbing brush, find a clean sponge with a scratchy, scrubby side, and use that instead.

, Focus on any dirty areas as well as the eyes, where most of the dirt collects.Do not use any soaps, detergents, or produce cleaners. You may not end up getting all of the residue off. Also, research has proven that a simple scrubbing is pretty effective.If you notice any sprouts, pull them off. Don't leave them on the potato.

, Overtime, the scrubber may start to turn off-color. If this happens, simply rinse both the scrubber and the potato under water.

, If you have a white dish scrubber, you can wait until it stops getting off-color. If you don't, wait until the potato is a few shades lighter. It may have splotches of different colors. That's fine.

, This can help remove any leftover dirt and bacteria."

, You can find them in make up shops and in the beauty section of a department store. They are usually made of a coarse, scrubby material.Make sure that the glove is new. Use it only for washing potatoes. Do not use it again to exfoliate your body.

, You will be using the glove to scrub the dirt away.

, If you are concerned about wasting water, turn the faucet off. Do not use any soap, dish detergent, or produce cleaner. If you use these, you may not get all of the residue off the potato.

, Roll and turn and tumble the potato in your hand. The glove's scrubby material will act like a vegetable scrubber, and buff the dirty away.

, The potato should be a little lighter in color than before. If you need to, repeat the scrubbing and rinsing process.

, Drying the potato off may also help wipe off any extra dirt and bacteria.

, If it is very dirty, add some soap, but make sure that you rinse it out completely.

Clean with water.,
Don't use cleaning detergents with added scents.,
Douse the cabbage in vinegar water, if desired.",How to Clean Cabbage," Taking your cabbage, place it underneath the running water. Using your hands or a vegetable scrubber, gently start scrubbing the cabbage. Make sure to leave no space uncleaned. Also make sure not to miss cleaning the inside as well. Sometimes dirt can be hidden deep within so make sure to be thorough. When finished cleaning, pat down dry with a paper towel.;
, For general use in the kitchen, avoid using cleaning detergents with added scents. They can leave an unwanted taste on the food or contaminant the food. Also a tip to bear in mind is not to use scented detergents with cooking utensils as well.

, An old trick to use is to leave the cabbage lightly doused in vinegar water for a couple of minutes before proceeding to wash the cabbage with water. Usually between two or four minutes. Vinegar kills some types of bacteria and helps killing mold and mildew that could have grown on the cabbage.

Wipe the caps with a damp cloth or paper towel.,
Remove the stems and discard them.,
Scrape out the dark gills on the underside of the caps.,
Score whole caps on the top side (optional).",How to Clean Portobello Mushrooms1," Mushrooms are spongy and can soak up moisture quickly. Rinsing them under your faucet could cause them to become water-logged and soggy once cooked. Lightly dampen a cloth or paper towel and wipe the mushroom caps gently to remove any dirt from the surface.If your mushrooms appear significantly dirty, you may have no choice but to rinse them very quickly under the tap. Baby bellas, for instance, are often quite dirty. After rinsing, wipe them off immediately with a paper towel.;
, Technically you can eat the stems, but they are tough and woody. If you’re preparing stuffed portobello mushrooms, you have to remove the stems no matter what.Use a knife to slice the stems off, or just pop them off with your fingers and toss them in the trash.If you want to eat the stems anyway, definitely chop them up first since they’re so tough.
You can also use the stems to flavor a homemade stock. They are perishable so you’ll need to use them quickly.

, The black gills are also edible, but they’ll turn whatever dish you’re cooking dark and slimy, so it’s best to discard them. Using the tip of a spoon, gently pry the gills out in small chunks. You can just scoop them out with the spoon, but this gets messy. Their dark color will stain the mushroom caps and your fingers.Removing the gills also gives you a nice clean “bowl” if you’re making stuffed mushrooms., If your recipe calls for whole caps rather than chopped, use a butter knife to score the top before you cook them. This tiny opening will act as a vent and allow steam to escape, allowing the caps to cook faster and more evenly.Scoring the caps will also prevent them from shrinking up and, if you’re marinating, allow the flavors to more deeply penetrate.

Keep them in their original packaging until you’re ready to use them.,
Store loose mushrooms in a partially open ziplock bag.,
Keep them as dry as possible.",How to Clean Portobello Mushrooms2," The high moisture content of mushrooms makes them extremely perishable. Once removed from their packaging, they will quickly shrivel and get slimy unless they’re used immediately. Their original packaging is created to allow them to breathe and release their gases while retaining their moisture.If you don’t use all of them and still have mushrooms left in the container, simply wrap them back up in the original packaging.

, Not all mushrooms come prepackaged; you may have gotten yours loose from the produce department. If so, place them into ziplock baggies when you get them home. Don’t seal the bags up all the way – leave them partially unsealed so the mushroom gases can escape. This will also help them retain moisture.Avoid putting mushrooms in paper bags. This can make them wrinkled and spongy.

, Once mushrooms start soaking up additional moisture, they will deteriorate quickly. Store them in a dry area. If your kitchen is extremely humid, consider sticking them in the fridge. Avoid covering mushrooms with damp paper towels. This is an outdated technique that will actually speed up their deterioration."

Peel off the shell and legs.,
Devein the prawn.,
Choose uncooked prawns with the shell still on.,
Purchase prawns on ice.,
Look at the color.,
Notice the smell.",How to Clean Prawns," If your prawns were frozen, you’ll need to defrost them. Empty the prawns into a large bowl, preferably glass. Pour in some cold water and stir it around. Then drain the prawns and repeat this step several times. The entire process should take about fifteen minutes to fully defrost your prawns.Using the microwave to defrost prawns can make them soggy or overcooked.;
, Put the prawns in a colander and rinse them in the sink with cold water. Use your hands to rinse each prawn individually. As you are rinsing, keep an eye out for any spoiled prawns that are discolored or slimy. Prawns should appear white or gray before cooking.Never use water that is warmer than room temperature, as this could lead to soggy or rubbery prawns.

, Prawns should ideally be cooked immediately after cleaning. However, if you must store them for later, be sure to keep them in the refrigerator for no more than 24 hours. After this length of time, they may start to go bad.


For the freshest, best tasting prawns, consider cleaning and cooking them as soon as you get home from the store.

, Prawns need to be stored in a cool place like the refrigerator. They should be stored at a temperature between 32 °F (0 °C) and 38 °F (3 °C). Keep them together on a tray covered with plastic wrap or in a plastic container while they are in the fridge.You can also freeze prawns for up to three months in your freezer at −18 °C (0 °F), but this may lead to less fresh tasting prawns.
Prawns should never be left out at room temperature for more than a few minutes.

, Hold the prawn by the body with one hand and use your other hand to firmly grasp the prawn’s head. Place the fingers from both hands at the intersection of the head and the body, where you want the break to occur. Pull back with both hands and twist until the head detaches.Discard the unused prawn heads in the trash immediately.

, Hold the prawn by the body and grab the prawn tail with your other hand. Using a firm grip, pull the prawn tail off where it connects with the meaty part of the body. Throw away the tail once you remove it.Removing the tail before the rest of the shell will make the deshelling process much easier.

, Once you have removed the shell, you should be able to peel off the remainder of the prawn’s outer layer quite easily. Use your fingers to pull the legs off from its underside. Then peel back any remaining pieces of the shell.This should leave you with just the meaty part of prawn left.

, Use a sharp knife to cut a small line that runs down the length of the prawn’s back. This should be done on the top of the prawn, the opposite side from where the legs were. Inside, you will see a small black line. Use the tip of the knife to pull out the vein and discard it.This black vein is the prawn’s intestines. Removing it will help your prawns taste much better.
After deveining the prawns, you should rinse them once more with cold water. This will help ensure all remnants of the intestines are completely removed.

, It may seem more convenient to choose prawns that have already been cooked or deshelled, but this will yield a great sacrifice in taste. Prawns taste best after the first time they are cooked, so it is important to purchase raw prawns.Removing the shell gets rid of all the oils on the prawn, so choose prawns that have not been deshelled to help maintain the full flavor.

, Prawns should be purchased fresh and stored on a bed of ice in the meat section of your market or grocery store. This allows you to inspect them for discoloration and smell, and you will be able to choose the best ones.Buying prepackaged prawns means you will get prawns that are much older and will not taste nearly as good.

, Prawns should be white or grayish in color with only white meat. Inspect each prawn for spots or areas of discoloration that indicate spoilage. Only choose prawns that are light in color and have no darker spots on them.There are also brown varieties of prawns that should appear brown in color. These, too, should have no spots or discolored areas.

, While all seafood smells slightly fishy, prawns should not be too odorous. If there is a strong fishy smell to them, that means they are probably going bad. Choose prawns that smell fresh and clean, with only a hint of that seafood smell.This is another reason you should only purchase fresh prawns instead of prepackaged ones. If they are wrapped up in packing, you won’t be able to check out how the prawns smell before you purchase them.

Start your own business. Do yard work, wash cars, walk dogs, do chores or babysit for family members and neighbors regularly. Take a babysitting course with the American Red Cross to be more marketable and earn more money. Get a part-time job. Work evenings and weekends. Many positions like customer service, waiting or bussing tables, delivering newspapers, cashiering or stocking are great starting positions while you are still in school.
Try out for roles in commercials, movies, theater, radio, and TV. Actors and performers are often paid well and can make royalties.
The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) states that you have to be at least 14 to do most non-agricultural jobs. State child labor laws also apply. While this age limitation may not include some jobs, such as delivering newspapers, acting, babysitting, working at a family business or chores around a private home, you will want to verify federal and state laws before taking on work for pay. ;
, Saving early will help you avoid loans. Plan ahead to estimate associated college costs and what you can earn now.


Start a college savings plan as soon as you are able to earn your own money. Begin contributing to a 529 plan when you can put aside at least $25 for it every month. That money can be invested and used to pay for college. Learn more about 529 plans by reading this article.
Look into payment plans your state has available. Some states allow you to pre-pay college at the current tuition rates, which will protect you from cost increases when you are ready to enroll.
Use whatever money you have saved. Pay your tuition with everything you have in your savings accounts, piggy bank, and investments.

, Now’s the time to network and garner favor. Some of your connections might be willing to help you pay for college. Investing in higher education could be an attractive idea for people who have the means.


Make sure potential benefactors know about qualified transfers. This allows them to pay tuition directly to a qualified college for you without being subject to the gift tax. You should both consult a tax advisor before going through with the transfer. , At only $80 for 3 credits, this can cut out a great deal of money - and save you tons of time!

, School tuition and fees are important factors to consider when choosing potential colleges or career schools. The cost of your school should be reasonable compared to your future career’s earning potential. Research colleges and apply to the ones with the lowest tuition costs and fees after financial aid.Check out your local community college. Many community colleges are inexpensive options as you can live at home and take classes. You can transfer to another school to pursue further education after you have completed a few years at the community college level or once you have fulfilled all your general education requirements.
Most schools provide information on attendance costs and offer a net price calculator on their websites. This calculator will give you an idea about program costs minus any financial aid.

, While you are in college, many family members will allow you to live with them for free. This will remove most living expenses so that you can use the majority of the money you earn on your tuition.

, If you cannot live with someone, sharing the cost of housing is an excellent way to save money that you can use to pay for college. You can also split living costs, such as food and utilities. To save even more, opt for several roommates.

, Purchasing a car can be an expensive investment that requires payments, insurance, maintenance, and gas. Using other methods to run errands and go to school could save you hundreds of dollars a month that can help pay for school.

, Most qualifying students who attend participating colleges receive some kind of financial aid. It is even possible to get a “free ride” through college with all costs covered. Talk to your college financial aid department to discuss your options.


You will need to fill out the Federal Application For Student Aid (FAFSA) and other application materials.
Grants such as the Pell Grant do not have to be paid back. The amount awarded will depend on your financial need and the cost of your school. Along with federal grants, states and schools often offer their own grants as well.

, Most scholarships are based on merit, and you can earn one by meeting certain standards. This can mean academic achievement, being part of a particular group, or having a special talent, trait, or interest. Some scholarships might also be based on financial need. Whether you are a great athlete, a volunteer in the community, or a star student with stellar grades, there is probably a scholarship available. The U.S. Department of Labor offers a free scholarship search tool here.
Use another Internet service to help you locate scholarships you might qualify for. Try sites such as FastWeb, Petersons, and The College Board. These are free sites that take your information and notify you when a scholarship is announced that you are eligible for.
Check with your college on scholarships that are available to incoming students as well as other scholarships for students that you may qualify for.
Look for local scholarships. Many civic organizations such as The Kiwanis Club, The Junior League, and religious organizations often offer scholarships. You may also qualify for scholarships with nonprofit or private organizations in your city or state.
Each scholarship will have its own requirements. The scholarship website should provide more information on how to qualify and apply. Make sure you read application materials carefully and meet application deadlines. Be aware of scams. Make sure scholarship offers are legitimate. You don't have to pay to find scholarships or financial aid., Examples include the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) Scholarships or a Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) grant. This grant is available for those who are taking classes to begin a teaching career. Many other public service-based grants and scholarships are available, so check with your school., Many students go to college part-time so they can work full-time jobs to pay for college. You could also go to school full-time and work part-time to finish school more quickly and have some extra money for tuition.


Look for work-study opportunities at your college. This is often a big part of many students' financial aid plans. Some colleges may also offer programs that allow you to work in exchange for tuition waivers. Ask your financial aid department for details.

, If you work full-time, your employer might pay for your college classes. Check with human resources about the availability of this benefit. You parent’s employer may also offer tuition assistance to family members.

, The federal government helps veterans pay for college with the GI Bill. While in the military, you can often get tuition waivers as well. Alternately, you might consider joining the AmeriCorps.


Investigate all of the programs offered by the Department of Veteran's Affairs. The amount of benefits you receive will depend on your length of service and what type of education you plan to pursue.
AmeriCorps programs provide pathways to opportunity for young people entering the workforce. You will enter into service positions to learn valuable skills and earn money for education. "

Help them build a strong foundation.,
Encourage them to gain as much experience as possible.,
Help them to create a portfolio that will appear balanced as well as professional.,
Without being too condescending, make sure that this is the option that your student really wants to take.,
Support your student as they wait for news.",How to Prepare Arts Students for College," Make sure they have a solid knowledge of the foundation skills that make up their art-based course.


With every subject, there is going to be plenty of work to do to make sure they have the transferrable skills for their course.
For example in a classical music course, your student is going to need to have a high motivation level, strong sight-reading capability and the ability to absorb criticism, using it to work on their technique etc, without becoming too offended (particularly in vocal studies).
Making sure that they get the right amount of practice time - with classical ballet dancing and with classical instrument training (also for pop and jazz) 4 - 6 hours daily is recommended (except for voice, when it is recommended young singers stick to around 1 - 2 hours a day, spaced in half an hour slots).;
, This should happen both in person and through listening/watching to others experiences.


An arts-based student should have plenty of their own experience to learn from and to use when working in further projects. For example, knowing how to present themselves in an audition situation, both formal and informal.
Arts-based courses are also largely based on experience - when applying to the colleges, admission boards will want to see what students have to offer, using specific experiences to show contrast and versatility in behaviour.
Experience can be gained by being part of a company or an orchestra (there are plenty of these available in most areas, for free or for charge).
But experience is also gained largely by observing the experiences of others. Namely seeing professional dancers working first hand (open dress rehearsals are fantastic for this) or listening to as much music as possible (so that you have a diverse range to draw from when analysing).
This goes for art directly - being able to draw from paintings of a large portion of history to mark how change has occurred, or in literature how writing has evolved through the separate genres.

, Despite the student having a clear passion for the art-based subject they are applying for, the application provided should be one which appears balanced to the critical reader.


Some art-based courses,if vocational like a music conservatoire, will not focus too largely on the grades or personal statement written - they will look more closely at experience.
However, if an art-based institution is providing an academic course (e.g. academic music) then there will need to be a clear balance between grades, skill and experience - but it's highly recommended that you use this latter option for where ever you are applying as it means you will have less to edit for all of your applications and also means that you don't lose track of what you have sent to whom - it appears more professional in its strength of organisation/structure also.
Encourage your student to succeed in this by working hard. Hard work means secure grades alongside secure skills which never fails to appear neat and successful. This will be the most attractive portfolio option you can provide to the admissions board as a result.

, No matter how gifted the student in their field, the shift from high school to college is a big one and will be one that needs a lot of time to adjust to due to the that difference.


Make sure your student is happy that they are choosing the college right for them. Don't present your question in a condescending manner, just be subtle and informative about the options they will be able to take after completing an arts degree, as the options are often much more limited than with a further academic degree.
Perhaps refer your student, or suggest they see, to the school careers team, who will be able to provide the student with a more detailed outlook on the entire situation - whether it be providing them with a prospectus about the university or a contact number so they can find out more directly.
Make sure that you are not selfish in your opinions - be patient and kind. This decision will be one which your student is thinking a lot about and is entirely about them. As their teacher/parent, it is your place to support, encourage and help. Of course inform them of any worries, but do not tell them to do anything specifically based on this if it is about only your judgement and not theirs.
The aim is for you to be unbiased when aiding your student in this application and preparation process.

, After the application has been put through, the hard work sustained and the outcomes weighed, it will be largely about waiting to hear back from the university/college.


Be there for your student/child at this time by being quietly supportive. Enquire when possible and offer any further help that you believe would be useful to helping them achieve their success (e.g. further classes)
If you stay calm, it will be easier for them to stay calm so do not be afraid to set this example.
On an ending note - do not be too disheartened for your student if answers do not come back immediately. Remind your student of this also - there are hundreds of applicants to every course, so it is important to keep the focus on work and experience, allowing universities to take their time with the reply. The more distracted the student from the length of time, the less they will think about it and hence their stress levels should hopefully be kept down.
Hopefully, you should hear back fairly soon and the news will be positive! But until then, as stated, make sure the applicant continues to work hard at their studies.

Follow your interests.,
Think about what makes you happy.,
Pay attention to what inspires enthusiasm.,
See if your college offers any assessment tools.",How to Pick a College Major1," Try to think about things that interest you as a person. Chances are, there is at least one major centered around a particular interest of yours. When it comes to selecting a major, start by evaluating your own interests.Think about how you took to high school. Were there any subjects you really looked forward to? For example, maybe you loved your history, philosophy, and political science courses. A political science degree could be great for you.
You don't just have to think scholastically either. Pay attention to what you're interested in outside the classroom. For example, maybe you always loved animals and volunteered at your local animal shelter all through high school. A degree like Zoology may benefit you.;
, When it comes to passion, happiness is key. If you want to pick a major you feel passionate about, evaluate when and where you feel the happiest. Try to pick a major that you think will bring you happiness.Make a list of things that make you happy. If you see items on that list that include things like reading, writing, and watching movies, a degree in something like English or film studies may benefit you.
You should also look into research regarding the happiest majors. Some studies indicate those in STEM fields, which stands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, tend to be the happiest after graduation.

, If you want a major you're passionate about, think about when you feel enthusiastic. Think about the classes you were fully engaged in during high school. Think about what activities excite you. Enthusiasm is very linked to a sense of passion.Maybe certain courses always demanded your full attention. You may have gotten a thrill out of solving difficult equations in math or chemistry classes. You may love studying something like mathematics or chemistry.
Think about what you're enthusiastic about outside the classroom. If you love watching historical documentaries and reading books about history, you may love being a history major.

, If you have a wide range of interests and passions, it can be tough to nail down one major. Talk to your college's career counseling center and see if they often any assessment tools. Many schools have questionnaires you can fill out that will help direct you to relevant areas of study for you.You can also make an appointment with a career counselor at your school. They can help you pinpoint a major that's relevant to your personal interests and passions.

Recognize your natural abilities.,
Identify your dream job.,
Look into the financial payoff of certain majors.,
Weigh in whether you're on a very specific career path.,
Be aware of prerequisites.",How to Pick a College Major2," If you're taking the practical route, assess what you're good at. If you have particular skills already, it may be wise to build upon them in college. Think about what your strengths and weaknesses were in high school. This can help you identify areas where you're likely to excel.For example, maybe you got high scores and standardizes tests for areas like math and science. A degree in a STEM field may benefit you. You already know you're adept at the kind of thinking required for such a degree.
Maybe you never took to math and science, but did very well on fields like writing and reading comprehension. You may do better in a field based in the humanities.

, Where do you see yourself after college? If you could have any job in the world, what would it be? Answering these questions can help you identify a major that will help you on your career path.Some career paths give you very specific guidance in terms of the degree you should pursue. If you want to, say, be a teacher, you will need a teaching degree. If you plan to become a doctor or a lawyer, you'll need a pre-law or pre-med degree.
Other paths are less obvious. If you want to, say, work for a grassroots political organization, there are a variety of degrees that may help. Something like political science, history, journalism, or communications may pay off. You could also go for a degree related to the organization's interests. For example, if you want to work for somewhere like Greenpeace, opt for a degree related to the environment.
Meeting with a career counselor can help you plan a degree path related to your chosen career.

, If you want to make a decent living after graduation, look into the ultimate pay off. This may be particularly important if you're taking on a lot of debt to get your degree. Think about which degrees tend to pay the highest.Things like business, architecture, engineering, computer, math, and science degrees tend to pay the highest.
Degrees in areas like health, social sciences, and public law tend to offer midrange pay.
Degrees in the humanities and areas like communications and journalism tend to pay lower.

, If you're already on a specific career path, your major may already be somewhat decided for you. If you plan on going straight to medical school, for example, there may be a very specific pre-med track you need to follow. Try talking to a career advisor at your school to make sure you've selected the right major for your chosen career.When you're asking, make sure to address your specific concerns. For example, say something like, ""I plan to go to medical school after graduation. Is there a specific major I should declare to make sure I get into a good college?""

, Some majors require specific courses to have been completing prior to signing up for the major. Some major you can simply declares, while others have an admissions process. Prior to selecting a major, review the prerequisites. Make sure you're able to fulfill any prerequisites before getting your heart set on a major.Talking to a relevant college advisor can help you make sure you get the prerequisites down. You may have to spend your freshmen year taking certain classes in preparation for declaring a certain major. Ask questions like, ""If I want to study music, is there an auditions process?""

"
"
Look into minors and double majors.,
Avoid a highly specialized major.,
Explore some courses before selecting a major.,
Remember you can always change your major.,
Seek advice from others.",How to Pick a College Major3," If your passions are very wide-reaching, you can see if a double major is an option. You may be able to choose more than one major so you're able to study everything that interests you personally. You also may be able to declare one or two minors, allowing you to explore multiple interests.Remember, a double major may require a great deal of extra work. Before declaring a double major, make sure that you're able to commit to the demands required.

, You may want to choose a major that closely reflects your future job description. However, keep in mind tastes and passions change over time. While your dream job now may be to work for a grassroots environmental organization, majoring in something too specific to that field limits your options upon graduation. This can make your job search more difficult if you start looking into different careers.It's particularly important to keep your major open if you're not sure about your future career at all. You could, for example, look into majoring in a general field like biology or psychology. This gives you the opportunity to pursue a variety of careers, or graduate programs, upon graduation.

, There's no need to select a major immediately your freshmen year if you're truly unsure. Instead of immediately selecting a major, give yourself a couple of semesters to explore your options. Get your general education requirements out of the way while taking a few classes that interest you. This can help you figure out what you want to study more specifically in the future., Nothing is set in stone, especially early on in college. Many students change their majors at least once during the course of their college career. If you're stressed out about picking a major, don't be. You can always switch majors sometime sophomore year if you dislike the path you chose., You can always ask around if you're not sure. In addition to college advisers, talk to people you trust who've gone through the college experience. Friends, family members, and professors can all help guide you.


If you have parents and older siblings who completed college, ask them how they chose their major. They may be able to offer you some guidance.
If you know other students in a major you're interested in, ask them about it. For example, ""Hey, you're an English major? Can we get coffee some time and you can tell me about your major. I'm thinking of studying English as well.""
You can also ask a professor. If your goal is to, say, teach biology at the university level, ask your biology teacher about what they majored in during college.

, Having clear and detailed notes will help you tremendously while studying.

, Unless of course you have a photographic memory and remember everything right when you write it down. But I doubt it...

, The only way you will remember all the information is when you make the appropriate connections in your brain. That can only happen if you are absolutely clear about the material your professor is covering. (Or at least the material that will be on the exam.) So don't hesitate just ask. Others will learn from your questions as well.

, Just because you are a friendly person doesn't mean you will get an A but knowing your professor helps. As much as some of them don't show it...they care! Get to know the way your professor thinks and show them that you care about the class as well. If you have questions or want to review your professor's office is the best place to go.

, Even if you're a genius, this step will be necessary. Find your learning style and use appliances such as flash cards, study guides, review sessions and intelligent friends.

, It doesn't mean you have to give up your social life or sports. It just means that you have to learn how to manage your time successfully.

Go to parties with your friends.,
Get creative when dressing for theme parties.,

Make new friends.",How to Have Fun in College1," Take advantage of the parties that college life is known for, and find the ones that are best suited to your social interests. If you enjoy large parties, try going to sororities, fraternities, or other large gatherings. Small parties, or a group of people gathering in a friend’s apartment, can also be fun.Always go with a friend or a group of friends to larger parties. It will be safer and more fun.
It’s a good idea to leave the party before it ends. Once people start to leave the party, most of the fun is finished.
Be mindful of the amount of alcohol you consume at a party, and be careful not to drink a drink you didn’t pour yourself.;
, Themes can be just about anything from 1980’s parties, Hippie parties (or “Hippie vs. Hipster”), Mardi Gras parties, “Luck O’the Irish” parties, etc. You can usually find the clothes you need in thrift stores.Avoid racially-charged or sensitive subjects when planning your theme party, or your outfit for a theme party. This can go very wrong, very quickly. Ask yourself whether you’re making fun of a particular cultural group, or if it might be misinterpreted in this way.Wear something versatile, so you’re not stuck in the theme all night if you decide to go elsewhere. For example, if you’re going to an 80’s dance party, think about wearing a brightly colored shirt, black tights, and Converse hightops, over a strappy black dress. That way, you can just take off the shirt and change shoes when you’re ready to move on.

, Get your friends to pool their resources, and rent a van or RV for a week-long road trip to your favorite destination. You might find yourself staying with friends, relatives, or camping out to save money.As a student, you’re eligible for discounts on some rentals, hotel rooms, and other destinations.
Take back roads whenever you can to really explore the landscape you’re traveling through.
Post pictures of your road trip on social media with your friends and family back home.

, Just being around so many other people your age is one of the best parts of college life. You’ll make friends in college that will last a lifetime. Just put yourself in situations where you’ll be most likely to meet other students who share your interests and values. If it’s hard for you to make friends, start by looking around at the other students in your classes.Remember that most people are shy sometimes, and that it’s not always easy to initiate a conversation with a new person.
If you live in a dorm or residence hall, try to get to know others on your floor. If there are mixers or social events to help with this, you should attend them.
It’s okay to start a conversation, no matter how random, with anyone who looks like another student. This is the norm for college social life, so take advantage of it!

Do not post to the internet or in any other forum.",How to Get the Most of Recording College Lectures," You may want to record a lecture for a variety of reasons, such as illness or complicated subject matter. However, recording has its disadvantages as well as advantages. Take these into consideration.


If the course subject matter is complex and difficult, it may help to listen to a lecture two or three times to help you understand it, especially when you’re reviewing for an exam.If you know you’re going to miss a class lecture and don’t trust another student’s notes, you can record a lecture to make sure you don’t miss any important material.If you can’t keep up with how quickly your professor speaks, you may consider recording a lecture. It’s important to make sure in this case, however, that it’s not because you feel the need to copy down everything she is saying instead of what is important.
Recording a lecture can be distracting to other students and the professor, as well as to you. Students have complained that worrying about things such as battery strength takes away from their experience of the live lecture.
Recording the lecture may even encourage you to participate in class less actively. You may choose to pay less attention or take less complete notes if you think you can “get back to it” later.;
, Before you even consider purchasing a device and taking it to class to record a lecture, get the professor’s approval. Not only do many professors have policies on recording their lectures, which can be a form of intellectual property, but universities are also increasingly enacting regulations on taping classes.


If you have a legitimate reason why you want to record the lecture, such as an absence, a disability, or difficulty writing, talk to your professor. You may want to get a doctor’s excuse or disability accommodation for these cases. Your college or university will likely have an office of disability services that can help you arrange an accommodation with your professors.
Make sure to check the university’s policies as well. Because so many schools are moving to online classes, many now have regulations on recording lectures.

, After you’ve received the approval of your professor or university, research and buy the best device for your particular needs. You’ll want to consider several factors from recording capacity to device size.


Check for a recording sensitivity that is strong enough to pick up speakers who use different tones and who may be standing at a distance. Since classrooms often have a lot of background noise, you’ll also want a device that has a background cancellation feature to reduce peripheral noise.Find a recording device that can store at least one full class lecture and has memory expansion capabilities. If you have a simple battery-operated tape recorder, you can always carry extra tapes. But for more sophisticated technology, you’ll need to be able to add more memory once you fill it.Most devices will come with USB ports that you can use to upload lectures to your computer.
Many laptops have built in microphones and you can also use these to record lectures, although they may not record as effectively as purpose-built voice recorders.
Get a small, unobtrusive device that you can easily carry. Not only will this save your shoulders or arms from extra weight, but will also not distract you, your classmates, or the professor.You can buy recording devices online or in-stores. Most major retailers and specialty electronics stores have a variety of recording devices for sale.

, Before you take your device to record a lecture, it’s a good idea to do a test run with it to make sure you know how to operate it properly. This will also help ensure that you don’t have any disasters the day of a lecture.


You can use the test run to figure out how close you need to be to a speaker to pick up her voice. You can easily do this by testing your own voice at different distances.
Consider adding some background noise to your test run to see how this affects the quality of the recording and make adjustments as necessary.

, If you are aware of common recording problems, then you can avoid any disasters during the recording or when you play it back. This will help ensure that you also get the most from recording your college lecture.


Make sure you have enough memory and battery power to record the entire lecture.Videotape the lecture if you’re allowed. It will allow you to record power point presentations if the professor uses them.Make sure your device doesn’t make any loud noises or create any visual signals that will distract you, your classmates, or the professor.

, Before you go to a lecture, check to make sure that you have not only enough storage space on your recording device, but also that it has enough battery power. This will ensure that you capture the entire class and don’t miss anything.If you have a battery-operated device, make sure it is charged or that you have spare batteries.
If you are using a tape recorder, take an extra tape or two with you in case you run out of space or experience technical difficulties.

, In order to get the most optimal recording of a lecture, sit close to where the professor is standing. This will ensure that you directly hear her voice, but also that there isn’t as much background noise.


If the professor moves around the classroom, it may not be as easy to capture her voice. Try sitting near the front at one of the sides to make sure that there aren’t too many other people around you to dampen the professor’s voice.
Don’t sit at the back of a classroom because you may not be able to record the lecture clearly.Make sure that you are not moving around too much so that your movements don’t disrupt the sound recording.

, Taping a lecture is not an invitation to zone out during class. It’s important that you also take notes on a lecture. Not only will writing notes help you remember the subject matter more effectively, but there are also notes the professor wrote on a board or in a slide presentation that a recording might not capture.


Studies have shown that students who take handwritten notes actually learn and retain more.Use the recording only to clarify what you don’t understand or didn’t catch in class.

, If you want to be able to listen to your recorded lecture for notes or to help you understand a topic, remember to save it at the end of class. This will be a good backup and help clarify your written notes if need be.


If you accidentally forgot to save the recording of your lecture, you can ask a friend if he has one.
Many recording programs and devices will automatically save a recording as it progresses.

, After you’ve attended and recorded a lecture, make sure to listen to the recording within a day of hearing it. This will ensure that it is fresh in your mind if there are parts that you need to clarify.


The longer you wait to listen to a recording, the less able you will be to clarify parts that are not clear or missing. Listening to it immediately will also help you identify any other issues with the recording.

, Listening to your recording and converting it to text, also called transcribing, is another benefit of recording a lecture. You can use this text to back up your class notes, clarify any points you don’t understand, or even to save tape or memory space on your device.


Combining your class notes with the transcription of your lecture recording can be an incredibly effective study tool.
Transcribing will also help clarify any areas of the recording that may not be clear.
Transcribing the lecture into text also allows you to search the text, which is something you cannot do with the sound recording.

, Having a collection of lectures from a class can be a very effective study tool during exams. Not only can the recording help you understand difficult topics, but it will fill in for any classes that you may have missed. Recorded lectures are almost as good for transferring knowledge as live lectures, particularly if you can supplement them with your memory and class notes.


You can either use the sound recording or a transcribed text of it to study.
Listening to the lectures again over the course of the semester may help you retain the material more effectively. Studies have shown that listening to the same lecture more than once can help you determine what information is most important.Make sure to have your class notes in front of you. These can help you better understand the recording. Studies have also shown that recorded are more effective when combined with more “active” forms of learning, such as creating or organizing class notes.
Transcribing the lecture recording will also let you delete it, saving memory or tapes.

, In the event that your friends miss a lecture or are also confused by the class material, you can lend them your recordings. In some cases, listening to the lectures together can be useful as you try to work through the course material.


Make sure to get back any recording you lend out so that you can use it. You can also wait to let someone borrow the lecture until you’ve transcribed it.
Letting friends use the recordings can benefit you. If you have to miss a class and need someone to record the lecture for you, you can offer to record a lecture for them if they miss class. Listening to a lecture together may also help you clarify any material you and your friend don’t understand.

, Because universities increasingly have regulations on recording lectures and course material may fall under intellectual property laws, never post your recorded lecture on the internet or in any other forum. If you want to use a portion of the recording, ask the professor if you may use it.


If you do ask to use the recording, specify to the professor how and why you plan to use it.

, You're going to need to work very hard to get admitted to Oxford, not to mention once you start your university studies. Learn to love studying and to thrive under a rigorous study schedule., Genuine enthusiasm and curiosity can get you very far in the admissions process.Go beyond the standard curriculum. For the ideal Oxford candidate, things learned in school and for standardized tests are still fairly limited in scope.Broaden your knowledge as much as possible.
If you have the financial resources, take extra classes at a local community college, summer school, or tutoring center.
If you can't afford to pay for additional courses, teach yourself more about your subject by reading as much about it as you can get your hands on. Go to a nearby university library and check their collection of books, do Internet searches on your subject, etc.

, As rigid as this may seem, it's important. Oxford has extremely high standards when it comes to grades, so they need to be perfect.

, It's a myth that you must be incredible well-rounded to be accepted into Oxford. While some Oxford students have lots of extracurricular interests, others may be solely focused on their passion for study.This doesn't mean you should give up an activity you really love and bury yourself in books all day, every day. Passions and talents are always attractive in candidates–and besides, they make your life more enjoyable.

, At Oxford, students belong to a department or faculty as well as a college or hall. The university is comprised of over 30 colleges, which function as academic communities where students have small-group study sessions called tutorials. (Lectures, testing, grading, etc. is organized by the department.) Each college also has its own dining hall, common room and library, plus groups and societies.


Find out which colleges accept applications for your course of study by visiting the course page of the university website.
Browse information about the colleges on the website. You'll find they differ in terms of accommodation, location, funding opportunities, and whether they are for graduates and undergraduates alike.Your application is judged by the department, not the college, so your candidacy will not be affected by your choice of college. You might also be reallocated to a college different from the one you applied to.
You also have the option of making an ""open application"" by entering the specified code on your application (see application instructions for more details). In this case, the university will assign you to a college or hall., The fastest way to do this is by visiting the course page of the website, as well as the general undergraduate admissions information page. Admissions requirements include certain scores on standardized tests, coursework in high school, and examples of written work.


You'll also need to write a personal statement about the subject you've chosen to study, and a reference from a teacher or advisor., The application process takes place online only.


Students with a science degree who are applying for the Accelerate Medicine course have a separate application form.Check about application deadlines well in advance. You need to plan ahead to make sure you have all requirements complete on time.

, Accepted standardized tests include IELTS, TOEFL, CAE, CPE, the English Language GCSE, International Baccalaureate Standard Level in English, and the European Baccalaureate., If the department you've applied to thinks your application is strong enough, they'll shortlist you. In that case, you need to attend an interview. However, sometimes applicants receive notice that they've been shortlisted just a few days before the interview is scheduled. In that case, you should be ready to go.


Check the interview timetable on the university website for dates when they're holding interviews.
The interview schedule is very tight, and rescheduling is generally not possible.Keep in mind that accommodation and meals are free of charge when you come for your interview.
If you have a disability, let the university know as soon as possible so they can accommodate you during the interview scheduling and process.
International students living far from the UK may be able to schedule an interview over the phone or Internet. The exception is applicants for Medicine, who must come to Oxford., You'll receive a letter from the college if you've been selected to come to an interview. As mentioned above, it might be very short notice, up to a week in advance., During the interview you'll be asked questions whose aim is not for you to regurgitate what you already know, but rather to apply the knowledge you have to solve new tasks. The interview tutor wants to hear you think aloud, so practice this in advance with a friend or teacher, with them asking you questions and you talking through your response.


An applicant to psychology might be asked why studies have shown that Welsh speakers have more difficulty memorizing phone numbers than English speakers. Hopefully, the interviewee would be able to make the connection that memory and arithmetic depend on how easily pronounced the words are (Welsh numbers are longer than English ones).
A would-be art history student might be asked to discuss a painting that they've never seen before.In this case they could apply their analytical skills, refer to relevant influences or movements, etc.
Remember, the best preparation you can have is a broad knowledge of your area of focus.

, The university's website features clips of mock interviews. This is a great opportunity to get a sense of the interview format.


You can also find sample questions on the Interview section of the university's website.

, The tutors who interview you tend to be casually dressed, and formal dress on your part is not at all required.

, The tutor will try to put you at ease by asking you some simple questions to start off with, such as about your personal statement. Be sure you reread your statement and any other written work you've submitted with your application so you're ready to talk about it.Your letter of invitation will specify any documents you need to bring along, but it's a good idea to bring a copy of your personal statement.

Considering factors such as types of classes you took, extracurricular activities, and other extenuating circumstances may help point you in the direction of the right college or university for you.


Make a list of everything you have to offer, both positive and negative. For example, you may have bad grades but are taking challenging college preparatory classes instead of regular level courses or have very high SAT scores.Likewise, maybe you participate in activities and your local community, which may help offset your bad grades.Note if you have a mix of bad and better grades. For example, maybe you have a D in chemistry, but a B in ceramics. This can indicate to potential schools that you are better at certain subjects, especially if they are related to your suggested major.
Be honest with yourself about what you have to offer. If you’re not sure, speak to your school counselor, a parent, or friends.;
, Make a list of colleges and universities that interest you. Keep your expectations realistic so that it’s easier for you to narrow down and apply to an institution that may accept you.Keep in mind your assets when formulating your list, but also that you have bad grades. This can help keep your choices within the realm of realistic options.
Maintain your perspective when selecting schools. For example, Ivy League institutions aren’t likely to accept a student with bad grades, even if you are an athlete. However, state institutions and community colleges, and many smaller private colleges may be more flexible.<refhttp:
Compile a list of top choices, potential institutions and “safety schools” to which you may be more likely to receive an acceptance letter. For example, you could list your top choice as the University of Wisconsin, your second level choice as Colorado State and your “safety school” as Indian River Community College.

, From your list of potential colleges and universities, conduct research on each institution. This can help you put together a final list of schools you may want to contact, visit, and apply.Check the web pages of your potential colleges. Most will offer admissions statistics and describe special programs they may have for students who need help.
Ask you school counselor if she has any information about the institution.
Speak to someone from the college or a person who is attending or has graduated from the school.
Read publications such as magazines about college rankings that offer statistics

, Beyond your list of potential colleges or universities, explore additional institutions. This may give you a longer list of schools that not only interest you, but also that may accept your special circumstances.


You can search online for colleges with lower admission standards, including grades.
Check satellite campuses of universities. These may not have the same requirements as your top choice schools. For example, if your grades may keep you out of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, look into the program at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater.Speak to school counselors or teachers. They may have some ideas of additional institutions that may interest you.Visit a local college fair, which will give you the opportunity to learn more about a specific school and ask a representative any questions you may have.

, If you are able, make campus visits to any colleges or universities that interest you. This can give you a better sense of the institution and if it is a possibility for you. It will also give you the chance to speak with admissions counselors or ask questions about the school or application process.Schedule a campus visit at a time convenient for you by calling a admissions representative. She can set up a campus tour and meetings with students or professors.
Attend a potential students’ weekend to give you an idea of as many aspects of what the university has to offer as possible.
Take a virtual tour. Many schools now offer virtual tours for students who can’t visit in person and may also have admissions counselors with whom you can chat online with potential questions.

, Consider speaking to an admissions counselor at the universities that really interest you. She can answer questions you have or give you tips about how to best apply with your bad grades.


Be absolutely honest with the counselor. This can demonstrate maturity and that you are willing to take responsibility for your situation.Show as much interest as you can in the school to the admissions counselor by asking a lot of questions and demonstrating that you’ve researched the programs. This may help offset the bad grades and help her make a case for your admission.

, After you’ve had a chance to explore the thousands of colleges and universities you could attend, narrow down the list to places to which you’d like to apply.This can help you create a manageable number of applications to write and may improve your chances of getting in to a university.Keep the number of schools to which you apply within a reasonable limit so that you can focus on writing quality applications. For example, you may want to apply to 5-10 schools instead of 20.
Remember to have a list of different types of institutions such as community colleges, satellite campuses, smaller institutions and your top choice schools.

, For each college to which you plan to apply, compile a list of application requirements. This can help ensure that you don’t forget to enclose any documents or miss the deadline.


List all of the documents you require including essays, the form, and how many recommendation letters you need.
Note the deadline and aim to submit well before that date.

, Most universities offer early admission, which is very competitive. Avoid this option to help improve your grades or standardized testing scores.Some schools work on rolling admissions, meaning that they continue to accept students until the freshmen class is filled. These types of schools may leave you a little more wiggle room in terms of when you can apply.

, You’ll likely need 2-3 recommendation letters from teachers or counselors as a part of your application packet. Ask for your references at least 4 weeks in advance to give the referee plenty of time to compose the letter.


Ask teachers or counselors who know you and your work well, and who can write a strong letter for you. For example, if you have better grades in history than other subjects, ask your history teacher to submit a letter on your behalf.Give your referees any relevant information that can help them compose a strong letter for you. Make sure to let them know the deadline for the letter, too.

, Obtain a copy of the general application form and fill it out. Be as honest as possible with your answers, which may help you gain admission if you can explain them.Write in your standardized test scores and grades. If there is a section where it asks you to explain anything about either, compose a brief answer that demonstrates your awareness of your bad grades and how you are trying to improve them.Explain anything about your grades, scores, or other information that may be relevant. For example, perhaps you got bad grades one year because you were dealing with an illness. This may help make your case to give you a chance at a college.Call an admissions counselor if you have any questions on the application form.

, You may have to submit personal essays about why you want to attend that specific college. Writing about your motivations while acknowledging any potential problems can help strengthen your case and counterbalance bad grades.


Read the question(s) closely and answer it honestly and as to the point as possible.
Include any information about your grades and the reasons why you have them or that you are trying to improve them. This demonstrates maturity and that you are willing to take responsibility for your actions.Consider submitting a short supplemental essay that addresses the issue with your grades.
Stay within the page limits given on the application form.

, Before you submit your application, check over your answers and essays. This can minimize the risk of errors and help make a good impression of you.


Read your essays and answers aloud, which can help you more easily spot mistakes.
Put the application together in the order of required documents, which may minimize the risk of accidentally forgetting to include information.

, When your complete application package is ready, submit it either online or by mail. It may take a few weeks to a few months to receive the college’s decision on your application.


Make sure to submit it before the deadline. Aim to file your application the day before it is due to give yourself some breathing room if you have any problems with it.
Consider sending the application by registered mail to ensure it arrives on time.
Track its progress online if you are able.
Improve your grades and re-apply the following year if you don’t receive an acceptance letter.

Give a blanket made of college T-shirts.,
Create a swag bag of college gear.,
Make a photo collage of college memories.",How to Give a Great College Graduation Gift1," This is a creative gift that the graduate can keep for years to come. Each college, especially large universities, have a wide variety of T-shirts that can be used to create a unique throw blanket.;
, All college and university bookstores carry all kinds of themed gear and memorabilia, including T-shirts, sweatshirts/hoodies, shorts, gym bags, photo frames, and coffee mugs. Collect a few of these items and gift them to the graduate in a themed bag, if possible. Even though they are leaving campus, they can still show their school pride wherever they go.

, After graduation, many graduates will have to say goodbye to friends they’ve made over the years. But this doesn’t mean they have to forget the memories they made together. Photo collages or albums are a great way to help your graduate transition from familiar faces to a new environment.


Simply collect photos and compile them into a photo album. Since many people don’t print pictures anymore, you might have to search through the graduate’s social media pages to find and print pictures.
Print photos and arrange them in a large frame, or a few large frames, so that the graduate can display their memories in their new home or office.
Get creative with a pillow collage. Many photo development centers offer services that allow you to print photos on fabrics, and a pillow collage is sure to be a unique keepsake of college memories."

Go to your school’s club fair.,
Join a club that reflects your interests.,
Try a club that’s outside your experience.,
Start your own club.,
Join a sorority or fraternity.,
Think about joining a club just for fun.,
Don’t join too many clubs.",How to Have Fun in College2," At the start of the semester there’s usually an event where all campus clubs have tables with information about their club. This is a great place to start, when you’re thinking about what club to join. Ask questions, take a look at the material the club is sharing, and think about whether it might be fun to try out.Remember that joining a club doesn’t mean a huge initial commitment. You can always sign up for lots of clubs, then drop out of the ones that aren’t fun for you.
There’s likely to be lots of fun, free stuff at the school’s club fair, like stickers, snacks, and other things.

, Most colleges and universities have student organizations based around certain interests. You might find an anime club, or an astronomy club. Some clubs are for sharing and learning about other cultures, such as Spanish club or Chinese club.Joining a club will allow you to meet other students who share your interests.
Staying active in areas that you’re interested in help you to remain connected to your own passions.

, One of the best things about college is the chance to participate in events and activities that broaden your knowledge of the world. A club that allows you to move outside your comfort zone may turn out to be very fun.For example, if you’re terrified about public speaking, consider joining the drama club.
If you’ve never participated in team sports, think about joining an intramural sports team such as Ultimate Frisbee.

, If there isn’t a club around something that interests you, consider starting one of your own. You’ll have to register your club with the university either online or through a paper document. Once your club is confirmed, you’ll be listed in the university’s directory of clubs, and you’ll have access to campus buildings and equipment.You might start a student club, a campus club (including students and faculty). or a community club (that includes students, faculty and community members).
For example, one student noticed that there were student groups for other cultural minorities, but not for students with disabilities. She started a student group so that students with disabilities could come together and get to know each other.

, Being part of a Greek organization does more than just provide you access to great parties. It also offers a sense of community with your fraternity brothers, or sorority sisters, that will last a lifetime.Choose a Greek that reflects your interests, values, and priorities. For example, Mu Phi Epsilon is a coed international professional fraternity, and Alpha Chi Sigma is a professional chemistry fraternity.
Greeks participate in fundraising for charitable causes.
If you join a Greek organization, you’ll have access to additional scholarships, tutoring and other benefits.

, Sometimes people join student clubs to enhance their resumes later on, but it’s worth thinking about joining a club that’s purely fun. Clubs can provide a much-needed outlet for your creative, artistic, or social interests.For example, you might join a line-dancing club, or a Star Trek club.
Having fun in clubs can help balance out the stresses of the intense studying of college.

, You’ll probably join more clubs at the beginning of the semester than you’ll have time for as the semester continues. You don’t want your club participation to become stressful when it’s meant to be fun.You can also change the number of commitments within the club that you’re responsible for. If you’re participating in more than 1-2 clubs, you might try to keep your commitments to a minimum.
If you find yourself stressed by the amount of club activities you’re expected to do, take a step back. Think about what your priorities are.

Take advantage of cultural events.,
Make sure to check for student discounts.,
Take a semester to study abroad.,
Consider taking independent studies.",How to Have Fun in College3," Research suggests that attendance at cultural events significantly enhances your experience in college. Colleges provide regular opportunities to attend theater productions, go to art shows and literary readings, attend musical performances such as concerts and recitals.Your university may bring in exciting performers from around the world that you’re unlikely to have encountered before.
You may develop interests in cultural aspects of life that carry you through your lifetime.

, Many national chain stores offer discounted retail prices to people who can show a student ID. Among the kinds of items that you might find discounted include books, clothing, school supplies and computers.If you’re not sure how to find student discount, do an online search for the item you’re planning to purchase and the words “student discount”. For example, searching for a new tablet computer, you might find that Apple offers educational discounts on the ipad.
Local businesses also offer student discounts. Grocery stores, bookstores, movie theaters, and restaurants are among the businesses that offer special rates for students.

, Spending a semester studying in another part of the world is something that you may wish to take advantage of. If you’ve been studying a foreign language, going to a country filled with native speakers offers a wonderful chance to solidify your knowledge.You’ll have the fun of learning about another culture up close and in daily life.
There are things you can learn by traveling that you’ll not have the chance to learn in other ways. Going out to another country’s clubs, museums, and restaurants is an experience you’ll remember for your lifetime.

, If you’re passionate about particular subjects that aren’t offered by your college, find another way to study it. One of the perks of being in college is being able to learn anything you want to. Most universities have a way for students to design their own course of studies.This requires seeking out experts and specialists in your area of interest. These people might be at your university, or they might be working professionally in your community.
Be aware that your professor might expect you to be more self-directed in an independent study course than in a typical lecture course. Just because it's independent doesn't mean that there's less work involved.

Listen to music while you study.,
Make your study social.,
Try studying with different mediums.,
Reward yourself for hard work.",How to Have Fun in College4," Find the musical soundtrack that enhances your study time. Often people find that listening to music without words is best for concentration. Try listening to gentle orchestral arrangements, piano solos, light jazz, smooth electronica or easy listening to complement your study.


This strategy won’t work for everyone. Some people are distracted by music while they work.
Experiment with different kinds of music until you find the genre or pieces that work best for you. Some people can drown out music even with lyrics.

, Find a group of study companions and plan regular study together. You might try quizzing each other, or making games from the material that will sharpen your knowledge. Talking to one another about the course material can clarify anything that you didn’t quite understand from the lecture.You’re more likely to learn when you’re motivated to study.
If you’re more likely to be distracted from your studies by working together with other students, it’s important to acknowledge this and spend your study time alone. If this is true for you, keep your social time as a reward for your solitary learning.

, Make a poster and draw out the relationships you’re trying to memorize, for example. If you’re musically inclined, set the words you’re trying to learn to music to help you remember them. Make diagrams to illustrate what you’re learning.

Develop a strong work ethic.,
Take advantage of academic opportunities at your current university.,
Research the course of study you want to apply for at Oxford.,
Read the university's Application Guide.,
Decide what college you want to attend.,
Research funding opportunities.,
Choose referees who know your academic work.,
Complete the online application.,
Take an English-language proficiency test if you're not a native speaker or national of majority English-speaking country.",How to Get Into Oxford University2," Study at Oxford is highly rigorous, and they want students who can handle a demanding academic workload. Prove you've got what it takes by investing time in your studies every day.


If you need help balancing your academic load with other commitments (work, family, etc.), talk to your academic advisor for suggestions.
Some Oxford departments require a minimum of a 3.7 GPA (on the 4.0 scale), while others require a minimum of 3.5., You can become a more attractive candidate for graduate study if you've shown a strong interest in your area of study. Chances are your current university offers opportunities to go beyond the required coursework, including clubs related to your subject, extra research opportunities, and internships.


If you're unsure about what opportunities are available to you, ask your academic advisor to point you in the right direction.
Don't forget that your university's library is a major resource. Check out books on your subject and read up on topics that interest you.

, You can do this via the university's website, which has specific pages for each course. Application requirements vary from course to course.


The course pages also provide information about what makes you eligible, particularly with regard to your university grades.

, This guide is available through the graduate admissions page and differs from year to year, so make sure you're reading the guide for your admissions year. Familiarize yourself with the application process and note any and all requirements, including standardized tests, undergraduate transcripts, references (letters of recommendation), and any written work you need to submit.


On the whole, if there are discrepancies between what the course page and the Admissions Guide state regarding the application process, the Admissions Guide takes precedence.
If you have questions, contact the Graduate Admissions and Funding office through the website.
Specific application processes apply to the following programs: the Postgraduate Certificate in Education, said Business School courses, Software Engineering courses, Clinical Medical degrees, the Doctoral Program in Clinical Psychology, and the Foreign Service Program., Graduate students belong to both their department and a college or hall. The colleges and halls are smaller communities within the university, where you'll be assigned a tutor who'll provide academic support. Each college has its own facilities, including accommodation, library, dining hall, and common room.Find out which colleges accept applications for your course of study. You can do this on the course webpage.
Other factors when choosing a college include: accommodation for couples, families and/or students with disabilities; funding opportunities; location within Oxford; and whether it is specifically for graduates (some are a mix of undergrads and grads).
Your application status does not depend on the college you choose. However, you may be reallocated to a college different than the one you've applied to.
Note that you can also make an ""open application,"" and you'll be assigned to a college by the university. In this case, use the code provided on the application to indicate you have no college preference., Unlike US universities, Oxford does not always provide funding for its graduate students, and teaching opportunities, though there are a few, are not institutionalized. You'll need to consider how to finance your graduate study at Oxford, which can be a big investment.


Fortunately, there are a number of funding opportunities available to UK and international students. Learn more on the Fees and Funding page of the university's website., You'll need to provide references as part of your application. Ideally, these should be professors or advisors familiar with your academic work who can speak to your ability and potential for graduate study.


Don't be afraid to ask for letters of recommendation: this is something professors do all the time.
Be sure to ask them well in advance of the deadline.
Give them clear instructions as to the process (for Oxford it's all done online), and when the deadline is. You'll need to register them on the Oxford online application, and then they will receive a reference request.
Oxford does not send reminders about reference deadlines; you are responsible for checking that your referee has submitted the letter on time.
Do not get references from friends or family., Make sure you do so before the deadline for graduate admissions. You may or may not be asked to do an interview, depending on your department.


Use the checklist on the Applications page to ensure you've submitted all necessary application materials.

, Ideally, you should have this done before the application deadline; however, if you complete it after the deadline, have your results sent to Oxford as soon as they're available or submit them yourself electronically. Tests recognized by Oxford include:

Upgrade your graduate's wardrobe.,
Pay for a resume consultation.,
Give a cookbook for beginners.,
Give a set of tools.,
Help furnish their new home.,
Help them plan for a financially stable future.",How to Give a Great College Graduation Gift2," When meeting a prospective employer or starting their first day at a new job, a graduate's casual college wardrobe will not be appropriate in most workplaces. In order to make a positive first impression, they'll need some help professionalizing their closet.


A versatile and stylish blazer can help a graduate upgrade their wardrobe for job interviews. A blazer, rather than a suit jacket, can lend itself to both business casual and business formal workplaces, and it can be paired with multiple outfits.Switch out the backpack for something more professional for job interviews, like a briefcase or messenger bag for men or a leather tote bag for women. Even if the graduate already has a job lined up, more than likely they’ll need a practical and professional case or bag for their new working environment., Nearly every job application requires a resume, but for first-time applicants, it can be difficult to know how to create a strong resume. A resume service can help the graduate craft a professional resume that will catch the eye of prospective employers., Without a campus dining hall or home cooked meals, graduates will have to quickly learn to prepare their own meals. Purchase a cookbook for beginners to give them a good place to start.

, A basic set of tools is a practical gift that just about everybody needs, and it’s a gift that lasts for years. Even if the graduate isn’t handy or doesn't enjoy constructing home projects, a basic set of tools provides the essentials for measuring and hanging pictures, installing TV mounts, or putting together store-bought furniture., More than likely, your college graduate has been relying on dorm furnishings or used hand-me-down furniture. Help them make a fresh start as they transition into their new home with some new furniture that fits within your budget: a couch, futon, mattress, or coffee table., It’s never too early to start planning a financially secure future, but college graduates may not know how to get started or how important early planning can be. Give gifts that will last well into their future.


If the graduate has had legitimate employment with taxable income for the past year, you can contribute to their ROTH individual retirement account up to the amount the graduate earned in the last year. This will jumpstart them to a stable financial future.If the college graduate has no idea how to start planning, pay for a first appointment with a financial advisor. This will give them the education they need to get grounded and will help them construct a plan for the future.

Give an engraved diploma frame.,
Give a monogrammed journal.,
Celebrate with engraved glassware.,
Give an engraved flask.",How to Give a Great College Graduation Gift3," A diploma frame allows the graduate to proudly display their accomplishments in their new home or office. By adding an engraved plaque with a personalized message on the frame, you’ll be sure to give a gift that is unique and special to your graduate.

, Since the graduate is transitioning into a new part of life, they need a new, beautiful journal to mark the occasion and start their adventure. To make the gift more personal, have the journal monogrammed. There are a variety of online stores and retailers, like Etsy and Peter Pauper Press, that provide monogram services., Start the graduation celebration with monogrammed glassware, like wine glasses or beer steins. This gift not only holds a reminder of the graduate’s accomplishments, but it is also a great gift to help them get started on setting up their new kitchen.

, Flasks are staple celebratory gifts, but what makes it a unique gift is a personalized engraving suited to the graduate. Engravings can include their name and date of graduation, or even better, an inspiring quote from their role-model or favorite book.

Pick up your books.,
Buy a calendar or day planner.,
Get all necessary school supplies.",How to Get Organized for College or Grad School1," It’s important that you purchase all the required reading for your classes. Bring a copy of your reading-materials list to the school bookstore, and check off each subject you buy the books for one by one. When you are finished, double check to ensure you haven’t missed any.Your teacher will not provide any materials they’ve asked you to secure. It’s also unlikely you can “borrow” a book from the teacher, as you might have been able to in high school.
Consulting your syllabi, organize your schoolbooks at home in the chronological order you will need them. You’ll be ready to read your way through the year and won’t struggle to find a title when you need it.;
, While at the bookstore, purchase a calendar that extends many months out, so you can keep track of dorm events, exams, papers and thesis presentations. Choose a planner that’s easy to carry with you and has plenty of space to create notes.While digital planners are available, a paper planner enables you to see tasks for many months at a time at a glance. Many digital planners show a marker to indicate you have something a given day, but require you to click further to see relevant details. A paper planner, however analog, shows you all events and relevant notes easily.
Put important syllabi dates in your calendar before you start classes. You can hit the ground running and see what will be due right away, while everyone else is still getting oriented., Look over your syllabi and take stock of the basic school supplies you will need to complete the assignments listed, such as binders, pens, dividers, and notepaper. Make a list, checking off any you already own. Purchase any you don’t have from an office supply store, such as OfficeMax or Staples.


Color coding can help keep your materials for different subjects better organized. Simply assign a color to each subject and purchase a binder, notebook, etc. for that class in that color. It will make keeping track of your notes and materials easier if you always know where to look.
Get a sheet of stickers in each color as well. You can code handouts, too, so you know at a glance what subject they belong to.

Keep a copy of your class schedule in your calendar.,
Map out your class routes on campus.,
Create reading-assignment bookmarks.,
Make a study schedule.,
Prioritize your assignments.",How to Get Organized for College or Grad School2," The first few weeks of college or grad school it can be difficult to remember exactly what time each class starts and what days they meet. Create a master schedule of a typical week and tape it on the inside front cover of your calendar so you can always have it with you for reference. You can include not only classes, but also any internships, music lessons, or recurring appointments you’ll need to contend with on a weekly basis., Unlike high school grounds, college and graduate campuses can be large and confusing. Before the first day of class get a campus map and mark where each of your class buildings is located. This will help you know how where your classes are relative to one another.


If you have time before the first day of school, it can be helpful to do a dry run of the routes you’ll take to from building to building. This will give you a better idea of walking time and help you familiarize yourself with the best way to go.
If you’re someone who plans to bike on campus, you can also note good places to lock your bike, for example. Or if you’ll need to grab lunch between classes, you can find a good place on the way or plan to bring a snack.

, At the beginning of your semester, make an index card bookmark with the pages assigned and corresponding due dates for each of your books. For example, for your Chemistry book, you’d write “Chemistry” at the top of an index card with 9/5: 1-47; 9/12: 48-102; 9/19: 151-160; 9/26: 161-194. This way, whenever you have a spare moment, even without your syllabus, you can get some reading done.If you prefer a digital approach, make digital reading assignment notecards using the “Notes” app or something similar in your phone. That way, even if you just have your phone and book with you, you’ll know what to read.

, Take a look at your class schedule and see when your free time falls. Use this information in combination with the time of day you feel most productive to create a study schedule. By scheduling time to study and do work for each of your subjects, you’ll maintain better organization and keep on top of your work.


For example, if you’re a morning person and have lots of free time in the mornings every Thursday, that would be a good time to tackle studying for your most difficult subject.

, On Sunday of every week, look at the week ahead and make a list of all the assignments that are due in your various classes. Next to each estimate how long it will take you. If you’re not precisely sure how many hours, break it down into days. Is it an assignment that can be done in one day, or will it take more? Assign each project an appropriate place (or multiple) in your study schedule based on your estimate.


It can be helpful to leave one study session a week that you set aside for studying but don’t allocate to a particular assignment. Use this window as a buffer to complete any assignments that run beyond the time you’d anticipated.

Create a computer filing system.,
Set up an email filter for your different subjects.,
Use your smartphone to create reminders for important events.",How to Get Organized for College or Grad School3," Whether you like to save your essays locally, on a flash drive for your computer, or through a cloud service like Google Drive, iCloud Drive, or Microsoft OneDrive, set up a filing system for your classes ahead of time. Make one folder for each of your classes and subfolders for any recurring type of assignment, like a weekly writing exercise.You can even color code your digital folders to match your real life color-coding system for even more precise organization.

, You can set up filters to funnel messages from your professors into individual class folders as they come in. This way, you’ll never have to dig through your email trying to find that one special email your professor sent with an important addendum or due date change., Whether it’s an orientation meeting for freshmen or a one-on-one with a teacher, it can be helpful to schedule digital reminders for one-off events that might disrupt your normal schedule. Most phones have calendar features that will remind you of an upcoming event 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or 30 minutes beforehand. Use these to help yourself keep on top of new or last-minute meetings you might forget to consult your regular calendar about.

Work when you need to work and play when its time to play.,
Prioritize learning rather than a given grade.,
Assess wasted time.,
Keep your room clean and clutter free.,
Keep your backpack clean.",How to Get Organized for College or Grad School4," It may seem straightforward, but try to simply be where you are supposed to be without worrying about the other facets of your life. If you’ve made a good study schedule that addresses your academic needs, you’ll feel much more at ease on a free night hanging out with your friends.


Try not to overdo alcohol, which can leave you with a hangover and cut into your productivity the following day. It is difficult to catch up.
Especially if you are in graduate school—often at a job during the day and taking classes at night—it is critical to use your time as you have allotted it. You will start to fall short professionally if you’re always finishing your grad school homework on your lunch break. Similarly, your academic performance will suffer if you’re working on a PowerPoint while you’re supposed to be listening to a lecture. It may be helpful to schedule the hours of your workday just as you schedule your study time to keep yourself on track. Try to break the day into tasks that will happen before lunch and tasks that will happen after.

, In the later years of college and especially in graduate school, you’ll be focusing more on your major rather than fulfilling course requirements. As you focus more intently on the subject you came to school for, it is the right time to let go of perfectionism. Focus on getting the most out of your lessons rather than a perfect score. Absorbing more information that interests you will serve you better as you make career decisions going forward.This doesn’t mean that you should check out of classes that don’t interest you, but rather, that you should devote more of your time to what really piques your interest. You may find that in doing so, the social and academic aspects of your life can enhance one another.
For example, if you love not just writing, but specifically play writing, use could use your social time to see performances. Both parts of your life will benefit.

, If you find you’re having trouble getting everything you want done, take an honest look at how you’re using your work or study time. If you’re spending 10 minutes of every hour refreshing your email browser or playing an internet game, you’re not getting the most out of your attention span. Having to begin tasks many times over will disrupt your social, academic and work schedules.


If you find that despite your best efforts, you are falling behind, it might make sense to reassess your commitments. Dropping a class or activity can buy back some critical time if you’re already maximizing your attention and organizational scheduling.

, Whether you have your own room or you share a room, keep what you can clean. Get in the habit of tidying your living area everyday before you sit down and do your homework. This will keep your head clear so you can focus on your work. Don't bring all your favorite knickknacks and old yearbooks to college, you will most likely have limited room and having a clutter free space is key to staying organized.

Don't bring anything you won't use often to college, the less stuff you have the more organized you can be.
If you can't focus in your room, study in the library or a similar space.

, Use a backpack to hold only the textbooks and notebooks you need for the classes you have that day. Don't try to fit all your books into your bag if you do not need them. Get in the habit of emptying out your backpack every night, tossing out any trash, and putting only the textbooks and notebooks in it you'll need for the next day."

Talk to people who will be serving the food at the family holiday dinner if you are not the one hosting the dinner yourself.,
Avoid raising the topic of vegetarianism during the meal.,
Try to eat some of the dishes served, as long as they are meat-free.,
Enjoy yourself.",How to Survive Family Holidays As a Vegetarian," This will give you a chance to learn what's being served and if there's anyway it can be easily modified to fit you lifestyle. If there will not be enough acceptable food, then offer to bring a dish of your own.

Offer to bring a dish others can eat. Vegetarian or not, everyone needs their vegetables. Plus, what better way to convince people that vegetarianism isn't awful than bring a delicious dish?
It is important to make it clear that you're offering by way of making things easier, not taking over. Make a suggestion that your dish will be ready to heat and won't cause anyone a bother.;
, At the dinner, try not to make too much of a big deal about your lifestyle as it will annoy other people. People are gong to be less accepting if you are talking about how bad meat is and how great vegetarianism is. They will feel defensive and chances are, you will end up making your family mad.

Don't preach about how bad meat is when at the meal table. People make and live with their own choices. If they wish to discuss this aspect of vegetarianism with you, they'll let you know. On the other hand, if they argue with you openly, you are entitled to defend yourself. It depends on your family culture as to whether or not mealtime argumentative discussions are permitted; if not, politely suggest that the discussion be had later.

, If you make an effort, then people will be less annoyed or act offended when you come across a food that you can't eat. Compliment the chef on the food you can eat.

Remember that there are many reasons for avoiding certain dishes, not just vegetarianism. This includes dislike, allergies, faith-based reasons, being full and only wanting to try some of the dishes. There's no need to make a big fuss, just take what you can and enjoy it to the fullest.

, No one will enjoy the holiday if everyone is negative. Have a bundle of alternative topics to discuss to divert potential arguments during dinner. Ask about what other people have been doing lately, follow up on things you know about family members, raise topical issues, and so forth. By being chatty about the things others are interested in, you can quickly shut down any negativity thrown your way. Most of all, try not to focus on food, but on the holiday cheer!"

Free up oven space by making a side dish in a slow cooker.,
Use a slow cooker for dips and drinks.,
Keep time in mind regarding holiday events.",How to Use Your Slow Cooker for Holiday Entertaining1," With a slow cooker, you usually add the ingredients and then walk away. It's safe to leave the slow cooker on unattended, but you need to make sure there's nothing flammable nearby. Clear the countertop where you placed the slow cooker for safety.During the holidays especially, there may be many items on your counter. It's especially important to keep things like plastic containers filled with cookies away from the slow cooker, as these items are flammable.;
, Over the holidays, you're probably cooking a lot, especially for parties. A slow cooker can come in handy here. If you need the oven for a main course, try preparing a side dish in the slow cooker. This can cut down on your total cooking time.

, Dips and drinks can be a big hit at holiday events. These types of snacks can easily be made in a slow cooker. Slow cookers generally require less maintenance during the cooking process, so making your refreshments in a slow cooker allows you to focus on decorating while everything's cooking.


Also, things like fondues can easily be served in a slow cooker. This will cut down on dishes you need to do after a party.

, If you're planning a holiday party, you need to keep an eye on time. See how long your recipe takes to cook. Make sure you get a dish into the slow cooker in this time frame. It's a good idea to have a little wiggle room, however, as you may sometimes have to cook things a little longer than the recipe recommends.

Beat the herb mixture together with whole eggs and bake. The result is an immensely flavorful frittata that can be sliced and savored hot or cold.Make sure you bake on a low heat (around 350°F, or 176°C)) so that you don’t dry out the herbs.
Kookoo sabzi is a popular dish that is almost always eaten on the first day of Nowruz.;
, This recipe is known as dolmeh in most countries of the Middle East. Fill tender grape leaves with small handfuls of ground beef and rice and roll them up and drop them in a pot of shallow olive oil, water, sugar and lemon juice. Cook for an additional half hour at a low temperature, then serve as an satisfying snack or side dish.Wrapping dolmeh by hand can be time-consuming, but it’s guaranteed to please once it comes out of the oven. It can also be a fun way to get your other family, friends and guests involved in the cooking process.The traditional way to roll Persian dolmeh is into small squared bundles.

, Cut fresh Persian cucumbers into small chunks. Throw them into a mixing bowl with yogurt, crushed garlic, sliced shallots, salt and pepper and toss thoroughly. Chill for one hour to let the ingredients thicken and the flavors mingle.Spread maast-o khiar over warm flatbread, spoon it onto a plate of meat and rice or eat it by itself like a salad.

, After rolling out hunks of yeasty dough, pull, stretch and knead them until they take on an oblong shape. Use the tip of your finger to trace deep grooves into the top of the bread and brush with a thin mixture of plain yogurt and water. Sprinkle with salt and sesame seeds and bake until golden brown.Use nan-e barbari to scoop up maast-o khiar, or devour it alongside sabzi khordan, a sampling of savory vegetables, herbs, nuts and feta cheese.
To save time, many Persian chefs use store bought pizza dough to make nan-e barbari., Considered a staple of Nowruz, sabzi polo is centered around the herbed rice, which is layered with herbs and cooked to a crispy brown finish at the bottom of a hot pot. The rice is usually eaten with fish like tilapia or bass that is baked or smoked to perfection.For added depth of flavor, season your sabzi polo with advieh—a blend of dry spices containing cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, cumin and crushed rose petals.Sabzi polo is ordinarily served for lunch on the first day of the new year., This hearty noodle soup calls for thick handmade noodles (reshteh), fresh herbs, vegetables and kashk, a dairy derivative similar to whey. Asheh reshteh is heavy enough to work as a filling companion to other entrees or as a meal of its own.If you’re unable to find or make reshteh, linguini makes an acceptable substitute.Powdered whey and water can also fill in for kashk if you’re in a pinch.

, Chelo kebab is the National Dish of Iran, which makes it a fitting addition to a dinner table set for Nowruz. Pair skewers of ground beef or lamb with steamed and buttered Basmati rice. Serve with grilled tomatoes and yogurt on the side.This is an excellent meal to fix if you’re expecting a lot of guests, as you can prepare a large quantity of each of the major components at once and dish them up after everyone has arrived.
Chelo kebab is often accompanied by doogh, a beverage consisting of yogurt, water, dried mint and salt., To make ghormeh sabzi, combine ground beef or lamb meat with kidney beans and an abundance of herbs and spices like parsley, cilantro, fenugreek, scallions and turmeric, then heat it in a covered pot or slow cooker for an hour and a half to two hours. When it’s ready, you’ll have a delightfully tender and savory stew that’s both tasty and nutritionally complete.Add tartness and complexity to the stew by simmering it with dried limes.Don’t worry if you end up with leftovers—ghormeh sabzi is usually just as good (or even better) when reheated.

, Combine rice flour, confectioner’s sugar and clarified butter in an electric mixer and flavor with tangy rosewater. Bake the cookies until they begin to brown slightly. Nan-e berenji are crisp, sweet and aromatic, perfect for a light after-dinner treat.Dust the top of the cookies with poppy seeds and cardamom powder right when they come out of the oven.These could also make a great addition to a picnic luncheon or edible gift basket.

, Parboil thin vermicelli noodles to soften them up, then move them to the refrigerator. While the noodles are chilling, heat water and granulated white sugar to form a syrup, to which you’ll add a tablespoon of rosewater and a splash of freshly squeezed lime juice. Portion the noodles into small cups and top with crushed pistachios and sour cherries.Faloodeh is one of the oldest cold desserts in the world, making it a beloved favorite for Nowruz.
Rake the noodles with a fork as they chill to keep them from sticking together., For a more substantial dessert that can satisfy the strongest craving for sweets, look no further than koloocheh. Mix a rich bread dough with yeast, milk, eggs, butter and yogurt and knead it with a generous helping of cinnamon sugar and chopped dates and walnuts. Roll the mounds into softball-sized discs and bake them to a light brown color.Koloocheh dough is not finished until the top has been decorated with a series of circles. These are representative of good fortune in the new year and are also a practical measure, allowing the dense dough to ventilate as it bakes.
Add a few extra ounces of ice cold water to your koloocheh dough for a light, airy consistency similar to brioche., Who doesn’t love a little ice cream after dinner? This particular frozen treat (like all the most delicious Persian confections) is infused with rosewater for a hint of floral flavor. On the stop top, slowly simmer whole milk with whipped eggs, sugar, vanilla extract and ground saffron. This will produce a luscious custard that can then be finished in an ice cream maker.Garnish bastani Irani with pistachios or plucked rose petals.
If you don’t have an ice cream maker, you can freeze the custard for 4-5 hours, whisking intermittently to smooth and break up icy chunks."

Stir the ingredients together using a spoon, until they are well blended.You can also add ⅛ teaspoon of freshly ground nutmeg for added flavour.;
, In a separate bowl, whisk together 1 large egg, 1 ¼ cup of milk, ¼ cup of unsalted melted butter, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Use a large whisk to blend together all of the ingredients.In order to melt the butter, measure out the necessary amount and place it in a small bowl. Heat the butter for 15-20 seconds in the microwave, or until fully melted.

, Once the dry and wet ingredients have been blended in separate bowls, pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredient bowl. Stir the dry and wet ingredients together until you form a fairly thick batter.Avoid over mixing. The combined batter should be slightly lumpy.

, If you do not have all of the ingredients to make pancakes from scratch, you can also try making pancakes using a pancake mix purchased from the grocery store. Read the ingredients on the back of the package before purchasing because sometimes you will be required to add eggs, milk, water, and/or vegetable oil to the mix.Follow the directions provided on the box in order to blend and create the pancake batter.
The box will provide detailed instructions and even pictures to help guide you through the cooking process.

, Before you start cooking the pancakes, preheat the pan to a medium heat. You should also grease the pan slightly with either oil or a pat of butter. This will help to ensure that the pancakes do not stick to the pan and break while being flipped.

, Once the pan is heated and the butter has melted onto the pan, you can begin to pour the pancake batter. In order to create snowman pancakes, you should pour the batter in two or three different-sized circles. Depending on the size of your pan, you will likely only be able to cook one snowman at a time.Pour one large circle (4 inches or 10 cm wide) to act as the base, a medium circle (2 inches or 5 cm wide) to act as the body, and a small circle (1 inch or 2.5 cm wide) to act as the head.
Once you have finished cooking the pancakes, arrange them into the shape of a snowman on a separate plate.

, Alternatively, you can pour the batter directly into the shape of a snowman. To do this, pour one large circle about 4 inches (10 cm) wide and then a small circle about 2 ½ inches (6 cm) wide. Make sure that you pour these two circles close together so that as the batter runs they touch forming one pancake that is shaped like a snowman., Cook the pancakes until little bubbles begin to pop on the top of the batter.

The vines will have purple flowers on them that smell very similar to grapes. The leaves are green and tri-cornered with small hairs on their skin. If you choose to harvest wild kudzu, make sure that the area has not been sprayed with pesticide.Be careful that you do not harvest poison ivy instead. This plant is often found mixed in with kudzu, but its leaves are smaller.;
, If you are interested in the kudzu blossoms, then visit the patch between July to September. If you are hoping to harvest the roots, they are best accessed in the fall and winter with some of the surrounding foliage has died off. Pick off the young leaves in the spring and early summer for maximum tenderness., Use a pair of garden shears or heavy scissors to sever the thin stem connecting each kudzu flower to the larger vine. Gently add the flower to your basket or harvest sack being careful not to crush them. Most of the flowers grow at the base of the plant, so you will not have to pull down too many high-climbing vines.Keep fresh kudzu flowers in the refrigerator for up to one day before processing or cooking.

, Use a sharp knife, heavy scissors, or garden shears to separate each leaf from the vine. For the best taste, choose leaves that are smaller, young-looking, and bright green. Place the leaves in your basket and do not crush them.It is possible to cook with the larger “poke” leaves but these are often tough and chewy in texture. Also, be sure that any leaves that you choose are free of any sign of bites by animals or insects., Get a small shovel and dig up the surface roots, which are around 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter and only a few feet deep in the ground. If you feel up to a challenge, use a larger shovel and attempt to remove some of the deeper tubers, which can weigh upwards of 200 pounds. Make sure that you wear gloves while digging., If you want a kudzu cooking product that will last longer, then go to your local Asian market or search online for kudzu starch. This starch comes in a variety of forms including jarred powder, heavy chunks, or sliced flakes. The color determines the price and quality, with whiter starches being more expensive. Read the labels carefully before buying., As soon as you bring the harvested plant pieces into your home, take them to a sink and give them an extended warm water rinse. It might be easier to pour them into a colander for this part. Move the pieces around to ensure that you’ve removed all stems and dirt. Also, keep an eye out for kudzu bugs.


Lay the pieces out to dry on a towel when you are finished.
If you are cleaning the roots, then you may want to use a scrub brush to remove any caked on dirt.

, It is possible to eat the leaves raw, but many people prefer to boil them in order to remove the fine hairs that coat the surface of the leaf. Start by bringing a large pot of water up to boiling. Put the leaves into the water and leave them for about a minute. Spoon them out and allow them to dry before eating or cooking.Follow the same process for any green vine tips that you pick. The vine tips are particularly nutritious and filled with good proteins., After you’ve washed off the roots, go ahead and peel them just like you would with a sweet potato. Use an industrial strength peeler or sharp knife, if necessary. Then, you can bake, roast, grate, shred, or even pound the root flat. Some people grind them into a fine powder, like what is sold in stores.If you mash the peeled roots, continue to do so until they form a grey paste. Use a screen to filter the paste with water until the color begins to lighten to white. Then, set the paste out to dry in a room temperature, often dark, space for up to two months.Some people dry the paste on a mesh rack, while others simply set the paste blocks on wax paper on a shelf. Make sure that the drying area is clean and free of dust or pests.

, The green, fuzzy pods that hang from the vines via small stems are not suitable for human consumption. As you are processing your harvest, go ahead and toss both the pods and the seeds therein., Any dried kudzu powder that you do not use should be placed in an airtight container and stored in a cool, dry location. Fresh leaves and blossoms can be stored in the refrigerator for a few days in an airtight container. Placing a damp paper towel with them can retain some of their moisture., Place four cups of Kudzu blossoms in a colander. Give them a quick wash with cold water and then transfer them to a bowl. Add in four cups of boiling water. Place this bowl into a refrigerator and let cool for eight hours. Strain out and discard the blossoms. Mix one tablespoon lemon juice and one package of pectin with the blossom liquid in a saucepan. Bring to a boil and add five cups of sugar. Keep stirring. Remove from heat and pour into jelly jars.As a final step for canning, seal the jars and submerge them in boiling water for five minutes. Allow to cool before storing.
The blossoms will add a subtle grape-like taste to the jelly. For a stronger taste, add more blossoms into the original mixture., In a medium bowl, stir together three eggs, one cup heavy whipping cream, ½ teaspoon salt, a pinch of ground pepper, one cup grated mozzarella cheese, and one cup chopped Kudzu leaves. Pour into an unbaked pie shell and bake for 35 to 45 minutes. Remove and let cool., Add some water to a saucepan or kettle on the stove. Bring to boiling and stir in some kudzu leaves or kudzu powder. Use a strainer to remove the leave pieces and allow it to cool. The final product will contain slight earthy undertones, almost similar to a drink infused with snow peas. Some people prefer to boost the sweetness with a sprig of mint.Some people say that kudzu tea can help a person fight off a cold or other illness.

, Get a handful of fresh, green kudzu leaves. Ideally, choose ones that are about 2-inches in size. Make a batter out of water and flour and any preferred spices. Dip the leaves into the batter and then place them into a skillet with some hot oil. Fry on both sides until crispy. Remove and drain on a paper towel.These chips are best when eaten warm shortly after cooking. They will taste similar to fried pea pods.

, Place a bit of oil into a skillet or wok and heat it up. Add in some ginger, garlic cloves, tamari, bok choy, and kudzu powder or leaves to taste. Pour in ¼ cup of water or more. Cook on low heat until the bok choy or leaves are fully cooked. It should take about five minutes.The taste of kudzu leaves is often compared to that of lettuce or kale., Kudzu powder is a particularly good way to add some substance to watery gravies or puddings. Add 1 ½ tablespoons of kudzu powder for every one cup of liquid. Increase the powder by ½ tablespoons for an even thicker final product. Keep whisking the liquid until any large clumps are broken down.Placing the mixture in a saucepan over medium heat until simmering can speed up the process of thickening.
Kudzu powder has a very non-descript taste and can take on the flavors of any strong ingredients that it is paired with. That is why it is a good idea to use flavorful spices or foods, such as garlic, when cooking with kudzu.

, Get a saucepan and mix together one can of coconut milk, two tablespoons of maple syrup, one tablespoon of lime zest, ¼ cup of lime juice, one teaspoon of vanilla extract and ¼ teaspoon salt. Turn up the heat to medium and simmer. Add in three tablespoons of kudzu powder and let thicken. Pour into cups and allow it to cool.Top the pudding with baked, chopped pistachios.

Use secateurs to trim 10 centimeter (3.9 in) - 15 centimeter (5.9 in) from each shoot, as required. Avoid cutting back into woody, leafless branches.When harvesting basil, nip out with scissors or between finger and thumb, the tips of the plants back to just above a pair of leaves. New growth will emerge at this point. Don't nip just below the leaf, leaving a short stem, as this will simply wither., Take the herb leaves off the stem.

, Run cool water over the herbs in a colander. If you have a salad spinner, use that to dry the herbs, a few sprigs at a time.


If you do not have a spinner, dry the herbs between layers of paper towels, patting them down gently to remove as much water as possible.







, Lay the herbs on a paper towel. Cover the sheet, but make sure that there aren't too many herbs on it. Place another paper towel on top of the herbs.

, Let them dry for about 2 minutes. Check them every 30 seconds to make sure that they don't get burned.

, Take the paper towel out of the microwave and let the herbs rest for a couple of minutes. This way the moisture from the microwave will evaporate into the air.

, Pat the fruit dry with paper towels to soak up any excess water.

, Position the strawberries horizontally and slice the tops off with a sharp knife, so that you end up with a clean and flat top.

, You can leave them whole, but cutting them will allow the maximum amount of flavor to soak in.

, The most basic and easiest approach is to use two tablespoons of sugar per pound (450g) of strawberries.For variations, try one of the following suggestions:


1/2 cup simple syrup for 2 cups strawberries2 tablespoons Cointreau and 2 tablespoons icing sugar (sifted) for 2 cups strawberries1/4 cup honey and 4 tablespoons orange flavored liqueur for 2 pints (2 cups whole) strawberries., Prepare your mixture in a separate bowl before adding the strawberries.

, Lighten up plain yogurt and stir them for a sweet nutritious breakfast.

Wash the knife, cutting board, and vegetables.,
Peel the vegetable if you want to.,
Cut rounded vegetables into a rectangle.,
Chop the vegetable into chunks that are 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) long.,
Slice the vegetable down the length.,
Stack 2-3 slices and cut again.",How to Julienne1," Clean the knife and cutting board with hot water and soap, and be sure to rinse both off thoroughly. Your vegetables don’t need to be washed with soap, but rinse with hot water and consider scrubbing with a cloth or brush.


Use a sharp, non-serrated knife for cutting. A chopping knife works well but is not required. It’s important to only use a sharp knife so you can make clean cuts.;
, Potatoes and carrots are often peeled before being julienned. It is up to you depending on how you plan to eat them. If you don’t peel your potatoes, at least make sure buds or eyes are removed from the skin.








Use a peeler or a paring knife to remove the skin.

, Cut off the stem and bottoms when necessary. Slice off one side at a time so you are left with a rectangular chunk of vegetable. You can throw the scraps away, or you can slice them up and mix them in with the uniform pieces you’ll cut later.








This is especially helpful for potatoes, zucchini, and squash.

, If you are going to be eating the pieces raw, they can be a little longer, but if you’re cooking with them, 2-3 inches is best. Each chunk does not have to be the exact same length, just divide the vegetable evenly.









The general rule for juliennes is that you’d be able to eat them in one bite, but you can cut them into longer chunks if you want.

, When cutting juliennes, ⅛ in (0.3 cm) to 1








Be careful not to cut yourself as you slice.

, Flip the slices you’ve just cut so that they are piled on top of each other. Then cut them into sticks that are ⅛ in (0.3 cm) to 1/16 in (0.15 cm) thick, again. The goal with juliennes is to get them all to a fairly uniform size.








"
"
Remove the top and tail portions.,
Cut the onion in half.,
Slice diagonally toward the center of the onion.",How to Julienne2," The stem and tail pieces aren’t needed for juliennes, so cut them off and throw them away. You can also peel off the outer skin layers of the onion so that you have just the flesh left.









Onions tend to be a little firmer than many other vegetables, so make sure your knife is sharp before you start. A dull knife will make the process much harder.
Make sure the top and bottom are chopped off in a nice smooth cut.

, Since onions are generally about the size that you want julienne sticks to be lengthwise, there is no need to cut an onion into a rectangle or into chucks. Simply cut it in half from top to bottom.








, With the onion laying flat side down, slice at an angle so that pieces stay at a uniform thickness. As you near the halfway point, your knife should be at 90 degrees. Flip the onion on its side and continue cutting.








Perform the same process with the second half of the onion.

"
Set up the mandoline on a sturdy surface.,
Choose your blade and set the thickness.,
Cut the fruit or vegetable into smaller chunks.,
Secure the fruit or vegetable to the hand guard.,
Move the fruit or vegetable back and forth quickly over the blade.",How to Julienne3," Some mandolines have a container to catch the food as it is sliced, but if not, make sure you have a container under it. Set the mandoline on your cutting board, or on the counter or table, and be sure it will not slide around as you slice.








, Different models will have different options. If yours has multiple blades, then pick which is best for what you are cutting. If your mandoline has adjustable thickness, then set it to where you want it to cut.








If you don’t know exactly how the blades will cut, grab a potato and try out each blade so you can figure out when you’ll want to use which blade.
You can also test out the various thickness settings so you can see what works best for the dish you are planning to make.
Mandoline blades are incredibly sharp, so always handle carefully.
Besides thickness, the blades may also cut in a specific pattern or texture, which is important to know ahead of time. If you want matchsticks but you have a waffle cut blade, you’re not going to get what you want.

, Most mandolines won’t fit an entire cucumber, large potato, or whole onion. If the piece you are going to slice seems too big for the mandoline, cut it into smaller chunks that will fit better.







, The hand guard is not an optional piece of the mandoline, so don’t take it as such. Always secure the piece of food to it before you begin cutting. As you cut, pay attention to where your fingers are so they never get too close to the blade.








Even with the hand guard, it’s possible for your fingers to slip off it toward the blade, so always be careful and watchful of where your fingers are.

, Mandolines work best when you slice quickly, and their sharpness is designed for this. Don’t go so fast that you rock the mandoline back and forth, but you don’t need to go slowly.









Pay attention to where the slices fall to make sure they don’t stack up so high that they block the blade, which could cause you problems.
Keep your hand tight on the hand guard as you slice.

Do this gently or you may break the egg. Don’t throw away the yolk. Put the yolk for each egg into a bowl., Put the salad cream in with the egg yolks. Mash the yolks and salad cream together. Then, add in some of the chopped cherry tomatoes, cooked bacon bits, cress, and sliced spring onions in the bowl with the egg yolks and salad cream., Use a spoon to put the yolk mixture into the middle of the halved hard-boiled eggs. Spoon just enough mixture in to fill the eggs where the yolks used to be. Place the eggs on a plate and serve immediately.Cover the leftovers and store them in the refrigerator. Eat them within a few days.

",How to Dehydrate Sweet Potatoes," Brush the outside with a vegetable scrubber to remove dirt. Run the sweet potato under running water, brushing off dirt and other particles with your hands. Pat it dry with a clean towel.


Leave the skin on for additional nutrients. For this reason, buy pesticide-free sweet potatoes if possible.;
, Prepare a sharp knife or mandolin. Use the mandolin on the thinnest setting,or slice the sweet potato into rounds that are one-sixteenth to one-eighth inch (0.16 to 0.3cm) thick. A mandolin is ideal, because it will ensure all the rounds are the same thickness, which means they’ll dehydrate at the same rate.


To use a mandolin, press the top of the sweet potato to the mandolin slicer and move in a downward motion, slicing the sweet potato rounds until you reach the end of your potato. Use the vegetable holder to ensure you don’t cut your hands on the sharp mandolin.

, Fill a large bowl full of fresh, room temperature water. Soak the sweet potato slices for one to two hours. The starch in the sweet potato will prevent moisture from escaping, but soaking will help remove some of the starch, leading to crispier sweet potato chips.You can change the water halfway through the soaking process, but this step is not necessary.

, When they are finished soaking, remove the sweet potato rounds from the water and place them on a clean towel or paper towel. Pat them completely dry before dehydrating.

, Transfer the sweet potato rounds to a large plate. Brush them with olive oil or melted coconut oil.Alternatively, place the sweet potato rounds into a bowl, drizzle with oil, and toss to coat.


Oil is not necessary to dehydrate sweet potatoes, but it will result in crispier chips.

, You can make your sweet potato chips sweet or savory, and add any seasonings you desire. You can try:


Himalayan or sea salt
Black pepper or cayenne pepper
CinnamonRosemary or thyme
Onion powder or smoked paprika, Make sure they are only one layer thick, and that the sweet potato pieces aren’t sitting on top of each other. They won’t dehydrate evenly if they are overlapping.

, Replace the dehydrator trays one at a time, stacking them on top of one another. Turn on your dehydrator. For a quicker dehydrating method, set your dehydrator to 145 F (63 C).


For raw sweet potato chips, set the dehydrator to 115 F (46 C)., For the quicker method, dehydrate for about 12 hours, or until the desire crispiness is achieved.For the slower, raw method, dehydrate for 20 to 24 hours.When there are only a few hours left in your estimated dehydrating time, check on your sweet potato chips every hour or so to ensure you don’t overcook them.

, When your dehydrating time is up and your sweet potato chips are crunchy enough for your liking, let them cool on the trays. When they reach room temperature, put them in an airtight resealable bag, mason jar, or other container.


Properly stored dehydrated food, especially without oil, can last for about a year., The ideal temperature for raw dehydration is 115 F (46 C) and below. You can also dehydrate sweet potato at 145 F (63 C). If your oven doesn’t go that low, you will have to keep a closer eye on the chips and adjust the dehydrating time.

, This can be used as a makeshift dehydrator that will allow air to circulate underneath the sweet potato pieces. Spread the sweet potato rounds out in a single layer on the cooling rack.

, Place the tray in the oven with the door ajar. Check on the chips every hour or so if your oven is hotter than 145 F (63 C). When they have reached the desired crispiness, remove them from the oven, cool, and store.


For an oven that goes as low as 115 F (46 C), dehydrate for 20 to 24 hours.
For an oven that’s 145 F (63 C), dehydrate for about 12 hours.
For an oven that doesn’t go lower than 175 F (79 C) or so, dehydrate for three to four hours. If they still need longer, continue dehydrating, but check on them every 15 minutes.

Continue microwaving at low heat.,
Fluff your rice with a fork.,
Opt for the traditional salt, pepper, and butter.,

Substitute chicken or vegetable broth for water.",How to Cook Rice in a Microwave," Rinse the rice you're using under the faucet. Rinse it using a colander or similar device. After rinsing the rice, shake the colander gently to remove any excess water.





;
, Rice is combined with water prior to cooking, but precise ratios vary. Check your package's instructions to figure out the rough rice-to-water ratio. In general, most rices call for two parts rice to one part water.More water will make your rice mushy and less will make it chewy. If you want a mushy or chewy texture, try adding a little more or a little less water than recommended.

, Make sure the dish you choose is safe to put in the microwave. It should say somewhere on the dish. If you can't figure out if a dish is microwave safe, use a different dish to be safe. Place both your rice and water in the dish.








Make sure you choose a dish that's a little bigger than necessary, as rice expands when cooked. Also, a bigger dish will keep it from boiling over as easily
It's not necessary to stir your ingredients when cooking rice.

, Switch the microwave to the highest heat setting it has. Microwave the rice for 10 minutes. Do not cover the rice when microwaving it., After 10 minutes have passed, switch the microwave to low heat. Continue microwaving the rice on low heat for 15 minutes. Leave the rice uncovered.Brown rice can take longer too cook than white rice. When cooking brown rice, you may need to microwave the rice for 20 additional minutes instead of 15.Do not stir the rice in between microwave sessions.

, After the last 15 minutes of cooking, your rice should be ready to eat. Take a fork and gently fluff the rice to give it some texture.If your rice is still stiff when you try to fluff it, cook your rice for a few minutes longer and check it again.
Be careful when removing rice from the microwave. If any water has poured over the container, wait a few moments before handling the rice and use oven mitts.

, You can mix a splash of salt and pepper, as well as a spoonful of butter, into your rice for a classic taste. Butter can be added to the water before you cook the rice or you can melt it in after the rice has cooked.







, If you're making rice as a side dish for something else, borrow from the spices from that dish and mix it into the rice. This will add flavor to the rice and help it pair well with whatever you're cooking.For example, if you're making salmon, add some of the salmon marinade to the rice after cooking it.

, If you want to add flavor while the rice is cooking, opt for chicken or vegetable broth instead of plain water. Using too much chicken broth or water sometimes makes rice taste starchy, so opt for a 50/50 mix of vegetable/chicken broth and water to add flavor to your rice."

Get or make a long metal skewer similar to one you'd use to roast marshmallows on a campfire.,
Start a nice hot wood fire in your fireplace.,
Choose a food to cook.,
Pierce the food with the skewer so that it is securely held by the skewer and will not fall off even with slow rotation.

,
Place a cookie sheet or roasting pan next to the fire to catch drips.

,
Hold the food near the fire, slowly rotating it and changing its position so as to ""rotisserie cook"" it, evenly heating it throughout.,
Continue cooking until the meat is golden brown on the outside and fully cooked on the inside.,
When done to your liking, remove and rest the meat on a plate, cover with foil and let rest a few minutes before serving.

",How to Cook in an Indoor Fireplace1," It should be long enough to hold near the fire comfortably without getting yourself too hot.;
, It will give off more heat if you use hardwoods and let it burn a while before cooking to develop a nice core of hot glowing embers at the base of the fire.

, You can theoretically do just about any solid food but since you will be holding it on a long skewer throughout the cooking, choose something relatively small. Sausages, hot dogs, and meat balls are good basic starting points. If you want to get a bit more adventurous, try some small, seasoned game birds like quail, squab, poussin, partridge or grouse.

,,, Do not hold the food directly in the fire as it will burn very quickly! Just close enough to slowly heat it.

, If you are not sure, it can help to use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature when you think it is getting close.

,"
"
Place a nail or hook into the wall or mantle above your fireplace.

,
Prepare a good hardwood fire, waiting until you have a good core of embers and it is giving good heat.,
Marinate and/or season a roast of your choice.,
Once your meat roast is seasoned, tie it securely with a very long piece of kitchen twine.,
Hang the roast in front of the fire from the nail or hook above your fireplace.,
Place a large cookie sheet or roasting pan just below the roast to catch dripping fat and juices.

,
Give the roast a slight spin so that it rotates on the string.,
Continue adding wood to the fire as needed during the cooking process to keep a good, hot fire going.

,
Baste your meat periodically and wet the string just above it with water to keep it from drying out and breaking.

,
Continue cooking however long is required to reach the level of doneness you desire.,
When done, simply cut the string and remove the roast to a dish or plate, cover with foil and let rest before carving.

",How to Cook in an Indoor Fireplace2,", Holding your hand directly in front of the fire at the front edge of the fireplace opening should be uncomfortable.

, The easiest choice is a leg of lamb with the shank bone intact. However, you can also roast whole chicken or game hens this way. If you get crafty with your kitchen twine, you can even rig up pork or beef roasts too.

, If you are using a leg of lamb, you simply need to wrap the twine tightly around the shank bone and tie tightly. If you are using a chicken or other roast you need to truss the roast in a way such that it can be hung by the twine in an upright position (see the video below).

, The roast should be just in front of the middle of the fire. Secure the string to the nail or hook securely.

,, It will spin one direction for a while and then slowly, on its own, begin to rotate back the other way. It should continue spinning back and forth slowly on its own for many minutes. If you notice it slowing down or stopping, periodically give it another gentle spin.

Be sure to let your steak rest for 7 to 10 minutes after removing it from the oven.,
Enjoy your perfectly cooked steak.",How to Cook Steak in the Oven," You'll want a very hot oven to cook the perfect steak.;
, Steaks that are an inch to an inch and a half thick work best for this method. That's because thicker steaks get more time to develop a wonderful outer crust before the inside is drier than a duck's feather. Pretty much, the thinner the steak, the quicker it becomes as dry and hard as it cooks.


It's just as easy to buy and eat two big steaks than it is four small steaks. If your steaks are behemoths, don't be afraid to slice them up (after cooking, of course) in order to serve them. Once they taste these steaks, your guests won't care that two pieces started off as one steak. Because taste is king!


, Excess moisture left on steaks will cause them to steam, not sear. Steamed steak doesn't sound too appetizing, does it? Be sure to take a paper towel and wick away any moisture that's present on your steak before committing it to the glorious fire.








, There are several opinions about how and when to salt your steak. And depending on how you salt your steak, obeying them can be the difference between a really beautiful culinary treat and a tired, dry, excuse for nutrition.









If you don't have a lot of time on your hands, salt your steak immediately before you place it in the piping hot pan. Why? Because, given time, salt draws moisture from the inside of the steak to the outside. And as noted earlier, moisture on the outside of the steak is not great.
If you have more than 45 minutes to spare, try salting the steak three quarters of an hour in advance. The salt will draw salt out to the surface of the steak, but after 30 to 40 minutes, the steak will draw back the salted moisture in a process called osmosis. This gives the steak a wonderful taste and, some say, actually tenderizes it., Yes, your steak will start off over the burner, but the bulk of the cooking will be done in the oven. This method is used by chefs, cooks and restaurateurs the world over. Try it before you knock it!









Use a neutral oil such as pine nut or canola oil instead of a pungent oil like olive oil. This helps respect the natural intensity of the steak's flavor.
You'll know the pan is ready to cook with when the oil starts steaming.

, To avoid any oil splatter, tip the bottom of the pan up slightly by lifting the skillet's handle up in the air. The oil should gather in a small reservoir near the very tip of the pan. Place the steak gingerly inside the pan and lower the skillet's handle back down.









Adjust the steak with tongs to ensure that it's getting equal coverage on the pan (for a better crust), but don't press down on the steak with your tongs in an attempt to ""sear"" the steak. The steak will sear perfectly well on its own, given time. Pressing down just robs your steak of more juicy goodness.


, Cook the steak just long enough to develop some nice color (i.e. flavor) on the first side.

, You won't need as much time on the second side of the steak because it will continue to develop color (from contact with the bottom of the pan) in the oven.








, This step is optional, but a tablespoon or two of butter right before the steak goes into the oven gives the steak a wonderfully rich, nutty taste, along with a richer jus to serve alongside the steak in the end.








, Of course, the time spent in the oven depends on the thickness of the steak (the thicker the steak, the longer cooking time it will require) and your desired level of doneness (after 6 minutes, the steak is probably still medium-rare; after 8 minutes, it's about medium).








, A cooking thermometer is your friend. They're cheap, handy, and exact. With a cooking thermometer in hand, your does or under- and overdone inexactitude are over! Just stick the thermometer into the middle of the steak, and voilà! Here's a little temperature chart you can use to tell whether your steak is done.

120° F (48.8° C) = Rare
130° F (54.4° C) = Medium rare
140° F (60° C) = Medium
150° F (65.5° C) = Medium well
160° F (71.1° C) = Well done


, As the outer layers of the meat cook, they contract. This sends the juices of the steak further into the center, where they accumulate. If you choose to cut up your steak immediately upon removing it from the oven, the juices will run all over the place because they've been trapped in one place. If, however, you let the steak ""rest"" for about 8 or 9 minutes after it's done cooking, the outer layers of meat will relax, allowing the remaining juices to travel back into the entire piece of meat. This creates a much juicier piece of steak.









Rest your steak under a lightly wrapped piece of aluminum foil to help keep it warm while it rejuvenates. Be mindful that the steak will continue to cook during this time.

, Serve with classic steak fare, such as a roast potato, steamed asparagus, and a simple salad on the side.

Gather your food and materials.,
Prepare the food.,
Cook the food in the water bath.,
Sear the meat.",How to Cook Using Sous Vide,"



Digital thermometer: It is preferred that you get a high quality digital thermometer because in sous-vide, it is extremely important that the temperature is correct while pasteurizing, or else the necessary cooking times can change.

Vacuum sealer: Many professional cooks use chamber style vacuum sealers, which are stronger than clamp style vacuum sealers and can package liquids without freezing. The downside is that they are larger, heavier, and cost more than ten times as much as clamp style sealers. Clamp style vacuum sealers, such as FoodSaver, are less expensive, but also not as strong, and they use more expensive bags.

Water baths:

If the cooking time is short, you can use a pot of water on a stove, but since you must watch the temperature closely with a good digital thermometer the whole time, it is not recommended that you use this method if the food requires a long cooking time.
You can also use a counter top food warmer, a commercial rice cooker, an electric burner, a slow cooker (or crock pot), or a roaster. If you use one of these, make sure it uses a manual switch so that the temperature will not be reset when the power is turned on and off. Rice cookers, steam tables and electric burners are preferred over slow cookers and roasters because their temperature is steadier since they are heated from below. These are used with a digital temperature controller. The simplest and cheapest are on-off controllers and work well enough, keeping the temperature at ±2.1°F (±1.2°C). Another type is the PID controller, and although it needs to be tuned to the cooking device being used, it allows only ±0.7°F (±0.4°C) of temperature change.
Laboratory immersion circulators are very popular because they can keep the temperature of a large amount of water to ±0.1°F (±0.05°C). These can be bought on eBay, although if they were used before, they were probably used with carcinogens and pathogens, which means you will need to clean them. You can clean them with bleach, then with vinegar, and finally rinsed with a 70% (140 proof) alcohol. Or, you can just buy a new one. WARNING: Be sure to completely rinse all bleach before cleaning with vinegar. When combined, these two chemicals can create caustic (and very harmful) gas.
Convection steam ovens can cook large amounts of food, but the temperature can change up to 10°F (5°C) in gas models and 5°F (2.5°C) in electrical models.

;
,


Because sous-vide is different from regular cooking and the temperatures are lower, seasoning can be hard. Although the flavor of most herbs and spices won’t change much, some can and will overpower the dish. Because most vegetables need to be cooked at higher temperatures, they should be cooked separately from the meat.

Marinating will not cause any problems unless it contains alcohol; this may cause the meat to cook unevenly because the alcohol can change from liquid to vapor while cooking. To solve this problem, just cook the alcohol before marinating.
Some people find that extra virgin olive oil makes the food taste metallic.]

, When you find a recipe, it's very important that you follow it strictly, in order to prevent bacterial growth (see Warnings below). Pay careful attention to the ingredients (some acids, salts and spices help to control microorganisms) and temperature. Submerge the pouches completely in the water (sometimes they'll float and you'll have to weigh or pin them down), and don't crowd them or let them overlap; you want maximum surface area exposed to water so that the food cooks thoroughly. Here are some of the basic methods used in sous vide cooking:


Cook-hold: Vacuum seal the ingredients, pasteurize them, and hold them at 130°F (54.4°C) or above until served. The holding prevents food pathogens from growing, but it can also make the food too soft. Tough cuts of meat can be held at 130°F (54.4°C) for 24–48 hours, but most other foods can only be held for 8–10 hours before getting too tender.
Cook-chill/Cook-freeze: Vacuum seal, pasteurize, and rapidly chill the ingredients (usually in an ice water bath for a specified period of time) in order to avoid sporulation of C. perfringens, which can cause food poisoning.Keep the food cold or frozen until it's reheated right before serving. To prevent botulism, keep the food chilled or frozen as follows before serving:

below 36.5°F (2.5°C) for up to 90 days,
below 38°F (3.3°C) for less than 31 days,
below 41°F (5°C) for less than 10 days, or
below 44.5°F (7°C) for less than 5 days



, This is optional, and is done because food cooked using sous-vide looks poached. Since meat usually is not cooked by poaching, it is seared so that it is browned and has a better flavor. Other foods like fish or skinless poultry, which are traditionally poached, don’t need to be seared. Searing is usually done with a blowtorch. Before blowtorching, brush the meat with vegetable or nut oil. Propane and butane blowtorches can both be used, but butane blowtorches are preferred. Some cooks pan sear using a heavy cast iron pan with smoking vegetable or nut oil.

But, cooking for yourself can help you save money and eat more healthful foods instead of eating fast food or prepared foods. If you try, you can learn to prepare a variety of foods you like.;
,


More time spent in the supermarket means less time spent cooking, so try not to go too often. If you have an idea of what you will make for a few days, you can save yourself several trips.
Keep a shopping list and take it with you. You will make better eating decisions in your kitchen than in the store, and you can check whether you already have items.
Keep a master list of recipes you have tried and liked. Use it whenever you need ideas.
Aim for leftovers, but only for a meal or two. If you're cooking for yourself, it is always your turn to cook. Leftovers give you a respite from cooking, but don't overdo it or you could end up eating the same dish all week. If you do make too much, share it with a friend or freeze it for later. You can even try once a month cooking.
Try new recipes now and then.

, For breakfast, try oatmeal, eggs, fruits, yogurt, and toasted bread or bagels. For lunch or dinner (whichever is the lighter meal), have sandwiches, soup, salad, cheese and crackers, a simple rice bowl, veggies and dip, and so on. None of these foods requires much preparation.

, When you need to restock an item you used up, put it on your shopping list so that you can buy it on your next shopping trip.


Your freezer is an extension of your pantry, but you must be mindful of expiration dates.

, Rice, flour, peanut butter and oatmeal keep well on a shelf in a cool, dry place. Canned goods will last until you open the cans.


Buy fresh vegetables and fruit. These are good for you. They're usually sold by the pound or the piece, so, for example, you can buy one cob of corn at a time, if you prefer. It is easy to microwave one cob of corn, a potato, or a single portion of veggies. The result is similar to steaming.
Get creative. Does your store sell pre-formed burger patties? Is it noticeably more expensive than ground meat in bulk? Get a stack of these and use one or two, crumbled up, for a skillet meal.
Use precooked, deli, and convenience foods if they inspire you to cook. Look around your favorite markets for salad bars and pre-washed greens to buy in moderate quantities. Buy a bag of pre-mixed, frozen stir-fry veggies and use only as much as you need for a meal. Choose frozen, boneless, skinless chicken pieces and use the microwave to defrost just the one or two you need for a meal. Buy frozen ravioli or tortellini and prepare only as much as you plan to eat.
Big containers may cost less than little containers. Often, the difference in quantity between a smaller and a larger package is not proportional to the price. For example, if a half gallon of milk costs $2.50 and a gallon costs $3, it may be less expensive to buy the larger size, then use what you can, and dump any that spoils. A ten-pound bag of potatoes may even cost less than a five-pound bag. If the idea of wasting food bothers you, try to find a friend who will share larger containers, or freeze the excess.

, If you like to buy the larger sizes, see if there is someone who is willing to trade a bit of this for a bit of that.


If you find such a person, consider trading off the cooking itself or starting a freezer cooking group. Or invite each other to dinner now and then.

, If you love baked foods, try making your own muffin mix or pancake mix. Assemble only the dry ingredients. You don't need to cook it immediately. Simply add liquid ingredients when it is time to cook. If you like, you can make yourself only enough muffins or pancakes for breakfast.

Freeze uncooked food in single-sized portions. Go ahead and buy the three-pound package of ground meat, then divide it into half-pound or smaller pouches before you freeze it.
Freeze cooked food for ingredient use. For example, you could sauté a quantity of ground or chopped meat with onions, garlic, and perhaps a seasoning of your choice. Drain off the excess liquid and let it cool for a few minutes; then pack it into containers or freezer bags for later use in all sorts of things. A mixture like this can form the basis for a whole variety of meals. Try it as a jumping-off point for omelets, spaghetti, jambalaya, sloppy joes, or whatever else you like.
Freeze ingredients with a sauce or marinade in a freezer bag. Try chicken breasts with pesto sauce or the salsa of your choice. Prepare several smaller bags at once. When it's time to cook, defrost one or two portions overnight in the fridge and let it marinate right there in the bag.
Freeze completed meals in portions. This is a splendid way to avoid eating many days' worth of leftovers at once, and you won't need to cook when you feel uninspired. See our article on once a month cooking.

, This easy crockpot chicken starts as soft tacos, but the leftover meat can be used in several different follow-up recipes. A roasted chicken can be eaten with side dishes (e.g. mashed potatoes and veggies) the first day, contribute to a chicken skillet, and wind up as the basis for soup. You can do similar things with any other meat. You can either freeze the remaining portion or keep working through it.

, There will probably be days when you don't feel like cooking or don't have time. These are the days to pop some frozen leftovers in the microwave, or to make something simple for your main meal. An omelet or tuna melt can be prepared quickly and with minimal effort.

, Make your own one person chocolate cake in a mug. Make fresh bread or muffins for yourself. You can freeze the dough or the finished baked goods, depending on what you are making.You can freeze cookie dough, too.

, Even if you're eating alone, eat at the dinner table. Get out the real dishes, the good ones, if you like. Light a candle. Settle in with a favorite book or some soft music, and really dine.

, Nobody likes to enter a messy kitchen and have to clean up before you can cook. If you'd like, collect the dishes in a dishpan or the dishwasher until you have enough to wash as a batch. But remember, pots and and pans are easiest to clean while still warm. Save yourself a pile of dishes by making a habit of cleaning a pan as soon as you remove the food.

Preheat the oven every time you bake.,
Get an oven thermometer.,
Keep the door closed while baking, as much as possible.,
Adjust cooking times.,
Rotate the food.,
Move your shelves around.,
Bake only one tray or pan at a time.,
Use an air-filled baking sheet or try glass or silicone bakeware.,
Use a heating stone.",How to Cook Food in a Bad Oven," Preheating gives the oven a head start, and it's necessary for most pastries to go into an oven that's already warm. If your oven seems to take longer to get started, give it more time. Turn the oven on before starting to mix things like quick breads and muffins. Ten or fifteen minutes will let even a tired oven get up to speed.;
, If setting the temperature doesn't produce that temperature, you may be able to adjust so that the resulting temperature is correct, or at least closer to where it should be. You can also see exactly how long it takes the oven to preheat, so you can plan accordingly. Do not use a ""stick"" thermometer, these are made for making contact with meats and other foods directly. You should put the oven thermometer into the oven at the same time you start preheating, and once it is finished preheating wait another 1-2 minutes for a more accurate reading.

, Make sure that your oven has a chance to do its job. Opening the door of any oven, working or not, drops the temperature dramatically.


Some foods are more sensitive to having the door opened than others. Casseroles and roasts will probably be just fine; cookies may take a bit longer if ""checked"" too often. Things like souffles, popovers, and other such pastries will almost certainly fail from having the door opened at all.

, If things are coming out consistently over- or underdone, try baking them for more or less time. Use a timer and learn how long things take in your oven as compared to what's given in the recipe. You may have to adjust the cooking times and the temperatures concurrently to get things to come out right.

, If you notice that the top or bottom, front or back of the food is scorched, move it around so as to distribute the heat more evenly. Partway through the baking, switch things from a high shelf to a low shelf and rotate it front to back if it helps.

, Most oven shelves will pull out if you lift them past their stops. Ovens generally heat only from the bottom unless they are set to broil, so try to center the food in the oven and keep it up and away from the heating elements.

, Having one large tray of cookies on the lower shelf may very well mean that no heat reaches the thing on the top shelf. If you can place two smaller pans side-by-side on one shelf, go ahead, perhaps swapping their locations and turning them mid-way.

, Different materials conduct heat differently than straight metal, so they may help the bottom not to scorch. For things like roasts, put the roast up on a rack, and wrap it or cover it in foil.

, Place an unglazed ceramic tile or clay bricks into the bottom of your oven. Earthenware, once heated, more evenly disperses heat throughout the oven. This will cause the oven to cook more evenly.

Choose fresh cilantro.,
Rinse the cilantro in a bowl of water.,
Shake the water off the cilantro.,
Pat the cilantro dry with a few paper towels.,
Consider blanching the cilantro.",How to Freeze Cilantro1," Cilantro will wilt a little when you freeze it, so it is important to buy cilantro that is fresh. Look for crisp, bright green leaves. Avoid anything that looks wilted, crushed, or yellowed., Hold the cilantro by the stems and swish it in a bowl of cool water. Keep doing this until the water becomes dirty. Repeat the process with fresh water each time until the water is clear. You may need to two to three water changes

, Hold it by the stems, and give it a few, good shakes. It might be a good idea to do this over a sink, so that your kitchen does not become all wet.

, Place a few paper towels down on a flat surface, then set the cilantro down on top of them. Cover the cilantro with another paper towel and gently press down on it. The paper towels will absorb any excess moisture. Keep doing this with fresh, dry paper towels until there is no water left., You can do this by dipping the cilantro into a pot of boiling water for 15 to 30 seconds, then dunking them under ice cold water for a few more seconds. Do not leave the cilantro in the hot water for more than 30 seconds, and be sure to dry it off well. Blanching the cilantro will help preserve the vibrant color."

Squeeze out as much air as possible before sealing the bag.,
Use a permanent marker to write the date on the bag.,
Place the bagged cilantro into the freezer.",How to Freeze Cilantro2," If you want to freeze just the leaves, you will need to pinch them off, and discard the stems. You can also freeze the cilantro whole, and break off a few leaves whenever you need them.

, This will protect the delicate herb from the cold and keep it from going mushy.Simply place the herb into a bowl and toss it with a teaspoon to a tablespoon of olive oil. How much olive oil you use will depend on how much cilantro you are freezing; the more cilantro you have, the more oil you will need.

, Try to keep the cilantro spread out evenly in the bag. If you are using whole cilantro, try to keep the stems and leaves as straight as possible. You may need to use more than one bag.


If you do not have any freezer bags, use regular re-sealable bags instead, one inside the other.

, Zip the bag close part way, then gently press down on the bag with your hands until it is flat. Close the bag the rest of the way. Be careful not to crush the cilantro.

, If you are storing other types of herbs in the freezer, it might be a good idea to write down ""Cilantro"" on the bag as well., Try to place it so that the herbs are laying down flat and straight.

, If you do not have a blender, you can use a food processor instead.

, If you want a more intense cilantro flavor, increase the cilantro to 2 cups (100 grams).Also, if the strong flavor of olive oil bothers you, try using another cooking oil, such as canola or vegetable.

, Make sure that the lid is secure and that there are no leaks. Keep blending until the oil turns green and the cilantro has broken up into smaller pieces. Do not blend it for too long; you still want to see bits of the herb.

, Fill each well about 3/4 of the way. Do not fill it all the way; the puree will expand when it freezes.

, Set it down on a flat, stable surface. Leave it there for a few hours to overnight.

, This way, you will be able to reuse your ice cube tray. If you do not have any freezer bags, use two regular bags instead, one inside the other.

Finished.

",How to Freeze Cilantro5," If you froze cilantro just on its own, without any butter or oil, you can break off a few leaves, and add it to guacamole or cilantro chutney. You do not need to defrost it., You can also use it in salad dressings. Because it already contains oil, you will need to adjust your recipe and use less oil. A single cube of frozen cilantro will contain about a tablespoon of oil.

, It will take about 15 to 20 minutes for it to thaw.Once it thaws, you can spread it on bread or crackers.

, Once frozen, cilantro loses some of its crispness. When it becomes defrosted, it will appear wilted and mushy. This may detract from the appearance (and texture) of salsa and salad., Once frozen cilantro starts to thaw, it will begin to look wilted and mushy. If you need to garnish something, consider using fresh cilantro instead.

, Frozen cilantro won't last forever, although it will certainly last longer than fresh cilantro. Here are some guidelines as to by when you should use your cilantro:


Use frozen cilantro within two months.
Use cilantro frozen in oil within three months.
Use frozen cilantro butter within a month. If you thaw it and put it in the fridge, use it within five days.

Select very fresh, and very cold eggs.,
Separate the eggs.,
Allow the egg whites to warm to room temperature.,
Place the egg white(s) in a straight sided mixing bowl.,
Beat the whites until they have the right consistency.,
Put about a third of the whipped egg white into the batter.,
Fold the egg whites into the batter.,
Don't stir the egg whites into the batter.,
Finished.",How to Fold in Egg Whites," Choose large or extra large eggs to make separating them easier. The best results are obtained with very fresh eggs, since the protein ""strings"" that cause the stiffening of the whites break down over time.;
, When doing this you must be careful not to get any yolk or shell pieces mixed in with the whites of the eggs. There are several ways to separate an egg:


Method One: Carefully break the eggshell in half, and hold it over a bowl to allow the egg white to pour out slowly while the yolk remains in the shell.
Method Two: Place the entire egg into a shallow bowl and pour off the white without breaking the yolk. It helps to hold the yolk back from the edge of a bowl with a spoon. Either method requires practice.
Method Three: Hold a slotted spoon over a bowl. Crack the egg open and then pour the yolk and white through the slotted spoon. The spoon will allow the whites to go through and down into the bowl, while the yolk will remain in the spoon.
Method Four: Put the egg in a bowl. Find a plastic bottle with a wider mouth. Now pinch the bottle so that it crinkles, and place it over the egg yolk. Let the pressure on the bottle release, and the yolk should be sucked up into the bottle.

, You can save the yolks for another recipe, such as homemade mayonnaise, or you can use them later if the recipe calls for that.

, Mix the egg whites at medium high or high speed with an electric mixer. Keep the mixer moving around the inside perimeter of the bowl so all the contents are mixed equally and thoroughly.

, Properly beaten egg whites will be uniformly white and will be rather stiff. They should also form soft peaks and be light and fluffy looking. This is a critical step.Some cookbooks recommend adding a small amount, usually less than 1/4 teaspoon, of Cream of Tartar to help with the beating. The cream helps make the egg whites fluffier.

, Gently mix this small amount of egg whites into the batter. Doing this is called ‘tempering’ the batter and helps with when mixing in the rest of the egg whites. Only stir the egg whites into the batter until the batter looks barely combined and slightly clumpy.


Make sure all other ingredients are thoroughly mixed according to the recipe you are using before adding the egg whites.

, Using a large spatula, cut a path down the middle of the mixture with the edge of the spatula. Gently turn half the mixture over onto the other half. Continue cutting down the middle and turning a portion over.This will work even better if you use a large metal spoon or a palette knife to ""cut"" the egg whites into the mixture.

, The purpose of folding is to retain the air you have beaten into the whites. Be careful to only work the batter enough to incorporate the whites, and never use an electric mixer for this step., The finished mixture should still look a little lumpy but no egg whites should actually be showing.

",How to Cook an Omelette1," Eggs cook quickly, so it is best to select and cut up all of your ingredients prior to cooking. First gather the number of eggs you want to cook; most omelettes have 2-4. Next chop your filling into bite-sized pieces and shred some cheese.


Some common omelette additions include onions, ham, bell peppers, green onions, spinach, sausage, olives, diced tomatoes, carrots and mushrooms. Use any or all of the ingredients, in a combination of your choice.






You can use cheddar cheese, swiss cheese, goat cheese, feta or any other type you like.

, Crack the eggs one at a time into a bowl. After breaking the eggs, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly to prevent salmonella poisoning.








, You can either use a fork or wire whisk to beat the eggs. At this stage you can add salt, pepper, and other herbs and spices to the eggs as well.








, Heat some butter in the skillet over medium heat. Pour on the eggs, spreading them evenly with a spatula. Adding a splash of milk or water will help make the eggs a tad fluffy.








, While the eggs are firm on the bottom, but still slightly runny on top, sprinkle all of the fillings except for the cheese over the eggs. Continue cooking the omelette until the eggs bubble on top.








, Use a spatula to gently flip the omelette to the other side. Keep cooking for another minute or two, until the omelette is no longer runny.








, Sprinkle the cheese into the center of the omelette, then use the spatula to gently fold the omelette in half over the cheese. Roll your omelette onto a plate.

The temperature at which boiling occurs varies according to atmospheric pressure, but it is usually around 100°C (212°F). Boiling food involves immersing the food in boiling water until cooked.


Boiling is quite a violent cooking method, as the bubbles of vapor moving through the water can damage delicate food. As a result, it is a cooking method best reserved for only a few specific foods, such as dried pasta and boiled eggs.
Boiling vegetables in water used to be quite common, but nowadays people tend to avoid doing so as many water soluble vitamins can leak out of food during boiling, lessening their nutritional value. If you do cook vegetables by boiling, try to serve some of the cooking liquid as part of the dish in order to maintain nutritional value.

Poaching is the gentlest form of cooking in water, and is appropriate for cooking items like fish and eggs. It occurs at temperatures between 60°C and 90°C (140°F & 190°F).

Simmering is probably the most common method of cooking in liquid, and is used for most stews and sauces. It occurs between 87°C and 94°C (190°F & 200°F).

Slow boiling is the term used before water reaches a full rolling boil at 100°c. It is slightly more vigorous than a simmer, and occurs at 95°C.;
, Sautéing is a quick cooking method which involves cooking food in a pan, over a high heat, in a small amount of fat. It imparts a lot of flavor to food, and is perfect for cooking tender cuts of meat and chunks of vegetables.


It is very important that a high-quality pan is used for sautéing. A good pan will heat the food evenly and be very responsive to temperature changes. A heavy stainless steel pan, with a layer of aluminum in the core and heavy metal plating is ideal.
In terms of fat, oil or butter can be used. Olive oil or canola oil are most commonly used. Butter will impart great flavor to food, but will burn quicker than oil.
With sautéing, the most important rule is that both the pan and the fat be heated to a high temperature before adding the food. Otherwise, the food won't cook properly - it will absorb some of the fat and stick to the pan. To check if the pan is hot enough, a good tip is to add a couple of drops of water to the pan - if they sizzle vigorously and evaporate within a couple of seconds, the pan is hot enough.
Once the food is in the pan, it is important to keep it moving. The term sauté actually means ""jump"" in French, so keep tossing the food as you cook. This ensures that the food cooks evenly and that the pan stays hot. You will need room in the pan in order to toss food properly, so avoid overcrowding.
In terms of foods that can be sautéed, almost anything goes - with the exception of thick or tough cuts of meat (shank or brisket), entire roasts or chickens, or hard root vegetables. This is due to the fact that these types of foods will be burned on the outside long before they are cooked in the middle.
However, any small, tender cuts of meat will respond well to sautéing, along with the majority of vegetables. Just make sure that the food is chopped into equal-sized pieces, to ensure even cooking.
Some vegetables will cook quicker than others, even if they are cut to the same size - account for this by either chopping the harder vegetable into even smaller pieces, or by adding the faster-cooking vegetable to the pan at a later point., Frying is very similar to sautéing, in that the food is cooked in a hot pan with oil. As with sautéing, it is very important that both the pan and the oil are heated to the correct temperature before cooking. However, there are several differences between frying and sautéing, along with different forms of frying itself, so it is worth noting the differences between each.



Pan frying is very similar to sautéing. It involves cooking food in a pan, using oil. However, pan frying is typically used for larger pieces of meat - such as chicken breasts, steaks, pork chops and fillets of fish - which have not been cut into pieces. It is also done at a lower heat than sautéing, to ensure that the larger food items do not burn on the outside before they are cooked in the middle.

Shallow frying is the same as pan frying, except for the amount of oil used. With pan frying the pan is simply coated thinly with oil, whereas with shallow frying the oil typically reaches about halfway up the sides of the food being cooked. This method is used for cooking food such as fried chicken, battered shrimp and eggplant parmigiana.

Deep frying involves completely immersing the food in hot oil. With this type of frying, the food does not need to be flipped over halfway through cooking, as the coating of oil allows it to cook evenly on all sides. It is used to cook items such as battered foods, french fries and donuts.

Stir frying, a staple of Chinese cooking, is more or less the same as sautéing - the food is cut into small pieces and cooked in oil in a hot pan. The only difference is the type of pan used; stir frying is done in a wok - which has a deep bowl with gently sloping sides and is made from thin metal., Broiling and grilling are both dry cooking methods which involve heating food with an open flame. The only difference between broiling and grilling is that with broiling the heat source is above the food, whereas with grilling the heat comes from below.


With grilling and broiling, the food is cooked by the hot air produced by an open flame. However, air is actually a poor conductor of heat, so the food needs to be placed quite close to the heat source. This means that the food cooks quickly on the outside, making grilling or broiling a good option for tender cuts of meat, chicken and fish.
Due to the hot and dry nature of this cooking method, a lot of foods will be marinated before cooking to ensure that they stay moist and flavorful. Marinating means soaking food in a seasoned (and often acidic) liquid before cooking. It is done in order to tenderize meat and add flavor to various foods.
The food is usually placed on some kind of grid or grate, which allows the fat to drip off and produces the distinctive, striped grill-marks that this cooking method is known for.
The food will need to be turned or flipped over once during grilling/broiling to ensure it is evenly cooked on both sides. Other than that, the food should not be moved during cooking.

Barbecuing is almost the same as grilling, except that the flame is produced by burning wood or coal, giving food a distinctive smoky flavor., Microwaving is a very convenient cooking method which requires little skill. The microwave works using electromagnetic waves which cause water molecules in food to vibrate. This vibration produces heat which then cooks the food.Although most cooking novices will at least be familiar with the microwave, there are a few health and safety features you should be aware of:



Never put metal cookware in the microwave. The electromagnetic waves will not be able to penetrate the metal and may produce electrical sparks that can damage your microwave. The same thing goes for aluminum foil.
Any foods that have skins - such as potatoes and hot dogs - should be pierced with a fork before cooking. Otherwise, steam pressure will build up inside the food, causing it to explode inside the microwave.
Food should always be covered with a microwave safe lid during cooking - this will prevent splattering and help the food to heat evenly.
Sometimes there may be ""cold spots"" in the microwave, which prevent the food from cooking evenly. To avoid this, you should move the food around during cooking - pausing the microwave to stir sauces, flip over meat, or rearrange vegetables.Contrary to popular belief, microwaving food does not cause a significant loss of nutrients.However, many people still choose to abstain from using the microwaves for cooking, using it only for reheating, defrosting or making microwave popcorn.
However, if you are in a rush, most recipes can be adapted to use the microwave instead of more traditional cooking methods.

, Roasting is a dry heat cooking method, which involves cooking food, uncovered, on a roasting pan in the oven. It is most often associated with large cuts of meat - whole chickens and turkeys, lean cuts of pork, lamb and beef, fillets of fish - but also works very well with vegetables.


With roasting, the main focus should be on the flavor of the food itself - not on sauces or accompaniments, like in a stew or braise. The outside of the meat or vegetables should turn golden brown throughout cooking, while the insides remain moist.
A good roasting pan should be used, which is placed on the middle shelf of the oven. Convection ovens are perfect for roasting in, as they allow hot air to circulate, resulting in evenly browned meat and vegetables.When roasting meat, many cooks believe that the meat should be suspended slightly above the bottom of the pan, to prevent it from cooking in its own juices. A roasting rack can be used for this purpose, or the meat can be placed on top of a pile of vegetables, serving the same purpose but also adding flavor.
Food should never be covered when roasting. If the food is covered, it will cook in its own steam rather than the dry heat of the oven. However, you don't want the meat to dry out either, so leaner cuts of meat may need to be basted throughout cooking. Basting involves coating the outside of the meat with butter, oil, pan drippings or some form of sauce during cooking.
The best way to tell if a meat has been roasted to perfection is to use an instant-read thermometer to check the internal temperature of the meat. Each type of meat has an ideal internal temperature, which should be indicated on whatever recipe you are following.When roasted meat is taken out of the oven, it should be allowed to rest for a few minutes before carving. This allows it to finish cooking and ""relax"" slightly, making it easier to slice.

, Steaming is a moist heat cooking method, which uses the heat from steam to cook food. It is a very gentle form of cooking, making it a great option for delicate foods such as fish and vegetables.


Water changes state as it boils, converting from liquid to vapor. This means that steaming occurs at the boiling point of water - 212°F at sea level. Despite such high temperatures, steaming is one of the most gentle forms of cooking as the food is not agitated by bubbling water.
Steaming is also a very healthy form of cooking, as unlike boiling, simmering, etc., the steam does not leach nutrients from the food. As a result, steaming food may preserve up to 50% more nutrients than other forms of cooking. In addition, steamed food does not require any form of fat to be added as a cooking aid, which cuts down the calorie content of the food.Steaming can be done using a traditional stacked bamboo or plastic steamer on the stovetop, but it is also possible to steam food by simply boiling water in a pot and balancing a roasting rack or colander on top to hold the food. Steamer inserts (which fit onto most pots) are also available at most kitchenware stores.
Although water is normally used for steaming vegetables, it is possible to use other liquids when cooking fish and white poultry in order to add flavor. Chicken, beef and vegetable stocks, fruit juices and wine can all make flavorful substitutes, and any combination of herbs and spices can be added to the cooking liquid. Then, as the steam rises, the flavors from the cooking liquid will permeate through the food.Steaming is a relatively fast cooking method, since it is conducted at such a high temperature. Most vegetables will cook in under 5 minutes, while fish and other white meats will take between 3 and 5 minutes, depending on thickness.

, Braising is a moist cooking method which can turn large, tough cuts of meat into a juicy, tender dish. It is achieved by first searing the meat (or tough vegetables) in a pan with fat, and then slow cooking it in liquid for several hours.


Braising is a great option if you're looking for a cheap, tasty dish which can feed a whole family. The braising process is easy enough, but it can take several hours for the food to achieve the right consistency, so it is not something that can be done in a hurry. However, the food requires very little attention during this time, so it's possible to just leave it cooking in the oven while you go about your day.
To braise, you first need to sear the meat in fat in a hot pan. This browns the outside of the meat, giving it flavor and making it more visually appealing. The meat is then placed in a heavy, oven-proof dish, a dutch oven, or a slow cooker. You will need to de-glaze the pan using wine, broth or some other liquid in order to scrape of small pieces of meat or fat that may have escaped. Add this liquid to the meat dish, along with the rest of the cooking liquid (usually some combination of stock, wine or fruit juice) which should reach about halfway up the meat. Cover the dish and place in a preheated oven (or turn on the slow cooker) and leave to cook for up to six hours, depending on the type of meat used.
Braising works best when the meat is cooked steadily at relatively low temperatures (around 150°C / 300°F) for long periods of time. Although braising can be done on the stove top, it is best done in the oven where the heat can surround the pot from all sides, thus ensuring even cooking.Braising works to tenderize meat using several processes. First, the heat breaks down the connective tissues that hold the meat together, turning them into collagen. Next, with heat, moisture and more time, the collagen turns into gelatin which eventually dissolves into the cooking liquid. While this is happening, the muscle fibers of the meat are squeezing moisture and flavor into the cooking liquid. But as time goes on, the muscle fibers will eventually relax and reabsorb moisture from the cooking liquid, leaving the meat tender and the sauce full of flavor.
The best cuts of meat to braise with include: top blade roasts, chuck eye roasts, seven bone roasts, ribs, brisket and shanks. These cuts are tougher and more fatty. Leaner cuts of meat have less connective tissue to break down, so braising them is a waste. It is also possible to braise chicken bones and thighs and large, firm fish.
In terms of vegetables suitable for braising, you should also go for tougher, more fibrous options such as celery, parsnip, squash, leeks, carrots, cabbage and beets., Baking is a dry heat cooking method, which is almost the same as roasting. The major difference is that roasting tends to be done at higher heats than baking, and baking is usually associated with food items that require batters and doughs, such as bread, cookies, pies and muffins. Here are some things to remember when you bake:


Avoid over-mixing doughs and batters. One of the most common mistakes people make when baking is over-mixing doughs and batters. Over-mixing activates the gluten in flour, which makes baked goods firm and chewy rather than light and crumbly. To avoid this, mix batters using the lowest speed on your mixer or fold them gently by hand, until just combined. Don't worry if there are still a few lumps remaining - this won't affect the final result. Doughs should be mixed or kneaded a little as possible - there should still be streaks of flour and chunks of butter visible in the dough.Avoid using cold eggs and dairy products when baking. Cold eggs and dairy products don't bond well, which prevents air from becoming trapped in the mixture. This can result in dense, flat cakes and muffins, To avoid this, you should always remove eggs and dairy products from the refrigerator 30 minutes to an hour before baking, allowing them to reach room temperature. If you forget, warm up the eggs in a bowl of warm water and cut butter into small chunks and microwave for ten seconds.Don’t use liquid measuring cups to measure dry ingredients. Another common mistake people make when baking is using liquid measuring cups to measure dry ingredients, like flour. When using a liquid measuring cup to measure flour, you will need to press or tap the cup to level the flour and read the measurement. However this compacts the flour, giving you more than the recipe calls for, leading to tough, dry cakes and muffins. To avoid this, use a dry measurement cup with a flat top, which allows you to spoon the flour into the cup, then level it off with a knife.For more specific baking recipes see: Bake Cookies, Bake a Cake, Make Pie Crust, Bake Muffins and Bake Bread. Also see: Bake Potatoes, Bake Fish, Make Pizza and Bake Chicken Breast.

, There are a large number of very specific cooking terms that you will come across when reading recipes. It is important to understand what these cooking terms mean. Definitions of some of the most common cooking terms are provided below:


Whip: Whipping a mixture means to beat it vigorously using a wire whisk or electric mixer in order to incorporate air and increase volume.







Zest: Zest is the colored outer skin of a citrus fruit. Therefore, in order to ""zest"" something, you need to remove this outer layer. This is done using a grater or fruit zester, which is rubbed over the sides of the fruit. When zesting, you should avoid the white layer of skin beneath the zest, as this can be bitter.







Knead: This is the term used to describe the pressing and folding of dough with the heels of your hands. Kneading develops the gluten in flour, allowing the dough to become smooth and elastic. This technique is used for bread doughs, and sometimes for scone and pastry doughs.







Fold: Folding is a method of gently mixing ingredients (like a cake batter) to ensure that the volume is not reduced. Is is best done in a bowl with a rubber spatula. The spatula is used to cut through the center of the mixture, bringing mixture from the bottom of the bowl to the surface. The bowl should be rotated as you fold, to ensure a uniform mixture.







Whisk: Whisking involves stirring or mixing ingredients using a wire whisk or fork. It allows air into the mixture, making it nice and light. It is not as vigorous an action as whipping.







Steep: Steeping means to submerge a food in water that's been heated to just below boiling point, allowing flavors and colors to emerge.







Score: Scoring something involves making shallow cuts on the surface of a food, usually in a diamond-shaped pattern. This is done to tenderize food, allow fat to escape, allow flavors to seep in, or simply for decoration.







Cook al dente: The term al dente means ""to the tooth"" in Italian and is used to describe pasta that has been cooked until tender, but still offers slight resistance when bitten into. It is how pasta should be cooked.







Reduce: To reduce a sauce means to boil it quickly so that some of it evaporates, thus decreasing the overall volume. The sauce that's left behind, which is thicker and has a more intense flavor, is known as a reduction.







Grease: To grease means to coat a pan or baking tray in a layer of butter or oil before cooking in order to stop the food from sticking.







Blanch: Blanching means to place fruit, vegetables or nuts in boiling water to partially cook them and to intensify flavor and color. They are then plunged into cold water to stop the cooking. Blanching can also help to remove the skins from items like tomatoes and almonds.







Baste: Basting involves rubbing a food with fat or other liquid during cooking to add moisture and flavor. It can be done using a basting brush or bulb., This is optional, of course, but is the recommended route if you're learning how to cook. First, have a general idea of what it is you'd like to cook, then consult different cookbooks and online recipes to get an idea of the different variations on that dish.


Read through the ingredients and instructions carefully before you choose, in order to get a sense of the flavors and skills involved. This is important, as some recipes don't break things down well for beginners, and some just aren't good.
Get recipes from friends and family for dishes that you've tried (and loved). The benefit of doing this is that if you don't understand something in the recipe, you can call them and ask!
If you look online, choose recipes that have received good reviews or comments. Look for dishes that you have tried previously (perhaps, made by a friend, or when eating at a restaurant) so that you may be able to appreciate the flavor to judge the finer nuances of the dish.
As you get better at cooking, you'll experiment and make some discoveries of your own. You'll know you're officially a good cook when people start asking ""How did you make this? It's delicious!"" Keep your cooking skills sharp by experimenting with new ingredients and techniques and by keeping note of the discoveries you make in your very own recipe book.

, Once you have decided on a recipe, it's time to start gathering the ingredients. Some you might have in your kitchen already - like spices, herbs, canned tomatoes and stock cubes - but others will require a trip to the grocery store.


Stay away from pre-prepared or frozen food products when shopping for ingredients, as these can add a great deal of fat, sugar, sodium and calories to your dishes. Opt instead for basic, natural ingredients which enable you to control the amount of fat, sugar and salt in your food. It might be slightly more work, but both the taste and nutritional value of the food you produce will improve greatly.
When shopping for fresh produce, be certain to take the time to ensure that the texture, colors, and quality of the food you buy is the best in the batch. Always buy the freshest, most high quality foods you can afford.This little touch can make the dining experience more robust and satisfying. You should also try to stick to cooking with foods that are currently in season, as that is when they taste their best.
If you're just starting to cook, don't substitute ingredients. The unfamiliar ingredient might interact with the other food in a way that you're not aware of and ruin the entire meal. When you become more experienced, you'll become better at predicting how a substitute ingredient will affect the cooking process and the final flavor.

, Your ""mise en place"" should be ready and close at hand before the stove is turned on.


Wash and clean the food. Most food needs to be cleaned somehow, and usually just rinsing with water will suffice. Foods that are peeled should be washed before peeling to decrease chance of transferring chemicals and dirt from unpeeled area to peeled area.
Cut the food into uniform slices or pieces so that they cook evenly. There are a wide variety of cutting techniques--chopping, dicing, cubing, slicing, julienning, etc. The bigger the pieces, the longer they'll take to cook. To complicate things further, some types of food cook faster than others; since zucchini cooks faster than carrot, for example, you might want to cut the carrot into smaller pieces if they're going to be thrown in at the same time so that they're both finished cooking simultaneously.Add salt, pepper, herbs, or marinade as called for in the recipe (or to taste). Any number of herbs or spices can be used to increase the flavor of whatever you are cooking. These may need to be added before or after cooking. Just be sure to add a little rather than too much. You can always add more later. Be especially careful with salt; it is very difficult to fix a dish that is too salty.
Ferment. This is NOT recommended for beginners. Fermentation (e.g. leavening) is a complicated technique that can result in wonderful baked goods, but it's the domain of experienced (or at least intermediate) cooks who understand how to control and direct this biological process. You need to be exact with baking (until you understand how each ingredient and method works, then you can switch around to your own tastes), especially since what goes in the oven can't be added to.

,


Heat the water. If your recipe requires poaching, simmering or boiling, get the water to whichever state the recipe calls for and keep it there. Don't place a lid on the pot if you're poaching or simmering because the heat may increase to a boil.Remove from heat if necessary if the water starts to get too hot.
Preheat the oven. Don't get impatient, or else you will most likely throw off your cooking times, since recipes are written assuming the oven is already preheated.It usually takes an oven about 15 minutes to get to 350°F or 176°C, but every stove is different. Some models will beep or make a noise when the temperature is reached; otherwise, you might need to use an oven-safe thermometer to determine when it has reached the correct temperature.
Heat the pan before adding oil. Heating the pan alone causes the metal to expand, opening up tiny scratches so that oil can get in there. Also, if you add oil to a pan that is already hot, it'll get hotter faster, giving it less time to break down. After you add the oil and cover the entire pan, wait for it to start smoking before adding the food. If you toss your food in before the oil has heated sufficiently, it'll soak up the oil rather than cook in it. , Seasoning your food with salt and pepper is the single, easiest but most important thing you can do to improve the taste of your food.


A dash of salt and pepper can really make the flavors of a dish come alive, bringing out the best in each individual ingredient.
If you're uncertain about quantities, or afraid of adding too much salt, the best thing you can do is taste! Add a little salt, taste, add a little more, taste...and so on, until the flavor is just right. It's how professional chefs do it.
The best types of salt to use are kosher salt for use during cooking, and sea salt for serving. The best type of pepper is freshly ground black pepper.
Sprinkle salt onto joints of meat or whole chicken before roasting, add a little to stews and sauces while cooking, and remember to generously salt the water when boiling pasta, rice and potatoes.
Be bold with your seasoning, and you'll never look back., Butter adds a delicious, creamy, slightly nutty flavor to food and should be featured heavily in all good cooking and baking.


Butter can be used as a cooking medium, like in sautéing, where it both complements and enhances the natural flavors. It can be used as the base for sauces, where it adds a wonderfully smooth, creamy texture. Or it can be used in baking, where it provides a wonderfully flaky, melt-in-your-mouth quality.
Where possible, use unsalted butter in your cooking. The only reason salt is added to most butters is to preserve their shelf life, but if you are using butter frequently this should not be an issue. Using unsalted butter ensures that there is no more salt added to the recipe than strictly necessary, which is especially important for baking as excess salt can lead to toughness.
The only drawback with using butter as a cooking medium is that it has a lower smoking point (130°C / 265° F) than other fats, such as olive or safflower oil, making it difficult to work with at high temperatures. For this reason, clarified butter (pure butter fat with milk solids and water removed) is sometimes used instead, as it is the milk solids that cause regular butter to smoke., A good sauce can transform a dull, flavorless dish into something much more exciting and delicious. By learning a few basic sauce recipes, you can kick your cooking credentials up a few notches, with very little effort.



Béchamel sauce: this is a white, creamy sauce which forms the basis of many dishes - including vegetable gratins, cheese soufflés and numerous pasta sauces.

Velouté : This is another simple sauce made by combining a roux with a flavored stock. Depending on the flavor of the stock, this sauce can be adapted to accompany chicken, fish or veal.

Marinara: Marinara is a bold, tomato sauce used in much Italian and Mediterranean cooking. It combines fresh or canned tomatoes, onions and a variety of herbs, and is used in many pizza and pasta sauces.

Hollandaise: This buttery, lemony sauce is the perfect accompaniment to seafood, eggs and vegetables. It is made by combining clarified butter, egg yolks and lemon juice to form an emulsion.
Other sauces you can experiment with include: Barbecue Sauce, Garlic Cream Sauce, Chili Sauce, Sweet and Sour Sauce, Cheese Sauce and Chocolate Sauce.

, Some of the most enjoyable dishes include a combination of different, yet complementary textures which work together to make eating a more enjoyable experience.


Think about topping off a baked pasta or vegetable dish, such as macaroni and cheese, or eggplant parmigiana, with some bread crumbs. The crunch of the breadcrumbs will provide a pleasant contrast to the softness of the other ingredients.
Similarly, adding some chopped scallions or celery to mashed potatoes can add a surprising, yet pleasant burst of texture and flavor to the dish.
Other ingredients which can add texture and interest to a variety of dishes include toasted nuts, such as pine nuts, cashew nuts and walnuts, crumbled cheeses such as feta, goats cheese and blue cheese, and items like water chestnuts, seeds and croutons.

, Herbs and spices can single-handedly give a dish a distinct flavor, characterizing it as belonging to Greek, Italian, Mexican, Chinese, or any other type of world cuisine. Herbs and spices enhance the flavor and color of food, making it more exciting to cook and eat. Some of the major herbs and spices are described below:



Basil: Basil is used most often in Mediterranean cooking and pairs perfectly with tomatoes. It can also be blended with pine nuts to make basil pesto.

Parsley: Parsley has a light, fresh flavor and is very popular in Western cooking. It works well in soups and sauces, or simply sprinkled over a dish to add a burst of color.

Cilantro: Cilantro is very popular is Asian and Latin cooking. Its raw leaves are used to add a fresh, bright flavor to cooked dishes, while it's roots are used for making Thai curry pastes.

Mint: Mint has a cooling flavor which makes it a great addition to summer salads and refreshing drinks (like Mojitos). It is also used in savory dishes originating from the Middle East and North Africa.

Rosemary: Rosemary is a strong flavored, woody herb which works well with roast chicken and joints of meat, stews and soups. It is best used sparingly.

Cinnamon: Cinnamon is a sweet, aromatic spice which is very popular in baking, especially in items such as apple pie and oatmeal cookies. It is also used in many Indian, Moroccan and Mexican dishes.

Paprika: Paprika lends a burst of bright red color and a spicy burst of flavor to food. It is used in many Hungarian dishes, while also being popular in Spanish and Portuguese cuisines.

Cumin: is a popular spice used mainly to add flavor and color to curries. It is used in Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Asian cooking.

Coriander: is a pleasantly sweet seed of the cilantro plant which has a lemony top note. It is commonly used in chili and curry dishes; it is used widely in many types of Latino, Middle Eastern, and Indian dishes.

Ginger: Ginger is a very versatile spice. When used fresh, it can add a sweet, yet spicy note to stir-fries, curries and roasted meats. In dried, ground form, ginger is often added to baked goods, such as ginger snaps.

, One of the most basic, yet most important cooking skills you need to learn on the road to becoming a great chef is how to scramble eggs. Basically, if you can learn how to perfectly scramble eggs, you can learn how to do anything. Knowing how to boil an egg is also a good skill.

, Rice accompanies a huge array of dishes, from a wide variety of cuisines, so it's important to know how to cook it right. Too mushy, too hard, stuck together - these are all common problems, but ones that can be easily fixed. The same goes for pasta.

, If you can roast a whole chicken, you are capable of making a meal to feed a whole family. If you can do it well, no-one will question your cooking skills ever again.

, A perfectly grilled steak is one of the simplest, tastiest foods you can make. Serve it with a fresh green salad and some french fries and you're good to go You can also try different sauces with it to make it more interesting and spice it up a bit!

, Steaming vegetables preserves their color and nutrients, making it the healthiest way to cook them. Perfectly steamed vegetables will add a burst of color and increase the nutritional values of any meal.

, Whether it's for someone's birthday, a bake sale, or just because, learning how to bake a delicious cake is a valuable life skill, and one you won't forget. Experiment with chocolate cake, vanilla cake, coffee cake, lemon drizzle cake and red velvet cake.

Heat a pat of butter in a small metal skillet.,
Beat and season the eggs.,
Pour the eggs into the pan.,
Flip the omelette.,
Slide the omelette onto a plate.",How to Cook an Omelette2," Place the skillet on a burner and turn the heat to medium high. Let the butter melt completely and make sure the pan gets very hot.


Don't use a nonstick skillet to make an omelette using this technique. The high heat can cause the nonstick coating to flake off.






This method works best with just 2 eggs, but you could add a third if you're quite hungry.







, While the butter is melting, put 2 or 3 eggs in a bowl and beat them with a whisk until the yolks and whites are combined. Using more eggs will create an omelette too thick to make with this technique; the egg mixture should spread thinly across the pan you are using. Season the eggs with a little salt and pepper, and sprinkle in chopped chives, oregano, dill, and other herbs to taste. 1/2 teaspoon of each seasons the eggs quite well.








, Be sure the pan is very hot first; the butter should be sizzling. As soon as the eggs hit the pan they will begin to bubble and cook. Stay close by, since the eggs cook very quickly when you use this technique. Cook the first side for 30 seconds.







, Pick up the pan and quickly move your wrist in a circular motion to flip the omelette to the other side. Be careful not to let the omelette flip out of the pan; use a controlled motion so that it stays centered.









This technique can take some practice. The pan should have enough butter so that the omelette easily slides across its surface and flips.
Use a spatula to turn the omelette over if you'd prefer not to chance flipping it.

, After the second side has cooked for about 20 seconds, slide the omelette onto a plate and use the lip of the pan to fold it over. This quick technique turns out simple, flavorful, perfectly cooked omelettes.

Cook the eggs until they are set.,
Remove the omelette from heat and cut into slices.",How to Cook an Omelette3," Beat the eggs, and mix in the carrot, onions, sesame oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir the combination well.

, If you have a bamboo steamer, use that to steam the omelette. If you don't have a steamer, create one using two pots, a large one and a smaller one that fits inside. Fill the larger pot with a few inches of water, and set the smaller pot on top. Put the pots on the stove and turn it to medium heat. Pour the eggs into the smaller pot and put a lid on top.

, Let the steam cook the eggs for about 10 minutes, or until the top is set. When you jiggle the steamer or the pan, the eggs will move slightly, but they should no longer look wet.

, Serve immediately.

Pour the mixture into a greased baking dish.,
Bake the omelette.,
Remove the omelette from the oven and serve.",How to Cook an Omelette4," Make sure it's fully hot before you cook the omelette.

, Beat the eggs in a bowl, then mix in the milk, cheese, ham, parsley, and salt and pepper.

, Baked eggs tend to stick, so use butter, oil or cooking spray to grease the baking dish you are using. Pour the egg mixture into the dish., Place the baking dish in the oven and bake the omelette until the top is set, about 45 minutes. When you move the pan, the eggs should shake slightly, but they should no longer look wet or runny.

, Cut the baked omelette into individual wedges for those you are serving. This baked omelette dish is delicious with toast or biscuits.

Gather your ingredients.,
Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan.,
Place the saucepan over a medium-high heat.,
Add the lemon or cream of tartar.,
Bring the sugar and water to a boil.,
Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 8 to 10 minutes.,
Do not stir.,
Watch the color.,
Know when the caramelization is complete.,
Stop the caramelization process.,
Use caramelized sugar on dessert immediately.",How to Caramelize Sugar1," To make caramel using the wet method, you will need two cups of white, granulated sugar, half a cup of water and a quarter teaspoon of lemon juice or cream of tartar.


If you only require a small amount of caramel, you can halve the quantities provided above: one cup of sugar, a quarter cup of water and 1/8 teaspoon of lemon juice or cream of tartar.
Depending on the desired thinness or thickness, your ratio of sugar to water will vary. The thinner you want the sauce, the more water you should add.;
, Use a quality metal saucepan with high sides and a thick bottom.









Cheap, thin-bottomed saucepans will often have hot spots that can burn the sugar and ruin your caramel.
It is also better to use a saucepan made from a light colored metal, such as stainless steel, as this will allow you to see whether the caramel is browning properly.

, Stir the mixture constantly with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula until the sugar begins to dissolve.









To turn sugar into caramel, it must first dissolve or melt, which occurs at approximately 320 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius).
At this point, the sugar syrup should be clear in color.

, Add the the lemon juice or cream of tartar (which you should dissolve in a little water first) to the sugar syrup. This will help to prevent the sugar from recrystallizing.







, As soon as the sugar has completely dissolved and the mixture begins to boil, you should stop stirring.








, You want the sugar syrup to be simmering, rather than boiling.









Cooking times will vary according to proportions of water to sugar, different stove tops and other factors.
Therefore, when you caramelize sugar it's best to use the color of the mixture as your guide.

, It's important that you avoid stirring the mixture as the water evaporates and the sugar begins to caramelize.









Stirring will only incorporate air into the mixture and reduce the temperature of the syrup. This can prevent the sugar from browning properly.
In addition, the hot caramel will simply stick to the spoon or spatula, and this can be very hard to clean off., The best way to gauge the progress of your caramel is to watch the color very closely. The mixture will turn from white to a light golden color to dark amber. This can happen very quickly so avoid leaving your pot unattended! Burnt caramel is inedible and have to be thrown away.









Don't worry if the dark amber color only seems to be developing in patches. All you need to do is gently lift the pot by the handle and swirl the contents to distribute the color.
It is also important to refrain from touching or tasting the caramel as it cooks. The caramel has usually reached a temperature of around 340°F at this point, and will burn the skin.

, Watch the mixture closely until it reaches a uniform rich, brown color. When the entire contents of the pot reach this even tone and are slightly thickened, you know the caramelizing process is done.


As soon as the caramel reaches the desired color, remove it from the heat immediately.
If you leave the caramel too long it will turn almost black in color and have a burnt, bitter smell. If this happens, you will need to begin again.

, If you want to ensure the cooking process stops and the sugar doesn't burn from the residual heat in the pot, place the bottom of the pot in ice water for approximately 10 seconds.









However, if you have taken the pot from the stove too early, you can just leave the caramel to sit for a minute and it will continue cooking.

, Use your caramel to top a flan, to make caramel candies or spun sugar, or simply drizzle it over ice cream!


Caramel hardens very quickly after it cools down. If you wait too long to use it on your dessert, it could be too stiff to pour or spread.
If this happens, simply place the saucepan back over a low heat and wait for the caramel to liquefy again. Swirl the pan rather than stir.

Boil a large pot of water.,
Soak the dandelions.,
Boil the greens.,
Sauté the remaining ingredients.,
Sauté the dandelion greens.,
Remove from the heat and serve.,
Roast the garlic.,
Toast the nuts.,
Prepare the dressing.,
Warm the greens.,
Serve the salad.,
Eat dandelion greens on a sandwich.,
Add them to lasagna and pastas.,
Stir fry them.,
Make them into pesto.",How to Cook Dandelion Greens," One way to help remove some of the bitterness from dandelion greens is to boil them first in water.Fill a large pot with water, add a teaspoon (5 g) of salt, and bring it to a boil.;
, As you wait for the water to boil, fill a large bowl with water and a teaspoon (5 g) of salt. Soak the greens for about 10 minutes, then drain them.

, When the water is boiling and the greens have soaked, boil them for three to four minutes, until they are tender. Drain the water and shock the greens by rinsing them with cold water until they are chilled. Set them aside in a colander or strainer.


Blanching will quickly lower the temperature of the dandelion greens to stop the cooking process and keep them from becoming soggy.Instead of discarding the water the dandelions boiled in, consider saving it for watering the garden., Pour the olive oil into a large frying pan and heat it on medium. When it’s hot, add the onion and red pepper flakes. Sauté for about five minutes, until the onion is tender.When the onion is ready, add in the garlic and sauté for another 30 seconds.
For an added zesty kick, consider adding a teaspoon (5 g) of fresh, minced ginger.To change the flavor of the dressing, try using walnut, sesame, coconut, or peanut oil instead of olive.

, Increase the heat of the frying pan to medium-high. When the pan is ready, add the greens and cook them for three to four minutes, until the water has evaporated.As they cook, use tongs or a fork to move them around in the pan.

, Season the greens with salt and pepper, to taste, and serve with a wedge of fresh lemon., This warm dandelion salad is dressed with a roasted garlic dressing and served with toasted nuts. Preheat the oven to 400 F (204 C). To roast the garlic:Peel off the outer layer of skin from a head of garlic, leaving all the cloves intact. With a good knife, cut the tips off the head of the cloves to expose the garlic underneath.
Place the garlic on a piece of aluminum foil and drizzle the whole head with a tablespoon (15 ml) of oil. Wrap the garlic in the foil, place it on a baking sheet or oven-safe dish and bake for 35 to 55 minutes.
When the garlic is done, the cloves inside will be golden and caramelized. Allow to cool for 15 minutes before popping the cloves out of the skins.

, Preheat your oven to 350 F (177 C). Spread the nuts out in a single layer on a baking sheet and bake for five to 10 minutes (five minutes for pine nuts, 10 minutes for almonds), flipping or stirring halfway through., Place all the cloves from the head of roasted garlic into a food processor or blender. Blend it until smooth, along with the oil, vinegar, lime juice, salt, and pepper., Heat a saucepan over medium heat. Add the dressing and warm it for about two minutes. Add the shallot and cook for another three to five minutes, until it’s soft.

, Arrange the dandelion greens in a large bowl and pour the dressing over them. Toss the salad until the greens are coated. Toss in the toasted nuts, season with pepper, and serve.


You can also make this salad with a variety of greens, such as spinach, arugula, endive, cabbage, frisée, kale and radicchio.When you add the nuts at the end, you can also sprinkle in a small handful of currants for an additional texture and flavor.If you picked your own dandelion greens from the garden for this salad, pick the flowers as well and use them to garnish the salad, as they are also edible., When you order a BLT at a restaurant, you’ve probably come to expect a soggy, tasteless lettuce wedged between juicy tomato and crispy bacon. But next time you're making your own lunch or snack, take a little more time with the lettuce portion and consider using dandelion greens instead of romaine or traditional iceberg lettuce. Dandelion greens can be used to spice up:


Sandwiches
Wraps
Tacos
Paninis

, Many pasta dishes, especially vegetable ones, come with greens and other vegetables, but more often than not the only green used is spinach. To change things up a little, consider replacing the spinach with dandelion greens next time you make:


Stuffed shells
Vegetable lasagna
Penne arrabbiata, which is a spicy sauce made with garlic, tomatoes, and red chilies

, Stir fries are an easy and tasty way to pack a whole lot of vegetables and nutrients into a single meal. Stir fries are often made with vegetables like broccoli, onions, mushrooms, peppers, and greens. Try adding dandelion greens to your next stir fry, but be sure to add them in the final minutes of cooking.

, Pesto is a sauce typically made from garlic, salt, pine nuts, basil, and cheese. All the ingredients get blended together to make a sauce or spread. Next time you're making pesto, consider substituting roasted pumpkin seeds for the pine nuts and dandelion greens for some or all of the basil."

Smash and peel the garlic cloves.,
Heat the olive oil in a skillet.,
Cook the garlic in the oil until it's golden.,
Remove the garlic from the pan, and use or store it.",How to Caramelize Garlic1," Take 5 to 6 cloves of garlic, and pound the side of a chef’s knife blade against them to smash them. Once the cloves are smashed, remove their skins and discard. Set the garlic aside for a moment.When you’re selecting your garlic, try to find cloves that are as large and thick as possible.;
, Place a large skillet on the stove, and add approximately ¼ inch (.63 cm) of olive oil to it. Turn the burner to medium, and allow the oil to heat for 3 to 5 minutes.You can reduce the oil to ⅛ inch if you prefer. However, keep in mind that by caramelizing the garlic in it, you’ll infuse the oil with the flavor so you can use it for pasta, salad dressings, and other dishes.

, When the oil has heated for several minutes, place the smashed garlic cloves in the skillet. Lower the heat to medium-low, and allow the garlic to cook until the edges have a golden color, which should take approximately 2 to 6 minutes.If the garlic looks like it’s turning brown, turn the heat down to low.

, When the garlic has caramelized, use a slotted spoon to remove it from the skillet. If you plan to use it right away, separate it from the oil. However, if you plan to store the garlic for later use, it’s a good idea to leave it in the oil because the oil will help preserve it.The garlic will keep for up to two weeks in the refrigerator.
If you’re separating the oil and garlic but want to save the oil for future use, pour it in a glass jar and store in the refrigerator.

Take care of the shells.,
Practice making the motion fluid.",How to Break an Egg with One Hand,"


You can also use golf balls.;
, Then squeeze the balls together to hold the quarter there. Your thumb, index and middle fingers should grasp one ball, while your other two fingers hold the other ball against the back of your hand. 








Once the positioning of your fingers is right, you can flip your hand over, holding the balls like an egg that you would crack.

, This motion should come from your first three fingers. Your pinkie and ring finger should be holding the back ball against your palm.









In order to start the motion, think about your thumb pushing away from your hand and taking the ball with it.

, Your thumb and first finger should be holding the small end, while your second and third fingers are pressing the other end against the heel of your palm.


You may want to practice on top of a bowl or other container, just in case pieces of shell do make it into the final product., Typically, you crack the egg against the top edge of the container you are about to put the contents into. You can also crack the egg against a flat surface, which some people find lessens the chance of the yolk breaking, and prevents eggshell surface bacteria from entering the contents.








Make sure the point of impact is between your thumb and first finger and the rest of the fingers.

, Hold the egg crack down above a pan or bowl. Separate the top half with your thumb, index and middle finger, while you hold the back half against your palm. The inside of the egg should drop out. If it doesn’t, tilt your hand and try to open the shells wider with your fingers.









Most people drop the egg yolk close to the pan or bowl, then pull it up rapidly as they continue to let it drop. This will help free the egg from the shell.

, If you are cracking many eggs, most people stack the top and bottom half of the shell and put it back in the container to discard later. Otherwise, you can throw them in a bowl or your sink. Remember that eggshells are also compostable!









If some shell dropped in after you cracked the egg, you can remove it with a fork after discarding the rest of your shells.

, Keep practicing until you can do it quickly. Try to do the steps faster and faster, until you can quickly crack the egg, separate the halves, and drop the yolk in one fluid motion.









Practice with your non-dominant hand as well. That way, you can break eggs two-handed!
Professional cooks often break eggs two at a time to cut preparation time from recipes, but you can do it to impress family members when you are making scrambled eggs.

Add sugar to a heavy-bottomed saucepan.,
Heat the sugar over a moderate heat.,
Deal with any lumps.,
Watch the color.,
Take the caramel off the heat.,
Finished.








",How to Caramelize Sugar2," Add an even layer of white granulated sugar to a light-colored, heavy-bottomed saucepan or skillet. As you heat the sugar, it will release its water and caramelize.









As this method requires no other ingredients, the exact quantity of sugar is unimportant.
Go for one or two cups, depending on how much caramel you need.

, Watch the caramel closely as it heats - it should begin to liquefy around the edges, turning from a clear liquid to a golden brown color.









As the sugar begins to brown, use a silicone spatula or a wooden spoon to move the liquefied sugar from the edges of the saucepan to the center.
This will ensure the sugar on the outside doesn't begin to burn before the sugar on the inside has melted.
If you have a very thick layer of sugar in the saucepan, be careful that the sugar at the bottom of the pan doesn't begin to burn before you realize.

, The sugar will probably melt unevenly, so don't worry if it looks lumpy in some parts, but is liquid in others. Just lower the heat and continue to stir. This will ensure that the caramel doesn't burn as you wait for the stubborn lumps to melt.









It doesn't matter if you can't get all of the lumps to melt - you can easily strain your caramel afterwards to remove them.
Be careful not to over stir the caramel either - if you do, the sugar may start to clump up before it has a chance to melt.
Don't worry though. If this happens, just turn the heat to very low and refrain from stirring until the sugar begins to melt again., Carefully watch the caramelizing sugar until it reaches exactly the right color - no more no less. Perfect caramelized sugar should be a dark, amber color - almost the color of an old copper penny.









You will know your caramel is finished when it is just past the smoking point. If you take it off before it smokes, it will be slightly undercooked.
You can also gauge if your caramel is done by the smell - it should be deep and rich smelling, with a slight nuttiness.

, Once your caramel hits perfection, don't waste any time in removing it from the heat. Caramel can go from perfect to burnt very quickly, and burnt caramel is bitter and unusable.









If you're using the caramel for a flan or crème caramel, you can pour the caramel directly from the saucepan into the molds.
If you're making spun sugar, it's important that you stop the caramelization process by dunking the bottom of the saucepan in ice water. Otherwise the residual heat from the saucepan could burn the caramel.
If you're making a caramel sauce, immediately add butter or cream to the caramel. This will stop the caramel from cooking and create a wonderfully creamy topping for ice creams and desserts. Just be careful, as the molten caramel can splatter when the dairy is added.

Preheat the oven.,
Peel and trim the garlic.,
Drizzle the garlic with the oil.,
Bake the garlic.,
Allow the garlic to cool, and serve or store.",How to Caramelize Garlic2," To ensure that your oven is hot enough to caramelize the garlic, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius), and make sure that the oven rack is set in the middle position.Keep an eye on the oven so you know when it’s fully preheated. Many models will beep or flash an indicator light to let you know that it’s reached the desired temperature.

, Leave the head of garlic intact, but peel away the outer papery layers from the bulb. Use a sharp knife to carefully trim away approximately ¼ inch (.63 cm) from the top of the head so the tops of the individual cloves are visible.When you’re peeling and trimming the garlic head, make sure that all the cloves remain connected to one another. You don’t want them to come loose.

, Once the garlic is peeled and trimmed, place it on a piece of foil. Next, drizzle approximately 1 to 2 teaspoons of olive oil over it to cover all of it.When you’re pouring the oil over the garlic, make sure that it sinks down into and between the individual cloves.

, Wrap the foil up over the garlic head, and place it on the middle rack of the oven to bake. After 40 minutes, unwrap it and check the garlic. The individual cloves be a deep golden color and soft when pierced with a knife. If the garlic isn’t fully caramelized yet, let it keep baking but check on it in 10 minute intervals until it’s done.The exact roasting time necessary to caramelize the garlic will depend on its size, age, and variety.
When you check on the garlic, be sure to use an oven mitt or pot holder because the foil will be very hot.

, When the garlic has finished baking, remove it from the oven, unwrap it, and allow it to cool for approximately five minutes. To remove the garlic from the paper, push on the bottom of the clove. You can use the caramelized garlic right away or store it in the refrigerator for later use.The garlic will last up to two weeks in the refrigerator. If you freeze it, it can last up to three months.

Determine if there is a commercial composting operation available in your area.,
Compost the fish remains using an underground compost setup.,
Add the fish remains to an enclosed composter.",How to Compost Fish Remains," Commercial composting (or ""industrial composting"") is a large-scale composting operation that usually serves an entire city or an even larger region. This type of setup generally helps to divert more food waste from landfills, as residents are more likely to drop off their scraps for pickup rather than maintain a compost pile of their own.


If there is a commercial composting service available in your area, you can likely dispose of meat and fish through that service. Because commercial setups are large, carefully controlled, and located away from residential areas, meat and fish are usually allowed into the compost pile. People are less likely to be bothered by odors and pests from these large composting setups.
Most commercial composting services perform street pickup for a fee, just like a city's sanitation service. If you live in a multi-unit building, you may be able to get other residents' agreement to share the fee or to convince the property owner to provide composting service.;
, Underground composting allows for the composting of fish because the buried remains will not produce an odor or attract pests.


To compost fish remains underground, dig a hole about 18 inches (45 cm) deep. Fill the hole with 6 inches (15 cm) of scraps, and then cover the scraps with 12 inches (30 cm) of soil.
Allow the compost to decompose in place for a full year. The compost can then either be dug up and used to condition soil elsewhere, or vegetation can be planted directly over the compost.

, If the above options are unavailable to you, you can add the fish to your regular composting setup if you proceed carefully.


To compost fish remains in an above-ground setting, you should always use a fully enclosed composter, such as a plastic tumbler-style model. Fish remains can be added in moderation to these compost piles, and the enclosure will prevent the intrusion of rodents and insects while helping to mitigate odors.
Fish scraps should not be added to open above-ground compost piles, even ones with enclosures made from poultry wire or wood slats.

Choose a digital thermometer.,
Try an “instant read pocket thermometer.” A common, effective, and relatively inexpensive option is an “instant read pocket thermometer.” These digital thermometers give an instant temperature reading by inserting a metal probe into the food.A good option is the Classic Super-Fast Thermapen for $79 (from ThermoWorks or Amazon).,
Experiment with “thermocouple readers” and probes.,
Consider an infrared thermometer.",How to Choose a Food Thermometer1," Non-digital ""dial"" thermometers—sometimes called bi-metallic stem thermometers—are no longer your best option. Over time, the metal on these instruments expands and contracts, causing the inner workings to shift and show an incorrect temperature.Instead, digital thermometers are easily the best choice. They are easy to read, remarkably accurate, and available in a wide variety of styles.There are many types of digital thermometers, ranging in price from as little as $5 to well over $100.
Instant read thermometers, infrared thermometers, and thermocouple readers are all available in digital models.;
,
A less expensive, but still great, option is the Super-Fast Pocket Thermometer (RT600C) for $19 (from ThermoWorks or Amazon).

, If you’d like something a little more high-end, you may prefer to use a thermocouple reader and probes. Thermocouple readers offer flexibility and accuracy by recording temperatures at multiple locations on the food, by way of thermocouple probes.A good choice for a reader is the Therma Differential Thermocouple Meter for $129 (from ThermoWorks).
The probes are sold separately. A good choice for these is the Stainless Steel K-Type Thermocouple Insertion Probe (set of 2) for $11.99 (on Amazon).

, An infrared thermometer can provide an accurate temperature reading without ever touching the food. Simply point the infrared gun at various points on your food to get temperature readings. This is a great option is you’d like to keep the look of your food intact.A good option is the Food Safety Infrared (IRFS) for $69 (from ThermoWorks or Amazon).

Choose a cutting board made of hard wood.,
Consider seasoning it with mineral oil before use.,
Practice good food safety.,
Wipe down your cutting board after use.,
Deodorize and spot-treat your cutting board once a week.",How to Clean Wooden Cutting Boards1," Cutting boards made of soft woods split more easily, and bacteria grow in the cuts a knife leaves behind. If you pick a cutting board made of a harder wood, like maple, walnut, or cherry, it will resist being cracked or nicked. This will keep it safe and looking good for a long time., Wood is a natural material, and when it loses moisture, it can dull--or, worst case scenario, split! Keep it sealed and seasoned with a light coating of mineral oil. Warm a small amount of oil in your hands, and then spread it on the surface of the cutting board. Let it sit for a few minutes, then wipe off with a clean rag or paper towel. Then flip over the cutting board and season the other side too.


You should season your cutting board about once a month, and every time you sanitize it.
Don’t use natural oils to seal the wood, because they can go bad. Mineral oil should do the trick.

, Because wooden cutting boards can’t be run through the dishwasher, many sources recommend not using them for high-risk foods. Whether you choose to use all-wooden, or a combination of wooden and plastic, cutting boards in your kitchen, it’s important to use different cutting boards for different foods.A plastic or well-seasoned wooden cutting board should be used for high-risk foods, including raw meat, poultry, seafood, and tofu.
A separate cutting board should be used for breads, cooked meats, cheese, fermented soy (like tempeh) and washed fruits and vegetables.
Both boards should be cleaned after use, and it’s important not to mix them up. Otherwise, you run the risk of cross-contamination., Every time you use your cutting board, rinse it with hot, soapy water, then with plain water. Dry with a rag or paper towel, or air-dry with the cutting board on its side. This exposes both sides of the cutting board to the air and allows gravity to drain excess water., When you’re tidying up your kitchen, you can also give your cutting board a more intense cleaning with some readily-available ingredients. This is especially helpful if you’ve noticed your board getting a little smelly or stained.


If you notice your cutting board is clinging on to the scents of strong foods, vinegar can help! Soak a paper towel in white vinegar, then wipe it across the surface of the cutting board. This will neutralize the odors without making the wood smell like vinegar in the long term.Another time-honored trick is sprinkling salt over the cutting board’s surface while it’s still wet. The salt draws out moisture trapped in the board’s cracks, along with any bacteria that might be hiding.Stains can be dealt with using science-fair volcano ingredients, too. Try sprinkling baking soda over the discolored area, then scrub the baking soda into the wood using half a lemon. Afterwards, wash and dry the board."

Season the garlic.,
Seal the garlic in foil with thyme.,
Cook the garlic in the slow cooker until caramelized.",How to Caramelize Garlic3," Take four heads of garlic that have been cut in half horizontally, and place them on a piece of foil. Drizzle 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil over the garlic halves, and sprinkle a pinch of a salt over them.You can omit the salt if you’re trying to limit sodium in your diet.

, Once the garlic halves are covered with the oil and salt, put them back together to form a full head. Tuck four sprigs of thyme among them, and fold the foil up around the garlic to create a sealed pouch.If you aren’t a fan of thyme, you can substitute rosemary or omit the herbs entirely.

, Place the foil pouch with the garlic inside your slow cooker. Turn the heat setting to low, and allow the garlic to cook until it is caramelized, which should take approximately six hours."

Try a “leave-in digital meat thermometer.” Leave-in thermometers are an excellent choice for slow cooking meat and poultry (as when roasting a turkey).,
Choose an “instant-read digital meat thermometer.” When it comes to instant read meat thermometers, there are two basic designs.,
Look for additional features.",How to Choose a Food Thermometer2," Simply insert a metal probe into your meat and leave it there while cooking. A digital display outside the oven conveys the temperature, by way of a thin cord or via Bluetooth.A good choice for this is the Chef's Digital Leave-In Meat Thermometer for $39.99 (from Oxo).

, One is wand with a bulb at the end. The other is a hinged, folding probe. The second design is a bit more expensive, but offers a more sophisticated probe with faster results.A great choice for a hinged instant-read digital thermometer is the Lavatools Thermowand for $28 (on Amazon).

, Different types of meat thermometers will offer additional features. Generally, the more features a thermometer has, the more expensive it will be. So consider whether or not any of these following features will be useful to you:Audible alarm/alert (that tells you when meat is ready).
Auto shut-off (to conserve battery when not in use).
Pre-set meat temperature (according to USDA guidelines).
Programmable timer (that you can set manually).
Back-light (this enables you to see the display in dark rooms or outdoors at night).

Assess how often you’ll use it.,
Determine what it will be used for.,
Decide on a budget.",How to Choose a Food Thermometer3," Food thermometers can range widely in price, from as low as $5 to as much as $150. The number one factor in how much you spend should be how often you cook. If you will be using the thermometer often, it is worth it to spend a little more., If you will be cooking a great deal of poultry or meat, a good quality thermometer is essential for food safety. If you will be cooking only vegetable dishes and baked goods, you can probably get away with a less expensive model., After considering how often you’ll use it and what it will be used for, you must finally consider how much money you have available to spend. All three of these factors taken together, will help you come up with a budget. Armed with this figure, you can best select the thermometer that suits your needs.

Sanitize your cutting board once a month.,
Make sure your cutting board is clean and dry.,
Create a cleaning solution.,
Disinfect the cutting board.,
Pour a little white vinegar onto a paper towel, then wipe the surface of the cutting board.,
Re-season the cutting board.",How to Clean Wooden Cutting Boards2," Even if you clean your cutting board after each use, it's important to give it a more intense treatment every once in a while. A bleach solution will kill more ingrained germs than simple soap and water can. This deep clean is especially important if you use your wooden cutting board for meat, poultry, or other high-risk foods.

, If it isn't, scrub it down with hot, soapy water, then rinse with a wet paper towel or rag. Pat dry with paper towels or a clean rag, or air-dry with the cutting board on its side. You don't want there to be any extra food on the board while you're trying to sanitize it.

, In a spray bottle, combine 1 teaspoon liquid bleach with one quart of water. Make sure the cap is firmly on the bottle, then give it a good shake to make sure the ingredients are evenly combined.If you don’t have an ammonium-based bleach, or are scared to use it near food, you can use hydrogen peroxide instead. A pre-mixed 3% solution works well., Use the spray bottle to distribute a thin layer of the solution over the cutting board’s surface. Allow it to sit for ten minutes or so, then rinse the cutting board’s surface under running water. Be careful not to get any of the bleach onto your clothes or kitchen surfaces. Shake off any excess water, then repeat on the other side.


If you’re using hydrogen peroxide instead of a bleach solution, pour a little onto a paper towel and carefully wipe it over the surface of the cutting board instead. Allow to sit, then rinse., This step is optional, but will get the board extra clean and deodorized. Afterwards, set the cutting board on its side to dry. , Bleach can dry out a natural material like wood, but a fresh coat of oil can help prevent this. Simply rub a small amount of mineral oil across the surface of the cutting board and let it soak in for a few minutes, then wipe up any excess with a rag or paper towel.

Buy organically.,
Research organic recipes.,
Most organic foods can still be used in standard recipes (after all, they had to cook this way in the past), but you need to know how they are made.,
A lot processed foods (eg crushed tomatoes) are time saving conveniences.,
Invest in a cook book that talks about food preparation (cheapest from charity stores or swap-meets / flea markets) or read how-to guides from the Food Preparation section in wikihow.

,
Many processed foods contain large amounts of salt, sugar or fats which improve the flavour.,
Making your own preserves and pickles is satisfying, cheap, and makes a good reliable backup as many off-the-shelf products are full of additives and chemical preservatives.,
Marinating food in herbs, spices, vinegars and flavoured oils are a great flavour enhancer if you find the ingredients become a little too similar in flavour.

,
Vary your cooking methods from steaming to include grilling, baking, smoking, braising (etc) to keep your meals varied and interesting.

,
Eat raw.",How to Cook With Unprocessed Food," This means means buying foods that don't have any pesticides in them. Look for the organic seal of approval or even just the word ""Organic"". Fruits and veggies should definitely be bought organically. Yet, some fruits and vegetables are higher in pesticides than others. Peaches, apples, sweet bell peppers, celery, nectarines, strawberries, cherries, lettuce, imported grapes, pears, spinach, and potatoes should all be purchased organically because of their high pesticide amounts. Onions, avocados, frozen sweet corn, pineapples, mangoes, frozen sweet peas, asparagus, kiwi, bananas, cabbage, broccoli, and eggplant don't have to be purchased organically due to their low pesticide amounts.;
, Try getting books on recipes using organic food. Some good books might include Moosewood Cookbook and Broccoli Forest Cookbook.

, If (for example) you need curry paste but can't find any organic grade, make your own from individual organic spices. It is usually a lot more fun, tastes far better and is great experience in learning how to cook and balance flavours.

, You can get around this using the raw ingredient and other tools such as food processors, blenders, down to the basic such as potato mashers, graters, knives, forks (etc.) to achieve the same product.

,, When making from scratch taste the food you cook and season to taste. If you find you need a higher amount of salt than you would prefer, start to wean yourself off it by reducing the salt content and removing the salt shaker from the table.

, Organic preserves are pretty hard to find, but often you can get them from community fundraisers or town fairs where members have home-made their own jams etc to sell. It doesn't always contain organic ingredients, but is a good cheap alternative as a home cook rarely has access to chemical preservatives.

,,, Almost any fruits or vegges can be eaten raw and are delightful in salads or on their own. You don't have to cook them. As organic foods often have a better flavour than their mass produced counterparts, enjoy their natural taste!

Choose food fried in healthy oil.,
Choose an oil with an appropriate smoke point.,
Understand the effect of temperature.,
Try oven fried food.,
Make sure the food is drained properly.,
Discard leftover oil.",How to Choose Healthier Fried Foods1," At its very base level, the healthiness of a fried food depends on the type of oil you use. Thus, you need to make sure you pick the healthiest oil possible. Healthier oils typically have less saturated fat and little to no trans fats, which is linked to heart disease and other health risks.Some healthy oils include:


Sunflower oil
Safflower oil
Olive oil (though this is only suitable for low-temperature frying)
Unhydrogenated coconut oil. This oil is high in saturated fats, but also contains lauric acid, which increases levels of ""good"" cholesterol.Avoid partially hydrogenated oil or oil with a lot of trans fats, such as palm oil or hydrogenated coconut oil. Coconut oil labels do not always give you the information you need, but avoid any that are liquid at room temperature or have any color other than clear (as a liquid) or white (as a solid).;
, Each oil has its own smoke point, the temperature when the oil starts to smoke. Smoking oil produces bitter, sometimes toxic fumes, and degrades its flavor, shelf life, and nutrients.Whenever possible, choose an oil with a smoke point lower than the temperature you plan to fry at.


Canola oil, clarified butter, and refined safflower, sunflower, or coconut oils all have high smoking points.Olive oil and most unrefined oils should only be used in low-temperature frying.
Refined oils have a higher smoking point than their unrefined counterparts. These tend to be less healthy than unrefined oils, unfortunately, but some refinement processes are less damaging than others.

, There is a common myth that low-temperature oil will make your food absorb more oil. Surprisingly, although these foods can taste greasier or soggier if they fail to develop a crisp exterior, they actually contain less fat than food fried at higher temperatures.This doesn't mean you should lower the temperature of all your fried dishes (since this has a major effect on taste and texture), but it does mean that recipes with longer, lower-temperature frying methods contain significantly less fat than standard fried recipes.


If you aren't following a recipe, it's generally best to preheat the oil between 365 to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (185 to 190 degrees Celsius), or wait until the oil is shimmering but not smoking.
Foods should be properly defrosted. For example, do not ever fry frozen food.
Try using a frying thermometer to gauge the temperature of your oil., Oven frying is done in the oven and uses much less oil than deep frying. Thus, oven fried food contains less saturated fat and usually has more nutritional value.


Bread your chosen food.
Coat a baking sheet or tray with a cooking oil.
Place your food in the oil and bake it until the bottom side is golden brown. You might have to check it every few minutes.
Flip the food and bake until the other side is golden brown., Some people tend to overlook the importance of draining fried food. Ultimately, by draining a fried food properly, you not only remove excess oil, but you improve the taste of the food.


Take the food out of the oven or fryer and place it in a metal colander over a plate.
Allow the food a couple minutes to drain properly before removing it from the colander.
Dab the fried food with a cotton paper towel or something similar to sop up any extra oil., Heat lowers oil's smoke point, the temperature at which beneficial fats start to break down, and the oil becomes more vulnerable to turning rancid.Because of this, it's a bad idea to reuse oil that's already been heated. Tip the contents of the pan or fryer into the trash can, then store the bottle of oil in a cool, dark place.

Read the manual from cover to cover.,
Allow only responsible persons to operate the blender.,
Know what cannot be blended.,
Cut food to fit the blender jar.Do not allow the food to stick out past the top of the jar.",How to Blend Food Safely1," A lot of errors with kitchen appliances happen because the owner failed to read the specific instructions accompanying the manual. Whenever it involves blades, high speed and the potential to explode, you owe it to yourself to read the manual.

Check for the required wattage.If the wattage is different from your house wattage, get the right adapter to transform it safely.
Check for specifics about the blades of your blender. Know how they work and what safety mechanisms it has, if any.;
, Children should not operate the blender until you consider them to be responsible enough to do so without injury.Even then, teach the child how to use the blender properly and to know all the safety issues.

Supervise all use of the blender by children. Do not allow children to use the blender alone.

, There are some foods that should not be blended because they may damage the blender blades or harm you. These include:


Hard spices, such as black peppercorns, nutmegs, cinnamon sticks:Blending these can cause pepper dust that will harm your breathing and eyes and the other two items can break or damage the blades. Use a spice grinder or a mortar and pestle instead.

Coffee beans:Blenders are not made to grind, which is the method required for coffee beans. Once ground, coffee can be added to the blender for milkshakes, etc.

Mashed potatoes:The blender won't be able to cope with the gluggy consistency of the potatoes and will make a mess, not a mash.

Rock hard frozen foods:This includes ice and hard frozen fruits, berries and vegetables, as they will damage the blades and may cause small missiles to explode out. Also, having only frozen food in the blender can cause ""cavitation"", an air pocket around the blades that prevents proper cutting.Thaw frozen foods halfway before blending and let ice cubes soften just a little first.

Ginger:Fresh ginger should be chopped by hand or ground using a mortar and pestle.

Boiling hot liquid:As will be explained below, never put boiling hot soup, drink, liquid into the jar. Always allow it to cool a little first (see below).

, Instead, cut the fresh food so that it fits into half the height of the jar."

Find the total amount of dietary fiber.,
Find the net carbs.,
Find the glycemic load of the meal.,
All done!",How to Calculate the Glycemic Load of Your Meal," In order to have accurate results you’ll need to know the amounts of each part of the meal. Throughout these instructions we’ll be using an example meal of:


1 cup instant oatmeal
1 medium sized golden delicious apple
7oz serving of plain Greek yogurt;
, Add the carbs of each item in the meal together. Example:


The oatmeal has 22 carbs
The apple has 16 carbs
The yogurt has 8 carbs
22 + 16 + 8 = 46 total carbs in the meal.

, Divide the number of carbs in each item by the total number of carbs in the meal. Example:


To figure out the percentage of carbs the oatmeal contributes take 22 (the oatmeal) and divide it by 46 (total carbs in the meal) to get 0.48. (Rounded to keep the math simple)
Then do the same thing with the rest of the items so:
Oatmeal - 22 / 46 = 0.48
Apple - 16 / 46 = 0.35
Yogurt - 8 / 46 = 0.17

, All of the numbers calculated in the last step should add up to be 1.00 (may be slightly off due to rounding, that’s okay) Example:


Oatmeal = 0.48
Apple = 0.35
Yogurt = 0.17
0.48 + 0.35 + 0.17 = 1.00

, This information can be found at http://www.glycemicindex.com simply type in the name of the item into the search bar on their front-page. Example:


Oatmeal: GI of 83
Apple: GI of 39
Yogurt: GI of 12

, Take the percentage we calculated in step 3 for each item and multiply it by the GI value of that item. Example:


Oatmeal: 0.48 * 83 = 39.84
Apple: 0.35 * 39 = 13.65
Yogurt: 0.17 * 12 = 2.04

, Add all the numbers you got in the previous step to get the overall value of the meal on the glycemic index. Example:


(Oatmeal) 39.84 + (Apple) 13.65 + (Yogurt) 2.04 = 55.53

, Add the dietary fiber of each item in the meal together. This information can be found on the nutrition label of most foods. Example:


The oatmeal has 4 grams of dietary fiber
The apple has 3 grams of dietary fiber
The yogurt has 0 grams of dietary fiber
4 + 3 + 0 = 7 total amount of dietary fiber in the meal.

, Take the total amount of carbs in the meal (found in step 2) and subtract the total amount of dietary fiber from the last step. Example:


46 (carbs) - 7 (fiber) = 39 (net carbs)

, Take the total glycemic value of the meal from step 7 and multiply it by the net carbs of the meal from the previous step and then divide your answer by 100. Example:


55.53 (GI value) * 39 (net carbs) = 2165.67
2165.67 / 100 = 21.66 (rounded)

, You now know the glycemic load of the meal. A glycemic load of under 10 is considered low and any glycemic load of over 20 is considered high. In our example the meal has a glycemic load of 21.66, which is considered high.

Eat fried vegetables.,
Consume fried lean meats.,
Think about the breading or batter.",How to Choose Healthier Fried Foods2," While frying a food necessarily decreases the healthiness of it, by picking a healthy fried food, you’ll help come to a compromise between health and tastiness. Thus, make a list of your favorite vegetables and consider eating fried versions of them. Try fried:


Eggplant
Okra
Green tomatoes, When you eat meat that is fried, make sure it is lean. Ultimately, eating fatty fried food hurts your health doubly since you’re consuming extra fats. Thus, make sure you pick the fried meat you eat carefully.


Think about eating fried poultry like chicken or turkey.
Try to choose fried meats that are unprocessed. For instance, chicken nuggets made with fillers are usually not very healthy.
Foods like corndogs are unhealthy because of the frying process, the batter, and the meat., Next to what you’re frying and the oil itself, the batter you choose to use has a big impact on the healthiness of the food. At the end of the day, picking a healthier batter can drastically improve the healthiness of your fried food.


Go for a lighter breading, if possible. The less breading or batter, the less oil it will absorb.
Use cornmeal or rice flour. This will decrease oil absorption.
Try a batter that has a leavener or carbonation. This will lessen the amount of oil the batter absorbs."

Make healthier fried chicken.,
Create oven-fried zucchini sticks.,
Oven-fry asparagus spears.,
Use a pan to fry healthier hash browns.",How to Choose Healthier Fried Foods3," Fortunately, many of your favorite dishes, like fried chicken, can be made healthier through a couple alterations to the recipe. To make healthier fried chicken:


Fix your favorite breading or batter the way you normally do. However, decrease the amount of batter on each piece of chicken, if possible.
Take your chicken pieces and dip them in egg.
Drop your chicken in a freezer bag with your batter.
Heat a skillet on medium high on your oven top.
Coat the bottom of the skillet to about an eighth of an inch with vegetable oil.
Fry your chicken pieces until they are golden brown., Oven-fried zucchini sticks are healthy because they’re not deep fried and because zucchini is a very healthy vegetable. In the end, they’re also a tasty and enjoyable snack for your whole family. To create oven-fried zucchini sticks:


Preheat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232 Celsius).
Mix together cornmeal, flour, salt, and pepper in a bowl or a freezer bag.
Take medium-sized slices of zucchini and dip them in egg white.
Drop your zucchini slices in the bowl or freezer bag with the cornmeal and flour mixture.
Generously coat a baking sheet or tray with cooking oil.
Place your zucchini slices on the tray, put them in the oven for 8 to 10 minutes, and then flip them. Cook for another 8 or 10 minutes and then remove them from the oven., This is a treat where you’ll take a healthy vegetable and fry it to create a delicious snack or side. What makes this an even healthier treat is that it uses the oven-fried approach, rather than the deep-fried approach. Thus, your asparagus and its batter will absorb less oil.


Turn the oven on to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232 Celsius).
Coat a cooking tray with vegetable oil.
Place 1/3 cup of low fat mayo, 2 scallions finely chopped, 2 tablespoons of miso, 1 teaspoon of chile-garlic sauce, and ½ teaspoon of sesame oil in a bowl and mix them together.
Put your asparagus on a dish and drizzle ½ of the mayo and miso mixture on top. Make sure each asparagus spear is coated with the mixture. Then, sprinkle panko crumbs onto the asparagus. Roll them around in it, to make sure they are coated with panko, too.
Place the asparagus spears on the oiled tray and cook them for 20 to 25 minutes. When they’re golden brown, serve them with the remaining mayo and miso mixture., Pan-fried hash browns make a wonderful alternative to fries because they absorb less oil. In addition, you can add a variety of ingredients to your hash browns to make them tastier and more nutritious. To make pan-fried hash browns:


Finely dice 1/4th of a medium onion and 1/4th of a medium red bell pepper.
Peel and shred 3 medium russet potatoes.
Put 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large cast iron skillet and turn the heat to medium-high. Add your onions and peppers. After 1 minute, put in your potatoes.
Add pepper and as little salt as you can.
After 3 to 5 minutes, begin to flip the hash browns.
Remove them when both sides are golden brown."

Keep fingers and hands out of a blender.,
Take care to keep dangling clothing or jewelry out of the way when blending.,
Do not put anything in the blender while it is in use.,
Use the blender only for a short blending time.This is especially important if your blender does not have a cut-off switch if the engine overloads (cheaper and older models may lack such an automatic cut-off).,
Remove the blender jar or jug from the blender base before taking the lid off any blended food.This ensures that you can't accidentally bump the blender into working mode, which could cause an accident.",How to Blend Food Safely2," Whenever the blender is set up for use, it is important to avoid putting your hands or fingers into the blender. The blades are very sharp and when they are moving, can cut your skin, muscles and bones with ease.

Never put your fingers or hands into the blender while it is plugged into the wall. Any small bump or knock on the start button can cause it to start, with severe injury a high possibility.
Never put your fingers or hands into a blender that is operating.

, Things that could get caught on the blades include necklaces, bracelets, long earrings, ties, scarves, etc. Hair can also get caught if dangled in, such as braids, ponytails, long and loose hair, etc. Pin back your hair and removed dangling clothes or jewelry., If you try to add food or liquid while blending, it might fly everywhere. It is dangerous to add spoons, spatulas or any other stirring item; these could splinter on the blades or stop the blades and cause the motor to overheat and explode., Blenders are designed for short use, not prolonged blending. If you need to blend a lot, give the blender a break in between each short blending spurt.,"
"
Let the food cool slightly.,
Fill the blender to no more than halfway.Ideally, one third to a half is optimal for blending foods and liquids, especially if warm.,
Remove the center part of the blender lid.This is known as the blender cap or stopper.If this doesn't exist on your blender's lid, lift up one corner of the blender's lid.Note that it is the creation of a vacuum that causes explosive hot food or liquid problems in a blender.,
Place the lid back on.,
Place a clean kitchen tea towel over the blender lid.Before adding it, fold it thickly and ensure that it covers the blender lid in its entirety.,
Hold onto the lid to ensure it remains in place securely.",How to Blend Food Safely3," A 5-minute wait can make all the difference between a food explosion or a fuss-free blend.,,, This time it will be without the feeder cap. Double check that it is in place securely.,, Blend only on the lowest speed possible. This speed can be gradually turned up as you blend and can see everything is staying safe."
"
Do not blend hot liquid.,
Transfer the slightly cooled hot liquid to the blender.,
Lift up one corner of the blender's lid.Unlike with food, it is not a good idea to remove the feeder cap when blender hot liquids.,
Put a clean, folded tea towel or small hand towel over the lid.Hold in place gently (so as to not close the slightly ajar lid) and blend on the lowest level possible.",How to Blend Food Safely4," This doesn't mean you cannot blend warm liquid; it does mean that you need to wait at least 5 minutes before transferring any hot liquid to the blender.A few minutes of waiting can mean all the difference between a safe blend and a scalding experience., Fill no more than halfway of the blender., The opened part should be opposite to where you are.

Note that it is the creation of a vacuum that causes explosive hot food or liquid problems in a blender., Blend just a few times to start with, and gradually build up the blending when you can see it is working well and safely."
"
Prepare the hard or frozen foods appropriately.,
Ensure a good balance of liquid and hard or frozen food.The liquid is essential to ensure that the hard or frozen food is not grating against the blades.,
Place hard foods in last.,
Use a commercial blender if frequently blending hard frozen ice or hard or fully frozen food pieces.",How to Blend Food Safely5," Cut or break hard foods into small chunks or portions, as much as possible. Thaw frozen foods halfway before blending.Let ice cubes soften just a little first. Doing this will help the blender to cope with the foods without damage.,, Add the hard food second if you are blending with soft foods.In other words, add liquids, creams, custards and fresh vegetables, fruits and berries before adding the hard or semi-frozen foods. Do not fill more than halfway., Only a commercial grade blender can handle such hard foods safely and without damaging the blades when used daily.Or, a really high end, expensive consumer blender with a powerful motor (1000 watts) is needed.If you need to use ice cubes, allow them to soften a little first for an ordinary blender or the blades will wear out quickly if used often with hard ice cubes.Cheap blenders tend to be unable to cope well with frequent blending of such foods as nuts, raw carrots and raw broccoli.Cooked or semi-cooked vegetables are usually find, and if you crush the nuts first, a cheaper blender can probably cope.
Always read the instruction manual of your blender. If it states clearly that it can be used to crush ice or frozen foods, then it is probably okay. If it either warns against this or fails to mention it, assume that it is not a good idea to use the blender for hard or frozen foods.

"
"
Store the blender properly.",How to Blend Food Safely6," There are several important aspects to proper storage of the blender appliance:

Unplug the blender when it is not in use.There is no need to leave a blender permanently plugged into the electrical switch.
Keep the blender clean. If it is not kept clean, food can mold, grow bacteria or the blades can grow rusty. If bacteria, mold or rust are transferred to your food, this isn't particularly safe or healthy. Always clean after each use, using warm water and gentle dish soap. Never wet the engine part (base) of the blender; do not immerse this part in water.Keep the blender in a safe place. Position it so that the blender cannot be knocked off a bench or shelf. Separate the blender parts if this proves to be sturdier and safer.

The containers have a a metal handle which can easily start a fire to your microwave. All metal objects are a big no-no when it comes to microwaving food; They're easy targets to start a spark in your microwave. , Napkins, lunch bags, plastic bags, and newspapers are not safe materials to microwave. The intense heat from the microwave causes the paper materials to burns, letting out toxic fumes and starting a fire to your microwave. Avoid them at all costs and never heat them up. , Plastic containers that are used only once such as yogurt, sour cream, and margarine containers should never be heated in the microwave. These containers are only supposed to be used once; Once used they should either be thrown out or recycled. If microwaved, the plastic material will melt, let out chemicals to the food, and start a fire from the intense heat. , Many people have stated they've tried boiling eggs in the microwave and said its worked like a charm. However, it is not recommended. If you heat the egg for too long or if the microwave settings are too high, the egg will crack and explode from the rapid heat inside of the shell. If the explosion is bad enough, it could start a fire, especially if you microwave the egg raw without any water to boil.The safest way to microwave eggs is by cracking them before you heat them up. Some people enjoy making scrambled eggs in the microwave by cracking the egg in a mug and cooking it in the microwave, stirring it from time to time to ensure it doesn't overflow. Since there is no eggshell, the egg won't explode. , Styrofoam is a type of plastic and plastics and heat do not go together. Many people microwave their Styrofoam take-out containers without realizing the spark it can start. The intense heat catches the containers on fire and causes the containers to melt. , A few fruits can be microwaved without turning into a fire, but the most common fruits you want to avoid microwaving is grapes and raisins. Some people think that microwaving grapes will turn them into raisins, but if they're microwaved, it actually explodes and turns into plasma. If you microwave raisins, they will begin to smoke and catch on fire. , Metal and microwaves do not mix. Even if your plate isn't made of metal, if it has a metallic trim, it isn't safe from the sparks of the microwave. Be sure before you microwave any food, you check to be sure that the dishes you are using doesn't have a metallic trim. The metal will react to the heat and damage your microwave and dish. , Tupperware or plastic storage containers are never a safe material to heat up in the microwave because they're made of plastic, an easy target for a fire. They can easily melt when heated and start a flame when microwaved. There are some microwave-safe plastic storage containers, but be sure to check the container before you microwave it. , Soups, sauces, oatmeal, and other similar foods have a high chance of overflowing when microwaved from the amount of heat the microwave uses. Be sure to keep any of these foods covered by covering it with a microwave-safe lid or placing another dish underneath it. Some spills can reach into the microwave's machinery which could possibly start a fire.

For example, to avoid a fire from overflowing foods, you might place a bowl of chicken soup on top of dish to protect your microwave from its spills.

, Hot peppers probably create a fire inside your mouth, but they can also create one inside your microwave, too. Cooking hot peppers inside a microwave is never a safe idea. The hot peppers will catch on fire and when you open the microwave door, the chemicals from the hot pepper will release into the air, giving your eyes and throat painful sting. If you need to cook hot peppers, the best idea would be to cook them by baking or grilling them. Microwaving them is a big no-no.

, Some people microwave their travels mugs to reheat their cup of coffee or tea. Truth is, microwaving a travel mug isn't really safe and is an easy fire starter for a microwave. Most travel mugs are made from stainless steel which can damage your microwave. Some travel mugs are also made of plastic which isn't safe to heat up as well. Some travel mugs are microwaveable, however. Check the bottom of the mug to see if it states that the mug is safe to microwave. , Aluminum foil is a type of metal and metals are never safe when they're heated in a microwave. Even if this type of metal is a foil to wrap food, it's not safe to microwave at all and has a high chance of starting a fire. , Some people attempt to dry off wet clothing in the microwaves, a very unsafe tactic to try out. Most clothes are made out of cotton material, and the intense heat from the microwave is prone to start a fire. A microwave is not a substitute for a dryer; Microwaving clothes could cause them to smoke and flame out into sparks. , Some frozen foods that are meant to be microwaved come with food package materials. Unless the directions on the frozen food state to microwave the materials, never heat them up in the microwave. It has a high chance of causing a fire. , Most people won't intentionally put the microwave on for no reason at all, but some people put the microwave on to set easy timers. This isn't safe and is prone to start a fire. The microwave needs something to absorb, and when there's nothing to absorb, the microwave absorbs itself. This causes the microwave to self-destruct, blowing up, and turning into a pile of flames. , When you buy a brand new microwave, it's very important to always read the manufacturers operating procedures and safety precautions first. This is an important set of instructions on how to use your microwave without you being prone to starting a fire. , This is especially important if you're heating up meals that take longer than three minutes. The longer the food cooks, the more likely it is to overflow, burn, and flame up into a fire. Be sure to periodically check your microwave and food to see what's going on as it cooks. , Unless you have experience fixing microwaves, never attempt to fix your microwave if it has broken down or has a problem. This cooking appliance includes magnetron, high voltage transformer, thermal protectors, and complex circuits. If you try to fix it and end up making a mistake when doing so, you have a high chance of your microwave breaking down even worse than before and possibly catching on fire when trying to be used. , Damaged power cords or plugs are a big fire starter to microwaves. Electric shocks can happen if the microwave is on and then it can lead to a bunch of flames. Be sure all power cords and plugs are in proper shape and are working well. , Most of those burned using a microwave are under the age of five. Be sure that if you live with any children, they are not keen to touching the microwave. Kids have creative minds and may end up starting a fire unintentionally if they play around with this cooking appliance.


To avoid children from touching the microwave, you can place the microwave in a higher area so they're unable to reach it. You can also install baby gates to avoid them from entering the kitchen.

, While the microwave is on, never put any objects on top of it, especially if the material is made out of metal, paper, or plastic. The heat from the microwave will cause the objects to melt, smoke, and then turn into a nasty fire. Keep any materials away from the microwave when it's in use. , If food is cooked for too long, it will begin to burn, start smoking, and then eventually turn into a fire. Be sure you constantly check the food while it heats up to avoid it from overcooking. You may also want to check the instructions on how long the food needs to cook in the microwave. For example, when making microwave popcorn, you may want to check the package instructions on how long to cook the popcorn to avoid it from overcooking.

, Any type of cookware, whether it's glass, plastic, or ceramic containers, must be checked to ensure they microwave-safe. Usually on the back of the cookware it'll state whether if the material is microwavable or not. When buying new cookware, be sure to check the package instructions to see if the material is microwavable or not, too.

, Sometimes when food splatters around in the microwave, it can enter into the microwave's machinery and cause a fire. Placing microwaveable paper covers underneath or on top of the cookware will prevent splatters from happening while you cook your food. , It happens. Sometimes your microwave will still catch on fire no matter what you do. The best way to handle a microwave fire is by dealing with it calmly and safely. Shut off the microwave and/or unplug it immediately. This causes the the fan to stop and the fire will get suffocated.


Never open the microwave door unless you know the fire is over.
If all else fails and the fire doesn't stop and/or starts to spread around in the kitchen, call your local firefighting service for more assistant.

If you hear about a food recall in the news or newspaper, listen to the entire broadcast or read the entire article to get as much information as you can. They will generally provide a lot of information for consumers.
Often times the media provides the products numbers and sell-by dates of the affected foods.
They may also provide a website or phone number for you to contact if you have questions about the food, do not know whether or not your food has been contaminated or if you have gotten sick from consuming the contaminated food.;
, After you come across a potential food recall, you'll need to verify the information you heard with the appropriate government authority.


Scroll through the list of recall products or search for a particular food here. They are generally organized by date of recall.
Once you find your specific food recall, click on the food item for more information. The USDA will provide the press release written by the USDA or food manufacturer, why the product was recalled, what the potential adverse side effects are, the food name, product number and sell-by date and contact information if you need to speak to someone directly.Write down all pertinent product information so you can use this to compare to foods that you have at home.

, After you've verified there has been a food recall of an item you think you may have bought or currently have in your home, you'll need to double check your product to see if it has been affected by the contamination.


Double check the brand name and product name. Not all products by a certain brand may be affected.
Look at the sell-by date. This is generally found on the side, bottom or back of packages. This is the date that stores follow and should sell the product by.This information is a key part on how food manufacturers help you identify a contaminated product.Look at the product's label and package code. The last part of identifying potentially recalled food items is the product label and package code. This may be near the barcode, but could be in a variety of other places on the package. Take the time to find this code as this is a very specific number given to certain batches. This will confirm if your product is the one that has been recalled., Many times food recalls will include ""fresh produce"" or those items that are not coming from a specific brand and do not have a package to help identify them. This can make verifying these recalls slightly more difficult.


Again, all food recalls including fresh produce will be listed on the USDA's or FDA's website. They will provide you the produce name and which retailers received shipments of the contaminated produce.
If you think you've purchased recalled fresh produce, call your grocery store immediately to verify this information. Ask to speak to the store manager or produce department manager.
If you're unable to completely verify if you've purchased recalled fresh produce, the USDA recommends throwing out the possibly recalled product regardless to keep you and your family safe., There are a variety of smartphone apps that can help you keep abreast of any food recalls. Some of the apps may also offer additional information on foods. They may tell you what types of additives or preservatives are also contained in some foods.


The USDA and FDA both have mobile apps that you can check regularly for food recalls. These apps will alert you to specific food recalls, provide contact information and provide other food safety information.
AlertMe is another app that specifically will provide alerts to food recalls pertaining to allergens. Many times foods say they do not contain any allergens, but actually do and are being recalled. This is a good app for those will serious food allergies.AskKaren is another app that deals with food safety. This one does not provide information specifically on product recalls, but provides a host of information on food safety., Another method of keeping up-to-date with possible food recalls is by signing up for the USDA or FDA alert systems.The USDA will send you an email newsletter that provides the most recent food recall information. You can sign up for this email service here: Food Safety Email Alert System

Foodsafety.gov also has a blog and RSS feed that provides up-to-date information on the latest food recalls. The blog not only contains information about specific recalls, but provides consumers with information how to deal with recalls, how to stay up to date with recalls and how to handle foods safely.You can sign up here: Food Safety Blog.

, Outside of the government, there are some other sources to find out if there has been a food recall.


Consider talking to your local grocery store staff. They will know of any food recalls as they will be responsible for pulling products off the shelf.
When you go in to do your weekly shopping, stop the manager's or customer service desk and ask for an updated list of any recalled products.

, Log-on to the the USDA website or www.foodsafety.gov. These websites are tasked with providing information on every food, medication or pet food recall.Not only will this website provide information about the specific foods that have been recalled, they will also provide instructions on what to do with or how to dispose of recalled food.
You may also want to call the USDA’s Meat and Poultry Hotline at 1-888-674-6854. They have food safety specialists that can help guide you via phone if you're dealing with a meat or poultry recall.They may also provide the information for the local health department as well which you can call for more specific information.

, If you find that you have a product in your home that has been recalled, you may be able to bring it back to the store for a refund.


The USDA or FDA may be providing refund money to stores that sold contaminated products. Call your local grocery store where you purchased the product to see if they are issuing refunds.
If you plan on bringing the food back to the store, make sure you have your receipt and the actual product. However, if it is a specific brand that has been recalled, you don't necessarily need the receipt, but you do need the actual food product to show you purchased it.
Also ask the store staff if they have replacement products or a different product that you can purchase instead.

, If you've purchased a recalled food products, its important to ensure that the product has not contaminated other parts of your kitchen or other foods.Spend some time cleaning to ensure everything is OK.


The USDA recommends washing all dishes, utensils and cookware in hot soapy water or in the dishwasher. This will sterilize all your flatware appropriately.Also wash all counter tops or cutting boards as well. Use hot soapy water or a bleach to completely sterilize the surfaces.If you stored the product in your refrigerator or freezer, the same cleaning techniques apply. In addition, the food was stored in a drawer or shelf with other foods and they were touching, it may be a good idea to toss these items out as well.

Always wash fresh produce before eating it.,
Cut back on consuming canned foods.,
Clean meat thoroughly if you're a hunter.,
Avoid imported candy from undeveloped countries.,
Be careful how you store food.,
Use filtered cold water to cook and drink.,
Test the soil in your yard.,
Eat foods rich in calcium.,
Consume iron-rich foods.,
Get lots of vitamin C in your diet.",How to Avoid Lead Exposure from Food," Lead was in paint and gasoline for many decades before regulatory rules came into effect in the late 1970s. As such, soil is frequently contaminated with lead dust, especially in heavily industrialized areas. To protect yourself and your children, always thoroughly wash fresh fruit and veggies before you eat them.Not only can lead contaminated dust settle on produce, but fruits and veggies can also absorb lead from the soil — making it impossible to wash off.
It's more effective to remove soil from fresh produce by soaking it in water for a while (30 minutes or so) before scrubbing it with something abrasive, such as a special brush.
Discourage your children from picking veggies and fruits from gardens and eating them directly. That practice may have been safer many decades ago, but in modern times, it can be hazardous.;
, Another relatively common source of lead is from food sold in cans. More specifically, lead can leak into canned foods from tins made with lead solder, which keeps the tins together.So instead of trying to find out which manufacturers use lead soldered tins, it's more practical and healthier to simply eat less canned food.


Commonly sold canned foods include soups, beans, veggies, fruits and fish. Eat more fresh varieties instead, as they're usually more nutritious, although more expensive too.
Canned foods also tend to be much higher in salt and they are sometimes contaminated with too much aluminum — which is another metal toxic to the body and brain.

, Although this wouldn't be much of a concern for your average ""city folk,"" hunting for food in rural areas is still done to a significant extent. The problem is that many types of bullets and pellets used to kill animals contain lead, which can contaminated the surrounding meat and tissues.Therefore, don't just wash the wounds, but cut out the flesh surrounding the bullet wound and dispose of it to be safe.


Buy bullets and shotgun pellets that are lead free, if possible, if you hunt animals and birds for food.
If you're unsure of the lead content of your ammunition, consider switching to bow hunting instead. High-powered bows can still bring down large animals from a safe distance.

, Countries other than the U.S., Canada and most of Europe can have fewer rules and regulations when it comes to lead content in edible products. For example, candy imported from Mexico, particularly types made with tamarind or chili powder, have been found to be relatively high in lead and not safe for children to eat, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the United States.Obviously most imported candy is safe to eat, but the standards and processing techniques in underdeveloped countries tend to be of lower standard compared to more developed countries, such as the U.S.
Buy imported candy and foods from reputable stores that are well established. Be very cautious ordering anything edible online.

, The storage of food can also be a problem in terms of lead contamination. For example, some food containers and pots contain higher levels of lead, such as lead-glazed pottery and leaded crystal glassware.Avoid storing foods such as rice, pasta and grains in these types of containers for long periods of time. Don't drink water, juice or wine from leaded glassware.


Glazes found on some imported ceramics, china plates and porcelain contain lead, which leaches into food.
Food stored in printed plastic bread bags run a risk of contamination because the inks used on the bags may contain lead.Instead, buy your bread fresh from the bakery.
If you store food outside, always cover it with a lid so that lead contaminated dust doesn't settle onto it.

, Many older homes still have lead water pipes and some of the newer ones that use copper pipes are soldered together with lead. The result is that lead contamination in water is pretty common in the U.S. To help reduce lead exposure, only use cold tap water for cooking or drinking (or making baby formula) because hot water often contains higher levels of lead as it absorbs it quicker.


Use water filters. Ion exchange filters, reverse osmosis filters and distillation can pull lead from your tap water and make it much safer to drink.If you don't use a water filtration system and live in an older home, run the cold tap for at least 30 seconds before using it, especially if the faucet hasn't been used for a few hours or so. The longer water sits in pipes, the more lead it absorbs.

, You should test your home and yard (vegetable garden for sure) for lead contamination, particularly if your house was built before 1978 or if it sits near a freeway or busy road where leaded gasoline can pollute your property.You can send in a sample of the soil to an authorized laboratory or have a licensed and certified inspector / assessor come to your house and test it. Sending in a sample typically costs less than $50 to get analyzed.


If the levels of lead in the soil are greater than 400 parts per million (PPM) you shouldn't grow veggies in or let your child play in or around it.
If the lead in your soil or exterior paint exceeds 400 ppm, you should contact your doctor and get blood lead tests for you and your children.

, A well-balanced diet is very important for health in virtually every way, especially for children, but some nutrients offer more protection from lead poisoning than others. Calcium, in particular, helps keep lead from being absorbed by your body.Healthy foods rich in calcium include: low-fat milk and cheese, yogurt, tofu and some green leafy vegetables, such as collard and mustard greens, spinach, kale and broccoli.


Aim for 1,000 mg a day of calcium, either through diet or supplementation. Postmenopausal women need 1,200 mg daily. Talk to your doctor about how much calcium you should be taking if you have any existing medical conditions, such as a vitamin D deficiency or hyperparathyroidism, as you may require a different amount of calcium.
Evaporated milk, powdered milk and foods made with milk (creamy soups, custards and puddings) are also good sources of calcium.
Although higher in fats, most nuts and seeds are good sources of calcium and other minerals, such as magnesium.
Calcium is also important for strong bones and teeth, as well as normal muscle contraction.

, To your body, iron and lead look and act very similar. Thus, when there's more iron than lead within your bloodstream, your body will absorb the iron first and let more of the lead pass through your digestive system.Healthy foods rich in iron include: lean red meat, low-fat pork, dried beans and peas, sunflower seeds, raisins, some leafy greens and fortified cereals and baby formula.


The recommended daily allowance of iron are as follows: Men between 19 and 50 years old: 8 mg; women between 19 and 50 years old: 18 mg; pregnant women: 27 mg; lactating women: 9 mg; people over 60 years old: 8 mg. Taking high levels of iron may cause GI issues, including nausea and vomiting.
Breast milk is also a good source of iron and calcium, so breastfeeding your baby is helpful in preventing lead poisoning.
Iron is also important for strong bones and to make hemoglobin, the compound in your blood that carries oxygen to all the tissues in your body.
A multi-mineral supplement that contains calcium and iron may also be helpful for avoiding lead exposure from food.
If you are taking an antacid it may decrease the absorption of iron salts.

, Vitamin C is helpful in combating lead exposure because it promotes the absorption of more iron and calcium within your body.Healthy foods rich in vitamin C include: citrus fruits, strawberries, cantaloupe, kiwi, mango, tomatoes, bell peppers, broccoli, spinach, Brussels sprouts, cabbage and sweet potatoes. Most Americans are likely not getting enough vitamin C on a daily basis, so eat more fresh fruits and veggies that are high in the nutrient.


Vitamin C is easily destroyed by exposure to heat and light, so eat produce fresh and soon after preparing it.
People and other higher primates are some of the only mammals that don't make vitamin C internally.

Heat and start the grill safely.,
Wear the appropriate clothing.,
Use the appropriate grilling utensils.,
Never leave a grill unattended.,
Watch for safety red flags.,
Check over the grill.,
Get set up.,
Clean your grill.,
Heat up the grill in a safe place.,
Remove or drain off excess fat.,
Keep all foods cold until ready to grill.,
Check all foods with a thermometer.,
Do not reuse marinades or dishes.",How to Avoid Grilling Dangers," One of the first things you'll do when you begin to cook is actually turn on your grill. Regardless of what type of grill you have, you'll need to let the grill get nice and hot in order to start cooking.


Start by following the manufacturer's instructions for heating. It'll tell you exactly how to turn on the grill and how long to let it preheat before you place food on the grates.For gas grills, turn on the gas followed by the burner. Once the burner is lit, you're good to start preheating. If the flame doesn't come on, turn off the burner and try again. Do not leave the gas going with an unlit burner.
If you need to use lighter fluid to get the grill going, only using charcoal starter fluid; however, it may be easier to use an electric charcoal starter which may be easier and safer for you.
Never use lighter fluid on coals that are already lit. This can cause dangerous flare ups of high flames.;
, If you're grilling, wear appropriate clothing and protective gear. Certain types of clothing or cooking gear can cause safety hazards as you cook.


Avoid wearing loose or baggy clothing as you grill. A baggy shirt can catch flame if it touches the grill grates as you lean over to reach foods towards the back of the grill.The same goes for cooking attire. If you're wearing an apron, tie it snugly around your body so that no loose ends are dangling over grill grates as you cook. It should be tied behind you, at your back, and not around your waist with the knot or bow at the front.
The best clothes are a fitted long-sleeve shirt with an apron tied around you with the ends tucked in or at your back. The long sleeves can protect your forearms from splatters or splashes as you cook.

, If you own a grill, you probably have some speciality cooking utensils to use. Use the appropriate items that are designed specifically for grilling.All grilling utensils — forks, spatulas, tongs, etc. — should have very long handles. This allows you to reach foods towards the back of the grill without having to reach your entire arm over hot food and grates.
Also choose grilling utensils that are grill-safe and can withstand high heat. Some plastic and wooden items will burn or melt over the high heat of a grill.
Lastly, choose items that do not conduct heat well at the handle. You want to be able to hold onto a set of tongs without them getting so hot you cannot touch them.

, As you would with any type of indoor cooking, never leave a grill unattended. Even if there is no food on the grill currently, you shouldn't leave a heated grill alone.Once you have turned on your grill, plan to stick around. If you forgot an ingredient, need to make a phone call or finish up some cooking inside the house, ask if someone else can ""man the grill"" for you.
Keep children and pets stay far away from the grill. There are hot grates, hot food and hot utensils that could seriously injure a small child or a pet.
Ask someone that's with you to watch children and pets and keep them away from the grill and occupied elsewhere.

, Keep an eye on your grill as you're cooking to make sure everything stays safe. Be mindful of odd smells (like gas), watch for flare ups and mind the temperature.


Keep a nose out for odd smells. If you smell gas during cooking, turn off the gas tank and the grill immediately.If the smell continues, call the fire department and do not touch the grill.
While you're cooking, some fat may fall down onto the hot coals and cause a big flare up. These usually contain themselves and do not spread, but keep an eye out for them and have everyone else steer clear.

, Before you even begin grilling, a very important part of grilling safety is to check over the grill before starting it up. You'll need to check over the gas tank, burners, coals, etc to make sure everything is in working condition.If you have a gas grill, check the connections between the gas tank hose and where that hose connects to the grill itself or the burners. Make sure all the connections are tight and there are no leaks.
If you have a charcoal grill, you'll need to get the charcoals ready and lit prior to grilling. Have the right items to get your coals lit safely. Use paper and matches, charcoal lighter fluid or an electric charcoal starter.

, After you do a once-over on the grill, get everything else set up and ready to go to grill. Have all your dishes, foods and utensils ready before you actually begin grilling.


To start, place a fireproof pan underneath the grill to catch any grease or ashes. This helps prevent flare ups and extra mess.
Have your food ready. It should stay refrigerated until you're ready to grill.
Have a set of utensils and plates for raw foods and another set for cooked foods. You do not want to cross contaminate raw items, especially meat.
Have a fire extinguisher ready. Just in case, it's a good idea to have a fire extinguisher ready or nearby in case of emergency.

, Although you do clean your grill after you've finished using it, clean off the grill before you begin cooking as well. This helps give the food good flavor and prevent flare ups.


Contrary to what you might think, you want to wait until the grill is hot to clean off those grates. The heat helps burn up any remaining food particles on the grates and allows them to be brushed off more easily.Use a stainless steel brush to clean off the grates. With mild pressure, scrub the brush up and down all of the grates until all food particles have been removed.
Once the grates have been cleaned properly, you can begin cooking your foods.

, One very important part of safe grilling is making sure that you heat up your grill and cook on your grill in a safe place. If your grill gets too close to certain items (like a house or fence), you can cause damage to these items.Your grill needs to be well away from the side of your house, fences, the railings of your deck, from outdoor furniture and out from underneath low hanging tree branches.
Move your grill away from an area that is highly populated by traffic. It shouldn't be right next to a door or an area where people are constantly coming close by — especially children.
Clean dried leaves, mulch or other plants away from the base of the grill as well. Dried leaves can catch fire quickly.

, When you're grilling, you may choose to do a lot of different meats or vegetables that you've marinated; however, the fat on meats or from oil can cause flare ups, so you need to be mindful of the excess fat.


Fat, when it drips onto hot coals or burners, causes a flare up. This is when a big and very hot flame comes up through the grates.Flare ups can be a little scary and cause a baggy shirt or apron string to catch fire. If your bare arm is over the grill when there's a flare up, you can also get seriously burned.
Trim excess fat from meat and thoroughly drain meat or vegetables from their marinades. The fat from either can cause a big flare up on your grill.

, It's not only the grill itself that can be dangerous when you're barbecuing foods outside. Practice safe food handling techniques as well.


Bacteria commonly found in foods thrive at certain temperatures — this is called the danger zone. Foods between 40 to 140°F (4.4 to 60°C) are in range of the danger zone where harmful bacteria can grow rapidly.Refrigeration slows bacterial growth.
When you're grilling foods, do not pull out your foods until you're ready to put them on the grill immediately. You'll need to do your grill check, preheating and cleaning way before you take your foods out of the refrigerator to be cooked.
You have a two hour window to work with foods at room temperature. This gives you time to cut, chop, prep or do whatever steps are called for. After two hours, you need to cook the food, or put it back in the refrigerator until you are ready to cook it.
Fresh, whole fruits and vegetables do not need to be kept in the refrigerator. Only cut produce, meat, seafood and dairy need to be kept cold.

, Keep a grilling thermometer handy while you cook your foods. Not only is it good for safety, but you can customize how well done certain items are for your guests.Choose a thermometer designed for the grill. It should have a long handle so that you don't have to leave your arm over the hot grill grates while you wait for the temperature reading.
Any type of ground meat needs to be cooked until it reaches an internal temperature of 160°F (71.1°C) at a minimum.
Any type of poultry, leftovers or casseroles need to be heated until they reach a temperature of 165°F (73.9°C).
Whole cuts of meat, like steaks, need to be cooked until they are 145°F (62.8°C). People may want them cooked to a lower temperature, but to ensure they're safe to eat, cook foods longer.

, Remember to not recontaminate foods that have been cooked to a safe temperature. Pay attention to what fork or dish you use for cooked and raw foods.


Set aside one set of utensils for raw foods and one for cooked foods. Once you put the foods on the grill, go ahead and swap out the tools and utensils used on the raw food for fresh tools and utensils.
Also get out a new set of plates or platters to serve your cooked foods. Do not place them on platters that have been used to hold raw foods.
The same goes for marinades. Dump marinades down the drain that are leftover from being used on raw foods. If you want to keep some of your marinade, separate it before you put the meat in it.

Place the egg in question in a bowl or wide glass of cold water and see if it floats.,
Hold the egg up to your ear and shake it, listening for a sloshing sound.,
Crack the egg open on a plate or in a large bowl and check the quality of the yolk and white.",How to Tell if an Egg is Bad1," There is a tiny air pocket inside eggs, and over time more and more air passes through their porous shells and into the egg. As more air enters the egg, the air pocket grows larger, making the egg more buoyant.If the egg lays on its side on the bottom of the bowl, it is at peak freshness.If the egg stands upright on one end but is still touching the bottom, it is aging past its prime but is still safe to eat.If the egg is floating, it is not a fresh egg. This does not necessarily mean it’s bad or unsafe to eat. You should test the egg by cracking it open and looking for (or smelling) signs that it has gone bad.;
, As the egg ages and moisture and carbon dioxide escapes through the shell, the yolk and white begin to dry out and shrink, and the air pocket in the egg becomes bigger.A larger air pocket gives the egg more room to move around inside the shell and create a sloshing sound.


A fresh egg should not make much, if any, sound when you shake it.A sloshing egg only indicates that the egg is old and does not mean the egg is unsafe for consumption.

, The integrity of the egg will lessen as it ages, so it won't hold together as well as a fresh egg. Notice if the egg seems to spread over a wide distance on the plate, or if it stays relatively compact. An egg that spreads or seems a little watery has a thinner white and is past its peak freshness.If the yolk is flat and breaks easily, the egg is old.If the yolk moves around easily, this means the chalazae (the thicker strands of egg white that hold the yolk in place) have weakened and the egg is aging.Look at the color of the egg white. A cloudy white indicates a very fresh egg. A clear white means the egg is older (but may still be edible)."

Freeze the flour.,
Place a dried bay leaf in each container or bag of stored flour.,
Keep flour in canister type containers with lids.Storing flour in a container with a lid can prevent spread of weevil infestations through the pantry.

Remove all food from the cabinet or pantry.,
Clean shelves and containers thoroughly after an infestation.,
Once the shelves have dried, reline them with shelf paper.
,
Put all the food back.",How to Get Rid of Weevils (Flour Bugs)," As soon as you bring flour home, seal it inside a freezer bag and put it in the freezer for 96 hours (four days).Remove and store as usual. The freezing process will kill off any eggs and weevils already present in the flour.;
, This will discourage weevil infestation.,, Leaving flour in the pantry too long will encourage pest infestation. The faster it is used, the fresher it is, and the fewer the chances for infestation.


Purchase only the amounts of flour that you'll use within a month or two. Any more than this and you risk weevil infestation.
Rotate older products to the front and newer ones to the back so that you're always using up older products first.

, You won't get much done if you're shrieking and acting all grossed out. The bugs will not bite, sting, or harm you.

, Throw away all food that is or might be contaminated. In addition to flour, be sure to check your sugar, grains, dried beans and legumes, and breakfast cereals for signs of weevils.
,


Remove shelf paper (if necessary).
Wipe all areas clean with soapy water. Get into all corners and crevices.
Rinse with water. Bleach, if preferred.
Wipe the area with eucalyptus oil or ti-tree oil to discourage weevils from resurfacing.

Consume perishable food at room temperature within two hours.,
Keep your refrigerator and freezer closed.,
Cover your fridge and freezer with thick blankets to insulate them and keep them as cool as possible.

,
For longer outages, try to find dry ice to pack into your freezer.,
Have an instant read food thermometer.",How to Save Food During a Power Outage," Perishable food is safe at room temperature for 2 hours when the temperature is below 25 degrees C (80F). Above that temperature, you only have one hour before bacteria start to grow in unrefrigerated food.;
, Open the doors as little as possible. An unopened refrigerator should keep foods cold for up to four hours, although you will still have to evaluate each item individually when the power comes back on. A freezer that is half full should keep foods frozen for 24 hours, and a full freezer should keep foods frozen for 48 hours.

,, However, you must take special precautions handling it. If the power outage lasts longer than 4 hours, remove milk, meat, and dairy products from the fridge and pack them into a cooler with lots of ice.

, This is crucial to determining food safety after the power comes back on. If refrigerated products are still below 4C/40F degrees, they should be safe. Check to see if frozen foods still have ice crystals visible and that their temperature is below 4C/40F degrees. You can then refreeze these foods, but there will probably be some loss of quality.

Break the egg open and notice if it smells.,
Break the egg into a small dish and inspect the color.",How to Tell if an Egg is Bad2," This is the best indicator of a bad egg. A bad egg will have a pungent, foul odor when you break it open. The sulfurous smell will be obvious as soon as the egg is cracked (and possibly before), and the egg should be thrown out.A bad egg will have this foul smell, regardless of whether it is raw or cooked., The color of the yolk will change based on the diet of the hen who laid it, so the shade of yellow or orange nothing to do with freshness. Instead, inspect the egg white, or albumen. If it is pink, green, or iridescent, the egg has been contaminated by Pseudomonas bacteria and is not safe to eat.If you see black or green spots inside the egg, it has been contaminated by fungus and should be thrown away.If the yolk of a hard-cooked egg has a green ring around it, this means the egg has been overcooked or was cooked in water with a high iron content. This egg is still safe to eat.If there is a blood or meat spot on the egg, it is still safe to eat and does not mean the egg is contaminated or has gone bad. A blood spot occurs when a blood vessel ruptures when the egg is forming and has nothing to do with freshness."

Check the ""sell-by"" date on the package.,
Check the ""best-by"" date on the package.,
Use the 3-digit code that tells you when the eggs were packaged.,
Throw out any eggs that have been refrigerated and then sat out at room temperature for two hours or more.,
Use the packaging guidelines of your country to determine how long to keep your own eggs.",How to Tell if an Egg is Bad3," The sell-by date may also appear as ""not to be sold after"" or ""EXP."" This date is, at most, 30 days from the day the eggs were packaged.Eggs that are kept refrigerated and are not broken should be good for at least 1 month beyond the sell-by date.


The sell-by date appears as month/day in the United States. So eggs that must be sold by March 15th are labeled 03/15.
""Sell-by"" refers to the last date the eggs should be available for the public to purchase. Eggs should be pulled from the shelf after this date.It does not mean the eggs are bad or rotten after this date.

, The best-by date may also be labeled as ""use by,"" ""use before,"" or ""best before."" The best-by label must be within 45 days of the date the eggs were packaged.Try to use these eggs within two weeks after the best-by date.


""Best-by"" refers to the period of time eggs are at their peak freshness, with the best texture, flavor, and binding and thickening properties.It does not mean the eggs are bad or rotten after this date.

, Sell-by or best-by dates are not required by federal law (some states require them, other states forbid them), but all eggs must be labeled with the date they were packaged. This date usually appears as a 3 digit code using the Julian date calendar. This means eggs packaged on January 1st would be labeled 001, eggs packaged on October 15th would be labeled 288, December 31st 365.Look for the Julian date on the end of the carton. You'll see the plant code (a letter P followed by numbers) indicated where the eggs were packaged, and beside it you should find the Julian code.The European Union also requires that eggs are marked with a pack date. Even if eggs are sold loose and not in a marked carton, the consumer should have access to that information., Once an egg has cooled in your refrigerator, it is important to keep it at the same temperature. A cool egg in a warmer environment begins to sweat, which can encourage bacteria to grow on the outside of the egg. Because the egg shell is porous, it is sometimes possible for the bacteria on the shell to pass into through and contaminate the egg.


To prevent temperature fluctuations, store your eggs in the coldest part of your refrigerator, not on the door. The temperature is more likely to fluctuate on the door when it is opening and closing, which may cause your eggs to sweat.
If you receive your eggs unwashed and at room temperature, they do not need to be refrigerated. Many countries, including most European countries, keep their eggs at room temperature.This is safe because eggs are laid with a protective ""bloom"" which naturally keeps bacteria out. Once the eggs are washed, however, they must be refrigerated. Also, in most European countries, the hens have been inoculated against Salmonella prior to laying their eggs., If you have egg-laying hens and you're wondering when they will go bad, you can refer to your country's guidelines for freshness. It's a safe bet your eggs will be good for at least two months, if not more.


If you're not sure how long you've had your fresh eggs or if you think they are older than two months, learn the signs of bad and old eggs to help you decide whether or not you should use them in your cooking.

Wash and dry the ingredients.,
Assemble the salad.,
Place a paper towel in the bowl.Take a clean, dry paper towel and fold it so that it can rest at the top of the salad bowl.,
Seal the container.,
Store the dressing separately.Any dressing you plan to use for the salad should be stored in a separate airtight container.,
Refrigerate the salad.",How to Keep Salad Fresh1," Rinse the lettuce and other vegetables in cool water and dry them off. The ingredients of your salad must be completely dry before you put the salad together.


Most vegetables, like tomatoes and cucumbers can be rinsed under running water and dried with clean paper towels. Some, like carrots, may need to be scrubbed with a vegetable brush or peeled with a vegetable peeler to remove any dirt caked into the outer crevices of the skin.
The hardest vegetables to work with in this case will be your lettuce and other leafy greens. To thoroughly clean and dry leafy greens, you should separate the leaves and let them sit in a sink or bowl of cool water for five to ten minutes. After that, you should rinse the leaves gently under running water and place them into a salad spinner. Spin the leaves thoroughly to remove all traces of moisture.
It is absolutely crucial that you send the lettuce through a salad spinner and that you dry off all the other vegetables. When trying to keep the lettuce portion of the salad fresh, you need the container it sits in to be as dry as possible. If moisture builds up inside the container, it will cling to the lettuce leaves and cause them to become soggy.;
, You can mix the lettuce and other ingredients as desired before you store the salad. Combine the ingredients in a single large bowl or in individual serving bowls.


Note that there are some ingredients that you should only add when you are ready to serve the salad. Hard boiled eggs can spoil fast and should not be stored with the rest of the salad. Most fruits have too much water content and can cause the lettuce to wilt too quickly even if you take precautions against moisture.

, If you have a large bowl of salad, you might need to use two or three paper towels.


The paper towels are another crucial element because they help keep moisture off the lettuce. Vegetables naturally contain a little water, so even if you dry everything off thoroughly before you place it into the bowl, some moisture will inevitably build up. By placing paper towels on top of the salad, you can protect the lettuce from getting soggy. The water will be absorbed by the paper towels instead of sitting on the lettuce leaves.
If your salad contains a lot of vegetables with a high water content, like tomatoes and cucumbers, you might want to consider adding more protection by layering paper towels in between layers of salad. Lay a little of your salad on the bottom of the bowl and place a paper towel over it. Spread out more salad on top of that and lay another sheet of paper towel over that. You can repeat this for two to four sets of alternating layers, but make sure that a paper towel rests on top.

, If the container has a lid, place the lid on top. Otherwise, tightly cover the container with plastic wrap.


If you want to ensure freshness, cover the bowl with a tight sheet of plastic wrap and place a tight lid on top of that.
Like moisture, air is another element that can quickly cause your lettuce to wilt. It can also cause the other vegetables to become less fresh and to spoil faster, so keeping air out of your container is an essential step.

, Do not combine the dressing and the salad before you store the salad.


If you add the dressing beforehand, you will introduce too much moisture to the salad and pretty much guarantee that the lettuce will become soggy and wilted.

, Place the container of salad and the container of dressing in the refrigerator. Keep the salad there until you are ready to serve it.


Every time you open the container, you should stir the salad some and replace the paper towel with a fresh one.
You should also replace the paper towel if it begins to look soggy.
When stored in this manner, salad can stay fresh and crisp for a week or more.

Cut the tomatoes into pieces.,
Simmer the tomato chunks at medium heat for about 10 minutes.,
Remove the pan from the burner and stir in 1/4 tsp of baking soda.,
Add the rest of your ingredients and finish cooking the dish.",How to Reduce Acid in Tomato Dishes1," Most dishes will require you to cut up the tomatoes anyway. You can choose how large or small you want the chunks to be depending on what you are making.


Note that smaller pieces will heat through more quickly.;
, If you are going to add the tomatoes into another hot dish, you may not need to cook them for as long. If you cut bigger chunks, you may need to cook them a little longer.Be sure to watch the tomatoes carefully so that you can remove them from heat if they start to burn or become too crispy.

, This amount works well for six medium tomatoes, so for more or less tomatoes you can adjust the amount of baking soda. Stir the baking soda so that all the pieces of tomato get a slight coating.The baking soda will fizz as it reacts with the acid of the tomatoes.

, Once the fizzing has stopped, which may take a minute or so, finish cooking the dish. The baking soda will reduce the overall acid content of the dish and does not usually alter the taste of the dish.

Prepare your fruits.,
Coat cut fruits in an antioxidant fruit juice.If you are using fruits in your salad that are likely to brown when exposed to air, you should protect them by tossing the cut pieces in a little lemon juice.,
Submerge the fruit in cold water.Another way to preserve the freshness of cut fruit for a longer period of time is to place the fruit pieces into a plastic container and cover them with fresh, cold water.,
Refrigerate the fruit salad.,
Drain the water when ready to serve.,
Save the dressing until the end.",How to Keep Salad Fresh2," Wash, dry, and cut the fruit for your salad. Many types of fruit are difficult to keep fresh once cut, but there are methods you can use to help prolong freshness. Consider whether you want to prepare these fruits in advance using these techniques or if you want to add these fruits to the salad just before serving it.

,


Apples, pears, and bananas oxidize when the flesh of the fruit is exposed to air. This oxidation process is what causes these fruits to quickly turn brown after you cut them.
While lemon juice is the most common juice used to protect sensitive fruits from oxidation, most citrus juices would work. That includes lime juice, pineapple juice, and orange juice.

, Cover the container with a lid.


The water needs to be as cold as you can get it to be without adding ice.
You also need to fill the container to the brim with water. The pieces of fruit should be completely submerged and should not be able to come into contact with any air.
You can store the fruit separately in this manner or you can mix the salad and keep the entire thing, minus the dressing, submerged in water.
Note that this is only necessary if you have fruit that will oxidize, like apples or pears. It is not necessary if your fruit salad only consists of citrus fruits or whole berries.

, Place the container of fruit salad in the refrigerator and chill until you are ready to serve it.


Many types of fruit need to be refrigerated in order to stay fresh, including most berries. All cut fruit should also be stored in the refrigerator. As such, virtually any prepared fruit salad will need to be chilled, even if there are no fruits in it that can oxidize.
Even in the refrigerator, you should only store fruit salad for three to five days at maximum. Even if you can preserve it past that point, much of the fruit will lose a good portion of its freshness.

, Immediately before you intend to serve the fruit salad, take it out of the refrigerator and drain the water from it. Drain as much of the water away as possible.


You could also scoop the fruit out of the container with a slotted spoon.

, Do not refrigerate the fruit salad with the dressing mixed in. Instead, prepare the dressing just before you plan to serve the fruit salad and toss the prepared fruit into it before dishing it out.

"
"
Store in an airtight container.,
Refrigerate the salad.,
Add the dressing immediately before serving.,
Know how long the salad can last.",How to Keep Salad Fresh3," For the most part, other types of salads can be prepared ahead of time. Place the prepared ingredients into an airtight plastic container and seal it well. You will not need to make any other special storage preparations to keep various other salad types fresh.


Other types of salad you may consider saving include egg salad, potato salad, pasta salad, chicken salad, and tuna salad.
Food tends to spoil faster when exposed to air, so an airtight seal is essential if you really want to keep your salads both fresh and safe to eat.

, All pre-cooked ingredients will need to be refrigerated in their airtight containers.


Since most other salad types include pre-cooked ingredient, most will also need to be refrigerated.
Bacteria is more likely to grow in food that sits out at room temperature. As such, refrigeration preserves the freshness of your food while also keeping it sanitary.

, You can usually preserve most types of salads longer if you add any dressing before you serve the salad instead of adding it before you store it. This is especially true of mayonnaise-based dressings.

, Even after the dressing has been added, most salads can stay fresh and edible in the refrigerator for several days. As a general rule, a salad only stays fresh for as long as its fastest spoiling ingredient stays fresh.


Egg salad, potato salad, tuna salad, chicken salad, and mayonnaise-based pasta salad can last three to five days if stored in the refrigerator. Discard the egg salad if it is left out at room temperature for more than two hours or if it develops an ""off"" smell.Pasta salad with a non-mayonnaise dressing can stay fresh for five to seven days."

Remove the seeds from the tomato.,
Reduce the cooking time of tomatoes.,
Add tomatoes last.,
Use raw tomatoes in the dish.",How to Reduce Acid in Tomato Dishes2," Carefully slice the tomato in half around what would be the equator line so that one half has the stem and one half has the bottom. Then use a ¼ teaspoon, or another small spoon, and scoop the tomato seeds out and discard them. Don’t scrape too deeply into the flesh of the tomato.The seeds carry much of the acid content of the tomato plant, so removing them altogether is a great way to reduce the acidity.
Some dishes are enhanced by cooking the seeds along with the flesh of the tomato, so take this into account before you remove the seeds.

, Tomatoes become more acidic as they cook longer, so reducing the cook time to the least amount possible can help keep the acid level lower. Sauces and other dishes that require long simmering may make this difficult, but it is recommended that you don’t cook tomatoes for longer than 1 ½ hours.You may have to get used to using tomatoes that are less cooked, but if you deal with problems stemming from acidic foods it may be worth the effort.

, If you dish includes tomatoes, but tomatoes are not the main ingredient, add them after everything else has cooked for the majority of the necessary time. Doing this is another way of reducing the cook time, while still cooking them briefly.


If a dish calls for you to simmer the ingredients for one hour, put the tomatoes in for the last 10 minutes. They’ll have time to warm up and soak into the dish a little bit, but not become overly acidic.

, In the same way that reducing the cooking time can reduce the acid content, foregoing cooking the tomatoes altogether will reduce the acidity. Raw tomatoes are far less acidic than cooked tomatoes. If you can include the tomatoes in the dish raw without significantly affecting the dish, this will make them less acidic.If you are putting the tomatoes into a hot dish, the other ingredients will most likely heat the tomatoes up enough to even out the temperature of the dish.

Look for the ripest tomatoes.,
Cook with fresh tomatoes.,
Choose non-red tomatoes.",How to Reduce Acid in Tomato Dishes3," Tomatoes lose some of their acidity as they ripen, so avoid tomatoes that appear to be less that fully ripe. Two good ways to check the ripeness of a tomato is to feel the weight and gently squeeze the tomato. Choose heavier tomatoes and softer tomatoes.Heavier means more juice, which means more ripe. Tomatoes that are soft but not mushy are more ripe than hard tomatoes.
You can also learn the smell of a ripe tomato versus the smell of an unripe tomato.

, The process of canning tomatoes ends up increasing the acidity, so you can reduce acid in your dishes by only cooking with fresh tomatoes. You’ll have to buy fresh tomatoes more frequently than canned ones as they will not last as long., Tomatoes come in red, green, yellow, orange, and combinations of these, and in most cases non-red varieties of tomatoes are said to be lower in acidity. The next time you make your favorite tomato dish, try out some non-red tomatoes and see if you notice a difference in the acidity.This is not a hard and fast rule as there are red varieties that are low-acid and non-red varieties that are high-acid.
Some varieties to keep an eye out for are Yellow pear, a tomato similar to cherry varieties, Georgia Streak, a yellow heirloom variety, and Big Rainbow, a golden-red tomato.

Try homemade chili powder.",How to Make Mixed Spice," This manual device is a thin grater that’s designed to grate a single whole spice at a time. While effective for grinding, a microplane grater is better for very small quantities of spices, such as when you want to grate fresh cinnamon on a hot drink.


To use a microplane grater, hold the grater by the handle in one hand. Carefully run your whole spice back and forth on the grater edges. Be very careful not to grate your fingers.
Because a microplane grater requires you to get your fingers so close to the grating edge, it works best with large whole spices like nutmeg and cinnamon sticks.;
, A pestle and mortar is another manual way to grind spices. Because the bowl allows you to grind more spices at once, a pestle and mortar is great for about a quarter-cup of spices at a time.


To grind with a pestle and mortar, place the spices into the mortar (the bowl). Use the pestle to grind the spices into the bottom of the mortar. You can also spin the pestle around in the mortar until you achieve the desired grind.
This method doesn’t require you to put your fingers close to a grater, so you can grind much smaller spices like pepper, cumin, and caraway.
A pestle and mortar can also be used for spreads like pesto and curry pastes., A spice grinder is a small electronic device that has a large cup with a blade inside. When you put in the spices and push down on the lid, the blade spins and grinds the spices. These are simple to use and very effective, especially for larger quantities of spices.


To use a spice grinder, simply place your spices into the basin or cup. Put on the lid and push down for about 30 seconds. Remove the lid and check for large pieces of spice. Grind for another 30 seconds if necessary.
To clean this device, empty out all the ground spices and add in several grains of rice. Grind the rice to remove any large spice pieces and sweep up leftover spice dust. Dump out the rice and wipe the inside clean with a paper towel., A basic coffee grinder is essentially the same thing as a spice grinder. The reason the two are differentiated is because spices and coffee both have very powerful and unique flavors. Using a coffee grinder will make your spices taste like coffee and your coffee taste like spices, and vice versa.


If you must use a coffee grinder to grind spices, grind up ¼ cup (49 g) of rice first to remove excess coffee from the grinder. Dump out the coffee dust and wipe the grinder with a paper towel.
Add and grind your spices. Pour them out and run more rice through the grinder before wiping it out with a clean paper towel to make it suitable for coffee again., Making mixed spice is quite simple, and you'll only need a couple tools.Along with your spices, you'll also need something to grind whole spices, a small bowl, a spoon, an air-tight jar for storing the mixed spice, and a marker to label the jar.


You can start with either whole or ground spices to make mixed spice. Pre-ground spices are more convenient, but grinding your own whole spices will result in a fresher spice mix.
To grind your own spices, you can use a spice grinder, pestle and mortar, or coffee grinder.

, For spices that are already ground, simply measure out the correct quantity and transfer it to your jar. For whole spices, grind each spice individually, then transfer it to a small bowl. Measure the ground spice to ensure you have the right quantity, and add it to the jar. When all the spices have been added, stir the mix with a spoon.


For a tablespoon of ground allspice, you'll need 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of berries.For a tablespoon of cinnamon, you'll need about 4.5 inches (11 cm) of cinnamon sticks.
For a tablespoon of nutmeg, you'll need about 1.5 nutmegs.
For a teaspoon of cloves, you'll need about 12 whole cloves.
For a teaspoon of coriander, start with a little less than a teaspoon of seeds.

, To keep your spice mix fresh for as long as possible, store it in a cool, dark place. Light and air will degrade the spices, so keep the mix in a pantry or cupboard. Always close the lid on the jar properly when you’ve finished with the mix.


Ground spices that are stored properly will stay fresh for about a year., In British cooking, mixed spice is traditionally used in sweet baking, dessert dishes, and a few savory baked goods. When you use mixed spice in baked goods, a recipe will generally call for about a tablespoon of the mix. Common goodies you can use mixed spice in include:


Dessert pies, such as apple and pumpkin
Savory pies like pork
Tarts
Scones
Puddings
Biscuits
Cookies

, The spices in mixed spice are ideal for pairings with sweet foods like fruit. Next time you make a fruit salad, sprinkle ½ to a full teaspoon of mixed spice on top.


Mixed spice can also be whipped into yogurt or whipped cream toppings that are used on fruit dishes.

, Similarly, mixed spice is also a wonderful addition to fruit smoothies and juices. Whether you're having a breakfast smoothie to get your day going or a healthy dessert after dinner, add ½ teaspoon of mixed spice to all your favorite fruit and berry smoothies.

, Mixed spice contains all the spices that are associated with winter holidays, so it makes a great topping for cool-weather drinks like coffee, hot chocolate, and warm apple cider.

, Curry is a spice blend that originated in India. It is popular around the world, and is commonly found in meat, vegetable, and fish dishes. There are many regional varieties of curry, and you can experiment with different spices to customize a blend. To make a basic curry spice, combine:5 tablespoons (30 g) ground coriander seeds
2 tablespoons (12 g) ground cumin seeds
1 tablespoon (10 g) ground turmeric
2 teaspoons (4 g) ground ginger
2 teaspoons (4 g) dry mustard
2 teaspoons (8 g) ground fenugreek seeds
1½ teaspoons (4 g) ground black pepper
1 teaspoon (2 g) ground cinnamon
½ teaspoon (1 g) ground cloves
½ teaspoon (1 g) ground cardamom
½ teaspoon (2 g) ground chili peppers

, This is a basic blend of five common spices that are often used in Chinese and Asian cuisine. Most grocery stores carry this blend, but you can also make and tailor your own mix. To make your own blend, grind together:1 tablespoon (7 g) Sichuan peppercorns
6 star anise
1½ teaspoons (3 g) whole cloves
1 stick cinnamon
2 tablespoons (15 g) fennel seeds

, This is a blend of dried herbs that originated in the Provence region of France. Herbes de Provence is often used with meat, potato, and vegetable dishes, but it’s a versatile blend that can be used in many dishes. To make this blend, combine:4 teaspoons (8 g) dried thyme
4 teaspoons (8 g) dried marjoram
1½ teaspoons (3 g) summer savory
¼ teaspoon (0.5 g) dried rosemary
¼ teaspoon (0.5 g) dried mint
⅛ teaspoon (0.25 g) fennel seeds
Pinch of dried sage
Pinch of lavender flowers

, Chili powder can be used in a wide variety of dishes, especially meat and vegetable ones. Chili powder blends vary based on region, but a basic blend consists of:2 tablespoons ground chilies
1 tablespoon (6 g) ground cumin
1 tablespoon (5 g) dried oregano
½ teaspoon (1 g) cayenne
2 teaspoons (4 g) coriander
1 tablespoon (9 g) garlic powder
2 teaspoons (4 g) chipotle chili powder

Talk to a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN).",How to Avoid Foods That Hurt Your Gut," Processed foods contain additives and preservatives that may cause trouble in your digestive system.By avoiding processed foods, you’ll not only help ensure a healthy digestive system, but you’ll probably feel better. Common processed foods include:Cookies
Crackers
Chips
Cold cuts
Sausage
Microwavable meals
Processed meats, like sausages, hot dogs, and deli meats, which contain nitrates and nitrites;
, These foods may upset the bacterial balance in your gut and undermine your digestive health, damage your gut lining, and increase the chance of cancer in your digestive tract.Avoid or limit your consumption of foods that contain trans fats and saturated fats like fried food or dairy products.
Focus on foods that contain monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fats. Some examples of these foods include fish, walnuts, soybeans, and spinach.

, Inappropriately prepared foods that have been contaminated can also cause problems for your digestive and gut health. Without proper preparation, you might introduce harmful bacteria to your gut and develop potentially problematic conditions like bacterial gastroenteritis (food poisoning). Make sure to:Avoid poultry that has been improperly handled or stored. For instance, avoid chicken if it has not been stored in air-tight containers and refrigerated at 40°F or lower (4.4°C).
Adhere to “use by” dates for foods.
Stay away from food prepared in unsanitary conditions. For instance, a kitchen may be unsanitary if cutting knives, cutting boards, and similar objects are not washed with soap and hot water after use.

, Improperly cooked meat can introduce dangerous bacteria to your gut. Because of this, always make sure to avoid undercooked meat.Beef, veal and lamb should be cooked to at least 145°F (63°C)
Pork should be cooked to 160°F (71°C)
Ground meat should be cooked to 160°F (71°C)
Poultry should be cooked to 165°F (74°C)
Fish should be cooked to 158°F (70°C)
Shellfish must be cooked to 165°F (74°C)

, Alcohol negatively impacts the digestive and gastrointestinal tract in a variety of ways. Not only can it reduce the effectiveness of the lower esophageal sphincter (the opening that separates your stomach and esophagus), but it helps increase the levels of acid in your stomach.


An improperly functioning lower esophageal sphincter can allow acids and foods back up into your esophagus, causing heartburn and acid reflux, or GERD.Most adults should not consume more than one or two alcoholic beverages per day.
Abstain from alcohol completely if you have a serious digestive disease or disorder., Mercury is a toxin that can hurt the digestive tract and cause other serious health problems. Unfortunately, mercury is relatively widespread because of industrial pollution. When trying to avoid mercury, remember that:Mercury can inhibit the production of important enzymes that help your digestive system, and your body, function normally.
Mercury may kill or undermine the ability of good bacteria to grow in your gut.
Consumption of mercury may result in abdominal pain, IBD, ulcers, diarrhea, and indigestion.
Foods that contain mercury include: seafood, duck eggs, protein powder, and fish oil.

, Lactose is a sugar commonly found in dairy products. People who are lactose intolerant have digestive systems that are unable to break it down. As a result, lactose moves on to the colon where it causes a variety of problems. If you are lactose intolerant:Stay away from dairy products like milk and butter.
Consider taking medicine that helps your body deal with lactose and your symptoms. One common product is Lactaid.
Embrace a dairy-free diet, if possible.
Consult your doctor if you have questions about lactose and your digestive health.

, Gluten is another allergen that causes digestive problems for people who are allergic to it. If you are gluten intolerant, gluten may damage your small intestines.Common symptoms of celiac disease or gluten intolerance include diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain, and fatigue.
Gluten is found in many grains, such as wheat, barley, rye, and oats.
Eat gluten-free grains and starches such as rice, corn, soy and potato.
Focus on fruits, vegetables, meat, and dairy.
Look for foods labeled ""gluten free"" or ""gluten friendly.""

, Some of the best foods you can eat are fresh foods that help you maintain a balance of bacteria in your gut. By eating fresh foods that are free from preservatives, added salt, and added sugar, you’ll keep a balanced and healthy gut. Focus on:Fresh food that is high in fiber. This is important because fiber helps in digestion. When choosing fresh food high in fiber, consider spinach, cauliflower, carrots, apples, or broccoli.
Green and yellow vegetables. These vegetables contain things like beta-carotene, flavonoids, lycopene and more nutrients that promote digestive health.
Fresh fruit juices free from added sugar or sweeteners.

, Probiotics are good bacteria that help keep your gut healthy and balanced. Without probiotics, your gut won’t function well, won’t be able to break down food, and will be a place where bad bacteria can thrive. Common sources of probiotics include:Yogurt
Aged cheese
Tempeh
Miso
Kefir
Sauerkraut

, Prebiotics are a type of carbohydrates that promote the growth of good bacteria in your gut. By consuming prebiotics, you will give good bacteria fuel to grow and help create a balanced and healthy gut. Some foods containing prebiotics include:]

Asparagus
Bananas
Onions
Garlic
Cabbage
Beans

, By writing down what you eat and how you feel afterward, you’ll be able to narrow down which foods hurt your gut. Without knowing which foods negatively impact your digestive system, you won’t be able to take steps to increase your digestive health.Write down what you eat every meal.
Make a log of when you have negative effects after eating, such as bloating, gas, diarrhea, nausea, indigestion, or stomach pain.
Examine your journal for trends. For instance, make a note if you get indigestion or other problems that reflect poor gut health after consuming tomato products or citrus.

, Your doctor will help you discover exactly what types of foods might be damaging for your gut and digestive tract. Without talking with a medical professional, you won’t be working with all the information you need.Consider seeing a gastroenterologist or other digestive health specialist if you have concerns about your health and diet. You may also want to see a physician who specializes in Functional Medicine, which focuses on discovering the underlying cause of a disease.Your doctor will examine you and ask you questions about your symptoms. For instance, let them know if you feel nauseous or frequently have stomach pain.
If they suspect you have serious digestive problems, they might run diagnostics like an upper endoscopy – a procedure that allows a doctor to view your upper digestive system.
The doctor might run blood work to get an idea of your general health.
People who have been diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn’s disease, colitis, or similar digestive problems should be especially careful around foods that upset their digestive tract.

, There are a variety of professionals who specialize in nutritional and digestive health who will be able to offer you guidance, but an RDN or physician is able to make you a specific meal plan, whereas a nutritionist cannot. An RDN has also been accredited by the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. By speaking with a professional, you’ll draw on the substantial experience of someone who has dedicated their life to nutritional health.A dietitian will be able to assess your overall health and diet. For instance, they will ask you about symptoms associated with digestive problems such as indigestion, stomach pain, or diarrhea. They will also gather basic information like your height, weight, and body fat index.
They will put together a dietary or nutritional plan for you to follow. For example, they may compile a list of foods you should eat and a list of foods you should avoid.

, Grate four to six lemons using a standard kitchen grater. You'll need about 3/4 cup (180 ml) of fresh lemon zest.


Start with four lemons, then zest more if they do not produce enough zest. You can also use more or less than 3/4 cup (180 ml) if you'd prefer a stronger or weaker lemon taste.
Before zesting the lemons, rinse them under running water and dry with clean paper towels. Only use clean, unblemished lemons for this recipe.

, Place the peppercorns in a spice grinder and pulse for several seconds. The peppercorns should be lightly and consistently crushed.


Do not fully grind the peppercorns during this step.
If you do not have a spice grinder, use a food processor or clean coffee grinder
For a simple variation, consider combining black peppercorns with green or pink peppercorns in equal parts. You can also use a “peppercorn medley” that contains a premixed amount of all three types.

, Place the lemon zest and crushed peppercorns in a mixing bowl, then stir them together until evenly combined.


While stirring, use the back of a fork to mash the lemon zest and crushed pepper together. Doing so should help hold the mixture together, thereby blending the flavors more effectively.

, Transfer the mixture to your prepared baking sheet, then place it in your preheated oven. Bake it for 60 minutes, or until all of the zest has completely dried.After pouring the mixture onto the center of your parchment-lined baking sheet, use a spatula to spread it into an even layer.
Check the mixture after the first 30 minutes and gently stir it before letting it bake longer. Continue checking every 10 to 15 minutes after that point, stirring as needed to ensure even drying.

, Scoop the dried mixture back into the spice grinder and process it until everything is finely ground.


As before, a food processor or coffee grinder can be used if you do not have a spice grinder.
The finished texture should resemble commercially prepared lemon pepper blends, which is approximately the same texture as fine sand.

, Dump the lemon pepper blend into a mixing bowl and add the salt. Stir well until the ingredients are evenly combined.


If you choose to use large-grain salt, you may wish to place it into the spice grinder with the lemon pepper blend and pulse it into the mixture. This should mix the salt into the seasoning while simultaneously breaking it into finer pieces.
You can technically prepare this mixture without the addition of salt, but it may not taste like most commercially prepared versions if you leave it out.

, Transfer the lemon pepper seasoning to an airtight plastic or glass container. Store it in a cool, dry place for up to six months.

Place the freshly trimmed stems in a glass of fresh water.,
Cover the herbs with a dry paper towel to help keep them from drying out.,
Store in the refrigerator for 5-7 days.",How to Store Herbs1," When you're selecting herbs, you want to pick very perky bunches and avoid any with lots of wilting leaves, or any sliminess or spotting. Generally, leafy herbs will spoil more quickly, compared to heartier herbs, which can be stored more easily.


Leafy herbs include basil, cilantro, parsley, and mint, and should be stored in water in the fridge.
Hearty herbs include sage, rosemary, thyme, and dill. These herbs should be bundled loosely and stored in the fridge, wrapped loosely in paper towel, but not in water.;
, Whether you've bought your herbs in a bunch at the market, or purchased them fresh in a plastic container, it's a good idea to remove the binding and examine them. Remove any wilting, spotted, or slimy stalks, and trim the end of all of the stems.Dry them thoroughly. Leafy herbs will spoil much more quickly if they're wet.
You don't have to trim much, just the very end of the stems. No more than a centimeter or two.
Do not remove the leaves from the stems. If you want to dry or freeze your herbs, skip to the next section.

, Generally, you want to treat fresh herbs the same way you would treat fresh-cut flowers. Put about 1-2 inches of clean filtered water at the bottom of a drinking glass and let your herbs sit with the cut stems submerged. Keep them unbridled and loose.


Don't submerge the leaves in water. Just the ends of the stems. Think flowers.

, Use a loose, open paper towel wrapped around the top of the leaves, and tucked into the glass. This helps to keep the moisture around the herbs, without trapping it against the leaves. It also helps keep the herbs from taking on the smells of your refrigerator.


If you don't have a paper towel, a plastic bag can work just as well. These tend to trap moisture against the leaves, making them spoil more quickly, but they can work just fine.

, Depending on how old your herbs were when you bought them, they should stay fresh in the fridge for up to a week. Change out the water every couple of days, and make sure they're not wilting or spoiling.


Remove individual leaves as you use the herbs, or remove whole bunches you plan to use and discard the stems.
Remove spoiled leaves you find, to keep the rest of the bunch from following suit.

Dry the herbs indoors in loose bundles.,
Dry herbs in the oven at very low temperature.,
Leave the leaves whole, or crumble them up.,
Keep dried herbs in air-tight containers.,
Store in a cool, dark, dry place.",How to Store Herbs2," When you get your herbs home from the store, dry them as if you were going to store them freshly. Rinse them, if necessary, dry them thoroughly, and trim the stem ends of the herbs. Gather them in bunches and let dry for at least a week. Different herbs will dry at different rates.


Gather the herbs in loose bundles, tying the stems together with rubber bands, twine, or old twist-ties.
Hang the herbs upside down in a cool dry place in your house, so the air circulates around them thoroughly.
You can also store your bunches in dry paper bags, which helps to collect falling dried leaves and seeds that can fall. Some people like the way it looks to have herb bunches hanging around the house, though.
Herbs are done when they're crunchy and dry and no longer have any moisture in the leaves.

, The fastest way to dry herbs is in the oven. Generally, you'll get more flavor and life out of herbs if you dry them more slowly or freeze them, but this is a method to use quickly if need be.


Arrange picked leaves across a baking sheet and bake at extremely low temperature, the lowest that your oven will go.
Turn the leaves frequently to make sure they don't burn, and the herbs should be thoroughly dried in an hour or so.Depending on the herbs and the temperature of your oven, the herbs can burn very quickly, or dry very slowly over a period of several hours. Leave the door open a crack and watch them closely, turning often, to keep them from burning.

, If you want your dried herbs to resemble the herbs you might buy at the store, crumble them by putting them into a plastic bag and massaging them with your hands, or with a rolling pin. It's also fine to leave the leaves whole and break them up when you choose to use them.

, Dried herbs can be stored in the pantry in airtight containers to keep them fresh for several months. Old mason jars, pickle jars, and other containers are perfect for storing a large quantity of dried herbs.


Light can cause dry herbs to loose flavor and color faster, so storing them brown glass or metal is a good option.

, Keep dried herbs away from heat sources like toasters, ovens, dishwasher, or the space above the fridge. The heat can cause the herbs to lose lots of flavor and color. Your pantry should be a fine place for storing herbs.

Remove the leaves and discard the stems.,
Chop herbs finely.,
Fill a clean ice tray with portions of herbs.,
Cover with a small amount of water.,
Freeze until solid.,
Remove and store in Ziplock freezer bags.",How to Store Herbs3," Wash the leaves of the herbs as soon as you're ready to freeze them. Pull the leaves off the stems individually and start placing them in a pile for chopping up and freezing.


This method doesn't require you to dry the herbs at all. If they're a little damp, that'll be to your advantage.
This method generally works best with leafy herbs like parsley, basil, mint, and cilantro.

, On a cutting board, chop up your herbs finely, to the consistency you would if you were going to cook with them. Depending on what herbs you're freezing, you can chop them according to your taste, or what you plan on using them for in the future.


Remove leafy herbs from their stems and roll them on the board in loose little ""cigar"" shapes, then chop them into thin strips, then chop them across the mince.
Roughly chop hearty herbs like sage and dill before freezing them.
Pull heartier small-leaf herbs like thyme or tarragon from their stems and freeze them directly without chopping., Rinse out an empty ice tray and wipe it dry, then start piling your fresh chopped herbs into the individual ice wells of the tray. Fill them as full as possible, so it'll be easy to remove them when the herbs are frozen.

, To make certain the herbs stick together, cover them with just a small amount of clean filtered water. You don't need to soak them, just pour a little on to get them to form solid cubes.


For an added treat, consider using a liquid other than water. You can make lemonade-basil cubes, or rosemary-simple-syrup cubes if you want. Get creative.
Sometimes, you won't need to do this at all, and herbs will freeze normally without any added water. It's good to use a little for a precaution, though. The cubes tend to look a little better in the end.

, Place the tray in the freezer and allow the herbs to freeze in their small blocks until solid. This will usually take several hours, so it's best to leave them overnight. If you notice a bit of frost on the top of the herbs, they're probably solid.

, Since you probably need your ice trays to make actual ice, it's best to remove the cubes from the trays, then store them in Ziplock freezer bags. When you need to use a portion of herbs, you can pop them directly into a soup, or into a stir-fry, and they'll defrost on the spot. Instant fresh herbs.

You can preserve the herbs using a MEDIUM:


Vinegar and salt are the most common mediums.",How to Preserve Your Herbs from a Home Herb Garden,";
,


Make sure you do it in a dry and calm morning during midsummer. Because on humid days the herb produces less oil.
Harvest the herbs just after the water droplets have dried from the leaves right before the flowers open.

,


Do not take more the one third of the plants foliage at one time. The plant needs certain amount of foliage to re-grow well.

, You can DRY the herbs:


Group six to twelve stems and remove any foliage on the base of the stems.
Put the bundle in a cool place.
Don´t let sunlight reach it. It´s not necessary to make a package.

Buy a fresh new can of clear polyester casting resin.,
Check the viscosity of the resin fluid.,Set up in an open air area with plenty of ventilation and away from open flames.,
Use safety googles, gloves, respirator and coveralls when casting with resins and chemicals.,Protect all exposed working surfaces with plastic or drop cloth from spills.,
Replace or clean airbrush nozzles immediately after use.,
Mix small amounts of resin and catalyst at a time.,
Read and understand the instructions before mixing and using resin.,Use less catalyst than the recommended ratio on the chart because the foliage and petal tips could easily burn or get damaged.,
Spray as lightly and gentle as you could.,
Coat one thin coat at a time to reduce heat shock and faster curing time.,Wait at least one hour between coats.,Allow proper ventilation and space between each leaf and flower.,Use a hair dryer in a low setting to help resin cure faster and dry excess resin.,Wait at least 48 hours to move and handle your flowers to avoid leaving prints or deforming your flowers.",How to Preserve Leaves and Flowers," A container that has previously been opened may be difficult to open if the cap/lid is sealed tight with resin exposed to air.

Find out the date the can was bottled because resin has a short shelf life; even in sealed, airtight containers, it can become too viscous to effectively coat foliage and flowers.;
, It is important to find resin fluid that can be sprayed or air brushed through the nozzle or sprayer bottle directly to the foliage and flowers.

If the resin is too viscous to be sprayed onto the flower you can carefully sprinkle and pour small drops at a time (This will be further explained below).

,,

Avoid breathing resin fumes. Resin has an extremely potent smell and just a small amount poured can fill a house with the smell for hours.

,, Resin can cure and set quickly jamming and plugging your sprayer permanently if you don't disassemble and clean right away., The container bottle should have an information chart with the proper resin/catalyst ratio depending of the size and thickness of the cast., Pay close attention to safety tips and warnings.

Use caution while mixing and pouring solutions. When resin makes contact with the catalyst there is a chemical reaction which creates significant heat.

,, The thinner and closer the petals and leaves are to each other will be more difficult to cast.

Some leaves and flowers are more difficult to cast because they are more delicate and could stick and clog-up to other leaves and petals.
Excessive heat and heavy resin layers could cause flowers to to curl, discolor and wrinkle.

,

It is difficult to spray with resin, you can dip thicker and less dense foliage and hang them dry with good results.

It is recommended that you keep your freezer at a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius) or below., When you are ready to use the peppadews, remove the stems and seeds before thawing them. If you plan to cut them up, you should do that before thawing them, too.Peppadews are easier to cut while they are still frozen.
To seed the peppadews, begin by cutting off the stem end and slicing the pepper in half lengthwise. Run a spoon or gloved finger down each half to brush the seeds away.
Note that peppadews lose some of their crunch after being frozen and thawed, so keep that in mind when you choose this preservation method.

Place the peppadews in a large mixing bowl after seeding them.

, Boil 3 or 4 cups (750 or 1000 ml) of water in a kettle, then pour the boiling water over the peppadews. Allow the peppadews to soak for 10 minutes.


After soaking the peppadews, pour the contents of the bowl through a colander. Allow the peppadews to sit in the colander for another 2 to 4 minutes to ensure that they drain well.

, Place the mustard seeds, allspice berries, coriander seeds, red pepper flakes, ground ginger, crushed bay leaves, cinnamon sticks, and cloves in a resealable plastic bag. Seal the bag and shake well to combine evenly.You can replace this blend of pickling spices with your own or with a commercially prepared mix, if desired.

, Combine 1 cup (250 ml) of water with the vinegar, sugar, and pickling spice mix in a large saucepan. Heat on the stove over medium-high until the mixture reaches a boil.


Even though distilled white vinegar is recommended, a wine vinegar, malt vinegar, or spirit vinegar would also work.

, Place the prepared peppadews in the boiling pickling liquid. Continue boiling the contents of the saucepan for another 15 minutes.


Boil the peppadews uncovered.
Stir the contents of the saucepan occasionally to ensure even cooking.

, Spoon the peppadews into prepared canning jars and pour the pickling liquid over them.


Use half-pint (250-ml) or pint (500-ml) jars. Do not use quart (1-L) jars.
Leave roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) of empty headspace at the top of each jar.
Stir or poke the contents of each jar with a spoon or skewer to release any trapped air bubbles.
If you are using more than one jar, make sure that you distribute the peppadews and pickling liquid evenly within both jars.

, You can process the peppadews in a boiling water canner, but a pressure canner is recommended.


For dial gauge pressure canners, process the jars for 35 minutes under 12 lbs (82 KPa) of pressure when at an altitude between 0 and 2000 ft (0 and 610 m). Add an extra 1 lb (7 KPa) of pressure for each additional 2000 ft (610 m) in altitude.
For weighted gauge pressure canners, process the jars for 35 minutes under 15 lbs (102 KPa) of pressure when at an altitude of 1000 ft (305 m) or below. Add an extra 5 lbs (35 KPa) of pressure when the altitude exceeds 1000 ft (305 m).
When using a water canner:

Process the jars for 10 minutes at altitudes between 0 and 1000 ft (0 and 305 m).
Process the jars for 15 minutes at altitudes between 1001 and 6000 ft (306 and 1830 m).
Process the jars for 20 minutes at altitudes above 6000 ft (1830 m).


Let the canner cool until it depressurizes, then slowly open the lid. Remove the jars with a jar lifter and place them on dry dish towels. Let cool for 12 to 24 hours at room temperature.
Sealed (indented) jars are ready for storage. Jars that did not seal properly should be stored in the refrigerator and used within several weeks.

, Store the sealed pickled peppadews for at least 2 to 3 weeks before enjoying. Waiting at least this long will improve the flavor.


No matter where you store the peppadews, the storage temperature of unopened peppadews should remain at or below 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24.1 degrees Celsius) to maintain the best level of quality.
An opened jar should be stored in the refrigerator.

Prepare the basil for freezing.,
Freeze the basil by starting a pesto sauce.,
Freeze the basil as is.,
Freeze the basil using a milk carton.",How to Preserve Basil2," Clean and dry the basil:


First, remove all leaves from the stems. If you're going to try out the second freezing method, then you will probably want to leave some of the buds intact. The stems should be discarded.
Rinse the leaves thoroughly, taking care not to bruise them.
Finally, remove excess water from the leaves by using a salad spinner or laying them out on towels to dry.

, Place 1 or 2 handfuls of the basil in your food processor, then chop or purée the basil leaves with extra virgin olive oil and a bit of salt. Coating the basil pieces with oil protects them from air so they can maintain their color and flavor. Pour the purée into small air-tight containers and add some extra olive oil on top. After defrosting the purée, re-process adding your favorite pesto ingredients.

, This method takes a little more time, but is still an easy way to freeze basil. This method keeps whole individual leaves or plant buds intact to use as garnish.


Put prepared leaves and buds on trays in the freezer for about one to two hours.
Once they are frozen, put them into airtight containers. Do not overcrowd them because they will lose their shape.
After defrosting for use, you can julienne the leaves or use them whole as garnish on pasta dishes or soups.

, This method is the easiest of all the freezing methods.


Simply pack the leaves into a cleaned out milk carton with the top cut down.
Seal the top closed.
Use quart (950ml) sized cartons and then put the sealed carton inside a Ziploc baggy to make it air-tight.
When you want to use the basil for cooking, cut off a slice of the carton and re-store the remainder as it was. The frozen leaves are great to use in sauces.

",How to Preserve Basil6," Basil will flower after all the leaves on one stem are fully grown, but the herb loses some of its flavor after the flowering occurs. The flowers appear in the middle of a bunch of leaves in a pyramid shape. Prep and dry the basil once all the leaves have sprouted, but before you see flowers on the stems so your dried basil will retain its full flavor.

, Separate bunches of basil leaves and cut the individual leaves from the larger stem. Separating them will help you lay them flat and clean them properly. Leave a small length of stem, no more than an inch, at the bottom of each leaf to help you bundle them and tie them together.

, Rinse cut basil leaves under cold water before drying them. This will remove any dirt, chemicals or other debris that may have fallen onto the leaves while growing or while being shipped if your basil is store-bought.

, Lay the rinsed leaves on a paper towel and gently pat them dry with a second paper towel. Removing excess moisture before drying basil will prevent molding during the drying process.

, Group the prepped leaves in a bundle and tie them together at their stems with a rubber band or twist tie. Make more than one bundle if you have lots of basil leaves.

, Hang the bundles of basil from a hook or wall tack to dry. You don't have to hang them in your kitchen, but make sure you choose a place with freely circulating air and moderate sunlight to aid the drying process. Choose a room with a window that can be opened to let air and sunlight in and preferably one where bugs won't be able to get to your drying herbs.

, Your basil will be dried and ready to use in about two weeks or when the leaves are dark green, dry and brittle to the touch. If the leaves or stems still feel a little flexible, let them hang another week.


Remove the rubber band or twist tie, separate the dried basil bundle and crumble the dried leaves with your fingers. Store them in a labeled jar or container for future use.

Stem and seed the peppadews.,
Blanch for 3 minutes.,
Dunk in cold water.,
Pack the peppadews into jars.,
Cover with boiling water.,
Add the salt and lemon juice.,
Process in a pressure canner.,
Store until needed.",How to Preserve Peppadews3," Slice the stem end of each peppadew, then use a small spoon to dig out the cores and seeds.

, Boil water in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Submerge the peppadews and allow them to simmer for 3 minutes.


As the peppadews sit in the boiling water, prepare a large bowl of ice water for the next step.

, Immediately transfer the blanched peppadews to the bowl of prepared ice water. Allow them to sit for 2 to 3 minutes.


Dunking the peppadews in ice water will stop the cooking process and allow them to maintain a better color and texture.
Drain the peppadews thoroughly by pouring the contents of the ice water bowl through a colander.

, Spoon the peppadews into half-pint (250-ml) or pint (500-ml) glass canning jars.


Leave the peppadews whole as you pack them. To save space, you may wish to flatten them before packing them. Do so by lightly pressing on the side with the bottom of a spoon.
The jars must be thoroughly cleaned and dried before you use them.

, Pour boiling water over the peppadews, filling each jar until only 1 inch (2.5 ml) of headspace remains.You can use the boiling water leftover from when you blanched the peppadews or use freshly boiled water from a kettle. Either option is acceptable.

, Add 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of salt and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of lemon juice to each pint (500-ml) jar.If using half-pint (250-ml) jars, add 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of salt and 1/2 Tbsp (7.5 ml) of lemon juice to each one.
After adding the salt and lemon juice, run a plastic knife or spatula in between the peppadews and the jar. Doing so mixes the salt and lemon juice into the water while also removing trapped air bubbles.

, For non-pickled peppadews, a pressure canner is strongly recommended due to the low acid content of the vegetable. Process the jars of peppadews for 35 minutes.


Wipe the jar rims using a clean, damp cloth and make sure that the lids and ring bands are tightly secured before processing.
The proper pressure setting will vary depending on the type of canner used and the altitude you are positioned at.
For dial gauge canners:

At 0 to 2000 ft (0 to 610 m), the pressure should be set to 11 lbs (75 KPa).
At 2001 to 4000 ft (611 to 1220 m), the pressure should be set to 12 lbs (82 KPa).
At 4001 to 6000 ft (1221 to 1830 m), the pressure should be set to 13 lbs (89 KPa).
At 6001 to 8000 ft (1831 to 2440 m), the pressure should be set to 14 lbs (95 KPa).


For weighted gauge canners:

At 0 to 1000 ft (0 to 305 m), the pressure should be set to 10 lbs (68 KPa).
Above 1000 ft (305 m), the pressure should be set to 15 lb (102 KPa).


Allow the canner to air cool until it depressurizes. Open the canner slowly and lift the jars out with a jar lifter. Let the jars to air cool for 12 to 24 hours on a dish towel or cooling rack.
Check the jars when cool. An indented lid signifies a proper seal. Jars that did not seal properly should be stored in the refrigerator and used within several weeks.

, Store the canned peppadews in a cool, dry, dark place. They can be opened and consumed immediately, but they should last for a year or longer if properly sealed.


Storage temperatures should not exceed 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24.1 degrees Celsius).
After opening a jar or preserved peppadews, keep that jar in the refrigerator.

Choose herbs for drying.,
Harvest herbs for drying just before their flowers open.,
Prepare for drying as soon as you've harvested the herbs.,
Clean the herbs if needed.",How to Dry Herbs1," Some herbs are easier to dry than others owing to their stronger leaves and oils. However, almost all herbs can be dried in one or another. Trial and experiment is the best way to find out which herbs dry best for you, with the expectation that some herbs will shrivel up and look like a brown mess when dried, while others will retain color and texture well.


Strong leaved herbs tend to be the easiest herbs to dry. These include bay leaves, rosemary, thyme and sage. A dried bay or rosemary leaf will usually retain its color and shape without any difficulty.






Tender broad leaved varieties can be a bit trickier, as they are easily affected by moisture and can quickly turn moldy if not dried properly. The types of herbs in question include basil, parsley, mint, tarragon and lemon balm. These need to be dried quickly to prevent molding.





;
, There will be plenty of buds to signify that flowering is about to occur. As for the time of day, generally it is best to harvest herbs after the dew has evaporated but before the sun has had a chance to evaporate the volatile oils in the herbs. This is usually early morning, give or take a bit for the specifics of your location.


Although generalist advice is to harvest herbs before the flowers open, it pays to experiment. Sometimes it's better to harvest after. It all depends on which form will allow the herbs to hold their shape and flavor best. And if you actually want flowers, then it makes sense to wait until the herb flowers first.

, The herbs will preserve best if they're dealt with immediately; allowing them to wilt or sit around and gather moisture or dust will spoil their flavor, color and appearance.

, Some herbs may need rinsing first, and a pick over to remove debris such as dried grass or weeds. Herbs can be gently rinsed under cool water, and given a minimal shake to remove excess moisture.


Discard leaves with blemishes, bruising or imperfections.

Gather your supplies.,
Mix equal parts sand and salt into a pan.Measure out your portions carefully.,
Add water to the sand and salt.,
Heat the mixture.,
Strain the saltwater from the sand.Now that the salt has dissolved completely into the water, it's time to separate the sand from the solution.,
Boil the saltwater.,
Outline an experimental objective.Objectives are often obvious, but it is good to have a concrete goal in mind when you conduct an experiment.,
Make observations.,
Discuss the experiment.By discussing an experiment in a group, you'll be able to compare your observations.,
Reflect upon the experiment.,
Expand upon the original experiment.",How to Separate Sand and Salt," Because this is such a straightforward experiment, you won't need any lab gear or equipment. This is a cheap experiment. Here's a few things you'll need:


Salt. Most households have table salt in the kitchen. If you're in a pinch, you can get salt packets from a fast food restaurant.
Sand. Although it depends on where you live, sand should be very easy to find.
A kitchen strainer or coffee filter.A coffee filter isn't a necessary part of the experiment, but it does help when it comes time to strain the saltwater from the sand. In most cases, a kitchen strainer is easier to use.
A pan and heating element. If you're in a chemistry lab, a flask and bunsen burner are arguably even better.A second pan or plate is also recommended to catch the strained saltwater.;
, Salt and sand mix together very well, and you can mix them together by shaking the pan around. If that doesn't work, stir it around until the two are thoroughly mixed.


For the sake of keeping the experiment controlled, do your best to make the portions equal.
You should have between 15g of salt and sand each.This roughly equates to 1 tablespoon of each.It's better to use smaller proportions. The experiment will prove the same point regardless, and it makes it easier to set up and clean up afterwards.

, If you have 10g each of sand and salt, add about 100mL of water, or just enough to cover the sand/salt mixture.


Too much water will make the experiment take too long to boil off.
Exact measurements aren't needed, but it can help keep the experiment consistent if you repeat it.

, Heat is the active ingredient when it comes to stirring up particles. A bit of heat will cause the salt to rile up and dissolve in the water. Stir it around if the salt you poured is in clumps. It may be interesting to watch the dissolution process occur, so keep your eyes peeled.


Medium temperature on a stovetop will do nicely for this step.
If you don't want to tamper with the dissolving process, you should leave the mixture untouched overnight.
Make sure not to heat the water to the point of boiling! This will simply cause the water to evaporate, and you'll have to start from the beginning again.

, This can be done be draining the mixture into a strainer. Make sure you strain it above a pot, plate, or pan in order to catch it.


Straining into a pan is arguably best, as it will be all ready to boil. If you lack a strainer, you can fish the salt out with a spoon but this may take longer to accomplish.

, In order to separate the salt from the sand completely, you need to return the salt to its original state. This can be done by boiling the water.Put the pan on a stovetop and let the water boil. Wait until the water has boiled away completely. Turn off the heat. From there, you should be able to see the salt remaining in your pan.


The boiling temperature of salt is much higher than water. For the sake of protecting your pot, you should keep the temperature relatively low on the stovetop. It may take longer to boil, but speed isn't worth the risk of damage.
From here, you can retrieve the salt. Put the retrieved salt next to the sand for the sake of completion if you so desire.

, In this case, you want to demonstrate the concept of solubility. The term ""solubility"" refers to something's ability to dissolve completely in a liquid.Although a salt and sand experiment is generally pretty simple, you'll find you get more satisfaction by going through the paperwork.

, An experiment is nothing without a critical eye. Making a habit of note taking during experiments will enrich the experience. You'll notice things you might otherwise overlook. Even obvious things should be written down. That way, you'll be able to make sense of it later. Observe the basic movements and changes in the experiment. Make note of the following.Although the salt dissolves in the heated water, the salt remains intact.
The salt needs the water to be heated before it dissolves.
The salt doesn't boil away with the water.

, If this experiment is happening in a class setting, it's possible that one of the experiments will turn out differently than the others. While this is likely a result of error, it's still interesting to see a new result and figure out where it came from.


If you're by yourself, checking out a recording of the experiment on a streaming site like YouTube can be interesting. Even if you know the result, it is nonetheless worthwhile to see how someone else went about it.

, As any successful scientist will tell you, most good science revolves around asking good questions. Look at your notes and think about the experience. What did you like about the experiment? Was there anything you might do differently if you had a second chance? Don't just think about the sand and salt, but all the things around it. What about different types of mixtures? A big part of good science is being inquisitive. Here are some questions you might ask:


""Does the type of heating surface affect how well the salt dissolves?""
""Would the experiment be different if I tried to dissolve it by stirring in room temperature water?""
""Is the salt pure of water after boiling, or has the salt changed?""

, Once you do the basic experiment, you should think of other questions you'd like to see answered. For example, how much longer does the process take if the portions are made unequal? Separating sand and salt is a very basic experiment, but the possibilities for a budding scientist are endless.


For a lot of homebrewed experiments, baking soda is very fun to play around with. You could try adding that to your mixture next time.Doing this as part of a group is more enjoyable than doing it on your own.

Drying times will likely vary if bundling together different types of herbs, so consider only making bundles of a single type of herb until you're more experienced and can mix the herbs knowing the drying times specific to each.






If you're doing a set of herb bundles, you might consider keeping the bundles sizes similar, so that the drying times coincide. This makes it easier when it comes time to store or used the dried herbs, so that you don't have to wait for the next bunch to dry. But it all depends on what you're doing with the herbs and your immediate needs.







, The paper bag can speed up the drying process and catch falling seeds, leaves, etc. On the other hand, having no bag means you can have some lovely bunches of herbs on display in your home.

, All sorts of items can be used to hang herbs from, including ladders, ceiling beams, coat hangers, a nail, etc.


Herbs can also be dried on a rack or screen. An old window screen can be used if clean and in decent shape. Position such a screen to allow the air to move freely both sides of the screen. If using a screen, you'll need to turn the herbs daily to prevent curling.







, Herbs should dry away from direct sunlight and moisture or they will spoil. Drying times will take anywhere from 5 days to a few weeks, depending on the types of herbs you're drying.

, The herbs are dried when they just become crisp and no moisture can be felt.

, Many dried herbs will crumble readily, making them easy to turn into herb mixes such as bouquet garni. Dried herbs are often great additions to potpourri too.

, Use a lower power setting, such as the half power or defrost power settings. Dry for 2 minutes, then let sit for 10 minutes. Check for the level of dryness. If it is sufficient, then use the herbs as required. If not, do another dry for about 1 minute.


If the drying of 2 minutes proves too long and the herbs have dried out too much, use a new set of herbs and reduce the drying time by 30 seconds. Keep experimenting to reach the right timing, depending on the type of herb.
Herbs that tend to air dry well with little shrinkage (such as thyme) will need less time in the microwave than herbs that don't air dry as well (such as basil).

, As already noted, the silica use means that the herbs are no longer safe for consuming.

Choose a desiccant.,
Pick the herbs.,
Sprinkle 2.5cm/ 1/2 inch of desiccant across the base of a glass or plastic container.,
Place the herbs onto the desiccant.,
Remove from the desiccant as soon as they have dried.,
Use for craft and display projects only.",How to Dry Herbs7," A desiccant is a substance that draws moisture out. Suitable desiccants for herbs include cornmeal, sand, orris root, borax, silica gel and even kitty litter.


Silica gel is popular because it is light and won't crush the herbs; it is easily obtainable from craft stores. However, when working with it, wear a mask to avoid breathing in its fumes.

, Pick when moisture won't affect the herbs or their flowers.

, Glass and plastic won't create moisture.

, Keep any flowers separate from one another (not touching). Leaves and petals that are close together will require pulling apart to ensure the desiccant goes in between gaps and dries out every part of the herb.


If the shape of the petals or leaves is important, check for any that get bent out of shape and realign them as you're rearranging the desiccant.
You can layer desiccant and herbs if wished; just be aware that the more weight on top, the more the plant matter beneath risks being crushed.

, This will only take a few days. Desiccant will leave herb leaves and flowers bone-dry and therefore somewhat brittle. To remove desiccant, use a small brush or a camera cleaning bellows to shift desiccant off the plant matter without damaging the plant. Handle with care.


Avoid over drying the herbs or they may simply fall apart when handled.

, The herbs are not suitable for consumption.

Choose an appropriate herb for drying in place.,
Use the fresh herb to add to the position where you want it to dry.,
Place in a dry area without moisture.",How to Dry Herbs8," Not all herbs will dry well in this manner but some leaves and flowers will dry this way, such as yarrow, fennel and rosemary.

, For example, in a vase/bouquet with other plants being arranged or add to a craft project such as a wreath or a woven plant object.

, Allow to dry as is, but do check on it regularly. If you see signs of mildew or anything else that doesn't look right, remove the herbs.

Cover fresh stains with salt.,
Vacuum up the salt.,
Mix borax, vinegar, and salt.,
Place the mixture on carpet spots.,
Vacuum up the mixture.,
Brighten the colors.",How to Use Salt As a Cleaning Agent2," Add enough salt on top of the carpeting so that is hides the stain. The salt will begin to absorb the liquid, pulling it out from the fibers. Let the salt rest for fifteen minutes.Salt is useful for removing such stains as those from wine or pets and can be used on tablecloths and clothing for the same purpose.

, It is better to use a vacuum attachment to ensure that you don’t press the salt down into the carpet. Most of the stain should be gone. If liquid is still present, repeat the process with more salt until nothing more is absorbed.

, For deeper cleaning, try this mixture. Place equal amounts of the three substances in a bowl and mix them together. Borax is a non-chemical cleaner that can be found in general retail stores., Pour the mixture out of the container and onto the carpet. Spread it so that it covers all of the areas you’re trying to clean. Allow it to stay there until it dries.

, Once the mixture is dry, the salt should have helped bring the liquid to the surface. Grab your vacuum cleaner, power it on, and run it over the area. The cleaner will be removed with no problem.

, Combine an equal amount or more of salt and water in a bowl. Dip a rag into the water, wring it out, then rub it quickly over the area you need to freshen. This has the effect of preserving and revitalizing fading colors."

Brighten colors.,
Remove perspiration stains.,
Neutralize blood stains.",How to Use Salt As a Cleaning Agent3," Combine ¼ cup of salt and ½ cup of baking soda into a large pot filled with water. Add the yellowed items, then boil for 30 minutes. It is not uncommon for larger, thicker items such as tablecloths to require repeated boilings or be left for longer periods of time to whiten., Once you have removed your cotton or linen from the pot, move it to the sink. Run it under cold water, making sure to turn the item until it it soaked and you are sure all the cleaner is removed. This prevents it from turning brown and degrading later.


You may also want to lay the cloth flat out under the sun to dry. Avoid bunching the fabric so that it doesn’t stretch. Avoid the dryer, as it can also stretch and dull the fabric.

, Add a half a cup of salt into the wash cycle to give washable fabric renewed color. This works great on preserving new clothing as well as restoring fabrics that have begun to fade., Combine four tablespoons of salt to one quart of water. Use a cloth or sponge to apply the saltwater to the stains. Gently work the water into the stains, letting it soak and adding more as needed, until the stains disappear and you can wash the clothing normally., Combine two tablespoons of salt to one quart of cold water. Soak the stained clothing in the saltwater for an hour. Afterwards, wash the clothing as normally, either using a washing machine or hand washing in warm, soapy water.


Fabric that can take high heat, such as cotton and linen, can be boiled in a pot of water after washing for extra effect."

Add hot water if you need extra cleaning power, then wipe up with a paper towel. Dump any salt in the pan into the trash.This can also be done on enamel and ceramic pans, ovens, and grease fires.
Do not use salt on non-stick surfaces. It will damage the finish.

, Hot water mixed with salt can prevent grease blockages in the drain. This must be done while the water is hot. For clogs that have already formed, mix a cup of salt, a half cup of white vinegar, and a cup of baking soda. Pour the mixture down the drain., Have a pot of boiling water on hand when dealing with the clog. Ten minutes after the salt, vinegar, and baking soda mixture has gone down the drain, chase it with the water. Rinse with warm water when you’re done to ensure the clog is gone and the mixture no longer affects the plumbing.

, Equal parts of salt, flour, and vinegar can be combined to make a paste that polishes most metals, including silver, gold, steel, and pewter. Place the ingredients into a bowl. Mix them until they form the paste., Use a cloth to pick up the cleaner and place it on the metal. Spread it around to cover the entire surface. Allow the cleaner to sit for an hour.

, For shining copper and brass, try citrus juice instead of polish paste. A simple way to do this it to squeeze the juice out of a lemon half and then add salt to the rind. Rub the lemon half over the surface of the metal.A lime is a possible substitute for the lemon.

, Combine equal parts cream of tartar, salt, and water in a bowl. All of these items can be found at a grocery store. Mix them into a paste and combine them as you would a polish by spreading them out over the rust spots with a rag.Lemon juice and salt also works. Use a squeezed out, salted lemon half on the rust.

, This should only be done for metals being treated for rust. The sunlight warms the mixture and activates it so it eats away at the rust. Leave it alone until it dries.

, No matter how you treated the metal, get it under warm water if possible in order to remove the paste. Another option is to use a clean cloth. Add warm water to it, then rub it over the metal surface. Make sure you get all the paste so it doesn’t damage the finish.

, Rather than leave the water to damage the metal, get a clean cloth. Wipe it all over the surface of the metal so that it removes all the water. The metal should look shiny. You can buff it with a clean, soft cloth to make it look better.

Request official transcripts for any and all colleges you have attended.,
Write your admissions essay, if required.,
Complete the application.,
Prepare for your interview.",How to Get Into Nursing School," Graduating from high school or the equivalent is required to get into any nursing program. You should try to make very good grades and have a high GPA. You should also do well in your science coursework.;
, You can go to school for an associate degree (ADN) or a baccalaureate (BSN) degree. BSN programs are more competitive and have tougher admission standards. ADN programs take only two years to complete and are less expensive. BSN programs require additional coursework and take four years to complete. Having a BSN degree will provide you with more job opportunities, a higher salary, and more career advancement opportunities.


There is also a licensed practical nursing degree, which is the lowest level nursing degree. It is usually an 11 month program for licensed practical nursing.

, Speaking with someone who is already working in the profession will give you a better idea of life as a nurse. If you do not know any nurses personally, you can contact a doctor's office or hospital and let them know you are a prospective nursing student. Most likely, they will happy to speak with you. , You can volunteer or work part-time in the healthcare field. This will help you decide if nursing is the right career for you. You can also put this experience on your resume when you apply to school. Many hospitals have volunteer programs.


It is imperative that new incoming nurses have a realistic and accurate degree of their job responsibilities as well as know the responsibilities of their allied professional help. A great way to do this is by beginning as a certified nursing assistant.

, You should create a checklist by which you evaluate each school. Your checklist should include personal factors that are important to you, such as the location, tuition prices, and your career goals. Other important considerations are the pass rate on the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX) , graduation rate, career placement services, and the faculty. , The school you choose should be accredited by the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission (NLNAC) or the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education ( CCNE). The school should also be approved by a state board of nursing.

, This list will help you stay organized throughout the application process. Your list should include the application deadlines and the application requirements. Also pay attention to any prerequisites you may need.


Some nursing schools will admit students on the basis that all general education coursework is complete before the start of the program. These courses may include anatomy and physiology, microbiology, general psychology, and human development.

, Many schools invite students who are interested in applying to an information session. These sessions discuss the application process, program curriculum, and tuition. Ask any questions you may have if you are attending one of these sessions. Note that this is not the same as applying to the nursing program.

, Nursing classes demand that you have math, reading, and language skills. The Health Education Systems Incorporated ( HESI) and the Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS) are the most common tests. These tests help schools decide if you will do well in nursing school. To ensure that you get into nursing school, study for this test beforehand so you can do your best. Online practice tests and study guides are available for both the TEAS and the HESI. Do not forget to sign up for any other testing the school may ask for. One example is the College Placement Test, or CPT. This is to determine if you are ready for college in general. You might need to study for this exam to make sure you get the highest scores possible.

, Some schools also want high school transcripts; if you are fresh out of high school, your high school transcript alone will suffice. Many schools have an online transcript request form you can fill out and they will send it electronically, cutting out some of the footwork you have to do. There may be a fee to send transcripts, no matter if they're paper or electronic.

, Many nursing schools require potential students to write an essay on why they want to be a nurse or on the roles of a nurse. The essay will allow the administration to see who you are as a person.Follow the instructions they give you and make sure your essay has no spelling or grammatical errors. If you know someone who has successfully gotten into nursing school, ask to see their essay for inspiration. You should also let someone else give you feedback on your essay.


Schools will be checking to see that you have a good understanding of the reality of nursing. It is a tough job and one that is physically, emotionally, and intellectually demanding.

, It is important that you pay attention to application deadlines and submit your application as soon as possible. Turn your application packet in as early as possible, as some schools review them on a first-come, first-served basis, and nursing is extremely competitive.Nursing schools look at many factors when choosing applicants. Your grades, extracurricular activities, and references are important as well. Schools are looking for well-rounded people.
The Nursing Centralized Application Service (NursingCAS) allows you to apply to multiple schools using a single application. All nursing schools do not participate in this service. Make sure the schools to which you are applying use this system.
Make sure you have completed the application fully and submit any supplemental materials (essay, test scores) along with it. An incomplete or late application will not be reviewed by the admissions committee. , Some schools require an interview as part of the application process. It is important that you present yourself well and let the interviewers see that you will be a great addition to their nursing program. The interview is a time to sell yourself.


You should dress professionally for the interview.
You should be knowledgeable about the school and program for which you are interviewing. You should do plenty of research ahead of time.
Be sure to turn your cell phone off, make eye contact, and have a firm handshake.
Have another person do a practice interview with you. You should practice talking about your career goals, experience, education, and why you want to become a nurse.

Freeze peppers to preserve flavor, but not texture.,
Wear rubber gloves if the peppers are spicy.,
Wash and cut the peppers.,
Freeze the peppers on a baking sheet.,
Transfer the peppers to an airtight container.",How to Preserve Peppers1," Any type of pepper can be frozen, either raw or already roasted. The peppers typically remain flavorful for eight or nine months, but they will be mushy once thawed.This makes this method best suited for peppers that will be diced and used in recipes.


Unlike most vegetables, peppers do not need to be blanched to maintain quality while frozen.This makes freezing a faster, easier preservation method than with many vegetables.;
, Hot peppers can cause a painful skin rash. Always wear rubber gloves while handling hot peppers, and avoid touching sensitive areas of your body, such as your face.Wash anything that comes into contact with the peppers with soap and warm water before using it for anything else.


While more scientific studies are needed, there is anecdotal evidence that latex gloves may not be able to prevent ""burning"" from prolonged contact with hot peppers., Cut the peppers in half and scoop out the seeds and the white membrane inside. Slice the peppers into strips, or dice them into small pieces, depending on how you prefer them in your recipes.


Red peppers are often roasted before freezing, but this is optional.
Cutting hot peppers before freezing is optional., Spread the cut peppers out in a single layer, so they will freeze separately from each other and not stick together. Put the tray in the freezer until the peppers are frozen firm, checking about every twenty minutes.


A baking sheet with sides is best to prevent the peppers from falling, but you may use any flat tray.
Alternatively, wrap each pepper in wax paper or another freezer-safe material instead, to keep them separate from each other. Move on to the next step.

, Once the peppers have been tray frozen, they are unlikely to stick together into one lump in the freezer. At this point, they can be collected and placed in airtight, waterproof containers, such as freezer-safe zip locked bags or sealed plastic containers. Remove as much air as possible from bags before closing.


Keep your freezer at 0ºF (–17.9ºC) or below for safe, long-term preservation.Label the containers with the variety of pepper, or with the general description, such as ""spicy"" or ""bell pepper"".

Dry peppers to create spice powder, or to preserve for cooking purposes.,
Dry any pepper in an oven or food dehydrator.,
Try drying chili peppers in full sun.,
Alternatively, hang red chili peppers up to dry for several weeks.",How to Preserve Peppers2," Peppers can be dried without any special equipment, although a dehydrator or oven can speed up the process. Peppers preserved in this way can keep for several months if stored properly. Once preserved, they can be crumbled in a blender to make a spicy topping, or soaked in water for 20 minutes to regain a palatable texture, then used in a recipe., These methods can be used for any pepper, although green peppers and bell peppers may take several hours longer than red chili peppers. Remove seeds and membranes, then cut into thin strips or cubes for fastest results. Keep the oven temperature at the lowest setting possible to avoid burning, or set a food dehydrator to 140ºF (60.5ºC) or less.Depending on the type of chili, strips or cubes may take anywhere from 4–10 hours to become completely dry. Check every couple hours, or every hour for an oven due to the less consistent temperature.


You may preserve roasted peppers this way. Roast until the outer skin blisters, then cut and place the unroasted side face-down on the oven or dehydrator rack.

, If daytime temperatures are above 85ºF (30ºC), and full sunlight is available, you may dry hot peppers outdoors.First, remove the seeds and membrane from the peppers, then cut them into strips or dice them. Lay them out on a mesh tray or a cookie sheet for several days at least, until brittle. Bring them indoors at night if the temperature drops low enough to form dew.


Bell peppers are typically too moist and thick-skinned to sun-dry. Try the oven or dehydrator instructions instead.

, Creating a string hung with produce, or a ristra, can provide decoration while you dry, and doesn't require anything besides a dry room with good ventilation. Thread a heavy needle with fishing line or twine, pierce the top stem of a chile, and loop the line around the top.Repeat with each chile, using the same length of fishing line, and hang the whole line up to dry.


This method is only recommended for hot red peppers, since they have thin skins with lower water content.Green peppers or bell peppers are likely to grow moldy before they finish drying.
Tie clumps of two or three chiles together to create a more decorative braided ristra.

Bring this mixture to a boil.,
Add the hot vinegar mixture until the peppers are submerged.,
Clean and seal the jars.,
Place the jars on a rack in a pot of hot water.,
Learn how long to boil the jars.,
Allow to cool.",How to Preserve Peppers3," Despite popular misconceptions, all types of pepper are considered a ""low acid"" food, and cannot be preserved with water-bath canning unless an acid, typically vinegar, is added to the peppers.However, the vinegar's pickling effect creates a flavor that many people enjoy. This method is also one of the best ways to retain most of the peppers' crunchy texture.



Note: Because this process can be complicated, reading all the instructions is recommended before you begin. A water-bath canner will make this easier.
If you have a pressure canner, see tips for a way to preserve peppers without pickling first.

, Put sturdy, undamaged canning jars and lids through a hot dishwasher cycle, or place them in a pot of water and simmer, below boiling point, on the stovetop. This helps keep the jars clean, and prevents them from shattering when boiling water is poured into them.You'll need tongs to remove jars and lids from hot water.

, Peppers should be prepared for preservation by washing them, removing the stems and seeds, and cutting them to the size you wish.

, Using larger jars or non-canning jars may be unsafe for this recipe. Leave about 1/2–1 inch (1.25–2.5 cm) of head space at the top of each jar.


About 1 lb (0.45 kg) of peppers is typically required for each 1 pint (475 mL) jar., Vinegar can be used as a preserving fluid for peppers, provided it's the correct type of vinegar. Try to use a high-quality vinegar with at least a 5% acetic acid content (or 50-grain strength).). Avoid using homemade vinegar unless you can be sure it meets this level of acidity.


Clear liquors will preserve the original color of the pepper, while cider and wine vinegars can darken the peppers but will otherwise work just as well.

, A typical canning bath batch of nine pint jars (or nine 500 mL jars) requires at least 9 cups (or 2250 mL) solution. At least 1/3 of the solution should be vinegar to safely preserve the pickles, but the other ingredients are up to your taste preferences. Here are two suggestions:


For bell peppers, use 3 cups (700 mL) vinegar and 3 cups (700 mL) water, and 3 1/2 cups (815 mL) sugar. Add 4.5 tsp (22.5 mL) canning or pickling salt for flavor, unless you want to make a low-sodium version.Optionally, add 9 peeled cloves garlic for flavor.
For hot peppers, or a mix of hot and sweet peppers, try 5 cups (1200 mL) vinegar, 1 cup (240 mL) water, and 2 tbsp (30 mL) sugar instead of a tarter result. Optionally, add 2 tbsp (30 mL) canning or pickling salt, and 2 cloves of garlic.

, Transfer the vinegar and water solution to a large pot over medium or high heat. Wait for the mixture to reach a rolling boil, then immediately remove from heat. Boiling helps eliminate germs and microbes that can contaminate the preserved peppers.


If you accidentally leave the solution boiling for more than a couple minutes, you may wish to add a little more vinegar and bring to a boil a second time. Over-boiling can destroy some of the acetic acid in the vinegar, which is the main preservative., Pour your hot mixture of vinegar, sugar, and water into each pepper container until the peppers are fully covered by liquid. Try to still leave about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of space at the top of the jar or container.

, Run a knife around the rim of each jar to dislodge air bubbles. Use a damp, freshly cleaned cloth to wipe the inner rim of each jar for additional cleaning. Seal the canning jar according to the manufacturer's instructions, typically by placing the lid on top and screwing the rim over it and the jar.

, Fill a water-bath canner, or a large pot with a metal rack on the bottom, about half full of water. Heat this until it is almost boiling, then lower the sealed jars onto the rack. Move the jars so none of them are touching each other, or the sides of the container. The water must be deep enough to cover the jars with at least 1–2 inches (2.5–5 cm) of water.

, The jars must be boiled for a certain amount of time, to create a safe environment for preservation. Start timing the peppers once the water begins boiling, not when they are lowered into the water. If the boiling is interrupted, you must begin timing from the beginning.


If you are at a high altitude, start with the times below, then add an additional 2 minutes per 1,000 ft (300 m) above sea level.Boil hot peppers for at least 15 minutes in jars up to 1 pint (500 mL).
Boil sweet peppers or bell peppers for at last 10 minutes in jars up to 1 pint (500 mL).
Safe boiling times for larger jars have not been established for these recipes. You may be able to find another pickled pepper recipe with a recommended boiling time for 1 quart (1 L) jars.

, Store your finished peppers in a cool, dark place, no warmer than 75ºF (24ºC).Under these conditions, the pickled peppers can typically last for one to two years.Once you open a jar, keep it in the refrigerator until the peppers are eaten.


Do not eat pickled peppers from a jar with a rounded or bulging lid, or if the peppers have turned brown or black.

Be prepared to share your concerns, doubts, thoughts, and feelings.,
Ask questions to clarify anything you do not understand.,
Listen carefully and take notes of things you want to remember.,
Ask for a written copy of advising recommendations for your own records.,
Keep a file of all the advising information you receive.,
Bring along your program advising sheet (if you already have one) and ask questions about anything you don't understand.,
See your advisor whenever your program of study changes, and also when you think you are within two terms of graduation.,
Start checking on university admissions 9 to 12 months before you plan to graduate (if you are a community college A.A. student).,
Don't expect the advisor to make decisions for you.,
Don't expect the advisor to comment on or recommend instructors.,
Ask your advisor to help you determine an appropriate course load.,
Deciding on an educational program is one thing; successfully completing one is another.",How to Get Help from a College Advisor," The advisor cannot read your mind. You should be candid and straightforward about any questions and concerns.;
, This is usually the most direct way to find out what you want to know. Also, letting something pass that you do not understand can often cause problems down the road.

, This will provide a written record of what was said in the session and you won't have to rely on your memory for details.

, You should receive a copy of any forms that are completed as part of the advising process. Then you are protected in case the original is misplaced.

, Your own personal advising folder can be very important. If you keep a record of everything you receive, you will have the documentation you need if a question ever arises about the accuracy of the information you received.

, If you are seeing a new advisor, it's a good idea to bring along your most recent advising sheet or, better yet, your entire personal advising file. Your new advisor should have access to the previous advisor's records, but this is not always the case.

, Changes in a major can cause changes in course requirements; check out requirements as soon as you begin to consider a change of major. The closer you get to graduation, the more critical it becomes that you have regular advising sessions to make sure you stay on track. Some colleges require advising at certain points of your academic program; others leave it up to you to initiate contact when assistance is desired. If you are not required to attend regular advising sessions, it's a good idea to check with your advisor every couple of terms or whenever you have any doubt about what you are doing.

, Some limited access programs have early application deadlines (which can be up to a year in advance of entry) and may require additional application materials, an interview, an audition, or other special documentation. You might also note that you are usually required to have a complete application package turned in by the deadline. It's a good idea to start early in case any questions arise about the materials you submit.

, Your advisor can provide you many kinds of useful information and can make recommendations with regard to certain issues, but he or she cannot assume responsibility for making the decisions you alone can make. He or she can help clarify requirements, alternatives, and consequences, but the decisions (and the responsibility) will always be your own.

, This is a matter of professional courtesy and political realism by the advisor. Much of the information advisors receive about professors is in the form of secondhand comments from students that cannot be easily verified. Advisors will not convey this kind of information to other students. If you want to know what other students think about a given professor, ask students who have taken a class from that professor and take what you receive with a grain (or a dash!) of salt.

, Especially when you are just beginning, it is difficult to predict how much work will be required by a given number of classes. This decision may be affected by the nature of the courses you take, your other commitments, your academic history, how long you have been out of school, your level of academic confidence, and other such factors.

, There are many factors that contribute to academic success, not the least of which is an appropriate initial choice of goals. Given this, the next section presents some commonsense advice about how to become a more successful student.

"
"
Get an idea of what college you're attending.,
Contact a current student.,
Pick the brains of the student you contacted.,
Look up the classes offered during the semester you will join the university.,
Make schedules and stick to them.,
Periodically revise what you learned in school.,
Earn Credits.,
Learn the icky domestic stuff.,
Visit a/the college campus.,
Expect a culture shock.",How to Get a Head Start on College," At the moment, you could be starting the application process, waiting for the letters from your college to come in, or you could be holding an acceptance letter and grinning. At whichever stage you are, you must have a good idea of what kind of college you plan to/are attending. Your college could be a State, Tech, International, Ivy League or Community college, and each of these types have slightly different expectation of the student. Once you have decided what type of college you are/will be attending, narrow the list down to about five of your favorites.;
, Whether you have one set choice, or five prospective college choices, it always helps to have a contact with a college or university.



Email the school's admissions office, tell them you are a prospective/incoming student and you'd like them to provide you with contact details of a current student at the college so that you can get an insider's view of what the college is about.

Use social networking sites such as Facebook, Myspace, Orkut, Friendster etc. and look for students enrolled in the college(s) you are interested in, and send them a message. Some social networking sites do not allow you to view the profiles of other people unless they approve, but they will usually allow you to send them a message or have applications such as marketplaces, public forums etc. where you can post information that anyone can have access to. You can use these public applications to 'list' your need. For example: 'Prospective/Incoming *insert college name here* student looking to contact a current student'.

Get the word out. It's a small world and many great things have bordered on coincidence. Tell anyone and everyone you can about the college(s) you're thinking about, why you want to go there and what you want to do. Yes, you might come across as inappropriately chatty and slightly self-absorbed if you overdo it, but it has great benefits. Someone might know someone who might know someone attending the college(s) you are considering, and might offer to put you in touch with them.

, This is really not the time to be shy. Consider it social skills practice for college. Make a list of anything and everything you wanted to ever ask about that college and send it off to the student. Be sure to ask nicely though, and tell them that they don't need to answer all of them, just any they feel they can. Ask them how social the dorms are, who the best professors are, how strict are the smoking policies, how many atoms in one mole of an element...whatever you like. Remember that the major questions will be answered on the school website or by the Student Services or Admissions department of the university, this is your chance to ask trivial and important questions. For example: how is the food on campus, how fast do classes fill up, what classes have the easiest/hardest workload, what did they find most challenging about the college etc.

, Registration is the very hectic for incoming freshman. Classes get full very fast and all the best professors seem to always be taken. Majority of freshmen end up taking classes they don't really want to take during the first semester, because they had no choice. Get information about the subjects as early as possible so that once you can register, you do and end up with what you need and want.



Email a professor/faculty member/advisor and ask for a list of suggested courses for the first semester. This is sometimes also available on the school website. Also ask for an academic course guideline, something that tells you what classes are prerequisites for other classes. This information is usually readily available on request. Be sure to include your major in your request. Also, send the request early so that they have enough time to get back to you.

Check for alternating classes. Most often, classes vary every semester. You will find a set of classes that are only offered in the Fall semester or some that are only offered during the Spring. Find out what these classes are beforehand and make a note of them.


Ask a current student for class recommendations for the first semester. They can usually tell you what they feel is best for incoming freshers and their take is a bit more accurate than an official's as they've been through it themselves.



Use all this information to make a tentative class schedule for yourself. Once you know what you want, you can go for it without the usual wondering, asking around and wandering that freshmen tend to do. Also, making the schedule yourself will give you practice on the schedule that you will have to make once you are eligible for registration.

, Start making schedules for yourself, for anything you do. Even if you're on summer vacation, make a small schedule for when you will watch TV, when you will go out, when you will read...etc. You don't need to make one for everything, but for enough of your activities so that you can get into the habit of managing your time. Yes, I used the 'T-word'. Everyone talks about time management and how its so important, and they do it for a reason. If you are not used to making timetables and following them, you need to train yourself and become more disciplined. This is the single most important thing you can do to succeed in college. Make a small, non-hectic timetable for yourself, and stick to it. If you find yourself not doing that, keep at it until you can tell your body to do something and it obeys. Even a mini-schedule can help. For example, a week's timetable could be as follows:


9:00 am - Wake up
2:00 pm - Watch TV
3:30 pm - Talk to friend
6:00 pm - Edit an article on wikiHow
Even if that's all you have, as long as you stick to it and do what you said you'd do at exactly the time you alloted for it, you're on the right track.

, This is very easy to do. Once school's out, everyone is out having fun and it's all too simple to simply forget all you crammed to get through school. Every once in a while, go over your notes, flashcards and anything else that you used to prep during classes and make sure you haven't forgotten all of it. Don't spend too much time on it, your brain needs a break. But do set aside time to go over it when you feel you can't remember what you learned in final year chemistry. A good time to do this is before you go to sleep. When you're lying in bed at night, try to remember problems done during class or chapters you studied for. If you can't recall some of it, relax. If you are drawing a complete blank, let your eye glance at the concept before you go to bed. College assumes that you know all your high school work. If you've forgotten it, you'll have a much harder time coping.

, One good way to stay ahead of the pack is to not give up studies completely. Even if you're on vacation, see if you can take an extra class at a local college, or online for as little as an hour a week. Another good option is to take a CLEP test. Western Civilization 1 is a good option. Either one will give you a jumpstart on your studying, and with any luck, you might be able to transfer the credits to your college so you don't have to take that class and can take a higher level one.

, When at college you would probably have to do things you really never thought of doing while at home, such as: clean the toilet, wash the carpet, get dust and gum (and worse...depending on who had your room before you did) out of unimaginable places. Next time someone is cleaning around your house, pay attention. Volunteer to do it yourself, if you dare. You might want to do it at least once so that if/when it's your turn, you don't ignore it/stare at it for hours/wish it away/do it wrong (all of these actions usually end up in out of control domestic situations, such as blockage, infestations, breaking of something, which result in Maintenance and Housing getting called in and you having to foot the bill for repairs) and avoid a situation that will annoy you and stress you out.

, Try to visit a college campus nearby so that you can get a feel for the environment. Even if it's not the college you will go to, it would be a good idea to familiarize yourself with it so that when you show up on campus you don't look completely awestruck. Also, if you've been at a college campus before, when you finally arrive at college, it wouldn't be your first time and some of the butterflies in your stomach will disappear and you'll be a bit more confident.

, You may have lived in the campus town all your life or you might have moved around so much you feel immune to culture shock. But it will happen, and in ways that you might not expect. College is a big deal no matter how good you are at dealing with it. Do not feel frustrated if you feel like matters are slipping out of your hands or if you're oscillating between highs and lows. Before you step into the collegiate realm, you have to admit to yourself that things can affect you and it's okay if they do. Once you accept that, if and when it happens you will be far more capable of dealing with it.

However, your professor will also likely notice if you work hard in the class to do your best, even if your best isn't an A+. The key is to push yourself to constantly learn more, and if you don't understand something, be willing to work with the professor to figure it out., Professors notice people who speak up in class and who actively participate and ask questions. Of course, you can't just spout off anything. Your professors expect you to know the material and then be able to discuss it in an intelligent, engaging manner.The more you stand out, the more your professor will notice you. Plus, they'll have something to say about you in your letter.

, You may not think your professor notices when you do little things like copy someone's homework or skip the reading. However, most professors have been in the business a long time, and they can usually tell when someone is a little dishonest, even if they're getting a good grade. Make sure that your integrity matches the grades you're trying to make., One way to help your professor remember you is to apply for something directly after having a class with them, even if it's early on in your college education. For instance, you could apply for an internship or a scholarship. That way, the professor has a reason to write you a letter, and then they can use that letter as a template when you need them to write others for you later., One way to get to know the professor is to seek them out during office hours. Of course, you don't just want to show up. You need to have a reason. You could ask a question you didn't quite get answered in class, for instance. You could also ask for a bit of extra reading on something you find fascinating. Try to engage your professors so that they remember you., Professors like to talk about what they're researching, too, so bringing that up can be a good conversation starter. Plus, you might find common interests, or you may even be able to assist the professor with their research, earning you even more brownie points.You could say something such as, ""So what do you work on outside of class? I always find a professor's research interests really interesting.""

, Another simple way to get to know the professor better is to take a second or even third class with the professor. The more the professor sees you, the more you'll stick in their mind. Of course, you really only want to take classes with professors you learn well from, as your education should come first., One way to get to know professors is to show up at events they are likely to be at, such as department events. Departments will have lectures, parties, and other events where you can spend time talking to professors in a less formal setting. Just make sure you actually go and talk to your professor while there.

, When getting recommendations for things like graduate school or an internship, you're going to be entering into the field you studied. That means that recommendations should come from professors in those programs. You don't want a kinesiology professor writing a recommendation letter when you're trying to get into a literature program, for instance. Stick to professors in your major.Skip teaching assistants. Even though you may get to know them better, their letters don't hold as much weight as professors.

, When you're asking for a recommendation, you're asking the professor to put their name on the line for your future. If you don't really know why you want to go to grad school, for instance, the professor is not likely to give you a recommendation at all. Be ready to answer questions about the path you've chosen, especially since the professor can use that information in your letter.For instance, your professor may want to know your end goal for going to graduate school. They may also want to know if you have the experience to choose the right program and the skills to complete it.

, When you go to ask, make sure to have everything ready. Your professor will need to know what organization the letter is for, as well as what program or position you would like. It's also helpful to provide them with a CV or resume so they have more information about you. Having your personal statement can also help. Plus, they need to know where to send it.Make a list of all the letters you'd like the person to write and include details for each one. Give them addressed and stamped envelopes to use to make it easier.

, If you ask for a letter a week before it's due, you're putting undue pressure on your professor that they won't appreciate. Many will still do it, but they will not be happy about it. Do you really want an unhappy professor writing your recommendation letter? Make sure to ask at least a month in advance of when you need it, though longer is even better.Also, don't wait until the end of the semester, as your professor will be getting far more requests then. Get your request in early.

, If you know the professor very well, an email may suffice, but it's usually better to approach the professor in person. It makes a better impression, and having you there may help remind the professor of why they liked you.You could say, ""Hi professor, I am here to ask if you'd be willing to write me a letter of recommendation for a graduate school program.""
After discussing any concerns the professor has, you could say, ""So, would you be willing to write me a strong letter of support?"" If they hesitate or seem lukewarm, you can politely withdraw your request and ask another professor.

, Most professors appreciate a reminder a month or two weeks before the letter is due. You can simply ask if your professor would like one. If they do, set it on your calendar, and be sure to send an email when it pops up.For example, you could say, ""Some professors like reminders close to the due date. Would you like me to send you a reminder two weeks before it's due?""

, Once the letter is written, be sure to thank the professor. An email is nice, but a handwritten card is even better. Most professors will appreciate the gesture. Later, it's a good idea to give the professor an update if you do get into the program or achieve the position you want."

Obtain a bachelor's degree.,
Take the required courses.,
Consider the prestige of your undergraduate degree.,
Volunteer at local hospitals.",How to Get a Medical Degree (USA)1," To get a medical degree, you first must receive a bachelor's degree. You can get a bachelor's degree in any field, but a related field is preferable. Related fields include pre-med, biology, chemistry, and physics.Some medical school admission committees like non-traditional students, i.e. students who have taken non-traditional coursework (like English) and students who have taken time off after college in order to enrich themselves.;
, While you don't necessarily need to major in pre-med, you must take certain courses to meet most entry requirements for a medical degree. In other words, you must take these courses if you want to be admitted to most medical schools.You'll need two to four semesters of biology with a lab, two semesters of organic chemistry (with lab), two semesters of inorganic chemistry (with lab), and two semesters of physics (with lab).
You'll also need two semesters of math (including one semester of calculus) and two semesters of English or writing.
Not all medical schools require the same classes, so make sure to research the schools you're interested in to see what their requirements are.

, When pursuing your undergraduate degree, picking a school with more prestige can only be helpful. Getting into medical school is very competitive, so having a more prestigious undergrad degree can help give you an edge.Of course, the Ivy League schools are all prestigious, but many large public universities also have good pre-med programs.
Look at acceptance rates from the program. That is, check into how many students are accepted into medical school from the undergraduate program. The higher the number, the better your chances of being accepted.

, One way to gain some experience is to volunteer at local hospitals and clinics. Many hospitals have a volunteer programs. For instance, you can work in the ER helping patients attending to their needs in the waiting room. While you won't actually get any practice as a doctor, you will learn about the environment and gain valuable experience. In addition, it can help you look more attractive to medical schools.You could also ask to shadow a doctor you're familiar with, such as your family's physician.
Some pre-med programs will have clinical experience built in.Consider volunteering abroad, in an international setting.
If you are committed to your volunteer program, they may be able to write you a letter of recommendation when you apply to a program. There may be a minimum number of hours you have to volunteer before you are eligible for a recommendation.

Check to make sure your degree is recognized by the Texas High Education Coordinating Board. This board requires that the institution you attended is accredited by the U.S. Department of Education., Make sure the programs that appeal to you offer the appropriate training. In particular, decide which grades and types of courses you’d like to teach. These decisions will likely affect which certificate you need, and which program you should enroll in.If you intend to teach trade courses like welding or computer-aided drafting (CAD), you may not need a college degree. Look into securing specific certification necessary to teach these trade courses.

, Various institutions – including universities, community colleges, and even school districts – can prepare college graduates to earn their teaching certification. These alternative certification programs are approved by the state of Texas.Reach out to the nearest Texas Regional Education Service Center Headquarters for assistance finding a program that will work for you.
These service centers even host alternative certification programs themselves!, Ensure you meet the eligibility requirements by consulting the program’s administrators before you apply. Usually, these requirements will include some minimum skills, a minimum GPA from your undergraduate studies, and a demonstration that you are familiar with the content you hope to teach.Some requirements are state mandated and some are chosen by the programs.
Reach out to a program’s administrators if you’re curious about how strict certain requirements may be.

, Meet with program staff to help you determine the specific course of your training. This will include some sort of teaching experience in an internship-like context, tests, and other requirements. Ensure that you’re prepared for a teaching internship by taking the necessary courses and tests to qualify for an internship first.Usually, you will be trained for about a year before having the opportunity to begin working as a teaching intern with supervision and mentoring.
Meet with an advisor even before you begin your coursework, to ensure you’ll be eligible to begin your internship as quickly as the program allows.

, Once you’ve met the requirements of your program, you’ll receive an eligibility statement to begin working as a teaching intern. Apply online with the Texas Education Agency for a probationary certificate that will allow you to do so.

Take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT).,
Know the requirements for the schools you're applying to.,
Fill out the application.,
Write, edit, and then re-edit.,
Apply broadly.,
Go in for an interview.,
Say yes.,
Reapply if needed.,
Apply for financial aid.",How to Get a Medical Degree (USA)2," The MCAT is like the medical school version of the SAT or GRE. It's a standardized test that you must take to be considered for entrance into almost any medical school. Like most standardized tests, each school will have a different ""passing"" grade that you'll need to achieve, so check with the schools you're applying to.You'll need to prepare for the exam by using study guides and practice exams, which you can get on the MCAT website.
The exam is split into four sections, which are, broadly: biology, chemistry, psychology, and critical analysis.You'll receive a score in each of these sections, as well as a combined score.Register, pay the fee, and take the exam. When registering, you should register more than a month in advance, because the fees are cheaper. Keep in mind, the test generally runs in the $300 to $400 range, and if you cancel too close to the exam, you won't get a refund. The test has set dates throughout the year with test locations throughout the country., Each school will have a basic level for GPA and the MCAT that they use to screen out students. In other words, if you fall below that level, your application may be automatically rejected.For most medical schools, you'll need at least a 3.5 GPA and at least a 30 on your MCAT.
However, those numbers vary from school to school, so try to find that information on the school's website.
Nonetheless, if one of your scores falls below the minimum, you can sometimes still gain acceptance if you are stellar in other areas. For instance, many schools take into account how your GPA improved over the years. If you did poorly as a freshman and then improved, a medical school may admit you with a lower GPA, as long as you show promise in other areas.
Try a post baccalaureate pre-med program if your grades are bad so that you can improve your standing.
Other factors the school may consider is the competitiveness of your school, outside difficulties, and how difficult your major was.

, When applying to most medical schools, which confer the Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree, you can use a common application through the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS). The centralized application service for osteopathic medical schools conferring the equivalent Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree is the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (AACOMAS). Essentially, you fill out one application that's verified through AMCAS, and that one application is sent to all the schools to which you're applying.The application includes biographical information along with academic information, such as your GPA and MCAT score.With medical school, you'll often be sent a secondary application. Sometimes, it's sent based on how well the school likes your first application. Other times, it's sent automatically.
This secondary application will include more essay questions, including one on why you want to be in medical school. Pointing out your diversity is often important in this section. Keep in mind diversity isn't limited to race and class; coming from a rural area can be part of diversity, too, for instance.

, When applying to medical school, like any graduate school, your writing skills can make you or break you. Through your written documents, especially your personal statement, you need to convince the school that you can communicate well and that you deserve to be in their medical school.When writing a personal statement, it's important to stay focused. Pick a theme, such as why you want to go into medicine, a personal obstacle you've overcome, or a story about your academic career. Whatever it is, make sure it shows who you are, what you've done to get where you are, and why you want to be in medical school. In other words, show why you're special.
It's fine to build yourself up some in the essay, as that's part of the process, but you don't want to go into overdrive patting yourself on the back. Show some humility, too.
Edit thoroughly. Read your documents through several times to find errors and awkward sentences. Have others review all your documents to help you figure out where you can improve. Many professors are willing to read over these types of documents, so don't be afraid to ask (though maybe bring a cup of your professor's favorite coffee along if they agree).

, You may have one or two schools that you really want to get into, but your whole future is resting on you getting into a medical school — any medical school. For that reason, it's important to apply to a wide range and number of medical schools, so that you have a higher chance of being accepted somewhere.That means you can't just focus on the highly selective schools. You also need to apply to some ""safe"" schools that you have a better chance of getting into.
Apply to at least 10 to 12 schools.

, If you're lucky, you'll be invited for an interview. If you get asked to interview, it means you are one of the top candidates, though of course it isn't a guarantee you're getting in. If you're given a choice of times, pick an earlier interview. It also gives you a chance to see the school. Be sure to get there early and to dress professionally.You have a one-on-one interview, a panel interview, or a group interview. You may also have a multiple mini interview, which is when the school does a series of small interview ""stations,"" each focused on a particular soft skill. In this type of interview, you'll only spend eight to 10 minutes at each station.
Be prepared to answer why you would be a good doctor. As with any type of interview, you'll need to convince the interviewers why the school would be glad to have you. You'll also need to be up on current issues in the medical community, and you'll need to be able to explain any problem areas in your application, such as a low GPA.
Also, assume you're being judged from the moment you step on campus and treat everyone you meet with respect. You never know who's there to report back to the interviewers and admission board., Once you've been accepted to one more or medical schools, you'll need to decide where you're going. When you've made a decision, make sure you send in your acceptance papers on time, as that tells the school you will be attending.Also, make sure to send in the rejection notice to the other schools.
Every school should provide you with a way to accept or reject a place at their school.

, If you don't get into any school, you can reapply the next year; however, if you do, you need to bolster areas of your application that were weak the first time around. For instance, if you don't have much clinical experience, take some time to volunteer or shadow a doctor. You can also take extra science classes to help prove you're ready for medical school.You can also retake the MCAT if you need to do so.
However, different schools do different things with multiple MCAT scores. One school may take the highest. Another might take the most recent. Still another might take an average of the two scores; therefore, it's important to check with the schools you're applying to.

, You will need to apply for financial aid through the federal government by filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which allows you to apply for federal student loans. Many times, you'll also need to apply for financial aid through your school, so you'll be eligible for scholarships.If you've been an undergraduate in the United States, the FAFSA should be familiar to you. You'll need to fill in basic biographical information, as well as your income. One difference you may have is filling out the form as an independent adult, rather than a dependent. As a dependent, you would use your parents' income. As an independent adult, you'll use your income.
The federal government has eliminated some subsidized loans for graduate students, so you'll have fewer options than you did as an undergraduate.

Programs will focus on cultivating your communication skills, on preparing you to make tough decisions, and to organize teams. Oftentimes instruction in computer skills are important as well., Degrees in business administration are not just useful for the public sector; they can be equally as effective in helping you to organize departments in government or at universities. A degree in business administration is applicable to any job that requires active management of employees.


Examples include accountant, administrative executive, banker, chief executive officer, city manager, controller, consultant, department store manager, director, human resource manager, public relations specialist, retail manager, and school administrator., Each type of degree will qualify for better jobs, but it will also take time, and possibly a lot of money. If you feel that you have reached a dead end in your career and have the capacity and desire to do something more, consider going back for more education.


If your aspirations are entrepreneurial, you might want to reconsider getting an MBA or higher degree, because these can hinder your ability to develop the necessary capital to start your own business.The payoff of degrees past the bachelor’s level can also be highly contingent upon the rank of your university. If you aren’t qualified for a top-tier program, consider building some better credentials first., An associate degree usually will not get you a major management job in the financial industry. But it will qualify you for a management position in the service industry or middle management jobs in an office environment. An associate degree will also help you gain admittance into a bachelor’s program and may give you credits for such a program as well.


An associate degree will teach you all of the basics of management and might provide you some skills for specialized industries like health care administration and human resources., Most programs will require that you have a high school degree or equivalent: i.e. a GED. You will possibly also be required to have an SAT score.

, Most nearby community colleges should offer an associate degree in business administration. There are also an array of online programs for associate degrees. These will make it easier to attend if you are already in the middle of your career, however, not all such programs are credible.


To verify that the school you are interested in a credible ranking, research its accreditation. An accreditation by the Association of Advanced Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) is only available to programs with a strong record of scholarly research and is generally considered the gold standard. However, programs accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP) should also be of a reasonable standard., Some programs specialize in certain types of careers and are more appropriate for your objectives. Some are more flexible for part time students or offer more reasonable tuition. Consider all of these factors and pick three of four institutions that stand out for you.


Review the school’s website to see if they offer any specialized degrees in careers that you are interested. Look up the faculty biographies to see if they have experience or connections to fields that you are interested in.

, Once you’ve completed all of your requirements and found programs that you are interested in, apply. Try to apply to several programs, in case you get rejected.

, An associate degree will typically take two years. However, they should be flexible and it is possible that you could finish it either later or earlier than this, if that is the best option for your lifestyle.

, A bachelor’s is the standard in higher education. For a degree in business administration, you will required to understand general theories of business organization and, quite possibly, specialize in a particular field. Applicants with a bachelor’s in business administration will be considered eligible for a wide variety of occupations.

, A bachelor’s degree will take approximately four years of rigorous work. You will find it difficult to complete such a degree on a part time basis. Expect to dedicate four years of your life to the degree and apply to reputable programs that are likely to have more generous financial aid offerings.


Examples of careers available with a bachelor’s in business administration include: business analyst, human resources generalist, operations managers, or marketing specialists. A BA is typically also a good degree to begin your own entrepreneurial ventures with., Typically you will be required to have a high school degree or have passed the GRE. You will also need to have an SAT score. If you have received an associate degree, you can also include this in your application. This will demonstrate your commitment to higher education.

, US News and World Report ranks the top business schools in the country, including schools that are best for specific fields like Management or International Business.If you are interested in colleges that aren’t on this list, verify that they are accredited.


Preference should be given to business programs that are accredited by Association of Advanced Collegiate Schools of Business, but those accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs should also be reputable.

, It is important to cast a wide net to get into the best business program that you can. While sometimes there are factors that make it impossible to relocate or dedicate yourself to a full time degree, you should find the best bachelor’s program available to you. There is a huge discrepancy in the earning power of even top-tier bachelor’s programs.


The difference between the mid-career earnings of a student from the most lucrative business program (the University of California-Berkeley) and the fifteenth ranked program (the University of Southern California) is $37,000 per year. Not all programs are created equal., Expect to finish a core curriculum of business classes before beginning a specialization. Try to have a clear sense of what you want to do. Keep your grades up, because popular business programs are often “impacted” – that means you might be forced into a different major if you do not keep your grades up., The MBA is the most popular type of professional degree in the world.A master’s in business is a high level degree that prepares you for a variety of top-tier executive jobs. In most situations, an MBA is well qualified to be at the top of a business., A MBA is typically acquired mid-career program completed several years after your undergraduate degree. If you find that your career has stalled prematurely, you should consider an MBA. They are often friendly to those in the middle of their career, in that they are can be as short as one year, and might be possible to obtain part time.


Alternatively, some bachelor’s programs allow you to earn a MBA with an extra year of course work. This can often be the quickest and easiest way to get an MBA.Since the economic downturn, demand for MBA’s has decreased. Because of the expense of MBA programs it often is no longer valuable to get an MBA unless it comes from a top tier university., For a master’s degree you will need a bachelor’s degree in hand. You will also need to take one of two tests, either the GMAT or the GRE. For more exclusive programs, you often need to demonstrate several years of good job performance as well. You will need to write a statement of purpose demonstrating that you have the commitment and desire for the program.


Experience in the business world is essential to gaining admission to an MBA program. While undergraduate participation in business-related activities, such as internships or business fraternities, will help you gain admission, there is no substitute for full-time work in a business setting.
To demonstrate work experience you will typically be required to collect letters of recommendation.The GMAT is a standardized test required for admission to most MBA programs. It is administered by the Graduate Management Admissions Council several times throughout the year at several locations and costs $250.
Alternatively, some schools require a GRE, which is similar to the SAT.

, US News and World Reports ranks MBA’s according to specialties and even ranks part time programs.If you don’t have the credentials for these programs, consult the ACBSP for a list of other reputable MBA programs.

, Because many such programs are selective, try to apply to at least six. Having options will be valuable when you’re picking a program.

, Many factors should influence your decision. Some to consider include tuition, location, reputation, and flexibility. If you need to work during your program, seriously consider what part time options are available or how long the degree will be. Although two years is a standard time to graduation, some programs now offer one year degrees.


Research the earning power of graduates from the program. Many MBA’s are not as profitable as they used to be. You might find that the student loan debt required for the program is not worth the payoff., While similar, a Doctor of Business Administration is oriented toward the practical application of theory, while a PhD is focused on theoretical research and education.A DBA is reserved for high level executives who want to introduce new theories into their organization. The program will be three years on part time bass and will require an MBA. You should have approximately 15 years of management experience, half of which is on the executive level.The PhD on the other hand is 4-5 years, full time and does not require an MBA or work experience. The PhD is principally for people who want to teach business but can be for used by consultants or think tanks interested in abstract research., For both the DBA and the PhD you will be required to have a bachelor’s degree, and GMAT scores. The DBA will also require substantial several years of experience as an executive and an MBA. Those things are preferred for a PhD, but might not be required.

, Both a DBA and a PhD are highly specialized degrees. You will want to find faculty that specialize in your areas of interest. Research faculty that have published extensively on your field of interest. Contact them to discuss your work and whether they could advance your knowledge of the subject.

Take the Medical Licensure Board Exams The two medical licensure board examinations in the United States are the United States Medical Licensure Examination (USMLE) and the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination (COMLEX).,
Apply for residency.",How to Get a Medical Degree (USA)3," Orientation is there for a reason, and if you blow it off, you'll be missing important opportunities. Orientation provides you with a chance to meet professors and other students, see the facilities, and learn more about the school, the resources available to you, and the possibilities you have ahead.In addition, showing up for orientation is a good way to show you're excited about being there, and your professors will notice.

, It's best to understand what works best for you when it comes to studying before you start your medical degree. Once you start, you will need to hit the ground running because you will be expected to memorize information on an unprecedented level.Glean information from your time as an undergraduate student. For instance, decide whether you work best alone or in a group. Even if you work mostly alone, make sure to have friends on hand to rely on in a crisis.
Use any aids you can to help you, such as highlighters and flash cards. Make copies of everything that will help you, such as class presentations, and if possible, get previous exams from the classes to see what the professors tend to focus on. Make sure you are organized as possible, so you can find what you need when you need it.
Try to focus on studying as much information as you can, rather than going in depth with each topic.

, You don't need to pick a specialty before you enter medical school, though if you already know what you want to specialize in, that may influence your choice of schools; however, you can take the first year to begin explore the world of medicine, getting an idea of what piques your interest.By the second year, you should be focusing in on several interests to see which one you like best. You can join specialty groups at your school, or you can go to physician panels to hear about different specialties.
You can also talk to physicians who are working in the field to learn more about different areas.
When choosing your specialty, think about your own skills and personality, as well as the environment you'll be working in and the kind of work you'll be doing. For instance, if you don't like a high-stress environment, you might want to stay out of emergency medicine.
It is helpful to choose a specialty early, but it's also important you are confident in your decision and it's something you know you will stick with.

, In year one, your schooling will be mostly class-based, and you'll take classes such as gross anatomy, histology, pathology, and biochemistry. You'll also be required to do labs connected to these classes.Gross anatomy is the study of anatomy, while biochemistry is closer to organic chemistry. Histology is focused on the cells in the human body, and pathology is where you study specific diseases.
By second year, most of your classes will be clinic-based, and in the third and fourth years, you'll move on to clinical rotations.

, In your third and fourth years, you begin clinical rotations, meaning you'll actually be working in a clinic or hospital, assisting a doctor, resident, or intern. Before you start your rotations, try to familiarize yourself as much as possible with the clinic you'll be working in.Ask upperclassmen for tips. They know the ins and outs of the clinics you'll be working in and can give you a sense of the environment of the clinic.
Make sure you know what kinds of charts you'll be using, whether paper or computerized, and what access you will have to them.
Focus on learning. While doing your clinical rotations, your main focus should be learning patient care. Observe how other doctors and nurses interact with patients, and take mental (and physical) notes on how you can use that information in the future.
Be the expert on what patients you have. When you're assigned to work under someone on certain patients, make sure you know everything you possibly can about their condition and other health problems. Read up on them when you can.

, The USMLE is required for licensure for medical students completing a Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree and the COMLEX is required for medical students completing a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO) degree; taking the USMLE is also available for DO medical students and many do sit for both examinations. These exams are actually multi-part tests that you take over the course of your medical degree. You must pass all the parts to practice as a doctor, though you can retake portions as needed.For instance, Level or Step 1 is taken after your second year, and it focuses on what you've been learning in your first two years, such as biochemistry, pathology, and anatomy. It consists of 280 questions. You spend eight hours taking the test, though it's broken into one-hour chunks.Level or Step 2 is divided into two parts, Step 2 CK (clinical knowledge) and Step 2 CS (clinical skills), and is usually taken in your fourth year. Step 2 CK covers clinical science, specifically the skills you need to care for a patient, while Step 2 CS covers your communication abilities and how well you are able to connect with a patient. Each of these two steps is a one-day exam.Step 2 CK has 355 questions, spread out in 60-minute blocks.Step 2 CS is a practical exam, where you engage with ""patients"" to see whether you can perform an appropriate examination.Step 3 is a two-day exam, and its purpose is to decide whether you are ready to apply your knowledge in an unsupervised environment. Generally, you take it during residency, after you graduate.You will have about 233 multiple-choice questions on the first day, divided into 1-hour blocks. On the second day, you'll have approximately 180 multiple-choice questions, as well as 13 case studies., While you're still in school, you'll apply for residency. When you apply for residency, you apply in the area you want to specialize in, so your skills should be a good match. It's now that your chosen specialty from earlier in your schooling comes into play.Much like applying for medical school, you'll also need to write a personal statement when applying for residency. You'll need to convince the hospital, doctor, or school why you're a good fit for that particular area.
Study hard for Steps 1 and 2 of the USMLE and/or COMLEX exams, as they can affect your competitiveness for residency. Medical students are often ranked by these scores.

Learn your local requirements.,
Identify what type of nursing you want to do.",How to Get a Degree in Nursing1," Different levels of education will qualify you for different nursing jobs, duties, and careers. For example, becoming a registered nurse (RN) only requires an associate degree whereas becoming a nurse practitioner may require a master's degree in nursing. If you already have a degree in another subject, you can choose to get a second bachelor's or a diploma.If you already have a bachelor’s degree in another field, you can complete a diploma course. These courses offer an accelerated program to nursing, although they do not qualify you for the more specialized jobs.
An associate degree in nursing (ADN) will take two years to complete, and the coursework must be done at a state-approved training program or school. It is cheaper and faster to complete than a bachelor’s degree.
A Bachelor’s of Science in Nursing (BSN) will require four years of coursework at an accredited university. A BSN will open the door to more job opportunities and higher salaries. There are accelerated programs available at some schools for those who already have a bachelor’s degree.
A Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) is required for some more specialized fields of nursing. You might consider this after a few years of working in the field.;
, Different countries and localities have different requirements for becoming a nurse. To understand which degree and qualifications you need, you should look in both your national and local licensing procedures for nurses.


In the US, you will need a nursing diploma, an associate degree, or a bachelor's degree. Further requirements vary by state. Refer to the American Nurses Association for more information.
In the UK, you will need to complete a bachelor's degree in nursing.

Choosing classes that relate to your future career and getting the best grades possible is an excellent way to start.Take as many science classes as you can in high school, especially AP classes. The more fundamental knowledge you have, the better prepared you will be for college-level classes.
Don't neglect your other classes in favor of science classes. It's important to be well-rounded and have good grades in all your courses.
A high GPA and good SAT or ACT scores will improve your chances of being accepted into an excellent undergraduate program, which will in turn prepare you for the graduate program that you want to pursue.
You can also use your high school years as an opportunity to shadow professional physical therapists. Reach out to offices in your area and try to find a therapist who would be willing to let you observe their daily routine. This will give you a good idea of what it is really like to be a physical therapist.;
, In order to be accepted into a doctoral program in physical therapy, you will first need to complete an undergraduate degree. All doctoral programs have different prerequisite requirements, so it's a good idea to review the requirements at several schools before choosing your undergraduate major. In general, you will be required to take undergraduate courses in science fields such as biology, chemistry, anatomy, and physiology.Especially relevant majors include biology, kinesiology, and exercise science, although you may have other options as well, depending on what programs are offered at your undergraduate school and what graduate school you hope to attend.
If you are still in high school and you are certain that you want to pursue a doctorate degree in physical therapy, you may want to look into applying to a guaranteed admission program. These programs admit students as college freshmen for a six-year program that encompasses an undergraduate degree and a doctorate degree without the need to apply separately for the doctoral program., Most reputable DPT programs are highly competitive, and undergraduate GPAs are heavily weighed by graduate program admissions officers, so it is extremely important to keep your grades as high as possible. Stay focused on your goals throughout your undergraduate years and maintain the highest GPA possible.If you are struggling with your undergraduate classes, get help as soon as possible. Talk to your professors about what you can do to improve your grades or find out if there are peer tutoring services available at your university.
Avoid overloading yourself with classes as an undergraduate if it causes your grades to slip. For example, if you can maintain a 3.6 GPA while taking 15 credits, but only a 3.2 while taking 18 credits, it may be wise to stick to the 15-credit course load.

, Having some kind of experience in the physical therapy field or a closely related field can greatly improve your chances of being admitted to a doctoral program. You can gain experience by getting a part-time job, completing an internship program, or even volunteering.Many programs will require that you complete observation hours before a DPT program. If this is required for the program that you will be applying for, make the most of this experience! Try to form a good relationship with the physical therapists you shadow, as you will probably need them to write recommendation letters for you.In addition to helping you get into a doctoral program, gaining experience at the undergraduate level will also help you confirm that you enjoy working in the field, and it also may help you choose a specialty that you wish to pursue.
Having experience in multiple settings may be even more beneficial, so seek out as many relevant opportunities as possible.

, The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is a test that is required for admission to most graduate programs, including DPT programs. Scores are valid for five years, so you can take it any time during your undergraduate studies. Be sure to prepare for this test and do as well as you can, as GRE scores are heavily weighed by admissions officers.The GRE is a standardized test that consists of three sections: verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and analytical writing.Check online to find out what GRE scores you will need to be accepted into various DPT programs. Many schools post this information on their websites. If they don't post a minimum required score, they may post the average score of accepted applicants.
You can retake the GRE if your score is not as high as you hoped it would be. The earlier you take the exam, the more chances you will have to retake it before you have to submit your applications to DPT programs.
When you take the GRE, you can select to have your scores automatically sent to the schools that you plan on applying to. If you don't do this before you take the test, you will need to contact the company that administers the exam to have your scores sent to each school.

, In general, it's a good idea to apply to several different DPT programs, as admissions are typically very competitive. Before applying, take a look at the admissions requirements online. If you are unsure if you will be accepted into the programs that you are most interested in, consider applying to several ""safe"" schools with less stringent admissions requirements as well.When looking at schools, it is extremely important to ensure that they are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE). In order to sit for the exam that is required to obtain a license to practice physical therapy, you will need to graduate from an accredited program.Some factors to consider when selecting the right school for you are graduation and employment rates, location, cost, and program size.

, Most applications will require that you write at least one essay. Even if writing is not your strong point, be sure to take your time and write quality essays. Always read the requirements carefully to make sure that you answer all aspects of the question that is being asked and adhere to the required word count.If you are asked to write essays on different topics for different schools, make sure your essay really fits the topic. Don't just tweak an essay that you used for another application if it doesn't fit!
The most important thing you need to convey in your essays is a passion for the field of physical therapy. It's important that everyone who reads your essays understand why you want to pursue this career path instead of something else.
If you have any doubts about the grammatical correctness of your essays, have them checked by a trusted friend or a professional editor. Your essays should be as polished as possible!

, Letters of recommendation are also a very important component of your application. Each program will have specific requirements for letters of recommendation, but they should generally come from college professors and/or professionals in the physical therapy field.Ask professors who can speak to your ability to excel in a science-heavy curriculum and hands-on work with patients. The better the professors know you, the better their recommendation letters will be, so take some time to forge relationships with some of your professors.
You may also need to obtain at least one letter of recommendation from a licensed physical therapist. This can be an individual that you shadowed during your observation hours, or an individual who you worked for in another capacity. These letters should highlight your aptitude for the field of physical therapy.

, Once you have gathered all of the required materials, complete the application for each DPT program that you wish to apply for. Most programs now use The Physical Therapy Centralized Application Service's online application, which makes it easy to apply to multiple programs.Be sure to submit all required documents before the application deadline. This includes transcripts, letters of recommendation, GRE scores, and any other documentation requested by the program.
If there are multiple application deadlines, try to submit your application before the first deadline, as this may increase your chances of being accepted.

, Some programs interview you in person to gauge your capacity for grasping the curriculum and working with people in a healthcare setting. If you are asked to attend an interview, use this as another opportunity to convey your passion for the field of physical therapy to the admissions committee.


Even if you don't have an interview, it's a good idea to visit each school that you are interested in and talk with the faculty. This will give you a much better idea of which school is the best fit for you., Once you've applied to DPT programs, you will need to wait for your decision letters before making any further plans. If you are only accepted into one program, you will have an easy decision, but if you are accepted into multiple programs, you will need to carefully consider which is the best fit for you.


There are three possible outcomes of an application to a DPT program: you may be accepted outright, you may be rejected outright, or you may be wait-listed. If you are wait-listed, this means that you will be given a spot in the program only if enough of the accepted candidates decline their offers. You may have to wait some time to find out if you are accepted into these programs.If you didn't get into any programs, don't give up! You may want to consider spending the next year gaining more clinical experience, and then applying to different programs.

, Most DPT programs take three years to complete. As a doctoral student, you can expect to spend about 80% of your time in the classroom and laboratory studying topics such as biology, physiology, behavioral sciences, finance, ethics, and sociology, and various evidence-based practices. It's a good idea to work closely with your academic adviser to plan out your coursework.

, In addition to classroom work, you will be required to complete clinical fieldwork, which will constitute approximately 20% of your study time. This fieldwork will give you the opportunity to work with patients in a clinical setting under the supervision of licensed physical therapists. Each program has its own set of requirements.During your fieldwork, you will essentially be an intern, working in a clinical setting such as a hospital or private office under the supervision of a licensed physical therapist. You will both observe your mentor and be observed as you interact with and treat patients.
You may be required to present a case study report based on a specific case that you encountered during your fieldwork.

, In addition to learning about the science behind physical therapy, you will need to learn how to interact with patients in order to be a successful physical therapist. Use your field work during graduate school as an opportunity to improve your communication skills.


You will need to be especially careful about explaining things to your patients in ways that they can understand. Using too much industry jargon will only confuse them.Consider asking your fellow students or supervisors for feedback on how you can improve the way that you interact with patients. Practice makes perfect, so do your best to implement their suggestions every day.
If you struggle with interacting with patients, you may want to consider taking some additional courses. Studying sociology, psychology, or communications may help.

, After you complete your doctoral program, the first step towards obtaining a license to practice physical therapy is to pass the NPTE. This is a computer-based multiple-choice exam that will test you on your knowledge of the practice of physical therapy.If you do not pass the NPTE the first time, you may take it up to three times per year until you pass.

, Each state in the United States sets its own requirements for obtaining a license to practice physical therapy. After you pass the NPTE, you may need to take some additional steps in order to obtain the license. Check with your state for more details.You may have to take additional exams beyond the NPTE. These exams may include questions about the laws that are specific to the practice of physical therapy in your state.
You may also have to pass a criminal background check in order to be granted a license.
Many states also require that physical therapists complete continuing education requirements in order to renew their licenses.

, If you want to gain even more knowledge and skills beyond what you acquired during your DPT program, you may choose to pursue a clinical residency or fellowship program. These programs are designed for licensed physical therapists who wish to develop their knowledge in a specific area of clinical practice.Residency programs allow physical therapists to continue practicing under the guidance and mentorship of more experienced physical therapists. Fellowship programs include classroom instruction in addition to clinical work.

, Once you are licensed, you will also have the option to pursue board certification in a sub-specialty of physical therapy. This is not a requirement to be a licensed physical therapist, but it can help you earn respect in your field and gain more specific knowledge.Specialty areas include geriatrics, pediatrics, orthopedics, pulmonary and cardiovascular, women's health, neurology, clinical electrophysiology, and sports physical therapy.

, If you want to continue growing your career and learning more about the field of physical therapy, it's important to stay connected to other industry professionals. There are many different ways to stay in the know, so take advantage of them.


You can join professional organizations, such as the American Physical Therapy Association, which will help you stay up-to-date on the latest industry trends.You can subscribe to industry publications to stay informed. These may focus on a specific specialty of physical therapy or be more general, and many are available online for easy access.You may also wish to attend periodic conferences for physical therapists. This will give you the opportunity to learn about what other professionals in the field are doing and to network.

Stir in a splash of brandy (optional).,
Serve warm.",How to Make Mulled Wine," Toast your spices in a dry pan over medium heat until they brown lightly and release fragrance, or for one or two minutes.Besides improving their aroma, dry roasting tends to make spices more mellow and complex. The exact flavor change depends on the spice.Whether or not you toast the spices is a matter of taste, so feel free to experiment.


Do not toast wet ingredients such as citrus or raw ginger.;
, This makes it easy to remove the spices when it's time to pour the wine. Alternatively, just add them to the pot loose and pour the wine through a strainer before serving.


You can also stick the cloves into the skin of a whole orange or other citrus fruit to make a traditional, decorative infuser.

, Wine and other acidic ingredients can pick up potentially harmful amounts of metal from aluminum, copper, and cast iron, or corrode the protective coating on some cookware. It's best to use less reactive options such as stainless steel, anodized aluminum, or nonstick materials, especially if you cook with wine often., Slice one orange and one lemon directly into the pot, or add only the juice and zest, discarding the rest. The second option allows you to avoid bitter flavors from the white pith, so make sure to zest only the colorful outer skin.Dry fruit is another nice addition to mulled wine. If you happen to have dried apricots, cherries, sultanas, or prunes, toss in a small handful., Mulling will cover up nuanced flavors, so there's no point using the good stuff. A cheap, fairly dry red is a good choice. Fruity flavors should be prominent, with no strong oak or tannic components that could turn the brew bitter.Try Cabernet Sauvignon, Bordeaux, or Pinot Noir.You can mull white wine, but it works better with lighter flavors, such as vanilla and elderflower cordial., Start with ½ cup (100g) granulated or raw sugar. If you have a sweet tooth or your wine is particularly dry, you can always add more at the end after taste testing.


Replace the sugar with maple syrup for a richer flavor that complements the ginger, cinnamon, and other spicy flavors.

, Heat the pan over low heat until it steams and reaches a low simmer. Heat for about ten minutes, stirring occasionally until all the sugar has dissolved in the wine.


Cover half the pan to speed up this process.

, The wine still needs more time to infuse, but high heat may scorch it and produce unpleasant flavors. Keep it on low heat for the rest of the process.


Some cooks even take the pan off heat at this point and leave it, covered, to infuse while cooling slowly.If you do this, warm the wine up again before serving.

, Taste the wine after another 10 minutes to see whether the flavors have infused. If the wine tastes harsh or weakly flavored, continue simmering until it mellows out and takes on the flavors of spice and citrus.


Do not simmer for more than one hour total., An uncovered pot of wine will typically lose about 40% of its alcohol in half an hour of simmering.If you want to restore that boozy punch, add 3 tablespoons (45mL) of chest-warming brandy to the pot.


Alcohol will boil away more quickly in a wide pot with more surface area.

, Serve in thick, heatproof glasses or small mugs. Decorate with extra cinnamon sticks, star anise, or orange slices studded with cloves.


Mulled wine is best served immediately, but can keep for a day or two in the refrigerator. Reheat before serving.

, It might be helpful to create a map of the courses you need to take over the course of your program. For each semester in your nursing course, you can mark which required courses you will take so that you can complete your degree on time. Refer to your school’s course catalogue to see which courses are available during certain semesters.


Many programs have a set course map because certain classes have to be taken in a certain order, and certain ones are only offered during the spring, summer, or fall — not every semester.
Some programs might offer the opportunity to take extra courses in the summer, online, or at night. If you want to complete your degree early, talk to an advisor about these options.

Many of these organizations aim to support you through the training process while providing resources that can connect you to jobs after your degree. Some large societies include:


National Student Nurses’ AssociationChi Eta Phi SororityNational Association of Hispanic NursesNational Black Nurses Association, Known in some places as practice placements, clinical training gives you firsthand experience in hospital wards.Here you will be taught the skills you need to be a good nurse. Even if you plan to use your nursing degree to pursue a career in administrative duties, you will still have to complete intensive clinical training.


Requirements for clinical training vary by region. In general, a clinical rotation is meant to take up at least 40% of your program's length.You may be required to fill out a request for placement form and a HIPAA form before you begin. HIPAA states that you will protect patient privacy during your rotations., Once you have completed your course work and your clinical rotation, you will be ready to graduate. To become a registered nurse, you will still have to fulfill national and regional licensing requirements, such as exams or registration with a nursing board.


In the US, you will take the National Council Licensing Examination (NCLEX) after receiving your degree. This examination is given by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing.If you trained in the UK, you will need to register with the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). You can apply on their website. You will have to provide proof of graduation and declare any criminal convictions.Canada’s requirements vary by province, but in general, you must register with the province’s nursing board.

Keep in mind that saffron comes in three different ways.,
Check the colour of the saffron.,
Smell the saffron.,
Decide between threads and powder.,
Store saffron properly.",How to Choose Saffron," These are:


Saffron threads

Saffron tips; and
Saffron powder.;
, High quality saffron threads will appear dark red - the redder, the better. There should be no colour variation. If the yellow style can be viewed, it means that it hasn't been removed and while it has no culinary benefit, it certainly adds to the weight.However, few producers will go to that extra effort, so it's probably best to get used to it.


Powdered saffron is harder to discern with colour and it is the easiest form of saffron to adulterate. It will look a little lighter in colour than the saffron threads or tips. If it comes from a reputable brand or merchant, it should be fine.

, It should smell sweet, with a floral-type aroma.

, There are different ways of using these, so the choice will really depend on your own preference, and you may even like to have both available in your pantry.


Threads: These can be separated out one by one and used decoratively. Chefs like the fact that you can tell it's a saffron thread on a dish.Saffron powder: This doesn't require steeping and is easy to add with a pinch.

, Place it into a glass jar and keep it in a cool, dark, and dry place.

You are close when the milk starts to steam. Keep heating and stirring it until it bubbles. Let it cool to 110°F (45°C)., Cut the butter into smaller pieces first, so that it melts faster. Add it to the scalded milk and give it a stir. Keep stirring until the butter melts. Set the milk and butter mixture aside so that it can cool., If you have not already, heat some water to 110°F (45°C). Pour it into a mixing bowl, then add the yeast and sugar. Give the mixture a stir., It is ready when it starts to turn creamy and bubbly., By now, the scaled milk should have cooled down to room temperature. Pour it slowly into the yeast mixture, and give everything a stir., Add the eggs in first. Give the mixture a brief stir to mix them in, then add in the granulated sugar, salt, and nutmeg.

It is best if you use freshly-ground nutmeg. If you can't get any nutmeg to grind freshly, you can use the store-bought kind.

, Pour in 1 cup (100 grams) of flour, and give the batter a stir with a rubber spatula. Keep adding in the flour, 1 cup (100 grams) at a time, stirring after each addition. At the very end, stir in the final ½ cup (50 grams) of flour., Spread some flour across a flat, smooth surface. Turn the dough out onto the flour. Start kneading and turning the dough.

Try to cover the rectangles as evenly as you can, from edge to edge., Pick up one of the long edges of your first rectangle. Start rolling it towards the other end to form a tight, 16-inch (40-centimeter) long tube. Repeat this step for the other rectangle as well., Bring both ends of your tube together to form a ring. Overlap them slightly and run your fingers over the seam to seal it. Transfer the ring to the baking sheet and shape it into an oval. Repeat this step for the other tube and baking sheet., Use a pair of scissors to cut slits ⅓ of the way deep into the rings. Leave about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of space between each slit. This will give the cakes some texture and make them more crown-like., This should take about 45 more minutes. Remember to keep it some place warm and not too cold., If your oven is small, you will need to bake the cakes on two separate racks. Halfway through the baking, switch the racks that the cakes are on. This way, they will bake evenly., You don't have to do this, but it's what makes the cake traditional. The person who finds the plastic baby typically has to host the next party. Some traditions say that he or she has to make the next cake.

If you can't find a baby figurine, or don't want to use one, try an orange wedge or a pecan half instead. They are edible and less likely to hurt someone's teeth!, If you want to, you can use a cardboard cake platter instead. Gold would go especially well with the Mardi Gras theme, and even more so considering that this is a King's cake., Pour 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of warm water into a mixing bowl. Stir in the powdered sugar. Keep stirring until all of the water is absorbed and the powdered sugar turns fluid.

The icing should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. If it's too thick or too dry, add another tablespoon (15 milliliters) of water.

, Use a soup or sauce ladle to scoop up the icing and pour it in a thick, generous layer onto the cake. Avoid getting any icing in the empty middle, however!, Try to sprinkle the sugar on in even bands of purple, green, and gold. The bands can be as thick or as thin as you'd like. You can use a thick, generous sprinkling of sugar or just a delicate dusting.

If you can't find any gold sugar, use yellow instead.

These nurseries will often have experts who can answer any questions you have. Ask around to find the best nurseries in your area.Home improvement stores and other big chains often focus on just providing the cheapest price. Sometimes their quality can be hit-or-miss.;
, Another good option is ordering a mint plant through the mail. You can still get high-quality plants, and you'll have a larger selection of varieties., Mint is easy to grow from a cutting even without roots. When you purchase mint, leave a cutting in a glass of water. Make sure it gets some sun, and it will grow roots. You can then plant it., Mint grows well from a cutting, so if you know someone who has a mint plant, you can simply ask for one. Most gardeners are more than happy to part with a cutting, as mint needs to be thinned often.

The stems may might not look as green as they should, and they may be deformed., You don't want to buy a plant that's infested with pests, as they could kill your plant. Mint is susceptible to spider mites, flea beetles, and root weevils, to name a few. Check the leaves, stem, and soil to see if you notice an infestation.Also, if you run your hand over the plant, notice if small flying insects appear, which is another bad sign., You can plant mint in the ground, but it is very aggressive. It can take over other parts of your garden. A pot helps keep the mint contained. However, make sure you buy a pot that gives your mint room to grow.You only need a single plant in your pot, as it will spread out a good deal., When choosing a location, pick one with the most sun you can find. Of course, you'll need to make sure the soil doesn't dry out. However, partial shade is also suitable for growing mint., When choosing a potting soil, look for one that has pH between 6 and 7, which mint likes best. However, mint is not too particular, and it will grow in many soils. Also, add a bit of mulch on top, which will help create a moist soil that mint loves."

Freshen up.",How to Use Kaffir Lime Leaves," If living in a suitable Mediterranean climate, you can grow your own kaffir lime tree. If not, leaves and limes can be obtained in fresh and a dried form from Asian grocery stores and specialty grocery stores in many countries.;
, Kaffir lime leaves may be used fresh or dried, depending on the recipe or usage. Importantly:


The leaves should be used whole when simmering in soups and curries, and may be shredded for use in fish cakes or similar dishes. The leaf is rarely eaten; the one exception is when it is shredded extremely finely, such as for Tod Mun (fried fish cake).Fresh, tender young leaves are the preferred choice for salads; do not use dried kaffir leaves in salads.The midrib and stalk may be bitter in older leaves; if this bitterness bothers you, tear the leaf and remove these parts for cooking, including simmering.

, Kaffir lime leaves are perfect for adding flavour to Asian cuisine. They are highly aromatic and add their own elegant flavour to stir-fry, curry, salad and fish cake dishes. Some examples for use include:


Thai curry dishes and soups, such as Tom Yum
Indonesian curry dishes
Thai fish cakes, e.g., Tod Mun and steamed fish dishes, e.g., Haw Moak
Asian bouquet garni - make up with kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass and ginger as the bouquet garni ingredients and use to flavour stock
Krueng - a paste using Kaffir lime leaves as the base
Flavour rice - When cooking your rice, especially jasmine rice, throw in a few leaves. The flavour will be imparted to the rice.
Add to a marinade - suitable for chicken, pork or lamb dishes.
Make a syrup - add a kaffir lime leaf to sugar overnight and use the sugar to make a syrup the next day.
Use Kaffir lime leaves in hot and sour shrimp soup. Dry the leaves under direct sunlight; this will bring out more aroma than using fresh leaves. Put the leaves in the soup for about 1 minute before you finish making it.

Store in water away from direct sunlight.,
Prepare the basil for freezing.,
Freeze the basil by starting a pesto sauce.,
Freeze the basil as is.,
Freeze the basil using a milk carton.,
Hopefully you will try one (or all) of these easy ways to freeze basil.",How to Store Fresh Basil," If you don't want to freeze the basil, whether it's homegrown or purchased, you can keep it fresh for up to two weeks by placing the branches in a vase and keeping them on the counter out of the sun. This method is ideal when you're likely to be using it frequently for cooking throughout the following week or so.









It's recommended that you keep the basil close to your cooking preparation area to make it easier to remember to make use of it.;
, Clean and dry the basil:









First, remove all leaves from the stems. If you're going to try out the second freezing method, then you will probably want to leave some of the buds intact. The stems should be discarded.
Rinse the leaves thoroughly, taking care not to bruise them.
Finally, remove excess water from the leaves by using a salad spinner or laying them out on towels to dry.

, Place 1 or 2 handfuls of the basil in your food processor, then chop or purée the basil leaves with extra virgin olive oil and a bit of salt. Coating the basil pieces with oil protects them from air so they can maintain their color and flavor. Pour the purée into small air-tight containers and add some extra olive oil on top. After defrosting the purée, re-process adding your favorite pesto ingredients.








, This method takes a little more time, but is still an easy way to freeze basil. This method keeps whole individual leaves or plant buds intact to use as garnish.









Put prepared leaves and buds on trays in the freezer for about one to two hours.
Once they are frozen, put them into airtight containers. Do not overcrowd them; otherwise they will lose their shape.
After defrosting for use, you can julienne the leaves or use them whole as garnish on pasta dishes or soups.

, This method is the easiest of all the freezing methods.









Simply pack the leaves into a cleaned out milk carton with the top cut down.
Seal the top closed.
Use quart (950ml) sized cartons and then put the sealed carton inside a Ziploc baggy to make it air-tight.
When you want to use the basil for cooking, cut off a slice of the carton and re-store the remainder as it was. The frozen leaves are great to use in sauces.

, By taking time to store basil after a fall harvest or an indoor harvest, you can enjoy the fresh basil flavors throughout the year. Happy cooking!

Know the difference between an herb and a spice.,
Explore the different flavour profiles of spices and consider how you can blend them or ally them with other ingredients to boost their flavour or make a meal more tasty.,
Consider how spices will taste in conjunction to other ingredients.,
Discover how the profile of spices can change when processed.,
Aim to purchase your spices whole if possible.,
Learn how to ""toast"" spices.,
If you enjoy grinding your spices, invest in a large mortar and pestle.,
Learn how compound spices work in recipes.,
Store spices in a dry, cool place.,
Start cooking more with spices.,
Continue to explore your own tastes for spice.",How to Use Spices in Cookery," A spice is usually defined as the seeds or pods (caraway, cardamom), flower or flower heads and stigmas (saffron), buds (cloves), aromatic berries (peppercorns), fruits (paprika), roots (ginger), stems or bark (cinnamon) and other parts of a plant. A herb is usually designated as the fragrant leaf and occasionally the green stems of a plant if it is young or has no woody stems (parsley, rosemary, basil, etc.).A number of plants are both herb and spice. For example, coriander (or cilantro) leaf is an herb, but the stems, flowers, seeds or roots of the same plant is typically referred to as a spice.;
, Different spices have different characteristics, with some having more than one virtue. Here are some of the qualities by way of example:


Some are earthy (such as cumin, turmeric etc).
Some are spicy such as ginger, turmeric, or chillies, wasabi, mustard, pepper and Szechwan peppers and give a warming sensation, and have powerful anti-inflammatory effects. Some are floral or sweet (such as vanilla, star anise, rose petals, etc).
Some add colour (such as saffron).
There are many more spice flavouring qualities such as sourness, bitterness, an ability to make other flavours more complex and fragrant etc.

, For example sweet spices typically go well with sweet things, such as nutmeg, cloves, vanilla, cinnamon, cardamon, allspice in cakes, cookies, stewed fruits etc so we normally classify them as a sweet spice. But tastes and fashions change and sweet can go with typically savoury things, such as in stews, braises & roast vegetables (especially sweet potato) and curries that use sweet spices in what is typically a savoury meal. There is no sugar added which makes the spice able to work for sweet dishes and savoury dishes.


The advantage with modern spice blends is they are made ahead for convenience, but the disadvantage is it can be hard to adjust them to your taste without some experience with spices. If you have not ever made a spice blend from scratch, or have experimented with spices before it can be very hard to correct or modify a dish should it not taste good, or not taste as good as it could do. The additional key benefit is sometimes a meal may be planned, but when a problem happens, such as an ingredient has passed its use-by date, or the dish does not turn out as planned, the use of spices can make the failed meal into an entirely different (and successful) meal.

, Garlic for example if slowly roasted whole in the skin is quite mild and sweet, but raw finely minced garlic is quite spicy. If it's ""steeped"" such as in a stew or broth, it can be quite rich in flavour, but it is very acrid if burnt.


Some spices require grinding, some can be bashed roughly, some turn out more pungent when grated. It varies per type of spice, as some spices don't taste as good if they're not prepared quite right. Most dried spices tend to be ideal ground to a powder.
Some are better, or are different flavour when fresh, some are better dried (such as vanilla, cloves - which are a flower bud, paprika, etc).
By knowing which spices are similar as well as their individual uses, it can be quite easy to substitute with a similar spice, or to create new spice mixes to your taste.

, This sometimes is a lot more expensive (such as vanilla beans, rather than vanilla paste or extracts) or fresh ginger etc, but sometimes it is marginal such as cinnamon sticks, whole seeds and spices such as cumin, fennel, cloves, star anise or coriander seeds. It does make a large difference to the quality of the meal and whole chunky spices (such as star anise or cinnamon sticks) can always be removed prior to serving.


This is because pre-ground spices tend to have a lot more surface area exposed to air so their essential oils or flavouring compounds are lost more easily. The also can be degraded due to exposure to bright light in supermarkets if they have been stored for some time. This means the spices are often stale, even when new. The rule of thumb is if any spice smells dull and not fresh, then it is stale and is not worth using. Grinding your own spices is a joyful experience in itself.
Whole spices work best in dishes that are slowly simmered (some spices turn bitter after prolonged cooking, so slow cooking is important). Ground spices are easy to add to a dish at any stage of the cooking process.

, This is known as ""dry-frying"". Much like toasting nuts, this process activates the flavour and perfumes which make the spice release more of its aroma and flavour, making the dish far more flavoursome.


The method is simple but it is a skill you need to learn. Warm a pan on low heat and add your spices, warming gently until they become fragrant, stirring often. Many fresh spice pastes are better to be cooked wet (in oil, butter, ghee etc), where dry spices are more likely to burn this way. Avoid burning the spices at all costs as their flavours can be very undesirable. The moment they smell fragrant, remove them from the heat - its not always evident by looking at them, but the scent is the key.

, These are actually cheaper at international grocery stores, rather than those found in the larger department stores. Choose a mortar (being the bowl part of the pair) that will hold enough dried or fresh spices that you need for your meal and can be crushed without overflowing. A 2-3 cup volume is desirable as a small 1 cup is fine for very small use strong spices such as cloves.


Another handy tool is an electric spice grinder, or a coffee or nut grinder used solely for spices. You could even try a chocolate mill and for nutmegs, look for a nutmeg grinder or mill.

, Quite often spices are grouped together and usually a ""mother spice"" serves as the main flavour vehicle (such as fennel, paprika or coriander/cilantro, etc). The main spice is then tempered or modified with the addition of other spices to give it a more desirable tone of flavour and to build a specific spice mix. There are a lot of spice blend recipes online and in books so it is highly recommended to make them from scratch more often than from a powdered mix so you can create your own spice blends and become more familiar with them. There are many hundreds of spice blends worldwide, but some good common examples are:


A curry powder is a typical compound spice as it has several typical spices (such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, etc) but it varies a lot in type. Some curry blends are common and some are regional or specialised, such as including or omitting spices such as ginger, asafetida, nutmeg, mustard, kencur root, etc.

Ras el Hanout is another well known compound spice blend, used frequently for many north African & middle eastern dishes.
""Quatre Epices"" (Four Spices) is a classical French compound spice. This is typically made up from cloves, ground pepper (white or black or a combination), ginger and nutmeg. This variation sometimes swaps one of the spices for cinnamon or allspice so it does vary from region to region.

, Spices can be stored direct in airtight jars, but preferably they should be used up within half a year from purchase as they can turn stale quickly. Smell them before use to gauge freshness, should the spices smell be muted, dusty or mouldy (providing they did not smell that way when fresh), they should be disposed of even if they look okay as they may not flavour the dish as you would intend.


Fresh spice pastes, or newly made dried spice mixes can be frozen for longer storage, but are best stored in air-tight containers (preferably a container within a container) as their scent could permeate the smaller freezer space and taint other foods.

, Now that you've had a chance to explore spices and learn how to find, store, improve, and savor them, begin introducing more of them into your cooking. Here are a few suggestions that are a tip of the spice iceberg:


Fragrant spice dishes: Pumpkin coriander filo parcels, Coriander relish, caraway cakes, cauliflower with tomato and cumin sauce, hare with prunes and juniper berries, saffron potatoes, Cumin & Sesame Roasted Potatoes and so forth.
Intense spice dishes: Apple strudel with allspice, Jamaican jerks seasoning with allspice, fenugreek herbs with mushrooms, galangal and mint raita, bechamel sauce with mace, za'atar with sumac, roasted paprika almonds, and so forth.
Hot spice dishes: Cayenne pepper, green chilli/chile quiche, fried potatoes with mustard seeds, freshly ground pepper, five spice powder with sichuan pepper, wasabi mashed potatoes, and so forth.
Sweet spice dishes: Fried cardamom cookies, cinnamon rolls, cinnamon toast, cinnamon hot chocolate, crystallised ginger, Armenian nutmeg cake, hot chocolate with star anise, real vanilla bean ice cream, vanilla custard, and so forth.
Blended spice dishes: Tomato chermoula, fish curry, choko curry, curried walnuts, five spice powder, ras el hanout spice blend, panch phora, za'atar, chicken tikka with garam masala, mixed spice, spicy mocha mix, spicy relish, and so forth.

, While it's best to follow a recipe until you're more confident (especially as spices can easily be overpowering), as you become more adept at understanding how the spices fit well with other flavours, begin experimenting with your own dishes. The web has a great source of places to explore spices and there is a great array of different and international spice blends just waiting to be experimented with.

Add nutmeg as a drink topper.",How to Select and Use Nutmeg," The nutmeg is the inside part of a yellow fruit from the nutmeg tree, namely the kernel.The ripened fruit splits open to reveal a hard, black nutmeg. This nutmeg is dried for culinary usage. Mace is the inner case of the nutmeg and looks like webbing. Mace has a more delicate taste than nutmeg.;
, There are two ways to purchase nutmeg.


The more common way is to purchase it pre-ground in glass, plastic or cardboard containers for ready sprinkling. Nutmeg purchased in this way should be used quickly to get the best flavour, as the flavour deteriorates over time in contact with the air and aromas of the kitchen.
The preferred method for the sake of ensuring excellent aromatic, spicy and nutty flavour is to purchase the nutmeg in its whole state.You will need to own a nutmeg grinder/mill or nutmeg grater in order to be able to grate the nutmeg; some companies sell the nutmeg in a makeshift grinder as part of the supermarket or gourmet store sales package. It is better to spend a little and buy a solid, metal nutmeg grinder that will last you a long time, if not a lifetime. Alternatively, you can use a rasp-style grater (such as a Microplane) to grate your nutmeg. Freshly ground nutmeg can't be beat; its aroma is heady and the taste spectacular. Whole nutmeg will keep for at least one year.

, Nutmeg goes well with certain types of savoury dishes:


Cheese dishes
Pumpkin - pumpkin soup and mashed pumpkin
Soups
Spinach
Ravioli
Cannelloni, especially the vegetarian version
Add pinch or two to cooked greens such as spinach, chard, kale, etc.

Stews, haggis and sausages
Middle Eastern curry dishes
Porridge

, Again, nutmeg goes well with certain types of sweet dishes:



Custard, including rhubarb and custard

Cake, especially spice cakes

, Bay leaves release their flavor during slow cooking, so the longer the better. Consider adding bay leaves to casseroles, stews, soups, marinades, pasta sauces. Bay leaves also impart a great flavor to white, cream/cheese sauces (for example, béchamel sauce).

, The flavor of bay comes out nicely with steaming. Try with vegetables, fish, seafood, or chicken in a steamer.

, Although bay leaves impart a lovely flavor to the food with which they are cooked, they are not appetizing in themselves. Anyone who has bitten into the forgotten bay leaf will quickly attest to this! Fish it out before serving the dish on plates. This is also why it's important to put the whole bay leaf into the dish, so it can be removed easily later. Don't break it up into small pieces.

, Bay leaves can be used in potpourri, wreaths and other decorations, such as the dried orange and bay leaf hanger pictured here. They provide a ""Provençal"" touch.

, Thyme bouquets are great when used in marinades or with anything that can be roasted. Just be sure to remove the woody stem prior to consumption.

"
"
Detach the leaves from the stem using either your fingers or a fork.,
Spread the leftover leaves (detached from the stem) on a plate in a cool location.

,
Check the leaves after several days to see if the drying process is complete.,
Push the thyme leaves into a pile when they are dry and transfer the leaves to a resealable container.

,
Store the dehydrated thyme leaves in the refrigerator.Label the container with the ""packed on"" date and the contents.,
Finished.

",How to Prepare and Store Fresh Thyme3," Do this only after the sprigs have been washed well and patted dry.


If you use your fingers, gently hold the top of the stem with one hand and use your other hand to gently pinch and run down the stem detaching the leaves.
If you wish to use a fork instead, gently hold the top and run the stem between the tines.

,, If not, stir the leaves gently and return the plate to the drying area.

,,
Note that dried thyme is one of the best herbs for retaining flavor.
Still yet, thyme is best fresh (as is the case with most herbs).

Remove as many cloves as you need from the head.,
Soak the cloves in cold water for five minutes, making sure they are fully submerged.,
Remove from water.",How to Peel a Garlic Clove2," Remove any easily peeled skins briefly before moving on.

, Place the cloves in 1-2 inches of water and let them rest. The water will loosen the skins. Use a metal whisk to beat the garlic and speed up the process.Place the cloves in a covered or watertight container when possible. While the skins will loosen if they are soaked, you can also shake the container to knock the skins off the garlic even faster.

, The skin should be loose and easily removed by hand now. Pinch off the skin by pulling on the clove, and cut the ends off if there is any tricky bits still stuck on the clove.







"
"
Remove the cloves you need from the head.,
Put the garlic clove/s in the microwave for 5-10 seconds.,
Cut away the loose remaining skin.",How to Peel a Garlic Clove3," Do no microwave the entire head of garlic, as this can ruin it for later nights. Simply remove the cloves you plan on using right then.

, With the garlic on a small plate, heat them up briefly on high. You should notice the skin billowing and loosening.

, Cut the root end off with a knife and the skin will slide off easily.

Place the entire garlic head inside one stainless steel bowl.,
Cover the bowl with another identical stainless steel bowl.,
Hold the edges of the two bowls together and shake.,
Open the bowls and remove any waste.,
Keep shaking until all of the skins are removed.",How to Peel a Garlic Clove4," This is a great method for pealing an entire head of garlic at once. Remove whatever loose papery skin you can by hand before beginning.

, Place the bowls together, open side to open side, to form a larger 'sealed' bowl.

, Let the garlic clang around inside the bowls for 1-2 minutes, shaking vigorously.








, You should be left with the individual cloves, which will likely still be covered in skin. Remove the skins and the hard bottom chunk of the bulb and throw them in the compost or trash. Then reseal the bowls.








, You may have to pick off some of the finer, thinner skins by hand, or use another method to remove the individual clove skins, such as soaking the cloves in water in the stainless steel bowl. However, with enough shaking the majority of skins should fall off on their own."
"
Separate the cloves.,
Place the cloves evenly under a dry cloth.,
Pound the garlic cloves once or twice with a mallet.,
Remove the cloves from the cracked outer shell.",How to Peel a Garlic Clove5," Pull the cloves you want to peel off the head and place them on a cutting board.

, The cloth will control the garlic from flying off the table as you hit it. Any kitchen towel will do.

, This will crack the shell, allowing for better peeling. This is similar to using the knife blade, but it is easier to do on many pieces of garlic at once.









You don't want to smash the cloves, simply hit them lightly but firmly to get the skins off.

, Lift the cloth and pull away the remaining skins. You may need to cut some of the ends off to fully remove them.

Choose a head of garlic to use for the garlic oil.,
Pull apart the cloves of garlic until they are all separated into several pieces.








,
Peel the skin off the garlic cloves.,
Place the garlic in a small pot.,
Cover the garlic with about 2 cups (16 ounces) of oil.,
Heat the oil and garlic on a low to medium-low setting.,
Let the oil and garlic heat for at least 15 minutes and up to 30 minutes.,
Use the garlic oil immediately.,
Cool the oil to room temperature.








,
Use a strainer or a slotted spoon to remove and discard the garlic cloves.








,
Store the remaining oil in an airtight container or a glass jar.",How to Make Garlic Oil," You can buy garlic at your grocery store, farmer's market or local produce shop. Or, you might grow your own.






;
,, This may be time consuming, and your hands and fingers will likely end up smelling like garlic.









Try to keep the garlic cloves whole. An easy way to peel garlic is to smash the clove with a knife and then peel away the loosened skin. You do not want to do that when you are making garlic oil because it might result in pieces of garlic floating around in the oil after it is heated and strained.
Avoid rinsing or soaking the garlic in water before you peel it. While some people do this to loosen the skin, it will put your garlic at risk for developing a bacteria that could contaminate your oil.

, You could also use a sauté pan. Anything large enough to accommodate the garlic and the oil will work.








, You can use any oil that you enjoy. Extra virgin olive oil seems to be the most popular among chefs and food bloggers, but good results have also been found with canola oil and grapeseed oil.








, If you have a thermometer, keep the oil at around 200 to 210 degrees Fahrenheit (93 to 98 degrees Celsius) and no higher than 220 degrees Fahrenheit (104 degrees Celsius).









Judge the heat without a thermometer by making sure it is hot enough that the oil bubbles gently. If the garlic starts to fry or brown, just remove the pan from the heat for 2 minutes.

, You will know the garlic flavor has infused into the oil when it becomes opaque in color.









Cook the oil for longer (closer to 30 minutes) for a stronger garlic taste. For a lighter flavor, turn the heat off after 15 minutes.

, You can either remove the cloves with a slotted spoon, or pour the oil onto what you are cooking with the cloves, depending on your taste.








,,, The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends you use the oil within 1 to 2 weeks in order to avoid bacteria such as botulism or salmonella.

VERY IMPORTANT: Always use Organic garlic.,
Pull the garlic free from the bulb.,
Check over the clove for any brown spots.,
Trim the organic garlic until the brown spot is no longer visible.

,
Simply slice your garlic and now you are ready to cook with it or grill on a George Foreman.",How to Pick a Good Garlic and Trim It," You can find organic garlic that is grown here in the U.S at most grocery stores or health food store.


Also always buy the loose bulbs, sometimes when buying them in bags, you will find some of the garlic is fresh and some of it is old. When buying one bulb at a time you can feel for firmness as well as checking that the skin is very tight and a light color, versus a dark yellow.
Also garlic should never stink or smell strong when you are buying it in the bulb. A sweet mellow garlic smell is best. After you have purchased your garlic and get it home, break off a clove or two and begin.;
, You will have the papery skin still attached to the clove. On the end of the clove you will see where it was connected to the bulb. There is a rough end. Trim this off with a sharp knife.


Once you have trimmed the rough end off. The skin will start to come off. Often times people suggest to smash the clove with a knife to get the skin off. It's, actually, rarely necessary to do this. If keeping the clove whole, you will be able to slice it.

, Usually if a small spot you can trim off and the garlic is still good. If two or more spots, just pitch it in the trash can and get another clove.

Peel the garlic.,
Mince the garlic.,
Add a generous pinch of coarse salt.,
Chop the garlic into a paste.,
Pulverize the garlic in a plastic baggie instead.,
Use immediately for maximum flavor.",How to Make Garlic Paste1," Start with firm, fresh garlic, since the plant develops a harsh, bitter taste as it ages. Peel the cloves and remove any green sprouts (another source of bitterness).


One easy way to peel garlic is to smash it with the side of a chef's knife, then pull off the loosened skin.;
, Chop the garlic as finely as possible with a large, sharp chef's knife.


If you have a zip-locked bag, a meat mallet, and a rolling pin, skip the chopping and scroll down to the end of this section.

, Sea salt or other coarse-grained salt helps grind the garlic into a paste, and draws out moisture for a softer, juicier result., Scrape the garlic into a small pile. Hold the blunt edge of your knife with both hands, pointing it away from you at a low angle, close to the cutting board. Scrape the knife over the garlic repeatedly until it forms a paste.Occasionally scrape the garlic back into a pile and mince briefly to remove large pieces.

, If you have the right tools, there's a faster way to turn garlic into a paste:Drop the peeled garlic and salt into a small plastic baggie. Seal the bag closed.
Crush the garlic lightly with a meat mallet, without tearing the bag.
Finish the job with a rolling pin. Periodically pick up the bag and squeeze the garlic to the bottom to ensure a smooth paste.

, Try the paste on garlic bread, toss onto pasta, or add to stir fries.


If you do have leftovers, store in the coldest part of your fridge. Discard after three days even if there are no obvious signs of spoilage."

Sterilize your jar first by leaving it in boiling water for up to 2 minutes, then drain and dry.,
Add the garlic granules up from 1/4 to 1/3rd of the jar.

,
Add filtered or boiled water at room temperature to fill the jar 2/3rds full.

,
Screw on lid and leave overnight in the fridge.

,
The next day, the granules should have swollen and filled the jar.,
To cook, use as ordinary chopped garlic in the same quantity and method so instead of using a large amount of dried granules, you are using a much smaller amount for the same flavour.

",How to Reconstitute Dried Garlic Granules," Be careful and if you have rubber tipped tongs it makes it much easier to get the jar out of the hot water.;
,,,, The enzymes in the garlic are ""revived"" and you would use the same amount as per ordinary garlic.


Some garlic granules absorb water at different rates. If it looks a little soupy, add 1/2 tsp more of dried granules and allow these to swell in the same manner.

Smash apart the garlic.,
Find two bowls.,
Shake the garlic inside the bowls.,
Check the garlic.",How to Peel a Head of Garlic1," Place the head of garlic on the counter top. Smash rapidly downward with the heel of your hand. This will separate the head into individual cloves.


This sends the cloves flying. If there's no wall stopping the cloves from falling off, instead slice off the top of the head and pull the cloves apart.
You can use this method for as many heads at once as you can fit loosely into the containers.;
, These will need to fit firmly together. Achieve this by choosing one bowl larger than the other, or two equal bowls with a wide rim for gripping. Lightweight metal bowls are sturdy and easy to shake, but you can use any material. It's the cloves themselves that break apart each other's skin during the shaking.You can use cups, jars, light saucepans, a cocktail shaker, or any other sturdy containers that are easy to grip — and easy to clean afterward.

, Place the garlic cloves into one of the bowls. Invert the other bowl and place it over the first. Pick them up, grip firmly, and shake vigorously.Ten or fifteen good shakes should do it.

, Large, white garlic should be completely peeled now. Unusually fresh garlic or sticky purple varieties may need more shaking."

Add some of the oil in a thin stream.,
Add a little lemon juice.,
Alternate between oil and lemon juice.,
Repair a broken sauce.,
Serve as a dip or sauce.,
Use within three days.",How to Make Garlic Paste2," Peel three heads of garlic (about 30 cloves). You do not need to chop them, but do cut out and discard any green sprouts. Young, unsprouted garlic is best, as it has a less harsh flavor.


You can scale down this recipe, but only if you have a small blender or food processor. A large food processor requires at least this much garlic in order to process it smoothly.To peel a large quantity of garlic, drop the cloves into a metal bowl. Turn a second bowl the same size upside down and place them together to form a dome. Shake vigorously for a minute or two to remove the peel., Combine the whole garlic cloves with salt to taste, or about 1 tsp (5 mL). Run the food processor or blender until the garlic is evenly chopped into small pieces. Stop whenever the garlic is thrown to the sides, then scrape it back down to the center using a rubber spatula., The rest of this recipe will create an emulsion, combining oil and water into a smooth paste. It's important to leave the blender or food processor on throughout the next few steps, or the oil and water may separate and leave you with a broken sauce.


Depending on the endurance of your blender, you may need to move fast to avoid overtaxing the motor.

, Separate the white of one egg and blend into the garlic until smooth. While not required, the egg white contains emulsifiers that will make it much easier to keep the garlic paste together. It may have a slight effect on the aftertaste, but this is barely noticeable under the garlic.Uncooked egg white can harbor salmonella, a bacteria that causes illness. To avoid this, use the white of a pasteurized egg, replace with powdered egg white, or skip this step entirely. Salmonella is most dangerous to young children, pregnant women, elderly people, and people with compromised immune systems., Pour a light, neutral-flavored oil very slowly down the side of the blender or food processor. Adding the oil too quickly is a common source of broken sauces. Keep pouring until you've added about ½ cup (120 mL) of oil.Canola oil, safflower oil, sunflower oil and peanut oil all fit the bill.Traditional recipes use olive oil, which makes a denser sauce. (This may be why toum is often described as a paste despite its usually fluffy consistency.) However, olive oil also lends a somewhat bitter flavor, especially after storing., Now add ½ tsp (2.5 mL) lemon juice, again pouring slowly. Wait a few seconds until the juice is well absorbed. This adds flavor and creates the right ratio of oil to water., Repeat the last two steps, slowly pouring in ½ cup (120 mL) of oil, then ½ tsp (2.5 mL) lemon juice. Continue for the next 8–10 minutes, until you run out of an ingredient or until the garlic paste looks fluffy and smooth.

, If liquid appears, your toum has separated. There are several ways to fix it, though none are guaranteed:


Stop adding ingredients and let your machine process it back into a smooth paste.This may work if you were pouring ingredients too quickly.
Scoop out half the sauce, add another egg white, blend until smooth, then blend in the other half.Add an ice cube.Heat can cause a sauce to break apart, but you may need to add more oil to compensate for the extra water., In Lebanon and surrounding regions, people often eat toum on pita bread or on chicken shawarma. It also tastes great on kebabs, garlic bread, or mixed into any soup or salad dressing that calls for garlic.

, Several outbreaks of botulism, a potentially fatal disease, have been linked to garlic stored in oil. The bacteria that causes botulism can reproduce even in the refrigerator and does not cause any obvious changes in the paste's taste or appearance. This paste is safe to eat within three days. After that, freeze or throw away the leftovers.Store the garlic paste in the coldest part of your fridge, near the back. This slows down the development of botulinum bacteria, and protects against other sources of spoilage. Use an airtight container.
Freeze in airtight containers with 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm) of head space to allow for expansion.

Smash each clove with a knife.,
Pinch cloves between your fingers.,
Buy a rubber mat or garlic peeler.,
Use a garlic press.",How to Peel a Head of Garlic2," Smash apart the head of garlic, or slice off the tip with a knife and pull apart the cloves. Place the flat of a wide knife blade over a single clove. Smack the knife blade firmly with the heel of your hand. The clove will now be slightly smashed and easily separated from its skin.Now you can mince the garlic or crush it into a paste.


If you don't have a wide knife, place the heel of your hand over the clove and press firmly., This method is less effective, but useful if you want to use a whole clove without bruising it. Hold the garlic clove with the flatter end against your thumb, with your forefinger hooked over the pointy end. Pinch your fingers together to bend the clove, splitting the skin. Tug the skin off in one piece.This works best for cloves with papery skin.

, These silicone or rubber tubes are relatively cheap and easy to use. Put the garlic in the tube, roll it over a surface, and the skin comes right off.


You can use a silicone or rubber mat instead, rolling it into a tube yourself. This saves on kitchen space since they double as jar openers or non-slip surfaces.

, A garlic press crushes a clove of garlic through a mesh, squeezing out mashed garlic and leaving the skin behind. Some chefs dislike using kitchen space on a one-purpose tool, but these can save a lot of time if you don't have the knife skills of a ninja.



Try these tricks to clean the skin out of your press afterward.

;
, While you can cook shrimp that hasn't yet been peeled, butterflied shrimp is usually peeled before cooking. Peeling the shrimp opens up the flesh, making it easier to slice into it and create a butterflied shape. The tail may either be left in place or removed, depending on how you want your shrimp to look. To peel your shrimp,









Pull off the heads (if your shrimp came with heads attached).
Pull off the legs.
Peel off the shells - slip your fingers under near the head, then peel it off the body.
Leave the tails on or remove them.

, This is the black, grey, or brown vein running along the shrimp's back. Before you can butterfly the shrimp, it needs to be removed. Position a paring knife at the head part of the shrimp, and gently slice along the shrimp's back to expose the digestive tract. Lift it out of the shrimp and wipe it off on a paper towel.









If the tract breaks up into pieces, run the shrimp under a stream of water for a few seconds to wash it out.
You can also use a shrimp deveiner to remove the digestive tract from smaller shrimp.

, Turn the shrimp over to check if it has a visible nerve cord, which runs along the inside curve. If you see a dark line there, you might want to remove it. The nerve cord is edible, but it can affect the appearance of the dish. To remove it, gently run the paring knife along the nerve cord to cut through the flesh and expose it. Lift the nerve cord from the shrimp and discard it.









You can skip this step if you're battering and frying the shrimp, or if you don't mind the nerve cord being visible.
Removing the nerve cord is a little trickier than removing the digestive tract. Be careful not to slice the shrimp all the way through.

, Take the knife and make a deeper cut along the inner curve of the shrimp so that the body is divided into two attached halves. Take care not to slice all the way through the shrimp.








, Place it under running water, then set in a bowl of ice to keep fresh while you finish butterflying the remaining shrimp.








, Place the tip of your knife in the cut near the head of the shrimp, then cut along the back all the way to the tail. Don't cut all the way through the shrimp - just deep enough so that the body divides into two connected halves, like a butterfly.








, Give it a quick rinse under cool tap water, then place it on ice to keep it cold while you butterfly the rest of the shrimp.

Pour the water into a microwave-safe cup or bowl.,
Place a clean, microwave-safe object in the water.,
Put the water in the microwave.,
To sterilize water, keep it boiling.,
Don't heat the water for excessively long stretches.,
Avoid extremely smooth containers.,
Carefully tap the side of the container when it finishes heating.,
Stir the hot water with a long object while it is in the microwave.,
Keep your face away from the container until you are sure it is safe.",How to Boil Water in the Microwave," Boiling water with a microwave is remarkably easy. To start, pour the water into a container made of the microwave-safe materials listed above.


Make sure the container is not sealed shut. A buildup of hot steam can cause a harmful explosion.;
, Next, put a non-metallic object such as a wooden spoon, a chopstick, or a popsicle stick in the water. This prevents a dangerous problem called ""super-heating"" by giving the water something to form bubbles on.


Super-heating occurs when water in the microwave heats water past its boiling point and the water is unable to form bubbles because there are no nucleation sites (essentially rough spots for the bubbles to form on). As soon as the water is disturbed or a nucleation site is introduced, the built-up superheated water forms steam very quickly, causing a small explosion of boiling water.If you don't have any non-metallic objects to put in your water, use a container that has a scratch or chip on the interior surface. This will act as a nucleation site to help the water bubble.

, Heat in short (e.g., no more than one and a half minute) intervals, stirring regularly until the water is steaming. Even if these steps are followed, bubbling may not be obvious as it would be on the stove. The most accurate way to ensure the water is boiling is to use a thermometer. At sea level, water boils at (212° F; 100° C); this temperature decreases at higher altitudes.


If you're using a container that holds heat well (like a glass or ceramic one), be careful when you take the water out of the microwave to stir it. Use a towel or potholder to protect yourself from burns as you handle it.

, If you're boiling water to purify it, heat it in the microwave long enough to kill the microorganisms. The Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Protection Agency recommend boiling the water for at least one minute, or 3 minutes at altitudes above 6,562 feet (>2000 m)., If, after reading the advice in the section above, you're worried about a superheating accident when you try to boil water, don't worry — there's more you can do to keep yourself safe. For instance, perhaps the single biggest thing you can do to avoid the risk of superheated water is to not heat it for long periods of time. If your water isn't heated past its boiling point, it can't become superheated.


The exact amount of time you'll want to limit your heating sessions to can vary based on the strength of your microwave. To be safe, try limiting your heating to a single one-minute segment at first. Based on how hot the water gets from this first heating attempt, you can adjust your next one accordingly.

, For the same reason that it it's a good idea to add something non-metallic to your water or to use a container with scratches in it, it's a bad idea to use perfectly smooth containers. Examples of these can often include new, pristine glass and ceramic bowls, though a variety of other materials can also be smooth enough to cause problems.


Instead, use an older, more worn container or one with visible scratches at the bottom — these will create nucleation sites for bubbles to form.

, Once you believe you've heated your water long enough to get it hot, check for superheating by firmly tapping on the side of the container before you take it out of the microwave. Ideally, this should be done with a long tool to protect your hands.


If the water is superheated, tapping the container can cause it to suddenly ""burst"" over the top. This may spill water into the microwave, but since you haven't removed it yet, you should avoid any burns.

, Still not sure whether the water is superheated or not? Stir it with a long rod or stirring stick to know for sure. Introducing an object and disturbing the water gives it nucleation sites to form bubbles — if it is superheated, it will rapidly burst or boil over. If it doesn't, congratulations! Your water is safe.

, This may seem like it goes without saying, but it's important not to put your face anywhere near water that you think may have even a tiny risk of being superheated. Most injuries from superheated water result when a person removes the water from the microwave and looks into the container — a sudden burst of superheated water at this point can cause serious burns on the face and even permanent vision damage in the worst of cases.

Choose a pot with a lid.,
Add cold tap water.,
Add salt for flavor (optional).,
Place the pot over high heat.,
Learn the stages of boiling.,
Add the food.,
Turn down the heat.",How to Boil Water1," A lid will trap heat inside the pot, making the water boil faster. A large pot will take longer to boil, but the shape does not make a noticeable difference., Hot tap water can pick up lead from your water pipes, and is not recommended for drinking or cooking.Start with cold tap water instead. Don't fill it all the way — a full pot can splash you as it boils, and you'll need space to add the food if you're cooking.









Don't believe the myth: cold water does not boil faster than hot water.It's the safe option, but it will take a bit longer.

, Salt has almost no effect on the boiling temperature, even if you add enough to make it seawater!Add it only to flavor the food — especially pasta, which will absorb the salt along with the water.








You might notice a bunch of bubbles rise up as soon as you put the salt in. It's a fun effect, but it doesn't change the temperature.Add salt when boiling eggs. If the shell cracks, the salt will help the egg white solidify, plugging the hole., Place the pot on the stove and turn the burner underneath it to high. Cover the pot with a lid to help the water boil a little faster.








, Most recipes will either call for a simmer or a rolling boil. Learn how to recognize these stages, plus a couple less common options that will help you find the perfect temperature:








Quiver: Tiny bubbles appear at the base of the pot, but do not rise. The surface quivers slightly. This happens at about 140–170ºF (60–75ºC), a temperature good for poaching eggs, fruit, or fish.
Sub-simmer: A couple little streams of bubbles are rising, but most of the water is still. The water is around 170–195ºF (75–90ºC), and can be used for stew or braising meat.
Simmer: Small to medium bubbles break the surface often, all across the pot. At 195–212ºF (90–100ºC), this is a good time to steaming veggies or melting chocolate, depending how healthy you're feeling.
Full, rolling boil: Steam and constant movement that doesn't stop when you stir the water. This is the hottest your water is going to get: 212ºF (100ºC). Cook pasta at this temperature.

, If you are boiling something in the water, add it now. The cold food will lower the water temperature, and might reduce it to an earlier stage. That's fine; just leave the heat on high or medium until the water returns to the correct level.









Unless a recipe specifically tells you to, don't add the food before the water is hot. That makes it hard to estimate the cooking time, and can have unexpected effects. For example, meat ends up tougher and less flavorful if exposed to cold water at any time during cooking.

, High heat is useful when you want to get the water to reach boiling temperature quickly. Once you've got where you want, reduce the heat to medium (for boiling) or medium-low (for simmering). Once the water is at a rolling boil, more heat will only make it boil away faster.









Check on the pot occasionally for the first few minutes, to make sure the water is stable at the stage you want it.
When you're making soup or another long-simmering dish, leave the lid slightly ajar. Closing the lid completely will raise the temperature too high for these recipes.

Add chicken to a salad.",How to Bake Chicken Breast," Remove your chicken from the package and pat it down with paper towels. Rub a little butter or olive oil onto the chicken to add moisture and flavor.If you're using any seasoning, sprinkle it on both sides of the chicken now. For example, you could add something like garlic and dried basil or a cajun seasoning mix. It depends on what flavor you're going for.;
, Lining with foil will make for easy cleanup. Place the chicken in a baking dish. If you're cooking more than one chicken breast, keep them slightly apart. You do not want them to touch. You can also add something like lemon slices or wedges to add extra flavoring to your chicken.If using skinless chicken, cover the baking dish with parchment paper. Take one sheet of parchment paper and cover one side with butter. Lay it on top of the chicken. Then, tuck the edges of the parchment paper underneath the breast to keep the chicken fully covered. The parchment will act almost like the chicken skin helping it to remain moist and keeping it from drying out., Make sure your oven is completely preheated before putting the chicken in the oven. It's a good idea to use an oven thermometer to make sure your oven is at the right temperature., Usually, it takes around 30 to 40 minutes to bake chicken breast. You should start using a meat thermometer to check the temperature about 20 minutes in. Some chicken breasts may cook slightly faster, so you want to make sure it does not burn. Check the chicken every 10 minutes or so after the first 20 minutes., Chicken breasts should be 160 degrees Fahrenheit (about 21 degrees Celsius) at the center. Keep the chicken in the oven until it reaches this temperature.Insert your meat thermometer in the center of your meat.Once the chicken is heated to the right temperature, remove it from the oven.

, Once the chicken reaches the right temperature, you can let it cool for a few minutes and eat it immediately. You can also store the chicken in an airtight container, like a Tupperware container, and eat it later., If you want to add some flavor to your chicken, squeeze some lemon or lime juice over it. This will give it a mildly citrus flavor.If you use lime, use mint to compliment the flavor.
Try sprinkling some fresh herbs over your chicken to compliment a lemon flavor.

, Mustard goes well with chicken. You can spread some dijon or plain mustard over a chicken breast before serving it. If you're having chicken breast on a sandwich, add mustard to the sandwich., You can use your chicken breast to make chicken kabobs. Cut your chicken into small slices and then stick small wooden sticks through them. You can also add things like roasted red peppers and other vegetables to your kabobs for a quick, healthy snack or meal., You can chop up chicken breast and add it to a salad. This can be a quick and healthy lunch or dinner."

Choose your preferred style of boiled eggs.,
Choose your method.,
Prepare the egg.,
Remove hot eggs with care.",How to Boil Eggs1," Are you someone who prefers a soft-boiled egg or a hard-boiled egg? Occasionally, you might even have to make different levels of boiled egg just to please every member of the household! The times suggested throughout this article are dependent on personal preference, so some experimenting should take place. The types of boiled egg are:










Coddled, or soft-boiled – very gooey yolk.
Mollet eggs – these will have a semi-liquid yolk; outer white is firm enough for shell to be peeled.
Hard-boiled – yolk is cooked to firmness.

, As you will see from the following various suggested methods, making boiled eggs is something of an art form that has arisen through trial and error for many centuries. If you don't already have a preferred method, perhaps try out each method to achieve the desired result before choosing one that you intend to rely on.









For soft boiled eggs, the rule of thumb is to use the shorter cooking times for softly set whites and runny yolks. Increase the cooking time for firmly set whites and slightly set yolks.For hard-boiled eggs, bear in mind that cooking the eggs any longer than 12 minutes should not be done because this risks turning the whites rubbery and the yolks crumbly.If you want the egg yolk to remain centered (often important for appearance when using a hard-boiled egg for a special dish), cook the eggs in cold water from the start and slowly bring to the boil. Stir gently using a wooden spoon as this happens, until they're boiling, and you'll find that the yolks stay centered.Note that when a method suggests boiling once the eggs are in the water, that this means simmering. Rapid boiling will cause the eggs to turn rubbery and tough. High cooking temperatures toughen the protein in eggs, and since eggs coagulate with heat, the best cooking methods will always involve cooking slowly at a low temperature., Eggs that have been refrigerated for several days have a higher pH and are more likely to crack, but they are easier to peel. Cooking expert Rose Elliot recommends pricking the egg at its rounded end prior to boiling.She suggests that doing this helps the air to escape and prevents the egg from bursting or cracking.Special egg-prickers can be purchased, or you can use a needle. Alternatively, if you've never found this to be an issue with the eggs you use because you've kept them at room temperature or they're fresh from the hens, then you probably don't need to worry about it.









In each case, you can boil more than one egg at a time; just be sure there is sufficient room. It is possible to purchase special egg holders for more than one egg boiling – speak to a kitchen retailer for more details.
If the eggs do crack, a few drops of vinegar will stop leakage from the shell.A cracked egg can also be wrapped in aluminum foil and boiled., Use a slotted spoon to remove eggs from boiling water and take the usual precautions around hot water.

Place the potatoes in a bowl and cover them with water.,
Allow the potatoes to soak for several minutes.,
Rinse the potatoes with fresh water.,
Pat the potatoes dry.,
Preheat the deep fryer.,
Heat the olive oil.,
Add the garlic and fry it for a minute.,
Drain the garlic on a paper towel-lined plate.,
Place the potatoes in the fryer’s basket and drop them into the oil.,
Fry the potatoes until they are golden brown.,
Remove the potatoes from the fryer and drain on a paper towel.,
Combine the fries, garlic, salt, and parsley in a large bowl.,
Serve the fries immediately.",How to Make Garlic Fries," To make the French fries, you need three medium Idaho or russet potatoes that have been peeled and cut into ½-inch (13-cm) thick strips. Set the potatoes in a bowl and cover them with cold water.Using three potatoes will give you two servings of the garlic fries. If you want to make a larger batch, you can easily double or triple the ingredients. Keep in mind that you’ll likely have to fry the potatoes in batches, though, because they won’t all fit in the deep fryer at the same time.
If you prefer thicker or thinner fries, you can adjust the size of the strips that you cut the potatoes into. Thicker fries will take longer to fry, while thinner fries will require less time to become golden brown.;
, Once you’ve covered the potatoes with the water, leave them to soak for at least 20 minutes. That will help remove some of the excess starch so the interior of the fries will be fluffier when they’re finished frying.If you have the time, soaking the potatoes for 2 to 3 hours will result in the fluffiest fries. You can even place the bowl with the potatoes in the fridge and soak them overnight.

, When the potatoes are finished soaking, remove them from the bowl. Run them under the cold water from the sink to rinse them off and set them down on a large baking sheet or other platter.Rinsing the fries is an important step because some of the starch may still be present on the potatoes. Running them under the water helps remove any lingering residue.

, With the potatoes in a single, even layer, use a clean kitchen towel or paper towels to dry the fries. Pat gently on both sides to make sure that the potatoes are completely dry.To ensure that they fry up crisply, make sure that the potatoes are completely dry.

, When you’re ready to fry the French fries, it’s important to preheat the deep fryer. Fill the fryer with peanut or canola oil according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Turn the heat to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius) and allow it to fully heat.You don’t need a table top deep fryer to make the fries. Heat 3- to 4-inches of the oil in a heavy-bottomed stock pot or Dutch oven, and use a deep-fry or candy thermometer to monitor the temperature until it reaches 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).
While peanut and canola oils both work for frying the potatoes, peanut oil is usually the best option because it has the highest smoke point.

, While the deep fryer is preheating, add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of extra virgin olive oil to a medium skillet. Turn the burner to medium, and allow the oil to heat for approximately 5 minutes, or until it begins to shimmer., Once the oil is heated, mix 4 cloves of finely chopped garlic into the skillet. Allow the garlic to cook for about a minute, or until it is an even golden brown all over.If you want the fries to have an even stronger garlic flavor, you can increase the amount of cloves to suit your tastes.
Make sure to swirl, shake, or stir the garlic as it’s heating so it cooks evenly.
Garlic can burn very quickly, so it’s very important to keep a close eye on it. If it seems like it’s browning too quickly, lower the heat.

, When the garlic has become golden brown, use a slotted spoon to remove it from the skillet. Set it down on a plate or baking sheet lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil.The oil that’s left in the skillet will be infused with the flavor of the garlic. You may want to save it to use it in another recipe, such as a salad dressing.

, When the deep fryer is preheated, transfer the fries to its basket. Carefully lower the potatoes into the hot oil.Because the oil will be extremely hot, make sure to lower the basket into the fryer very slowly. If you splash the oil on your skin, you will likely get burned.
If you aren’t using a deep fryer, place the French fries directly in the oil in the pot in a single layer.

, Allow the potatoes to cook in the oil until they are golden brown, which should take 7 to 8 minutes. Shake the basket periodically to ensure that they cook evenly.If you are frying the potatoes in a pot, use a metal slotted spoon to move the fries around to ensure that they cook evenly.
You can also bake the fries if you prefer. Toss the potatoes with some olive oil, salt, and pepper, and place them in a single layer on a large greased baking sheet. Cook them in an oven preheated to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius) for about 30 minutes or until browned. Turn the heat up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius), and bake for another 5 minutes., When the French fries are finished cooking, lift the basket out of the oil and allow them to drain for a minute or so. Next, transfer the fries to a platter or baking sheet lined with paper towel to absorb the excess oil., After the fries are drained but still warm, place them in a large bowl. Add the cooked garlic, kosher salt to taste, and 2 tablespoons (3 g) of finely chopped flat-leaf parsley, and toss together so the fries are fully coated.You can substitute curly parsley for the flat-leaf if you prefer.
If you want to add some cheesy flavor to the fries, you can add ¼ cup (25 g) of grated Parmesan in with the garlic, salt, and parsley.

, Once the fries are coated with the garlic mixture, transfer them to a serving platter. The fries are delicious on their own, but you can serve them with a dipping sauce, such as a Parmesan aioli or your favorite ketchup."

Choose food that is less likely to cause problems.,
Be careful with foods that can quickly turn bad.,
Choose pre-packaged single-serves.",How to Keep Food Safe at a Tailgate Party1," Unlike a party at home, you will find it much harder to keep foods cold or warm enough to fend off bacterial growth. You can minimize the risk of bacterial contamination of food by choosing foods that travel well outdoors. Some examples include:



Dry food: Bread, rolls, crackers, etc. are usually safe choices. It's what you add to them that requires care, such as hot dogs, luncheon meats and salads.

Food high in sugar: Sugar acts as a preservative and, in conjunction with dryness, can make foods safe for the tailgate party. For example, cake (no cream filling), cookies and candies.

Fresh fruits and vegetables: Provided these are washed and handled properly, they are generally safe to enjoy at the tailgate party.;
, Food that contains meat, milk and egg can go bad quickly when not refrigerated or cooked properly. These are the foods to be most careful with.


Other foods that are potentially hazardous unless great care is taken to keep them at the right temperature include rice, custard, potatoes, puddings and stuffing. Each of these food types needs to be kept and served at the right temperature.

, Food that is packaged individually for each person, wrapped in food grade plastic and kept at the right temperature tends to be a safe option for tailgate occasions. Individual packaging minimizes the amount of handling from other people during the party.


Cream-based dips are not a great idea at a tailgate party––many people dipping into the same dip and the need to leave the item out in the open can lead to it fast becoming a hazardous food item. On the other hand, an individual tomato-based dip, such as salsa, can be a great way to share around those corn chips.


Make salsa at home, then place individual portions into separate containers with lids. Keep refrigerated and hand out straight from the cooler just when everyone is ready to dip their chips.

Boil water to kill bacteria and other pathogens.,
Bring the water to a rolling boil.,
Keep boiling for 1–3 minutes (optional).,
Let cool and store in closed containers.,
Carry a portable boiling device when traveling.,
Leave plastic containers in the sun as a last resort.",How to Boil Water2," Just about every harmful microorganism found in water will die when the water is heated.Boiling will not remove most chemical contamination.








If the water is cloudy, filter the water first to remove dirt.

, It's the heat that kills microorganisms, not the boiling action itself. However, without a thermometer, a rolling boil is the only accurate way to tell how hot the water is. Wait until the water is steaming and churning. By this point, all the dangerous organisms should be dead.







, To be extra cautious, leave the water at a rolling boil for 1 minute. (Count to 60 slowly.) If you are higher than 6,500 ft (2,000 m) above sea level, let it boil for 3 minutes instead. (Count to 180 slowly.)








Water boils at a lower temperature at high elevations. This slightly cooler water takes longer to kill organisms.

, Even after cooling, the boiled water will be safe to drink. Keep it in clean, closed containers.








The water will taste ""flat"" compared to normal water, because some of the air inside it escaped. To improve the taste, pour the water back and forth between two clean containers.The water will trap more air as it falls.

, If you will have access to electricity, bring along an electric heating coil. If not, carry a camping stove or kettle, plus a fuel source or batteries.








, If you have no way to boil water, put the water in a clear, plastic container. Leave it for at least six hours in direct sunlight. This will kill some dangerous bacteria, but it is not as safe as boiling.







"
"
Put the water in a microwave-safe cup or bowl.,
Add a microwave-safe object to the water.,
Put the water in the microwave.,
Heat in short intervals, stirring regularly.",How to Boil Water3," If you can't find a dish labeled ""microwave safe,"" choose glass or ceramic cookware that does not have any metallic paint. To test whether it is microwave safe, place it in the microwave, empty, next to a cup of water. Microwave for one minute. If the dish is hot after the minute is up, it is not microwave safe.








For increased safety, use a container that has a scratch or chip (in scientific terms, a nucleation site) on the interior surface. This will help the water bubble, reducing the risk of an (already unlikely) ""superheated"" explosion., This also helps the water bubble. Try a wooden spoon, chopstick, or popsicle stick. If you don't mind flavoring the water, even a spoonful of salt or sugar should be enough.








Avoid using a plastic object, which may be too smooth to allow bubbles to form on it.

, In most microwaves, the edge of the rotating carousel will heat up faster than the center.







, For maximum safety, look up recommended water heating times in your microwave's manual. If you don't have the manual, try heating in 1-minute intervals. After each interval, cautiously stir the water, then remove it from the microwave to test its temperature. The water is ready when it's steaming and too hot to touch.









If the water is still cool after the first couple minutes, increase the length of each session to 1.5 or 2 minutes. The total amount of time depends on your microwave's power and the amount of water you're boiling.
Don't expect a ""rolling boil"" in a microwave. The water will still reach boiling temperatures, but it will be less obvious.

Choose room temperature eggs.,
Lay the eggs gently in an empty pot.









,
Cover the eggs with about 1"" or 2.5cm of water.,
Add one tablespoon of salt or vinegar to the water.,
Cover the pot.









,
Bring the water to a boil.",How to Boil Eggs2,"





;
,, Use room temperature water. If the water is cold, the eggs will take longer to cook. If the water is hot, though, you may risk the water getting too hot too early and overcooking the eggs (that is, exposing the eggs to boiling temperature for too long).









, This helps the proteins in the white coagulate faster so any cracks in the shell quickly get plugged.







,, Stay close and listen; you should be able to hear the water come to a boil. Do not remove the lid to check. Remove the pot from heat as soon as the water is boiling. The eggs will not overcook. Keep the lid on so the water remains at slightly below boiling point. At this stage, decide about how long you want to leave the eggs in for:










Let the eggs sit for 3 to 5 minutes for coddled or ""soft-boiled"" eggs - runny yolk.
Let the eggs sit for 5-6 minutes for Mollet eggs - slightly runny yolk.
Remove the eggs as soon as the water boils. This is one method suggested by the Larousse Gastronomique for the cold water to boiling method."

Bring the water to the boil in the pot.








,
Select room temperature eggs.







,
Add the eggs to the boiling water.",How to Boil Eggs3,",, Decide how long to plunge the eggs for:









Plunge the eggs into the boiling water and boil for three minutes.Remove after the time is up.
Plunge the eggs into boiling water and boil for one minute only. Remove the pot from the heat and leave the eggs to stand for 3 minutes before removing them from the hot water with a slotted spoon."
"
Choose the eggs.,
Place the eggs into the empty pot.,
Fill the pot with enough cold tap water to cover the eggs.,
Add just enough salt to make the water taste salty.,
Put on the lid.,
Stop the cooking process.",How to Boil Eggs4," The best eggs for hard-boiling are eggs that are several days old. A fresh egg will be much harder to peel as the white still sticks to the shell. If you are planning on peeling the hard-boiled egg for other uses, keep this in mind if boiling eggs freshly collected from your hens.








, Add salt or vinegar to the water if you accidentally crack an egg. It may help the proteins in the egg white thicken faster to plug the cracks in the shell.







, Leave about 1 inch (3 cm) of water over them. Use cold water to help keep the eggs from overcooking, although doing this increases the cooking time.








, This can make the eggs easier to peel because, as mentioned earlier, the proteins coagulate and firm up, making the white easier to separate from the shell. Also, eggs that are less fresh are easier to peel because their higher pH strengthens the membrane. (This can be simulated by making the cooking water more alkaline with a half teaspoon of baking soda per quart of water.)







, Bring the water to the point of boiling, over high heat. From here, there are different approaches to the boiling times and methods:









This following method assumes you started with cold, refrigerated eggs. As soon as the water boils, turn off the heat, but keep the pot on the warm stove. Do not remove the lid. Leave the eggs in the hot water for ten to fifteen minutes.It is important you do not start the timer until the water starts boiling, and that you turn off the heat. Too much time will make the eggs discolored and smelly, while too little time will cause them to be runny.

The Larousse Gastronomique recommends that eggs (room temperature) should be cooked for 10-12 minutes and then plunged into cold water for 7-8 minutes. This will allow them to cool prior to shelling., Chill the eggs by placing them under cold running water or in a bowl of ice water. Let them sit for a few minutes until the eggs are cool.

"
Fill a small saucepan three quarters of the way with water.,
Place the egg(s) into the boiling water.,
Keep the water at a steady simmer.,
Plunge the boiled egg into cold water once sufficient cooking time is over.",How to Boil Eggs5," Bring the water to the boil.








, Start timing from this point.








, The hard boiled stage is reached at:









8 minutes for a lightly hard boiled egg
10 minutes for a dark yellow moist dry yolk and a set white
15 minutes for a light yellow, dry, and granular yolk.

, Doing this stops any further cooking and stops the development of a gray line between the yolk and the egg white.Peeling is easier under cold water, or cold running water (see next).








"
"
Peel the eggs when they are cool enough to handle.,
Roll the egg.,
Slice hard-boiled eggs.,
Eat and enjoy!








",How to Boil Eggs6," There are two possible ways:









Peel them under cold running water. This method works if you don't want to plunge them in cold water.
Try to crack the shells when they're cooling in water. This makes them easier to peel cleanly. When the eggs are done cooking, pour off the hot water and replace with cold. Pick up each egg (be careful, they'll still be hot), and drop it back into the pot of cold water so the shell cracks. As they cool, water pulls into the shells. It will be easier for the shell removal without the egg itself. This is especially useful for dishes where appearance is important, such as with deviled eggs.

, If you're not using water, another method for peeling the egg is to roll it on a hard surface.This will crack the shell and loosen the membrane. Only do this with eggs cool enough to handle, or use silicon mitts.








, If you intend on slicing boiled eggs, do as follows:








Rinse a knife in hot water.
Wipe the knife dry every few cuts to remove sticking yolk from the knife.
Repeat as much as needed.
If you need to chop hard boiled eggs for a salad, mash them using a potato masher.,"

Keep cold food ice cold.,
Keep hot food hot.,
Make it hot.",How to Keep Food Safe at a Tailgate Party2," It's absolutely vital that your cold stuff stays cold. To this end:


Use an appliance thermometer to make sure your food stays below 40ºF/4.4ºC. Food that doesn't stay cold will start to go bad within two hours.
Use thermally lined/insulated picnic/lunch bags or coolers to keep foods cool. Add ice packs or ice to keep it even cooler. The food should be packed into these the moment it is removed from the refrigerator. Always allow for thorough chilling time if you're baking or cooking foods to take.
If you have a vehicle/portable fridge, keep your cold foods in it until they're ready to be used.

, If you're bringing hot food to the tailgate party, you must keep it hot.


To keep food like soup hot, take your insulated container, fill it with boiling water and let it sit for 2 minutes. Empty it and then fill the container with the piping hot food. This will keep the food steaming for several hours.

, Meat and poultry need to reach the correct internal temperature while grilling. So get out your food thermometer, and check the temperature before you serve:


Hamburger patties and pork need to reach at least 160ºF/71.1ºC
Chicken needs to hit a smoking hot 170ºF/76.6ºC before serving
Beef, lamb, and pork need to be cooked to 165ºF/73.8ºC
Medium rare beef, veal, and lamb steaks need to be cooked to 145ºF/62.7ºC
Poultry breast meat needs to be cooked to 170ºF/76.6ºC
Dark meat needs to be cooked to 180ºF/82.2ºC
All pork needs to be cooked to 160ºF/71.10C.

"
"
Pack properly.,
Stay clean.,
Consider purchasing food right before serving it.,
Grill carefully.",How to Keep Food Safe at a Tailgate Party3," How you pack the food is an important part of preventing the spread of contaminants from one food to another.


Pack all meats separately from ready-to-eat foods. Juices from the meat could spoil food like cheese and vegetables, so be sure to wrap securely.
Pack dairy produce on its own, inside a cooler.
When you bring food back home, discard any food that has come into contact with other food; this includes shared dishes that have had forks and the like stuck into them, as you have no idea what guests had on their utensils.

, Anytime you touch raw meat clean your hands before touching food, both for preparation and for serving. Clean them again after touching the food.


Use moist towelettes thoroughly to make sure that you don't transmit germs or bacteria onto other foods or utensils. Provide plenty of spare towelettes and antibacterial cleanser for guests to use too––place in an obvious spot.
Wipe down everything before you serve.
Use only clean utensils for serving and eating with.

, This doesn't mean buying it from the pricey vendors; it means stopping at the nearest supermarket before you enter the tailgate party, stocking up and placing the foods into the appropriate containers at the supermarket carpark. If you can reduce the travel time for the food, so much the better.


Avoid purchasing more than what will be eaten––that way, there will be no temptation to hoard leftovers and eat them later, when they have turned bad.
Take your cooler bag into the supermarket. Place food items straight into it from the refrigerator shelf, then open it at the cashier for purchase and ask that it be repacked straight back into the cooler.

, When grilling, only remove the amount of meat that can fit on the grill. Leave the rest in the cooler until it's time to cook the next round. After grilling food, serve immediately. Anything that is not eaten straight away should be kept hot or placed into a cooler.


Grilled food left outside for more than hour should be discarded.
Refer back to the section above for the heating temperatures required.

Choose healthy tortilla chips.,
Limit the amount of cheese.,
Choose low-cholesterol toppings.,
Eat beans.,
Use spicy elements.,
Replace sour cream with guacamole.,
Choose corn tortillas.",How to Enjoy Mexican Food on a Cholesterol‐Lowering Diet1," You don’t have get rid of tortilla chips completely on a low cholesterol diet. Choose healthy multigrain chips or natural chips with few ingredients. Look for chips that only contain corn, oil, and salt. Many tortilla chips have no cholesterol, so read the label.


Corn does not contain cholesterol, so any cholesterol in a chip comes from the fat used to fry the chip (often lard). Check the ingredients to find out what the chip was fried in — avocado oil, canola oil, flaxseed oil, olive oil, peanut oil are all oils that can actually help lower your cholesterol.
Instead of eating tortilla chips with cheese sauces, try fresh salsa, pico, or guacamole.;
, Many Mexican dishes contain high amounts of cheese, which can be full of cholesterol. When making Mexican food at home, leave out the cheese completely. Instead, top with fresh veggies.If you need some cheese, sprinkle a small amount of reduced-fat cheese on top of the dish.

, Cheese and full-fat sour cream are not the only toppings for a Mexican dish. So many fresh, cholesterol-free ingredients can be added to the top of tacos, fajitas, and taco salads. Try salsa, pico de gallo, cilantro, tomatoes, and jalapeños.Think outside of the box and add any veggie you like. Try black olives, cucumbers, carrots, bell peppers, onions, broccoli, spinach, roasted eggplant, roasted zucchini and squash, or anything else you enjoy.

, Beans without any added fat can be a tasty and a great addition to a Mexican dish. Cook dried black or pinto beans and add them to salads, tacos, or burritos. Beans can be a healthy source of fiber and protein. Beans can also help lower your cholesterol.Try making healthy refried beans by mashing beans and adding seasoning. Just make sure you skip the oils.

, To add flavor to your Mexican food, experiment with spices. Mexican food is known for its spices and rich flavors. Try jalapeños or habanero peppers if you like spicy foods. Try other spices, like cumin, chili powder, coriander, or garlic.Other spices common to Mexican dishes include oregano, cloves, cinnamon, and allspice.

, If just salsa isn’t enough for you, try getting your creamy texture and taste from guacamole instead of sour cream. Guacamole contains avocado, tomatoes, and spices, which can add a boost of flavor to your dish without added cholesterol.Try slicing up some avocado and put it into all of your dishes.

, Corn tortillas are much healthier than flour tortillas. Corn tortillas generally have lower fat and cholesterol contents, along with fewer added ingredients. Flour tortillas generally have more calories and fat, and they contain many more ingredients.Read the labels. Many flour tortillas have long lists of ingredients, which include hydrogenated oils, sugar, and other additives. Corn tortillas have fewer ingredients, with some having only corn and water.
You may also try whole wheat tortillas, but make sure to read the labels. While spinach, whole grain, tomato, or whole wheat tortillas may appear healthy, they may be full of hydrogenated  oils and unhealthy additives.
Hard or soft shells don't matter as long as you read the ingredients to make sure you get shells with minimal and healthy ingredients.
Consider making your own homemade tortillas. This way you can control what you put into them.

Boil water.,
Place the lemons in a colander.,
Pour the boiling water over the lemons.,
Scrub the fruit with a vegetable brush.,
Rinse well.,
Dry thoroughly.",How to Dewax Lemons1," Fill a kettle halfway with water and bring the water to a boil on the stove.


You could use a small saucepan instead of a kettle. Fill the saucepan halfway with water and boil it on the stove over high heat.
If necessary, you could use hot tap water instead of boiled water. Make sure that the tap water is as hot as possible before pouring it over the lemons.;
, As the water is heating up, arrange the lemons in a colander, keeping them in a single layer. Place the colander in your kitchen sink.


It's best to work with only a few lemons at a time so that they can move around freely in the bottom of the colander. If you pile the lemons together, less of the peel will be visible, making it more difficult for the hot water to come into contact with the wax.

, Once the water in your kettle reaches a boil, pour it over the lemons in your colander.The heat of the water will partially melt the wax, loosening it from the peel and making it easier to strip away.

, Use a vegetable brush to gently scrub the outer peel of each lemon. Hold the lemon under cool, running water as you scrub.


Scrub the lemons one at a time.
It is important to use cold water. The boiling water heated the lemon peel, and the cold water quickly drops it back down to a more suitable temperature.
Avoid using a brush or scrubbing sponge used for dishes. Soap residue inside the brush could get onto the fruit and contaminate the peel.

, Give each lemon a final rinse to remove any additional wax residue.


Lightly scrub the peel with your fingers during this step.

, Gently wipe the outside of each lemon with a clean paper towel to dry the peel.


You could also allow the lemons to air dry on your kitchen counter instead of using paper towels.
Only store dewaxed lemons after they have been thoroughly dry.

Grab some cold dairy.,
Avoid drinking water to cool your mouth.,
Swig alcohol.,
Use other oils to cool the burn.,
Eat starches.,
Try folk remedies.",How to Cool Burns from Chili Peppers1," Instead of water, drink milk! The fat and oil in dairy products will lessen the burn by dissolving the capsaicin.Grab a cup of whole milk, and down it all. Make sure you rinse your mouth well first.As another option, you could choose a dairy product like full-fat sour cream or yogurt.
Milk works almost like a soap by dissolving the capsaicin and reducing the burning sensation in your mouth. There's a protein found in milk called casein that acts like a detergent against capsaicin. The burning sensation in chili peppers comes from capsaicinoids, which are a family of molecules.Ice cream can also help. Anything with dairy in it could help ease the burning sensation you’re experiencing. Coconut milk works very well to cut the burn and modulate the heat level of a spicy recipe.;
, Believe it or not, but the heat is not going to go away if you drink water. In fact, it will actually spread the capsaicin around your mouth and make the burning feel worse.


Soda is largely made of water and also won’t work. Drinking coffee will make it worse, because of the heat in the coffee. Capsaicin has oil-like qualities, which is why it repels water.The burning sensation in your mouth from chili peppers probably won’t last as long as it does on your hands. It’s caused when the capsaicin bonds with the mouth’s pain receptors due to a chemical reaction.
The nerve cells notice when the temperature in your mouth gets above 108 degrees Fahrenheit, which capsaicin tricks the neurons into reacting to.

, Beer won’t work as well because it’s largely water, but some harder alcohols will remove the burning sensation from your mouth.


Take a few sips of vodka. In addition to reducing the burning sensation, it’s likely to make you feel pretty mellow as long as you don’t drink too much!
Alcohol will cool the burning sensation you get from touching chili peppers too. Many different types of spirits will work.
Always be cautious when drinking. Don't drink too much, don't drink if you're underage, and don't drink and drive.

, Ingesting olive oil or vegetable oil will help cool the burn in your mouth by coating your tongue.


These oils or peanut butter are high in fat and oil, so they make good choices for natural remedies.
The fat and oil in these ingredients disintegrate the heat in the chili peppers, alleviating the burning sensation you're feeling.
It might sound counter intuitive, but you need to combat chili oil with other oil, which is why guzzling water is not as effective as vegetable or olive oil.

, Eat starches if your mouth is burning from ingesting chili peppers. They should give you some relief.


Although starches like rice and bread aren’t going to be as effective at dissolving the capsaicin as fats, oils or alcohol, they will help cool the burn.
There is a reason that many cultures serve spicy food alongside white rice (or potatoes). This is common in many Asian and Indian cultures.
Eating a spoonful of sugar can also dull the burning sensation. Mix a tablespoon of sugar into a 9 ounce glass of water, and gargle with it. Alternatively, put a teaspoon of honey on your tongue.

, Many people say that different vegetables or food items are cures for chili pepper burns in the mouth.


Eat some cucumber. This is a common way to deal with too much heat in food served in Indonesia and Thailand. Eat a banana - the texture and sugar content may help soothe the burn as well.
Eat some chocolate. The high fat content in most chocolate bars will help remove some of the capsaicin from your mouth. Milk chocolate generally has a higher fat content and a higher casein content than dark chocolate and therefore should give better relief.
Touch the affected area with a soft corn tortilla (lips, mouth, etc.) Try eating a raw carrot. Just take a bite, and the burn will significantly diminish.
White toothpaste can significantly reduce the burning from habanero oils on the skin. It will likely work in the mouth and/or with other peppers. Eat a lemon wedge, juiced or whole (with all juice), and the acid will help breakdown the oily stuff.

Understand the effect.,
Start with more water.,
Boil food for longer times.,
Consider using a pressure cooker.",How to Boil Water4," Moving up from sea level, the air gets thinner and thinner. With fewer air molecules to push the water down, each water molecule has an easier time breaking away from the others and entering the air. In other words, it takes less heat to get the water boiling. The water will boil sooner, but the low temperature will make it harder to cook food.









You don't need to worry about this effect unless you're at 2,000 ft (610m) or higher.

, Since liquids evaporate faster at higher altitudes you should also add a little extra water to compensate. If you're planning to cook food in the water, you should add even more water. The food will require a longer cooking time, so more water than you're used to will boil away.








, To make up for the lower temperature, you can cook the food for a longer amount of time. Here's a simple rule for how much time to add:








If the recipe would take less than 20 minutes to boil at sea level, add 1 minute of cooking time for each 1,000 ft (305m) above sea level.
If the recipe would take more than 20 minutes to boil at sea level, add 2 minutes for each 1,000 ft (305m) above sea level.

, At especially high altitudes, cooking in boiling water can take an unreasonably long time. Boil water a pressure cooker instead. This traps the water under an airtight lid, and raises the pressure so the water can reach higher temperatures. In a pressure cooker, you can follow the recipe as though you were cooking at sea level.

Be extra careful if you are in a high-risk group.",How to Avoid Food Poisoning," Food safety begins at the grocery store, so make sure to shop wisely:


Check the use-by dates on all products and use your judgement to decide if foods have been stored at the correct temperatures.
Pack meat and poultry products into separate bags and do not let the raw flesh touch any other food products as you shop or bring them home.;
, Keep cold and frozen foods as cold as possible, especially when transferring from the store to your home:


Wrap the goods in newspaper or buy a small cooler bag to transport your cold and frozen foods home.
When possible, leave grabbing cold products to the end of your shopping.
Store all foods properly and quickly when you get back home.

, Wash your hands thoroughly with hot water and antibacterial soap before and after preparing food, especially after handling raw meat.


Keep dish cloths and hand towels regularly cleaned to prevent bacteria from accumulating on the fabric.

Always wash your hands after handling pets (especially reptiles, turtles and birds) and after using the bathroom or handling pet litter.

, It's very important to keep your kitchen counters and other food preparation areas clean, especially when preparing high-risk food items like meat, poultry and eggs.


It's not necessary to use a disinfectant, a mild solution of hot water and soap will sufficiently clean your counters, cutting boards and utensils.
Also make sure to rinse down sinks after washing raw meat products -- you don't want bacteria being transferred to any clean dishes.

, Keep these boards separate to avoid any possibility of cross-contamination of bacteria from meat to other food products.


If you cannot keep separate chopping boards, make sure to disinfect a multi-purpose chopping board thoroughly after each use (see bleach recipe in ""Tips"").
Plastic chopping boards are recommended over wooden chopping boards, as the wooden ones are harder to clean.

, You should never defrost food (especially meat and poultry) at room temperature just to speed up the process.


Food should always be thawed in the refrigerator, as thawing at room temperature allows the surface of the food to warm up too quickly, promoting bacteria growth.
Alternatively, you can defrost foods using the ""defrost"" or ""50 percent power"" setting on your microwave. You can also safely defrost food by holding them under cold running water.Once foods have been completely thawed, they should be used promptly -- they should never be refrozen without being cooked first.

, This is especially important for red meat, poultry and eggs, which are considered high-risk foods.



Cooking these foods all the way through will destroy harmful germs. Consult a cookbook fr the correct cooking times (taking the weight of the food and the temperature of your oven into account).
Use a meat thermometer if you have any doubts about how long to cook something -- this can take a lot of the uncertainty out of cooking meats. Chicken and turkey are cooked when they reach a temperature of 165°F, steaks are cooked at 145°F and hamburgers are coked at 160°F., Bacteria multiply fastest between 40°F and 140°F, so it's important to keep foods either above or below these temperatures.


You should make sure your fridge is set at a temperature of 4°C/ 40°F or less and that cooked food reaches a temperature of at least 165°F

, Leftovers that have been reheated poorly can still contain active food pathogens. Moreover, if leftovers have gone bad, no amount of reheating will make them safe.


Do not keep leftovers for too long. Any signs of discoloration, sliminess, growth of mold etc. are signals to discard or compost the leftovers.
Never reheat leftovers more than once and never refreeze food without changing its state! (i.e. you can safely freeze raw food, defrost the raw food, cook the food, refreeze the cooked food and defrost/reheat the cooked food. However, if any of the reheated cooked food is left over, throw it away or there is a very high chance of getting sick!

, The type of storage is dependent on the type of food.


Dry foods such as pasta, rice, lentils, beans, canned foods and cereals can all be kept in a cool, dry place such as a pantry or cupboards.
Other foods can be trickier and care should be taken to store them in the appropriate manner:

, Place frozen items in the freezer within 2 hours of removing them from the freezer (though ideally this should be done sooner—put them away as soon as you get home).


Meat, poultry, eggs, fish, pre-prepared meals, dairy products and leftovers should always be refrigerated.
Many foods should be kept refrigerated or in a cool, dark place, such as a cellar or pantry, once opened. Read labels for storage details and instructions. If in any doubt, always err on the side of providing a cooler environment.

, Food -- particularly raw meats and leftovers should never be stored in open container.


Tightly cover all foods with cling wrap or tin foil, place in a container with an airtight lid, or store in a sealable plastic bag.
Never store food in opened tin cans, as this forms a breeding ground for bacteria. Transfer things like tomato paste and sweetcorn to a plastic container instead.

, All foods, regardless of their storage status, should be eaten quickly and within their use-by dates.


Even spices and dried herbs lose their beneficial properties and flavors if kept too long and many items can become harmful if stored beyond their use-by date.
Never eat foods from dented or bulging tins or from packaging with a broken seal, even if the food is within its use-by date., At all times, keep raw meat, raw eggs and poultry away from cooked food, fresh fruits, and vegetables.


Store raw meat covered, on the bottom shelf of your refrigerator. This will prevent it from touching or dripping onto other foods., Food can easily become contaminated if it easily accessible to pets and pests.


Proper food storage -- keeping food in sealed containers in a closed fridge, freezer or cupboard -- will help to keep insects and animals away.
However, food is more susceptible to contamination by four-legged beasts during preparation and serving. Don't leave food unattended during the preparation process and keep completed dishes covered with lids or cling wrap until they are ready to be served.

, Food contamination from bacteria occurs much faster in warmer weather.


If you are eating outdoors, ensure that everyone eats the food quickly and that leftovers are brought back inside within an hour to be stored in the cool again.

, Wash with hot water and antibacterial soap and dry thoroughly using a clean hand towel.

, Pasteurized foods have been through a process that kills germs.


If milk and fruit juices are pasteurized, it will usually say so on the label. You should also avoid food products made with unpasteurized milk, such as certain cheeses.
However, commercial juices and juice concentrates that are sold at room temperature and have an extended shelf life are pasteurized, even if the label doesn't say so.

, This will help to ensure that harmful germs haven't had the time to grow.


Follow the ""2-2-4"" rule when it comes to leftovers -- don't leave food out for more than two hours after cooking, refrigerate food in containers no deeper than two inches and throw away leftovers that are more than four days old.

, Foods that are not cooked before they are eaten, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, should be rinsed in water and even scrubbed or peeled where necessary.


You should even wash raw produce if you plan on peeling it afterwards, as contaminants from the skin can be transferred to the flesh during peeling.
However, you shouldn't wash pre-washed bags of lettuce and other greens, as the extra washing risks introducing new contaminants to the already-clean produce., Sushi, steak tartare etc. are delicacies that can delight if properly prepared. However, the highest level of hygiene must be ensured for these items. Only eat these items at reputable places!


Avoid sushi, raw clams and similar foods that are sitting in a buffet table if you don't know how long they have been without proper refrigeration. If you make them at home, use the best and freshest ingredients, follow all hygienic practices outlined here and eat immediately upon creation.
Note that fresh doesn't necessarily mean ""straight from the animal,"" as deep frozen sushi fish is substantially safer than fresh-killed fish, since the deep freezing kills parasite spores.
Raw flesh foods are extremely difficult to prepare properly and safely, so if in doubt, don't make them yourself. Never keep raw flesh foods as leftovers.

, Raw eggs are one of the most common culprits behind food poisoning outbreaks.


This is due to the relatively high frequency of salmonella bacteria developing in raw eggs.
Avoid using raw eggs in healthy smoothies or shakes to increase their protein content -- use an egg substitute or protein powder instead.
Beware of eating foods that contain raw eggs, such as uncooked cookie dough or cake batter -- even a small nibble could make you sick., Eating raw shellfish is an extraordinary risk, although raw clams and oysters are considered a delicacy. There are several risk factors particular to shellfish that make it much more dangerous than raw fish:


Red tide and other naturally occurring microbial outbreaks can contaminate shellfish, which build up toxins in their flesh. Risk of hepatitis is high and alcoholics and persons with liver damage are particularly at risk.
If you do eat raw shellfish, make sure they are alive when you purchase them. This means that mussels, clams and oysters will have closed shells, or the shells close when tapped. If the shell is open, throw it away.

, Every year, people become sick after eating at restaurants, delis and diners that fail to maintain basic food safety and hygiene standards. Therefore it's important to be vigilant about food safety even (or especially) when eating out.



Check the premises. The hygiene standard should be fairly self-evident. Always take a look at the bathrooms before dining -- if they're dirty, it's a reasonable assumption that the kitchen is too.

Be careful with buffet-style food. Check to see that hot food is being kept hot and not just lukewarm. Rice can be a source of food contamination if it has been left out for too long. Salads are also a possible problem if they are not fresh.

Be careful with some salad dressings. Mayonnaise, Hollandaise, Bearnaise and other sauces which contain raw egg, as well as meringue.

Send back undercooked foods.If you are served an undercooked meat or egg dish, don't feel bad about sending it back to the kitchen and requesting it be cooked further -- also remember to ask for a fresh plate.

, Trust your senses! If it looks unusual, smells bad, or otherwise worries you, leave it.


Even if you have followed all of the precautions outlined above, if the food doesn't taste right or makes you nauseous, stop eating and (politely) get it out of your mouth.
It's better to be safe than sorry!

, Food poisoning is caused by ingesting food or drink that has been contaminated with either:


Chemicals such as insecticides or food toxins including fungi (e.g. poisonous mushrooms).
Or gastrointestinal infections of bacteria, viruses or parasites.
Most people refer to food poisoning as covering any of those possible sources., Environmental factors and the food growing process can both play a role in the transfer of potential food-contaminating bacteria.


The use of chemicals, fertilizers, manures etc. all have the potential to contaminate food as it is being grown. Never hold an expectation that an item is washed before it leaves the farm.
Bacteria, parasites etc. travel happily in the wind, float in the water, hitch lifts with dust and reside snugly in the soil. They are a part of nature's web of life and will always be a possible source of contamination if not dealt with appropriately as part of a consistent and dedicated approach to food hygiene.

, Whether in a large factory or in your own kitchen, food processing can be a major source of contamination.


Areas used for processing need to be kept scrupulously clean or cross-contamination can easily occur, especially with meat products.
Natural bacteria residing in the intestines of animals are a major source of cross-contamination when mishandled).

, Incorrectly stored food can be the culprit behind transferring contaminants from one food to another.


This is a very tricky area because often people don't think that certain foods could be a source of contamination and are unaware that cross-contamination has occurred.
For instance, if an uncooked chicken thigh was left resting next to a bunch of grapes, this could be a possible cause of contamination and food poisoning.

, A great deal of food contamination occurs during the preparation stage.


A sick person can pass on germs, from 'flu to gastroenteritis.
A chopping board used for meat that is not washed and then used for vegetables is another source of possible contamination.
Unwashed hands, dirty kitchen spaces, insects and rodents in the kitchen etc. are all possible sources of food contamination.

, If you've every experienced food poisoning, you'll know how unpleasant it is.


The symptoms may vary slightly depending on the severity of the poisoning, but most people will experience some combination of the following: nausea and vomiting, Watery diarrhea (potentially with bleeding), abdominal pain and cramps, fever.
The symptoms may start as soon as several hours after eating the contaminated food, or as late as several weeks afterwards. Food poisoning generally lasts between one and ten days.
See your doctor if you can't keep liquids down or become dehydrated, see blood in your vomit, experience diarrhea for more than three days, experience extreme abdominal pain, or have an oral temperature higher than 101.5 F., People in certain high-risk groups, such as pregnant women, very young children, people with weakened immune systems and the elderly should be extra careful to avoid food poisoning.


The results of food poisoning can be a lot more severe for people in these groups and it can even cause fetal abnormalities in pregnant women.
People in these groups should take extra precautions, such as avoiding soft cheeses (like feta, brie and Camembert), avoiding or thoroughly reheating deli meats, and being extra vigilant about reheating foods until they are steaming hot."

Understand the potential dangers of eating undercooked beans and know the symptoms.,
Give yourself enough time to cook beans.,
Know the cooking times for the types of beans you're cooking.,
Prefer canned beans.,
Get a pressure cooker.",How to Avoid Food Poisoning from Undercooked Beans," Poisoning by undercooked beans usually results in abdominal pain and can also lead to diarrhea and in some uncommon cases, hospitalization. However, recovery is usually rapid and spontaneous. If you have consumed undercooked beans, these may some of the symptoms:


Nausea
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Gas
Abdominal pain.;
, Rushing the cooking process of the beans is not going to benefit you any, instead, it is better to cook the beans properly and to refrigerate them for tomorrow night's dinner, than to rush them and eat them underdone for tonight's meal.


Have standby grains such as couscous and burghul wheat for a quick soak should the beans not be ready and you still need a substantial side dish of plant origin protein.

, These can vary according to the bean and you should know both the type of bean you're cooking and the length of time it requires to be both soaked (if relevant) and cooked for. Phytohaemagglutinin is found in its highest concentration in red kidney beans, so they're the ones to be the most careful about. Here are some cooking times to be aware of for each 1 cup of dried beans:Adzuki: No soaking time needed, boil for 45-50 minutes or pressure cook for 15-20 minutes.

Black (turtle) beans: Soak overnight, boil for 45-60 minutes, pressure cook for 15-20 minutes.

Black-eyed pea: Soak overnight, boil for 1 hour, pressure cook for 10 minutes.

Chickpeas or garbanzo beans: Soak overnight, boil for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, pressure cook for 15-20 minutes.
Fava or broad beans: Soak overnight, cook for 45-60 minutes. Don't pressure cook. Also note that some people are unable to consume fava beans if they have a Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency as this causes the disease favism.

Kidney beans: Soak overnight, cook for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, pressure cook for 10 minutes. This is the bean to be very careful with as it has the highest levels of phytohaemagglutinin out of all beans.

Red lentils: No soaking needed, cook 20-30 minutes or pressure cook 5-7 minutes. Always wash well and sieve to remove pieces of debris.

Green or brown lentils: No soaking needed, cook 30-45 minutes or pressure cook for 6-8 minutes.

Lima beans: Soak overnight and cook for 60-90 minutes. Don't use a pressure cooker.

Mung beans: Soak overnight, cook 1 - 1 1/2 hours, pressure cook for 8-10 minutes.

Split pea: No soaking needed, cook for 35-40 minutes, don't pressure cook.

Pinto beans: Soak overnight, cook for 1 1/2 hours, pressure cook for 10 minutes.

Soybean: Soak overnight, cook for 3 hours, pressure cook for 15 minutes.
White (Great Northern, Marrow, Navy, Pea) beans: Soak overnight, cook for 45-60 minutes, pressure cook for 4-5 minutes.

, If you just don't have the time or patience for cooking your own beans, let someone else do the cooking for you and purchase pre-cooked canned beans.

, Pressure cookers can speed up bean cooking time if you're in a hurry. Follow the cooker's accompanying instructions carefully.

Make a rub for roast turkey.",How to Make a Rub for a Roast,"


Chicken pairs well with citrus and herbs. To make a rub for a roast chicken combine 1 tbsp. (15 ml) salt free lemon pepper, 1 tbsp. (15 ml) dried thyme, 1/2 tsp. (7 ml) granulated garlic and 1/4 tsp. (1 ml) salt in a small bowl. Combine the spices and then generously rub the chicken with the spice mixture. Roast the chicken at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) for about 45 to 60 minutes for a whole chicken or until the internal temperature of the chicken (check the thickest part of the chicken such as the thigh) reaches 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).;
,


Rosemary and garlic are a natural compliment to pork and make a wonderful spice rub. Combine 2 tbsp. (30 ml) dried rosemary, 1 tbsp. (15 ml) granulated garlic, 1/2 tsp. (5 ml) salt, 1/4 tsp. (1 ml) ground pepper and 1/4 tsp. (1 ml) dried chili flakes. Rub this mixture over the pork to be roasted and cook it at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) or until the internal temperature has reached at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) and let it rest for 3 minutes until serving. Cooking time will depend on the size and cut of the roast.

,


Roast beef can accommodate much more assertive flavors in a dry rub. Combine 2 tbsp. (30 ml) granulated garlic, 2 tbsp. (30 ml) dark chili powder, 1 tsp. (5 ml) dried mustard powder, 1 tbsp. (15 ml) dried oregano, 1/4 tsp. (1 ml) ground pepper and 1/2 tsp. (5 ml) coarse salt. Rub evenly over the beef and cook in a preheated 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) oven for about 20 minutes for each 1 lb. (450 g) of meat for boneless cuts and about 25 minutes for each 1 lb. (450 g) of meat from a bone-in cut. This will result in rare meat; adjust cooking time for your desired level of doneness.

,


Turkey pairs well with less aggressive flavors. Combine 2 tbsp. (30 ml) dried thyme, 2 tbsp. (30 ml) granulated garlic, 2 tbsp. (30 ml) poultry seasoning and 1/4 tsp. (1 ml) ground pepper. Rub over the turkey and roast the turkey at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C) for approximately 20 to 25 minutes for each 1 lb. (450 g) of turkey or just until the internal temperature of the thickest part of the turkey has reached 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

Make chicken or shrimp fajitas.,
Eat chicken or fish tacos with corn tortillas.,
Prepare a Mexican salad.,
Make a burrito.",How to Enjoy Mexican Food on a Cholesterol‐Lowering Diet2," Fajitas can be a tasty and healthy Mexican dish. Make sure that you use grilled chicken or shrimp instead of beef to help lower the cholesterol content. Fajitas don’t come with cheese, so the dish is fairly low in cholesterol.Add onions, green peppers, lettuce, and tomatoes as cholesterol-friendly toppings.
Make sure to put them on corn tortillas instead of flour tortillas. They are healthier. Flour tortillas often contain hidden unhealthy ingredients, such as hydrogenated oils.

, Tacos can healthy if made the correct way. Filling them with grilled chicken or fish or sauteed shrimp is healthier than hamburger meat or steak. Skip the sour cream and cheese. Instead, add roasted vegetables, black olives, tomatoes, or any other fresh vegetable. Top with salsa or cilantro.Choose a corn tortilla instead of flour. Make sure the corn tortillas you get are natural with minimal ingredients, like corn and salt, instead of a bunch of unhealthy additives. Flour tortillas are also not a healthy option.

, Taco or fajita salads can be a tasty way to enjoy Mexican food on a low-cholesterol diet. Skip the unhealthy flour salad shell. Instead, use spinach or lettuce as the base. Add some Spanish rice or plain black beans to that, along with grilled meat and fresh toppings.Sprinkle a small amount of reduced-fat cheese on top if you want it. You may also add a small amount of low-fat sour cream.

, Burritos can be enjoyed even if you are on a low-cholesterol diet. Fill it with grilled meat, like chicken, shrimp, or fish. Add fresh, whole black beans, corn, brown rice, veggies, and salsa. Skip the cheese and sour cream.Wrap the burrito in a natural, whole grain tortilla. Read the label to check for unnecessary added unhealthy ingredients, like hydrogenated oils.
Try replacing sour cream with plain, low-fat yogurt for that creamy texture.

Skip the chips.,
Avoid dishes with cheese.,
Beware of salads.,
Ask for no refried beans.,
Go for grilled meats.",How to Enjoy Mexican Food on a Cholesterol‐Lowering Diet3," When you are at a Mexican restaurant, don’t eat the tortilla chips. The ones you get in restaurants are fried in lard, which is not good for a low cholesterol diet. Even eating a few can be bad for your diet.Ask your server not to bring them to the table so you won’t be tempted.

, When eating out, stay away from dishes that contain large amounts of cheese. Don’t get a quesadilla or a cheese enchilada, which contain a lot of cheese. If you are ordering a dish that contains cheese, like a taco or burrito, ask for no cheese or for the cheese to be placed on the side.Avoid dishes in heavy cheese sauces. Instead, go for dishes with no sauce or a tomato sauce.
Skip the queso dip. Eat salsa or guacamole instead.

, When you eat out, be careful of ordering a salad. People often think that salads are always healthy because they are salads. Many salads you find in restaurants are full of unhealthy ingredients, like fried shells, fried meats, cheese and cheese sauces, and sour cream.Read the ingredients of the salads very carefully. Ask for grilled meat instead of friend, and ask for no sour cream or cheese if possible. Don’t eat the tortilla, or as for it to be left out completely.

, When order a platter, ask that they do not add refried beans. Refried beans are cooked with lard, which is not good for a low cholesterol diet. Instead, ask for Spanish rice, whole beans, or skip the sides completely.You may also want to ask for a bed of lettuce in place of rice or beans.

, As you look at the menu, browse for dishes that have grilled meat options. Many dishes have fried meats or meats cooked in oil or lard, which may have a lot of cholesterol. Instead, choose dishes that contain grilled meats for a healthier and tasty option.For example, grilled shrimp and grilled chicken are common options on Mexican menus. You may also be able to find grilled fish.

Place the lemons on a microwave-safe plate.,
Microwave for 10 to 20 seconds.Place the plate of fruit in the microwave.,
Scrub the fruit under running water.,
Rinse the lemons.,
Dry using paper towels.",How to Dewax Lemons2," Arrange the lemons on a microwavable plate or in a microwavable dish. Keep them in an even, single layer.

Work with only a few lemons at a time for best results.
Do not stack the lemons on the plate. Stacking them can result in uneven heating, which may make it difficult to fully strip away the wax.

, Run the microwave on high for 10 to 20 seconds, depending on how many lemons you are working with.


If you are only working with one or two lemons, only microwave them for 10 seconds. If you are working with three to six lemons, increase the amount of time to 20 seconds.
The heat helps melt the wax. The softened wax will be easier to remove from the peel.

, Using a vegetable brush, lightly scrub the peel of each lemon while holding it under cool, running water.


It's best to scrub the lemons one at a time.
Cool to cold water is ideal since it can cool down the lemon peels after they were heated in the microwave.
Do not use a vegetable brush previously used with soapy water.

, Stop scrubbing and rinse each lemon one last time under the running water.


You can use your fingers to lightly scrub the peel during this step, but do not use the vegetable brush.

, After washing each lemon, pat it dry with clean paper towels.


The lemons can also be air dried on the kitchen counter, but do not store them while they remain wet.

Combine vinegar and water.,
Spray the solution onto the lemons.,
Scrub the lemons under running water.,
Rinse under cool water.,
Dry well.",How to Dewax Lemons3," Pour three parts water and one part white distilled vinegar in a spray bottle. Close the bottle, then shake well to combine.A commercial fruit and vegetable wash could be used instead of a homemade one.
Another possible fruit and vegetable wash can be made by mixing 1 Tbsp (15 ml) fresh lemon juice, 1 Tbsp (15 ml), and 1 cup (250 ml) lukewarm water. Mix these ingredients together in a spray bottle., Thoroughly douse all sides of the peel of each lemon with the vinegar cleaning solution.


Allow the solution to sit on the lemons for two to five minutes before continuing. The acidity of the cleansing solution needs several minutes to weaken and dissolve the wax.

, Scrub the lemon peels with a vegetable brush under cool, running water, applying gentle yet firm pressure.


The temperature of the water is not as significant for this method since no heat was used previously, but lukewarm to cool water is still recommended since it is the least likely to alter the internal temperature of the lemon.
Avoid using brushes or sponges that were previously used in soapy water.
Each lemon only needs to be scrubbed briefly.

, After you finish scrubbing the lemons, rinse each one under the running water to remove any remaining wax residue.


If you see any wax debris, you can use your fingers to lightly brush it off while rinsing the fruit. Do not use the brush during this step, however.

, Quickly dry the lemons by wiping off any water using clean paper towels.


If desired, you can let the lemons air dry instead of drying them with paper towel.
Do not store dewaxed lemons that are still wet.

Use dish soap on hands or skin.,
Use alcohol to cool your hands or other areas of the skin.,
Put your hands in a bowl of milk.,
Put oil on your hands or other areas of your skin that are affected.,
Cool stinging eyes from chili peppers.",How to Cool Burns from Chili Peppers2," You can run for the hand soap, but dish soap will be more effective at dissolving the oils in chili peppers. Many people report a painful burning feeling on their skin if it comes into contact with chili pepper oil.


You could also try periodically dipping your fingers into a mixture of water and bleach (5 to 1 water to bleach) as you cut the chili peppers.
The bleach turns the capsaicin into water-soluble salt. You can then rinse it away with water.
Take care to not get any bleach on the peppers, though. Wash your hands with the dish soap when you are done cutting the peppers.

, Chili oil and capsaicin, the culprits when it comes to the burning sensation, are soluble in alcohol.


Splash rubbing alcohol on your hands. Even if you use other methods to cool your hands, you could start with rubbing alcohol to cleanse them.Reach for the liquor cabinet, and choose a high-proof alcohol like vodka. Rub it on your hands or other affected body parts to wash away the burning oils.
Another possibility is to make a baking soda paste out of baking soda and water. Smear it on your hands, and wait for it to dry before washing it off.

, Choose ice-cold milk. Try adding ice cubes to the bowl. Plunging your hands in a bowl of ice water can work instead, but it’s not as effective.


Some people report that the burning sensation from chili peppers is painful and can last for a couple hours, so it’s understandable if you want an immediate remedy.
Try adding flour to the bowl of milk to create a pair of paste gloves. Leave it on for several minutes before washing it away.
Put rubbing alcohol on your hands before putting them into ice water or milk. Milk is best, and cold milk is better yet., The hot chili oils will dissolve with other kinds of oil, lessening the burning sensation.You could also reach for the Vaseline, and put it on your hands.


Rub your hands with a small amount of either vegetable oil or olive oil before you cut the peppers or after your hands start to burn.Don’t use so much oil that your hands become very slippery and create the danger of the knife slipping, though. Be careful when touching other people, such as babies, after getting chili oil on your hands because you can transfer it to them.
Coat your hands lightly with the oil in order to prevent the burning from occurring in the first place. The oil can also cool the burn after you’ve already touched the peppers. Dip your hands in a bowl of olive or vegetable oil., Sometimes people make the major mistake of rubbing their eyes while cutting chili peppers. This can cause a burning sensation in your eyes.


First of all, it's very important not to do this in the first place. However, if you do, soaking the eye area with milk can help.Take a makeup remover pad or a paper towel, and dab it into a small bowl of milk. Then, dab it around the eye area, much as you would a compress.
You may need to repeat this process several times to get enough relief, as the pepper oil will likely burn for a while. If the burning doesn't go away or affects your vision, see a doctor.
If the burning persists, you could also fashion an eye sling out of cotton balls or paper towels, and wear it for a few hours. Use a butterfly clip and gauze.

"
"
Wear gloves.,
Use a sandwich baggie as makeshift gloves.,
Embrace the burn.",How to Cool Burns from Chili Peppers3," If you’re going to be cooking with hot peppers and you don’t wear gloves, you may get what are called “hot pepper hands.”


Your hands will burn and sting, and you should take care not to touch your eyes after your hands contact chili oil! The best solution is to wear vinyl or latex gloves.
You can be burned similarly by Thai chilis, serranos, or habaneros.The burning comes from the chili oils and capsaicin that is contained in the peppers. It would be even worse if you touched your eyes with contact lenses in. You’ll have to deal with a burning sensation that is uncomfortable.

, Don’t have gloves lying around? It’s better to make gloves out of things you have lying around than to go without.


Put a plastic sandwich baggie over your hands before you cut the peppers. You might want to fasten it to your wrist with a rubber band.
If you don't have gloves or plastic baggies, wrap your hands in paper towels - anything to prevent the chili oil from contacting bare skin.
To protect your eyes, wear clear safety glasses and always wash your hands and nail beds thoroughly after handling hot peppers.

, It’s not fun to have a burning mouth, but there’s some evidence that eating chili peppers on a regular basis is good for your health.Instead of reaching for the sugar, when your energy is lagging, reach for the chili peppers!
However, just because you reduce the burning sensation in your mouth doesn’t mean that you won’t still get the metabolic boost from the capsaicin in the peppers; you likely will since the liver enzymes break it down.
Capsaicin can increase both energy and metabolic levels, helping you to lose weight and generally be healthier."

Prepare oregano from the store.",How to Dry Oregano1,"


Harvest oregano 3 times during the season. Cut fresh oregano leaves with clippers when it is 6 inches (15.24 cm) tall, just before it flowers and in the late summer. This will help the oregano grow tall and strong.
Put fresh leaves you plan to use right away in plastic bags in the refrigerator. When you prepare oregano for storage, you should use the fresh oregano first, because it has the most flavor.
Cut entire stalks with clippers at the end of the summer and tie their bases together with a string.;

A knife that's not sharp will crush the edges, letting the juices seep out instead of making a clean cut. What's more, they'll be prettier, too.








Make sure you're holding it correctly. Your fingers should be curled so your knuckles face outward on top of the handle, close to the blade. Your four fingers should all be on the same side. This is called the ""claw grip"" and it's how chefs do their quick, efficient work.;
, The chiffonade technique is good for all leafy vegetables like lettuce and spinach, but also basil, mint, arugula, or sage. All of these need to rinsed under cold water before beginning.









For basil, keep in mind that you don't really need it until the very end. If you want to hold off on cutting the basil and adding it to your dish, you can. It's delicious raw and the short blast of heat brings out its flavors.That and once you chiffonade, you don't want to give it a chance to brown.

, Start with the largest leaf on the bottom and build up from there. For herbs like basil and mint that are made up of smaller leaves, you can get away with stacking around 8 to 10. For larger leaves, like lettuce, you may want to stick to only three or so.








, Hold the leaves horizontally in front of you and begin wrapping them tightly into a roll. Hold it in place as you pick up your knife with your dominant hand.









This is why you started with the largest leaf on the outside – it'll hold your roll together.

, Begin slicing across the ""cigar"" at a 60° angle. Let your knuckles be your guide (but be careful not to cut yourself).









The closer your cuts, the smaller your shreds will be. Most people chiffonade at about 1/8"" wide (.3 cm).
Use a rocking motion so you don't have to pick up the knife every time; this will seriously speed up your cutting time.
Use a cutting board underneath your leaves to avoid marring your countertop or table.

, Finish slicing the entire roll, down to the pointy edges. Fluff the shreds with your fingertips, separating them from their tangles.









If you cut any stems, discard them now. You only want the leaves as part of your dish.

, It's best to use your ""chiffonaded"" herbs or veggies as soon as possible – the edges may brown and they could lose their flavor if left on the cutting board too long.Sprinkle in as a garnish or dish up alone as soon as possible.








, Olive oil, garlic, cheese, pasta, and basil? Good luck turning that down. Now that you know how to chiffonade your basil, it'll be complete with a beautiful garnish, too.









Never made pesto before? Homemade is definitely the way to go. And you're in luck – wikiHow has an entire category devoted to the creation.

, Gone are the days when you have to daintily shove whole pieces of lettuce in your mouth without dressing dripping down your shirt. Chiffonade your salad beforehand and everything will be automatically bite size.









Not so keen on the salad by itself? This type of cut lettuce is good for a topper to any Mexican food, too. Who said ""healthy tacos"" can't be a thing?

, This dish has every flavor your mouth could want from the savory, juicy chicken to the citrusy, herb-y pasta. This is a balanced, delectable meal that's impressive to boot.









And what's even better? 15 minutes to throw together, and about 20 minutes or so to prepare. You can have an amazing dinner ready to go in much less than an hour.

, In the winter and fall, nothing beats a hearty bowl of soup. Stretch your new skills with this tomato and basil recipe, adding your chiffonaded garnish and whatever else you like (bacon and cheddar anyone?).









This is a healthy meal that can fit many diets. If you up your cooking skills in the herb and veggie department, a boring diet can be turned into something much more sustainable and exciting.

Try to snip straight sprigs, all about the same length, for easier bundling.





;
, Leave a loop on the twine bundle to make hanging your rosemary sprigs easier.


Alternatively, you can use rubber bands to secure your rosemary bundles.






You can combine up to eight sprigs of rosemary per bundle.







, Although you can dry your rosemary outdoors, the National Center for Home Food Preservation recommends drying rosemary indoors for the best color and flavor.


Your porch, attic, or storage cupboard are all good drying options. You can try hanging the rosemary bundles from a clothes hanger, if this is more convenient.






Some people also recommend covering your rosemary with brown paper bags as it dries. This prevents any dust from settling on the rosemary as it dries and also stops any sunlight from bleaching out the color. Just be sure to tear holes in the paper bags to keep the rosemary well ventilated., You'll know the rosemary is dry when all traces of pliability are gone from both stems and leaves. This should take approximately two weeks.


You can also spread your rosemary sprigs or bundles on a flat or slanted window screen, elevated on cinder blocks or wooden blocks, for the best air circulation as they dry.






You won't be able to hang-dry rosemary sprigs in a humid environment, so you may need to dry your rosemary in the oven or in a food dehydrator.







, Once the rosemary has completely dried, place it on a sheet of waxed paper and separate the tough, woody stems from the leaves. Store in an air-tight container in your kitchen cupboard.

Turn the faucet on to a light drizzle so that the stream of water is not so heavy.;
, Use a pair of scissors to snip off the ends of the mint stems. This will allow the herbs to soak up water more easily. Be careful not to cut the mint sprigs too short, or they may not be able to sit properly in the container.Cutting the stems at a slight angle will improve their water intake., Fill a small vase, jar or another shallow container about one-third of the way full. Insert the bundle of mint stems-first into the container so that the snipped ends are completely submerged. The mint will now have a constant supply of water to draw from, increasing its shelf life.Change the water in the container every few days to keep it clean.
For even more pristine preservation, use distilled or mineral water., Drape an empty grocery bag or piece of saran wrap over the top of the mint bundle to keep the herbs from being exposed to the air. Twist the plastic wrap around the base of the container and use a rubber band to secure it. You can then store the mint vertically in the refrigerator, if you have room, or out in the open in the corner of your countertop.When properly covered and given lots of water, your mint will last for weeks, or possibly as long as a month.Refrigerated mint will usually last a few days longer than mint that’s kept at room temperature.

, The ideal temperature for drying is around 68ºF/20ºC. If you do not have a dark spot in the house, you can try tying paper lunch bags over each bunch and piercing airholes in the bag. This has the added bonus of also keeping the dust off.

, Check them every now and then to see how they are drying - thicker stemmed herbs will take longer. Check to see if their consistency has become crumbly by rubbing a leaf between two fingers. If they crumble, they are ready to be taken down.

, Pick out any fluff, woody pieces and other foreign material as you remove the leaves. You can keep the leaves whole, crush them in your fingers to make a really fine ground mix for cooking (but use this quickly to retain flavour) or leave them in leaf shape for tea, garnishes on soups, etc. (these should not be too crumbly). Seeds should be left whole and crushed only when needed for cooking.

, Store the herbs for up to one year.

Freeze the herbs for ease of use when cooking.,
Select appropriate herbs for freezing.,
Wash and dry freshly picked herbs, as above.,
Some cooks prefer to freeze herbs in ice-cube trays, so that they have handy little sizes for cooking use.",How to Preserve Herbs3," Not all herbs will freeze well but for those that do, here is what to do.

, Usually this method works best for soft-leaf herbs such as basil, tarragon, lovage and parsley. Some herbs can only be frozen as they don't dry, such as chives.

, Strip the leaves off and place them into freezer bags or containers. Label and date them as they should keep for up to 3 months. If you want them to last longer, blanch them for a few seconds in hot water and then dip straight into ice-cold water and pop them into the freezer in bags/containers. Blanched herbs will freeze for up to 6 months.

, If you choose to do it this way, freeze approximately one-third chopped herbs to two-thirds water. Basil is great pureed with olive oil before freezing in ice cubes (don't add water). Remove herbs frozen as ice cubes and store in plastic freezer bags. Remove pieces as needed.

Keep in a cool or refrigerated place, especially during warmer months.",How to Preserve Herbs4," However, see the Warnings below first.

,, Olive oil is preferred but any other oils that you like are generally fine.

, If you want to use the oil as herbal flavoured oil, the stems are fine. Place in a bottle as a container; herbs remaining on their stem inside the oil bottle look very attractive as ornamental arrangements, as well as being useful culinary items. If you wish to remove the herbal leaves for cooking, a shorter, wider container is preferable to enable you to put in a spoon and scoop out the herbs and oil.

, Use within 6 months of preparation.

Pinch or snip off the stems from each basil leaf and discard them.,
Rinse the basil under cold, running water.,
Place 1- 2 handfuls of basil in your food processor.,
Use the “pulse” setting to chop the basil.,
Drizzle olive oil over the basil while you are chopping it.,
Spoon the chopped basil into freezer containers or ice cube trays.,
Use your frozen basil.",How to Freeze Basil1," You won't need the stems when you freeze the basil. If you harvest basil from your garden during the middle of the growing season, snip or pinch off the top 5 or 6” (12.7 to 15.2 cm) so that you leave some stems and leaves to keep on maturing.;
, You can also put the basil in a bowl of cold water and let it soak. Drain the water from the basil. Put the basil in a colander and let it drain thoroughly.


Gently pat the basil dry with paper towels. Basil is fragile, so pat the leaves gently or let them rest nestled between paper towels until they are dry.

, Fill up the food processor bowl, but don’t pack the leaves too tightly.

, This will result in coarsely chopped leaves; if you want to make a paste, use the manufacturer's suggested setting on your food processor. This should only take a few seconds. The more finely you want to chop the basil, the longer you should process it.

, Olive oil prevents the basil from turning dark or even black when it is frozen and gives it a richer flavor. You should use about 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil for each batch of basil. Using olive oil is optional. If you'd like to skip it but still freeze the basil in ice cube trays, you can add enough water to form a slush in the processor instead., If you use ice trays, you can transfer the basil cubes to larger containers after freezing them for 12 hours.

, You can leave them in the freezer for months and take them out and use them for recipes whenever you like, especially in the winter months. They'll separate from each other easily so you won't have to pull them apart. If you're putting them into a heated dish, then just throw in the frozen leaves and wait for them to thaw -- you won't have to thaw them on your own.


If you have too much frozen basil, give it away to your friends -- they'll love you for it.

Harvest the basil just before it flowers.,
Cut basil leaves from the stems.,
Rinse the leaves well.,
Pat the rinsed leaves dry.,

Use the crushed dried basil now in your recipes.

,
Remove the leaves from the stems after harvesting.,
Rinse the leaves and pat them dry.,
Prepare your oven or food dehydrator.,
Spread the leaves on trays in a thin layer.,
Dry the leaves to the correct moisture content.,
Store the dried leaves.",How to Dry Basil," Basil will flower after all the leaves on one stem are full-grown, but the herb loses some of its flavor after flowering occurs. The flowers appear in the middle of a bunch of leaves in a pyramid shape. Plan to prep and dry basil once all the leaves have sprouted, but before you see flowers on the stems.


Basil leaves have the most oil just before the plant flowers, so harvesting them at this point will ensure that the dried basil has as much flavor as possible.Harvest at mid-morning. This is the best time to harvest because the plant has been watered but the sun has dried the leaves.;
, Separate bunches of basil leaves and cut the individual leaves from the larger stem. Separating them will help you lay them flat and clean them properly. Leave a small length of stem, no more than an inch, at the bottom of each leaf to help you bundle them and tie them together.

, Rinse cut basil leaves under cold water before drying them. This will remove any dirt, chemicals or other debris that may have fallen onto the leaves while growing or while being shipped if your basil is store-bought.

, Lay the rinsed leaves on a paper towel and gently pat them dry with a second paper towel. Removing excess moisture before drying basil will prevent molding during the drying process.

, Group the prepped leaves in a bundle and tie them together at their stems with a rubber band or twist tie. Make more than one bundle if you have lots of basil leaves.

, Hang your bundles of basil from a hook or wall tack to dry. You don't have to hang them in your kitchen, but make sure you choose a place with freely circulating air and moderate sunlight to aid the drying process. Choose a room with a window that can be opened to let air and sunlight in and preferably one where bugs won't be able to get to your drying herbs.

, Your basil will be dried and ready to use in about two weeks or when the leaves are dark green, dry and brittle to the touch. If the leaves or stems still feel a little flexible, let them hang another week.


Remove the rubber band or twist tie, separate the dried basil bundle and crumble the dried leaves with your fingers. Store them in a labeled jar or container for future use.

,, If you want to dry the leaves more quickly, you can go ahead and remove the leaves from the stems. Discard the stems along with any leaves that are bruised or broken.

, Rinse them gently in water, then set them on paper towels and gently pat them dry.

, Basil leaves dry beautifully in either an oven set to very low heat or a food dehydrator.


If you're using the oven, set it to the lowest temperature - 200 °F (93 °C) or lower.If you're using a food dehydrator, ready it for operation according to the manufacturer's instructions.

, Either spread them on a baking tray or the food dehydrator tray. Make sure none of the leaves overlap. They should be arranged in one thin, even layer.

, The leaves should be dried over the course of 24-48 hours until they are no longer moist; they should crumble easily when pinched between your fingers.


If you're using the oven, place the tray of leaves inside the preheated oven and let them bake for 20 minutes. Turn off the oven and leave the leaves inside overnight. In the morning, they should be sufficiently dry.If you're using the food dehydrator, place the tray of leaves inside and operate the food dehydrator for 24-48 hours.

, You can store them whole in plastic food storage bags or bins, or crush them and store them in spice bottles.

Understand the process.,
Gather salt water.,
Strain the water.,
Evaporate the water.,
Harvest the salt that's left behind.",How to Make Sea Salt1," Commercial salt makers produce sea salt in much larger scale than a home salt maker would, but knowing the commercial techniques can increase your knowledge and salt making possibilities. Here's how they do it:


Small ponds are filled with sea water and the water is left to evaporate. The product left behind after all the water is gone is sea salt. This process works best in areas where there is a lot of sun and very little rain.
Salt water is piped into large steel pans. Any mud or impurities settle to the bottom and the remaining good water is siphoned off and heated. As the water heats, any foam that forms is skimmed off the top and the water continues to evaporate until only salt crystals remain.
Additives are sometimes included. Commercial seas salt makers sometimes add calcium and magnesium to their salts to provide added nutrition and a distinct taste.;
, Water rich in salt is gathered from salt-rich seas or salt ponds. Depending on where the water is gathered from, the resulting salt will take on varying shades of color due to the variety of minerals present in each respective location. Collecting some water from the ocean may not provide the quality salt you are hoping for, especially for cooking purposes, because of the low salinity of the water, but it's worth experimenting with water from a variety of sources to find out what produces the best salt.


It's essential to gather salt water from a clean source. If you know an area to be polluted, do not gather water from there. Air pollution, oil and chemical runoff, and other types of pollution will affect the taste and quality of the salt.
If an area is safe for fishing, it's probably safe to assume the water is clean enough for salt harvesting, too.
A gallon-sized glass or plastic jug is a good size for gathering water. One gallon of water will yield about 3 ounces of salt.

, It's necessary to remove sand, shells and other sediments from the water before you harvest the salt. Use cheesecloth to strain your salt water. One or several layers can be used. To be extra sure impurities are removed, strain the water several times. It won't affect the salt content.

, Sea salt is the product that remains from evaporating the salt water. Plan ahead for the evaporation to take at least a few days, and often several weeks. For home sea salt making, one of several techniques can be employed.


Turn your oven to its lowest setting. Pour the water into a high-sided container and place it in the oven. Let the water slowly evaporate over the course of several days.Put your strained salt into a pot and boil until almost all the water is gone. Let the sun do the rest. Remove the damp salt from the pot and place it on a plate or in a bowl. Sit it in the sun to finish evaporating all the water.
Place your strained water in a bowl or shallow dish and allow it to sit out in the open so the water evaporates. What is left behind when all the water is gone is the sea salt. This method could take several weeks.

, You'll see a crust start to form when the water evaporates. Use a spoon to scrape it into a container. Salt crystals will form in a range of shapes and sizes, and may take on different colors depending on where you collected your water.


You may choose to grind it to a finer texture. You can use a salt grinder for this purpose.
Enjoy the salt by tasting it plain or using it in your everyday cooking.

Wait for the crystals to grow.,
Use the crystals.",How to Make Rock Salt1," You need enough water to fill your jar. How much water you use will depend on how large your jar is.;
, Keep the water boiling at this point. You can use any type of salt, such as: iodized salt, uniodized salt, sea salt or Epsom salt.If you plan on eating the salt crystals, do not use Epsom salt.


Uniodized salt will give you the best-shaped crystals.

, If you want to make colored rock salt, add a few drops of food coloring. The more food coloring you add, the darker your crystals will become., Be careful not to get any of those extra salt grains into your jar.Some people find that placing a spoon into the jar first helps keep the jar from cracking., The string should be long enough to fit inside your jar, but not so long that it touches the bottom. About 1/2 to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) from the bottom of the jar will be plenty.

, The string should be suspended in the water. If string won't stay down, tie a bead or paper clip to it.Again, the bottom of the string should not be touching the bottom of jar. If it is, cut the string shorter.

, If you can, try to keep the jar covered, such as with a box. You want the water to be able to evaporate, but you don't want any dust to get inside the jar, which can prevent the crystals from forming.The room temperature should also remain consistent.

, As the water evaporates, it will leave the salt behind. During this time, the salt will begin to come together and form crystals. Most of the crystals will grow on the strong, but you may also get some growing on the walls of the jar.


It will take a few days for the crystals to grow. The longer you wait, the larger they will become. If you want really large crystals, you will need to use a crystal seed. Click here to learn how to grow and use a crystal seed.

, Once the crystals get to the size you want, carefully pull the string out and pour the water out of the jar. If you want to use these crystals to eat, carefully break them off the string. You can also use a butter knife to pry them away from the walls of the jar.

, Arrange the blanched parsley across the tray. Try to keep it flat and evenly spaced, with no big clumps of parsley sticking together.

, Turn the oven on to the lowest possible setting. The best time to do this method is after the oven has been turned off, following other baking. Otherwise, always err on the side of taking longer than having it too warm and burning the parsley.

, The exact time will vary based on the relative humidity in your area and the altitude. Keep an eye on it, because it might dry more quickly. It's ready when it crumbles easily in your fingers.

, Crush the parsley with your hands or in a mortar and pestle. Remove any remaining stalks.

, Store in a dry, dark place, or even the freezer. Parsley dried this way can be good for long periods of time, but will start to lose its flavor after several months.

The salt and citrus combine to create a seasoning you can use for every meal of the day. This bright, refreshing salt is perfect sprinkled on fresh vegetables, salads, and fish:


Mix 1/2 cup sea salt, 1/2 cup lemon juice and the zest of 1 lemon in a bowl.
Spread the mixture on a rimmed baking sheet.
Bake it in the oven turned on its lowest setting until the moisture has evaporated - several hours or overnight.
Scrape the lemon salt into a container.

, When salty and sweet flavors are combined, the taste is pretty irresistible.In this case sea salt is combined with a bourbon and sugar syrup to create a rich, deep-tasting salt that you can sprinkle on baked goods for a wonderful treat.


Simmer 1 cup of bourbon in a saucepan over medium heat until it's reduced to about 1/4 cup.
Combine the bourbon reduction, 1/2 cup sea salt and 1/2 cup sugar in a food processor, pulsing until it becomes sandy in texture.
Spread the mixture on a rimmed baking sheet.
Bake it in the oven turned on its lowest setting until the moisture has evaporated - several hours or overnight.

, Next time you fire up your smoker to smoke a piece of meat, put a tray of sea salt in there, too. Line a tray or a piece of sturdy aluminum foil with 1/2 cup or more of sea salt. Allow it to smoke in the smoker for several hours, then pour it into a container. Enjoy the rich, fragrant taste of smoky sea salt on baked potatoes, pizza and other savory dishes.

, Keep adding salt until no more will dissolve, and you see a few grains of salt at the bottom of the pot.

, Once no more salt will dissolve, take the saucepan off the stove, and pour the water into a small dish. You are only using a little bit of water for now, so that it can evaporate faster. You will likely have a lot of water left over. Either save this water for later, or pour it out.


Be very careful not to get any salt grains into the dish. If you get any salt grains, your salt crystals won't be very big., Put the dish someplace where it won't be disturbed. It will take a few hours to a day for the water to evaporate and tiny crystals to form.

, The crystal should be well-shaped, and not have any smaller crystals attached to it.This is known as a ""seed crystal."" The rest of the salt crystals will cling to this, and create a perfect, cubic crystal., Tie the other end of the thread to a pencil. You can also use a popsicle stick or chopstick instead.

, Boil some more water, and add some salt to it. Keep adding salt until no more will dissolve, and you see a few grains at the bottom of the pot. Take the pot off the stove and let the water cool.

, Don't let it splash into the water, if you may trigger the growth of smaller crystals.The water must be cool, or the crystal may dissolve.

, If you can, try to keep the jar covered, such as with a box. You want the water to be able to evaporate, but you don't want any dust to get into the jar. The temperature in the room must also be consistent., As the water evaporates, the salt will stay behind, and collect on your seed crystal. The longer you wait, the larger your crystal will become. Once it reaches the size you want, pull the crystal out of the water, and cut the string off. Pour the salt water out. You should now have an extra-large salt rock.

Pick the parsley in the morning.,
Gather the parsley in bundles.,
Secure the bundles with twine or rubber bands.,
Place the bundles in brown paper bags.,
Remove the bundles after two weeks.,
Store the parsley in an airtight container.",How to Dry Parsley2," If you're going to air dry parsley, you want to make sure you gather it at its most tender point, which is early in the morning, but enough after sun-up to have burned off the dew from the night before.


Don't worry about washing the parsley if you've picked it. It should be as dry as possible to start out with.

, Keep them fairly loose so that air can circulate around the leaves as they dry. You can make bundles as big as your hand or you can keep the bundles smaller if you wish. Just make sure they're not too tight when you tie them.

, Rubber bands are easiest if you have bigger bundles. Secure the stems of the parsley, letting the larger, leafier portion fan out while it dries.

, Storing the drying bundles in bags will keep them dust free and won't allow sunlight to bleach the color from the parsley. Cut some holes in the bags to allow air to circulate, and keep the bundles nice and dry.


Store the bags in a cool, dry place with good air circulation. Stacking them on a drying rack, or an old clothes rack can be a good method of storing them.Alternatively, you can leave them out of the bags and tie them with string to hang in your kitchen and dry. Hang the bundles upside down for a more decorative, but equally effective, method of drying.

, The parsley is dried when it becomes easily crumbled in your fingers. Spread the bundles on the counter on a piece of wax paper or a cutting board, and crumble the bunches, taking care to remove the woody stems.

, Save old herb containers to reuse for your dried parsley, keep them in mason jars, or other containers. Store in a cool dry place in your kitchen.

Consider using a food dehydrator.,
Use the power of the sun.,
Use the microwave.,
Finished.

",How to Dry Parsley3," While they can be pricey, dehydrators can offer lower heat and more drying control than the oven. If you want to be able to dry parsley quickly, this can be an effective method.


Usually, food dehydrators will have an herb setting. Clean the parsley as you would to dry it in the oven, spread the parsley on the drying trays, and follow the instructions on your dehydrator.

, All you need to dehydrate parsley is a good hot day without much cloud cover and a baking sheet. You need to make sure that it isn't too humid, or the parsley won't dry properly.


Old window screens can make excellent drying racks to separate the parsley from the cookie sheet or baking tray. Cut the old screens to fit the size of the tray, and place the parsley on top to keep air flowing evenly around the parsley as it dries in the sun.Over the course of the day, turn the parsley over so it gets evenly tanned on both sides. Depending on where you live and the amount of sun available, it may take a few days or be perfectly dry by lunchtime. Keep an eye on it and make sure to bring it in when it gets dark, to avoid dew.

, You can dry parsley in the microwave, but you can also burn it very quickly, and its difficult to get the parsley dried evenly (as with most microwaved things). If you want to use the microwave, spread your cleaned parsley out on a paper plate in a single layer and nuke it for a minute or two at a time. Keep close watch. If it starts getting dark, or smoking, take it out.

Be prepared.,
No matter what happens, be proud that you made it to college!",How to Find the Perfect College," You should be thinking about what colleges you want to enroll in as early as sophomore year in high school. By this time, its important to think about what you would like to major in. Choosing a major is another hard decision, but think about things that you like to do. Do you love math? Perhaps you can major in accounting. Are you great at finding the scoop on almost anything? Journalism can be an awesome major for you. Discover what you love and see how you can apply it in a college major.


By Junior year you should have an idea on what major you will be studying.;
, If you can write down the perfect college, what characteristics would it have? Programs, student to faculty ratio etc.

, This will help you narrow your school choices by tuition, and help your parents figure out a budget.

, Are you planning to stay in-state or go to school out-of-state? This decision can also affect tuition, pricing, and financial aid.

, Once you have gathered this information, you are now ready to research schools. Don't be afraid to research HUNDREDS of schools as there are many opportunities out there.

,


According to the Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA, the top qualities college freshmen seek in a school include:

Academic reputation
Availability of financial aid
Job placement success
College size



, If you are a small town girl/boy that graduated with less than 500 seniors, a large university may not be the choice for you as this can create stress and you may feel like you don't fit in.

, If you're not the best at taking tests or your scores weren't terrific, there are many schools that are more lenient

, He to she will be able to get you information on tour dates, deadlines etc.

, Most schools have campus tours where you can see classroom size, the population, dorm rooms etc. This can give a bigger picture on what life would be like if you attended this school.

, Make sure to apply to a handful of schools as unfortunately you may get rejected from one.

, You may not get into every school you apply to. Many people also don't get into the school of their first choice. Make sure to have a plan B...and C.

, Prepare to meet new people, make new friends and take the first step into your future. Congratulations!

Choose table salt or sea salt to season cooked food.,
Utilize sea salt and kosher salt in your cooking.,
Use table salt to salt water and create brines.,
Use coarse, unrefined salt for fermenting vegetables.",How to Choose the Right Salt1," Traditional table salt is the most common salt to use to season food at the dining room table. The small, quickly dissolving crystals make it perfect to sprinkle on food before you eat. Sea salt, on the other hand, will change the texture of the meal and add more salty-bursts to each bite of your food. Both salts are popular for seasoning cooked food.Table salt also usually contains non-caking agents and iodine.;
, Sea salt and kosher salt are superior salts to use in cooking because the large grains makes it easy to visually regulate the amount of salt that you're adding to a dish. Also, these salts have no additives and are coarsely ground, which creates more intensely flavored food.Sea salt and kosher salt are great for seasoning raw proteins.

, The fine crystals of table salt make it the best type of salt to use when salting water for pasta or creating a pork or beef brine. This is because the smaller crystals dissolve into the water faster., Coarse, unrefined salts like sea salts and Himalayan rock salt are the best for fermenting vegetables. Do not use salts that contain anti-caking agents or iodine because it can inhibit the beneficial bacteria in a fermented vegetable."

Seal and store your salt.",How to Make Flavored Salt1," When making infused salts, you’ll have the most success using larger grains that aren’t overpowered by the other flavors you’re incorporating. Sea salt, kosher salt or Maldon salt flakes are ideal, but you can also use normal table salt if it’s all that’s available. Begin by making about one cup of flavored salt at a time.Kosher salt is a safe choice, as it’s the least costly and has just the right texture for making flavored infusions.
If you’re using fine-grained table salt, increase the amount of dry flavoring ingredients by a teaspoon or two to keep the proportions correct.;
, Salt meshes well with a tremendous variety of herbs and spices. Some of the more common types of flavored salts include garlic, onion, celery and ginger, but you could also use cayenne pepper, citrus zest, radish, coriander, rose petals or even brown sugar or coffee beans. Almost any natural ingredient imaginable can be dried and infused into salt.You have the option of using fresh-picked herbs, if you prefer. Just throw them in the oven for a couple hours, then grind them to a fine consistency before mixing them into the salt.Dust fresh-baked brownies with cinnamon-espresso salt, or throw a pinch of rosemary-mint onto a rack of lamb.

, The easiest way to do this is to pulse the salt and flavorings together in a food processor or coffee grinder, but you could also use a mortar and pestle or simply blend them by hand. Use about 1 teaspoon of your chosen flavor per ¼ cup of salt. Mix the ingredients until the particles of the dry flavorings are evenly distributed throughout the salt.To ensure proper distribution, your salt and other dry ingredients should be approximately the same size. Crush or grind larger herbs and spices if necessary to help them blend better.
Making flavored salt using dry ingredients can be done in a single container in as a little as a couple minutes.

, Transfer the flavored salt to an airtight container and stash it away in the cupboard or refrigerator. It’s that easy! Flavored salts made with dry ingredients will last for months or even years, since there’s no chance of moisture seeping into the salt and causing it to get sticky.Salt is a natural preservative, which means you won’t have to worry about the added ingredients going bad.A shaker of garlic, chili powder and red pepper salt makes a great all-purpose seasoning to keep on the table 24/7.
Keep a few different salts on hand for when it’s time to take your homemade delicacies to the next level.

Look for “no salt added” canned vegetables.,
Buy sodium-free sauces.,
Choose dry beans.,
Buy whole grains.,
Use caution with condiments.",How to Cut Salt from Pantry Foods1," Canned vegetables are generally high in sodium. To cut the salt from these, buy canned vegetables that say “no salt added” on the label. That ensures you are getting the vegetable without added salt.If you want a little bit of salt to taste, you can add a small amount of salt when you put the food on the plate.
Consider cooking your vegetables with spices and herbs to eliminate the need for added salt. For example, try adding rosemary and thyme to green beans or ginger and sage to carrots.;
, Many sauces, such as pasta sauces, have a lot of added sodium. Most brands offer a sodium free option. If you can’t find sodium free, you may find a reduced sodium option.Make sure to check the serving size. Reduced sodium varieties may not be low in sodium if the serving size is smaller than what you would eat.

, Canned beans are full of unnecessary salt. However, beans are a really healthy food. To get away from this, try dried beans. This will give you the benefits without added sodium.Dried beans take longer to cook, so cook enough for multiple servings for the week.

, Many grain items may be full of sodium and other unhealthy additives, especially if you buy flavored varieties. Replace these sodium-heavy versions with plain, whole grains that are relatively salt free.For example, instant oatmeal not only contains added sodium, but sugar as well. Plain, steel cut oats are a healthier option.
When buying cereal, look for brands that have whole grains as the first ingredient. Make sure to buy a brand with a low sodium content.
Try whole grain pasta, brown rice, quinoa, buckwheat, and bulgur.

, Condiments are pantry staples, but they can be loaded with salt. Read the labels carefully and compare brands and types before buying. If available, get a reduced sodium, low-sodium, or no-sodium added variety.Condiments may include ketchup, mustard, dressing, olives, pickles, relish, dips, and soy sauce.
Consider leaving the condiments off your food completely.

Use finishing salts to elevate the taste of a dish.,
Choose flaky salts to modify the texture.,
Finish dishes with coarse salt to add salty bursts of flavor.",How to Choose the Right Salt2," Finishing salts are often more expensive than the other varieties and are typically harvested by hand. These salts can range from crunchy or soft, colorful or dull and can be stronger tasting than other salts. Choose this salt if you want to make your dish extra special.Examples of finishing salts include infused sea salts, sel gris, and fleur de sel.

, Certain finishing salts like Fleur de Sel are expensive and add a unique texture to your dishes. The thin flakes of the salt add a burst of flavor with a light and crunchy texture that lasts for a long time on your tongue. Flake salts are similar in texture but contain less moisture, so that the salty taste doesn't linger on the taste buds.One of the most popular brands of flaked sea salt is Maldon., Adding sea salt or another coarse salt to dishes will add a crunch to the food and will also add more intense bursts of salty flavor within the food. While traditional processed table salt usually dissolves on food, sea salt will often stay intact, which is what gives it a different taste.


Experiment with finishing your food with different salt to see what tastes best to you.

Consider the health benefits of iodized salt.,
Determine how much you want to spend.,
Select pink, red, or black salt to add a burst of color.,
Consider other specialty salts.",How to Choose the Right Salt3," Iodine helps promote a healthy thyroid gland and is a typical addition to table salt. Check the packaging to see if the salt that you buy contains iodine. Often, sea salt, finishing salt, and kosher salts do not contain iodine but do contain other trace minerals like magnesium and potassium. Other than thyroid benefits, most salt has the same nutritional value.
If you have an iodine deficiency, you should use iodized salt to help regulate your thyroid.

, Certain salts are much more expensive than others. Traditional table salts are typically the least expensive, while sea salts and kosher salt cost a little more. The most costly salts include specialized salts and finishing salts. Consider your budget and choose a salt that fits in it., Red and black Hawaiian sea salt can add a splash of red or black to any dish. This is especially pleasing on sweets such as chocolate. Himalayan salt, on the other hand, is a coarse pink salt that can be sprinkled on a finished dish and tastes similar to sea salt., Other than the traditional salts that you can get at the grocery store, there are also a variety of different salts that can be purchased at specialty stores or online. Lavender sea salt, for example, is coarse like sea salt but has a sweet aromatic flavor that plays differently with different foods.There are also salts like sesame salt and pink Japanese rock salt that have their own unique taste and applications in Asian dishes."

Choose a wet condiment to add to your salt.,
Mix the salt and condiments together.,
Allow the mixture to dry.,
Separate and pack the salt.",How to Make Flavored Salt2," Any thick cream or oil-based condiment, sauce or dressing can serve as a base for an infusion. You could use ketchup, Dijon mustard, Sriracha or French dressing, or more outside-the-box flavors like shrimp sauce or chimichurri. Get creative and have fun seeing what unusual flavor combinations you can come up with.As a rule, the condiment you use should be thick enough to spread. Thin, watery flavorings may just dissolve the salt.
Season burger patties with barbecue salt, or whip up some spicy buffalo salt to sprinkle on a bowl of popcorn before you sit down to watch a movie.

, Using either a food processor or a mixing bowl and spatula, whisk ½ cup of salt with 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of whatever flavoring you’ve chosen. Make sure the salt and condiments are thoroughly blended. The salt will begin to change color and form a gritty paste once the wet ingredients have been properly incorporated.Feel free to use more or less of a given flavoring depending on how intense you want it to be.
If you’re unsure how much is enough, add the wet condiment a little bit at a time to avoid oversaturating the salt.

, Scrape the salt paste onto a nonstick baking sheet or piece of wax paper. If left to air dry, it will need to sit for up to 48 hours before it sets up completely. You also have the option of heating the mixture in the oven at a low temperature until it is dry throughout.To dry the salt in the oven, set the temperature low (around 150-170 degrees F) and let it warm slowly and gradually. The heat will evaporate excess moisture out of the mixture.Stir up the salt every half hour or so to keep it from clumping as it dries.

, After the salt has had ample time to dry, use the back of a spoon or some other hard, blunt surface to break up any remaining clumps into loose granules. Funnel the salt into a mason jar, bottle or shaker and find a home for it on your spice rack. Pull it out when you want to add a dash to dinner or a midday snack. You’re done!Throw the dried salt back into the food processor or coffee grinder for a few seconds to grind it down to a consistent size.
Salts made with wet ingredients should be stored in airtight containers to keep moisture from getting in."

Select a flavored liquid for your salt.,
Bring the liquid to a boil.,
Heat the liquid until it forms a reduction.,
Add the salt and dry the mixture.",How to Make Flavored Salt3," Certain liquids can be cooked down to then be combined with salt like wet condiments. Wines and heavy liquors are especially good for this purpose due to their sugar content and high smoke point. Grab a bottle of your favorite pinot noir or barrel-aged whiskey and get cooking.Browse a few recipes to see which liquids can be used to make reductions and which can’t.
Try a dash of maple-bourbon salt on a sirloin steak or homemade caramels.

, Pour 2-3 cups of your chosen liquid into a saucepan. Turn on the stove top to a medium-high temperature and heat the liquid until it just begins to bubble. From there, reduce the heat and let it continue simmering.The liquid will most likely need to simmer for between 15-20 minutes, but exact times may vary. Keep an eye on it as it cooks down.

, The process of boiling and simmering the liquid will cook the moisture out of it, causing it to thicken into a condensed syrup. Stir the reduction continuously to keep air moving through it and prevent it from burning or sticking to the saucepan. When it’s thick enough to coat the outside of your spoon or ladle, it’s ready to be added to the salt.You should be left with 1–2 tablespoons (14.8–29.6 ml) of syrup after the liquid is fully reduced.Remove the reduction from the heat as soon as it’s finished. It can burn very easily if it continues being exposed to heat after it has thickened.

, Drain the contents of the saucepan onto a nonstick baking sheet. Pour in 1-1 ½ cups of salt and fold the salt into the syrup by hand. Spread the salt mixture thin and place the baking sheet in the oven for about 2 hours at 170 °F (76.7 °C). The dried salt can then be broken up and sifted into a different container. That’s all it takes!Shake or stir the salt periodically to keep it separated.
You can produce roughly 1 cup of salt per batch this way.

Choose plain popcorn.,
Buy plain unsalted nuts.,
Avoid chips.",How to Cut Salt from Pantry Foods2," Popcorn can be a healthy snack, but many prepackaged versions contain large amounts of added salt. Instead of movie theater butter or salted popcorn, choice plain microwavable bags. You can buy the plain kernels and pop them in an air popper for even fresher popcorn.If you want to add some flavor, consider sprinkling cinnamon over it for something sweet or adding a dash of garlic or seasoning salt.

, Nuts are a delicious, healthy snack and a common pantry item. However, many nuts are covered in salt. Replace your salted peanuts, almonds, and mixed nuts with unsalted varieties. You still get delicious flavor without all the unnecessary salt., Chips contain high levels of sodium. To cut salt from your pantry, find an alternative to potato and corn chips. Try finding a low-sodium cracker or try cucumbers and carrots for a crunchy snack instead. Look for a chip or cracker that contains less than 200 mg of sodium per serving.Some brands carry reduced sodium or no salt added chips. Read the label and decide if the sodium content is low enough to be a healthy swap.
If you are basing the sodium content on the serving size, make sure to eat one serving. Measure it out. It is easy to go over the serving size and eat too much sodium.

"
"
Read the labels.,
Get rid of processed foods in your pantry.,
Be careful with low fat foods.,
Switch from pantry items to fresh items.",How to Cut Salt from Pantry Foods3," If you are trying to cut salt from your foods, you should read the labels. Reading the ingredients and the sodium content can help you make smarter choices. Sometimes, different brands have higher sodium content, so you can choose a brand with lower sodium per serving.When choosing foods, go for foods that have low sodium contents. Avoid foods that contain high levels.
Shoot for less than 200 mg or lower per serving if possible., Sodium is found in high amounts in most processed foods. Many people fill their pantries with processed food, so if you’re trying to cut the salt, consider getting rid of the processed food in your pantry. If you still want to use processed food, check the sodium content to choose lower sodium options.Processed food that contains added sodium includes chips, canned soups, bread, broth and stock, snack cakes, cookies, pastries, cereals, and juice.

, Many reduced fat or fat free foods are full of sodium. This happens because adding sodium helps add flavor to a low fat food. Read the ingredients and check the sodium content to make sure you’re not accidentally getting a salt-heavy food., Pantry items are generally processed because they are meant to last for longer periods of time. Though you can get reduced sodium versions of many foods, they may still contain sodium. Consider buying fresh, whole foods instead of boxed, processed foods.For example, buy fresh vegetables instead of canned, or try no sodium added frozen ones.
Make your own cakes, cookies, and other desserts from scratch. You can leave out the added salt when you bake them yourself.
Make your own sauces. For example, pasta sauce can have a high salt content, but if you make your own from fresh tomatoes, you can eliminate the salt.

Sit university entrance exams.,
Apply to universities through UCAS.,
Apply to five universities–– it’s a good idea to apply to a variety.,
Sort out student finance.,
Once you have the grades to get into university and your student finance sorted, you are good to go.,
Enrol and study for your degree!,
Get work experience in the summer.",How to Get a Bachelor's Degree in Psychology (UK)," These can include A levels or Scottish Highers. Some universities allow BTEC courses. Students typically work towards their university entrance exams between the ages of 16- 18 years old at a sixth form school or college after they have completed their GCSE’s. But there are options for adults to sit entrance exams externally with a tutor or distance learning courses such as ICS and they can even apply for a maintenance loan via Student Finance. Most universities require you to have a minimum of 240 UCAS points. However, some higher- tier universities may specify higher grades (e.g. AAB in your A levels) and exclude some form of exams which other universities may accept. Course information for specific universities can be found through a simple google search for the university. Calculating what grades you need to get into certain universities can be calculated in the UCAS calculator linked below. Subjects you may want to consider studying which would later be relevant to a Psychology degree include Statistics, Biology, Chemistry, English Language and of course Psychology. However, it is not compulsory that you study these subjects. It is probably more important that you study subjects that you enjoy because this will mean you will be motivated to work harder and therefore achieve higher grades.;
, It’s very important when looking at BSc Psychology degrees that you picked one that is approved by the British Psychological Society (BPS). They usually have the course code C800 and they have defined modules that Psychology undergraduates need to be taught in case they want to become a Charted Psychologist after they graduate. Students who graduate with a Psychology degree that is not approved have to do a one year conversion course if they want to go onto post- graduate training.

, If you want to go to a university that requires you to have high grades, it would be wise to also apply to universities with lower grade requirements in case you don’t get the grades you were expecting. Later in the application process, UCAS will ask you to narrow your choices from five universities to two. These are called a “firm choice” and an “insurance choice.” Typically a student will make their desired university their firm choice and another university that they would not mind going to their insurance choice. Universities will let you know if you have been accepted onto their course the day you get your results from your sixth form exams.

, It costs £9000 tuition per annum to attend university and unless you can pay for it straight out of your pocket, you need to get this organised. You may also need a maintenance loan to cover living costs. Although the idea of a loan might be scary, it is not your typical bank loan where you have to pay back interest. You only pay back amounts once you’re on £21,000 a year. In fact, most people will never pay off their student loan. It is a payment based on financial success in later life. There is a link to student finance below.

, The university you are accepted into will usually ask if you want to apply for a place in halls. If this is what you want, apply as soon as possible. However, a lot of first year student choose to live in their parental home or in shared housing with other students.

, BSc psychology degree in the UK are usually three years long unless there is a foundation year for people who did not quite get the grades to get straight onto their degree or if there is a placement year in the middle of the course. So, first year does not count towards you’re final degree classification at all, second year will count for 30% towards your final classification and your third year will count towards 70% of your final degree classification. Most people have a lot of fun in first year but remember to at least pass your exam with 40%: you need this in order to enrol onto second year! Also, no matter how tempting it is to stay in bed, attend all of your lectures.

, You get three glorious months off in the summer. But it is a good idea to get an experience of a job. Although any kind of experience is good, work experience in a hospital is very valuable for a psychology undergraduate.

Contribute something new.,
Meet all length and content requirements.,
Adhere to all copyright laws.,
Request IRB approval.,
Follow an approved style guide.",How to Follow Dissertation Regulations1," The baseline for a successful dissertation project is whether or not it contributes something new to the field. Generally speaking, a master’s thesis should indicate mastery over the subject matter; a doctoral dissertation should do this, as well as cover new ground. Begin by trying to display your mastery of a given subject area, and see what new discoveries you can contribute.Scan the literature in your field (and related fields) to determine whether your ideas are truly new.
Run your ideas past your advisor to get feedback. He or she should be able to tell you if your concepts are novel enough, or if you need to push further.;
, Depending on your field, your university, and your department, there may be certain requirements you need to meet. These might include a minimum length, and/or a certain number of chapters. You may also be required to format your chapters in a specific way (e.g., Introduction, Literature Review, Methodology, Findings, and Conclusion). Speak to your advisor to determine what requirements you must meet., In order for your dissertation to pass, it must be completely original material. This means that any time you quote someone directly, the text must appear in quotes with a proper citation. Likewise, whenever you paraphrase or use the concept of someone else, you also need to provide citation. It is a good idea to review the plagiarism guidelines at your school, as well as the copyright laws in your state., If you will be using human subjects in your work, you will need to apply to the Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Subjects. To gain approval, you must submit an application that details the specifics of your study. Submit these materials at least one month (through the IRB website) before you begin your use of human subjects., Depending on both your field of study and the unique preferences of your university, a certain style guide will be preferred over others. Popular style guides include MLA, APA, and Chicago styles, although there are many others. These dictate specific grammar and punctuation rules that you will need to follow.

Research the specific formatting guidelines for your dissertation.,
Follow the formatting guidelines.,
Meet with a dissertation reviewer.",How to Follow Dissertation Regulations2," Your university will have created very specific (and unbreakable) guidelines for formatting your dissertation. This will include specifics about margin size, font size, acceptable font, the way figures or images are titled, numbering and pagination, order of front matter (approval page, table of contents, acknowledgements, etc.), and other specifics. You must first determine all of these specific requirements. Search on your university’s website or speak to your dissertation advisor to obtain this information., Once you are aware of the specific guidelines for formatting your manuscript, begin moving down them one by one. It is a really good idea to familiarize yourself with these requirements before you even begin writing, and to start your document with the right dimensions, font, etc. from the beginning. If you have not done this, that’s OK. Simply move down your list of formatting rules and make changes where you need to., Most schools will have individuals who work as “thesis or dissertation reviewers.” You can make an appointment with one of these people and they will sit down with you to make sure that your dissertation is formatted in the proper way. Some of the guidelines can be confusing (especially in regard to pagination), so it is a great idea to seek out this resource and take advantage of it at your school.Be sure to bring in a formatted version of your dissertation!

Determine when you hope to graduate.,
Find out your submission deadline and work backwards.,
Create a timetable.,
Make a schedule.,
Celebrate milestones.,
Finish writing the semester prior.",How to Follow Dissertation Regulations3," Once you have completed your course work, passed any preliminary exams, and defended a dissertation proposal, it is time to determine when you will try to graduate. Only you know how quickly you can write, or how well defined your idea is. If you must do interviews, fieldwork, or lab work in order to write, this process will take longer for you. Create a realistic writing schedule for yourself, and use this to determine when you will be able to complete your doctoral work., There are a number of deadlines that you will need to meet in order to satisfy the requirements of your dissertation. First, find out when you will need to have the approved document submitted to your university. This is usually almost a month prior to graduation. Once you know this date, you can work backwards to create other milestones and due dates.Let’s say you must have your document submitted by April 12 (for a May graduation).
Your defense can be no later than April 5. (You will need at least a week for final edits and last minute formatting.)
You must have your dissertation submitted to your committee by March 5. (They need four weeks to read it.)
You will need at least two weeks for final revisions, and your advisor will need at least three weeks to do a final read-through. So you need your finished draft to your advisor no later than January 30.

, Once you have determined when you think you can graduate and thus, when you must have a finished draft, continue to work backwards to create a more specific timetable. This is a process best done with the help of your advisor.


You may consider giving yourself four weeks of writing time per chapter. If you will have 5 chapters, this means you will need 20 weeks to write. You will also need additional time for reading and research.
Set down due dates for each chapter.
Remember to account for the time it will take for your advisor to return your pages and for you to complete revisions on each chapter.
Also, remember to continue writing while your advisor has your pages. Do not wait for revisions to resume your work.

, Now that you have a timetable, you will need to make a more specific schedule. A good rule is to try to produce 2-pages of solid writing per day and/or to write in 3-4 hour chunks. If possible, it is also a good idea to write at the same time each day.


Pencil in writing times for yourself into your schedule.
You will need to protect this time for yourself. Do not use this time to schedule meetings, prep your classes, or do other errands or work.

, Writing a dissertation is a very long process. Because of this, many people become disheartened at times. You can keep the dissertations blues away by celebrating each milestone. Every time you turn in a chapter, take a day off to celebrate. Every time your advisor approves a chapter (meaning it no longer needs any revisions), treat yourself to something nice.

, A good rule of thumb is to have a full, finished draft of your complete dissertation one full semester prior to your intended graduation date. For example, if you plan to walk across the stage in May, you should have a complete draft by the end of the fall semester (usually mid-December)."

Before you commit to a test, check with your school to find out what the entrance requirements are. In addition, they should be able to tell you what score you need to make to get in.Look on the school's website or contact the admissions office to find out more.;
, Most schools will allow you to use the national standardized tests for getting into community college. The two main tests are the SAT and the ACT. The SAT focuses more on math, writing, and reading, while the ACT has a science section, as well.These tests cost money, and you must schedule them well in advance. Most communities only offer them on certain dates, usually on Saturdays.
You can visit the websites for each test to find places in your community to take them or ask at your local high school. You can also register for the test online.You should prepare ahead of time for these tests by reviewing practice tests and materials. The websites for the test have practice tests you can take., Some community colleges require placement tests in place of the national college tests, though most schools will take either one. You will likely need to take the test at the school. Each school's test will be a little different, but likely it will test you in math, reading comprehension, writing, and science.Some schools will even allow you to take one from home.Usually, the school's placement test will be a little cheaper than the national test. However, if you plan to move on to a four-year college, you might as well take the national test, as you will need it then.

, Some schools allow other tests to be substituted for the standard placement tests. For instance, sometimes Advanced Placement (AP) scores can be substituted, which are scores on tests for college-level classes you took in high school.Other possible substitutes include the IBT and the IELTS, both of which are English exams.You may also be admitted if you already have a college degree or you've passed an English class at another school, though it must be college-level., Most schools have online applications now. Find your school's website, and locate the admissions page. You should be able to quickly find the online application.You likely can still apply with a paper application if you prefer.

You may also need to take dual education courses or even finish high school.For an associate's degree, you'll need to select credit courses.
Noncredit courses are often just offered for fun or to learn a new skill, while continuing educations are meant for professionals who are required to have a certain number of hours per year for their jobs. Dual education is when you take a class at a community college while you are still in high school and earn credit in both places., When you enter, you need to tell the school what you want to study, also known as a major. Most community colleges have degrees in things like business, accounting, or nursing.Your school will have a list of majors you can pursue while you are there.
You can change your course of study, but at a community college, it can take you much longer to finish if you change in the middle.

, You'll need information like your state of residence, your address, your parents' names, and your Social Security number. You'll also need information on factors such as your citizenship and ethnicity., This area will include your testing scores and your transcripts and information from other schools. You'll need to know things like your high school grade point average (GPA). They may also have questions about any CLEP or AP tests you've taken that give you college credit, as well as any credits you'll want to transfer from other schools., You will need to back up much of what you've reported in your application. For instance, you'll need high school transcripts and transcripts from any other colleges you've gone to. You'll also need to designate the community colleges you've chosen as a place to send test scores when you take the test, or you need to have them sent afterwards. All of this documentation must be official copies.For official transcripts, contact your previous school. They will send a transcript for you. However, you will often need to pay a fee, though some high schools do it for free.

, To fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), you need to have your tax returns done. If you're a dependent, you'll need your parent's tax returns done as well. Since federal aid is based on income, the FAFSA needs tax information.A dependent means your parents still claim you as a dependent on your tax return. In that case, their incomes will be used to determine your financial aid. It's also based on your age. The FAFSA can help you determine your dependency status, as it asks you a series of questions.If you must turn in your FAFSA before your tax returns are done, you can estimate your information when you turn it in. Later, you will need to amend your FAFSA with the proper information., The best way to fill out the FAFSA is online at the government's website for FAFSA. However, you can also download a form to print and mail in, or if you prefer, you can request a paper form by calling 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243).Filling out online make the process faster, plus you can save some data year to year.

, Creating an ID is not absolutely essential, but it makes the process much easier. If you create a FSA ID, you can sign your FAFSA electronically, as well as pull in information from the IRS.To create an ID, you will need to give an email address and a username. You will also need to create a password, as well as enter some biographical information, including your Social Security number.Once you submit it, you need to verify your email by clicking a link that the website sends to you., Basically, you will need to complete biographical information. You'll will also need to list your school or potential schools so they will also receive the information. Most of the time, you can use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool, which just means the FAFSA will automatically pull in information from the IRS to fill out the income data you need for your FAFSA., Your school will likely have a deadline for you applying for financial aid. Keep in mind that the FAFSA can take as long as a month to be returned to you with your financial aid package, so you need to start it well in advance of the deadline.Your community college's deadlines should be up on their website with the admissions information. If it's not, contact the financial aid office at your school.
You usually need to apply for financial aid before you're accepted. However, sometimes it's not as crucial for community colleges as it is for traditional colleges because their financial aid deadlines are often not as early. Still, it's best to check when the deadline is.
Your state may also have deadlines, so use the FAFSA's website to calculate yours. They have a place where you put in your state of residence and the school year you'll need financial aid, and it will tell you what your state's deadlines are., Many schools have a separate application for scholarships.Scholarship awards can be based on income, minority status, grades, and a whole host of other factors, so fill it out even if you don't think you're eligible.


You should also consider looking for scholarships outside of your community college. Check with some of your local charitable organizations, such as the Rotary Club. Many of these organizations give out scholarships. You can also look at scholarship search engines or ask at the financial aid office at your college. Your high school's guidance counselor office should have information, as well.

, Before you enroll, you need to be accepted to the school. Your community college should have information up on when you will receive your letter, so if you don't receive one around that time, contact your school. If you're not accepted, you can always try again for another semester, though you may need to retake some tests and do better on them to gain admission., Before enrolling, many schools have you meet with an adviser. In place of that, some schools will have a group registration and enrollment session. Find out what your school requires.While it may seem like a pain, these sessions can help you sort out what classes you'll need to enroll in, as well as what you need to do to complete registration.

, Once you've been admitted, you need to sign up for classes. Generally, your program will have specific classes you need to take. Often, you will need to take them in a specific order, which will be laid out. Sign up for the first classes you need.These days, you can usually sign up for classes online. Sometimes, you need an adviser's approval first.
If you can't sign up online, you can visit the registrar's office.

, While your financial aid will cover much of your school, it may not cover all of it. If it doesn't, you'll need to finish paying for the classes yourself. Luckily, community college isn't as expensive as four-year colleges.

You'll likely be able to pay online. If not, go to the registrar's office.

Write down your grades.,
Use a grading scale to note how many points each letter grade is worth.,
List how many credits each course is worth.,
Determine how many grade points (credit points) you earned for your courses.,
Determine your semester GPA by dividing credit points by coursework hours.,
Add up your credit points.,
Calculate how many credits you took.,
Calculate your overall or cumulative GPA.",How to Figure out Your College GPA," Write down a list of what classes you took during the term. Next to each class, write down the grade you earned. Don't worry about writing down a percentage, just note the letter grade that you got. For example, your list may look something like this:


Biology: B
Calculus: A
History: A
Spanish: C;
, Use your school's grading scale to determine how many points each letter grade earns. For example, you'd build on your list like this:Biology: B (3 points)
Calculus: A (4 points)
History: A (4 points)
Spanish: C (2 points)

, Once you've made your list, look in your school's course catalog to determine how many credits each course is worth. Sometimes, seminars or labs may be worth fewer credits so it's important to calculate how many credits you took in a term. Write down how many credits each course is worth. For example, your list may now look something like this:Biology: B (3 credit points) at 3 hours
Calculus: A (4 credit points) at 4 hours
History: A (4 credit points) at 3 hours
Spanish: C (2 credit points) at 3 hours

, For each course on your list, multiply the credit for your grade by the number of hours the course was worth. Once you've done this for each course, you can add up all of the grade points (credit points) to calculate your total grade points (credit points) for the term. Your list may look like this:Biology: B (3 credit points) at 3 hours = 9 credit points
Calculus: A (4 credit points) at 4 hours = 16 credit points
History: A (4 credit points) at 3 hours = 12 credit points
Spanish: C (2 credit points) at 3 hours = 6 credit points
Total = 43 credit points

, Take your total credit points and divide this number by the number of credit hours you took. Remember not to count any classes you withdrew from.For example, you would divide 43 (credit points) by 13 (credit hours) to get a weighted GPA of 3.3.

, You can write down a list of all of your credit points, but it will probably be easiest to find this using your transcript. Write down the total credit points from each semester or term. These are sometimes called quality points. Add the points from every semester or term up to determine your total credit points.For example, if you earned 55 credit points for your first term and 29 points for your second term, you would have a total of 84 credit (or quality) points.

, Write down how many credit hours you took for every term or semester. Add these numbers together to get your total credit hours.For example, if you earned 17 credit hours for your first term and 12 credit hours for your second term, you would have a total of 29 credit hours.

, Take your total credit points and divide this number by your total credit hours. This will average out your grade points for every semester and term you included.For example, take 84 (your total credit points) divided by 29 (total credit hours) to get a 2.89 cumulative GPA.

Graduate.",How to Earn an Undergraduate Degree in Philosophy," If you want to study philosophy, a comprehensive education will be an advantage - so study widely and in fields where you can show your intellectual strengths. Much contemporary philosophy is written with a strong focus on logic and mathematical clarity. Study of formal logic and mathematics will be useful, as will study of physics, biology, computing, psychology, social science and so on. Similarly though, humanistic study will also be useful in reading and interpreting texts and placing them within historical context: history, literature, politics and law, social sciences. Study academic subjects, and look at the subjects required by universities for entrance to guide your choices at school.


Some countries offer philosophy in schools: studying at the high school level lets you sample philosophy before making a commitment to study it at the undergraduate level. In the United Kingdom, most people enter philosophy from religious education - but be sure to check that your school offers an A-level religious education curriculum that covers the ethics and philosophy of religion modules. Some schools offer courses in critical thinking, critical reasoning, ethics and other topics which would prepare the way to study philosophy.
Philosophy requires clarity of thought and expression, so ensure that you are able to write clearly and read well.;
, Read some philosophical books - there are a variety of philosophical primers intended for the ordinary reader - or go online and sample philosophical podcasts and videos like the Philosophy Bites podcasts series or the Philosophy Talk show.

, You ought to apply widely to a lot of different universities, and take the time to learn something about the departments. Different departments have different interests and staff, and will offer different course options. If you have a particular interest, try to find a department that offers lots of opportunity to study that.

, If you are studying philosophy, you'll get out exactly what you put in. Be sure to attend lectures and to participate in seminars. Seminar participation is essential for passing some courses, but even if it isn't, philosophy is a subject which requires you to actually practice thinking about the topics studied, and to do that you need to try to discuss your intuitions and reason in a collective seminar setting.

, When reading, try to critically evaluate what you read - when you are reading a book, ask yourself whether each of the assertions the author makes is a reasonable one and is backed up by evidence. Keep track of your reasoning process while reading a book, and make notes of this reasoning, especially if you disagree in a non-trivial way with what is being said.


Be sure to have something philosophical to read wherever you are, even if it isn't directly related to what you are studying in class. You'll eventually start seeing links between the different topics.

, You'll have to write essays, but remember these are not the same kind of essays you'll have to write for examination. Examinations in philosophy can be daunting as unlike a subject like history or some branches of science, adding more facts doesn't necessarily get you any further in answering the question. Knowing the theories under discussion is important, but you need to be able to independently reason about them rather than remember the exact year that Hegel was born. Most universities will make available previous exam papers for modules - sometimes online, sometimes you'll have to get them from the library or from the module tutor.

, Some universities give you the opportunity to benefit from one-on-one or two-on-one tuition - if you can get this, it'll help tremendously. You'll learn much more about how to improve your work and to get better results in examination if you can

, Universities often have a philosophical society. While this is less fun than the scuba diving club, lacrosse or jujitsu, you can often hear some top-class philosophers presenting their work. Keep an eye out on the departmental noticeboard or online to learn about conferences, workshops, seminars and other events. Some of these may be oriented towards graduate-level students, but they do have an important purpose...

, Not all courses require this, but many do require a dissertation, a ""long essay"" or a series of essays that form a coherent project. Hopefully, if you've been attending events, reading widely (including things not on the reading list), you'll have some interesting questions that you can work on. If you've been attending lectures and tutorials, you will know staff you can approach to supervise.

, While philosophy graduates are often the butt of jokes about unemployment, philosophy graduates are often highly employable in a wide variety of fields. Some people enjoy philosophy so much that they decide to carry on and study at master's or Ph.D level. Philosophy graduates can get jobs in a variety of different sectors: the legal profession, management, computer programming and technology, journalism/writing, entertainment, engineering, the public or charitable sectors, politics, the clergy or many areas of business.


Some well-known philosophy graduates: Ricky Gervais (creator of The Office), Matt Groening (creator of The Simpsons), Wes Anderson (director of The Royal Tenenbaums), Carly Fiorina (former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, now political candidate), Michael Frayn (playwright and novelist), Rudy Giuliani (former New York City mayor and Republican politician), Phil Jackson (basketball coach), David Souter and Stephen Breyer (justices of the Supreme Court of the United States), Oliver Letwin (British Conservative politician), William J. Bennett (Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Education), Paul Martin (former Canadian Prime Minister), Pope John Paul II, Pope Benedict XVI, Ben Goldacre (science writer), Larry Sanger (co-founder of Wikipedia), Studs Terkel (Pulitzer Prize winning writer), Jonathan Dimbleby (British television presenter) and many more.

Know your reasons.,
Analyze your prospects.,
Look for warning signs.,
Be aware of the potential consequences.,
Talk to your professors about your decision.,
Finish out the semester.,
Withdraw from the school.,
Stop showing up.,
Go on hiatus.,
Have a job lined up.,
Take part in an apprenticeship.,
Start your own business.",How to Drop Out of College," Cutting your college career short is a big move, one that requires a lot of deliberation. Be able to come up with at least one major reason why finishing school isn’t in your best interest. If you’re going to take the plunge, you should do it with a clear purpose in mind.Feeling like your classes are too hard is not a strong enough reason to justify dropping out—realizing that you don’t need a formal education to do what you love is.;
, What would you be doing if it weren’t for school? Take inventory of the options you have available to you. It may be that you’re more interested in looking into a career in the military or you’re already working an internship that promises to lead to a full-time position. Find out whether (and how) it would be possible for you to land your dream job without a degree.
Be realistic about your other opportunities. Assuming that you’ll find a way to make things work without a concrete plan could just end up putting you in a more difficult position.

, While getting an education is important, your own health and wellbeing should come before anything else. Depression and deep-rooted dissatisfaction are not normal parts of the college experience. Being a student can be stressful at times, but that anxiety shouldn’t be consuming your life. If you discover that it is, you may be doing yourself more harm than good.If you’re feeling unfulfilled, it may just mean that you’re overworked or that it’s time to choose a different field of study.
A lack of motivation can cause your performance to suffer even if you choose to remain in school., No matter your motivations for calling it quits, you’ll be giving something up in the process. Keep in mind that by discontinuing your education, you might be forced to forfeit scholarships, grants or other benefits that you’ve managed to secure. It could also strain your relationship with your family if they don’t agree with your decision.Some schools don’t allow students who have dropped out to re-enroll, which could limit your opportunities should you make up your mind to go back later on.
Repaying students after dropping out will leave you stuck with the financial burden of going to college and none of the advantages., A trusted professor or adviser will be able to help you clarify your reasons for leaving and offer prudent advice about what to do next. Even if you’re not interested in hearing what they have to say, letting your instructors know that you’ll no longer be participating in their class is common courtesy.Meet with your professors in person to explain your circumstances instead of sending them a cursory email or leaving them to guess what happened to you., If the term is already underway and you’ve missed the deadline to drop classes, it may be a good idea to just see it through. That way, you won’t have to worry about ruining your GPA. When the following semester rolls around, you can tie up a few administrative loose ends and make a clean break.Completing a semester will leave you with a documented final grade and not a more ambiguous “W” or “I.”
The more classes you have under your belt, the more experience you’ll be able to show employers.

, As part of the withdrawal process, you’ll be asked to fill out a few forms and provide a reason for leaving. After that, your enrollment will be brought to a close. However, as long as your status as a student remains in good standing, you’ll always have the option of coming back if and when you’re ready.Speak with your academic adviser about the specific steps you’ll need to take to withdraw from your university or community college.
In most cases, you’ll still be responsible for paying off student loans, housing fees and other expenses for an aborted semester., The easiest way to drop out is to simply do nothing. Your professors will eventually get the hint when you cease to attend lectures or respond to emails. While this isn’t the most considerate way to take your leave, it may be the only option for students who are short on time or dealing with an injury or family emergency.

Expect to receive failing grades for incomplete coursework, which can come back to haunt you should you resume your education in the future.You’ll be burning a lot of bridges by simply walking away. Unless you’re positive that it’s recommended that you find a more tactful way to make your intentions known.

, Rather than giving up on academics once and for all, think of your decision to drop out as simply taking a break. If things work out in your favor, you’ll have made the right call and you’ll be free to pursue a more meaningful path. In the worst case scenario, you’ll have learned that college was worth your time after all and you can pick right up where you left off.Come up with a two, five or ten-year plan for yourself. At the end of that time, reevaluate whether higher education is essential for success in your chosen field.
When you look at dropping out as a temporary measure, it can make the whole ordeal a lot less scary., If you weren’t already working to put yourself through school, you’ll definitely need to find employment to make ends meet once you’re on your own. Even a part-time job will serve as a safety net and give you a chance to build up your funds while preparing for what may come—just be willing to start at the bottom and work your way up, since you’ll be coming in with fewer credentials.Sales, retail management, customer service, office administration and waiting tables can all be lucrative jobs for those who don’t hold graduate degrees.For some people, leaving school can actually be a plus, since it allows them focus their time and attention on a job they’re passionate about.

, Find someone who does what you want to be doing and ask them to take you under their wing. Many trade and vocational schools offer apprenticeships for professions like carpentry, plumbing and automotive repair. Learning the ropes firsthand from an experienced craftsman is an excellent way to gain practical knowledge that will help you break into a new industry.Apprenticeship programs tend to be cheaper, shorter and more specialized than working towards a degree at a traditional university or community college.Run a search online to find out which companies and organizations offer apprenticeship opportunities in your area.

, Apply your unique set of skills and expertise in a line of work you enjoy while filling a need at the same time. Your small business endeavor could be anything from personal training to clothing design to app development. You’ll have the freedom to make your own decisions, set your own hours and realize your vision for the company. Best of all, you can take satisfaction in knowing that you did it all without a college degree.Getting a new business off the ground requires capital, so you may have to save up for a few years before you can make your dream a reality.Many of the world’s most successful entrepreneurs got their start after dropping out of college, including Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Steve Jobs, Ted Turner and Mark Zuckerberg."

Consider your passions, interests, and values.,
Think of your favorite subjects and classes in high school.,
Consider job prospects, but don't obsess over them.,
Decide what type of degree you want.,
Read the course catalog at your college or university.,
Consider your school's reputation.,
Set up a meeting with a counselor.",How to Decide on Your Major," These questions are extremely important, but are far too often overlooked by students. Instead, people tend to ask themselves: ""What jobs can I get with this major?"" ""What can I do with this major?"" It's important to remember that your major isn't necessarily a direct route to a future career. Even if you do get the job you were planning on getting your freshman year, the best way to ensure happiness and success in that job is to do something you care about. And that starts with your education.


When considering your passions, think beyond hobbies like sports or musical instruments. Think about the impact that you want to make on the world and the legacy you want to leave behind. Are you passionate about business? Do you want to save the environment? Are you an artist? Do you love math? Do you want to be a doctor?
Keep in mind that not only may your interests change over the next four years, but that technology and the economy are constantly changing. By the time you graduate, the job you were planning on getting could be obsolete, while hundreds of new jobs that never existed before may have emerged.;
, Even if you don't know what you want to be ""when you grow up,"" you can still determine your skills and interests by looking back at your academic history. Consider not only which subjects you enjoyed the most, but which subjects you excelled at.


Which classes were the most exciting and inspiring to you? Were they science classes? Math classes? English classes? Creative classes like art or theater?
Consider which classes you performed the best in. ""Easy A"" classes don't count; think of challenging and comprehensive classes in which you performed well.

, Don't think of choosing a major as applying for a job; think of it as choosing your life's path. The jobs, internships, and other opportunities that open up for you as a result of following your passion come second. On the other hand, if your passion lines up with your career plans, then choose the major that will get you there fastest. If you want to be a doctor and have always wanted to be a doctor, then consider majoring in biology.

, While you may still be totally lost, you can narrow down your decision by deciding between a Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Sciences (BS). Remember that the classifications for BA and BS may vary between schools, but in general, the following guidelines apply:



BA degrees include liberal arts and social science majors like Political Science, International Relations, English, Art History, Sociology, and Cultural Anthropology.

BS degrees include science and math majors like Engineering, Biology, Evolutionary Anthropology, and Economics.

, If you have already been accepted to a school, then read the course catalog to learn about the different majors, their requirements, and the types of courses involved. Remember that sometimes the titles of classes are misleading, so be sure to read some of the course descriptions for more details.


Be sure to read an up-to-date course catalog, as majors and their requirements change over time.
Take into account the number of units you will need to take, the subject matter, and the work load.

, Does your school specialize in Journalism? Agriculture? Medicine? Engineering? If the quality of the education you receive is of utmost importance to you and you are still undecided between majors, then consider which departments or majors your school is most well-known for.


Do some research on your college to learn about which departments are most reputable, and which professors are most esteemed and recognized in the academic community.

, Whether you are undecided between two or more majors, or have absolutely no idea what major to choose, then set up a meeting with a counselor at your college. If you haven't graduated yet, then set up a meeting with your high school counselor.


Remember that colleges have counselors that specialize in different departments, so they can fill you in on any unanswered questions.

Read up on faculty biographies. A good business school will have professors on staff who are experts in their field and accessible to students. Research the people who are teaching classes by doing Internet searches or talking to mentors and fellow students. See what they have published and accomplished.

, Make an appointment to meet with someone in the admissions department of the business school you are considering. They will often be happy to answer any questions you have about attendance, demographics and academic performance.

, Most business schools will host open houses, or provide tours of the campus through the admissions department.


Ask if you can attend a class or lecture. This will help you get an idea of how classes are managed at the business school.

, You can find graduates through social networking sites, or through contacts and networking in the professional world.

During the initial years, many students may not have decided on whether, where, and in which branch to pursue post graduation. One should try to develop your goals as early as possible. The best time would be by the first year and the eleventh hour would be by the internship/house-surgency period.;
, Try to find out who else among your seniors have gone for the option you are considering and try to contact them. Find out if the option is feasible for you, taking all things into consideration. This would include finance, family relations, etc

, This is the most difficult part for international students. The qualifying exams are called USMLE - United States Medical Licensing Examinations. There are four exams in total - Step 1, Step 2 (CK), Step 2 (CS), and Step 3. The first two can be taken in all countries, but the last two can only be taken in the U.S.


The USMLE Step 1 is centered around the subjects learned during the first two years of medical school, i.e. anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, microbiology, pharmacology, and pathology. In addition, there are three more subjects to the list - epidemiology, psychiatry, and ethics. The best time to write the exam would be after your third year.






Step 2 CK - CK stands for clinical knowledge. This exam is based on topics learned in the final year - medicine, surgery, ob/gyn, pediatrics, epidemiology, and ethics.






Step 2 CS - CS stands for clinical skills. This exam tests your practical skills, communication, and bedside manners. This exam is currently given only in the U.S. Therefore, many international students will have to apply for a visiting visa to go to the U.S. for the exam.







, This organization helps with the initial application and details. There are various PDF links on their site that provides all the necessary information regarding the paper work to be done. This is an important site to refer to through this process.

, Once the above exams are passed, you will be certified by the ECFMG, and a very impressive certificate will be awarded to you. After this, you are eligible for applying for residency.

, For international students, the clinical practices in U.S. will be slightly different from what may have been seen in other countries. This is something to be seriously considered for residency, as it is important for you to have had some sort of clinical experience in U.S. This includes electives, internship, observer-ship, research, or volunteering, with electives being your best option. Elective - Doing part of your internship in the U.S. This is possible and a lot of international students do apply and do electives in U.S. medical schools every year. Internship - This is for people who have already graduated from medical school. You can follow a doctor working in the U.S. and can get involved in clinics. Observer-ship - You can follow and observe a doctor in the U.S. but you cannot deal directly with patients. In addition, you can be part of any research experience or be a volunteer at any free clinics. The longer you have any USCE, the better your chances are. It is important to note that duration is more important than the type of USCE.

, This site should be used to study each program's website and create a list of programs that you want to apply to. This is also the software through which you will apply for residency.

, The details of this complicated process can be obtained from the site of NRMP.

, The duration depends on your branch of specialization. You can write Step 3 either during residency or before that during the match season. Completing Step 3 before match will make you eligible for work visa vs just a student visa.

, In case you don't match, there is another procedure called SOAP (Supplemental Offer and Acceptance Program). The unfilled colleges and unmatched candidates try to contact each other. Every year, many students get placed through match and also through SOAP.

, After residency, you can go for fellowship or you can practice what you have learned. There are many who go for fellowships, and many others who join as hospitality., Best of luck!

Attend orientation.,
Meet your faculty adviser.,

Live the college dream.",How to Enroll In a Tribal College," This part can be very intimidating as you may not know what to expect. The steps below will help give you an idea of what to expect.;
, You will need any high school transcripts and a copy of your high school diploma or G.E.D. Admissions will have you fill out any necessary paperwork that is required for your college application. This process can take a bit so make sure to fill out everything correctly and ask any questions you may have.


If you have not graduated from high school or have not gotten your G.E.D., the college can help direct you to the correct place to help obtain either of these items.

, After you have filled out any paperwork, now is the time to sit down and speak with your financial aid officer and see which grants, loans, or monies are available for you. This process can take a while, as the applications are extensive and time consuming, but well worth it. Native Americans may receive special grants usually from your reservation or from the American Indian College Fund. There are many grants out there and for many different things, such as; FASA, The Coca-Cola Foundation, and American Indian Education Foundation. Research and put effort into filling out an application for a grant, or loan as this will greatly ensure that your financial needs are being met.


You will not have to pay back any grants that you receive, but you will have to pay back a loan that is usually with high interest.
Usually there are deadlines for grants and loans. The best time of the year to research and fill out grants is early in the spring.

, When you are finished speaking with the college’s financial aid officer, you then will be directed to take a short test. This can be scary, but do not stress because it will help you out in the long run.


Remember failing certain aspects of this test will decide whether or not you need to any refresher courses.

, After you have figured out what areas of study you need to refresh up on, the college admissions process is pretty much done. You then will be informed if you are accepted via the U.S. postal service.

, Once you have found out that you are accepted into the tribal college, they will inform you of an orientation day in which will give you tons of information on grants, how loans work, teachers, and school rules. The orientation is very informative and will help with any other questions you may have. A student I.D. is usually issued around this time, and this will give you access to any school equipment or library resources. This is mandatory for all students!

, During orientation, you will be assigned a school adviser. The relationship that you have with your student adviser is very important, as this person will help guide you through your college years and whatever decisions you make. You will then sit down with him/her and discuss what classes you need and what times your classes will be.


This part is very important as you will find out that time management is important.

, This step can be very intimidating because you want to make sure you schedule classes to your time schedule. These classes vary depending on what you want to major in, but there will be general and required classes that you will have to complete before you can graduate. Your faculty adviser will help assist you in any class schedule questions you may have.


A good mix of required and elective classes will help make sure you have a variety of homework: college writing, speech, algebra, media arts, cooking, and computer skills classes are good examples of a variety of classes you may take. Homework can be very time consuming and stressful, especially if you have similar classes.

, Orientation is complete and you’re now officially a college student. The next step is to show up to class prepared and ready to learn, as this is a huge step into your new life. Congratulations!

Recognize the importance of accreditation.,
Determine if your school is accredited.,
Look up the school’s graduation rate.,
Look up the school’s loan default rate.",How to Ensure Online Degree Credibility1," Colleges and universities are reviewed by outside, non-governmental sources to ensure that the school meets certain educational standards. These organizations review the school’s student services and resources, faculty, degree programs, curriculum, and many other elements that make up a robust academic atmosphere. This is important when selecting an online program because it ensures that your school has been reviewed and meets basic academic standards., Most schools will state on their website that they have the proper accreditation, but it is important to keep digging for more information. Since accreditation bodies are non-governmental organizations, they are not guided by generalized metrics and standards. Phony accrediting bodies exist as do accrediting bodies with bare-minimum academic standards.Refer to the U.S.-based Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) to determine if your school has legitimate accreditation. CHEA is an organization that helps certify schools and accrediting organizations. They maintain an international database, so be sure to check out their website for more information on your potential online school.
If you are in the U.S., see if your school is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. This is another way to verify a school’s credibility.

, Reviewing a school’s graduation rate can reveal a lot about the institution.If the graduation rate is low, this could indicate that the academic programs are lacking.


If your potential school is based in the U.S., the Federal Student Aid office, which is a part of the U.S. Department of Education, makes it easy to check these facts and figures online. Their online Federal School Code Search allows you to compare up to 10 schools at once. Just type in the school’s name, and the website will provide this information in a simple, straight-forward table., A loan default rate measures the percentage of individuals who are unable to pay back his or her loans. If a school has a high loan default rate, it could indicate that the school does not provide sound financial guidance.This information can help you gauge a school’s credibility and reliability.


If you are going to school in the U.S., refer to the U.S. Department of Education’s online database, Official Cohort Default Rates for Schools, to discover your school’s loan default rate.

Discover how long it takes to earn a degree.,
Look at the financial commitment.,
Check for familiar names.,
Look for student services.,
Review the instructor qualifications.,
Understand the impact.",How to Ensure Online Degree Credibility2," Be wary if an online school promises that it is fast and easy to earn a degree; this could be a sign that it is a diploma mill. A diploma mill churns out fraudulent degrees, certificates, and diplomas, and they can be earned with little to no effort from you. Real, accredited institutions require that you complete significant coursework to earn your degree., A scam school may request a large sum of money upfront for your degree, or offer discounts if you enroll in multiple programs. Accredited universities typically will not ask for a flat fee and will charge students per semester based on the number of credits taken during that period., If a school’s name seems familiar or reminds you of a famous, prestigious institution, this could be a red flag.A scam school is counting on the chance that you may recognize the name with the hope that you will be sold on their program's authenticity.

, Check to see if the online school has a team of administrators, a technology support program, library services, and other resources for students. Support systems are important for academic success and should be in place in any legitimate academic environment. Be skeptical if the school does not offer this or makes it difficult to find this information., Take the time to review the instructors' biographies, educational history, their impact in their field of study, and if they have adequate publication records.A credible school and program will attract successful instructors who contribute to his or her specialty.

, Claiming a degree from an unaccredited scam school or diploma mill can have lasting impacts on your professional credibility and personal life. Listing the degree on your resume or CV will not help you in your job search; most employers will review a school or program that they have never heard of and begin to ask questions.A fraudulent degree can prevent you from securing a new job and can be grounds for termination or prosecution at an existing job."

Refer to your school’s alumni group.,
Ask potential employers about online degrees.,
Show that you’re a team player.",How to Ensure Online Degree Credibility3," Once you have selected a trustworthy, accredited online school, make use of your school’s alumni association. Talk with alumni and ask how his or her degree has helped in the workforce, if employers have raised questions regarding the school’s credibility, and how he or she responded to these questions. This tips and real-life experiences will help you as you begin to interview and look for employment opportunities., More and more employers are becoming more familiar, accepting, and confident about hiring candidates with online degrees from accredited programs.If you are nervous about how your online degree may look on your resume, reach out to potential employers and ask about the company’s expectations. See what you can do to demonstrate that your degree is viable and applicable.

, Before going into a job interview, be prepared to cite examples of how your online program fostered networking, collaboration, and teamwork.Provide evidence that can help an employer better understand an online program’s value and how your experiences will be beneficial to the company.

Throw in some other items to your routine.",How to Eat Cheap While in College," If you live in the dorms, you might be required to purchase a meal plan. If not, you still might want to take the opportunity to purchase one. Meal plans typically are cheaper than eating out, if not than cooking at home. Calculate the expenses and determine what plan is appropriate for your schedule.


Meals plans vary significantly in price. To determine if yours is worth the investment, divide the price of the plan by the number of meals included.The hidden expense of meal plans is that you often can’t use all of your meals, so you pay for more than you get. To avoid this, visit the dinning hall for every meal you are entitled to.
Typically, meal plans offer the choice of two or three meals a day. If you don’t believe you will be able to get to lunch most days of the week, consider signing up for two meals a day. Snack on other items during the middle of the day.Meals plans have plenty of additional benefits. They offer a greater variety of food than you would typically be able to afford shopping, meaning that you can eat healthier. It saves you time and effort during a busy period of your life. Best of all, the dining hall is a great opportunity to socialize.
Although it is typically against the rules, you can get the most of your meal plan by bringing some back home with you. Take a Ziploc bag and bring back some non-perishables, like baked goods. This can be a good way to turn your two meals per day into three.;
, Many students have rarely cooked before entering college. However, it is the cheapest way to eat. There are many cheap, hardy recipes that require little skill.


Restaurants in college towns can be cheap, but don’t be deceived. Even the cheapest restaurant food can be several times more expensive than food cooked at home.
Also avoid precooked meals, like TV dinners. Though cheaper than eating out, they are more expensive than home cooked meals and generally less hardy.

, The best sources of sustained energy are unrefined carbohydrates, protein, and unsaturated fats. Sugary foods, like candy or processed cereals, give only short bursts of energy.Consider purchasing vitamins. Cheap, hardy meals are often short on fruit and vegetables. You can compensate for this with vitamin supplements.

, A large lunch can actually cause your energy level to crash at the end of the day. Small, frequent meals, composed of healthy items like protein and unrefined carbohydrates, are the best way to make the most of your food.For midday snacks, consider nuts, bananas, and cheese.
Try to buy your snacks in the bulk aisle. Food is typically cheaper there.

, Water can be a good source of energy. It can also make you feel full when you’re trying to make the most of a less than fulfilling meal. Try chugging a large glass of water about 30 minutes before you begin your meal., Many campus organizations hold events that offer free food. Keep a close eye on what campus events are coming up and try to drop by as many as possible to get a free bite to eat.


Many academic departments also have their own coffee machines. These can be a useful way to cut down on the expense of your caffeine habit., You don't want to starve yourself unnecessarily or find yourself without the funds to feed yourself before the semester is over. At the beginning of the year, determine how much money you have for food. Divide that number by the number of weeks in your term. Spend only this amount at the store each week.


Periodically, maybe once a month, check your bank account to determine if you are on track. If not, readjust your budget to reflect your current funds.

, Check the local newspaper for coupons and sales that you can take advantage of. Know which stores are the best for specific types of food. Some stores have great prices for pre-made meals, whereas others specialize on fresh produce.


Many stores have cards that allow you to get special deals. Be sure to get one of these. It only takes a little bit of time to sign up and the savings can be significant.

, One certain way to spend more money than you want at the store is to buy everything that looks appetizing. Only deviate from the list if it is to take advantage of great deals. In the long run, sticking to a list will improve your understanding of what you need at the store and cut down on expensive food waste.

, Fruits and vegetables are cheaper when they are in season. Look up what is in season and try to stick to these items when you are at the store.


There are now websites that will allow you to input the month and your location to determine what is currently in season. Do this prior to writing up your shopping list, so that you will have a plan before entering the grocery store., Brand name items cost more than generics. Plain items are also cheaper. For example, you can purchase unflavored yogurt and add fruit or jam, rather than purchasing pre-flavored yogurt. Avoid the chicken at the butcher that has been pre-spiced; you can spice your own chicken for a fraction of the price.

, Many items are cheaper when you buy in large portions; there are even specialized stores that sell in bulk for a fraction of the item’s normal price. To take advantage of these deals without letting food go to waste, put some in the freezer for later.


Some of the best foods to buy in bulk include: oatmeal, dry pasta, dry beans, and dry rice. Until they are cooked, these items last virtually forever. That means you don't need to worry about them going bad because you bought more than you could eat., If you are living a dorm, your access to a full kitchen could be limited. In that case, you might want to buy a few small appliances to keep yourself well fed. Alternatively, purchase items that don't require refrigeration and cooking.


Consider purchasing a mini-fridge. This will allow you to keep some perishable items in your dorm room.
A hot plate, which generally costs around $50, is a good way to quickly heat up items in a small space.
A pan is important. Also, consider a large wooden spoon that can be used to stir and serve food.
Alternatively, consider equipping your room with some items that don't need preparation. These include fruits, nuts, and processed snack foods.

, Start off cooking meals that are cheap and pose little risk for foodborne illness. Consider watching someone else cook once or twice or cooking for someone who can correct your mistakes.


Meat is both expensive and can cause serious illness if improperly cooked. Better foods to start out with include rice, beans, and pasta.
Cook books often have overly complicated recipes that require very specific ingredients and equipment you might not have. Stick to the internet. It is replete with recipes that will help you make use of whatever ingredients you have on hand.

, Oatmeal is incredibly cheap and a good source of energy. You can purchase it in pre-flavored packets that require little effort to make. It is cheaper, however, to purchase a huge container and add your own ingredients.


Tossing bananas into your oatmeal is a good way to provide additional flavor, make it hardier, and finish off fresh food. Bananas are typically one of the cheapest fruits available. They can be around $0.40 per pound. Keep in mind that these tend to have a short shelf life., Eggs are one of the cheapest sources of protein. You can fry them up for breakfast. But if you want a midday snack that you can carry around, consider boiling them. Hard boiled eggs are a great way to get energy, come in their own container, and keep well., These are incredibly cheap and easy to make. Nut butters, whether they are peanut butter, almond butter, or sunflower seed butter are hardy. All the ingredients are easy to keep. PB&J sandwiches make a good midday snack for the student on a budget., Ramen is an incredibly popular college lunch for good reason. It is cheap, quick, and requires almost no cooking skill. However, you can add additional ingredients to it to make it tastier and healthier. Good options include:


Beef and broccoli
Chicken
Vegetables
Ground beefRamen can be as cheap as $0.20 - $0.40 per pack: Just add water, heat in microwave, and serve.

, If you buy unprocessed rice and beans in bulk, you can make this hearty dinner for as little as $.44. Instead of canned beans, buy dry, bagged beans. You will need to soak these in water overnight, but that does not require much work.Rice and beans stay fresh indefinitely until they are cooked. After cooking them though, they will only keep about five days.Rice and beans are incredibly adaptable. Try throwing in some sausage or chicken. Creole spices and hot sauce can give it flavor, as can onions. You can also consider eating it with salsa and chips., Pasta is a great, hearty dinner that is cheap. It is easy to make. You can also add a variety of ingredients to pasta to change the way it tastes and the type of nutrients that you get from it.


You can use a variety of sauces. Tomato based sauces and alfredo sauces can be purchased premade at the store. You can also simply put olive oil on top of your pasta, for some healthy fats.
Pasta is also a good meal to incorporate cheese. Mozzarella and Parmesan go well on top of pasta.
For more vitamins, incorporate mushrooms, spinach, peas, onions, tomatoes, or cooked kale.
You can throw in all sorts of meat, including ground beef, chicken, and bacon.
Try multigrain pasta for more energy.Some discount stores sell pasta for only $0.75 a pound.

, Though the aforementioned options are good staples for living on a budget, a healthy diet requires a balance. Other food choices to consider include:


Soup can be a very cheap way to make sure that you get through your vegetables before they go back. Simply throw them in some broth and let them simmer. Eat with bread.
Cheese is a cheap, high protein, high calorie food.
Bagels are a hearty, cheap snack.Macaroni and cheese can be sold in packs of 3 for $1.00.
Potatoes can be bought in bulk. A 10-pound bag may cost only $3.49. Potatoes keep particularly well.
A 10-pound bag of chicken legs can cost as little as $4.99-$6.99.

Use a double boiler.,
Add your chocolate chips and cream to the double boiler.,
Remove the chocolate from heat.,
Use tongs to pick up each pretzel.,
Dip your pretzel in the chocolate.,
Allow the excess chocolate to drip off.,
Lay your chocolate-coated pretzel on wax paper.,
Add sprinkles or other toppings.,
Let your pretzels harden.",How to Make Chocolate Covered Pretzels," If you aren’t familiar, a double boiler is a set-up that almost looks like two pans in one. You fill the bottom pan with water and bring it to a simmer, which gently warms and melts the chocolate in the pan nestled on top. This works best for melting chocolate, because chocolate can burn easily. Melting it slowly and carefully is key.You can fashion your own double boiler by following the instructions here.
If you would rather melt your chocolate in the microwave, you certainly can. Place your melting chocolate into a microwave safe bowl. Set the timer for one minute, and set the heat to 50% power. After one minute of heating, remove the bowl and stir your chocolate. If it needs to melt more, put it in for 15 second intervals.;
, Set your stove to a low heat. Continue to stir as your mixture heats and begins to melt.Make sure to run your stirring utensil along the sides of the bowl so that all of the chocolate is being stirred thoroughly.


You can use milk chocolate, dark chocolate, or white chocolate variations.

, Once the chocolate is thoroughly melted and creamy, turn off the stove or remove the pot from the stovetop. You will want to dunk your pretzels in the chocolate while it is still very warm, but removing it from direct heat will ensure that it doesn’t burn., Tongs work well for this step, because you can pick up the pretzel and fully submerge it in the chocolate without making a huge mess. However, you can certainly use your hands, a fork, or another utensil if you don’t have tongs.You can eliminate the need for tongs if you use pretzel sticks. You can hold the pretzel stick at the end, dipping it as far as you want into the melted chocolate.

, Cover it completely in the melted chocolate, making sure that the entire surface is coated. If you’re holding the pretzel with tongs, be careful to switch where you’re gripping the pretzel in order to expose the entire pretzel to the chocolate.


Make sure to do this step slowly and carefully to ensure you do not burn yourself on the hot chocolate.
You aren't limited to using standard pretzels. You can play around with the large pretzel rods, small pretzel sticks, twisted pretzels, chunks, and more.

, After you’ve fully dipped the pretzel, raise it above the pot. Let the extra chocolate drip off the pretzel and back into the pot, so that you’re left with the proper amount of chocolate on the pretzel.If you skip this step, your pretzel may dry with uneven chunks of chocolate, which isn’t as aesthetically-pleasing.

, Once you’ve let the excess chocolate run off, gently place it on a piece of wax paper or parchment paper.Take extra care setting your pretzel onto the paper, trying not to mess up any of the warm chocolate. Fill up the entire sheet of paper with pretzels, making sure they aren’t touching.

, If you want to give your pretzels a little extra flair, add toppings while the chocolate is still warm. You can add things like sprinkles, crushed candy, chopped nuts, or anything else that will stick to the chocolate as it hardens. You can also drizzle things across the pretzels, like melted caramel or white chocolate. Get creative with this step!, To speed up this process, you can pop the trays into your refrigerator. Allow the sheets to sit for a few hours, checking them sporadically by touching them with your fingertips. Once you’re sure that the chocolate has completely hardened, you can serve them however you like! Put them on platters to serve at parties, give them out in clear little bags as party favors, or just eat them straight from the tray – they’re just that good!Store your leftovers in an airtight container in a cool place. Do not place them in a refrigerator, as the chocolate will ""sweat"" when they are brought to room temperature. The chocolate will actually seal the pretzel and keep it fresh longer, so they will last for a couple of weeks.

Point out that going to college doesn’t guarantee more money.,
Explain that you can’t afford going to college.,
Emphasize that there are other paths.,
Give a polite non-answer.",How to Defend Your Decision Not to Go to College1," Depending on the field you’d like to go into, a college degree just might not guarantee that you make more money than non-college graduates. This is especially true if you would be majoring in the creative arts, like creative writing or painting.You can say something like “Well, I’m really interested in pursuing a career in music, but the employment rate for music school graduates isn’t much different than the one for non-graduates. So college just doesn’t make much sense for me.”;
, College tuition is a lot more expensive than it was even ten years ago. That can make it hard to afford to go to even moderately priced colleges. If your parents can’t afford to help you and you’re not willing to take on student debt, it’s perfectly acceptable to explain that college just isn’t financially realistic for you right now.For example, you can say something like, “The colleges with programs I was interested in have pretty high tuitions, and it’s not something that financially possible right now.”
Some people might then push you to apply for financial aid, or loans, or try to make you feel like affordability isn’t a big deal because you’ll get a job later. It’s perfectly okay to keep repeating “It’s just not a possibility for me.” When it comes to you and your family’s finances, you don’t owe anyone an explanation.

, Not everyone needs to go to a four-year university to have a shot at a good career later in life. If you’re interested in fields like informational technology, healthcare, or manufacturing, trade school can give you the skills to enter the workforce sooner than a four-year degree would.For example, you can say something like, “Well, I’m really interested in informational technology, especially hardware architecture! So a trade school is actually a really great option for me instead of college, because it will give me the skills I need to succeed and get me into a job faster.”

, It can be really stressful to have to defend your decision about college, especially when everyone is going to be asking you about it as you go through your senior year. A polite non-answer gives you something to say without having to have a lengthy conversation with someone you might not know very well.For example, if someone asks if you’re going to college, instead of saying “no,” you can say something like, “I have a lot of options at the moment and I’m taking some time to look at all of them so I can make a good decision.”

Explore job options before you graduate.,
Apply for part- or full-time jobs in retail or service.,
Contact advisors at vocational or technical schools.,
Talk to people who didn’t go to college.",How to Defend Your Decision Not to Go to College2," There are plenty of jobs you can do with only a high school diploma. To defend your decision not to go to college, it’s best to explore those options before you graduate, so you can defend your decision not to go to college by listing the jobs you’ll be applying for.

For example, electrical power line installers and repair workers, millwrights, industrial machinery mechanics, community health workers, physical therapist aides, restaurant workers, and hospitality managers are all jobs that only require a high school diploma and some on-the-job training.

, Applying and interviewing for jobs can take a few weeks. If you're looking to make some money while you figure out your next steps or apply for jobs that require some training, consider working in retail or service. You'll likely get hired quickly and won't need any training., If you’re thinking about attending a vocational or technical school instead of a four-year college, talking to an advisor who is familiar with the programs offered at those schools can be really helpful. They can tell you what courses you’ll need to take, what their admissions requirements are, and what sort of employment rate their graduates have.There should be an admissions page on the websites of the schools you’re interested in. You can usually find contact information for advisors there, or you can make an appointment to see someone in person.
Start your email by saying: ""Dear Ms. Smith, I am considering applying to your school's IT program, but I have a few questions first. I'm available next Wednesday and Thursday between 10 am and 2 pm. Can we set up a time to meet? Thank you!""

, Everyone has heard the stories about super rich and successful people who never went to college. To help you figure out an alternative path after high school, talk to people you actually know who didn’t go, and ask them lots of questions. It can help you find something fulfilling that you never knew existed.

For example, you can say something like, “Uncle Jerry, I know you didn’t go to college after high school. Could you talk to me about it? What made you decide not to go? What did you do instead?”

Start the conversation by saying, ""Mom and Dad, I wanted to talk to you about my plans for after high school. I know you always really wanted me to go to college, but I'm not sure if that's the right path for me. I was hoping we could talk about my options.""

, If you don’t plan on attending college, sit down and write a plan for where you want to be in five years and then ten years. Write down what you want to be doing, where you want to be living, and how much money you want to be making.Your plans can be as detailed or as general as you like - just make sure they have goals that you can strive for. For example, list each year of the next 5 or 10, and then under the year list the things you want to have accomplished each year. They can be large or small.
Your five year plan might include where you want to be in school, when you want a promotion at work, or how much money you want to be able to save each year.

, If a lot of your friends are planning to go off to college, you might feel a little abandoned, or like no one understands what your experience will be like.

Kill the bird.,
Scald the bird.,
Remove the hair feathers.,
Put the bird on its back on a table.,
Cut the flaps of skin between the legs and beside the anus, opening up the body cavity.,
Insert a hand into the body cavity of the bird.,
Cut through the skin and joint where the thigh connects to the body.,
Cut just beneath the breast through the skin where the organs used to be.,
When preparing the bird, most people discard the back.,
If you desire boneless meat, is best to just stick your fingers through the meat and twist it off of the bone.,
Finally, you are ready for cooking.,
If you are storing the meat, it should be immediately packaged and cooled by refrigerating or freezing.",How to Butcher and Remove the Pin Feathers of a Turkey," If you are defeathering the bird, you are probably doing this yourself as well. Wearing work gloves and safety goggles is strongly advised. The best way to do this is to stun the bird with electricity, however, this is impractical for home processing. Hang the bird by its feet and, with a sharp knife, grip the head holding the beak shut with one hand while you cut through the side of the throat to the other side and pull the knife forward and out. This severs the carotid arteries and the jugular veins, as well as the trachea. Get back. The bird will flap and get blood everywhere, and you can lose an eye to a well placed flap of the wings (thus the goggles). It is a good idea to use this method to kill rather than simply breaking its neck because the heart continues to beat and helps empty the body of unneeded blood. If you believe this method causes too much pain and suffering for the bird, simply remove the entire head. The bird will be dead within seconds, however it will not bleed as well.;
, It should be completely immersed in water heated to roughly 145 °F (63 °C). Leave it for 45 seconds. Remove it and immediately (or as soon as you can touch it) remove the feathers by hand. They should be fairly easy to pull out. Remove all feathers by hand but ignore the filoplumes, which are the small hairs which are actually types of feathers.

, This is done with a source of flame. A blow torch or propane torch will work well for this, but don't get it too hot. Simply run the flame over the entire bird to ""singe"" the filoplumes off. Do not cook the bird! You are simply burning feathers, not skin and meat. Your bird is now ready for butchering.

, Begin by removing the feet by cutting between the knee joints with a sharp knife.

, Do not cut any organs! It will make a mess. Cut all the way around the anus and make a V-cut to remove the gland just beneath the anus.

, Scoop out all organs, including heart, liver, gizzard, kidneys, and air sacs (avian lungs, birds don't have lungs like we do). Throw everything away except the heart, liver, and gizzard if you plan to use them for something else such as giblet gravy. You should also scoop out the trachea and esophagus that is still embedded in the neck. This may take some force, but it will come. You are now ready to butcher.

, Then separate the legs from thighs using the same technique. Next, separate the wings where they connect to the body, again using the same technique.

, When you get to ribs, use poultry shears to break them and continue the cut. When these are separated you have completed butchering. You now have wings, drumsticks, thighs, breasts, and back. Of course if you want to keep the bird whole, say for Thanksgiving, skip this entire step.

, There is however, good dark meat on it. It is best to just pull it off by hand.

, Watch out for ligaments and either pull them off or cut them off. These can be very tough (they are said to be the strongest natural fiber).

, Wash all parts well and remove any leftover blood or feathers.

, Enjoy!

Dilute it with oil to use on your skin.",How to Extract Mint Oils from Leaves," Vodka, or another high-proof grain alcohol, is perfect for this, since it has both water and alcohol to dissolve the oils. While apple cider vinegar or glycerin can be used instead, the final tincture will be much less strong and have a shorter shelf life. White vinegar will also work, but have the same effect. These are good for children that cannot drink alcohol, although if you use this for baking, the alcohol bakes out.Homemade tinctures, just like vanilla extract you would buy in a store, are normally used in such small doses that the alcohol does not have a noticeable effect.


For dried mint leaves, use vodka containing 45–60% alcohol (90–120 proof).
For fresh mint leaves, since they already contain water, use vodka or Everclear with 90–95% alcohol (180–190 proof).;
, Chop a bundle of fresh mint leaves into two or three pieces, or mash the leaves with a clean cup base, so more oils will be exposed to the liquid.Dried mint leaves can be crumbled by hand instead, or left mostly whole.


Wash fresh mint leaves before chopping.
There's no need to remove the stems, but throw away any slick or dark leaves, as these may be rotting.

, Stuff the jar with mint, leaving as little as ½ inch (1.25 centimeters) of space if you want the option for a stronger tincture. You may use a smaller amount of mint leaves if you like, but you may end up with a less aromatic or flavorful result. Once the mint is in, pour the alcohol or other liquid into the jar, completely covering the leaves. Close the lid of the jar tightly.


The leaves may float at first. You can try to push them down with a spoon, but they should sink on their own after a few days.

, The exact length of time simply depends on how strong you want your tincture to be, but it usually takes between four and eight weeks.Most people prefer to store the jar in a dark place, since sunlight could lower the tincture's shelf life. Once or twice a week, shake the jar for a couple minutes to speed up the dissolving process.


You can taste a drop of the mixture to decide whether it's strong enough for you.

, Pour the liquid through a coffee filter to remove the leaves and sediment. Store the tincture in a brown glass container to protect it from sunlight and increase its shelf life. It can last for six months or more, although it may lose its potency gradually.


If the tincture has a vodka smell to it, or isn't as strong as you would like, leave the jar out for another week with a fresh coffee filter or cloth over the lid. Some of the alcohol will evaporate., Stir one to three drops into hot chocolate, hot water, or herbal tea. If your tincture is weak, you can add more. This adds up to an insignificant amount of alcohol, so don't worry about getting tipsy.


Drinking peppermint can help with some forms of indigestion, but avoid it if you have acid reflux (heartburn), or a hernia., Roughly 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) of your mint extract is enough to flavor a pan of brownies, or a batch of fudge or meringues. You may need to experiment with the amount used, since homemade tinctures vary in strength. For some recipes, such as frosting, it's easy to mix in a little at a time and test by taste.

, Peppermint extract can repel ants, flies, and moths, but has little effect on mice or rats.Dampen cotton balls with the tincture and place them around the area where pests were found. Replace the cotton balls once or twice a week.


Keep the cotton balls out of reach of pets.

, Some studies show that peppermint oil may enhance concentration. Drop the tincture onto a cloth and smell it before studying, then again before taking a test, or any time you feel stressed or tired.

, Mix a few drops in sweet almond oil, olive oil, shea butter, or any other skin-safe oil to make a salve. Rub it onto your chest to help with congestion, or onto sore muscles, joints, or poison ivy rashes to relieve the pain. Rub it onto your forehead and temples to fight tension headaches."

Trim the ends.,
Soak the cilantro.,
Remove excess water.,
Wrap the cilantro in a damp paper towel.,
Place the cilantro in an airtight container.,
Keep in the refrigerator.",How to Keep Cilantro Fresh1," Use kitchen shears to trim off the dry tip from each stem of cilantro. Take this time to also remove any damaged or dying leaves, as well.


To keep the end fresher and cause less shock to the plant, trim the stems under cool, running water.;
, Place the cilantro in a dish and cover the stems with cool water. Let them soak for five to ten minutes.


Soaking the cilantro removes all dirt and debris from the leaves. Since the leaves and stems will be moist when you use this method, cleaning the leaves beforehand is not an issue. If you were using a method that required the leaves to remain dry, however, you would wait until you were ready to use the herb before cleaning it.

, Remove the cilantro from the water and transfer the bunch into a salad spinner. Use this device to spin the wet herbs until they feel relatively dry to the touch.


You can also pat the cilantro dry in between layers of clean, dry paper towels or a with a clean kitchen towel. Make sure that the leaves are almost completely dry, at least to the point that no noticeable drops of water can be spotted dripping off.
You do not need to air dry the cilantro extensively for this method, though. Since you will end up wrapping the herb in damp paper towels later on, it will be exposed to a little moisture, anyway.

, Spread the cilantro out onto a sheet of mildly moist, clean paper towel. Carefully wrap the herb bunch in the paper towel so that all sides are covered.The paper towel should only be a little damp. Do not make the paper towel dripping wet.

, Transfer the wrapped cilantro to a plastic bag or plastic container with an airtight seal. Close the container and label it with the current date and contents.


If placing the cilantro in a plastic bag, close the top seal, leaving only 1 inch (2.5 cm) of open space. Gently squeeze out all the air before you finish sealing the bag.
If placing the cilantro into an airtight container, make sure that the lid snaps on securely and leaves no space for air to slip in or out.

, Store the container of cilantro in your refrigerator for a week or so.


Cilantro is a fairly delicate herb. As such, using this method to store fresh cilantro may not be as effective as other methods. While a damp paper towel and plastic bag work well for hardier herbs, like mint and parsley, cilantro wilts faster. According to the experiences of many home cooks, methods that allow the leaves to remain dry can actually prolong the freshness of the herb longer.
Note, however, that this method is very effective if you only want to keep the cilantro fresh for five days or so. The combination of moisture and cool temperatures can keep the cilantro at optimum freshness and crispness for a few days, but if you need to keep it fresh for a longer period of time, you would be better off with another method.

Determine which type of pepper will be right for making your crushed red pepper flakes.,
Consider how big of a batch you want to make.,
Heat the oven to 170ºF/75ºC or a low setting.,
Using a knife, carefully cut off the pepper stems.,
Line non-greased cookie sheets with peppers.,
Bake in the oven for approximately six hours.,
Crush into flakes.,
Once the dried peppers have been thoroughly crushed, carefully pour them into an airtight container for storage.",How to Make Homemade Crushed Red Pepper Flakes1," With a whole family of peppers you can pick, base your decision on how hot of a pepper you can handle. Pepper hotness is measured by Scoville units--the higher the Scoville unit, the hotter the pepper. For example, a sweet bell pepper has zero Scoville units whereas the mighty Habanero pepper ranges from 100,000 to 350,000. The hottest pepper on the scale is the Trinidad Scorpion Butch at 1,463,700.


Assess your overall needs. If you're creating the crushed pepper for home use and you like them hot, go for the hottest pepper you can find. However, if you're giving the flakes to friends, you may want to go with something a little tamer.






Test the pepper before you make the crushed flake batch. What may be considered to be hot to some may not be to others. Or, you may not like the taste of certain peppers.





;
, In general, 71 Serrano peppers can make one cup of crushed red pepper flakes.

, Although the easiest way is to dry the peppers in the oven, you could also sun dry them, especially if you live in an arid climate.

, Then, slice the peppers by simply splitting them in half. Don't remove the seeds.

, Line the peppers side by side and avoid clumping them together; otherwise, they won’t dry properly.

, To be sure they get enough time to dry, set a timer. Once six hours have passed by, turn off the oven and allow the dried peppers to remain in the oven overnight, so they will continue to dry and dehydrate.

, The next day, place the dried peppers in a food processor or crush them by hand. Only crush peppers by hand if you're wearing gloves and you're crushing the peppers while they're inside a plastic bag. Otherwise, stick with the food processor.

, Serve the crushed peppers in a food shaker such as a pepper shaker."

Layer the cilantro in between layers of dry paper towel.Place a sheet of dry paper towel at the bottom of an airtight plastic container.,
Keep in the refrigerator.",How to Keep Cilantro Fresh2," Cut off any dry tips from the stems of the cilantro in your bunch. You should also remove any old or damaged leaves at this time.


It is also a good idea to cut off the tough stems completely for this method. The stems are not necessary since they will not be drawing in any moisture, and removing them can make it easier to fit the cilantro into a tight container.

, If the cilantro is even a little moist, you should dry it with clean paper towels or by putting it through a spin in a salad spinner.


Cilantro will go bad much faster if the leaves are still wet, so it is crucial that you get as much water off as possible. To be on the safe side, the best option is to spin the cilantro in a salad spinner and spread the stems out in a single layer on a dry kitchen towel. Place the towel in direct sunlight for a few hours to further dry the cilantro.

, Arrange a single layer of cilantro on top of it, then cover the cilantro with another paper towel. Repeat this pattern, alternating back and forth between cilantro and paper towel layers.


If possible, only keep one layer of cilantro in a container. Crowding the container with too much of the herb can actually cause problems.
Regardless of how many layers you have, the bottom and top layers should both be paper towel layers.
Snap the container shut when done. Make sure that the seal is airtight.
Do not use a plastic bag instead of a plastic food storage container for this method.

, Cover the container and place it in your refrigerator. It should stay fresh for two to three weeks.


Check the cilantro periodically during this time. Look through the sides of the container if using clear plastic, or quickly remove the lid and peek inside if using a container made of tinted plastic. Remove any wilted or discolored cilantro. If you notice any moisture, dry the container and send your cilantro for another spin in the salad spinner.

Finished.

",How to Keep Cilantro Fresh3," Cut off any dry or damaged stem ends with a sharp pair of kitchen shears. At this time, you should also inspect the bunch for damaged or wilted leaves. Remove these leaves, as well.


Consider trimming the stems under cool, running water. Doing so causes less shock to the herb, and since the ends will be immersed in water anyway, they can get wet without worry. Keeping the ends as fresh as possible is actually preferred since they will be able to draw up more water that way.

, If the leaves have any noticeable moisture on them, you should dry them off with clean, dry paper towels or by running them through a salad spinner.


Even though the stems will be wet for this method, it is important that the leaves remain dry. The cilantro will wither much quicker if you allow the leaves to remain wet.
Note that for this method, it is better to clean the cilantro before you are ready to use it instead of now, when you are only trying to keep it fresh. Waiting minimizes the amount of water touching the leaves.

, Fill the bottom quarter of a sturdy glass jar with cool water. Arrange the cilantro inside the glass after that, making sure that all the cut stem ends are submerged.The cut ends should be submerged, but the leaves should remain above the surface of the water. If a few leaves dip under the water, either reduce the amount of water in the jar or trim off the bottom leaves.

, Place a resealable plastic bag over the top of the cilantro. Let the opening of the bag remain loose.


Do not secure the bag onto the jar with a rubber band or anything else.
The opening of the bag should fall below the mouth of the glass. In other words, the leafy portion of the cilantro needs to be completely covered with the bag.

, You will need to change the water every few days. Knowing when to change the water is as easy as simply taking a look at the glass. As soon as the water starts to become discolored, it is time to swap it out for a fresher water supply.


Check the condition of the cilantro when you change the water. Snip off any dried ends or wilting leaves before returning the cilantro to the fresh jar of water.

, Store the glass cilantro in your refrigerator. When using this method, cilantro can stay fresh for up to two weeks, if not longer.


The cold temperature is just as important to this method as the water itself, if not more important. If you leave the cilantro out at room temperature, it will only last for a week at most. Cilantro kept in this manner has been known to remain fresh for a little over four weeks when stored in the refrigerator.,"

In some cases, you may be able to remove the dirt and other residue by brushing it away with your fingers. If the bulbs are particularly dirty, you may need to use a soft cloth to clean them.For stubborn dirt that won’t wipe away with fingers or a cloth, try using an old toothbrush to go over the bulbs. Be gentle, though, so you don’t bruise the garlic when you’re cleaning it.
If the garlic is extremely dirty, you may want to remove a couple of the outer layers of dry skin.;
, To ensure that you wind up with a neat, attractive braid, you’ll need to trim the bulbs before you begin braiding. There are usually long, scraggly roots attached to the bulbs, so you’ll want to cut those to approximately ¼-inch. The roots aren’t very thick, so you can use regular scissors to trim the garlic.If you notice that any of the leaves are jagged or scraggy, you may want to trim them as well because they can make it more difficult to braid.

, When you’re braiding, you want the bulbs’ leaves to be pliable so they’re easier to braid. The best way to make them more flexible is to soak them in water. Fill a bowl or sink with lukewarm water, and soak the garlic so just the leaves are submerged. You don’t want the bulbs to get wet. Let the leaves soak for approximately 15 to 30 minutes, or until they feel more pliable.Instead of soaking the leaves, you can sandwich them between two thoroughly wet towels. Once again, make sure the bulbs are not getting wet, and let the leaves sit for 15 to 30 minutes.

, To make an attractive braid, you’ll need approximately 12 bulbs. As you’re sorting the ones that you’ll use, set aside the three largest bulbs to serve as the start of the braid. Lay them on a flat surface with one bulb in the center, one to its left, and one to its right. The center bulb’s leaves should be pointed at you, while the other two’s leaves are criss crossed over one another to form an X over the center bulb.








It helps to secure the place where the bulbs overlap with a piece of twine. Make sure that the piece you use is long enough to knot over the bulbs with enough excess that you can secure additional bulbs that you place in the braid.

, Place a fourth bulb over the existing bundle, so it matches up with the center bulb. Use the excess twine to secure the fourth bulb to the stack to make it easier when you start to braid. Next, take two more bulbs and align them with the two diagonal bulbs in a criss cross fashion.









Take the time to line them up as much as possible because it’ll be easier when it comes time to braid.

, With all of the bulbs’ leaves lined up, it’s time to start the braid. Make sure that you’re grabbing the two sets of leaves for each section as you begin braiding. Take the two leaves from the right side and cross them under the middle leaves, so they become the center pieces. Next, take the two leaves on the left and cross them under the middle leaves. Repeat the process one or two more times.








You may find it easier to secure the braid with more twine before you add more bulbs. Just tie the knot in the back to keep it neat.

, Once you’ve started the braid, you can add three bulbs. You should line the leaves up with the existing ends of the braids as you did with the second set, so one aligns with the left section, one aligns with the center, and one aligns with the right. Start braiding again for one or two passes, and repeat the process until you’ve added all of your bulbs.








It’s a good idea to use twine to secure the bundle of bulbs after you’ve added the last set. That will make it easier to finish off the rest of the braid. To make it more decorative, tie it off in a bow.

, After you’ve added all of the garlic, you should continue braiding the leaves until you get to the end. Use another piece of twine to tie off the end and secure the entire braid. Use a pair of scissors to trim the end of the roots so they’re even and neat -- and you’re ready to hang your garlic braid in your kitchen.








You may also want to make the time to trim the fine roots at the tops of the bulbs to give the braid a neater appearance.

, If you want to preserve your garlic for long-term use, you need to cure it after it’s harvested. The curing process is meant to help the bulbs dry out, so you need to choose the right location to keep them. You want a dry, dark space with good air circulation. A covered porch, carport, barn, or well-ventilated garage can work well.Make sure to keep garlic that you’re curing out of direct sunlight because the heat can start to cook it and change its flavor.

, When you’re ready to cure your garlic, it’s best to divide your harvest into portions. It’s usually best to create bundles of 5 to 10 bulbs, and tie them together with string or twine that's wrapped and knotted around their stalks. You can then hang them or place them on mesh racks for curing, so it’s easier for air to circulate around the bulbs.Don’t remove any leaves or do any trimming when you’re preparing the bundles of garlic. The bulbs still gets energy from the rest of the plant until all of the moisture is gone.

, For the garlic to fully cure, you have to wait until all of the moisture evaporates from the leaves and roots. That can take anywhere from two weeks to a month. If you live in a very humid location, though, it may take longer. You’ll know that the garlic is cured when the roots are shriveled, the leaves turn brown, and the bulbs have developed several layers of papery skin.When you plan to braid your garlic, it’s often easier if you don’t allow it to fully cure. Let it go for about a week, and then braid it when the stems are still flexible.

, The best time to plant garlic is in the fall approximately four to six weeks before the ground freezes in your area. The colder your climate is, the earlier in the fall that you should plant. That means the garlic is usually ready to harvest in early to mid summer, which can be anywhere from July to August. Because garlic grows underground, it can be difficult to know when it’s ready -- the trick is to watch the plants and notice when approximately ⅓ of the leaves are pale yellow and shriveled.Dry soil around the plants is another sign that your garlic is ready to be harvested.
If you aren’t sure whether your garlic is ready to be harvested, remove one or two bulb to examine them. They should be a good size, and the skins should be completely filled.

, If the soil is too tightly compacted around the garlic, it can be difficult to remove them from the ground. Before you try to lift the bulbs free, use a digging fork or small shovel to carefully loosen the dirt around the bulbs of garlic so you’ll be able to easily work them free. Don’t dig too close to the bulbs or you may damage them.Be careful when you’re using the fork or shovel around the bulbs. Garlic is delicate, so it can bruise easily.

, You may be tempted to pull the bulbs out of the ground by their stems, but you can damage the garlic if you extract it too roughly. Instead, use a spade, shovel, or garden fork to gently lift the bulbs out of the dirt. Gently place the harvested bulbs in a container, such as a bucket, to keep them safe as you continue to remove the rest of the garlic.It’s usually best to use a spade or shovel to lift the garlic out of the ground because it’s easier to damage if you use a pointed tool like a garden fork.
Keep the garlic out of the sun after you harvest it. Place the container that’s holding the bulbs in the shade or cover it with a sheet.

Purchase or harvest garlic that is fresh and firm.,
Dry homegrown garlic bulbs before storing.,
Store garlic at room temperature.,
Keep garlic in a location with good air circulation.,
Store fresh garlic bulbs in a dark, dry spot.,
Use garlic quickly once you have broken the bulb.,
Be aware that storage for ""new season garlic"" is different from regular garlic.",How to Store Fresh Garlic1," This is important, as the fresher your garlic, the longer it will last.









The garlic bulb should be firm with papery dry skin and have no sprouting. Soft bulbs indicate over-ripe garlic that will not store for very long.
Avoid shriveled garlic bulbs or those that are stored in the refrigerated section of the grocery store.;
, Drying your homegrown garlic before storing allows the flavor to develop and become more concentrated.








Wash your recently harvested garlic bulb and allow it to dry in a dark, but moisture-free, place for about a week.
You can hang garlic from its stalks to dry.

, Many people make the mistake of storing garlic in the refrigerator, but garlic actually does best at a cool room temperature of around 60 °F (16 °C).








Refrigerating garlic is a bad idea as it causes the bulb to deteriorate. Refrigerating garlic bulbs adds moisture and can cause the bulb to grow moldy.
If you have chopped or minced fresh garlic, you can store it in the refrigerator in a sealed container for a short period, but use it as soon as possible.
Freezing is not recommended, because it changes the consistency and flavor of the garlic.

, Storing your garlic bulbs in a well-ventilated spot allows the garlic to ""breathe"" and will extend its shelf-life.








Garlic bulbs can be kept in a mesh or wire basket, a small bowl with ventilation holes or even a paper bag.
Do not store fresh garlic bulbs in plastic bags or sealed containers. This can cause mold and sprouting.

, Your kitchen cupboard or a shady corner of your kitchen counter top is perfect for this.









Keep your garlic away from sunlight and moisture to avoid sprouting.

, The shelf life of your garlic is shortened significantly when you break up the bulb to remove the cloves.









If the garlic begins to feel soft, or the cloves have green sprouts through the middle, then it is time to throw the garlic away.
Unbroken garlic bulbs can be kept up to 8 weeks if stored properly. Cloves broken from the garlic bulb will keep from 3-to-10 days.

, Homegrown, new season garlic will need to be refrigerated directly upon harvesting.









Also called ""young wet"" garlic, these garlic bulbs are harvested in early summer and have a mild flavor. They do not need to be dried and can be refrigerated for up to a week.
New season garlic has a milder flavor than regular garlic and can be used in place of onions and leeks in cooking.

Make the mixture thinner with more oil.,
Season the pesto.",How to Eat Wild Garlic2," Set the oven to 350 F (180 C). This only has to be done if you wish to toast your nuts. The nuts can also be used raw or left out entirely.

, Place about 4/10 cup (50 g) of pine nuts in an oven dish or on a baking tray. Let the nuts sit inside the oven for about five minutes. Remember to check, since the nuts can quickly burn. Take them out when finished.


Walnuts or other nuts can be used instead., Combine about 3.5 oz (100 g) of chopped garlic leaves, 4/10 cup (50 g) of parmesan cheese, a tablespoon or two of olive oil, and the nuts inside a blender. Use the pulse or blitz setting to make the pesto as smooth as you’d like.Walnut oil or canola oil can also be substituted for the olive oil., Pouring more oil into the mixture will change the pesto’s consistency. Thinner pesto can be made by adding more oil and blending the mixture further. Slowly add the oil and mix the ingredients until you get the consistency you desire., Add a squeeze of lemon juice to the pesto. Include some lemon zest if you have any on hand. Also try adding half a teaspoon of salt and black pepper to give the sauce more flavor.Use the pesto on pasta or other food as a sauce.
The pesto will last up to a week in the refrigerator and up to four months in the freezer.

, You may use any six chicken pieces that you have, including breasts, thighs, and drumsticks. If you have a whole chicken, separate it into six pieces. Lay these on a baking tray.

, Cut a lemon into six slices. Squeeze a lemon slice over each piece of chicken. Afterwards, place each slice under a chicken piece to add more flavoring.

, You can peel the ginger first by using a spoon or paring knife to get under the skin. Hold the ginger still and scrape off the skin. Dice about two inches (5 cm) of fresh ginger. Add the tiny ginger pieces over and beside the chicken., Obtain two onions. Chop each one into at least three wedges. Set the onion wedges next to the chicken.

, Gather a cup (240 mL) of garlic leaves. Rip them apart by hand and scatter them over and around the chicken.

, Drizzle three tablespoons of olive oil over all the chicken pieces. Follow this by sprinkling a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, a teaspoon of sea salt, and as much black pepper as you’d like.

, Measure out 25 oz (150 mL) of white or pink wine. Add it to the tray and spread it out over the bottom of the tray under the chicken and other ingredients.

, Allow the chicken to begin to cook for about ten minutes. Once the time is up, remove the chicken from the oven., Spread the wine at the bottom of the pan over the chicken with a brush, baster, or spoon. Return the chicken to the oven.

, Turn the heat down to 160 F (71 C). Let the chicken cook. After 15 minutes, the skin should look brown on the ends. If the skin has not browned, you can turn the heat back up to 190 F (88 C) and cook for another three or five minutes. Serve the ingredients together on plates.


Cooked chicken will last in the refrigerator up to four days.

Harvest wild garlic in spring.,
Wash the leaves in water before use.,
Use wild garlic bulbs as a substitute for store-bought garlic.,
Use the flowers as seasoning.",How to Eat Wild Garlic4," Wild garlic can be found throughout all of spring. However, in early spring, the flowers have not yet bloomed. Once the flowers bloom in the middle of spring, they start losing flavor., Cut off any parts of the plant you wish to use, including the flowers and seeds. The bulbs are usually too small to use and taking them means the plant won’t grow back. Run the cuttings under cold water, then pat them dry with a cloth., The bulbs serve the same function as standard garlic bulbs. Peel them and chop them up to use as seasoning in any dish that calls for garlic flavoring.

, The flowers and their seed pods can be eaten raw. Add them to savory dishes, such as salads, where they’ll be an edible garnish. They will give you the same flavor as the garlic plant’s leaves."

Freeze garlic.,
Store garlic in oil.,
Store garlic in wine or vinegar.,
Dry garlic.,
Make garlic salt.",How to Store Fresh Garlic2," Although some people are opposed to freezing garlic, as it is said to change the texture and flavor, freezing can be a good option for those who use garlic infrequently or for people with leftover cloves that they don't want to go to waste. You can freeze garlic in one of two ways:

You can freeze whole, unpeeled garlic cloves by wrapping them in plastic wrap or aluminum foil, or popping them in a freezer bag, and placing in the freezer. You can then remove individual cloves as needed.Alternatively, you can peel the garlic cloves, crush or chop them finely and place the garlic in a plastic freezer bag or wrap it in some plastic freezer wrap. If the garlic becomes stuck together when frozen, you can grate off as much of the frozen garlic as needed., There has been some controversy about storing garlic in oil, as keeping garlic-infused oil at room temperature has been associated with the growth of the bacteria clostridium botulinum which can cause a fatal illness known as botulism. However, if the garlic oil is stored in the freezer, the risk of it developing this bacteria are removed.To safely store garlic in oil:









You can peel individual garlic cloves and completely submerge them in oil in a glass jar or plastic container. Tightly seal the jar or container with a lid and place directly into the freezer. Use a spoon to scoop out the garlic as needed.Alternatively, you can make a puree of garlic and olive oil by mixing one part peeled garlic cloves with two parts olive oil in a blender or food processor. Transfer the puree to a freezer-safe container with a tight-fitting lid and place in the freezer. This method is very convenient for cooks, as the oil prevents the puree from freezing so it can be scooped out and placed directly on a pan., Peeled garlic cloves can be pickled in wine or vinegar and stored in the refrigerator for up to four months. You can use a dry red or white wine, or a white or white wine vinegar. To store garlic in this way, fill a glass jar with peeled garlic cloves, then pour in your chosen wine or vinegar to fill up the available space. Seal the jar tightly and place in the refrigerator.








To add extra flavor to your pickled garlic, you may add a tablespoon of salt (per cup of liquid) along with any dried herbs, such as red pepper flakes, oregano, rosemary or bay leaves. Shake the jar well to mix the contents.Although the pickled garlic should last in the refrigerator for up to four months, you should discard the contents of the jar if you see any signs of mold forming on the surface of the liquid. Never store the pickled garlic at room temperature, as mold will form very quickly., Another easy way to preserve your garlic is to dry it out. Dried garlic will condense, so a even a large amount of garlic will take up very little space in your pantry. When used in cooking, the dried garlic will absorb water and give great flavor to your dish. There are two ways to dry garlic, depending on whether you have a food dehydrator or not.

You can dry garlic in a food dehydrator by peeling the cloves and cutting them in half lengthwise. You should only use plump, unbruised cloves for dehydrating. Place them on the tray of your dehydrator and follow the manufacturers instructions for best heat settings. The garlic is completely dried when it becomes crisp and brittle.If you don not have a food dehydrator, you can use the same process, using the oven instead. Place the halved garlic cloves on a baking dish and bake at 140 °F (60 °C) for two hours. Then turn the heat down to 130 and continue to bake until the garlic is fully dried.., You can use your dried garlic to make garlic salt, which is adds a great, subtle garlic flavor to dishes when cooking. To make the garlic salt, simply blend the dried garlic in a food processor until it forms a fine powder. Add in four parts of sea salt for every one part of garlic and process for minute or two to combine.








Don't process the sea salt and garlic powder for any longer than two minutes or it will clump together.
Store the garlic salt in a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid and keep in a cool, dark kitchen cupboard.

Free the individual cloves from the bulb.,
Peel the cloves.,
Slice the entire garlic clove lengthwise.,
Slice the clove crosswise.,
If desired, keep mincing.",How to Mince Garlic1," You can't mince garlic until you prepare the cloves for use. Start by using the palm of your hand to press down firmly on the bulb. The individual cloves will separate from each other as gentle pressure is applied.


The loose outer skin, which has a brittle papery appearance and texture, can be pulled off and discarded to get to the cloves. Take care not to discard small cloves of garlic that may be hidden within the peel.Most recipes will indicate the number of cloves, or bulbs, required. If not, one medium-sized clove usually gives about one tablespoon of minced garlic.;
, The tight, transparent skin around each clove needs to be removed prior to its use in cooking. There are a few different ways to do this. See below:









One way is to cut off the hard stem end of the clove (where it attached to the garlic bulb) and squeeze the clove out from its skin using gentle, but steady, pressure.
Another is to place the side of the knife blade on top of the clove and press down firmly until you feel the skin release. Peel the skin off with your fingers. Take care not to smash the clove completely, which may cause the clove ""meat"" to mix with the waste.

, The thinner the slices, the better. A sharp knife will help greatly here, but since garlic cloves are so small, extra care must be taken to avoid cutting yourself. See below:









One trick chefs use to prevent cutting accidents is to hold the thing they are cutting (in this case a clove of garlic) with their fingertips, putting a bend in their knuckles as they press it into the cutting board. This way, the side of the knife rests against the knuckle, leaving a gap between it and the tips of the fingers, making an accident less likely.
To get better control over the knife, hold it against the board and use a rocking motion to slice the garlic, rather than moving it up and down., Turn the clove 90 degrees and slice it once more. Here, again, thin cuts across the layers will produce a finer mince. Use the same slicing technique as before.









When finished, you should be left with dozens (or even hundreds) of tiny garlic cubes. Congratulations — you've just minced a clove of garlic.

, The more you mince a clove of garlic, the more tiny pieces you'll get, which will give you greater flavor and aroma. If the recipe calls for it, keep running your knife back and forth over the pile of minced garlic to achieve a finer cut, or to eliminate any large pieces that may remain.









As a reminder, finely minced garlic is garlic that's been minced a lot into many tiny pieces. Coarsely minced garlic is garlic that's been minced into just a few big pieces.

Prepare and peel the cloves as normal.,
Try mincing with a fork.,
Try using a garlic press.,
Try micro-planning.,
Alternatively, use a food processor.",How to Mince Garlic2," In this section, you'll learn a few alternative ways to mince garlic if you don't have a knife handy. For each of these, you'll want to prep the garlic cloves as normal before you start mincing. In other words:


Separate the correct number of cloves from the bulb.
Discard leftover bulb skin.
Peel the garlic by squeezing each clove out of the skin or crushing it with a knife and peeling the skin off.

, One easy way to mince garlic is with the tines of a fork. This requires a little arm strength but works surprisingly well. To do this:








Lay the garlic flat on a cutting board and grab a sturdy metal fork.
Press the bottoms of the tines of the fork into the garlic. Press down hard to push the garlic through the gaps in the tines.
Turn the fork and repeat in the other direction. Continue repeating for a final mince.
Wipe the scraps off of the fork and pick the stem nub out of the minced garlic. It's now ready to use.

, Another handy tool you can use to prepare garlic is called a garlic press. This device does what its name suggests: presses garlic into a crushed-up paste. To use a garlic press:








Place the clove inside the inner metal part of the press.
Squeeze the handles. The garlic will be forced through the holes on the other side of the press.
Scrape the scraps out and combine with the garlic material that was forced through the press. The garlic is now ready to use.
Another device that works similarly is the mortar and pestle.

, A microplane is a small device that looks (and works) like an extra-fine cheese grater. Microplaning a clove of garlic slices it into razor-thin slices fairly quickly.









To use a microplane, just rub the garlic against the blades over a bowl. The thin, wet slices will fall through the microplane into the bowl.
When the garlic gets too small to microplane without hurting your fingers, just chop it up or crush it and combine with the rest.

, It's worth noting that almost any food processor device should be able to mince garlic as well. Pulsing the blades just a few times should be enough to achieve a good mince. Since garlic cloves are so small, it can be a pain to assemble a food processor just to mince one, but this is a good choice if you need to mince many for a larger recipe.

Use a knife to scrape off and out obvious garlic that is stuck on either side of the mincer.,
Cut a small piece of potato.,
Push the potato through the mincer.,
Wash in the dish washing water as usual.",How to Easily Clean a Garlic Press2," Do this over the sink, using running water if wished.

, It must be small enough to fit inside the mincer, the same size as a garlic clove. If you're using potatoes in your cooking for the same meal, set aside a little piece from those potatoes.

, It will come out easily through the other side and will bring with it the rest of the stuck garlic. Best of all it removes the odor of crushed garlic.


A small piece of bread can be substituted for the potato and will work just as effectively. It's a good use of discarded crusts!

, Allow to air dry; this is more effective than trying to towel dry it.

Remove the root.,
Place the garlic clove on a cutting board.,
Place the flat side of a broad knife over the garlic clove.,
Use your hand to press the flat side of the knife against the clove.,
Peel the skin.,
Prepare the garlic for cooking.",How to Crush Garlic1," Place the garlic clove on a cutting board and use a knife to trim off the tip of the root.









Do not cut away too much, or else you will lose good, usable garlic. Only remove the tip.
Removing the root end will make it easier to remove the skin later on.;
, Make sure that it is near the edge of the board, on the side that is nearest to you.

, Make sure the blade is facing away from your hand.








, The clove will easily crush under your weight. Use a rocking motion to crush it thoroughly.


The sharp blade should face out and away from the hand used to strike the knife. If holding the knife with your right hand, the blade should face right. If holding the knife with your left hand, the blade should face left.

, The skin of the broken clove should be loosened and easy to peel away with your fingers.








, You may crush it further, chop it, or mince it. To make a paste, strike it with the broad side of your knife until a paste forms.








You should remove the exposed green shoots in the middle of the garlic clove. These shoots can be plucked out with your fingers. It is recommended that you remove them because they can taste bitter.

Don't be afraid to ask for help.,
Familiarize yourself with your college.,
If you live in the dorms familiarize yourself with people in your hallway or building.,
Be respectful.,
Sign up for enrichment courses (AKA extra curricular activities).",How to Deal With Your First Week of College," Make sure that you know what you have, when you have it, and where you have it. Most colleges offer maps to students who need to know their way around. Alternatively, never be afraid to ask anyone for directions to your classroom. if you are new to that campus take a tour you might be amazed at what you find.;
, One of the more embarrassing things that can happen to you during college is winding up at your lesson without the appropriate equipment. When checking your timetable, make sure you have all the things you need for that lesson (for example, if you have photography, make sure you have packed your camera, photo paper, etc). it is always a good idea to try to have all your textbook for each class with you on the first day of school, however most professors are nice enough the first 2 weeks and will give you the necessary book.

, Being late is usually more or less expected and accepted during the first week of college, but it's best to try your hardest at punctuality to avoid further problems. Check out your route to college an hour or so before you leave the house, and make sure you have allowed yourself enough time for travel. Check bus or train times online, to make sure that there are no cancellations or delays, and always have an alternative route in the event of a problem.

, If you don't know many, or any people at your college, take a book along with you for breaks in between lessons. It gives you something to do, and means that you don't have to wander aimlessly waiting for your lesson to start.

, Most colleges allow a level of communication between students in the classroom. Try to start a conversation with the person next to you. You could comment on the piece of work they are doing, or ask for help or advice. If you recognize anyone in one class from another of your classes, ask them for the room or time of your next lesson. (e.x. ""Excuse me, we have photography together don't we? What room are we in for the lesson at 2.40?) who knows you might miss a class and need someone to borrow their notes.

, If you have any problems whatsoever, there are plenty of people at college to help you. Never be afraid to ask for help.

, On your breaks, wander around the college, and take a look at your map in regards to where you are. Make a mental note of where things are, and consult your map or ask for directions if you get lost. Do this a few times and you should become reasonably familiar with the environment.

, These people are the ones you are going to be seeing the most.

, Be respectful to other students and to members of staff. Be polite, punctual, and friendly, and you will gain a good reputation around the college.

, Getting on-board with extra activities can really help you settle into college, as well as meet new people with a similar interest to you (for example, taking Japanese language lessons, you can meet people who share an interest in Japanese culture). It also shows that you have a keen interest in furthering yourself and your education.

Press the clove with the heel of your hand. Applying a small amount of pressure to the garlic clove is enough to loosen the skin. Place the heel of your hand over the garlic clove and press down firmly until you feel the skin start to shift. Lift your hand and peel the skin off with your fingers.
As described above, another way to loosen the skin is to press the garlic clove with the flat side of a broad knife. Position the side of the knife over the clove with the sharp blade away from your hand. Press firmly or pound slightly against the knife. You do not need to press hard, since you only want to loosen the skin instead of crushing the clove.
You could also use a garlic peeler. This is a rubberized tool specifically designed to help you peel garlic. Place the garlic clove inside the tube and press down on the tube with the heel of your hand. Roll the tube back and forth until you hear a ""crunching"" sound. Tilt the tube slightly so that the garlic clove topples out. The skin should already be removed.
Another way to peel garlic is to microwave the garlic clove.Place the clove in the microwave and cook for 5 to 10 seconds. The garlic clove will slide out of its skin. You can even peel entire heads or bulbs of garlic this way by putting them in for 15 to 20 seconds. Be aware, however, that this method could make the taste of the garlic slightly less pungent.

, Place the garlic inside the basket area of the press.









The type of garlic press you use can have an effect on how well the process works. A higher quality press has nubs on it that make clearing garlic out of the holes easier, and you might be able to get more garlic out of each clove as a result. Even a lower quality press will usually be enough to crush the garlic sufficiently, though.

, Press the two handles together, applying as much pressure as you can.









Depending on the quality and weight of your press, you may need to exert considerable force. A garlic press made from a heavier material will usually be easier to press together than one made of a light, flimsy material.
The garlic that comes through the other side of the press will be crushed.

Find a smooth stone.,
Clean the stone.,
Wrap the garlic in wax paper.,
Smack the garlic clove with the stone.,
Remove the skin.,
Continue crushing the garlic with the stone.",How to Crush Garlic3," The stone should be roughly the same size as the palm of your hand.


In principle, this works similar to the method of using a kitchen knife. The advantage is that you do not have to use a utensil with a sharp blade, and you can use this method when camping or backpacking.
A smooth rock works much better than one with a jagged surface. The more even the surface is, the more evenly the garlic will be crushed.

, Run it through the dishwasher two or three times to make sure that it is thoroughly clean.









If you do not have a dishwasher or do not feel comfortable throwing stones in it, you can clean the rock by washing it in a solution of hot water, soap, and a small amount of bleach. Rinse well and dry well.

, Fold a small sheet of wax paper around the top and bottom of the garlic clove.









This step is only optional, technically speaking, but it does help in keeping the process sanitary since the wax paper prevents the rock from coming into direct contact with the garlic. It also makes it easier to collect the crushed garlic afterward.

, Give the garlic clove a good smack with the stone, just enough to loosen the skin.









Be careful as you do this so that you do not accidentally crush your fingers.

, The skin should peel away easily after the first strike.








, You can crush the garlic further by continuing to strike it or by grinding it.









Crush the garlic by striking it multiple times with the stone.
Place the stone over the garlic clove and ""wiggle"" it back and forth, applying strong, even pressure.

, If you have a special interest in the class, need it as a prerequisite, or need it to graduate, professors may be sympathetic.

, If the professor comes early too, this will give you a chance to introduce yourself. The professor may also be able to tell you your chances of getting in. If the professor won't be able to add you, this saves you time and gives you a chance to crash or attend other classes.

, If the professor asks a question or asks for volunteers, don't hesitate to make yourself known.

, Shake hands and introduce yourself, and be sure to reiterate your interest in the class and your reasons for taking it. Ask if it would be okay to attend a few class meetings to see if a spot opens up.

,, Some professors may even offer to grade your homework and exams. You may be able to list the class on your transcript or test out of it in the future.

, If the issue is simply having enough units, be adventurous and look at courses you wouldn't normally take, such as dance, psychology, philosophy, or communications.

Ask whoever is at reception or the front office to give you information on your course or to help you work out how to move you into your new home (if you've opted to move into halls of residences).,
Take some time to make your room look nice.,
Take some time out to get to know the campus.,
Check out the surrounding area.,
Finish moving in, kick back and relax in your room.,

Keep yourself in shape - even just opting to walk up those two flights of steps instead of taking the lift is better than nothing!,
Maintain your mental health.,
Make sure you don't miss the classes.,
Do your assignments.,
Find friends and develop your social life.,
Make sure you keep some money back for emergencies, and budget.,
Know your limits with respect to alcohol.",How to Cope with University Life," Also ask about what events are happening and what's on offer. There is often a whole load of parties happening at the start of each year/semester (often known as 'freshers' or 're-freshers' week), so see if you can get any information about those as they're a great way to get to know people attending the same university as you!


When you arrive at university, you'll probably have been informed by where to go by an email from those responsible for informing new students. If not, your best bet is to find reception, or the main entrance. This is helpful, as they always have lots of good advice on posters, pamphlets - and there will always be people around who will be open to your questions.;
, Having a room that feels like home can sometimes be all the difference. Put up pictures, hang decorations, put a nice fluffy blanket on your bed - the comfier you feel, the better! Not only will it make you feel good, if you have a nice looking room anyone whom you're sharing your halls with might want to hang out in there - and there you go––friends!

, It's important to know where things are, such as where to go if there's a fire drill or where you can grab a coffee with your friend. Having more knowledge of your area will make it easier to cope, as you'll feel more acquainted with your surroundings.


It's also important to note where things like security staff are based, where residential support is, maybe even start scouting which buildings your classes are or are likely to be in.
Have a look at the social areas for places like bars, cafes, and so forth, where you can meet new people if need be. If there are any food shops onsite, make sure you take into account where they are, how much food is, and other relevant information.

, It's very important to know where local amenities are located, such as doctor's surgery, pharmacy, laundromat and places like that––you're going to need these services to help you to live a comfortable life. Knowing about what's available can make all the difference.


If you're on a tight budget at university, have a look for some food shops and the like and compare prices––it's important that you know how to get the best value for your money!

, Or, if you're feeling brave, go out and start meeting people!

, When it comes to surviving in a new place by yourself where you don't have any adults around to make sure that you don't come down with scurvy or something else dreadful, make sure you look after your physical health.

, This is advised, but let's face it - you're at university now. Part of the whole student trope is dragging yourself to your 9ams after being out till 2 in the morning the night before painting the town red. Either way, you will need to sleep sometimes - and make sure that you do when you get the chance as nobody wants to have anything to do with someone who looks like a zombie! (Unless you're into that sort of thing, of course).

, Even those dodgy canned vegetables are better than nothing. Drink plenty of water and fruit juice (preferably without vodka or some other kind of spirit that you only drink if you're that desperate to get drunk). Try to vary what you eat.


Often, the more colourful your plate looks with different foods, the better. And this shouldn't be too hard––everyone knows that students tend to be attracted to all things colourful and shiny.

,


If you're showing some rather dodgy signs that suggest your health is on the decline, be sure to go to the doctor's.
If you're coughing up mucus or you ate something dodgy, it's much better to get yourself looked at than waiting for things to get worse, then having to miss multiple classes to get better! Physical health is very important; if your body feels okay, often this means your mind and your mood will be much better too!

, Loads and loads of students can struggle with anxiety, depression, and other similar things when they leave home for the first time. There should be a counselling and advice section at your university - and it's well worth paying a visit to them if you feel down all the time or things aren't starting to get better any time soon. Similarly, if you're stressed about exams or assignments or anything like that, counselling services can help you manage that stress and help you make the best use of your time. 


If you're struggling with ongoing mental problems, make sure you get signed up to the mental health service at your university. You won't be singled out or anything like that––it just means that staff can keep an eye on you if you suddenly take a downturn.
If you need any kind of help, it often means that it can save you having to explain your situation as most people will be aware anyway.

, They're a pain to catch up on, and if you don't feel like going now, you almost certainly won't feel like going later. Go on. Get out of bed and go. If there's anything you don't understand in class, communication is the key––don't let the anxiety eat you alive.


Email your teachers or lecturers and ask him/her to clarify something if you didn't understand it. Chances are, you're not that far behind from understanding, you just need it explained in a few more basic terms.

, Yes, everyone is already aware of how much you hate that era of history that your assignment revolves around. Complaining isn't getting it done though, is it?


However, if you're really, really struggling to motivate yourself or you genuinely feel like you're not going to be able to get it done in time, email your teacher or seminar leader to let them know. Explain the situation and if they feel your excuse is good enough, they'll give you an extension.
If motivation or procrastination become a big problem, it might be worth going to the campus counsellor and explaining what you're struggling with. They'll most likely have some good tips on how to motivate yourself.

, It's actually a lot harder to make friends at uni than most people tell you it is. You might go out clubbing every night but that doesn't necessarily mean that people you meet there want to hang out with you. The same goes for the people in your halls of residence––you might see them in their pyjamas staring at the murky liquid known to all as coffee through half-closed eyes but that doesn't make you an automatic friend. Your best bet to make friends is just to continue being nice to everyone.


It might take days or weeks to find people that you really, really gel with. You might be lonely for a while––some people don't even start making solid friendships until the second semester! But what matters is that the people who are worth your time will find you eventually.
People who are likely to get on naturally gravitate towards each other, you'll see. Join societies, keep getting involved with events and other things, and you'll find that over time (and it might be a bit longer than you'd thought), people will realise you're the bee's knees and come to hang out with you.

, It's no fun having to live off microwavable rice for the last two months of term because you blew your entire student loan on alcohol in the first few weeks. Trust this advice!

, While this may seem trivial, it is actually serious. There's nothing worse than waking up the next morning next to someone you don't know or finding out you've had your wallet stolen and you have no idea how to retrace your steps to find out where you lost it. More than that, you won't impress anyone if you throw up on the middle of the dance floor at the nearby club. Honestly, knowing your limits will do you so many favours.

, The internet, newspapers, television and people around you are the best sources of information. Check online about the courses you are interested in and find out about the career prospects and the other info. Speak to people who are in your interested profession and find out what it is to choose your future career. People who have completed university courses can give you an insight from a student’s perspective - they can tell you the pros and cons.

, To avoid making mistakes, make sure you review the course outline of the course(s) you want to apply for. Have a look at the subjects you must undertake and the types of learning, assignments and examination tasks involved. This will enable you to form a rough idea of what lies ahead for you.

, If you are set on going to a particular university, don’t let this completely dictate your course selection. Compare course outlines and studying facilities between universities to make sure you make the right choice for your educational needs and preferences. If possible, visit the university and attend some of the lectures to get a feeling of what some of the subjects will be like.

, To be certain that you will be committed to your studies, find out the duration of your course. Taking double-degrees, full time or part-time depends on your personal choice. Ensure that you will be able to balance your other priorities along with education. Study flexibility varies amongst universities.

, It is more difficult to get accepted in to competitive courses, especially those which are in high demand. This is a good measure of whether you are actually capable of doing well in the course or not. Unfortunately, some courses are too hard to get in to, or just too hard to actually succeed in completing, so be honest with your course selection. You should research other universities or similar courses if you are not confident in being accepted into your first preference course.

, Affordability is another aspect you need to consider while deciding on your course, as well as the additional costs that occur, such as text books, field trips etc. However, do not let cost hamper your career choice, as there are a number of financial assistance options available to complete the course.

, Look at the career prospects of the course before selecting one. Consider various factors such as income, job security, stress, responsibility and other benefits while researching a profession. It is also useful to find out if a future employer will invest in your education.

One of the best ways to cope with academic failure is finding classes that you’d really love to take. If you can feel jazzed about resuming your studies, even if the subject material might be different from what you studied last year, it’ll be easier to move on from previous struggles.;
, Think about what aspects of your classes gave you the most trouble in the previous year. Was is the format of the test? Did you have to write difficult papers? Once you identify what challenged you, seek advice from a professor or teaching assistant. Ask if they have recommendations or strategies for how to succeed in areas that you find particularly daunting. f>http://www.academictips.org/acad/first_y_i_c/learnfromfailure.html</ref>


Take notes during your meeting and decide on a realistic course of action. Ask professors for additional resources that you can engage with over the summer in order to better prepare for success during the next school year.

, The transition to university life is hugely disruptive and can cause many students to feel lonely and overwhelmed during their first year. For many students, failure in the first year is not a reflection of academic ability, but a symptom of an underlying emotional or psychological issue. Recognize that it is 100% normal to need time to adjust to the social, emotional, and mental hurdles of college. Even if you feel emotionally sound, talking with a counselor about ways to achieve academic success can help keep you on track.


Always be aware that there are groups and organizations to support students through academic and emotional struggles. If you were unable to achieve the success you wanted during your first year, talk to a trusted loved one about seeking some additional support through a mental health professional. "

Your advisor will be able to tell you what classes you need to repeat, or recommend classes that might interest you and help to bring up your GPA.

, Now that you have lined up your courses and are moving back to recovering from the failure, make a serious plan to help you stay on track and succeed the second time around. Make sure you give yourself enough time to study and complete assignments on a daily basis.


It helps to figure out when you’re most productive. Many people work best in the mornings. Choose a time during the day to get your most demanding tasks done and stick to a routine schedule.
Take clear notes in class and during readings to make it easier to study for exams or organize papers later on.
Study with a friend. Finding somebody to keep you motivated and on task can help with your academic performance. Enlist friends to quiz you on material, and don’t be afraid to collaborate with peers whose work you respect.

, Universities are full of resources to ensure student success. The first step is being sure to attend all lectures, labs and tutorials available. Don’t squander an opportunity to learn and grow!


Join a study group. Studying with others helps keep you accountable, and makes learning a social and fun activity. Inquire into individual tutoring or assistance available on campus. One on one learning is a great way to go over tougher subject matter that might not get addressed during class time.

, While it’s important to dedicate yourself to your studies, everybody needs time to relax and have fun. Picking up a personal calendar to keep track of your upcoming dates and deadlines is a great way to help you be efficient so that you can enjoy your spare time worry free. Find extracurriculars that interest you. Making time to engage in activities that you’re passionate about will make it easier for you to de-stress and focus on work when necessary.
Make time for important relationships. Don’t force yourself to live in the library 24/7. Hang out with friends for a much needed break. College is also about growing socially, so it’s important to let yourself meet new people and create meaningful relationships.

, This is easiest to do if you love what you’re studying. Choose something you’re passionate about and approach the material with a curious and creative mind. Don’t try to simply memorize or cram for the test. Not only is this a poor method of information retention, but it makes the material seem mundane.


Complete readings on time, talk to peers and professors about concepts that interest you, and take the initiative to research ways to become involved in internships or volunteer opportunities in fields you might want to pursue.

Be confident in who you are and your choices.",How to Cope if You Fail Your First Year at University3," Don’t be afraid to involve the people you care about in your goals and plans. Be open and honest about the proposed path forward, or simply let those around you know what factors in your life have diverted you from your studies. Keeping these emotional and mental problems bottled up makes them feel unmanageable, and talking to others about some of your issues will show you that you’re not the only one struggling.If you don’t feel as if you can discuss your issues with loved ones, set up an appointment with a counselor. Almost all universities offer free mental health services to their students.

, Making a connection with a mentor that you respect can help you feel less isolated, and also hold you accountable for your studies. Don’t worry about being a nuisance – it’s part of your advisor’s job to guide you through the process of picking a suitable program and navigating through to success. Ask their advice on your plan and have them look over your calendar.

, The more you procrastinate, the more daunting your workload will seem. Stick to your study plan and be sure to complete tasks on time so that you can move on to the next one worry free.


Seek help from your college writing center or go your professor’s office hours if you’re worried about completing a specific assignment. Getting help from experts will make the work seem less frightening and more doable.

, Keeping fit and eating healthy foods promotes good brain activity. The Freshman-15lbs is typically caused by a high calorie diet and lack of exercise, making you sluggish and tired. Join a club sport, take a fitness class, get plenty of sleep and fresh foods.


Make plans with a friend to go to a fitness class followed by a healthy meal. A workout buddy will help hold you accountable and make healthy choices more fun. , Though it’s healthy and normal to explore different social opportunities in college, becoming involved in campus-drinking culture or drug use can lead to negative personal and professional impacts.


Do not participate in binge drinking. When you’re of age, having a few casual drinks with friends or going to a party is a great way to socialize and release stress. Binge drinking, on the other hand, is an unhealthy practice that can lead to depression and lack of motivation.
Choose your friends carefully. Surround yourself with people who share your lifestyle choices. Don’t let yourself be peer pressured into illicit activities that hinder your academic and emotional potential. , College is a time for self-exploration and preparing to create a meaningful life for yourself. In addition to your academics, take some time to reflect on who you are, your guiding principles, and what you hope to achieve in the world. Be yourself, and don’t let anybody else dictate who you are or who you think you should become. You are enough just as you are.

Do not be too casual in your communication.,
Do not be afraid to build a rapport with the professors or admin staff that you communicate with, but keep your casual attitude on a tight leash.,
It shouldn’t have to be said, but here it is, you should not use text-talk on any of your written communications, and slang of any sort should be avoided unless the people you are communicating with use it first.

,
Learn the names of the people you are communicating with.,
Check the website and any printed paraphernalia to get all the information you think you need for your written and phone conversations.,
Address your written messages to a named person unless seriously cannot, in which case address them to the department they are heading for.,
Practice your phone conversation before making the call if you are at all nervous.,
If they want all enquiries via email then send an email.,
Give them more than one way of getting back in touch with you.,
If you turn up for an interview then tone down the perfume or aftershave, and light makeup is sufficient.,
Read the literature they give you because there is nothing worse than asking staff members questions that are answered in the college prospectus.,
Spell-check your written communications but read it through for typos too as they will not appear on your spell check.",How to Correspond with a College," This is from every conceivable angle, meaning that if you are on the phone you should not have music in the background or keep telling the admin staff to hold on a minute. It means your written and verbal communication should be cordial and even friendly whilst maintaining an air of professionalism. It also means phoning, emailing, submitting and/or visiting within their schedule and not casually turning up five minutes late without so much as a plausible excuse or apology.;
, This also means picking suitable language and not calling the staff “buddy”, “pal” or any other colloquial term of endearment. Once again, a friendly rapport is okay, in fact it is advised, but be careful how you comment, how you use your language and be extra careful if you are cracking any jokes. Sarcasm is even harder to get away with and requires such skill that it is best avoided.

,, If they call you by your last name then call them by theirs. If you speak in person then a friendly smile goes a lot further than a stern and serious look. The situation is a serious one, but you are dealing with human beings and you have not entered a criminal court.

, This is especially important when meeting people in person. Saying something such as, “I was told I should bring along my portfolio by the arts and technology teacher Mr.…erm, what’s his name?” The admin staff and professors will cordially brush off your faux pas but it will stick in their mind when they think of you next time.

, Remember that you are judging their college as much as they are judging you, which means you should be asking questions too, just make sure they are suitable questions. Asking what time the bars close or how many hot women attend the college is not going to go down well.

, Just rehearse your opening once or twice with a phone in your hand just so you know you will not fumble the first bit. The rest of the conversation should flow very well if you get off to a good start.

, A hand written card through the post may have made an impact in the 1950s but it is going to do you no favors these days. Fill out every form in full and miss out “nothing.” There is nothing more infuriating in both the academic world and the business world to have to receive applications that are not fully filled out.

, Email, a landline, your mobile, and your address are pretty standard things to add in. Adding details such as your fax number or beeper number may send the wrong impression these days. If you have a particularly well written and professional social media profile then you can take the risk and add in (for example), your Facebook ID or Twitter handle. Some admin staff enjoy putting a face to the applications they receive.

, You do not need to look as if you work behind a L’Oreal counter in the mall. Shiny shoes and a suit is not needed as you do not have to look as if you are about to accept an academy award. Use your own style but let it be seen that you have made an effort.

, Also, make sure you address your questions, comments and other non-requested communication to the lowest office that can handle the question. Emailing the Dean to ask about tuition fees is going to be a mistake.

, For example, some colleges get a lot of applications from people describing themselves as an avid leaner, to the point where admin staff start to worry if they have a subsidence problem, especially when they have people saying they think they can lean a lot from their collage.

Be aware of high-traffic hours.,
Research your school’s parking policy.,
Check your resources.,
Talk to your professors.,
Pack the essentials.",How to Commute to College by Car1," When signing up for your courses each term, be sure to choose times that fit into your routine and preferences. If you are not a morning person, scheduling an early class may not be the best option for you.Make sure you can commit to that time slot and allow yourself enough time to get to campus. Being mindful of these factors will help you keep your academic commitments.


Use time between classes wisely. Make sure you have enough time between classes to meet with a study group, socialize with fellow classmates, or meet with a mentor or professor.;
, Life is busy, and it is important to consider your other commitments when scheduling classes. Ask yourself how many days per week you want to commute to campus. Scheduling courses for 2-3 days per week rather than every weekday may be a better option for your lifestyle.

, Be mindful of the morning and evening rush hours as traffic is typically congested during these times. Remember that you have to factor in time spent driving, parking, and walking to class, and that these times will likely increase during these peak-travel times.Tune in to your local morning news station or radio station to get a traffic report and plan accordingly.

, Many campuses have parking lots that are exclusively for students or faculty. Find out how many parking lots are accessible to you, and be sure to obtain a parking permit when necessary.

, Many schools offer a variety of services for their commuter students. These can include commuter tips, opportunities for connecting with fellow commuters, information on campus security, and off-campus housing options. See what services would be beneficial to you to make the most of your time on campus., Communicate with your professors early in the semester and let them know that you commute to campus. There may be times when you arrive late to class due to traffic, car trouble, or weather conditions. Tell your professor that you will do your best to avoid these circumstances when possible. Your professor will appreciate having this information in advance!, Make a list of what you need for class the day before.

Ask mentors and peers for feedback.",How to Choose an Undergraduate Major," Ask yourself, what am I passionate about? What activity do I enjoy doing? Write down your key interests and then read them over. Maybe one interest really jumps out at you and you can then see if this interest translates into a possible major or field of study. Loving what you are studying will only increase your chances of success in school.


For example, perhaps you write down “spending time with my siblings”, “helping my friends with their problems or issues”, and “working with people.” You may then be able to translate these interests into a field of study that involves supporting and working with young people, such as a major in social work or a major in child psychology.;
, Ask yourself, what am I good at? What skills and abilities come easy to me? What skills and abilities do I feel proud of? Identifying your skills and abilities can help you narrow down your options for your major. You may gravitate to a skill or ability that you have a natural affinity for and translate it into a field of study.


For example, perhaps you write down “good at mathematics”, “able to problem solve”, “good at thinking analytically”. You may then consider a major where you can use your math skills, problem solving skills, and analytical skills, such as engineering or architecture.

, Most undergraduates select a major in their first or second year of school. You may also be required by your academic institution to choose a major by this point in your undergraduate studies. You should consider your academic skills thus far in your undergrad and how you can translate these skills into a major.Look at your grades thus far in your classes. Do you seem to get stronger grades in certain subjects or areas of focus, such as English literature classes or community planning classes? You may then look for majors that include further study on subjects that you excel in.

, You should also think about the goals you would like to achieve in school and once you graduate. Perhaps you would like to graduate with a solid career path, complete with a high pay scale and job security. Or maybe you are more interested in doing graduate school later on, and want to make sure your undergraduate degree will help you get into a certain graduate program.For example, perhaps you are interested and skilled in reading and writing, with a strong interest in English literature. You may also be interested in pursuing a graduate degree later on in English literature so you can teach at the university level. You may then pursue an undergraduate major in English literature or creative writing, with the academic goal of doing graduate school later.
In contrast, maybe you want to graduate with a clear career path and achieve certain goals in your career after school. You may then consider a major like engineering, nursing, or social work, where you can graduate with the skills and expertise needed to enter the workforce.

, Research the undergraduate majors offered at your college or university, as it may help you narrow down your options. You can usually find a list of undergraduate majors on your institution’s website or through your institution’s advising office.Many undergraduate major lists are organized by department or area of interest. You may be able to use an advanced search feature online to look for a specific major.
As you review the list of majors, try to narrow down your options to five to ten specific majors or areas of interest. You can then use these possible majors as guidelines for the rest of your research.

, You should then look at the coursework or curriculum of your possible majors. This will help you determine if the courses in the major will interest you and play to your academic skills and goals.Pay close attention to the pre-requisites required for a specific major, or the classes required to qualify for the major. You may have already taken a few of these pre-requisites in your undergraduate studies or need to take these to qualify.
You should also look at the the skills needed to qualify for the major and make sure these skills sound appealing to you. A major in engineering, for example, may require analytical skills, problem solving skills, and strong communication skills.
You should think about which majors will help you achieve your academic and career goals. You want to choose an undergraduate major that will help you prepare for graduate school or for the workforce, depending on where your goals lie.

, Most majors will offer information sessions on what to expect once you chose the major and what your career options are once you complete your undergraduate degree. You can contact the department directly for details on an information session or look for details on the department website.If there is not information session advertised on the department website, you should still contact the department and ask if you can discuss the major in person with a department advisor. Most departments will be eager and willing to share more information about their department and their major options.

, Reach out to students who enrolled in your preferred majors as advanced undergraduate students. Ask them for feedback on the department and the program as well as their experiences in their major. Getting first hand information from students can really help you determine if the major is actually what you want and fulfill your needs as a student.You may be able to get in touch with current students in the major by contacting the department or the program advisor. You can also ask your peers if they know of any students in a certain major that you can talk to or ask your professors if they can recommend students you can speak to about the program.

, Before you jump right into the major, you may want to take a few introductory courses offered in the department. Look for introductory courses that relate to your potential majors so you can determine if a certain major might be right for you.You may be able to find a list of introductory courses online through the department website or the university website. You can also ask the department advisor for a list of introductory courses you can take to get a better sense of the potential major.

, To ensure you are making an informed decision about your potential major, you should speak to a general advisor to help you compare majors. A general advisor can also provide suggestions and advice on your potential majors.You can find general advisors through your institution’s website or through their student services office. Your institution may also have a student advising office that you can contact for an appointment.
You should bring your list of potential majors with you to your appointment. You should also have a good idea of your skills, abilities, and academic goals so you can discuss them in detail with the advisor.

, You can also reach out to a career counselor at your college or university for advice on your major. Career counselors have the knowledge and expertise to help you determine your passions and interests. They can also provide guidance majors that may be right for you.You can find more information on career counselors through your institution’s student advising office. You should make appointment with a career counselor and bring information on potential majors you are considering with you.

, You should also reach out to faculty members in the areas of study you are considering. Set up a meeting with faculty members via email so you can get more information on the program and determine if the major is right for you.You should ask the faculty members questions about the classes they teach and the goals of the program overall. You should also share your own academic interests and goals to see if they align with what the major has to offer you as a student.
For example, you may ask, “Do you feel this program would fit my interests and goals?”, “Would this program be a good fit for my skills and interests?”, or “How do you see this program meeting my academic needs and goals?”

, You may have a hard time identifying your interests, skills, and goals on your own. Don’t be afraid to ask mentors in your life like former teachers, coaches, and family members for feedback on your goals and skills. You may also ask your peers or friends at school for thoughts on where they think your strengths lie.Keep in mind choosing an undergraduate major is ultimately your decision. Though you may be swayed by feedback or discussions with others about your studies, you will need to be secure and confident enough in your choice based on your own judgement.

Set up a campus visit.",How to Choose an MFA Creative Writing Program," Before you jump right into researching MFA creative writing programs, you should consider your goals as a writer and what you expect to get out of an MFA. MFA programs are a good way to spend two to three years focusing solely on creative work and give you the space to grow as a writer. You will be surrounded by other writers and get a chance to connect to a larger writing community. You may also find mentors in your professors and faculty members who are writers themselves, allowing you to feel supported by their guidance and knowledge.Keep in mind you do not need an MFA to be a successful writer, as some publishers are not partial to writers with an MFA. You are not guaranteed a book deal at the end of an MFA program. If you view an MFA as your only shot at being a legitimate writer, you may want to reconsider your expectations for the degree.Many successful writers do not have MFAs but some do and the value of the degree will often be more personal than professional. Though your chances of landing a teaching position in a writing program may increase if you have an MFA, you will still need to work hard to have a career in teaching creative writing. Having an MFA is a benefit to landing a teaching position, but it is not a guarantee.;
, Though you may end up applying to only MFA programs that offer full funding or partial funding, you will still need to pay for the cost of living, books, and school fees. If you do not get into a funded program, you may end up footing most of the bill for tuition, which can be in the thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars. You should be prepared to take out loans to pay for the MFA or have a large amount of money saved up for tuition.You should look over your finances, paying close attention to any savings or investments you may have. You should be prepared to take out loans to pay for tuition in the event you do not get funding and do not have enough saved to afford school.

, Ask yourself, Do I need an MFA to fulfill my goals as a writer? Will the MFA offer me something I cannot find or create on my own? Considering your current resources as a writer and how an MFA to add or improve upon them is an important step in the process. You want to be sure that the MFA will help you fulfill your goals as a writer and feel worth your time and money.Perhaps you are already a member of a local writing group, but you feel an MFA will help you take your writing to a higher level. Or maybe you have published a few short stories and are working on several different writing projects, but think that an MFA will improve your craft and give you the time to work on these projects.
Consider how the MFA will provide you with opportunities that you cannot create outside of school or a program. If the MFA seems necessary to your goals as a writer, it may be worth pursuing.

, Ask yourself it you are willing to move to a different state, province, city, or town for the MFA. If you are all for relocating, you may research MFAs based in institutions across the country. If you would prefer to stay in your city or state, you may look at local and state institutions to see if they offer MFA creative writing programs.If you do not want to relocate for the program, but you are not interested in programs in your area, you should look into low-residency programs. Low-residency programs allow you to complete your degree without spending time on a particular campus. You will work with faculty members to send and revise work while only having to spend one to two weeks a year on the campus.Low-residency programs are also a good option if you have professional or personal commitments that you cannot move away from, such as a professional career or a family. Many writers also choose low-residency MFAs for financial reasons, as they do not have to factor in the costs of relocating to go to school.

, Because there are so many MFA programs in the country, you may start by looking at the top ranked programs. You can find top MFA creative writing program lists online to get a sense of the “best of the best”.You may set your sights on schools that are highly regarded in the literary world and see if they are a right fit for you.Keep in mind that thought an MFA program is highly rated, it does not necessary mean it will suit you. You may have other considerations, such as where you want to live in the country for two years as well as how much money you can afford to spend on school.
You can view a complete database of MFA creative writing programs at Poets & Writers.com.

, You can also look up where your favorite writers teach, if they do teach, and consider applying to schools where they are full or part time faculty members. Getting the opportunity to take classes and learn from your favorite writers may be a good incentive for you to apply to certain programs.However, you should check to see if your favorite writers are full time faculty and how often they teach in the program. Some bigger name writers may not teach very often in a program or spend very little time actually mentoring students, as they may be occupied with writing their next novel. Ideally, you want faculty that will spend one-on-one time with you and mentor you., A big part of doing an MFA in creative writing is being able to afford the program. You should look for programs that offer full or partial funding to writers who are accepted and prioritize them, especially if you are not financially prepared to pay your own way through school.Often, fully or partially funded programs only accept a small number of students every year, another plus if you’re looking for one-on-one instruction with a certain writer or instructor. Having smaller class sizes can end up being more of a benefit than having a superstar writer as a teacher, as your work may get more hands-on instruction and attention.
You may set your own person limit on how much you are willing to spend on your MFA. You may then have a hard line on applying for programs that only offer full funding or try applying for a mix of programs that offer full funding, partial funding, and no funding.

, If a certain MFA program does not offer funding, you may check for other sources of funding or financial support through the institution. This could be a teaching assistant (TA) position, where you assist a professor and get paid for your services by getting your tuition costs covered by the university. You should also look into a graduate assistant (GA) position in another department or a mentorship program where you mentor undergraduate students in exchange for tuition remission.


Landing a TA position or a GA position can also allow you to get valuable teaching experience. This may be useful later if you plan to pursue a career teaching in higher education, as you can show employers that you have teaching experience at the undergraduate level.
You may need to contact the financial aid or scholarship office at the institution for more information on other funding options.

, You should also review the classes that are offered in the MFA program to see if they are of interest to you and relate to your writing. Look for a program that seems to speak to your interests and goals as a writer, as it will likely be a better fit overall.For example, some programs offer classes in hypertext or new media and they encourage interdisciplinary studies, where you can take classes in other genres like poetry or non-fiction. Some programs are more traditional, offering only workshop classes and seminars around certain craft elements in writing.

, You should also check to see if the MFA program offers other perks, such as visits to the program by literary agents, which could increase your chances of getting published. The program may also have guest teachers and visiting writers who run workshops and seminars for students, which could be a perk if one of the visiting writers is someone you would like to work with and learn from.


Some programs also have higher publishing rates for their graduates and are renowned in the literary world for the high caliber of their graduates. You should look for a program that fits your budget and your needs, but also consider the other perks offered by the program.

, You should speak to writers who are currently in the program as well as writers who have graduated from the program. This will help you get a better sense of the program as a whole and have an informed idea of what it is like to be a student in the program. Current and former students may also be able to offer advice on how to apply for the program as well as how to find housing once you have been accepted to the program.You can request contact information for current and former students through the program’s applications page or the program’s prospective student contact.
You should send a list of questions to these students to help you get some perspective on the program. You may ask, “What has your experience been like in the program?”, “How has the program improved your writing?”, and “What is the most positive and least positive aspect of the program?”

, You should also reach out to writers who are on the faculty of programs you are interested in applying to. You may be able to find their contact information on the program’s website or through the prospective student’s office at the institution. Talking to faculty members will help you get a better sense of the teaching style in the program.Reaching out to faculty members can also allow you to see how responsive and in touch they are with student requests. If the faculty member appears friendly and full of information and interest, this may be a good sign. Ideally you want faculty members who appear dedicated to their students, even prospective ones.

, You can also get a better sense of the MFA creative writing program by arranging a visit to the campus. This is especially important if you are planning to relocate to a new city or town for the school. You want to be sure you can handle living in the new city for at least two to three years and feel comfortable on campus.You may set up campus visits before you apply for MFA programs or once you have been accepted to a few programs. Either way, a campus visit is a good way to get a sense of the institution and what your standard of living will be like if you choose a particular program.

Seek out schools with classes in one or more VEE (Validation by Educational Experience) topic.,
Determine the job placement rate of a program.,
Consider tuition and financial aid.,
Think about geography.",How to Choose a Degree to Become an Actuary1," Most, actuarial science programs will prepare you for one or two actuarial exams, while some may even prepare you for three or four. Seek out a program that will prepare for you at least two exams in order to increase the return on your investment.For example, programs that boast preparation for two exams include Eastern Michigan University, Oakland University, and Aurora University.
Appalachian State University will prepare you for three exams, and Roosevelt University will prepare you for four.;
, When you apply to take CAS or SOA actuary exams (to become board certified), the first thing they will do is to verify your education in a screening called VEE (or Validation by Educational Experience).

, By looking at a school’s website and by speaking to a recruitment representative for the actuarial science department, determine the overall job placement rate for a given program. The actuary science business is growing at a rate of 26% per year, so a strong program should have a job placement rate above 80%. You can locate these figures by visiting the school’s website or by speaking to a recruitment representative., If you are pursuing an actuarial career, you are probably someone who already aims to manage risk. As such, important factors to keep in mind when selecting a university program include the cost of tuition (plus fees and living expenses), and your ability to obtain financial aid. Find out the tuition costs (and related expenses) for different schools and compare them.

Consider a different major.,
Look for a program with an actuary emphasis.,
Make sure they can prepare you for at least one actuarial exam.,
Work toward diversity.,
Consider your strengths.",How to Choose a Degree to Become an Actuary2," A degree in actuary science is not required to take the needed exams and enter this field. Instead, you can enter any university program that offers a strong foundation in calculus, statistics, probability, economics, finance, management, and computer science. Consider majoring in math, business, or statistics., If you are leaning towards majoring in math, business, or statistics look for a program that offers an actuary emphasis, minor, or sub-focus. This will ensure that you will receive some of the core training necessary to pass a Validation of Educational Experience (VEE) and qualify for actuary exams later on., As a student in a math, business, or statistics major (as opposed to an actuary science major), not every aspect of your program will be geared towards passing future actuarial exams. However, your department should be aware of such requirements and be able to meet them. Look for information about actuarial exam preparation on the school’s website, or inquire about this from recruitment representative., There can be one notable benefit to pursuing a degree in math, business, or statistics: background diversity. When a firm is hiring actuaries for its team, they will not want everyone to have the same exact educational background and training. Diverse backgrounds create a more fertile environment for ideas to flow.

, Another benefit to entering a degree in math, business, or statistics is that it may give you more freedom to play on your strengths. Whereas a degree in actuarial science will give you a well-rounded encounter with many aspects of the field, a degree in math, business, or statistics allows you to specialize in an area where you excel.

Pass several actuarial examinations.,
Become a “fellow.” Once you have obtained your associate certification, and spent a few years working in the field, you may wish to seek a fellowship through the CAS or SOA.",How to Choose a Degree to Become an Actuary3," To work as an actuary, you must become board certified by either the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) or the Society of Actuaries (SOA), first as an “associate” and eventually as a “fellow.” If you understand how this process works, you will be better able to select the right degree program for you.The Society of Actuaries (SOA) works with actuaries in life/health insurance, employee benefits, and pensions.
The Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) works with actuaries in automobile, fire, and liability insurance and workers' compensation.
There are other actuary societies (such as the Canadian Institute of Actuaries, or CIA), but these will require either the CAS or SOA exams.

, In order to qualify for these exams, a committee must verify your college course work in applied statistics, corporate finance, and economics. When you apply to take the first exam (via the websites for CAS or SOA), a appointed committee will look over your grades, transcripts, and possibly your test scores to assess whether or not you have been appropriately trained in these areas. Strong programs in actuary science (and related fields) will outline which VEE areas they offer, and will ensure a passable level of course work and preparation.

, If you have been trained in a specific actuarial science program, you may have already had courses in “professionalism” and “the fundamentals of actuarial practice.” If you do not have these specific courses on your transcript, you will need to complete them. These classes are offered by each actuarial society, both online and in person, and can range from $45 to $120 per course., To become certified through the CAS, you must pass seven exams, whereas the SOA requires five exams. Each exam requires a great deal of preparation. It is highly recommended for you to obtain the official study manual for each exam ($75 and up), as well as additional materials like flashcards, practice tests, and study workbooks.The first four SOA Exams (P/1, FM/2, MFE/3F, and C/4) are administered alongside the CAS exams, and qualify for both the CAS and SOA organizations.
The remaining first-tier exam is different for SOA and CAS. For SOA, the final exam is the MLC exam. For the CAS, the remaining exam is exam 3L.
In order to become an associate with CAS, you must still take three more exams
In order too become an associate with SOA, you will take just one more.

, This will improve your status as an actuary and lead to higher pay.In order to become a CAS fellow, you must pass two more exams.
In order to become a SOA fellow, you must select one of five specific career tracks—advanced finance, financial theory and engineering, financial health and economics, financial reporting, or operations risk. The requirements differ for each track requires, with some requiring additional education modules, and others more exams.

, Some master’s programs have very specific requirements for entry. You will need to have a certain score on the GMAT or GRE, an undergraduate degree in a related field, work experience for MBA programs, and specific coursework and lab experience for science programs. If you don’t meet this prerequisites, consider taking the necessary courses before applying to the program.Check with each program that you are considering and make sure that you meet all the requirements before applying.

, You may be obtaining a master's degree to advance your career. Ask how many graduates from the program are employed and in what sort of careers. Many programs have specific career services related to the field.


Ask what the school does to help students find careers after graduation. Many schools connect students to alumni and host career fairs.

, Some graduate programs have opportunities for internships, fellowships, fieldwork, and studying abroad. If any of these are of interest to you or considered essential to your education, narrow your focus to schools that have these prospects.Look for diversity in the program. The more a program has to offer, the better it is.

, Many graduate programs require you to have an advisor or mentor. This advisor will be a member of the faculty within the program that you choose. If a university does not have faculty that match your academic interests, the program won’t be a good fit for you no matter its reputation.Unlike undergraduate programs, graduate-level programs are more focused on specific areas, so it is in your best interests to find one that caters to your goals.
Look at what the faculty are researching, check out their publications, and any personal websites.

, Look at the departmental websites and find at least 5 professors whose work interests you and fits in with your academic goals. Write a letter or email to each professor expressing your interest in the master's program and his or her work. Include a copy of your resume with the letter. Be genuine in the letters, and make them meaningful. Express your interest in his or her work and how it relates to your academic interests.Always spell-check the letter before sending it.
Ask the professors if they would be available for a phone conference to discuss the master's program. You may need to be persistent. If you haven't received a response within about 3 weeks, follow up via phone or email.
For example, if you want to study playwriting, look for professors whose plays you've enjoyed. If you want to study genetics, look for professors who have made great strides in the field.

, Many universities have open houses or days specifically available for you to visit the campus and meet the faculty.Contact the professors you have been in touch with and see if you can meet with them in person.


Inquire about research opportunities, teaching fellowships, or internships at each school. If your goal is to become a professor, a program that includes teaching is an absolute must.
Check out the school's library and other relevant areas, such as the laboratories, theaters, or media centers. Ideally, a graduate school will offer up-to-date facilities and have a decent research library as well as access to relevant databases.

, Take a look around the city the school is in as well. You may like the school, but hate the area where it’s located. If you have a family to consider, you’ll want to look at programs in your local area. If weather is important to you, take a look at the climate and the type of weather that area tends to get.Remember, master’s degrees usually take two years to complete so these are all important things to keep in mind when making decisions.

, The best way to gauge if a program is a good fit for you is to talk to people who are currently in it. Ask them how they feel about studying there, are the students treated well and respected, do they have access to the resources they truly need, and any other specific questions you may have.Some schools look impressive on paper or have impressive faculty but are not a good fit for every personality.

, Master’s programs can be quite costly so it’s a good idea to figure out how much the degree is going to cost. Knowing the cost can help you choose by narrowing down to the programs you can afford.If you are looking into a public school, look at in-state tuition if you are a resident. Otherwise, budget for out-of-state tuition.
Keep in mind that online schools can cost less than a brick-and-mortar school.
Don’t forget to factor in books and supplies, housing, and student fees in addition to tuition.

, Student loans are not the only option to fund your master’s degree. Some schools have scholarships for specific programs that can help you with your finances. Scholarship opportunities are another aspect to consider when you decide where to apply.Inquire about financial aid as well. While many doctorate programs provide full funding, many master's programs do not.
You may need to take out student loans to attend the master's program if it does not offer fellowships or grants, which can impact your decision.

, Student loans are always an option for affording your degree. The return on investment for a master’s degree is generally considered to be a 15% higher overall lifetime income.It will take time to pay off the loans, but you will be able to do it with the higher income from the graduate degree.


Try to get a combination of scholarships and student loans.

, When considering schools and programs don’t forget to take into account all of your financial obligations. If you have a family, your financial needs are going to be much different than an individual. If your finances are tight, look for places where you can spend less money.


If you live alone, try getting some roommates to lower your rent.
If you eat out a lot or get your coffee on the go, try making more meals at home and bringing coffee with you from your own kitchen.

Speak up in class.,
Set boundaries with a roommate.,
Assert yourself in dating situations.,
Stand up to peer pressure.",How to Become More Assertive During Your College Years1," Many people in college find it difficult to have the confidence to speak up in class. You may feel intimidated by your classmates or professor, or you may be afraid to mess up with the wrong answer. Class participation is important for your education, not only so you learn how to confidently express your ideas and knowledge, but many professors incorporate it into your grade.If you need your professor to explain or repeat something, raise your hand and ask them to explain what they just said. You should make sure that you understand what your professor is saying.
Do your class readings and listen to your professor's lectures so you can answer questions when they are asked. If you know the material the professor is covering, that will give you more confidence to speak up and answer the question. Just remember not to answer every question or be a know-it-all. This may take frustrate your professor.Start asserting yourself in class by raising your hand once each class when you know the answer. Sometimes, your professor will just ask for a comment about a topic, which has no right or wrong answer. That is a good time to speak up.
Remember that giving the wrong answer in class is not a bad thing. Part of learning in college is speaking up and learning how to discuss in an academic setting.
The more you practice, the more comfortable you will be speaking in class.;
, Sharing space with another person means you need to assert yourself as you set boundaries. This may be uncomfortable if you have never had to assert yourself before. When you first move in, you and your roommate need to establish what items you share and what you won't.For example, you may decide to share expenses for food. You may say, ""You can eat my cereal and milk, but next time you go out, will you pick up replacements?"" or, ""I'll buy this week's snack food if you'll buy next week's.""
Your living space should be shared equally. If your roommate has their stuff in your area, you may want to say, ""I don't mind if you have your stuff in our room, but it's taking up space in my area. Can you move it back to your space?"" or, ""We need to discuss sharing this space. I think my stuff has less space. Can we look into this?""
You and your roommate may need to discuss when to have friends or significant others over. For example, you may need to say, ""I don't mind if your boyfriend/girlfriend comes over, but I would prefer them not to spend the night,"" or, ""I respect that you want your friends over until late, but can you only do that on weekends? I have early classes and need to go to bed.""
You may need to do this for other situations as well, such as with borrowing clothes, washing dishes, sharing toiletries, and quiet time.

, College is a great time to date and learn what you like romantically and sexually; however, dating and experimenting does not mean you should allow others to make you do things you don't want to do. If you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation or do not want to do an activity, firmly say ""no."" If you are not interested in seeing someone again, let them know firmly but politely. Don't be afraid if the other person won't like it.For example, if you are on a date and the other person wants to go farther sexually than you want, you have the right to stop whenever you want. You shouldn't worry about whether or not the other person will get upset. You should only do what makes you comfortable. If the other person likes you, they will respect that.
Say, ""I like you, but I am not comfortable with that. Let's continue watching the movie,"" or, ""Don't do that,"" ""I don't like that,"" or ""Take me home, please.""
If you do not want to see someone again, say, ""You're a very nice person, but I don't think this is going to work out romantically. I am not interested in another date.""

, When you are in college, you may find yourself in situations where you have to stand up to others. You may have to assert yourself to say no if you don't want to do something. You may have to stand up for what's right if people are saying hurtful or harmful things to another person. Practice speaking up for what you believe in when you feel strongly about something.For example, if you are at a party and someone offers you drugs, you can simply say, ""No, thank you."" If they keep pressuring you, you can say, ""No, I'm really not interested.""
If you hear someone talking badly about someone, try saying, ""I do not appreciate your derogatory language about that person. Can you not talk that way?"" or, ""That kind of talk is offensive and harmful. Please do not talk that way.""

Consider the benefits of music.,
Determine what you will be studying for.,
Create a studying music mix.,
Determine when you will be studying.,
Be aware of where you will be studying.,
Recognize who you will be studying with.",How to Choose Music when Studying for College Courses," Music plays a critical role in our everyday life. Even in school, playing music helps us concentrate and grasp the information we are reading. When in the exam room, always picture yourself not doing the exam but studying and in the background music if playing. This way you’ll be able to remember all you learnt during your study sessions and will ace that test!


Everyday set aside one hour or two hours to study on your own, while studying play some classical music or soothing jazz. You shall find out that the more you play these genres of music the more you are able to concentrate with your studying!;
,



Studying for Midterm Exams: The midterm season is the necessary evil that always has to feature in between and mess up two of the top of the highest holidays (Oktoberfest and Halloween). As a college student these are two of the most attended holiday parties of the year. But when Midterm exams are just around the corner, students get busy brewing coffee around the clock. Now everyone is in a hurry rushing somewhere with an exhausted brain that has been working 72hrs nonstop. And it reaches a point where you find yourself napping over a 1000 page project or textbook!

If you are such a student (as everybody is) it's time you managed your time wisely and avoided getting exhausted but scored well on the test. You should start by blocking out the evil noise and instead now listen to the below mentioned sound study techniques that will help you ace that exam!



Studying for Finals Exams: The finals are several weeks away but you are sweating yourself off wondering whether you’ll fail them.

Instead of panicking, play some music pump up the volume in your room and to psyche yourself up play some fast music such as hip hop or dance music.
The more you feel in-tune with the music the more you’ll be able to calm down and prepare yourself to study. Create a timetable and stick to it. If it’s time to meet your study group, be the first to arrive, the one who contributes most and the one who leaves last.



, Yes it’s the midterms and your need to ace that exam since it reflects on your finals. But you’ve been preoccupied ever since campus season began. If you want to play catch up with your studying, music will help you.


To get started, play a music mix of easy/soft music, the music will help you not to memorize the words of the songs playing but help you clear your head and fill it with the necessary information you need to equip yourself with for the exam.
The music will help you sync the info and in the exam room you’ll remember a certain song and when you hum it you’ll remember the information you read!

,


Morning hours:

You should listen to more of a contemporary type of music.
Music with low bass would be recommended.
You might have more energy in the morning so simple music could be used for background noise
If you live with people and they are getting ready for the day the noise can be distracting so music can definitely block out those noises


Night hours:

More upbeat music would be recommended, especially if you are feeling sleepy
Energizing beats can be effective when getting your thoughts flowing
At night, most environments where students usually study become more quiet. Libraries become empty. There are no distractions such as visitors or calls.
Studying at night can be a downfall if you have had a rough day and when you are finally ready to study, you are worn out.Nighttime studying can also be bad, because if an assignment or project pops up and needs to be done right away that you hadn't planned for, it can throw your studying schedule off and take away that time you needed to study.



, Where you decide to study as a college student is very important. For in this place you should be comfortable and able to concentrate. Creating your ideal study space is vital, for this will be your go-to space for the next few years. No matter what you need to study your environment will remain constant.


Where you study comes down to who you are. If you need a quiet space with less distractions then your dorm or the library is a preferable place to study. However, if you need a creative outlet then being outdoors or your local coffee shop may be just what you need.
Pick a location and music that is relevant to what you are studying. Studies show the greater the similarity between personal connections to what you are studying, the more inferences you create for the subject, giving you a better likelihood for remembering the information for the test.
Prepare your study space with everything you will need, including your study playlist, textbooks, notes, or anything else you need in your study environment. You do not want to lose focus or be distracted by any outside disturbances.

,


The people you choose to study with will have an impact on the type of music you will decide to listen to. You must take into account your colleagues’ preferences in order to choose the best music for your study session.
The different types of music you may decide to listen to could vary from rock, pop, classical, jazz, instrumental, hip hop, country and much more. However, it may be distracting for one of your group members who dislikes rock to study while you are fully concentrated. It is important to consider the likes and dislikes of others for both to effectively study. For instance, you must take into account the difference in culture, lyrics, rhythms, and tones. If you are in a group where everyone agrees to listening to classical music while you study then it would be an appropriate genre to choose. Otherwise, it is proper to be willing to pick a genre of music you could all agree upon.
According to CNN, “brain activation patterns are related to how much people like particular songs”, therefore, there is a benefit to music when studying.Music reduces anxiety and will increase your productivity.
Once you jot down the list of songs or types of music your group would like to listen to while studying then you can create a playlist. Your willingness to consider the preference of others will increase concentration and allow you to have a productive academic session. Studying with one person or more while listening to music will benefit you if you enjoy working with others. Now that you will consider the likes and dislikes of your colleagues’ you are well on your way to creating an effective music playlist!

The chosen countries have varied some over time. New locations are being considered for the scholarship. Currently the Rhodes Scholarship is only available for those who live in:Australia
Bermuda
Canada
Germany
Hong Kong
India
Jamaica and the Commonwealth Caribbean
Kenya
New Zealand
Pakistan
Southern Africa (South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia and Swaziland)
United States
Zambia
Zimbabwe;
, You must be a minimum of 18 years old to apply for the Rhodes Scholarship. In most countries, you cannot be older than 24 by October 1 of the year following your selection. A few countries may extend this age limit to 25 or even to 28. Check with your home country's guidelines.The Rhodes Scholarship maintains a list of country-specific information here: http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/about/rhodes-countries.

, The Rhodes Scholarship is one of the most prestigious scholarships in the world. Mr. Rhodes set “literary and scholastic attainments” as the first criteria for the scholarship in his will.You will be required to submit your academic transcripts, and you will want to make sure they look stellar.


Take advanced classes.
Double or triple up on majors.
Get really good grades. Aim for a 4.0 GPA.
While there is no minimum GPA to become a Rhodes scholar, the organization says that “if it is unlikely that you would be admitted to one of the very most selective U.S. graduate programs in your primary field, it is unlikely that you will win a Rhodes Scholarship.”, Rhodes mentions using “one's talents to the full, as exemplified by fondness for and success in sports” as one of the qualities of a Rhodes scholar.If you have a disability that prevents you from participating in sports, don't worry. The idea is to demonstrate that you have extraordinary energy and drive. You can participate in other extracurricular activities, such as debate, drama, or chess club, to demonstrate that you are pursuing using your talents ""to the full."", This service element of a Rhodes scholar is crucial. Years of volunteer work, or other kinds of service to others, contribute a fundamental piece to winning applications. Padding your resume by suddenly volunteering is frowned upon. Establish a record of service early in your high school career.
Protection and sympathy for the weak is specifically mentioned by Mr. Rhodes in his will. Service that emphasizes community engagement for marginalized groups, such as volunteering at a homeless shelter or serving elderly shut-ins, will demonstrate your commitment in this area., A person who wins the Rhodes Scholarship must have completed or be expected to complete an undergraduate degree from an accredited institution by October 1 in the year following selection. If this is not the case, you will be ineligible for the scholarship.Scholarship offers cannot usually be deferred., Because you will need to have five to eight letters of recommendation, developing good relationships with your professors is crucial. Take special efforts to work with your professors, teachers and mentors. They can not only help you by writing letters of recommendation, but they can also help guide your growth toward your scholastic goals.Visit your professor's office hours.
Be engaged and respectful in class.
Get a cup of coffee with them.

State your needs.,
Use “I” statements.,
Say no.,
Be patient.",How to Become More Assertive During Your College Years2," People are not going to know what you need unless you tell them. Assuming that people know things can lead to problems. Being assertive means that you let people know what you want in a clear way so that your needs are met and there are no problems or feelings of resentment.For example, if you are working on a project, you may want to say, “I want to have this project done three days before it is due. Will you meet with me this weekend so we can work on most of it?”

, When talking to another person, use “I” statements instead of “you” statements. This helps you express what you want without blaming the other person. This also helps you be responsible for your feelings. The word “you” may cause the other person to be defensive, which doesn’t lead to a constructive conversation.For example, you may say, “I feel upset when my clothes are returned dirty. I know we like to borrow each other’s clothes, so can we talk about this?” instead of ""You always borrow my clothes and don't wash them before giving them back.""

, Part of being assertive is learning to say no. Saying no doesn’t mean that you are rejecting a person or being mean. It means that you are just expressing your unwillingness to do this particular thing. Recognizing your boundaries helps you know the right time to say no so you are not being taken advantage of.Remember that you don’t have to please everyone and it is, in fact, impossible to do so. You do not have to do everything everyone wants you to. Do what is right for you.
Suggest a compromise.
For example, you may say, “No, I do not want to go to the party Friday night; however, I would be interested in going to the movies or hanging out in your dorm room.”

, If you have never been assertive, you will not learn how to be assertive overnight. That is okay. It may take awhile for you to learn how not to be passive or aggressive, or to get the skills of being assertive just right.Keep practicing. The more you practice the skills of assertiveness, the more comfortable you will become.

"
"
Use proper body language and tone of voice.,
Speak with facts.,
Use clear statements.,
Express your emotions positively.,
Listen to the other person.,
Suggest compromise.",How to Become More Assertive During Your College Years3," When you are speak assertively, you should adopt the proper cues in your voice and body. Your body should be relaxed and open, which invites communication. Your voice should be firm, but also calm and clear.Your body should be facing the other person. You should stand tall, but be relaxed.
Maintain eye contact without staring the other person down.
Your voice should be firm, but you should also speak warmly or relaxed. Use short, direct sentences and speak slowly so that you are understood.

, To help you be assertive, you should learn how to speak in facts instead of criticisms or judgments. This helps to avoid any defensiveness or blame, and instead keep the conversation constructive. This is particularly important when you are giving criticism.For example, you may say, “Your grammar needs work and the sources are not cited correctly,” or, “There is mud on your shoes and socks.”

, When communicating what you want, you should use clear, direct language.This helps you assert your needs in a way that others will understand. There will be no confusion. Frame these statements with the word “I.”Use statements like “I want…,” “I need…,” “I disagree. I think…,” or “I won’t…”

, As you deal with situations, you may find that you are angry or frustrated. This is okay, and you should let yourself feel the emotions you feel. If you are angry, you can tell the person you are angry, but in a positive, respectful way. Being assertive means you think of the other’s feelings and rights.For example, you may say, “I am angry that plans keep getting cancelled at the last minute,” or, “I get angry when my significant other ignores my feelings.”

, Part of being assertive is listening to the other person. This includes their opinions, their suggestions, or their concerns. Remaining calm and respectful help keep the conversation constructive, and helps both of your voices be heard and your needs met.Actively listening to what the other person is saying can help you come up with an alternate solution that doesn’t take advantage of either of you. It can also help you come to a compromise.
For example, you may say, “I hear your concerns. Let’s find a way to solve this problem where we both get what we need.”
Listening empathetically does not mean you need to agree with what the person is saying, or that you will concede to the other person's wants/views. Saying ""I understand,"" ""That must be awful,"" or ""I see what you mean"" are not concessions, but are simply good communication techniques. You can still assert yourself and your needs after expressing understanding or concern.

, Compromise is a large part of being assertive. When you are assertive, you understand that other people’s views and ideas matter, so that means you meet them halfway. If you are requesting something, you may suggest a compromise. If someone asks something of you that you don’t necessarily like, make a compromise with them that both of you are comfortable with.For example, you may say, “You can borrow my shirt if you promise to bring it back clean,” or “I will hang out with on another night.”

"
"
Know what being assertive means.,
Identify passive behavior.,
Recognize aggressive behavior.,
Note passive-aggressive behavior.",How to Become More Assertive During Your College Years4," When you are assertive, you clearly express your ideas, opinions, or feelings. Expressing your ideas assertively means that you understand that you have the right to stand up for your opinions and ask for someone to change their behavior. Assertiveness also means that you respect other opinions and don’t ignore their opinions.An assertive person is open to other ways of thinking. They also encourage communication and compromise about the topic.
Assertive people think carefully about what they say. They make eye contact and keep a relaxed body posture.

, Passive people rarely speak their mind. When they do speak their mind, they are quiet, unsure, and apologetic. This often leads to others taking advantage of these people. Passive people act like their ideas don’t matter as much as other people’s. Passive people want to avoid conflict.Passive people display passive body language. They don’t make eye contact, they speak softly, and often they appear nervous. A passive person may have trouble getting words out.
Passive people sometimes let others make choices for them.

, Aggressive people also stand up for themselves, but in a way that impinges on other people’s rights or beliefs. Aggressive people usually make the other person feel humiliated or like they have a lack of control. Aggressive people aim to win arguments or dominate discussions at the expense of others.Aggressive people make eye contact, but in a threatening manner. They may sound arrogant, tower over another person, or appear stiff and rigid.

, People who are passive-aggressive do not come out and say what they want, think, and feel but instead try to manipulate situations, ideas, or people to achieve what they can't say out loud. They attempt to avoid a disagreement in the short-term by not expressing their true feelings and then may feel angry when their needs are not met. Instead of speaking up about this, they will retaliate in some way that is meant to ""get back"" at the other person without them recognizing the underlying anger.Passive-aggressive behaviors include sulking, giving someone the silent treatment, gossiping, or pretending not to see, hear, or remember something. For instance, instead of saying, ""I can't make it to your party on Saturday,"" the person might not show up to the party and, when asked later, say ""You were having a party? Oh, I must not have seen your text!""
Passive-aggressive behavior can be very damaging to a relationship. If you recognize that someone is being passive-aggressive, make the choice not to engage. Instead, you might calmly call them on behavior.
Say something like, ""It seems like you're angry that I asked you to pick up your clothes."" If the person denies it (and they likely will), don't argue. Just say, ""Okay, I just thought I'd ask.""

Conclude your essay with statement of authenticity.",How to Become a Rhodes Scholar2," The personal essay for the Rhodes Scholarship is no simple matter. This essay will need to be highly crafted in order to show how capable you are. Make certain that you have fully developed your essay by outlining and making many drafts of your work.


Brainstorm ideas before you outline. By using techniques like thought webs and diagrams, you can help yourself expand your ideas.
Make an outline. This will enable you to carefully structure your essay, before you sit down to write. It can help you to see the big picture in your personal essay.
Write many drafts. Don't be satisfied with just a rough draft, first draft, and final copy. That is not enough. You may need to write fifteen to twenty versions of your essay before you get it just right., In less than one thousand words,you must craft a personal statement which convinces the selection committee you're worth an interview. While there are many different ways to address the personal statement, there are some points each candidate should touch on. An applicant needs to:Discuss your academic interests and passions.
Show how your experiences have led you to apply, and where this experience at Oxford will take you.
Showcase your genuine voice; topics and styles vary widely among candidates.

, Avoid writing a resume-essay. Don't just list your achievements. Have an overarching theme or larger argument to center all your achievements and experiences together. This will give your essay shape and make it more engaging.


If your essay feels like all you're doing is saying “And then....and then....and then...”, your essay is probably not very engaging.
Make sure to touch on what makes you unique, why you deserve the scholarship, and the larger motivations that drive your study and work., The application committee wants to know about you, your plans, and why you would like to study at Oxford. This essay gives you the opportunity to weave a narrative for the selection committee, demonstrating why you are such a stellar candidate. It is important that you give a clear statement of what you wish to study at Oxford and why, and to connect it to this narrative.Make certain that you are specific in this portion. If your essay merely reads like you wish to study at Oxford because it would be ""cool"" or ""fun,"" you are unlikely to succeed.Look through the websites of Oxford's various colleges. See if you can find a faculty member with whom you would be interested in working. Referencing specific programs, courses, and faculty members will show that you have done your research and are prepared for rigorous academic study.

, It must read: “I attest that this personal statement is my own work and is wholly truthful. Neither it nor any earlier draft has been edited by anyone other than me, nor has anyone else reviewed it to provide me with suggestions to improve it. I understand that any such editing or review would disqualify my application.”Follow this with your signature.

If you aren't at college yet, research common majors and what people do with them. Once you decide on a few solid choices, look for colleges that are known for strong programs in those fields.
If you are already at a college and you don't want to transfer, look at the available majors that are listed on your university website.;
, Question your teachers and academic counselors about careers, majors, and the college industry. Make sure to also speak with people who know you well: your friends, parents, and relatives. These people may be able to give you valuable advice about your strengths and weaknesses. Don't choose a major just because someone tells you to, and make sure that you take every suggestion with a grain of salt – but don't be afraid to look for inspiration.


Speak with people who have already completed certain majors. Ask for their perspective. Find out what they might do differently.
Talk to advisers from your chosen college. You can find a lot of information on the web about different majors. However, it's best to talk to a professional adviser. They can help answer questions about any department that you're considering joining.

, This varies widely from college to college. Some schools require that you decide upon a major by the time that you set foot inside your first class. Other schools may variably give you one year, two years, or more to declare. If you are uncertain, try to take your time before committing to a singular focus. If you have the freedom to explore, take the opportunity to sample a wide variety of courses and majors that catch your eye!, If you don't have a major or a goal in mind, college can be a very expensive way to find yourself. Think about taking a gap year, working full-time, or fulfilling your general education requirements at a community college before committing to a four-year degree.You can save money and travel the world; you can volunteer or work abroad; you can audit classes for free, or attend school part-time; you can try to join the workforce in a field that sounds interesting, then use that experience to inform your college major decision. Do it your way!Remember that you don't need to go to college right away just because a lot of other people are doing it. Consider whether you are being shepherded into this. Do you know what you want to get out of your college experience? Is it your choice, or is it your parents'?

, There are probably a few majors that jump out at you from the start. Begin by exploring what it might mean to pursue those degrees. If you love to write, then it is natural to gravitate toward a creative writing degree, or toward another of the humanities. If you love to solve problems, then you might find yourself drawn to engineering or the sciences. Let the answer be simple: think about what you already love to do.


On the other hand, you may find your calling in a major that you initially dismiss. You may not discover your love for economics until you take an introductory econ class. Trust your gut, but keep an open mind.
It can be hard to trust your gut when you are drawn to several different majors. What if you can see yourself happily majoring in Biology, Music, or Computer Science? Remember that you can always mix majors and minors. You can even choose a double major, if you're up to the challenge!

, Ask yourself where you want to be in five years. Consider the sort of life that you want to live. What is important to you? Perhaps you want to make a lot of money; fight climate change; write a novel; work with numbers, or work with people; change the world, or just make a living. You may not have a lot of concrete answers, but it doesn't hurt to start thinking about this.Research the job market. If your top priority is finding a job quickly upon graduation, then it might help to find out which jobs are in high demand. Try to use this knowledge to your advantage.

, ""Auditing"" is the act of enrolling in a class without taking a grade or credit for the work.No matter whether you are actively enrolled at a particular college, or finishing up high school, or not in school at all: visit a university and sit in on a few courses that sound interesting. Find specific classes in the ""courses"" or ""undergraduate programs"" section of the university website. Email the instructor and ask about auditing. In many cases, you'll be able to sit in on a class for an entire semester, for free, as long as you stay engaged and don't disrupt the professor.The instructor's name and contact information should be listed on the website alongside the course description. If you can't find the contact information, search the department website or run a web search for the professor.
If a school has very large lectures—hundreds of people in one room—you might not even need to reach out to the professor. Accompany a friend to a big lecture, or just filter in with the enrolled crowd. This can be a great, free way to feel out a course.

, Most colleges have some deadline by which point you must officially choose a major. This may be one year, two years, or more. It is good to be intentional about this decision, and to choose a major that you like. However, you may find that the act of declaring a focus makes it much easier to see what you want and don't want. Once you've spent a semester taking classes and trying to work toward a certain major, you'll have a much better idea of what it means to pursue that degree.Choose something that excites you. Don't just pick a major at random from the catalog. Be honest with yourself, and give it a real shot.

, Once you choose a major, you've effectively stated your purpose, and you've given yourself a track for moving forward in college. You have not, however, locked yourself into anything irreversible. Many people change their majors several times before they settle upon something. Some people even go back for a second degree. Try to keep perspective., Remember that you can always change course! If you aren't happy with the major that you pick, you can switch to something more fulfilling. If your college doesn't offer the major that you want, you can always transfer to another school. There is always a way out. Don't be afraid to dive into a major that interests you, even if you aren't 100 percent certain.


You may find that it's easy to switch between similar majors. For instance, many classes may overlap between the English degree path and the Comparative Literature path. You may find a lot of common ground between the Biology track and the Environmental Science track.The general education requirements (GEs) are usually fairly similar across a ""department"" or ""school"" within a university. For instance, many of the introductory classes for the Mechanical Engineering track probably apply to other tracks within the engineering department. Biology, Chemistry, and Physics degree paths often require some mixture of the same introductory science courses.

, Many college degrees organize classes and students under broad themes and concepts, giving you plenty of room to define your own focus. Choose a concentration within the major. Supplement with a double major, if you can handle the workload. Pursue a minor (or two!) that gives you an outlet for your other interests. Don't be afraid to engage with a degree path and make it your own."

Real scholars question everything they hear or read. They never take information at face value, and try to make sure the information that they're working with is true.
If something seems off, it just might be! Even things that seem right may be wrong, so make sure you're working with the facts.;
,


Scholars are people who are naturally curious. They want to know everything!
You should be naturally curious too, and always try to find out how and why things work the way they do.

,


Scholars love to learn about everything.
They enjoy the act of learning itself, not being smarter than other people or knowing more facts.
It's not a party trick: it's what really makes them happy!

,


Take in all sides of an argument and as much information as you can before forming an opinion.
Come to your opinions on your own, rather than taking them from someone else. This is an important skill for scholars.

,


Scholars have to be willing to change their mind when they get new information that challenges their previous views. This is one of the most important skills for a scholar.
Be open minded and willing to be wrong, in the pursuit of being right.

,


Don't let your personal feelings inform your actions or the information that you give to others.
Just because you don't agree with something doesn't make it not true.
Give all information a chance and don't let your bias color your conclusions.

,


The best way to learn without getting a formal education is to read a lot. Read as much as you can at every opportunity. This, in and of itself, can make you a scholar (since a scholar is really just someone who is learning all the time).
You can read books that you buy, but don't forget that you can also go to your local library and get loads of books for free! The internet has made lots of library systems much easier to use, letting you find, order, and renew books right from your home.
There are also loads of books in the public domain, which you can get free digital copies of to keep. Project Gutenberg is the most famous, but you can also get many through Amazon's Kindle program.

,


Did you know that you can take classes without trying to get a degree? If you're interested in learning a particular skill or about a particular subject, you can take classes in just that, without the cost of an entire degree. Some classes may even be free.
Talk to your local community college about auditing classes (this means taking the class but not doing any of the homework or tests and not getting credit or a grade).
You can also talk directly to the professor and try to work something out between the two of you.

,


Many new online schools with free classes are springing up all over the web. You can take classes from top universities, and some are even working towards offering certificates of completion.
You can learn all sorts of skills and topics, from history to computer programming.
Popular options include Coursera, CreativeLive, OpenCulture, or even Mental Floss' Youtube Series (featuring John Green!).
You can also learn languages online for free. Good sites include LiveMocha, Duolingo, and the Foreign Service Institute's online resources

,


You can teach yourself new skills and information as well. Humans learn by doing, so get out there and do!
You can teach yourself from books or other materials, or you can learn by really just doing things. Just make sure not to hurt yourself!
This can often take a lot of determination but you can do it! Don't give up!

,


You can also learn lots of skills and subjects just by talking with and learning from someone who is an expert. This is called apprenticing.
Find someone that does what you want to learn how to do, and offer to pay them or provide a free helping hand if they'll show you what to do.
This works better for skills than academic subjects, but you might still be able to find someone sympathetic enough to recommend some good books or other ways to learn.

,


It is important to get good grades in high school (or your country's equivalent), especially during the last two years. Colleges and universities will be looking at these grades to decide whether or not to let you in.
Get good grades by studying, paying attention in class, and doing all your work.
Get extra help from your teachers and communicate with them often if you want to help boost your grade.

,


Doing just the minimum isn't going to impress anyone, so get out there and put in some hard effort.
Take extra classes, audit classes at the local community college while you are still in high school, or work (either for money or volunteering) outside of school.
It will help you a lot if the extra work you do relates to the degree you want to get in college. This will look promising to colleges you apply to.

,


Speaking a language is not only helpful for you in your life, it also is often a requirement for degrees! Show a college that you're ready by learning a language.
You can take lessons privately, at your school, at a local college, or for free online! Good online options include LiveMocha and DuoLingo.
Choose a language that will be useful, as choosing an non-useful one doesn't really entice a college as much. Some languages are more useful than others in certain regions or for certain degrees.
Skills in 1 or 2 foreign languages may be helpful as well, in order to read older scientific papers that haven't been translated into English. The most helpful languages to learn include French, German, Spanish, Italian, Latin and Russian.
You may need to learn Arabic, Persian and Turkish. Many scientists and scholars have passed in Arabian Peninsula, Southeast Asia, Ottoman Empire and Persia (Present day Iran).

,


You will need to study psychology because you might have to deal with difficult people so by this you will understand people's nature.
By studying philosophy your mind capability will expand. You will be able to think a lot more than before.

,


Getting good SAT (or equivalent) scores will make a huge difference in what schools you are able to get in to. Get better scores to get in to better schools.
Get good scores by studying ahead of time (well in advance of your test date) and take practice tests.
You can also take the test more than once if you want to.
Don't feel like getting a bad or average score will keep you from doing the things you want. You can always start at one college and transfer to a better one.

,


Admissions essays are very important and can help you get in to colleges even if your grades or test scores are kind of average.
Get a read on the college to find out what they're looking for and then write something that caters to what they're looking for.
Set yourself apart, make your essay really unique, if you want to get in. Whether this is by doing something unconventional or just being academically outstanding depends on the college.

,


If you know what you want a degree in from the beginning of your time in college, this will help you a lot. Knowing what you want allows you to take only classes that will help you, rather than fluff classes that get you nowhere.
It's okay to change your mind of course, this can just really help.
Use your time in high school, if you can, to decide what you want to study and do with your life. Getting experience in that field by volunteering can really help you figure things out.

,


Study as much as you can and get good grades in order to get the most out of your time in college.
Taking notes and paying attention in class will go a long way towards helping you learn. Get good at these skills if you really want to succeed.
You can study on your own or with other people. Whatever works best for you. Working with others, however, allows you to take advantage of their notes.
Get help when you need it. You can ask your classmates, make use of the tutoring center, or you can get help from your professor or the TA.

,


Getting a degree involves taking the specific classes that a college requires for that degree. Make sure you're getting the right classes so that you can get your degree on time.
Look for classes that meet more than one requirement, in order to speed up the time that it takes you to graduate.
Try to take only classes that relate to your future career or degree. This will look better to and help get you ready for grad school.

,


Papers often play a big part in determining your grades, so writing great papers will of course help your grades. However, most graduate schools will require a sample paper when you apply. Having a stellar one on hand can play a huge role in getting in.
Read other good papers to get ideas on the best way to structure your paper, and how to present your evidence.
Shoot to be original. Original, significant research is what gets you noticed as a scholar.
Leave yourself plenty of time, so that you can have a draft ready to show the professor before the deadline and get feedback on it before turning it in.
Do more than one draft and make sure to do some great copyediting!

,


Befriending your professors is about more than getting a better grade because they like you more. You professors can often be your ticket into a good grad school, and they may be your colleagues later in your career.
Get to know them by taking advantage of office hours. However, be sure you aren't wasting their time. Come in with actual questions and pay attention to what they say.
You can also get to know your professors by being engaged in class. Sit near the front, answer and ask questions, and be good about participating in general.
You can also just talk to them and ask for advice. They want to see you succeed and should be more than happy to give you some pro tips about working and getting ahead in the field.

,


For some academics, a master's degree is enough to do what they want to do. Some will need to get a PhD.
This means that if you really want to spend the rest of your life as a scholar, you'll need to go to graduate school. Keep in mind that all of your schooling together can be 8 years or more after high school!
Doctoral programs take about 6 years to complete after obtaining a bachelor's degree. This may includes time used for earning a master's degree and completing a dissertation.
Don't get scared about this though. Graduate school is very different than normal school and, in some ways, it's easier. If you can get in, you can probably handle it.

, If you want a faculty position at a research-oriented or PhD-granting university, typically you will need to do at least one postdoctoral fellowship after completing your PhD. During this time, typically 2-4 yrs, you will need to publish as many papers as you can in the top ranked journals of your discipline.

,


The whole time that you are in school, you can take part in a wide variety of scholarly activities that excite your mind and let you have fun.
You can read for fun and explore your own research interests.
You can even do group activities, if you're more of a people person, like joining the debate team.

,


Once you've got your degrees, you'll want to find a teaching or research position in which to work. Teaching at universities is where most professional scholars end up.
Your college should have resources to help you find a job after you graduate.
Try to find positions with good benefits and pay, as you will likely have to pay back a large number of loans.
Try to get a position with a college or university, since you will have many resources available to you at institutions like this that you would not have elsewhere.

,


Most colleges and universities allow professors to work full time and earn tenure. Tenure provides those in the academic profession with some benefits, including protection from termination without due process or without cause.
Typically tenure at a top-ranked research institution requires some degree of demonstrable funding (especially in sciences and engineering disciplines) and a strong record of publications. There is also a 7-year trial period to determine whether you are eligible for tenure. Being a good teacher with an undistinguished research record will typically not get you tenure.
In sciences and engineering, starting assistant professors are typically given funds to build a lab, buy specialized equipment and supplies, and get their projects off the ground. This would usually be thought of by the junior faculty members as an investment that their university has made in them. They should try very hard to make good on this investment through securing their own funding, typically 2-3x their startup, before coming up for tenure.
As a professor, you'll be required to teach classes in your subject. Some will be closely related to the subject you study but some might be a bit of a stretch, especially when you're just starting out.
This means that you will have to talk in front of other people. Sometimes it will be a very large number of people, if you're teaching large freshman lecture classes.
Don't be intimidated though. You'll get practice in teaching classes while you are in graduate school, and your department should provide you with lots of help. Your students are also probably more nervous then you are, since they want you to give them good grades!

,


Real scholars spend their entire lives learning. Just because you finished school doesn't mean that you'll stop.
Continue to read in your spare time. This usually means reading academic journals, since this is where you'll be able to keep up with the latest developments in your field.
Travel to study in other countries. For many fields, it may be beneficial to take trips overseas, to see what your colleagues in other countries are working on or to gain access to materials that you may not have where you live.
Get other degrees. Sometimes scholars will go back to school and get degrees. This is often so that they can get further in their career, or if their research area overlaps with another field.

,


Conferences are special gatherings of lots of scholars in a particular field. They get together to present their research and learn from each other.
You may present things that you've been studying but mostly you'll listen to the presentations of others and talk with your colleagues.
Some conferences may be local or regional, but sometimes you may get to go to international conferences.
Believe us, conferences are more fun than what they sounds like. Realistically, most are just a bunch of scholars getting drunk together.

, You should be reading publications in your field every day -- which shouldn't be too difficult if you have a true passion for that area. (And if you don't, you may want to reconsider becoming a professor for that subject.)


You need to continually expand your specialized knowledge in that field if you want to become a good professor. Things can change from what's printed in the textbooks, and you want to be able to share that information with your students. It's better not to be one step behind your students and peers.
Networking with the experts in your field will also bolster your own research endeavors.
As George Bernard Shaw said: “If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea as well, and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.” Don't be scared of having your ideas stolen by others when you share it with them. Having people hear your ideas will spark criticism and contribution within them, only strengthening your own thoughts and counter-argumentation.

,


In Islam there are 5 levels of knowledge.

Silence
Listening with
Remembering what is heard
Practicing what you learned
Spreading the knowledge what you have got



,


When you work in academia, you will usually be required to continue researching in your field, writing papers and books at regular intervals.
Sometimes you will be allowed to take a sabbatical, or a paid, year-long break in order to work on your research.
You will write articles for journals, papers for conferences,and essays and books for publishing. The hope is that your original research will be significant enough to gain notoriety for the university you work for, attracting more students and grants.

Cataloging the museum's collections.
Assisting in the preservation of materials.
Delegating duties to other museum staff.
Managing the museum budget.
Giving talks or presentations to visitors.
Assessing new materials.;
, At the very least, you'll need a bachelor's degree in museum studies or a related field. Most curators have master's or even Ph.D. degrees. This amounts to several years of work, so make sure you're ready to make that kind of commitment., There are a multitude of different museums out there, all specializing in different topics. You may be interested in art, history, science, or sports. There are museums for all of these topics and more. When you decide what field you like, you can tailor your education and experience to that topic. Figuring this out early will make you a better job candidate and help you land the position you want.

, This is the minimum requirement you'll need for entry into the curating field.


Major in a field relevant to the type of museum you want to work in. Whether your interest is art history, anthropology, archaeology, etc., make sure you're educated in the field you want to specialize in.
Consider business or marketing electives. Curators are often involved in the business side of running a museum. Gaining some experience with these tasks will not only bolster your application, but will also help you make your museum successful., Although you may be able to enter the museum field with only a bachelor's, most curating positions require at least a master's degree.Look for a program that offers a degree for your interest. Narrow down your field to make it as specific as possible. For example, art history is a broad topic. Focusing on Renaissance Italian art with make you a specialist.
Look at the faculty at programs you're interested in. Confirm that there are professors who specialize in your field. This is important because you'll need an adviser to oversee your master's thesis.

, Meet all the degree requirements and write your master's thesis. Remember to make sure your thesis reflects your specialty. If you're looking to work in an American history museum, your thesis shouldn't be about medieval France.

, It can give you an edge on the job market to have two master's degrees: one in your field of study and one in museum studies. That way you can demonstrate that you have expertise in the museum's specialty and also know how museums work., While a master's degree will suffice for many museums, some larger museums require curatorial applicants to hold doctorates in a specific field. Investigate museums you would be interested in working in and see the degree requirements. If all your choices require Ph.D.'s, you'll have to continue your studies.Remember that a Ph.D. will require several more years of commitment. Confirm that this is still your preferred career before investing more time in your education.

, Education alone won't make you qualified to be a curator. Positions typically require several years of museum experience before applicants are even considered. Get ahead of the curve by getting museum experience as early as possible, ideally in college or even high school. That way, by the time you finish your education, you'll have years of experience under your belt to bolster your application.

, Many museums and historical societies offer internships for high school and college students. These are a great way to get experience and make contacts in the museum field.Do an internet search and see if museums or historical societies near you offer internships for students.
If you're in college or graduate school, visit your department office or the career center and ask if they have any information on internships. Many schools have partnerships with nearby institutions to offer credit for students who intern with them.
Remember at this early level, any experience is good for your resume. Don't pass up internship opportunities because they aren't strictly what you're interested in. You might even find a new interest you had not considered before.
Some degree programs require internships. If so, great, but you shouldn't wait for your school to make you do an internship.

, Even if institutions near you don't offer internships, most still need volunteers. There are a variety of jobs you can volunteer for and gain museum experience.

, It is very unlikely you'll come right out of school with a position as a curator. You'll probably have to work a number of jobs before becoming a curator. You can start as a research associate or cataloger as an entry into the museum profession. Then after a few years, you may be able to work your way up to a curator position.Don't be afraid to switch institutions. Many curators worked in a few museums before eventually rising to a curatorial position.

20 dried chestnuts
1 tablespoon salt
1/8 teaspoon Chinese five spice powder

10 dried black mushrooms, soaked with stems removed and caps sliced
20 bamboo leaves
1/2 pound pork belly, sliced

,
Add glutinous rice, mung beans and chestnuts to separate bowls.
,
Add enough warm water to cover the ingredients in the bowls.,
Drain the rice, mung beans and chestnuts before combining them in a large bowl.,
Add the salt and five-spice and stir to coat.
,
Soften mushrooms by pouring warm water over them.,
Discard the mushroom stems and thinly slice the mushroom caps.
,
Add bamboo leaves to a large pot.
,
Pour in enough water to cover.,
Pat bamboo leaves dry before using to make the ""tamales"".
,
Place 2 bamboo leaves, slightly overlapping, on a clean work surface.
,
Add about 1/3 cup of the rice mixture in the center.
,
Top each mound of rice with a slice of pork and 3 to 4 slices of mushrooms.
,
Cover with about 2 tablespoons of rice and the mung bean mixture.
,
Fold the leaves over the ""tamale"" filling to enclose the filling completely.
,
Use kitchen twine or string to secure the ""tamale"".
,
Place tamales in a large pot, pour in enough water to cover them, and bring to a boil.
,
Lower the heat and cook until the tamales are tender, about 4 to 5 hours.,

Separate the egg whites from the yolks.,
Beat the egg whites and sugar.,
Mix the egg yolks with sugar.,
Combine the egg mixtures.,
Add the rum, milk and cream.,
Whip the eggnog.,
Serve in clear glasses and top with whipped cream.",How to Make Eggnog2," Crack each egg in half over a bowl and gently transfer the yolk from shell to shell, letting the white drop into the bowl. Transfer the remaining yolks to a separate medium mixing bowl.


It's a good idea to separate the whites from one egg into a small bowl and, if the separation is a success (no yolk gets in), pour the whites from that egg into the large bowl. Repeat this process for each egg to minimize the risk of adding unseparated yolks or shell fragments to the main mixing bowl.
If you get yolk in the whites, save that egg for breakfast: whites will not whip when contaminated with egg yolk.

, Using an electric beater set on medium speed, beat the egg whites until they turn white and frothy. Add half the sugar and beat just until soft peaks begin to form.


You can technically use a whisk instead of an electric beater, but the process will take more time and energy.
""Soft peaks"" should just begin to hold their form when you remove the mixer, but they'll melt back into the whites after a second or two., Mix the remaining half of the sugar into the egg yolks in a separate bowl. Beat the mixture with a whisk until it is well blended.

, Gently fold the egg yolks into the beaten egg whites using a spatula, pouring slowly. The goal is to keep the fluffiness of the whites, which means you can stir too quickly or press too hard.

, Slowly pour the rum into the egg mixture, gently folding it in with your spatula. If you're serving the eggnog to children, you can leave out the alcohol. Next, add the milk and cream slowly to the bowl, gently stirring them in.


Start with 4 cups (1 L) of milk, then add more later to adjust the consistency. If you're adding alcohol, you may not need any more milk.
Some cooks recommend heating the milk and cream before adding to the egg mixture to help thicken and slightly cook the eggs. If you're worried about eating raw eggs, follow this step.
Taste the eggnog and decide whether to add more alcohol.
For thicker eggnog, reduce the amount of milk by half.

, Beat the reserved half of the cream in another medium bowl until nearly stiff, then gently fold the whipped cream into the mixture. Transfer the finished eggnog to a large punch bowl for serving.


Stiff peaks should be firm and should not collapse into themselves when you pull away the mixer., Grate or sprinkle some nutmeg on top for a pretty touch.


You can safely save leftovers in a sealed dish in the refrigerator for a few days or up to one week.

Blend the milk and ice.,
Mix the eggs, agave nectar and cinnamon.,
Blend the remaining ingredients.,
Serve the eggnog.",How to Make Eggnog3," Fill the blender half full with ice cubes. Pour in the almond milk. Blend the milk with the ice until it becomes smooth and frothy.Almond milk makes this version of eggnog appropriate for lactose intolerant guests.
If desired, you could swap the almond milk for soy milk, dairy milk, or other nut milks for a slight twist.

, In a separate bowl, mix the eggs and the agave nectar with a whisk, making sure they are well incorporated. Stir in the cinnamon.


Since you won't be able to heat this recipe, it's crucial to use pasteurized eggs to reduce the risk of foodborne illness.

, Pour the egg mixture, the cognac, the rum, and the cream sherry into the blender. Puree the ingredients until they reach a smooth consistency.


Skip the alcohol if serving this to minors or if you prefer non-alcoholic eggnog.

, Pour the eggnog into a glass and serve with a straw. This iced eggnog makes a delicious Christmastime treat when you're in the mood for something light and fresh.


It's best to enjoy this eggnog shortly after making it since the eggs are still raw, but you will likely be able to store it in a sealed container in your refrigerator for a few days if there are leftovers. Discard the eggnog if it takes on a strange odor or texture, however.

Use a different filling.,
Make a “snow skin” mooncake.,
Use a different mold.",How to Make Mooncakes2," There are many different types of ways that you can fill your mooncake. Besides the traditional mooncake, with lotus seed or red bean paste and a salted egg yolk in the middle, you can give these variations a try:


Five kernel filling, which consists of five different types of nuts and seeds, which can vary but can often include walnuts, pumpkin seeds, or peanuts
Jujube paste, which is a paste made from the jujube fruit
Mung bean paste or black bean potato paste
No egg in the middle, only filling like red bean paste
Fruit filling, such as melon, pineapple, and lychee.
Seafood (such as abalone or shark), This is a different way to make mooncake dough. You should mix together 100g of glutinous rice flour, 90g sweet icing, 30g shortening, and 50g cold water, adding the water gradually. You can also color this dough with food coloring, if you want to. This dough is different than normal mooncakes because they are softer, almost like mochi., You don’t have to use a traditional Chinese mooncake mold. You can find molds online or in cooking stores that have creative, modern patterns. You should also mold your mooncakes into different shapes to fit these different molds.

"
"
Put your mooncakes into an airtight container.,
Eat your mooncake with Chinese tea.,
Eat your mooncake as a dessert.,
Give your mooncake as a gift.",How to Make Mooncakes3," After your mooncakes have dried and cooled off on a wire cooling rack, you should put them in an airtight container. Wait to eat your mooncakes for one or two days. They should be soft and also look shiny on the outside., Mooncakes go especially well with tea. Try a vanilla tea with a little bit of spice for your traditional mooncake., Mooncakes are a sweet and decadent food, so you should eat them as a dessert. You can even cut them up into halves or smaller slices if they are too rich for eating in one sitting.

, It is common for mooncakes, even homemade ones, to be packaged in little boxes as gifts. Find some little boxes at a craft store or online, and put your mooncakes into boxes for your friends and family.

Pack your clothing.,
Recommended college clothing.,
Pack at least one versatile formal outfit.,
Take along sports clothing.,
Take helpful clothing care accessories.,
Put together the laundry essentials.",How to Pack for College1," Dorm rooms typically have limited space, and usually you cannot bring as much as you could fit in your childhood bedroom. Try to limit your clothing to three weeks worth of clothes suited to the season. Also, it makes moving out at the end of term much more manageable.

Focus on ways to make one piece of clothing work many ways. For instance, jeans that goes with nearly everything in your wardrobe is more desirable than a great pair of pants that really only goes with one shirt.
Travel packing advice is often a good source of information about maximizing a limited wardrobe.



 

;
, You are working with limited space, but also want to have a wardrobe ready for the freshman mixer, your internship, going to class, and so on. Here are some recommendations.

A tailored jacket (both for men and for women) will always be useful as it can serve both casual and dressed-up outfits. It looks polished, layers for warmth, and is more mature than a hoodie.






At a minimum, pack four base items (pants, capris, skirts, shorts), six tops that match at least three of the base items, three warm layers (a sweater, cardigan, blazer, thermal top, etc.), 1 dress (for women) and four pairs of shoes (three casual, one professional).






Use accessories to change the look of your clothes. Think wraps, scarves, ties, bags, belts, jewelry, etc. In this area women are more likely to have greater choices but both men and women can alter the look of an outfit with accessories.






Have a winter coat, but if possible, hold off on bulky winter items.Depending where you go to school, be prepared for unseasonably cold weather. But sweaters, thick sweatshirts, and the like take a lot of room. Many students chose to bring late summer items home during winter break and switch them for cold weather items.







, Although ideally this is one outfit, it may be two. Be sure one is more conservative (such as for a job interview) and the other outfit is for evening occasions (such as a date). You never know when you will have to dress up for a religious event with a new friend, go to a job or internship interview, or eat out at a fancy restaurant.

For women, consider a sheath dress, which can be ""dressed down"" for a date and with a nice blazer be ready for an interview. Another good combination is a skirt and formal top, which can be mixed and matched within your wardrobe.
Men should have one tailored pair of pants, one dress shirt and tie. All of these items also go well with other wardrobe pieces.







, Always include a swimsuit if you have one, whether or not you swim regularly. And take along whatever sports clothing you use regularly, whether athletic gear or team sports.


You may also want to consider bringing some sports equipment. Many colleges have great sporting facilities to use and intramural teams to play on. A tennis racket, football, or cleats may come in handy. Then again, it might be easier to wait until you're there and buy or hire equipment as you determine what sport you'll participate in.

, Investigating what will make the most of wardrobe space is never wasted time. Look for things like hanging shoe racks and pants hangers which accommodate five pairs of pants at a time. Vacuum bags can be a great way to store sweaters and other bulky winter items until needed later. And speaking of clothes hangers, make sure that the dorm room has some or be prepared to either take your own or purchase them when you arrive.

, Keeping clothing clean might not cross your mind when packing but it's one of the realities of college dormitory life! Here are some suggestions which you can pack or purchase on arrival:

Laundry detergent or the more portable detergent tablets. If you prefer eco-friendly or sensitive skin types of detergent, purchase these and label them clearly so that they don't get used by other people if you accidentally leave them behind.







Bleach, if you use it.






Dryer sheets. You do not likely have to pack them, as these are available at any grocery store.Again, if you use them. It's also possible to make your own.






A few rolls of quarters for the washing and drying machines. Quarters are in high demand on college campuses.






(Collapsible) laundry basket, laundry bag or pop-up hamper. If you decide to bring along a laundry bag, decide whether or not a mesh bag will be sturdy enough for the amount of laundry you use. Although strong enough for average loads of laundry, a large amount of clothing could rip the mesh. A thick cloth one could be a better alternative.






A dryer rack. Save money and energy air-drying clothing when possible.

Start a savings account.,
Earn money in high school.,
Consider your goals.",How to Afford Culinary School1," If the resources were available, your parents may have started a savings account for your education when you were young. You should use this money to help pay for culinary school. If you do not already have a savings account, start one and begin putting a little in it each month.If you have a job, consider putting 10% of your income into savings each month.
529 college savings plans are particularly popular because they defer taxes on savings if the student attends an eligible institution. Although some institutions may not be eligible, you can use your 529 plan to attend certain culinary schools.;
, In order to put more money in your culinary school savings account, you should consider working a part-time job while in high school. Working a job in the evenings and on the weekends can help you set aside a fair amount of money. Find something that looks interesting and fits your schedule.You can start your own business doing things like yard work, babysitting or dog-walking.
You could also consider working picking up a job as a waiter, lifeguard or laborer.

, As you are looking at schools, determine what it is you want out of the educational experience. You can attend a culinary school, which focuses strictly on the culinary arts or attend a college with a culinary program, where you will take culinary arts classes and classes outside of your major. Look at the expenses of the various schools that you are interested in and determine which one is the best educational and financial investment.Although a culinary school may be cheaper, it will largely only train you to work in the culinary arts.
If you change your career path, a degree from a four-year institution may help you find opportunities outside of the culinary arts.

Examine your qualifications and your reasoning.,
Examine your long term goals.,
Contact professors in the department that you are interested in.,
Tailor your application.,
Read about new concepts within your field.,
Research ways in which you can make the program suit you.,
Choose the right professor (for thesis-based programs).,
Check to see if there is a stipend for graduate students in your program.,
Apply for any scholarship or fellowship that you hear of.,
Apply for any teaching assistant positions that you are qualified for.,
Consider getting a part time job.,
Check to see if you have any untapped resources.,
Keep your stress under control.,
Pay attention to your physical health as you want to ensure that your graduate studies do not negatively impact you in a long term fashion.,
Always make sure that you factor in time to feed yourself nutritious and filling meals.",How to Prepare for Graduate School," Once you have completed a bachelor's degree, it is important to take a step back and assess your skill set. All graduate schools require that you can demonstrate your capacity for excelling in their specific program. Your qualifications may come in the form of: achieving stellar grades in relevant courses, publishing papers, experience doing a similar type of research, working in an industry similar to the program or obtaining awards in the field. Highlight your achievements and assess yourself to see what it is that sets you apart from other candidates to the graduate schools you have in mind.


Remember that a thesis based degree vastly differs from a course based degree. Both degrees require their own qualifications and will lead you down slightly different paths. It is important to study which programs you qualify for and which benefit you more wholesomely in the long term.;
, Your career path may not require a graduate degree and so it is important to truly assess if graduate school is an appropriate next-step for you. Obtaining a graduate degree requires substantial investment of both time and money which could potentially be more of use elsewhere.

, Their guidance may lead you to reflect on your own life goals and it may improve your reasoning for obtaining a graduate degree in their field. It will also give you an idea of what is required of students in your chosen field.


For thesis-based programs,  a supervisor is required and so this can be a good exercise in improving your personal network in your field. Don't be afraid of emailing professors or going to functions such as mixers or open houses to speak to them. Most professors are kind, professional and helpful people and they will respect your drive in achieving your goals.

, Every program will demand a slightly different skill set and it is important to highlight their requirements. If you are unsure of how to do so, speak to a friend in your field, a mentor or a professor who will be able to provide you with insight and feedback on your applications.

, While applying to your program, it is important to demonstrate that you are deeply involved with current research in your field. While this is not necessarily a requirement, it will improve your communication skills during interviews, conferences and meetings prior to being admit to your program of choice.

, Once admitted to the graduate program, it is important to finesse the program in a way that will suit your needs. This may entail choosing a professor whose research lines up with your dreams, picking the courses best suited for you or making a schedule that reflects your habits and skills. In some cases, it may also be the difference between choosing to obtain a master's or working towards obtaining a PhD instead. It is very important to study just how much wiggle room you have within your program as this could be the deciding factor between a mediocre experience and a fantastic experience.

, If you are part of a thesis based degree, it is important to examine the different professors available for you. While assessing them, consider:


Their type of research. There are multiple models used in research; from theoretical, to cell based to human and each one requires a different set of demands. Speak to the different professors and ask them for the pros and cons of working with their models. It is very possible that different methods will pique your interest. Examine what you would like to continue with during your graduate studies. Keep in mind that this may not necessarily be a model you are already trained to work with.
Their mentorship capabilities. Since professors are human, each one will behave in their own unique way. This is very often overlooked by students. Some professors are extremely hands-on in their approach and will guide you every step of the way, other professors take a hands-off approach and challenge you to overcome obstacles on your own. Both methods have their merits and it is very important to see what is the style of research that will best suit you. Examine your study habits in undergrad and high school: were you more likely to discuss problems with teachers and classmates or did you prefer to learn using books and published resources? While this may not necessarily predict your habits in graduate school, it can give you powerful insight on what you are most comfortable with.
Their history of publications. If you are interested in becoming a prominent researcher, examine their history of publication by checking online search engines such as NCBI and PubMed. While this does not perfectly predict their habit, it can give you insight on where they stand in their career. Is this professor a prominent figure? Is this professor finishing up their career or just starting out?
Other factors including their funding, their reputation, and their work.

, While this is not always the case, it will certainly help understanding your financial situation.

, A lot of the committees which distribute scholarships can overlook certain aspects of your application if they like something else. For example: if you barely meet the grades cut-off, but your project is excellent, you may have more of a chance than somebody who has amazing grades and a mediocre project.

, It is not necessary, but doing so will increase your experience working with students and it will also help you consolidate your knowledge of the program.

, This scenario may not be ideal for work heavy disciplines, but it is doable especially if you have excellent time management skills.

, Do you have family members willing to help you pay for your schooling? Do you have unused trinkets that you could sell? Do you have any money that is lying around?

, Mental health is a serious concern for graduate students as it is common for students to negatively react to very stressful situations. Always make sure that your mood is in check and seek help immediately if you feel that there is something wrong.

, Check to see if there is a gym available to students at your school. Consider walking a little bit to your place of work by getting off of transit a few stops early, parking further away than the allocated spot or adding frequent work out sessions during the week.

, Your work is not more important than your health as a sick person cannot operate optimally.


Consider downloading an app to catalogue your meals
Consider planning your meals during the weekend so you always know what to eat
Keep healthy snacks by your place of work so you can always manage to curb cravings
Drink plenty of water and avoid over-consumption of sugared beverages

Bring your bathroom items because there won't be any waiting for you.,
Bring two sets of bedding.",How to Pack for College2," Moreover, few colleges have personal bathrooms; on the whole, expect to share and be prepared to make it more bearable by having the right gear. As well as a shower tote, the following items are considered must-haves:

Bathrobe. You will likely have to walk a distance to the shower, often in areas like hallways. Bathrobes provide modesty, especially in co-ed dorms. Try to pick easy-to-pack robes in fabrics like flannel rather than bulky, fluffy robes in terrycloth.






Bath towels; bring at least three bath towels so you can wash one while you use the other, leaving an extra just-in-case or as a swim towel






A washcloth or shower pouf.






Shower shoes; rubber flip-flops work well; the floors of community showers can be really filthy, and walking barefoot on one is a certain way to get a fungal infection.






Suction hooks to hang your gear and clothes from––or, get portable, folding over-the-door hooks






Toothbrush case and teeth cleaning items like dental floss, toothbrushes, toothpaste, etc.






Soap case; keep your soap in a case; liquid shower gel is a nice alternative to bar soap, and it's easier to keep intact






Bar or shower soap, shampoo, conditioner, and any other shower items you use






Other toiletries you consider essential, such as sanitary ware, aftershave, deodorant, etc.







, This is just in case one gets dirty. If you like to read on your bed, a bolster or U-shaped cushion might be an added help to keep you propped up without causing back or neck strain.

"
"
Discuss with your roommate who will bring what essentials and electronics.,
Check with your school about what types of appliances are allowed.,
Consider bringing a portable Iron.,
Bring a small hair dryer.,
Along with the food appliances, you'll need a few basics like microwave-proof bowls, plates and mugs, utensils and sharp knife/cutting board, appliance-wiping gear, dish detergent, etc.,
Prepare other room supplies that will make life easier.,
Take along things that you feel will enhance how your room looks but still remain functional to both you and your roommate.",How to Pack for College3," No dorm needs more than one microwave, for example. After discussion, make sure you know if you should bring the microwave, hotpot, stereo, TV and mini-fridge you'll both want., Some have restrictions about wattage or types of mini fridges., Portable irons are smaller than full-sized irons, use less energy, and function just as well. Black & Decker X10 or X30 Travel Irons are among the best. Also consider bringing a mini ironing board, although you can either borrow someone else's or rig up alternatives such as a flat board on your bed.

, Another useful appliance is the hair dryer and there are some excellent small, portable brands that work as well as the larger versions.

, If you're going to be cleaning dishes outside of your dorm room, include a carrying bucket or similar. Other items possibly needed include:

An immersion heater
Water filtration pitcher
A garbage pail and trash bags
Plastic baggies––nice to package small odds and ends and foodstuffs in.
An all-purpose cleaner––there will undoubtedly be a lot to clean up at school, and an all-purpose cleaner is best because it can tackle multiple jobs.

, The items below are usually needed most but thought of least, and perhaps sometimes, not at all. They will make life easier, so consider them now:

Extension cords, cord organizer, cord cover and extra-long TV cable
Tools, such as a hammer and nails, pair of pliers, and both kinds of screwdrivers and screws; these should be the basic set of tools you bring
Scissors; you'll always need a pair
First aid kit; have the essentials available just in case. Include things like Band-Aids, ace-bandages, bandage tape, antibiotic ointment, and aspirin, etc.
A sewing kit; pre-made kits work well, but if you can't find one make sure to have a few colors of thread (black, white, other), a few needles in various sizes, and a small scissors
Hand vacuum/dust buster or small vacuum cleaner.
A fan; a window fan is a great idea for warmer months and will circulate the air best
A flashlight and a nightlight for reading books with––choose a clip-on or bookmark style night light for the least interruption to your roommate
Air freshener is a possibility; however, you should check and find out whether your roommate has asthma or any perfume or air freshener allergies––if so, use natural sources, such as making your own reed diffuser
Alarm clock, portable––look for the ones that include temperature and humidity readings; travel size is always much more convenient than large ones (and some even double up as a flashlight)
A hand truck and bungee cords
A college steamer trunk / footlocker / lock box. Lock boxes are essential since you no longer can keep everyone out of your room and from looking at and ""borrowing"" your things.

, A few functional luxuries can make life even more enjoyable. Here are some suggestions:

Area rug
Tree style floor lamp
Poster putty, mounting tape (or squares), and/or poster tape
Adhesive hooks
Full-length mirror
Plastic storage containers.

"
"
Bring things practical things to equip your dorm study area with.,
Don't be afraid to take too many things at the beginning if your parents are helping you move in.",How to Pack for College4," Some of these items might be better if they're purchased on arrival––check online for places that are close to campus where you could buy things from with ease. These items include:

A desk lamp. Look for one that can clip onto any surface, as this makes it practical for moving around as needed, such as having over your bed at night as well.
A bulletin board
A dry-erase marker board
A trash can (although check to see whether anything is supplied in-room)
An ergonomic desk chair seat pad or your own office chair. Pack a comfortable office chair, and send the standard chair home with your parents to bring back at the end of the year. Or, just bring a seat pad to make your chair a bit cushier
Take a computer. Frequent trips to the library are a hassle. While a desktop works fine, on the whole the portability of a laptop recommends itself most. You can take a self-assembled stand to raise the laptop to a good level on the desk. Also get a flash drive/memory stick for storage (essential for back-up). If you're buying a new computer, don't pay to have programs installed––most universities will give you Microsoft Office for free. Even if they don't, you can download Open Office, which is very similar, for free at www.openoffice.org.

, If you're provided with a desk lamp/trash can/etc., it's easier to send the one you brought back home with your parents than to go without."

Find out how you will be getting around campus.,
Work out your calling arrangements, and decide what options are cheapest.,
Be rain aware.,
Bring a digital camera.,
Bring a pocket map of the city you are moving to.",How to Pack for College5," If you're bringing a car, find out where to park and how much it will cost. You may just change your mind, depending on what you find out. If you won't be bringing a car, find out if you need another way to get around campus besides walking. Some campuses are too big to get from class to class without having a car, bike, skateboard, longboard, scooter, etc., although most probably provide some form of shuttle transport which you can avail yourself of.

, The following items depend on your phone plans, but you may want:


A cordless phone
A cell phone
Phone cards
Answering machine

, Have an umbrella and a good raincoat for those days when you need walk in the rain and keep your textbooks dry. If you're in an area with high rainfall, consider waterproof pants as well if you have to walk everywhere. Books can also be kept safe inside a watertight backpack., A lot of great memories will be made at college, and ten years from now you will be glad you brought a camera! If you don't have your own camera, and would rather not fork over the cash for one right now, get a few disposable cameras. They work just as well, although with the cost of getting films processed on top, you're probably likely to find a good digital camera on sale for the same end price.

, If you have a smartphone, iPad, eReader or similar portable electronic device though, simply download maps and carry them around with you at all times.

Research financial aid options.,
Complete the FAFSA.,
Look for grants and scholarships.,
Check out food service related scholarships.,
Take out a loan.,
Apply for work-study programs.,
Join the military.",How to Afford Culinary School2," Once you have determined what type of school you will be attending, you should look into what kind of aid you will be eligible for. There are many different kinds of state and federal aid available to students with financial need. Talk with a counselor at your school or a financial aid supervisor at the institution you are thinking about attending.You can ask your counselor things like “what financial aid do I qualify for?” or “how do I apply for financial aid?”
Financial aid can include scholarships, grants, and loans.

, The U.S. Department of Education offers a variety of financial aid options to students planning to get a post-secondary education. In order to qualify for this financial aid, you will need to complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This form takes into account your financial background to determine if you qualify for government assistance.You should complete the application the January before you start college.
Completing the FAFSA will help determine what types of federal grants and loans you qualify for.

, Grants and scholarships are basically monetary gifts that do not need to be repaid.Research and determine which scholarships and grants you may apply for. Many scholarships and grants are merit-based, so you will want to keep your grades up and be an active member of your community.


Depending on your background, you may qualify for federal Pell grants, which do not have to be repaid.Consult with your guidance counselor or a financial aid adviser at your prospective school.

, When looking for scholarships as a culinary student, your state’s restaurant association might be a good place to start your search. You may also want to see if you qualify for any scholarships from groups like the International Food Service Executives Association or the American Institute of Baking.Scholarships from these organizations can help you meet the cost of attending a four-year college or vocational school.

, Because of the high price, many people take out student loans to pay for their education. These can be federal or private loans. Federal loans tend to be a better option because they have lower interest rates, offer flexible repayment plans, and, in certain instances, allow loan forgiveness if you work a certain job.Consult with your counselor or a financial aid adviser.

, The Federal Work-Study program allows students to work part-time jobs in order to help pay for their education expenses. These programs often encourage students to work jobs that meet community needs or are related to their course of study. As a culinary student, you may find yourself working in a food service position on campus., Military service is another option to look into when considering how to pay for culinary school. The GI Bill, which helps pay for the educational expenses of active and former members of the U.S. military, can be used to pay for culinary school.In fact, the different military branches offer culinary arts programs that can prepare you for a career in the food service industry.If you are interested in being a culinary specialist in the U.S. Army, you will need to score at least an 85 on the Food Operators section of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB). Your scores on this exam help determine what role you will serve in the U.S. Army.

Find a roommate.,
Buy used books and supplies.,
Take advantage of student discounts.,
Use public transportation or ride a bike.,
Budget responsibly.",How to Afford Culinary School3," One way to save some money in college is to avoid living alone. Depending on where you live, a roommate can save you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in rent. If you are looking at culinary schools, this is particularly important because most institutes do not have student housing. Put up an add on Craigslist or in your local newspaper looking for a roommate, or use those services to find someone interested in a roommate.If you are in the same city as your parents, you might consider living with them.
Be wary of Craigslist postings and never go look at a place by yourself.

, Books and school supplies can be very expensive and cost a few thousand dollars a year. As a culinary student, you will want to look into buying used uniforms and equipment, which will be a large part of your student expenses. Also, in order to save some money, buy used books from your university bookstore or get them online.Check Craigslist for people looking to sell their used gear.
You could also contact students from the previous year and see if any of them are selling their stuff.

, Many businesses offer student discounts for their goods or services. These deals often include marked down prices simply by showing your student ID. Take advantage of these offers when you have the chance. You can often find these discounts at the beginning of the school year for various supplies and sometimes your books.There are often student discounts for more frivolous things like movies, concert tickets, and food.

, If you live in an area that has public transportation, take advantage of this service to get to school. This will save you money on gas and servicing your car. Some schools include free public transit passes with enrollment. If you own a bike, you might also consider biking to school. This is a cheap and healthy means of transport.If your city does not have good bike trails, be careful when cycling in traffic.

, The best way to make school more affordable is to budget wisely. If you create a budget and stick to it, you will be able to avoid having to use things like your credit card, which can quickly leave you in debt. When you start culinary school, write out all of your expenses and your income. Make a plan and stick to it.Be sure to pay your bills on time to avoid late fees and interest charges.

Use pomegranates to make cocktails or mock tails.,
Make a spread consisting of foods thought to bring good luck.,
Consider serving tapas.,
For dessert, serve Bundt cake or circular sweet treat.,
Let your guests know that it is important to leave a few morsels unfinished on their plates.",How to Make Brunch for New Year's Day," Don't start any earlier than 11:00am and keep the brunch running for several hours to allow people the chance to turn up when it's convenient. Consider having an open house for friends and family to drop by any time during a long, drawn out brunch.


Let every guest arriving know that this is a very casual, very comfortable affair. It's not about dressing up, just about catching up and sharing goodwill for the forthcoming year.
In contrast to Christmas preparations, the brunch should be a low-key affair, in which everyone can unwind and sloth about.;
, Keep some of the New Year's traditions in mind when setting the table for the event. Choose flowers that are thought to bring good luck, such as magnolias, irises, peonies, lotuses, chrysanthemums, and plum blossoms.

, The pomegranate has the meaning of abundance and for this reason, it is often included in the New Year's Day meals of Mediterranean countries. Other ways to enjoy pomegranates at your brunch include:


Pomegranate soup
Pomegranate mojito

White grape pomegranate juice.

, Drawing from a wide range of traditions concerned with luck, here are some suggestions for foods to use:


Cabbage – thought to represent money. For example, serve cabbage soup, coleslaw, stuffed cabbage, etc.
Lentils – thought to symbolize coins. For example, serve Lentil shepherd's pie, Spanish lentils and Puy lentils.
Pork – because pigs represent progress and a rich life. For example, serve Hawaiian pork chops, pork loin Parmesan and Downeast pork ribs.
Long noodles – thought to signify a long life. For example, serve Asian salmon noodles.
Collards – these represent dollars in the South of the USA. For example, serve African collard greens, collard greens Southern style and collard greens and ham in a crockpot.
Spring rolls – these are thought to look like gold bars. For example, serve crispy vegetable spring rolls, original spring rolls and spring rolls.

, Tapas portions can be an excellent way of providing a wider variety of food styles to suit everyone, that can be brought out continuously during the day. Better still, much of this can be bought or prepared the day before, letting you relax more as the host.


Some tapas ideas for you: chorizo and garbanzo tapas, caponata, patatas bravas and Spanish tortilla.

, The idea of a ring represents bringing closure to the year that has passed. You can even include a small trinket in the cake. The idea behind this is that the person who finds it is destined to have an especially fortunate year ahead. Some ideas include:


Strawberry bundt cake

Apple bundt cake.

, To this signifies having enough stocked in your pantry for the coming year.

Apply for a paid internship.,
Sign up for a work-abroad program.,
Apply for a work visa.",How to Make Money During a Semester Abroad1," While most internships are not paid, there are some that will give you a stipend to help pay your bills or offset the cost of traveling abroad. There are even internships that provide housing, which can be a huge help financially. These positions are usually highly sought after but are applied for just as unpaid internships are, so if you are highly qualified a paid internship may be right for you.If you are interested in getting a paid internship you will need to find some to apply for. You can do an internet search for internships that are available to you but you may also be able to consult with your school's study abroad program to see if they know of any that are available.
A paid internship may require a work visa, but these programs usually make that arrangement.;
, If you do not have the financial ability to pay for a traditional study abroad program, you may be able to find a work abroad program instead. These programs are usually seasonal, so they can be great for making money and getting an experience abroad during summer break.Some common jobs that are offered in a work abroad program include being an au pair or teaching English.A work-abroad program will require a work visa but programs designed for foreigners usually make those arrangements.

, There are some countries that will allow you to work while studying abroad if you apply for a work visa. Whether or not you are granted a work visa will depend on the country you are going to, the study program you are doing, and the length of time you are staying, which in most cases needs to be at least six months. Some countries that do grant work visas include the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, France, Germany, and Spain. However, there are a lot of limitations placed on the amount and type of work you can do while a study abroad student.
Work visas require a fee and an application process. Do some research about how much a work visa costs in the country you are going to and assess whether you meet their requirements. For instance, in the UK you will need to pay a fee of £328 to apply for a Tier 4 student visa. In the application you will need to guarantee that you can write, read, and speak english, that you can afford to stay in the country without a job, and that you are enrolled in approved courses.Once you get a work visa, you will still need to apply for and get a job once you are abroad.

Submit all final transcripts and any other forms (e.g.",How to Get Into Graduate School," This comes before getting good grades and may in fact be more important. You should pick classes that will impress graduate schools. This means choosing classes that are relevant to your field of interest and that are high level or challenging.


Complete required courses as early as possible. Undergraduate programs typically have ""core"" requirements within majors and some graduate programs (e.g. medical school) have strict undergraduate course requirements to get in. Getting the basic required courses done in the beginning will avoid schedule conflicts later and allow you to take more advanced classes.
When choosing electives, try to create a theme. Even if you do not have an official minor or double major (either of which can be helpful!) it's good to have organization to your electives. You should be able to describe how the knowledge you gain in these classes will benefit you in graduate school. Some people advise choosing directly related subjects for electives (e.g. a computer science major might take courses in mathematics) while others advise taking something very different (e.g. a computer science major might take courses in English so that they stand out from the general applicant pool). The important thing is to have good reasoning for how these courses benefited you. Having a general theme will make it easier to do this.;
, This is arguably the most important step. A good letter of recommendation can make all of the difference, and this is the step that people too often put off until it is too late. Cultivating a relationship with people in your field will help you immensely in the graduate school application process. Reaching out will likely also enrich your academic experience (and enhance your grade!). You don't have to be that kid who is always raising their hand in class (no shame in that though) to have a good relationship with a professor.


Go to each of your professor's office hours at least once. If your professor doesn't have open office hours set-up, introduce yourself at some point after class. Make sure you have something to talk about-asking questions about the course material, possible directions or careers in your field, or the professor's research works great. It does not have to be a long of formal meeting, this is just so that they know your name and face. It also gives you an opportunity to assess if this is someone you want to maintain a relationship with. If not, you don't ever have to meet with them again. However, people are often surprised to find that professors appear and act differently in a one-on-one meeting and are usually eager to interact with and help students.
Get involved in the department. University departments often host events or get togethers with other students and professors. Try out at least one. It's an easy way to help people remember who you are and for you to make a good impression. Other ways to get involved could be as a tutor or a teaching assistant in the department.
When you find a professor you like, continue to reach out to them. Ask them questions, discuss your intentions to pursue graduate school, ask them about research opportunities. And yes, a little sucking-up can be helpful. The more often you show up early, raise your hand, and go above and beyond on assignments, the more they will be able to write in your letters of reference later.

, Getting excellent grades will obviously put you in a better position when applying to graduate school. However, it is listed third because doing the above two steps is arguably more important, and both will typically improve your grades.

, Often graduate schools are looking specifically for research experience. This is where your relationships with professors will come in handy. However, if you are unable to secure a research position at some point, try to get jobs or internships in relevant positions. Don't despair if you do not get a competitive job in your field. At the end of the day it is all about how you spin your experience. Make a note of skills you gained at jobs or times you showed good qualities while working to use in your graduate school letter of intention. Take your work seriously-even if it is in the wrong field. You never know when you will need a good reference!

, The graduate admission process places less emphasis on the ""well-rounded"" candidate than the undergraduate admission process, but it is still good proof that you weren't spending all your free time partying. You may also be able to use it to bolster your resume and letter of intention.

, Deciding this early on will help you immensely in staying organized and not missing an opportunity just because of a missed deadline. A good rule of thumb for choosing schools is to have two back-up schools (schools you are almost certain you will get into), two ""on target"" school (schools where you think you are right at/in the middle of the admission criterion) and two ""reach schools"" (competitive schools where, realistically, you might not make the cut). If you'd rather take a year off to work or do research than go to a ""lower-level"" graduate school, you can save some money by not applying to back-up schools.


Keep in mind that the applications and sending test scores are expensive! At this point, it would probably be a good idea to ask your professors about the schools you are considering. They usually have a good idea of the quality of programs at other schools and what type of experience you will get there. They may know things not advertised by the school, like that they are only interested in people looking to enter academia. They will also have a good sense of how students from your school do when applying to graduate school, and can help you make realistic choices.

, Things to consider when making your decision:


Your interests. This is especially important if you are looking to apply to a PhD or other research based program. Look into work that has been produced in recent years by the schools you are interested in, browse the professors' websites and their interests. If nothing the department is doing excites you, you should look elsewhere.
Financials. Does the school provide funding or support for your program? What is the cost of living where the school is located? Will there be dorms?
Size of the program.
Length of the program.
Program structure. Is it all courses? Mostly research? Thesis optional? Opportunities for work training?
Geographic location. This is one of those things that people sometimes downplay too much but you should be honest with yourself about where you would and would not be willing to study. Maybe you need to stay on the West coast to be near a partner or maybe you are only willing to go to school in a city. If you program is only a year or so, it's more advisable to put less weight on this but for a longer program this could be a major factor in your happiness and therefore success. Besides your preferences, there may be reasons to go or avoid going abroad. For instance, in Canada and other countries it is common for masters students to receive funding-something unheard of in the US. On the other hand, completing a medical degree outside the country you intend to practice in can be extremely detrimental.
Researchers or professors who you may want to work with. Applicants often plan too far ahead with who they will or will not work with in graduate studies. The truth is, students often find that personalities end up clashing unexpectedly or their own interests change. However, knowing that there are at least 2 people doing research in an area of your interest at any school you are applying to is important.
Prestige or ranking of the school/department. Too much emphasis is often put on this as rankings are typically variant and unreliable. Still, nobody was ever hurt by graduating from an Ivy League school.

, Many looking to apply to graduate school skip this step. Some because it seems like too much extra work on top of all the other graduate school application mayhem, some because the rejection rates are high for incoming students, some because they do not have a research proposal ready. However, even if you do not win an award, applying can be beneficial. On graduate school applications they always ask if you have applied for any scholarships. Typically, the school actually makes acceptance decisions before you hear back from these scholarships/grants. That means that all they really want to know is, did you put in some effort to get funding.


External funding can save the school or department money, making you more valuable. Many of the pieces of scholarship and grant applications are things that you need to prepare for graduate school applications (e.g. CV, personal statement, recommenders,transcript). Even if you do not have a stellar research proposal, you will at least gain some experience in writing a proposal.

, Put all of the deadlines for the schools and scholarships you are applying to in your calendar. This includes when test scores and transcripts must be sent by, when recommendations must be received, and when all final application materials are due.


Make a list, organized by school/scholarship or required materials. There are many variations in application requirements between school from length and content of personal statement to`required test scores.

, Make sure that you are done with the GRE, MCAT, GMAT, LSAT, etc. For some tests, such as the MCAT, it is recommended to actually take the test earlier, before your third year of university. For other exams, taking them by the end of the summer before you apply to graduate school will give you a small buffer zone where you may be able to retake the exam in early fall to get a better score in time. Keep in mind that seats in these exams sometimes fill up quickly-book well in advanced!

, This is where those relationships you built with your professors will come in handy. For most masters and PhD programs, having professors as your recommenders is ideal. For some programs, such as business school, it may be more beneficial to have at least one work-related reference. The most important thing is that the recommenders bare people who actually know who you are. You might have got an A in Organic Chemistry, but if the professor doesn't even know your name, they can't write you a good recommendation.


Remember that the school you are applying to will get hundreds of applications-they can tell the generic ones from the ones with personality. It helps if your recommender is someone well known in the field-but only if they know you and will put in the effort to help you! It is generally not advisable to ask a TA or other student for a recommendation (the graduate school will have no idea who they are!). If you know your TA well but not the professor, consider asking them to co-write a letter with the professor that is signed by both of them. The same thing applies for faculty members who do not hold professor positions-sadly the university you are applying to may not recognize them or give them credibility.

, Doing this in the summer or September ensures that your recommenders will have plenty of time to write your letter, and you won't be asking them in October-December when many other students will likely ask. They will appreciate your politeness and advanced warning-just make sure to keep reminding them as the deadlines get closer. Some professors strongly prefer students to ask them in person though many don't care if they are asked over email. You should know your relationship with your recommenders will enough to gauge which is more appropriate. An easy and natural way to ask them is to ask for a meeting to discuss graduate school. After seeking advice on where and how to apply, asking for a letter is very simple.


Never ask a someone for a recommendation in front of others, it can make them uncomfortable or put them on the spot. A polite way to ask for a recommendation is ""Would you be willing to write me a strong recommendation?"" Phrasing it this way will give the person an option to decline if they don't really feel like they can write you a strong recommendation. A graduate school receiving a weak or generic letter of recommendation will be able to see right through it. Don't worry though, most people are happy to help students as they have likely been helped themselves!
Recommenders will appreciate you being able to give them a list of schools and scholarships you will need for them to write recommendations for (though it's fine if this changes a little with time). You should also ask if your referees would like anything from you. Sometimes they want a list of your accomplishments or interests to help make your letter more personal.
Offer to give any additional information they require. Giving your recommenders your resume and a list of things you think they did well in their class, at your job, etc. can help them write a stronger, more personal recommendation

, You may need more than one of these or different variants depending on the requirements for different schools (or grants/scholarships).


Make some bullet points for why you want to go to graduate school and why you are passionate about the field you are in.
Make a list of qualities that you think you have shown and that you believe graduate schools will be interested in. For instance, hard-working, goal-oriented, self-motivated, independent, passionate...
Make a list of things that you have done related to the field you wish to go into. From courses, to jobs, this will also help when creating your resume/CV.
Make a list of your accomplishments. Now is not the time to be modest, think of every award you have won, every competitive position you have been given.
Make a list of any other activities or events that may interest an admissions committee.

, There are many possible ways to write a graduate school statement. Look online for some inspiration and to get a sense of the different styles. How you write your statement should depend on how you think you can write most strongly and portray yourself in the best light. You should emphasize the first two bullets above, while showcasing the other three. For instance, people often start with a ""hook"" or anecdote about why they are passionate about the field. Creating a ""theme"" to your statement by choosing one of the items from the list in the second bullet, will help make you memorable.


Write a first draft.
Edit it yourself. Printing out the statement and marking it up on paper is often more helpful than re-reading it on your computer.
Have others read it. If your university has a writing center that you can seek help at, do! If not, consider switching statements with another friend who is applying to graduate school or asking someone else in the field to read your letter. Hearing someone's reaction to your statement can be invaluable.
Re-read your statement at least once a week until the deadline.

, This is more important for programs that require you to be admitted with an advisor or lab group. Some universities actually strongly discourage you from reaching out to individual professors. Look on the department's website for information for graduate school applicants to see if they have a policy on this. It is always a good idea to reach out to people you may want to work with in the future but if you aren't sure who to contact, the graduate chair is usually a safe bet. You should explain that you are applying to graduate school, that you are very excited about the opportunities available at their university, and think of a few questions to ask.


In many universities the acceptances are put to a vote by faculty, so having someone already familiar with your name is beneficial. If you need to be accepted to a research group for admittance to the program, more consideration and discussion will be necessary at this stage.

, Make sure it is up to date and formatted correctly. Have at least one other person look over it for formatting and possible typos.

, Typically an unofficial pdf version of your transcript can be used for the application, but ensure that this is true for all of your applications before submitting.

, This is very important to get a sense of the culture in the department and the structure.

, Students are often given contacts in the universities that they are accepted to, but don't always take advantage of them. Getting perspectives from within the department is very important so don't be afraid to ask a lot of questions! Some good questions for current graduates students might be:


What is the course load like?
How important is the research component in your first year?
Are you friends with others in the department or is it a competitive atmosphere?
Do you need to come in with an advisor or research topic in mind?
Does the department put a preference on whether students remain in academia after the program?

, This is one of the hardest steps, especially if you end up with many good options. The same considerations as in your decision to apply to graduate school should be made again. Often people feel after visiting schools that one is a better ""fit"" for them. Continue talking to the schools and people who have supported you in this process until you are ready to make a decision.


Although it is kind to decline offers that you are not seriously considering early to allow people off of the wait list, don't feel bad about taking your time! No matter what decision you end up with, you should feel proud. You made it

, medical documents) that the school requires. Congratulations-you have now gotten in to graduate school!

This degree should demonstrate your potential for both advanced coursework and independent research. In general, you need to maintain a high GPA and develop a good working relationship with your instructors.


Generally, it's recommended that students interested in pursuing advanced degrees should develop a wide skill-base during their undergrad. In other words, while you may ultimately be interested in studying Zoology, an undergrad degree in basic Biology might provide you with a diverse base that you'll be able to narrow in your future studies.
Many universities offer majors designed to funnel you into an advanced degree. Pre-law majors and Pre-med majors are two notable examples of this. Talk to your academic advisor about your interest in pursuing a PhD after you graduate, if you've yet to select a major.;
, Finding one or more faculty members who will mentor you, guide your development, and assist you in finding the right program for you can be the difference between finding your way into a good Ph.D program, and struggling. You'll also need several letters of recommendation to apply to graduate programs, making these contacts essential.

A good way to develop a relationship with a professor is to take multiple classes with her and join her lab, or research team. Go to office hours, introduce yourself, and express your interest in advanced degree work. Most professors are more than happy to work with a talented student who shows a sincere interest in their work.
It's also a good idea to forge relationships with graduate students at your school. Speak to graduate students and faculty about their experiences at the school, even if you plan on going elsewhere for your advanced degree. Many will be happy to let you know about the advantages and disadvantages of studying for and obtaining a Ph.D. It can be a great way to get insider information and get ahead of the game.

, In many fields, hard science in particular, securing a summer internship as an undergrad can do a lot to make you stand out on your applications. If you can get experience assisting in the biology lab, or doing field work with the other geologists, or even assisting a professor grade survey-course tests, you'll be one step ahead in the academic field.


Work-study programs in your field of interest can also be extremely attractive of graduate applications. If you're studying English, try to secure employment in the Writing Lab, rather than the cafeteria to give yourself an edge and valuable experience.

, Become involved in your academic department's club or honor society if one exists. If not, speak with your advisor or department chair about starting one.


National and regional conferences, such as the National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR), allow dedicated undergrads the opportunity to rub elbows with experts and contribute to the discussion.

, Graduate school applications will be due sometime during the winter or spring of the academic year, for admittance the following fall semester. In other words, the autumn semester of your senior year is most likely too late to start looking at programs, compiling your application materials, and getting them in on time. Start early and don't miss out.


Look for programs with a good reputation, but give more weight to the faculty and the research interests of the other graduate students at prospective schools. What you're looking for in an advanced degree program is camaraderie and common ground, not an arbitrary ranking on some ""prestigious"" list.
The applications are expensive--sometimes $50 or $80 dollars each--so you won't be able to apply to all programs. Try to select a range of programs to apply to: choose a few big dream schools with great facilities and prestigious faculty and lots of competition to see if you can't get in. Apply to smaller programs that you'd also be happy attending. Apply to as many as you can afford to give yourself the best chance.
For some fields, a master's degree will be a more appropriate subsidiary or even terminal degree. At worst, a master's degree can be an excellent primer for the graduate school life, especially if teaching assistantships or fellowships are available.

, Many programs require scores from the GRE to admit you to the graduate school, while others (many liberal arts degrees) will waive this requirement.


While most Master's programs only require the general test, which is like an advanced version of the SAT, some Ph.D programs will require that you take the subject test, which is given in several sections, including biology, literature, and other fields. It's a much more difficult test than the general--the reading list for the Subject test in lit is several hundred authors from a variety of periods. Make sure you take the correct test for the program to which you're applying.Schedule your test early in the application season, to give yourself enough time to retake it, if necessary. The test can be somewhat expensive, more than $100, so start studying now with a good-quality commercial study guide.
When you arrive for the test, you can arrange to have your scores sent directly to the graduate programs you'll be applying to. This has the advantage of cutting out an extra step in your application process, but also ensures that the school will see your scores, good or bad. If you're worried about your score, arrange to have them sent to you instead.

, The best recommenders will be distinguished former professors, contacts who can attest to your commitment, work ethic, and who also know the field you're applying to intimately. Often, your undergraduate and graduate professors and advisers will have a better handle on the specific information the admissions committee wants than would a supervisor from outside the academic world.


It's important to ask for these letters as early as possible, preferably at least 3 months before you need to submit your applications. Professors will be inundated with letter-writing requests at the last minute, increasing the possibility of them writing a poor evaluation. Don't be one of those students.

, This should describe what you have already done in your field and what you hope to accomplish with your doctoral research. Good letters will describe who you hope to work with as your research supervisor and the reasons you want to work with that person. Your research program should be in an area that has not been previously researched, or has been underrepresented in the literature.


If you're planning on applying to lots of schools, it can be a time-saver to write a ""form"" version of your letter, allowing space to customize the letter for more specific programs. It's very important to tailor each statement of purpose to the particular program to which you're applying. This demonstrates your seriousness and interest in the school. Each letter should read as if you're only interested in studying at that school.

, The graduate school will list the basic requirements for admission, and each program will likely list supplementary documents, including writing samples, portfolios, or other materials that you should submit to the program by a particular deadline. Look for this information on the graduate studies website for the particular university. Most application packets require the following materials:


a completed application form
Undergraduate and graduate transcripts
A curriculum vitae (CV) or resume
Recent GRE scores
Statement of Purpose
TOEFL or IELTS scores (for international students)
2-3 Letters of Recommendation

, A general rule of thumb is that advanced degrees should always be free. When you're doing your research, apply to programs that offer full funding, or at least offer opportunities to secure funding in exchange for teaching responsibilities. Most Ph.D programs offer some kind of assistantship to pay your way through the years of your doctoral program, with the added option of research assistantships directly tied to your own research.


Applying for financial aid will often involve supplementary application materials, like a teaching statement, research statement, or other short writing prompts. Research the specific requirements at each university for specific instructions when applying for financial aid.
If full funding isn't an option, consider applying for need-based scholarships. Often, these are available to minority applicants or students in financial straits. Likewise, the application fee can often be waived. Contact individual departments when you're applying to check about need-based application waivers.

, You want an advisor familiar with your area of research who can direct you when needed and have resources and connections you can draw on. Tenured professors have access to more grant money, equipment, and connections, while non-tenured professors are more personally available for assistance and advice.


Choose people who you can work with, and who share a common research interest, as well as people you get along with personally. Personal differences often pop up during these kinds of working relationships, making it important to avoid them in the beginning.
Your proposed academic advisor/research supervisor should ideally be named in your statement of purpose, with the reasons you want to work with that person. Those reasons should show that you know something about that person's background and why he or she would make an effective advisor.

, For most fields, a plan of study is submitted to the graduate school and the degree program within the first year of your studies. The plan with be submitted to the Department Chair, who will either accept it as is or suggest revisions. Obtain the Plan of Study form from the graduate school office, if one is provided. The form needs to include:



The names and signatures of your committee members, the program director, and the student. You'll also need your student ID number and other personal information.

A brief statement of your academic and research goals. This will typically be a super-condensed version of your research question or thesis statement, probably no more than 50-100 words.

A list of the required courses you'll take over the next two years, listing course number, title, department, and instructor, as well as the semester you intend to take the course. Most programs require around 12 hours of required coursework for an advanced degree.

A list of the elective courses you'll take, with corresponding course numbers, titles, departments, and instructors, as well as the semester you intend to take the course. Most programs require somewhere between 20 and 30 elective hours for an advanced degree.

Dissertation hours. When you've passed your preliminary examinations, your coursework will change to independent research and dissertation work, but you'll still be registered for a course with a course number and a particular number of credit hours, with your major professor or thesis chair as the instructor. This information will also need to be included on the plan of study form.

, Most programs require somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 hours of departmental coursework, while others require more or less, depending on the field. As with most advanced degrees, you'll likely need to pass all your courses with at least a B, or better.


In graduate school, the course load is usually somewhat less than the undergraduate degree, because of the intensity of the coursework and other research or teaching responsibilities. A ""full load"" is usually considered 6 or 9 hours, though you'll be doing 20 or more hours of teaching or research in a given week.For a PhD student, a typical coursework semester might involve three courses: a required core class and two elective courses. Typically, elective courses will still be in the department the student is studying, if not the particular program. For example, a comparative lit PhD studying Medieval literature may take a 20th century poetry course in the English department as an elective, though probably not a biology class.

, Typically, this will occur sometime at the end of your second year of course work, and will be prepared by your committee. The content of the written examination will depend not only on your field of study, but on your particular research interests and academic needs. Think of it as a test particularly tailored to you.


The written examination, sometimes called the ""prelim,"" will typically be submitted to the department chair by your major professor, then administered to you toward the end of your second year of classes. When you pass the exam, you'll be considered ""Post-Prelim"" and may begin the process of completing your dissertation., The goal of the PhD is to complete independent research. It's your first chance to be an academic pioneer, exploring an untapped field, researching new layers of a particular topic, and putting your stamp on the conversation happening in your field. It's also a great opportunity to get deep into a topic that excites and interests you. Choose a research topic that gives you genuine pleasure, and choose something that you're willing to spend several years exploring.Start with a research question. A research question is what you'll hope to answer over the course of your dissertation research. It needs to be narrow, but with broad-reaching implications. A starting research question might be something like, ""How are women represented during the silver age of American comic book publishing?"" or ""What are the implications of spontaneous genetic mutation during breeding in drosophila, and what effect might this have on cancer research?""

, A large part of your research process should be devoted to exploring the conversation that's already happened around your topic. You need to perform literature reviews to find out what experiments have been performed breeding drosophilae, and what has been written about women in silver age comics. Find an unexplored angle or aspect of the research.

, When you find out that, despite the interesting observations of some researchers, a compelling connection doesn't exist yet between drosophilae and on-going attempts to mutate cancer cells, you may well have found an avenue for your experiments. If the critical literature is significantly silent on the topic of Wonder Woman, you've got something to write about.


As you complete your coursework and add complexity to the topic in which you're interested, you'll likely change and add depth to your initial research interest. That's fine. Let the research grow you understanding of the topic, and change the way you approach it. That means you're on the right track.

, Your doctoral dissertation is the written culmination of your research interests, to be completed over the course of multiple research semesters. The dissertation should provide the answer to the research question you set out to explore. These are typically book-length projects that will need to be submitted to your committee, defended orally, and approved to be awarded your doctorate.



In the humanities, several semesters following your coursework and preliminary examination will be devoted to completing the research involved with your interests. During this time, you'll be expected to periodically update your committee on your progress, providing them with literature reviews and outlines, depending on your arrangement. You may also be expected to publish supplementary papers periodically in academic journals.

In the sciences, you'll spend your post-prelim semesters doing lab work, or other field work depending on your field of study. The time will be spent collecting data and performing experiments to move your research forward, to be collected in the dissertation, and probably published in peer-reviewed journals.

, After you've written and submitted a dissertation to your committee, you'll be expected to defend it in a semi-public forum. This usually takes the form of an interview-style question-and-answer session, though you'll generally be privy to the questions your committee will ask.


Most ""defenses"" are cordial affairs, not debates, though you should expect to be pressed and argued with regarding your methods, your conclusions, and other aspects of your work. The best way to prepare for your defense is to know your dissertation and your research inside and out.
At a successful defense, you'll need to present yourself and your work well both orally and in writing to earn recognition as a PhD candidate and a researcher. Practice delivering your main point quickly and your overall presentation or paper with confidence.

, Many PhD programs will fully fund every student admitted into the program, through some combination of teaching responsibilities or research assistance completed in conjunction with the coursework. ""Full funding"" means that any tuition fees will be waived, and you'll be awarded a stipend to cover your living expenses, anywhere between $13,000 and $30,000, depending on the location of the school and the nature of the program. Other programs assist students on a case-by-case level, meaning that you'll need to take funding into your own hands and make sure that your place in the department is financially secure.



In the hard sciences, money is allocated to provide different labs, projects, and individuals money on a competitive case-by-case basis. To apply, you'll typically write a detailed proposal of your research goals and submit it to the department.

In the humanities, it's also common to seek subsequent teaching appointments in tangential fields: if your research involves the representation of women in comic books, and you've been teaching in the English department, why not pick up a special-topics course in Women's Studies?

, Most departments acquire funding from a variety of sources, public and private, and it's common to bypass the department and go outside if you've got a particularly-attractive research topic. The Whitehall Foundation commonly provides research grants to scientists, while the NEA and the Poetry Foundation offer a variety of grant funds to artists and writers. Talk to your major professor about applying for private money.

, Increasingly, academics are taking their projects to the people, especially for innovative research topics. If you're pioneering a new approach to artificial intelligence, or another flashy topic that'll look good in a 2 minute video, start a kickstarter, Rockethub, or Petridish.org profile to take your research to the people and work outside the institution., While getting $13,000 dollars for attending school may sound like a lot of money, keep in mind that you'll probably be working in excess of 40 hours a week, attending courses full time, and covering your own rent, food costs, and other expenses. Likewise, many PhD programs only fund during the school year, making part-time employment a common occurrence among PhD students, especially during the summer months.

, Academic departments can be competitive and cut-throat environments. With everyone competing for the same grants, awards, and respect, it can get ugly fast. Try your best to stay out of departmental politics, and make an active effort to reach out to others and collaborate. Put your head down and do your work. No matter how smart you may be, how great a teacher, or researcher, you will need the help of others in your research.

, While your research and dissertation are your primary focus during your doctoral studies, make sure you've developed a healthy balance between all your responsibilities. If you've never taught before, it can be difficult to find the time to spend on completing the research you want to complete, when you've got a stack of fifty papers to grade, lesson plans to prepare, and a student in tears at your office door.


Don't Try to do everything at once. Because you will spend several years to earn your doctorate, it's important to slow down and do everything with the attention to detail the process deserves. You don't want to get your dissertation hung up because of a silly documentation error you rushed through.

, The average PhD takes between 5 and 10 years to complete. You have to be prepared to commit the time and energy, throwing yourself into the deep end of the academic pool. It's not something to rush through, but it is your chance to put your stamp on the field that's captivated you.

During the time you spend working on your doctorate, you'll face a variety of challenges. The lab's funding may be cut. You may lose grant money. Your paper may get rejected from a conference. Fail early and fail often. Create opportunities for yourself and work around the challenges.

, Despite the reputation of academics as absent-minded Professors, getting a PhD takes an ordered mind. Learn to prioritize tasks and relegate less-critical chores until later. Do one thing at a time. Break large jobs down into smaller manageable tasks that you can complete and move on.

Consider your personal characteristics.,
Consider your home environment in general.,
Identify your goals.",How to Know if an Online Degree Is Right for You2," Being successful in getting a degree online requires certain skills and characteristics. The following characteristics are helpful in knowing whether pursuing an online degree will suit you:Self-discipline: Since an online degree requires that students attend class on their schedule, it takes some degree of self-discipline to obtain an online degree. If you're the type of person who needs someone else to be accountable to in order to get things done, an online degree may not be right for you. On the other hand, if you're happy organizing your schedule, getting on with regular studying and meeting deadlines, it's likely to work well for you.
Reading comprehension: Without traditional classes, lectures go out the window. Online programs require you to read the lectures. If your reading comprehension is not that great, you may want to consider traditional classes over online ones. You may find more video lectures accompany many courses online though; ask what the mix is and decide if that works for you.
Writing skills: Online classes require students to communicate with each other and with professors mostly in writing. If your writing skills are not so great, you may find online classes more difficult than traditional face-to-face classes. However, this is a great opportunity to improve them too, so don't use this as a barrier to getting started.
Computer skills: Taking classes online means you will be on the computer for much of your day. You will need to be proficient using email and the internet and will have to learn how to use your school’s online software. Usually there will be clear instructions for using the software and a contact person should you run into problems.







, If you're studying online, how will this impact others in your household? Will they be accommodating or supportive? It can be helpful to explain to them that even though you're not going to a college physically, you're still working just as hard (if not harder) to obtain your degree and that you'll need space and peace at certain times of the day in order to study. Consider carefully how this will work within your own household dynamics.

, This includes both personal and career goals. What career path are you interested in taking? Are you looking for the college experience, a flexible schedule, more time at home with your family, or new social opportunities? If you're looking to meet new people or to live the college experience, you may not want to choose an online degree. On the other hand, if you're after spending more time with your family or having a flexible schedule, you may find that an online degree is a good choice.

"
"
Research online degree programs.,
Determine if any of the available degree programs could help you meet your goals.",How to Know if an Online Degree Is Right for You3," Visit some college websites to determine if the degree you are interested in may be obtained online.


If the program or parts of the program you want is not available online, you will need to enrolling in traditional face-to-face classes. In some cases, you may be able to do some of the work online but have a component where attendance is essential. Consider whether this can be worked into your budget and time availability.

,


Do any of the programs sound as if they could help you achieve your goals? If your dream is to become a botanist, for example, and there are no online degree programs related to the field of botany, you may want to skip the online degree and obtain yours in the traditional manner. However, if you have always wanted to work in the law and find several paralegal degree programs available in your area, online school may be the right choice for you.
Are most elements of the degree suitable but one or two key areas are missing? Investigate whether you'll get the qualifications you're after by pursuing the degree and taking a few extra shorter or tailored courses to fill in the gaps.

"
"
Think about the resources you have available.",How to Know if an Online Degree Is Right for You4," Getting a degree online means you need to have regular access to a computer and high-speed internet service, as well as a comfortable and quiet place to work. Computers are reasonably cheap but renting one can be even cheaper and enables you to access the latest products and software without having to shell out the total cost. As for internet access, if you can't afford high speed internet at home, some options for places to work on your classes include:


The public library. Many public libraries provide computers with high-speed internet access for patrons. Check with your library for restrictions on use of the computers; it's no good if you're only permitted half hour slots here and there!
Your college’s computer lab. If you're pursuing your online degree from a local college or university, its computer lab should be available for your use during lab hours. Check with your school for more information.
A restaurant or café that offers wifi. Many restaurants, cafés, and coffee shops offer customers free wireless internet services.

Find an online job.,
Work as a tutor.,
Consider personal fundraising.",How to Make Money During a Semester Abroad2," While you are abroad it may be a good idea to find some income by doing work online. There are many jobs these days that you can do from anywhere, as long as you have an internet connection. With an online job you can both make money while abroad and you can usually create your own schedule, which works well with a student's schedule.Some jobs that can be done online exclusively include writing, graphic design, virtual assistant, and creating your own online business.
In order to find an online job you should do an online search for jobs in your desired field. Try going to websites that are specifically designed to list part-time and flexible jobs., If you are planning on studying abroad you may be able to work at the school you are going to. This could include working for the actual school as a tutor or working under the table as a tutor for other students who need some assistance.In many cases, there will be people in the community that you are moving into that may be interested in getting English tutoring or lessons.

, When studying abroad, you may need to rely on others to help you financially. This could be in the form of fundraising from family and friends, or going to organizations or individuals in your community that would want to invest in your particular study program or schooling outcome. One way to let others know that you need their financial help and what you will use any funds they give you for is to create an online fundraising campaign. With an online fundraising campaign you can make a video that will outline why you are studying abroad and why you think others should support you financially.
If you are doing a study abroad program with a clear educational or job goal at the end of it, you may be able to find an organization or individual that is willing to invest in your future. For example, your local chamber of commerce or city hall may be willing to invest in your future if you have been an active part of your community.

"
"
Make a budget.,
Take location into consideration.,
Reduce your costs.",How to Make Money During a Semester Abroad3," Before you go on a semester abroad you should make a budget for the amount of money you have and how long you will be gone. Making a budget requires that you have a general understanding of costs in the country you are going to and that you know what will, and won't, be covered by the tuition costs you pay upfront.


When making a budget it is a good idea to leave a little bit of wiggle room by allocating emergency funds, if you can. If you budget down to the last penny, you may end up with unexpected costs that you can't cover.

, In many cases, you will be able to live on less than you do at home. This is especially true if you are doing a study abroad program in a smaller city or a country with a low cost of living. If you are coming from a country that has a high standard of living and the money has a high value, then you may be able to live on less when you are abroad.However, the opposite can be true as well. If you are used to a low cost of living and you are going to a place with a high cost of living, such as London, then you will need to take that into consideration. Your money will not go as far as it would at home.
One thing to do while preparing for your trip is to look at the exchange rate for currency between your home and where you are visiting. If your currency is strong compared to the currency you are exchanging for, then it will help you financially while you travel because your money will go further., Making changes to your individual habits, preferences, and travel choices while you are abroad can dramatically decrease the cost of living abroad. Consider abandoning your normal luxuries while you are abroad and instead try to live frugally.


For example, this could include avoiding buying new clothes or accessories, eating homemade food more often, or traveling via the cheapest methods.
If you cut down on your costs, then you can cut down on your need to make money while abroad.

Decide on the project location.,
Keep in mind that sampling areas must:

Be random
Be widely spread apart
Represent the entire project location
Be the exact same size
Have a known area.

,If applicable, choose sample areas that are both in reserves and nearby (within >8km) non-reserve areas.,
Select your sample method.",How to Measure Biodiversity for a College Field Project1,"

What creatures fascinate you the most (for example, crabs)?
As you’re doing a project likely inspired by conservation, what ecosystems (which contain those fascinating creatures) are in dire need of conservation (for example, tropical oceans)?
Then, research to find which organisms are classified as threatened or endangered to specify a project location (for example, a nearby state park). Greater diversity stems from a large sample size. Thus: more area → more specimens, more specimens → more species get recorded;
,,, A type of sample method is a quadrant, which is a plot of land marked off for the study of plants or animals. Although the term implies a four-sided area, this is not necessary – many shapes are satisfactory. Continuing with the above example, you may instead use baited crab pots randomly placed at specific depths and distances apart throughout applicable areas in the Evergreen Beach.

Seek to achieve randomness in your sampling. For example:

Get a map of the project location
Draw a precise grid with many squares on the map
Label each square on the map with a number
Use a random number generator to choose squares.


To ensure great distance between samples, make each square very far apart and then designate a smaller sample area within the original square chosen by the generator.

Consider whether or not a second bachelor’s degree is the right plan for you.For many careers and goals, having just a single bachelor’s degree is sufficient.,
Choose the right field of study based on your career plans and an institution’s admissions requirements.,
Determine how you would fund a second bachelor’s degree program.",How to Get a Second Bachelor's Degree1," Those interested in more advanced study in a particular field might consider entering a graduate school program instead of earning a second bachelor’s degree, since graduate degrees can open additional career possibilities and provide more substantial qualifications if you want to work in a particular field.


Second bachelor’s degrees make the most sense if a career change or other factor requires you to acquire a body of knowledge in a substantially different field.Some potential employers or others who review your credentials might see earning a second bachelor’s degree as showing a lack of commitment, so be prepared to explain your reason for earning one if you decide it is the best plan for you.
Many graduate programs don't necessarily require an undergraduate degree in the same field as a prerequisite for admission. For instance, you may be able to enter a graduate program in Sociology even if your undergraduate degree is in Anthropology, or a program in English if your bachelor's degree is in Computer Science. With this in mind, consider whether a graduate program or a second bachelor's degree is the best option for your plans. You can contact the graduate coordinator of the program you're interested in for details.;
, Many programs will only consider admitting second bachelor’s degree students if their intended field of study is substantially different from their first bachelor’s degree.For instance, if you already have a bachelor’s degree in biology, some institutions will not admit you if you want to earn a second bachelor’s degree in microbiology. However, the same institution might consider admitting you if you want to earn a second bachelor’s degree in computer science.


Generally, the intention of most colleges and universities is to award first bachelor’s degrees to students., While you may be able to find some financial aid as a second bachelor’s degree student, many loans, grants, and scholarships are only available to first bachelor’s degree students. When selecting a school and program, or deciding to get a second bachelor’s degree at all, make sure to consider the cost of attendance (tuition, fees, living expenses, etc.).


You can find information about costs of attendance at a particular college or university via its admissions website.
Private loans may be available to fund a second bachelor’s degree program, but can have high interest rates.
Contact an institution’s financial aid office about particular sources of funding that might be available to you as a second bachelor’s degree student.

Set up an appointment to speak with your professor.,
Be ready to submit a written rebuttal.,
Be respectful and professional at all times.,
Ask the professor to clarify comments.,
Emphasize your desire to improve.",How to Get a Professor to Change Your Grade1," In many countries there are laws that forbid professors from discussing grades via email. Instead of attempting to have a conversation about your grade over email, set up an appointment to talk to your professor face-to-face.Try talking to your professor after class. You can say, “Dr. Johnson, I am concerned about the grade I earned on the exam. Can we set up a time to meet?”;
, If you decide to proceed with challenging your grade, most professors will make you submit your objections in writing. You will need to outline why your assignment deserves a higher grade, and how the evidence you submitted in the assignment fulfilled the professor’s guidelines. It is also helpful to incorporate the professor’s comments on your assignment into the written rebuttal., You should always act with courtesy toward your professors, even if you disagree with them. Being aggressive or confrontational is not acceptable, and can land you in a heap of trouble. Always speak to your professor with respect, act like a professional, and never, ever threaten a professor., In many cases, you can clear up a misunderstanding over your grade by asking the professor to explain their comments in more detail. This gives the professor a chance to talk at length about their comments, and will help you understand why you earned the grade.Try saying, “Dr. Smith, I’m confused by what you meant in your comment about my lack of organization. Can you explain this to me?

, It’s important that your professor understands you want to improve your performance in the course. During your meeting ask the professor to give you suggestions on how to improve on future assignments. Try saying, “I’m really committed to improving my grade in this course. How can I do better on the next assignment?”You can say, “Dr. Anderson, I am dedicated to improving my grade in this course. What are some specific actions I can take to improve my grade?”

Educate yourself on local Possession and Collection laws before collecting.,Collect specimens at consistent and precise time intervals.,
Use worldwide definitions of an individual’s category, or recognizable taxonomic unit, RTU.,
Factor in what time of year and day to collect specimens.,
Define the size of adults and juveniles.,
Consider devising a mechanism to draw them in.,
Depending on your collection permit, you may be able to collect the entire sample area.",How to Measure Biodiversity for a College Field Project2," In many jurisdictions, collecting or keeping wildlife is restricted or even forbidden. Check laws online or ask a local authority or bureau responsible for wildlife for details.,, (for example, subspecies, species, etc).

If you cannot identify a species, morphospecies, give it a descriptive name and use that name consistently.

,

Mating, spawning, and flowering seasons are the best times to collect.

, Does age matter? Are you only collecting adults? Or will juveniles be included?

How big or small are your specimens? Are they the size of a grain of sand? Or are they as large as a tree?
If they’re small, devise ways to extract them. For example, use very fine filters to rinse away debris, or use Salt and Hollick’s benzene flotation method where insects accumulate at the benzene-water interface and plant matter stays in the water, etc.
If they’re large, collect clippings of a sort; for example, hair, toenails, leaves, etc.

, If your specimens are animals, what do they like to eat or to be near?, In which case, identify each specimen alphabetically, numerically or alphanumerically."
"
Collect as much as possible.,
Whether independent or in a group, all data must be:

Precise and accurate
Consistent throughout
Clear and straightforward.

",How to Measure Biodiversity for a College Field Project3," You can never have too much data. Collecting everything from date and time to weather and size of specimen to the mm is fantastic. Everything could be extremely useful if, or when, you decide to collect data again.,"
"
Apply measurements.",How to Measure Biodiversity for a College Field Project4," The most common measures of biodiversity are species richness, Simpson’s index, and Shannon’s index. Although it’s good to know what each test helps you understand, software programs have been designed to do the math for you. The most commonly used program for measuring biodiversity is EstimateS. The count of the species coupled with these tests, summarizes most of the information on biodiversity.


Species richness: This is the simplest measure of species diversity. Simply count the number of species found in your sample area.

Simpson’s index: The probability of picking two different organisms at random.

Aids in understanding the biodiversity across communities.
Gives more attention to common species rather than rare species.
Works very well with small samples.



Shannon’s index: Should only be used on random samples taken from a large community where the total number of species is known.

Measures the order, or disorder, observed within a specific community.
Can be used to determine evenness, a measure of abundance similarity among the various species in the community.

Choose an institution or program you are permitted to enroll in.,
Meet admissions requirements.,
Complete the application for admission.",How to Get a Second Bachelor's Degree2," Some institutions or particular programs limit the number of second bachelor’s degree students they admit, or will not accept them at all.This is more frequently the case for high-demand courses of study or at campuses where student enrollment is at or above capacity.If this is the case for you, either look for a different institution to study the same subject at, or choose a different program of study at the same institution.


You can search for colleges and universities in a particular area using online databases.Then, check the admissions website for an institution you are interested in to see if it admits students seeking a second bachelor's degree.

, Each college or university will consider specific criteria when determining which applicants to admit. Matching these criteria does not guarantee admission, but increases your chances of being accepted. For applicants seeking a second bachelor’s degree, common admissions requirements include:Completion of a four-year college course of study leading to a bachelor’s degree. Most colleges and universities require your first bachelor’s degree to have been awarded by a regionally accredited institution.
Previous good standing at the last college or university you attended.
A good GPA. Many institutions require second bachelor’s degree applicants to have maintained a GPA above a certain threshold, particularly if the intended concentration is in a high-demand field.
If you are an international student, there may be additional admissions requirements for you, such as certifying language competency or showing proof of accreditation for your previous bachelor’s degree., Depending on the college or university you are applying to, there may be a special application for second bachelor’s degree students. Other colleges and universities will have only one application for all students.Check the admissions website for a college or university you are thinking about applying to for details on the application process.


Most institutions have application fees, including for those seeking a second bachelor’s degree.You may have to submit special documents as part of your application, including transcripts and/or proof of your previous degree, a statement of purpose or admissions essay, etc.
If you are seeking a second bachelor’s degree at the same institution which awarded your first one, you may be asked to complete an application for readmission instead."

Ask for extra credit.,
Inquire about re-doing the assignment.,
Reconsider taking it to a higher level.,
Let it go.",How to Get a Professor to Change Your Grade2," Sometimes you can raise your grade in a class by doing extra credit. You can try asking your professor for an additional paper or assignment to earn extra points. Keep in mind that many professors, however, do not offer extra credit.Consider asking, “Dr. Toothman, do you offer extra credit? Perhaps I could write another paper to earn some extra points.

, This can be a feasible solution if your professor is open to the idea. Ask the professor if you can take a second shot at the assignment. For example, you can ask to write a new paper on the same or a similar topic., You should think carefully before appealing your grade at a higher level. Unless the professor made a clear mistake, those above them will support the original grade. If you truly believe you can make a strong case for a grade change, make sure you follow the appropriate chain of command. Ask your university’s office of student affairs about the proper procedure., Unless the professor made an obvious mistake while calculating your grade, it is in your best interest to let it go. Pursuing an unwarranted grade change will not put you in a favorable light with the professor. More importantly, the effort you spend pursuing a grade change can be better spent on studying."
"
Understand the grading process.,
Decide if it’s worth your time and energy.,
Review the course syllabus.,
Make sure you followed the assignment instructions.,
Carefully read the professor’s comments.",How to Get a Professor to Change Your Grade3," Unless the professor made a glaring error while grading your assignment or determining your course grade, they are unlikely to change your grade. It is also important to remember that grades are earned, not given. You do not earn a grade based on how hard you work, but rather how well you have mastered the material., In most cases, it is not worth your time or energy to attempt to get a professor to change your grade. The process will suck up valuable time, which can be better spent on future assignments and your other coursework. Before approaching your professor, think about whether it is worth the hassle.

, It’s important that you go over the course syllabus in detail before approaching your professor about the grade you earned. Carefully read every word of the syllabus, paying specific attention to the sections on assignments and how your grade is calculated.For example, if you turned in the assignment late, you should consult the syllabus about the professor’s late assignment policy. This might explain why you earned a particular grade.

, Before you approach a professor about changing your grade, you need to make sure you followed instructions for the assignment in question. Look over the assignment instructions and carefully consider each part of them. Not following instructions is often the reason you did not earn the grade you expected.For example, if the assignment instructions say to turn in a 5-page paper and you only turned in 2 pages, it might explain your grade.

, Before you freak out over a grade, you should carefully read all of the comments that the professor included on the assignment. In most cases, these comments will tell you why you earned a particular grade.If you have trouble reading or understanding your professor’s comments, try asking them to clarify.

Look up websites that rank master’s degrees by earning potential.,
Choose a job with high growth potential.,
Look for high job satisfaction.,

Weigh the investment versus the likelihood of a higher salary.",How to Find the Most Profitable Master's Degrees," There are many resources on the web for finding high paying master’s degrees. Three good sources are Payscale.com, Forbes.com, and U.S. News and World Report. The collective wisdom of these sites gives a standard list of the top five high-paying master’s degrees.Nurse Anesthetist comes in first with an average starting salary of $140,000 and a mid-career average salary of $156,000.Computer Science is second, with an average starting salary of $95,900 and a mid-career average salary of $134,000.Operations Research is third, with an average starting salary of $80,800 and a mid-career average salary of $130,000.Electrical & Electronics Engineer is fourth, with an average starting salary of $79,500 and a mid-career average salary of $129,000.
Taxation is fifth, with an average starting salary of $61,000 and a mid-career average salary of $129,000.
Remember that these numbers, and the numbers you find on other websites, are just averages. If you plan to live in San Francisco, your starting salary will likely be higher than someone who lives in Omaha.;
, A job that is growing quickly in popularity is likely to be more stable and high-paying than a job that has little growth or competition. Head to the Bureau of Labor Statistics website to search for jobs by projected growth rate.Jobs in the “10 to 19 percent” projected growth rate category are likely to pay higher salaries.Nurse Anesthetist comes in first once again, with a projected growth rate of 31%.

, Even if your goal is to make as much money as you can with your master’s degree, it makes sense to consider job satisfaction. There might be two jobs that pay the same high average salary but people in one job report much higher job satisfaction than those in the other job. Head back to Payscale.com to search for jobs based on job satisfaction.Once again, you’ll find that healthcare workers—like Nurse Anesthetists—top out the list.

, Some master’s degree programs require specific educational requirements. For example, to get a master’s degree in nurse anesthesia, you’ll need to have either a Bachelor in Nursing or be a Registered Nurse, or both. To get a master’s degree in computer science most schools require a bachelor’s degree in computer science or mathematics.If you don’t have the prerequisite educational background, don’t despair. Some schools will allow you to take a remedial series of courses to get caught up on the information you’ll need to perform well in a master’s program. Contact schools’ admissions departments to find out if a remedial program is available.
If you’re still in a bachelor’s program, you might be able to squeeze in a few specialized classes to meet a master’s degree program admission requirements.
For most master’s degree programs you’ll need to take an educational aptitude test like the GRE or the GMAT. You can find out what tests are required by visiting schools’ admissions department websites or calling the school.

, Even if your bachelor’s degree is in computer science, you might find after four years of school that a career in computer science doesn’t appeal to you. Don’t feel stuck continuing down the educational path you’ve pursued so far. Remember that there are high-paying master’s degrees in a variety of fields.If you’re unsure what field you’re interested in, talk to friends and family about your interests. Try to network with people in the top five high-paying master’s degree fields. You might ask them what their average day looks like. This will help you determine if the field suits your interests.
If money is absolutely the most important thing to you, it may be that it doesn’t matter if you’re interested in a particular career—as long as it pays well.

, Even if you have the right educational background and you’re interested in a field, you might not be very good at it. For example, maybe you majored in computer science and liked it but you always got C grades. Consider if your lack of aptitude for computer science will hold you back. Someone who struggles to be competent in a field will likely end up making less money than the average employee.If your skills are simply rusty—for example, if you’ve been working in a field other than the one your want to get a master’s degree in—consider auditing a few classes at a community college to bone up on your skills. Alternatively, there are lots of internet-based resources, such as Harvard, that offer free courses online., The average cost of a master’s degree at a public university is $30,000. At a private school, the average cost is $40,000. One school of wisdom say you shouldn’t take on more school debt than you’ll make in your salary in the first year. Thankfully, with the top high-paying master’s degrees, your salary is likely to be above six figures from the start.Some schools charge far more tuition than others. For example, a nurse anesthetist master’s degree from the University of Pittsburg will run you $119,290. Still within the recommended range since the average starting salary for a Nurse Anesthetist is $140,000; however, you can get the same degree for $23,734 at the University of Akron.Remember that tuition is likely to be significantly lower if you’re a resident of the state. For example, in-state tuition for nurse anesthesia degree at California State University Fullerton is $35,320, while out-of-state tuition is $61,642.
Don’t forget about grants and scholarships. These may significantly lower your tuition bill. Check with a school’s admissions department to ask what options are available.

, If you pursue a full-time master’s degree you won’t be able to work full-time for at least a year—more likely two. Consider how much money you would make during those two years when deciding to apply to master’s programs.For example, if you could make $200,000 in two years and the total predicted return on your master’s degree, over you entire career, is $180,000, you would make more money overall by working instead of getting a master’s degree.

, If you’re already working at an established job and you want to stay at that job, find out how much more money people with master’s degrees make. If it’s only a few thousand dollars, it may not be worth it to get a master’s degree. For example, by mid-career, petroleum engineers with bachelor’s degrees make nearly the same amount of money as petroleum engineers with master’s degrees."

Cooking knives and serving spoons
Other cooking utensils (scissors, grater, peeler, etc.),
Don’t pack valuable or frivolous things.,
Pack everything water-tight.,
Remember, you can simply leave things you don’t need in the cars when you reach the river – so at home, pack everything you think you might need.

,

Learn how to deal with capsizes (only for flat water – not to be done in a rapid).,
If using canoes: Make sure the weight is evenly distributed around the canoe.,

Gaze at the starry night sky.",How to Have a Great River Adventure," It is wise to use a part of a not-dangerous river that is regularly used by other river adventurers. The distance. On a ‘medium-sized’ river (that a proficient swimmer could swim across safely and easily), a group of average-fitness people can paddle up to about 20 kilometers (12 mi) in a day comfortably.;
, You’ll need enough vehicles to get everyone to the river, with their baggage and all the gear, with the trailer/s carrying all the river craft (the canoes or rafts).

, This person will need a large enough vehicle to transport all the people (or you can do several trips back and forth), all the gear, and all the river craft. Find out from locals where the good places are to reach the river by car.

, Physical ability (able to paddle and do adventurous activities) is only half of the requirement: everyone needs to be mentally happy and ready to have the adventure. Some people will be out of their comfort zone, and need to be ready for it.

, The best river companies take care of almost everything in this article, from when you arrive at the river to when you leave to go home. The professional standard for the size of the guide team is no more than 7 clients per guide (so 3 guides for 20 friends).

, These include a doctor or medic; someone who knows the area well; someone who swims very well; someone who can cook well. Each of these people needs to be able to call on other members of the group to help with their activities (especially cooking and water safety).

, Canoes or rafts. Typical canoes will take 2 people and their gear, while rafts will take two or more. Make sure they are in good condition. Make sure you have the right repair equipment too: rubber repair kits and pumps for rafts, and fibreglass repair kits for canoes.

, You’ll need warm comfy clothing for land, and water-ready and sun-ready clothing for the paddling. Clothing depends largely on the season and climate of the area, so you will benefit from contacting and asking a local.

, This isn’t just about having a tent! In fact, having a tent is optional, depending on the river you’re going to be on. Ensure that you’ve considered packing:


Sleeping bedding (inflatable or roll-up mattresses, sleeping bags, etc.)
A tent; these are only necessary in harsh environments
A torch and / or a lamp, with spare batteries for each
A fold-up table and fold-up chairs will be really appreciated
Umbrellas or tarpaulins for shade and shelter
A spade and mini-saw or axe may be useful
Other useful tools (lighter, utility knife, ropes, duct tape, etc.)
A well-stocked first-aid kit is essential!

,


Canoes or river rafts
Helmets
Personal flotation device (PFD or life jacket)
Water-tight buckets or dry-bags
Elastic or soft ropes to tie everything down

, This really depends on your group. Keep in mind that the adventure will make you hungrier than at home, so pack 1.5 times more than you think you’d usually eat. Also take into account how you’ll be preparing and cooking the food. Cooking over a fire is a really great experience, but may take longer, and is less predictable than other methods like gas cooking. Try to plan healthy, balanced meals that include protein, carbohydrates and fruit & vegetables.

, No matter the river conditions, the activity will make you sweat and lose bodily fluid. Pack enough water (3 litres of water per person per day is a safe guess) plus some other drinks for the camp at night.

,
A set of cutlery and crockery for each person in the group
Garbage bags (which you must dispose of properly after the adventure)

, There will be no need for mirrors or makeup. You probably won’t need watches, wallets, purses, or mobile phones (keep one mobile phone just in case, but keep it off until you need it). Don’t pack glass where possible – if it breaks, it is dangerous and becomes pollution.

, The most commonly-used and practical packing containers are 25l / 30l water-tight buckets (which can be bought from plastics shops), or thick dry-bags, which have one opening that rolls up and is clipped to seal it. Anything that may get wet can go directly onto / into the watercraft – but make ensure they’re tied down tightly so they don’t get lost during a capsize in a rapid.

,, Ask the most experienced paddler in the group to demonstrate good paddling technique. Make sure you can paddle forward and backward (or stop), turn left and right gently, and turn sharply when needed. The more vigilant person should be in the front (to spot rocks and other obstacles), and the person at the back should be the stronger person (this person will do most of the steering). Also plan carefully how your group will stay together down the river; have someone experienced at the front and at the back of the group.

, For canoes: grab the nose of the canoe and swim with it to the shore. Empty the water by removing all baggage and gear, placing one end high up (on a rock), and turning it over. For rafts, you can flip the raft back over while in the water by climbing on top of it, grabbing the rope/line on the far side of the raft and leaning back.

, Don’t pack your baggage on either the left or right side of the canoe, as this will make paddling and steering more difficult. Also, if you’re paddling in wind, make sure you have enough weight in the nose of the canoe so that it can’t be spun around by the wind.

, Don’t dive into not-clear water if you can’t see the bottom – rocks just below the surface can be invisible. Don’t go down a rapid if you’re not with the entire group. Don’t drink any alcohol if you’re in the sun – you’ll get dehydrated extra fast. #Don’t take drugs before or while paddling, as these will make swimming (or just falling in the water) very unsafe.

, Protect yourself from the sun with sun cream, a hat (wide-brimmed if possible), and by drinking lots of water. Wear your PFD (and helmet if you have one) whenever you’re near a rapid.

, Always scout a rapid before going down it; park the boats on the bank just above the rapid and take a careful look at the entire rapid. For most rapids, you should go down single-file (one boat at a time, with a few boat-lengths of space in between). Deal with oncoming obstacles like rocks as quickly and decisively as possible – this requires good communication between partners and among the group. For canoes: lean towards the rocks to bounce off them and not capsize. If you capsize in a rapid, stay far from the river craft as possible (it is dangerous because it can pin you against rocks). No person should act heroically; rather act carefully and wisely – you can always pick up floating baggage further down the river.

, The first thing you need to decide on is where to place the fire. It needs to be relatively sheltered (from wind and other elements), and convenient to reach from where you put the tables to make food. Build a circular fireplace from rocks and stones – this is important to keep the fire contained, and to place cooking grids on. Keep all the cooking equipment near (behind) the food-making tables. A refreshment station with tea / coffee, other drinks and snacks is always appreciated. Make sure you have clean water to wash food and cooking equipment with, and keep a bin nearby as well. Only make a bonfire at night if you’ve brought wood to do so with – don’t use wood from the area.

, Keep this a short walk from the rest of the camp, behind some trees or bushes if possible. The toiletry setup depends on the equipment you have. Some people want a toilet seat (with a hole), which others are content to dig their own hole each time. Make sure that you put used toilet paper in a bin or burn it; burying it does not get rid of it. For those who want to get clean in the evening, only use nature-friendly products, whether you have a camping shower or use the river.

, With the free time and open areas you find, there are as many games to play as you can imagine. There are many games you can play with no required tools (like charades). Bring along a deck or two of cards to play with. Bring ball games if possible. There are also many games you can plan with river craft and paddles. Bring along as many musical instruments as possible and get everyone involved in making music – especially around the fire after dinner.

, Play around in the water – if it’s warm enough. Appreciate how quiet it is so far from the rest of civilization. Let your mind wander and drift; relax and take it all in.

, Consider the unusual geographic formations that caused the river to be right there, and how it twists and turns. Also try to find out about the natural- and human-history of that part of the river. Find out how different it was 10, 100, or 1000 years ago, and consider how it should be kept that way.

, There may be many species of wild animals and unusual plants along the river; to know as many as you can. If possible, find a list of the common animal and plant species in the area and check them off as you spot them. Make sure you keep a safe distance from wild animals though.

, Depending on the hemisphere you’re in (Northern or Southern), and the time of the year, there will be many distinct star formations to see. Take along a map of the sky if possible. Remember that if the river is far from a town or city, the sky will be far more clear and impressive than what you’re used to back home.

Watch for side effects.",How to Get Immunizations for Traveling," To start, you'll want to check your existing vaccination records to see if you're due for any routine immunizations. You can ask your parents or your doctor for a copy of your records. You may also be able to find a copy online through the Center for Disease Control and Prevention website.Routine vaccinations are the vaccinations you would have received as a child in the form of a booster shot. Things like whooping cough and meningitis are usually vaccinated against in childhood. Vaccinations only last so long, and you may need a follow up vaccination if you have not received a shot since childhood.
Your doctor may have your vaccination records on hand. You may also be able to get vaccination records from your parents, as you likely got vaccinated as a child.
If you cannot find a record of your vaccinations, the CDC has a quiz you can take online. Using factors like your date of birth and gender, they can determine which vaccinations you likely need.;
, You may be up-to-date on routine vaccinations, especially if you're on the younger side. However, if you need something like a tetanus shot, make an appointment with your doctor. You want to make sure you get vaccinated before leaving for your trip. For international travel especially, being up-to-date on vaccinations may be required.Stores like Walgreens sometimes have walk-in clinics where you may be able to get a vaccination if your doctor is not free.

, Vaccinations for shingles are often administered as routine vaccinations. However, they are not as common as other vaccinations typically given in childhood. If you're traveling abroad, ask your doctor about the shingles vaccination. It may be worth your time to get vaccinated for these diseases depending on where you're traveling.Shingles is a virus similar to chicken pox that causes a painful rash. It is not life threatening, but can be very painful.Coming down with shingles could potentially derail your trip, so ask your doctor if there's an increased risk for shingles where you're traveling.
If a shingles vaccine is reccomended, schedule one with your healthcare provider alongside any other routine vaccinations that are required for your travels.

, Vaccines are typically an easy procedure and do not require a lot of aftercare. However, you may have to practice some routine aftercare in regards to removing any bandages and watching for side effects. Ask your doctor about aftercare after receiving vaccinations.


Keep in mind some vaccinations require several rounds of shots. Make sure you understand how many shots you need to be safely vaccinated for a variety of diseases.

, Some destinations may require specific vaccinations. Vaccines against unusual diseases in the United States, like rabies and country-specific illnesses, may be required depending on where you're traveling.To see what special vaccinations are required, you can call an embassy or consulate of the country you're visiting to ask.You can also find the information on websites for organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
You may want to ask your doctor as well, although your doctor may not know if he or she does not specialize in international medicine.

, In some countries, the disease yellow fever is prevalent. You are required to get a yellow fever vaccination before traveling to certain countries. You can find out if you need a yellow fever vaccination the same way you find out if you need other specific vaccinations. Consult an embassy or consulate or go online and get the information from the CDC or the WHO., Your regular doctor's office may not offer all the immunizations you need before traveling. You'll need to find a travel clinic, where you'll be provided with vaccinations for unusual diseases. If you cannot find a travel clinic in your area, you may have to take a day off to travel to a nearby clinic for the necessary vaccines.It's especially important to find a travel clinic if you're traveling to Africa, Mexico, Central America, South America, or Southeast Asia. In these countries, there is a higher risk of contracting malaria and other serious illnesses.

, Immunizations may take awhile to take effect. You also may need several rounds of shots for some immunizations. Make sure to book your appointment well in advance so you're vaccinated in time for your trip.You should obtain the necessary vaccinations at least 4 to 6 weeks before you leave for your trip.
If you need to go to a special travel clinic, make sure you incorporate that into your schedule. If you have to make a day trip to get to a clinic near you, make sure to set aside time to make the trip 4 to 6 weeks before you leave.

, You may have to present your immunization record at customs, especially if you're traveling to an area that requires special vaccines. Make sure you ask your doctor for a Certificate of Vaccination. Make sure to pack it in your carry-on luggage so you'll have it on-hand when asked., Vaccinations are generally safe. However, certain medical conditions mean you may want to hold off on being vaccinated. Talk to your doctor about getting vaccinated if you have any of the following health conditions:If you have a severe allergy to any type of vaccination
If you're pregnant or breastfeeding
If you have a disease, such as diabetes or HIV, that weakens your immune system

, Vaccinations are generally safe. However, they may come with side effects like a slight rash, pain, or swelling at the injection site. You also may experience a headache, fatigue, or joint pain. Most side effects pass within a couple of days, and can be treated with over-the-counter painkillers.In very rare cases, you may have an immediate allergic reaction a vaccine. If this is the case, you will be immediately treated by a healthcare professional. For the most part, allergic reactions are rare and reversible.

Land the balloon.",How to Fly a Hot Air Balloon," Hot air balloons are based on a simple concept. As you heat air, or any other gas, it becomes less dense. Just like a bubble rising in an aquarium, the hot air will float above the denser, colder air around it.Get the air in the balloon hot enough, and it can lift the balloon canvas, the basket, and everyone inside it as well.


Air gets progressively thinner (less dense) as you travel upward, because there is less pressure from the weight of the air above it.Because of this, a hot air balloon only rises until it reaches the point where the density of the balloon plus the air inside it is equal to the density of the air around it.;
, The structure is so simple that you may already understand it, but learn the terminology so you and your crew can communicate to each other:


The fabric balloon itself is called an envelope, made from sewn panels called gores.
In most balloons, there's a hole at the top of the envelope, tightly covered by a flap of fabric. This is called a parachute valve.It is attached to a rip line that runs all the way down to the basket.
The bottom end of the envelope, or mouth, is located above a burner, which produces flame fueled by the propane tanks underneath.
The propane tanks, passengers, and cargo all stand in a basket attached beneath the envelope.

, The pilot should wear safety goggles, since they will be close to the flame. Pilot and crew should wear heavy-duty gloves, long sleeves, and long pants, and avoid nylon, polyester, or other materials that melt when exposed to flame.


Everyone in the basket should keep in mind that the balloon may land in mud or rough terrain, and wear comfortable clothes and shoes.

, All it takes to add propane to the fire is opening a simple blast valve on the line attached to the propane tanks, typically located just beneath the burner.The wider you hold the valve open, the more heat rushes into the balloon, and the faster it rises.


Dropping ballast, or any heavy object, over the side of the balloon will reduce the overall density of the balloon, and cause you to rise. For obvious reasons, this method is not recommended above populated areas.

, Like any object hotter than the surrounding environment, the hot air balloon cools down over time, which causes it to sink gradually. In order to stay at the same height, you'll need to use one or both of these techniques:


The propane tank themselves have a metering valve or ""cruise"" that controls how much propane feeds the burner. Gradually opening this as you fly is an easy way to stay at roughly the same altitude.
A short burst of additional propane from the blast valve will lift the balloon up when you notice it dipping too low.

, Remember, the parachute valve is the flap of fabric on the top of the balloon envelope. This flap automatically seals itself when left alone, but you can pull a red cord called a rip line to lift the flap. This lets hot air escape from the top. Keep the cord pulled until the balloon is lowering at the desired rate, then let go to close the flap again.


The parachute valve is also called a deflation port, and the rip line a deflation port line.

, Balloons have no direct way to control the direction they travel. However, there are typically several layers of wind stacked on top of each other, blowing in different directions. Raise or lower the balloon to catch a different cross-stream, and your balloon will change direction. Pilots often need to improvise the route as they go along, to some extent, and it takes experience and planning to catch the right wind at the right time.Many balloons have cords that pull open side vents or flaps on the side of the envelope, but these just rotate the basket.Almost all hot air balloon flights are shadowed by a car or truck on the ground, picking up the balloon and its passengers once it lands.

, The instructions below can help you understand the duties and skills required of a balloon pilot, but they cannot substitute for real experience. A full balloon pilot's license and training can cost thousands of dollars, but you can start by volunteering to be part of a ground crew.Once you have on-the-ground training, you'll only need about 10 to 15 hours of total flight training to pass the certification test, although this varies by country., Knowing when to cancel a flight is extremely important. Flying in strong winds is dangerous and should not be attempted. Beginners should stick to the first few hours after sunrise and the first few hours before sunset, when wind is usually predictable and low-speed., At the least, the basket should contain a fire extinguisher, a first aid kit, a topographic map, an aviation map, an altimeter, and a log book to record the details of your flight. Check the propane tank's fuel gauge so you can be sure there's enough fuel for the flight — typically about 30 gallons (114 liters) per hour.For longer flights, you'll also need radio equipment, and possibly electronic navigation equipment as well.

, Almost all balloons require several people to get off the ground. First, the burner is attached to the basket frame, and laid down sideways with the envelope attached and unfolded along the ground. The envelope mouth is lifted open and inflated using a powerful fan for about ten minutes, then heated using the burner. The basket is typically held down by crew members, and/or tied to the ground car until the balloon is ready for lift-off. The basket is righted, the passengers and pilot get in, and the pilot releases a steady flame from the burner to lift off the ground., As the pilot, you should stay alert and watch the inflating envelope and the ground crew's hold on the lines until everything is steady and proceeding as planned. Briefly but methodically check in all directions for all trees or other obstacles the balloon might hit on its way up. Once you feel the first breeze as lift-off begins, immediately fix your eyes at the obstacle closest to your flight path, and do not look away until the balloon is safely above it.This makes it easier to notice a deviation in direction, and to react to it by rising faster.

, Prospective balloon pilots must pass a meteorology test to gain certification, including a basic understanding of how temperature, altitude, and humidity interact, and what different types of clouds can tell you about air conditions. While these aren't all covered in this guide, here are a couple examples of common phenomena:


A significant change in wind direction as you rise or fall is called wind shear, and requires special focus as it can speed up or slow down your motion. If strong wind shear blows out your burner's pilot light, relight it and heat the balloon as soon as possible to avoid crashing.
If the balloon is responding more slowly to your actions, or you notice air pollution trapped instead of rising, you may be in an ""inversion,"" where the surrounding air is hotter the higher you go. Compensate by increasing the amount of heat added or let off when you want to change altitude.

, Learn how to read a weather map, and use them to plan around the general wind speed and direction in different areas. To test for local wind conditions below you, spit or squirt shaving cream over the edge of the basket.

, Balloon pilots are trained to use a topographic map and altimeter to plot their course and altitude throughout the flight. Obtain an aviation map from your regional aviation administration, and use it to stay out of the path of aircraft. A GPS unit, magnetic compass, and pair of binoculars are also useful, but not always necessary for short flights, unless required by law in your area.

, If you experience any turbulence, or if charts, clouds, or other weather phenomena lead you to expect it, land as soon as you can. Similarly, if you feel any circular motion or unexpected ascent, land immediately before the rising ""thermal"" of warm air sends the balloon out of control. Vent air rapidly once you land out of a thermal, or it could tug the basket along the ground.

, Practice relighting the pilot light so you can do so rapidly in mid-flight during an emergency. If the pilot light does not relight, there may be a fuel clog. This requires relighting the propane above the blast valve, which should be taught under experienced supervision. In the worst case scenario, when the envelope fabric is torn, burn as much propane as possible to minimize the speed of your descent., It can take a surprising amount of practice to develop the ability to tell the precise direction of travel in mid-flight, let alone select a landing site and successfully guide the balloon to that destination.There are several approaches and techniques you'll need to learn to land in various conditions, and an experienced teacher is vital. Begin by practicing in best conditions, with a large landing space that you can glide across at a gentle downward slope. Vent the air slowly and keep your eye on the tallest nearby obstacle, even if it's slightly to the side. Once you've cleared the obstacle, you can vent as needed, but aim for a steady, controlled glide.As you touch ground — and prepare for a bumpy ride, vent the rest of the air off to deflate the envelope. Congratulations! You now know the basics of flying a balloon.

Rinse the soybeans.,
Soak the soybeans overnight.,

Roll the soybeans between your fingers.,
Use a spoon to skim out the skins.,
Place the beans and four cups of water into the blender.,
Run the blender on high for one minute.,
Set up the strainer.,

Set aside the soy paste.,
Put the pot of soy milk over medium low heat.,
Bring to a boil and add salt and flavorings.,
Simmer for 20 minutes.,
Let the soy milk cool.,
Scoop off any film on the top.,
Serve the soy milk cold.",How to Make Soy Milk," Pour the bag of soybeans into a colander and run the beans under cool water. Use your hands to mix the soybeans around so that all the beans get rinsed.





;
, After rinsing the beans, place them in a large bowl. Pour enough cool water to completely cover the beans, about 4 cups. Then leave them to soak undisturbed overnight, or for at least 12 hours.








Soaking the beans makes them easier to de-hull and also makes it easier to blend them to make the milk.

, After 12 hours, the soybeans should be softer and should be twice their original size. Use a knife to cut through a soybean. If it is soft and easy to cut through, the beans are done. If the bean is still tough, allow the beans to soak longer and check every hour or so until the beans have soaked enough., After you soak the soybeans, place a colander in the sink and pour the soybeans into the colander, letting the water drain. Then transfer the beans into a large bowl and cover the soybeans in water.







, Before blending the soybeans, many prefer to remove the thin skins of the soybeans since it improves the texture of the milk. To remove the skins, rub the beans between your two hands to loosen the husks.








You can individually pick the skins off the beans as you rub them, or you can drop the beans back into the water. The loosened skins will come off and float to the surface of the water.

, After you have finished rolling the beans, you should see a layer of soybean skins floating on the water. Use your hand or a spoon to scoop the skins out of the water.








It’s ok if you have missed a few skins, or if a few of the beans still have their husks. This won’t dramatically affect the milk.

, After you have de-hulled the soybeans, pour the beans into the blender, and fill the blender with four cups of water. Place the top on the blender.









If your blender isn’t big enough to hold four cups of water, put in half the soybeans and two cups of water. After you have finished blending the first batch, do a second batch.

, Blend the soybeans on high for at least a minute. After a minute, take the top off the blender and check the soy milk. The milk should look frothy, and there should be no chunks of bean.









If the mixture doesn’t look completely blended, blend for another fifteen seconds and check again.

, Even though the beans are completely blended, you will need to strain the soy milk to achieve a smooth texture. Place a sheet of cheesecloth or muslin over a fine strainer, then place the strainer over a pot.







, Carefully pour the blended soy milk over the cheesecloth and into the pot. After you have finished pouring, bring all the corners of the cheesecloth together and twist over the pot. This should release more soy milk into the pot.








, After you have finished wringing out the cheesecloth, open it up to see the soy paste that is left inside, also called okara. Okara can be used to make a number of different foods, from veggie burgers to crackers.If you have no use for the okara, you can dispose of it.

, Place the soy milk on the oven over medium low heat. Stir from time to time, and keep an eye on the pot because soy milk can bubble over quickly.







, After the soy milk has begun to boil, turn the heat down to simmer. Add a pinch of salt along with additional flavorings if you choose. Many add some sugar, since store-bought soy milk usually contains extra sugar.You can also add a teaspoon of vanilla extract, a stick of cinnamon, or even a few tablespoons of melted chocolate to give the soy milk additional flavor.

, After you have turned down the heat and added the flavors, let the soy milk simmer for another 20 minutes. This will mellow out the flavor of the soy milk so it tastes less “beany.”, Turn off the heat after 20 minutes and take the pot of soy milk off the burner. Set it aside and let it cool. After it has come to room temperature you can pour it in a pitcher and put it in the fridge., Once the soy milk has cooled, examine the top of the liquid. If you see any skin or film on top of the milk, skim it off with a spoon and discard it.








, After the film is removed, the soy milk is ready to be served! Serve it up cold in a glass or enjoy it in smoothies or as a substitute for milk. Store any unused soy milk in the fridge for up to a week."

Soften the ice cream.,
Put three scoops of the ice cream into your blender.,
Pulse the ingredients in your blender until well-mixed.,
Transfer the milkshake into the chilled glass.",How to Make a Shake1," There are three good ways to soften up ice cream for use in a shake. You can transfer the tub of ice cream from the freezer to the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes. Another option would be to take the ice cream out and let it sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes. If your ice cream is very hard, put it in the microwave for about 30 seconds, setting the power to 30%.You want the ice cream to be softened but not runny.
As you’re softening the ice cream, place your shake glass into the freezer to get it cold and frosty.
Low-fat ice cream and frozen yogurt can be substituted for the ice cream.;
, This doesn’t have to be exact – three heaping scoops works perfectly. Then add 2 ounces of milk and your choice of flavorings to the blender. Popular choices for flavorings are crushed cookies, chocolate syrup, shredded coconut and crushed candy pieces. You can use as much or as little of your chosen add-ins that you want.

Refrain from adding ice to thin out your shake.
If you want it to be thinner, add a little more milk until you reach the desired consistency.

, If you like your milkshakes to be thick, blend the ingredients on a low speed. The low speed mixes the ingredients into the ice cream effectively without changing the consistency too much, keeping it nice and thick. For a lighter, fluffy shake, blend the ingredients on high speed until mixed well.When using a low speed, you may need to stop once or twice to push your flavorings to the bottom of the blender with a spatula.
If you don’t have a regular blender, you can also use a stick-blender (also known as an immersion hand blender).

, Carefully pour your blended shake into the frosty glass. If you’d like, top off the shake with whipped cream, chocolate syrup, and/or your chosen add-ins. Serve immediately.

If you opted to make a very thick shake, you may need to serve the shake with a spoon.
If you’d like to make an adult milkshake – one with alcohol – skip the milk and use a splash of the liquor of your choice instead.

Gather your ingredients.,
Use whey protein powder.,
Make a Wild Berry shake with whey protein.,
Use natural protein sources.,
Make a Peanut Butter Banana Shake.",How to Make a Shake2," There are two ways you can approach protein shakes. The first way is using pre-purchased protein supplements, like whey protein and flavored protein powders. The second way is using natural sources of protein, such as chia seeds, peanut butter and milk. Supplements deliver an extremely large amount of protein and are usually favored by body builders and workout enthusiasts.

Natural protein sources offer a high amount of protein for the average person who isn’t weight training.

, Whey protein is one of the two proteins found naturally in milk. The body absorbs this type of protein faster than other protein sources, which results in increased muscle protein synthesis. Whey protein also provides a large amount of the amino acid L-cysteine, which can improve deficiencies caused by many conditions, most notably aging and diabetes.It can also be beneficial for those with depression, blood pressure, blood sugar and can also help to treat symptoms of HIV and cancer.Whey protein supplements aren’t known to cause liver or kidney damage.
However, if you have pre-existing liver or kidney damage, whey protein supplements may worsen it. Consult your doctor before proceeding.

, Wash the berries well and place them into the blender, along with the rest of the ingredients. Pulse the blender on low until the ingredients are mixed well. Pour into a glass and serve immediately. Feel free to adjust the fruit ingredients to your liking.


Consider adding a banana before blending your shake.
The banana will up your fruit intake and result in a slightly thicker shake.

, Many people have no reason or desire to protein-load their bodies with the amount of protein a body builder aims to intake. Unless you have a specific reason for doing so, the average person should not use these supplements, since they may put a strain on the kidneys and liver. Furthermore, protein from food sources is more nutritionally beneficial than supplements.

Protein shakes, made with natural sources, benefit most adults.
Most people don’t get the recommended amount of protein, 45 to 50 grams, in their daily diet.The minimum recommended daily amount (RDA) is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. To calculate your RDA, multiply your weight in pounds by 0.36.
Keep in mind that the RDA is the bare minimum you should take in each day. Experts say that you should get at least twice your RDA in protein for best results., Peel the banana, cut it into large chunks and put it into the blender. Add all of the remaining ingredients. Set the blender on its lowest setting and pulse the ingredients until they are blended well. Pour the shake into a glass and serve immediately.

The natural protein sources in this shake are chia seeds, peanut butter, yogurt and milk.
This recipe can be made fully vegan by using soy yogurt and dairy-free milk. "

Assemble your frappé.",How to Make a Frappe1," To make your frappé, you will need about 1 1/2 cups of coffee. As a general guideline, use 4 tbsp. coffee per 6 ounces of water or 1 1/2 cups cold-brewed coffee concentrate.You can use fresh or instant coffee. Here are some things to consider:


""Filter"" coffee refers to coffee beans that have been roasted and ground to be used in coffee making machines. This is fresh coffee and may have a variety of qualities not found in instant coffee, like sweeter or more distinct flavors.
""Instant"" coffee refers to a coffee that has already been made and is dried (usually by freezing) into a dehydrated state. Instant coffee is recommended as a back-up to the fresh stuff.
Use stronger coffee to give your frappé a stronger coffee flavor.;
, Cold brewing your coffee is a process that requires about 12 hours.To make cold brewed coffee:


Add 1 cup of coarsely ground coffee beans to a large bowl and pour in 4 cups of cold water.
Stir until combined and cover in the refrigerator for 12 hours.
Take the bowl out of the refrigerator and place a strainer or coffee filter over another bowl. Slowly pour your coffee over the strainer and let the liquid filter through the strainer. Discard the grounds and remove the strainer.
Cold brewed coffee can be very strong. Dilute at a 1:3 or 1:2 coffee/water ratio. Refrigerate for up to 1 week.

, This method is called Japanese-style iced coffee and can be made much quicker than the previous method.To brew Japanese-style cold brewed coffee:


Use a kitchen scale to measure 8 ounces of ice.
Measure about 1.8 grams of freshly roasted coffee for every ounce of iced coffee you'd like.
Grind coffee beans until medium coarse. For about 16 ounces of iced coffee, use about 30 grams of coffee. One level tablespoon is roughly 5 grams.
Put your ice in a large glass and place a secure a coffee filter over the top.
Brew your coffee hot and pour it over the filter into the cup of ice.
Not all of the ice might melt, but by the end you should have a cold cup of coffee.

, Adding your sugar to your coffee while it's still hot will help it dissolve faster.Pour in two tbsp. of sugar, honey, stevia, or whatever sweetener you prefer.


If you have brewed your coffee in a coffee maker, you can pour your sweetener right into the coffee pot and stir it in.

, If starting with hot freshly brewed coffee, the fastest method will still take you about 20 minutes. To chill your coffee, try:


In an ice tray. Pour your coffee into an ice tray and put it into the freezer until frozen. This method takes a few hours, but will create a stronger tasting drink because you won't need to add any additional ice.
In a skillet. Once you have brewed your coffee, pour it into a wide, shallow skillet and let it sit. This method spreads your hot liquid over a large surface area, allowing it to cool more quickly than it would in a coffee pot.This method can cool your coffee significantly after about 20 mins.
You can also place your skillet in the freezer for about 20 minutes to chill it completely.
You can also chill your skillet ahead of time to quicken the process.

, Add your chilled coffee to a blender and pour in 1/2 cup of milk. You can use regular milk, soy, almond milk, or any other milk you prefer.

, If you have chilled your coffee in an ice tray, you won't need to add any ice. Start by adding about 1 1/2 cups of ice.Remember, the more ice you add, the more your coffee will become diluted, resulting in a less flavorful frappé.

, Put the lid on and blend your mixture until smooth, adding more ice if you desire a thicker consistency.

, Pour your frappé mixture into a tall glass. You can chill your glass in the freezer for a few minutes beforehand if you prefer. Top it off with a dash of whipped cream and enjoy with a straw!

Break apart your chopsticks.,
Rub the chopsticks together to remove splinters.,

Shovel rice with chopsticks.,
Avoid letting the chopsticks cross while grasping food.,
Do not impale food with a chopstick.,
Do not place your chopsticks upright in rice.,
Do not leave your chopsticks crossed on your plate or bowl.,
Do not wash chopsticks in drinks or soup.,
Avoid passing food from chopstick to chopstick.",How to Use Wooden Chopsticks," Pick up your chopsticks, holding one chopstick in each hand. Press forward on one stick while pulling the stick closer to you backwards. Your chopsticks should break apart down the middle. Also, make sure to lower the sticks to your knees before breaking them to avoid hitting any dishes on the table., There are sometimes splinters near where the chopsticks broke. If you notice any splinters on your chopsticks, gently rub the chopsticks together a few times to remove them.








However, when using nicer wooden chopsticks, especially non-disposable ones, avoid rubbing them together., Contrary to popular belief, you are not supposed to break off the wood block at the end of your chopsticks. The wood does not break off easily and can cause your chopsticks to splinter and even break. Do not touch the wood block at the end of your chopsticks after breaking them apart.







, Wooden chopsticks are held and used in the same fashion as any other type of chopstick. Hold the first chopstick with the tips of your index and middle finger. Use the tip of your thumb to keep the chopstick balanced in a straight line across your hand.








Don't worry if you don't get it right immediately. It takes some practice to correctly balance chopsticks.

, Your second chopstick should be placed below the first one. Place it between your thumb and palm, moving your thumb inward towards the palm to firmly hold the chopstick in place. This chopstick does not move when you eat.








Again, do not sweat it if it's hard at first. It does take a little practice.

, Once you're holding your chopsticks correctly, make sure you can maneuver them correctly. Only the top chopstick should move and you should only use your index and middle finger to move it. Your thumb should remain still.








It can take some practice to use chopsticks correctly. Give yourself time to practice the basic motions before handling food. Strive to be aware of your thumb and to keep it still. This will allow you to have better control of the chopsticks.
If you're used to using a different type of chopstick, like ceramic chopsticks, it may take awhile to adjust to the new texture.

, Using chopsticks is simple once you have the basic motions down. You simply move the upper chopstick with your index and middle finger to separate the chopsticks. Then, grab food between the upper and lower chopstick and bring it to your plate or mouth.








While this seems simple, do not get frustrated if it takes time to master. Using chopsticks can be tricky at first, especially if you've always used forks and spoons in the past. Give yourself time to get used to the movement.

, In most Asian countries, rice can be pushed into your mouth with chopsticks. When eating rice, hold the bowl face level. Hold your chopsticks side by side and gently push the rice into your mouth.








However, this is not considered appropriate in Korean culture, so do not do this when eating in a Korean restaurant.

, When picking up food with your chopsticks, make sure the ends do not cross over one another and make an ""X"". This will make it very difficult to pick up food. If your chopsticks cross at the ends, you're gripping your food too tightly. Let go of the food and try to grab it again more gently., While it seems like an easy solution if you're having trouble grasping food, never use a chopstick to impale food and bring it to your mouth. As this is not what chopsticks are designed for, food can easily slip off if you use chopsticks like this. It is also generally considered bad manners., In some Buddhist cultures, rice is offered to someone's spirit at a shrine after death. When rice is offered to a spirit, chopsticks are left sitting upright in rice. In general, avoid placing chopsticks upright in rice, as this could potentially be seen as insulting to Buddhist cultures.








Not everyone who uses chopsticks practices Buddhism, but it's always best to err on the side of caution, especially if you're eating in a restaurant where the culture is unfamiliar to you.

, Chopsticks crossed on a bowl or plate are sometimes used in funeral rituals in Asian cultures. While not all Asian cultures practice such rituals, it's a good idea to avoid crossing your chopsticks just in case. If you're not eating, set your chopsticks side by side near your plate instead of leaving them crossed on the plate.







, It is generally considered unsanitary to wash your chopsticks in your drinks or your soup after using them. If your chopsticks are dirty, wipe them off with a napkin or get a clean pair instead of contaminating soup or water with food particles.







, Some Buddhist funeral rites involve passing the bones of the deceased from chopstick to chopstick after cremation. Therefore, it's generally considered a faux pas to pass food between chopsticks as this can be a reminder of death and funerals.

Chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.,
Garnish with whipped cream, if desired.",How to Make a Shamrock Shake2," Before you begin making the shake itself, get your serving glass ready by placing it in the refrigerator or freezer until it feels cold.


Keep the glass in the refrigerator for 30 to 40 minutes.
Keep the glass in the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes.
Note that cups made of glass will get colder at a faster rate than those made from plastic.
Make sure the glass you choose will be tall enough to fit the entire milkshake.

, Once your glass has been chilled, pour in the cold milk.


Any dairy milk will work for this recipe: whole, 2 percent, 1 percent, and fat-free. You could also try soymilk or almond milk for a dairy-free alternative, but these options may slightly alter the final texture of the milk shake.

, Add the pistachio instant pudding to the milk in your glass and stir, continuously and rapidly, for 2 to 3 minutes.The pudding mix must be completely dissolved. As it dissolves, it should start to thicken up the milk, but the effect may not be noticeable at first.
The shake gets its flavor and color from the pudding mix.

, You can enjoy the pistachio shamrock shake as is, but if you want a thicker shake, you should let the drink sit in the refrigerator for 30 to 60 minutes. As it sets, the shake will thicken a great deal more.


To speed the process up, you could also try sticking the shake in the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes. You do not want the shake frozen solid. You only want it to get cold enough to thicken up a little.

, Serve immediately and top with a generous portion of whipped cream, if desired.

Combine 2 Tbsp (30 ml) mint syrup with the ice cream, milk, whiskey, mint extract, and food coloring.,
Garnish with whipped cream and a cherry, if desired.",How to Make a Shamrock Shake3," Heat on medium, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves completely.


This could take anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes.

, Let the syrup sit in your refrigerator for about an hour, or until it feels cool.


If you want to cool the syrup down faster, place it in the freezer for 20 minutes.
Before chilling the syrup, make sure that you transfer it into a heatproof bowl. If you use a plastic bowl, the heat from the syrup could cause the plastic to start melting.

, Once the syrup feels cool, pour it through a strainer or small colander. Collect the syrup in a bowl beneath the strainer and filter out the leaves.


You only need 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of this syrup for your shamrock shake. The rest can be saved in a sealed container for another dish, though.
Discard the mint leaves you strained out.

, Add the ingredients to an electric blender and whip together on a high speed for 15 to 30 seconds, or until thoroughly combined.


Taste the shake before serving it. If the mint flavor is not strong enough, you can add more mint syrup or more mint extract. If the alcohol taste is not strong enough, you can add a bit more whiskey. Be aware, though, that adding more liquid will cause your shake to thin out.

, Pour the shamrock shake into one or two serving glasses. Decorate each one with a generous helping of whipped cream topping and a bright red maraschino cherry.

Blend in the ice.,
Enjoy immediately.",How to Make a Shamrock Shake4," Combine these four ingredients in your blender and mix on a medium setting until they are well combined. This could take about 15 to 20 seconds.


Using yogurt instead of ice cream reduces the fat content of the shake while adding more calcium and probiotics.Using low-fat or nonfat milk cuts down on the number of calories in the shake.
Natural sweeteners like raw honey and agave reduce the sugar and number of calories in your shake. The result is a shake with a low glycemic index, making it safer for people with diabetes or those who are at risk for diabetes.

, Drop 2 or 3 drops of green food coloring into the shake and blend for another 10 to 15 seconds, or until evenly dispersed.


You can skip the green food coloring altogether if you are worried about including dyes in your food.

, Add 5 ice cubes to the blender and blend on high until the ice is fully chopped and dispersed through the blender. This could take a few minutes.


If the shake is not thick enough to suit your preferences even after the ice is mixed in, blend in another two ice cubes.
Note that you may need to pause your blender and stir the contents with a rubber spatula to ensure the top and bottom of the mixture are being evenly blended.

, As soon as the shake is done, transfer it into a serving glass and enjoy.

Transfer into serving glasses and sprinkle with cacao nibs.",How to Make a Shamrock Shake5," Peel the banana and cut it into 2-inch (5-cm) chunks. Place these frozen banana chunks in your freezer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until they become frozen solid.


You should tray freeze the bananas to prevent them from sticking together. Cover a small cookie sheet with parchment paper and arrange the banana chunks on the sheet in a single layer. Do not let the pieces touch.
Stick the cookie sheet in the freezer. Done in this manner, the banana pieces should freeze separately, making them easier to blend into the shake.

, Blend on high speed until smooth and evenly colored.


This should take anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes, depending on the speed and strength of your blender.
The coconut milk ice cream and almond milk remove dairy from the equation.
The spinach and avocado give the shamrock shake a great green color without the use of dyes.
The cacao nibs add a hint of milk chocolate flavor, which complements the taste of mint.

, Pour your shake into serving glasses and serve immediately. If desired, sprinkle each shake with additional cacao nibs before serving for an added boost of chocolate flavor.

Choose a variety.,
Decide on a roast level.,
Buy fresh, whole beans.",How to Make Strong Coffee1," Robusta beans have a bolder taste and up to twice the caffeine of arabica, but most are bitter and less appealing.If you're not a coffee snob and want a more powerful morning kick, you can probably find an acceptable blend with up to 15% robusta. If you prefer a brighter taste, stick to 100% arabica.


Opinion is divided among espresso fans, but many do prefer a significant amount of robusta.;
, Despite popular myths, roasting barely affects caffeine content, except for a small decrease after an extremely dark roast.Most people still consider a dark roast ""strong"" because of its bold, bitter taste. Medium or light roasts won't punch you in the teeth, but they'll keep you just as alert.


Keep in mind that it's much easier for a roaster to ruin the flavor with a fully dark roast. Medium-dark roasts (including Vienna and Full-City roasts) also make a strong brew, but tend to have more complex flavor overtones as well.

, Recently roasted beans have a much more powerful, enjoyable flavor. Try to use all your coffee within one or two weeks to maintain a bold experience.This has no effect on caffeine levels.
To keep the beans fresh, store in an airtight container away from light, at room temperature. Try a ceramic container with a metal and rubber latch."

, The server will probably make a banal comment such as ""How are you today?"" They are trying to initiate conversation to develop a rapport with you. A simple response such as ""I'm doing great, thanks"" will suffice. Respond to the server when they make this conversation. If you simply start demanding food, you will probably be considered rude.

, After this dialogue, they will ask you what you would like to drink. If you aren't quite sure, just say so. Don't ponder too long, and avoid using interjections. Don't say, ""What do you have?"" All restaurants have the same basic beverages; water, soda, juice, coffee and usually a bar. If there isn't a particular drink, they will let you know.


If your group is splitting the check, now is a good time to mention that.

, Use the menu; that is what it's for. When you know what you would like, close your menu and place it on the table. This signals to the waiter that you are ready to order. If you leave it open, they will assume you are still looking it over and will not come to your table.

, Do not make the waiter try to decipher your mumbling, and do not simply point at a listing in the menu. Use your words. If there are children at the table, order for them. Avoid saying ""Tell the man/woman what you want, sweetie.""

, They have a system; typically starting with the women and then going from there. Refrain your whole table from yelling out what they want at the same time. This is rude, confusing, and will make your server irritated with your table. This is also the time to ask any questions you have about the food. Ten minutes later is not the time to inform him of your peanut allergy.

, Your order has been placed and your beverages are at your table. Enjoy the conversation with your friends and/or family and understand that your food is coming. You do not need to call your waiter over to see if it's done yet or to ask how much longer it will be. When it is ready, they will bring it to the table. Trust your server; they want your food to get to you quickly just as much as you do. The sooner it comes out, the sooner you eat and the sooner they can turn the table over and make more money.

, Do not eat half of the chicken club sandwich before you realize that you ordered a burger. When the food is placed, think for a moment about what else you may need during the course of the meal. Ketchup, mayonnaise, fresh pepper, extra napkins, more soda refills? These are all requests that you should ask your server for now. They can get them all in one trip instead of five of them. If you make them do that, they will grow to resent you.

, This would be when you ask for your medium rare burger to be cooked more because it ""has too much pink in it."" Or this would be the time to tell them that french fries are ""ice cold"" or that you need more salad dressing because the salad has ""no dressing on it whatsoever.""

, Do not try to help them by stacking them; it doesn't help them. They have their own method for clearing plates, so let them do it their way. Don't disappoint; it is very much appreciated that you want to help, but don't bother. Also avoid cracking jokes like ""Oh, it was horrible"" as they clear a plate that you obviously licked clean. It's a trite joke that every waiter has heard hundreds of times and it's never considered funny by the servers.

, If you want it, have it. If you don't, don't. They do not care either way.

, Do not argue amongst yourselves about who owes whom or who paid the last time. Do not thrust several credit cards at them, shouting over others, ""No, take this one!"" They will take which ever one touches their hand first because they do not care who pays for the check as long as it gets paid. If you want separate checks, you should have specified so when you first ordered. Use a calculator to figure it out, or check the receipt to see who ordered what.

, In most cases in the United States and other tipping countries, fifteen to twenty percent is expected. If you don't think that tipping is something you should be responsible for, then a fast food restaurant is probably more appropriate for you. In some states (such as California, where the tax rate is 9.25%), a good way to figure out the tip is to look at the tax and then double it. Or you can use a smartphone app or calculator if the math is too complicated for you.


It is never acceptable to ""stiff"" your waiter. If you have a problem, ask for the manager and let them do the reprimanding. By not tipping at all you are also not tipping the bartender, busser, and/or food runner, whom get tipped out by the waiter.

, This is also a good time to see if your child left a pile of Cheerios or french fries on the floor. If you left more than a twenty percent tip, feel free to leave the mess. The janitors/cleaners are paid with your tip to clean the mess and you should not move a muscle to do so. If you left ten percent or less, then it's expected that you clean the mess up. Such a low tip is not appreciated by workers and even other customers occasionally.

This is its home until either you need to go to the restroom, or the meal has finished.;
, During the meal, it will be customary that you will need to wipe your mouth at certain promptings. To wipe your mouth, gently dab your mouth and allow the napkin to soak residue from the area. It is also vital that you use your napkin before sipping your wine or other beverage, so you don’t leave any greasy mouth excess on the lip of the glass.

, At no stage during the meal should you use your napkin like a tissue as a means to blow your nose. Simply excuse yourself from the table if you need to, and visit the bathroom instead.

, If you do need to take a trip to the restroom during the meal, excuse yourself from the table and place your napkin neatly on the lap of your seat (not the arm or the top) until you return. Never place it back onto the table during the meal.

Grind fresh and fine.,

Drink right away.,
Check your system for even extraction.,
Try a specialized brewing method.",How to Make Strong Coffee2," To keep the flavor strong, grind only when you're about to brew. The finer you grind the coffee, the faster the flavor extraction, since the water comes into contact with more surface area. If your coffee is too weak for your tastes, grind to a slightly finer consistency next time.


If you make the grind too fine, you'll extract overpowering bitter flavors. Typically, a medium grind (beach sand consistency) works well for drip brewing, and a coarse grind (kosher salt) is best for a French press or other long extraction method.The finer the grind, the more likely you are to end up with grounds at the bottom of your cup. You can swirl these in, sip at the end for a strong kick, or just leave the last few drops.

, A typical strong cup of coffee uses 1 unit of coffee for 16 units of water, measured by weight.For a single serving, this means 11 grams (0.38 ounces) coffee for 180 mL water (6 fluid ounces or ¾ cup). If this is still too weak, you can increase the amount of coffee next time.


As a rough measurement, use a 30 mL (2 tbsp) scoop of coffee grounds for 180 mL (6 ounces) water. Volume measurements are less accurate, so you may not get a consistent strength each time.
The extreme fringe of strong coffee fans uses a ratio of 2.5 to 6, but most people will find this much too overpowering and caffeinated.1 milliliter of water weighs 1 gram, so you can measure the water with a metric measuring cup without changing the math.

, Hotter water extracts flavors more quickly. Most brewing methods assume you are using water between 195º and 205ºF (91–96ºC).An infrared thermometer is the best way to check water temperature, but you can get away with trial and error. Water cools quickly in most kettles, reaching perfect temperature within 10–30 seconds after boiling.


Do not raise temperature about 205ºF (96ºC), or you will burn the coffee and lose flavor.
If you're more than 4,000 feet (1200 meters) above sea level, pour the water as soon as it boils.

, There's a sweet spot where most of the flavor has dissolved into the water, but the unpleasant flavor compounds are still locked in the grounds. This can take a little experimentation to find. Aim for 2–4 minutes of contact if using a French press, and 5 minutes if using a pour over (drip) system.Lengthening this will lead to a stronger flavor, but it's easy to overshoot and end up flat and bitter.


For more detail, read our articles on French press, pour over coffee, or coffee makers.

, Coffee loses flavor fast, especially at high temperatures. To keep it tasting strong instead of flat, drink right after brewing. If you need to keep it longer, hold it in an insulated container at 185ºF (85ºC)., If you're using a coffee maker or a pour over method, make sure the water falls in an even stream and wets all grounds evenly. In any system, you can try mixing the grounds so there are no hard-packed areas that disrupt water flow., If none of these tips solve your problem, try a different brewing method. Here are a few options for the strong coffee lover:



The AeroPress makes coffee on the strong side, as a French press does, but is much faster to use.

Turkish coffee is made with fine grounds left in the cup, making the strongest coffee you can have short of espresso.

Cold brew coffee creates a strong cup without some of the unpleasant flavors from over-extraction. This can take 24 hours.

Choose a coffee or coffees.,
Consider your water.,
Complete a dry run.,
Measure your coffee out.,
Decide how many pods you want to make.",How to Make Your Own Coffee Pods1," Locate a stainless steel scooping cup that roughly fits your coffeemaker’s podholder. It’s okay if the scooper is not exactly the same size as the podholder. The scooper is just going to act as a mold for part of your pod., Buy some high quality coffee filters to make your pods. If you can locate thicker ones that resemble the material that makes up store-bought pods, then those will work better. If you can’t find them, try to find the thickest filters possible. You don’t want your pod turning upside down inside your coffee maker.


Avoid thin and flimsy coffee filters.
Avoid large filters.
Don’t make your own filters at home, as household materials might include chemicals not suited for consumption., This object needs to be small enough to fit into the stainless steel scooper. Any object will really work. You won’t be using this as part of your pod, but rather, it’ll be used to shape your coffee filters. Consider:


Small glasses.
Empty vitamin bottle.
An old coffee pod.
Small glass jars., This is one of the best parts of the homemade coffee pod – you can pick whatever coffee you want. You can choose between storebought pre-ground coffee or coffee beans.


Feel free to combine flavors.
Feel free to combine caffeinated and decaffeinated.
If you choose beans, make sure you grind them very finely.
Add extra spices and extracts, if you want., Expert coffee makers often comment upon how the quality of water helps determine the quality and taste of coffee. You should take this into account when getting ready to make your coffee pods. If the tap water in your home is has a strong smell or taste, consider the following:


Use filtered water.
Use bottled spring water.
If you must use tap water, run the tap for a few seconds before gathering water for your coffee., Before you get to podmaking, you should try everything out to see if it works without coffee. Take all of your supplies, including the scooper, the cylindrical object, and a filter, and see if they all fit together. This way, if you have some sort of equipment failure, there won’t be much of a mess to clean up.


Place the scooper on a flat surface.
Place the filter in the scooper.
Place the cylindrical object into the filter.
They should all fit snug.

, How much you measure depends on a couple of factors, including the type of coffee, how much coffee you’d like to brew, and how strong you like your coffee. Consider the following:


2 tablespoons for 6 ounces of water (one cup of coffee).
3 tablespoons for 9 ounces of water (a large cup of coffee).
Use more or less if you’d like your coffee weaker or stronger., Making your own pods is the opportunity to save yourself a lot of money and time. Importantly, before you make your pods, you should decide how many you want to make. Plan ahead and make sure to have enough filters and coffee.

Make sure there are no large wrinkles or creases in the bottom of the filter.
The jar is used to give form to your filter.
Make sure your filter does not have any holes in it.

, Place your scooping cup next to the jar and filter on a flat surface. Carefully pick up the filter and jar and place them inside the scooping cup.


Make sure there are no large wrinkles or creases when you place the filter in the cup.
The coffee filter will be separating the jar from the steel cup.
The sides of the filter will be up around the sides of the cylindrical object.

, At this point, your steel scooping cup will be on the bottom, the filter will be next, and the jar will be inside the filter. It is very important that everything fits snugly and properly. It is also very important that there are not creases or folders on the bottom of the filter.

, Very gently and slowly, slide your jar upward out of the coffee filter. Make sure that your filter stays snugly in the steel cup and maintains its shape. When you are done, you should have the steel cup sitting on your surface and the filter sitting within it. The sides of the filter should look as if they are molded toward the cylindrical object that is no longer there.

, Take your pre-measured coffee grinds and fill your coffee filter. Make sure to fill it to your previously decided specifications and don’t over or under fill at the last minute. You should only use either 2 or 3 tablespoons per filter, depending on how much you want your pods to produce. Any more or less coffee might cause problems.

, Now that you’ve got your filter shaped and filled, you need to fold it closed. Fold it closed carefully. Try to make creases and fold it so the filter will stay closed. Consider the following:


Do not use tape, glue, or any other sort of adhesive.
Avoid household paperclips or staples.
If you don’t think your fold will close, track down stainless steel, uncoated, clips that are appropriate to use when cooking., Now that you’ve closed the filter, use your hand to compact the filter into the stainless steel scooper. This will help hold the form of the pod and make it easier to handle. It will also lessen the chances of your folds coming undone and your coffee grounds spilling everywhere., Now that you’ve folded and pressed down on your filter, you’ve got your first coffee pod! Remove it from the stainless steel scooper and pop it in your coffee maker. Press start, and enjoy!

, If you’ve made extra pods, you need to take care to store them properly. While store-bought pods can be stored out in the open, you need to put a little more effort into your home made pods. Consider the following:


Store them in an airtight container.
Store them in a dry, room temperature environment.
If you want to store them in the refrigerator or freezer, make sure that they are indeed in an airtight container."

Enjoy the tea.",How to Prepare Oolong Tea," For most tea drinkers, a ceramic teapot and cup will provide a good experience. Alternatively, you can put an infuser in your cup and brew a single serving directly. You can use any infuser, but a large cup-shaped insert works well as it allows the leaves to expand.If you're a serious tea drinker interested in learning the Chinese tea ceremony, look for a Yixing clay teapot. Many consider this the best way to drink Oolong, but only if you handle them carefully.;
, The best tea is rarely sold in bags, so it's best to look for a loose leaf Oolong, of which there are many varieties. The amount you use depends on personal preference. To start out, try the following amount of tea for every 180 mL (6 ounces) water:If the leaves are rolled into balls, put in 2 tsp (10 mL).
If the leaves are rolled into wiry strips, put in 1¼ to 2 Tbsp (18–30 mL).
If the leaves look mostly whole or broken, put in 1 to 2 Tbsp (15–30 mL).
If you have a kitchen scale, you can measure out 2-3 grams of tea regardless of appearance.

, Filtered water is usually a good option, while some tea drinkers prefer distilled. You can try it with regular tap water, but chlorine or other impurities and additives can impair the taste of the tea.

, This temperature is ideal for brewing Oolong without breaking down its fragile aromatic chemicals. If your kettle does not have a temperature control, watch the surface of the water and remove it from heat when you see ""ropes of pearls,"" or streams of large bubbles rising to the water surface.As a general rule, Oolongs with lighter colored leaves work better with water at the low end of this range, when the bubbles are smaller but still forming ropes.This visual test only works near sea level. Above 3,000 feet (915m), just bring the water to a rolling boil and use immediately.Alternatively, bring your water to a rolling boil, open the lid, then let cool for two minutes. This is not ideal, since the method is less accurate and the water loses some oxygen when it boils.

, Pour a tiny bit of hot water onto your leaves, and immediately pour it down the drain without losing any leaves. (This is easy with an infuser: just let the water drain through.) This rinse opens up the cellular structure of the tea leaves, and washes away any impurities.

, Now you can pour in enough hot water to fill the container, typically about 180 mL (6 ounces) per serving of tea. Let steep for anywhere from two to five minutes, depending on how concentrated you prefer your tea.


This is the Western style of brewing. The Asian method generally uses a larger amount of Oolong, then drinks it in a series of small cups brewed for 30–60 seconds each., Appreciate the aroma and bright color of the tea, then sip away. If you find the taste is too powerful, use fewer leaves or a shorter steeping time on your next cup. If the tea is too watery for your tastes, use more leaves or a longer steeping time.

Enjoy.",How to Make Vietnamese Coffee," Dark roasted, whole bean Vietnamese coffee works best. Whole beans should be coarsely ground and then immediately used to make your Vietnamese coffee. This provides the freshest cup. In general, it is difficult to find a Vietnamese whole bean coffee but there are a few brands available.


Avoid fine ground coffee since the granules will fall through the gaps of the coffee press and contaminate the coffee itself.
You should also avoid light roasts since they'll likely be overwhelmed by the sweetness of the condensed milk. Medium roasts will suffice, and dark roasts are the most conventional.;
, If you plan to make hot Vietnamese coffee, submerge the coffee mug in hot water for 5 to 10 minutes before using it.


Preheating the mug in this manner allows the coffee to retain more heat after it brews. If you do not preheat the cup, the resulting coffee might seem lukewarm.
Do not preheat the glass if you plan on preparing iced coffee, however.

, Fill roughly 1/3 inch (1 cm) of the glass with sweetened condensed milk. This amount should remain the same regardless of whether you serve the coffee hot or iced.


You must use sweetened condensed milk, not evaporated milk. The latter isn't sweet enough to balance the bitterness of the coffee.
When preparing iced coffee, consider chilling the condensed milk in your refrigerator before adding it to the glass. Doing so will help drop the temperature of the hot coffee more rapidly.

, Remove the lid and the top screen of the coffee filter, revealing the open chamber beneath. Set aside both pieces until later.


The 'cà phê phin, or Vietnamese coffee filter, consists of three main parts: a filtered chamber, an upper screen, and a lid.


, Make sure that the holes of the filter are positioned directly over the mouth of the glass.


Note that the chamber should have a large ring around its outer base. When setting it up, make sure that this ring sits around the rim of the glass.

, Fill the open filter with 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of ground coffee.


The exact amount should vary depending on your personal taste, but traditional Vietnamese coffee is quite strong, so it would be appropriate to use more coffee grounds than you might use for a standard cup of coffee.
Also note that you may wish to use more coffee grounds when preparing iced Vietnamese coffee than you'd use when preparing hot Vietnamese coffee. As the ice melts, it can dilute the drink, causing its flavor to gradually weaken.If the coffee blend you use doesn't have chicory and you wish to add it, do so now by mixing it directly into the chamber with the ground.

, Evenly spread a spoonful of water over the grounds. Wait approximately 20 seconds for the grounds to absorb the water and begin swelling.


This step isn't strictly necessary, but following it can result in a stronger, deeper flavor.

, Screw the top screen back onto the filter chamber, making it snug without becoming too tight.


Press the screen into the chamber, flattening the grounds in the process. Screw it down until it compresses the coffee grounds, then unscrew it by one full turn to create some headspace and regulate the brewing time.
Using this screen is essential since it helps distribute the water more evenly throughout the grounds. It also helps prevent the grounds from sticking to the sides of the chamber as they water level decreases.

, Boil 1 cup (250 ml) of water in a kettle or saucepan, then remove it from the heat. Let it sit and cool for approximately 30 seconds.


The best temperature will be between 185 and 195 degrees Fahrenheit (85 and 91 degrees Celsius).Water within this range should be hot enough to heat the grounds and release their flavor without burning them.

, Pour the hot water through the filter screen, adding just enough to fill roughly one-quarter of the chamber. Check the water level after 20 seconds.


A longer dripping time will result in stronger coffee. Ideally, there should only be a few drops per second.
If the entire amount of water dripped through the filter during that time, you will need to decrease the dripping speed.
On the other hand, if nearly no water passed through during that time, you will need to increase the dripping speed.

, Alter the dripping speed by either loosening or tightening the upper screen.


If the coffee drips too fast, decrease the speed by tightening the filter screen another full clockwise turn.
If the coffee drips too slow, increase the speed by loosening the screen one full counterclockwise turn.
You may need to loosen or tighten the screen with an actual screwdriver or similar tool if it won't budge when you use your hands.

, Pour the remaining hot water through the filter screen. Continue until you either use the remaining water or fill the entire chamber.


After filling the chamber, place the lid on top of the device. Doing so will help retain more of the heat, making it an especially important element if you are brewing hot coffee.

, After 4 to 5 minutes, coffee should stop dripping out from the bottom of the filter. When this happens, you should be able to remove the filter device.Periodically check the status of the coffee during this time. You can continue to adjust the speed if doing so is necessary.
If you used a clear glass, look at the side of the glass. You should be able to see two distinct layers: the condensed milk and the brewed coffee.

, Combine the condensed milk and coffee by vigorously stirring the drink with a spoon. The two layers will not combine without being stirred.Technically, this step is only optional. You can drink the two parts separately for an entirely different culinary experience. The condensed milk will not be able to sweeten the coffee, but coffee will gradually flavor the condensed milk as it sits.

, Drink your mug of Vietnamese coffee immediately to prevent it from cooling down any further.


If the coffee is too cold for your liking, you can gently reheat it by resting the bottom of the mug in a shallow saucer of steaming hot water. Stir the coffee as it sits to help distribute the heat throughout the drink.

, Use a spoon to vigorously stir the coffee and condensed milk layers together. The layers will not combine until you mix them manually.


If you would prefer to sweeten your coffee with extra condensed milk or sugar, do so now, making small adjustments to the taste as you stir the drink together.

, Carefully drop the ice cubes into your glass. Allow the beverage to chill for 30 to 60 seconds, or until the temperature drops to your desired range.


Alternatively, you can pour the mixed coffee into a second glass previously filled with ice.Keeping this glass in your refrigerator before using it can help chill the coffee quicker.

, Once the coffee cools down, it should be ready to drink.


Don't worry about the ice diluting the taste. Since iced coffee brews in a stronger, more concentrated form, the ice actually helps mellow the flavor as it melts. This means that as long as the drink remains cool, it should still taste great.

However, there are several ways to get delicious iced coffee without waiting 12 hours for a cold brew.;
, The simplest way to get great tasting, refreshing cold coffee is to brew it twice as strong and let the ice dilute the coffee. Simply brew your coffee like normal, using twice as many grounds (or half as much water) as you normally would. Let the coffee cool for 2-3 minutes before pouring it over a full glass of ice.You may need to add more ice to the drink to keep it cool, as some of it will melt quickly.

, These marvelous little cubes will keep your coffee cold without diluting it. You should consider getting a new ice tray, or dedicating one to coffee cubes, as it will leave a faint coffee flavor in the tray.Brew a fresh pot of regular strength coffee.
Let it cool to room temperature.
Pour the coffee into an ice tray and freeze overnight.
Use the coffee cubes to chill your hot coffee.

, The simplest, easiest way to get cold coffee is to take a fresh pot of coffee, pour some in a mug, and place the mug in the refrigerator. Make sure the top is covered to prevent the coffee from picking up other smells in the fridge and ruining the taste. While this is may not get your coffee cold enough to call ""iced,"" you can add some coffee ice cubes to help make your drink refreshingly chill.

, Sugar dissolves best in hot liquids, so add it before chilling your drink to get the best results. You can add milk or cream at any time, but it is usually best to add it right before serving.

Chill the coffee in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours, or overnight.,
Place a coffee filter in a mesh strainer and rest it over a medium bowl.,
Slowly pour your cold-brew through the strainer.,
Alternatively, make cold brew in a French Press instead of a pitcher.",How to Make Refreshing Cold Coffee2," When you make cold-brew, you avoid diluting your coffee with ice cubes or letting hot coffee sit out and get cold, which ruins its flavor.Cold brewed coffee has less acidity than traditionally made coffee, and less bitterness., Stir them until there are no lumps left in the coffee. You should aim for roughly 4.5 times more water than coffee, so if you want 8 cups of coffee, use 8 cups water and 1.5 cups of grounds.If you grind your own coffee, grind it as finely as you can. This is best for cold-brew., The sugar will dissolve better in warm water and will stay in the drink as it chills. If you try to add sugar to cold coffee the chances are good that you will be left with undissolved sugar at the bottom of your cup.

, If the pitcher has a top, you can also use that instead.

, This is when the coffee actually brews. Because there is no heat involved, it takes much longer to brew than a normal cup off coffee, but the taste is worth it.

, A combination of a filter and mesh strainer should get rid of most grounds in your coffee. Set up the strainer above a bowl, or another pitcher, to catch the coffee.

, The coffee will slowly trickle out the bottom of the strainer and the grounds will remain on top. Pour slowly, and never try to force or press the coffee through the filter. When you are done, throw out the coffee grounds and serve., Simply mix the water and coffee grounds in the pot and put the lid on. Do not push down the plunger. Refrigerate the coffee overnight, then push down the plunger and serve in the morning."

Consider adding:


Chocolate syrup or cocoa powder.
Caramel syrup.

Crushed cookiesCondensed or chocolate milk.
Kahlua, brandy, or Irish Cream.

, You can add them before chilling your pot of cold-brew or right before serving. Spiced coffee goes well with 1/2 cup condensed or regular milk as well. Some suggestions include:


1-2 teaspoons of orange zest with 2-3 crushed pods of cardamon.1 teaspoon of cinnamon, ground cloves, and nutmeg.1 tablespoon honey and 5-10 crushed, chopped mint leaves.

, Boil the water first, then add it to the instant coffee-sugar mixture. Keep stirring until the sugar and instant coffee dissolve. Don't worry if your coffee looks strong. It will become less strong once you add the ice in.


Use less water for a stronger coffee, and more water for a weaker coffee. Keep in mind that the coffee will become even weaker once you add the ice.

, Don't worry if the ice melts; it most certainly will from the hot coffee. These first few ice cubes will dilute the strong coffee mixture and help cool it down initially.

, You can add as many or as few cubes as you'd like. This ice is what will make your coffee nice, cold, and icy.


For a lightly-iced coffee, plop in a few cubes. For a regular iced coffee, fill the glass almost to the top. The ice will melt quickly at first, but it will slow down once the coffee becomes cold.

, If you'll like a lighter iced coffee, you can also add some cold water. Give the coffee a final stir to mix in the creamer.

, The longer you wait, the more watery your iced coffee will become.

Buy no more than two weeks’ worth of coffee at once, so it doesn’t go stale in your pantry.A vacuum-sealed, opaque bag keeps coffee fresher than other packaging.;
, If you’re not a full-fledged coffee fanatic yet, start with a medium roast for coffee, or a dark roast if you’re making espresso.To explore more flavors, experiment with roasts ranging from mild light roasts to the darkest, charred beans. There are actually many degrees of roast that fit into “medium” and “dark,” so try several, comparing the color of the beans.While extra-dark roasts have become “sophisticated,” many coffee lovers prefer a medium or medium dark roast that doesn’t scorch away the unique flavors of the bean.If you’re serious about finding your perfect cup, learn to roast your own beans. Once you’ve had some practice, you can make the freshest coffee possible with perfect control over the roast strength.

, Make sure your coffee manufacturer has nothing to hide. The label should state the type of bean (arabica or robusta) and the country of origin. A blend sourced from multiple countries may mean the manufacturer is choosing cost over quality, but there are certainly high-quality exceptions. The real danger sign is a label that doesn’t provide this information at all.In your quest for perfect beans, choose 100% arabica beans, or a blend with a small proportion of robusta if you enjoy more caffeine. Not all arabica beans are top notch, especially if sold as a dark roast, but the best examples are much tastier and less bitter than robusta., Exposure to air, light, heat, or moisture can ruin the flavor of your coffee beans. Kitchen supply stores sell a great solution: ceramic containers with a latch lid, lined with a rubber band. Sealed plastic tubs or zip-locked bags are okay, but not as airtight.Temperature changes cause flavorful liquids to condense and evaporate. Keep beans at room temperature, or in the fridge if your kitchen is hot. Freeze only if you have too many beans to use in the next few weeks., Coffee grounds will lose flavor the longer you delay. For best results, grind at home using a burr grinder. If you only have a blade grinder, test out the more precise burr method by having your beans ground at a coffee store (not a grocery store), and using them right away. The size of the grind depends on the brewing process:For a French press or cold brew coffee, make a coarse grind, with chunky particles similar to potting soil.
For drip coffee, make a medium grind, the texture of coarse sand.
For espresso, make a fine grind, the texture of sugar or salt.
If your coffee tastes too bitter, try a coarser grind.
If your coffee tastes flat, try a finer grind.

, Many experts favor this method, but it can take some practice to avoid bitter over-extraction.Here's how to make coffee magic:Remove the lid and plunger.
Add the coffee. Use two tablespoons (30 mL) for a one-serving press, or fill to the mark on the side of the press.
Pour hot water to the halfway mark, wetting all the grounds.
After one minute, stir the floating grounds gently. Add the remaining water and put on the lid, with the plunger pulled fully up.
After three additional minutes, press slowly down until the plunger hits bottom. Keep the plunger flat.
Pour into a cup. There will be a little sediment in the bottom, which you can swirl in, save for a strong finish, or leave in the cup.

, Another excellent method, if you can put in a few minutes of effort. Start by rinsing your paper filter and the filter cone in hot water. Place over your cup and brew as follows:Pour coffee grounds into the filter. Shake gently to make it level. Measure according to preference, or about 2 tbsp (30 mL) per serving.
Using a kettle with a narrow spout, add just enough hot water to wet the grounds. Start at the center and work outward, without hitting the filter sides.
Wait 30–45 seconds for the coffee to let off gas, ""blooming.""
Pour the rest of the water from just above the filter cone, evenly across the grounds. Pour at a steady rate and aim to run out of water in about 2 minutes 30 seconds.
Wait for the rest of the water to drip through, about 20–60 seconds.

, There's nothing to this method. Put the water where the water goes and the grounds in the filter, and you'll get coffee. The results are fine, but usually inferior to the methods above.

, Percolators use very hot water that creates a bold cup of slightly burned coffee.Most coffee experts agree that this is the worst brewing method. Single serving coffee containers make all the decisions for you, which usually means a consistently mediocre cup.These options are no good if you're aiming for the skies.

, Stales coffee residue or worse contaminants need to be scrubbed away frequently. If you’re using a machine, refer to the owner’s manual for cleaning instructions.

, You may use cold tap water, if you let it run for a few seconds first. If your tap water has a strong or unpleasant taste, put it through a filter first.Do not use distilled or softened water. These lack minerals which aid the coffee extraction process.Scrub any container used to store water thoroughly and often.

, For more accuracy, use a scale to measure the coffee, not a measuring spoon. While you’re learning, write down the amounts you used and what you thought of the result. You can start with the following recommendations per cup, but feel free to override them with your personal preferences:Coffee grounds: 0.38 ounces (10.6 grams), or 2 tablespoons (30 mL)
Water: 6 fluid ounces (¾ cup / 180 mL). Brewing methods that evaporate a lot of water may require more. It’s best to brew on the strong side, and add more hot water to your cup if it’s too strong.

, Always brew coffee with water temperature between 195 and 205ºF (90.6–96.1ºC).In most home setups, water will cool to this temperature within 10–15 seconds of boiling.Optionally, use an infrared kitchen thermometer to be certain.


At 4,000 feet (1200 meters) above sea level or higher, use the water as soon as it boils.

, Suggested brewing times are included for each brewing method above. Time your brew with a stopwatch for best results. You need just enough time to extract flavor compounds, without over-extracting your way to an extra-bitter cup.


You can reduce the brewing time if using a finer grind, increase it if using a coarser one, or change it to match personal preference.Just keep track of what you’re doing, so you know how to repeat your success.

Brew a cup of coffee.,
Let the coffee cool down a little.,
Fill a tall glass with ice.,
Pour the cooled coffee over the ice.,
Add the cream and sugar to taste.,
Enjoy the coffee before the ice melts.",How to Make Simple Iced Coffee2," If you have not already, get out your coffee maker, and brew a cup of coffee. Try to make it on the stronger side, as the ice will water it down later on.


Consider adding the sugar now. Sugar dissolves better in hot drinks than it does in cold drinks.

, If you just add ice to it, it will not be cold enough. You'll need to let the coffee cool down a little. Room temperature will be enough. If you'd like your iced coffee even colder, wait 15 to 20 minutes, then place it into the fridge for a little bit.


Don't stick your hot coffee straight into the fridge. You'll risk the cup breaking. The hot steam will also raise the temperature of your fridge.

, You can use regular ice cubes, or ice cubes made from frozen coffee. Avoid filling the glass all the way with ice, or you may not have enough room for the coffee. You can always add more ice later, if it is not enough for you.

, If you need to add more ice, do so now.

, If you have not already, add the sugar to your drink now. Start with a splash of cream and a spoonful of sugar, stir, and taste. Add more cream and/or sugar until you get your coffee to where you like it.

, The longer you let it sit, the more watery it will become.

Enjoy your coffee before the ice melts.",How to Make Simple Iced Coffee3," Stir the coffee until there are no more lumps or clumps. You can use a spoon, fork, or whisk. Many people find that iced coffee brewed this way has a bitter taste to it.

, This is what makes the coffee ""cold brewed."" Instead of brewing quickly in hot water, the coffee brews slowly in cold water. Cold brewed coffee is usually less acidic than hot brewed coffee.


Avoid leaving the coffee in the fridge overnight, or it will taste bitter., Make sure that you have enough room for the coffee. You can always add more ice later, if it is not enough for you.

, The filter-lined strainer will catch the coffee grounds when you pour the coffee.

, Squeeze and press the coffee grounds against the filter-lined strainer using the back of a spoon or spatula. This will help get the excess coffee out of the grounds.When you are done, throw the grounds away, or use them to fertilize your garden.

, Start with a splash of milk (or creamer) and a spoonful of sugar. Give it a stir, and taste it. If you need to add more milk or sugar, do so now.


Make sure that you stir well to help the sugar dissolve.

, As the ice melts, your coffee will become more watery and diluted.

Refer to the pairings in the same way as for pairing wine and cheese.Unlike wine, however, you don't have to account for acid levels (as found in wine) or make any attempt to match by region (tea and cheese do not usually arise from the same regions, again unlike wine).For example, expect the tannins in the tea to balance out any rich or sweet elements of the cheese; while a sweet tea can be balanced by a salty cheese.,
Treat the warmth of the tea as a distinct tasting benefit.,
Be aware of the tannin levels in the tea.,
Set up at least three to five types of cheese and paired teas to make the tasting worthwhile.Variety is especially important if you're holding a party.,
Pair cheese according to your wine and cheese favorites.,
Pair salty cheese with sweet teas or floral teas.,
Pair soft or semi-firm and creamy cheese with milder fresh black tea or soft green teas.,
Pair black tea with most types of cheese, if in doubt.,
Pair strongly flavored (hard and soft) cheeses with stronger, high tannin teas.,
Be adventurous.,
Choose three to five types of cheese.,
Choose a range of tea types to pair with the cheeses.,
Display the cheese slices on plain plates and use plain teacups for the tea.",How to Pair Tea and Cheese,";
, Warm tea coupled with the high fat content of many types of cheese can create a creamy and delectable tasting experience., As with wine, tea contains tannins and it is these that are pairing so nicely with the cheese. Tannins produce an astringent, tart taste and also provides color to the tea, so you can picture how much tannin is in a tea by its color depth––less tannins are found in white and green teas, while oolong tea has a mid-range of tannins and black teas have the most tannins.,


Don't just have tea. Also have slices of bread, some crackers and some fruit slices to round out the flavors and choices.
Fresh water will also be appreciated by those wanted to switch to the next flavors.

, For example, if you like a certain cheese with white wine, it's quite possible that the same cheese will pair well with a green tea, while a cheese you are used to enjoying with a red wine will often match well with a black tea.The same strengths of wine tannins will often transfer across to the strengths of the tea tannins.

, This pairing works well with oolong (such as Tung Ting), Earl Grey or Keemun teas.A lightly salted goat cheese will match well with green tea and sweet teas such as jasmine or rose-scented tea.Earl Grey tea is ideal for really salty teas.If you have a favorite floral-scented tea, pair it with saltier cheese. You'll love the complementarity and you may just find a new flavor match that really works well.

, For example, ideal pairings would include a Darjeeling or a fresh green tea such as Japanese sencha.For example:


Asiago cheese pairs well with grassy green tea such as Kukicha or Sencha.Match Brie with a first flush Darjeeling.Match Danish cream Havarti with Darjeeling.Match ricotta, mascarpone and goat cheese with green teas such as Japanese Sencha or Chinese Dragonwell.Pu-erh teas match well with high-fat cheeses., If you're not really adventurous, stay with black or oolong teas to be assured of a decent pairing, or be slightly adventurous and use green tea., For example, pair Assam, Keemun, Ceylon and Autumnal Darjeeling with full-flavored cheeses, such as aged and vintage cheese.Interestingly, green Dragonwell tea can match well with aged cheese too; at least give it a try.Pair nut-like flavored cheeses with teas containing a decent tannin content. For example, match nutty cheeses with Keemun, Ceylon or Dragonwell green teas.Pair Cheddar with black tea. For example, pair it with Earl Grey tea, with its delightful bergamot undertones.Match Gouda with oolong tea.Pungent cheese with a full-bodied flavor such as Gorgonzola and Stilton cheeses, will match well with Pouchong or Lapsang Souchong teas., Learn to match simply by tasting the cheese or the tea, then thinking about what sorts of matches might work. For example, a smoky tea with a smoky cheese, a grassy tea with a fruity cheese, etc. You can ask for taste tests at both cheese stores and tea stores.

, For example, have at least one cheese from each cheese type (salty, soft and creamy, hard and strong, nutty, etc.). Arrange from the mildest to the strongest cheese flavors.


Cheese pieces should be cut from the rind to the tip to experience the full flavor range of the cheese, not just from one spot.Keep the slices as thin as reasonably possible. This is about tasting, so tasters won't be wanting to get filled up.

, Rillo suggests having two to three black teas, one green and one oolong, to cover the range of flavor matches.Arrange the teas from mildest to the strongest flavors.


Good black tea choices: Darjeeling, Assam, Lapsang Souchong and Yunnan., This isn't ""tea party"" time; it's all about the tasting, not the crockery.

Start boiling some water.,
Add the coffee.,
Add the sugar and spices.,
Pour in the hot water.,
Add some milk or cream.,
Stir your coffee and serve it.",How to Make Instant Coffee1," For this recipe, you will need some very hot, almost-boiling water. You can boil some water by putting water in a kettle and turning on the stove. You can also use a coffee maker, an electric kettle, or even a cup and microwave. Take the water off the stove just before it starts to boil. If you are using a coffee maker or a microwave, then just let the water cool down a little bit before using it., How much coffee you use depends on how big your cup is, how much water you will be using, and your personal preferences. Most instant coffee containers will tell you on the label how much instant coffee you should use to get the best taste. In general, most companies recommend using 1 to 2 teaspoons of instant coffee per 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water., At this point, you can add in some sugar. You will need about 1 teaspoon of sugar per 1 cup (240 milliliters) of coffee. Adding your sugar and spices before the water helps blend everything together better and prevents the spices from floating to the top. Once you have added your sugar and flavorings in, give your base another stir to blend everything together. Here are some ideas on how you can flavor your instant coffee:If you love chocolate, consider adding some cocoa powder or chocolate syrup.
For a more traditional taste, add a few drops of vanilla extract.
Add a dash of ground spices for a unique flavor. Consider using any of the following spices: allspice, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg.
Consider skipping the sugar and spices and use flavored coffee creamer instead. If you choose to do this, fill the rest of the cup with hot water, and then add in the flavored creamer.

, Just before the water starts to boil, take it off the heat source and pour it into the cup. You will need about 1 cup (240 milliliters) of hot water.

, You can use any type of milk or creamer you like, such as whole milk, half-and-half, or even coconut milk. The amount you use depends on your preferences. You can also omit the milk or creamer altogether and drink your instant coffee black.


Consider using some flavored coffee creamer instead. Keep in mind that most flavored coffee creamers are very sweet. If you have already added some sugar to your coffee, a flavored coffee creamer will make it even more sweet.

, Before you can drink your coffee, or serve it for someone else to drink, you will need to stir it using a spoon. This helps blend everything together and dissolve the coffee granules and sugar.

For stronger iced coffee, use 2 teaspoons of instant coffee, and 4 teaspoons of hot water. Stir the instant coffee and hot water in a cup until the coffee granules are completely dissolved. You will end up with a thick, concentrated coffee syrup., At this point, you can also add in some sugar, vanilla extract, or spices. Once you have added everything, stir the coffee base with a spoon to mix it all together. Here are some ideas on how you can flavor your instant coffee:


Add some cocoa powder or chocolate syrup for a sweet, unique taste.
Add a few drops of vanilla extract for a sweet, classic taste.
Give your coffee a unique flavor with a dash of ground spices. Consider using any of the following: allspice, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg.
Consider using some flavored coffee creamer instead of sugar and other flavorings.

, Pour 1 cup (240 milliliters) of cold water over your coffee base. For a creamier iced coffee, use cold milk instead.Stir until everything is combined. You will end up with a cup of cold coffee.


Consider using some flavored coffee creamer. Keep in mind that most flavored coffee creamers have some additional sweeteners in them, so if you already added sugar to your iced coffee, you might end up with something that is too sweet.

, Fill a tall glass with ice cubes, and slowly pour your cold coffee over the ice.

, You can drink your iced coffee straight, or you can add some milk or creamer. You can use whole milk, half-and-half, or even coconut milk. How much milk or creamer you use depends entirely on your preferences. Once you have added your milk or creamer, stir the iced coffee with a spoon until you have a uniform color.

, You can drink it straight from the glass, or you can add a straw to it. Drink the iced coffee while it is still cold and before the ice melts.

, Put the lid on the blender and turn it on. Blend everything until the ice is completely crushed. You want to end up with a thick, smoothie-like consistency.


If the consistency is too thick, add a little bit more milk. If the consistency is too thin, add one ice cube.

, Turn the blender off and take the lid off. Slowly pour the blended coffee into a tall glass. You may have to use a spoon or spatula to get everything up.

, You can make your blended coffee extra fancy by adding some toppings to it, such as whipped cream, chocolate sauce, or shaved pieces of chocolate. Here are some ideas:


For a simple blended coffee, add a swirl of chocolate or caramel sauce on top.
For something fancier, squeeze a whorl of whipped cream on top of the blended coffee.
If you want something super fancy, top the blended coffee with some whipped cream. Then, add a drizzle of chocolate sauce on top. Lastly, sprinkle some bits of shaved chocolate on top of the cream.

, Stick a straw into the iced coffee and serve it immediately, before it melts.

Select coffee that’s advertised as low-acid.,
Opt for a dark roast coffee.,
Use coarsely ground coffee.",How to Make Low Acid Coffee1," Some coffee beans undergo processing with steam or solvents to remove some of their acidity. Other coffee beans are naturally low in acid because of the area of the world that they grow in. Start with a coffee that’s designed to be low-acid if you’re concerned about acidity.Coffees that are processed to remove the acidity are often marketed as “mild” or “stomach-friendly.”
Many coffees grown in Hawaii, Sumatra, Brazil, India, and the Caribbean are naturally lower in acid.;
, Dark roast coffees, such as Italian and French roast, are usually lower in acid than light or medium roast varieties. That’s because coffee undergoes chemical changes as it roasts, so the longer that it does, the more acid that is removed. Choose a dark roast coffee and make it using any method that you prefer.Dark roast coffee also causes less acid to be secreted by the stomach than light or medium roasts.
If you’re not used to drinking dark roast, use a smaller amount than you would of your usual light or medium roast until you’re accustomed to the taste.

, If coffee beans are ground too finely, too much of the acid may be extracted during the brewing process. To reduce the acid in your coffee, opt for a coarser grind, which isn’t likely to be over-extracted when you’re brewing your coffee.You may want to try a medium ground coffee to see how it affects your stomach. However, avoid fine and extra fine ground coffees.

Mix the coffee concentrate with hot water.,
Keep the leftover concentrate in the refrigerator.",How to Make Low Acid Coffee2," Take a fine mesh food grade bag, usually used for making nut milk, and place 4 ½ ounces (128 g) of ground coffee in the bag. Cinch or fasten the bag closed so the coffee won’t come out.These types of mesh bags are reusable, so you’ll be able to wash it and use it the next time that you brew coffee.
If you don’t have a mesh bag, you can mix the ground coffee directly into the water in the next step. However, you’ll have to strain the coffee concentrate to remove the grounds after you've refrigerated it. Pour it through a fine mesh sieve before mixing the concentrate with water.

, When the coffee is secure in the mesh bag, place it in the bottom of a 2-quart (1.9 l) pitcher. Add enough cold water to the pitcher to fill it to the brim.For the best tasting coffee, use filtered water.

, Once the coffee is in the pitcher and it’s filled with water, place it in the refrigerator. The coffee will need to brew for at least 12 hours, so it’s a good idea to place it in the fridge the night before you plan to drink the coffee.You may want to experiment with different brew times to see which results in the best tasting coffee. Start with 12 hours, and play around until you’re happy with the flavor.

, After the coffee has brewed for approximately 12 hours, take the pitcher out of the refrigerator. Pull the mesh bag with the coffee out of the water, and squeeze it over the pitcher to extract all of the coffee flavor before discarding the grounds.Make sure to wash the mesh bag thoroughly, so it’s ready for the next time you plan to brew coffee.

, The liquid in the pitcher will be an extremely concentrated form of coffee, so you need to dilute it with water. Mix 1 part of the coffee concentrate with 1 part of hot water for a cup of hot coffee.Coffee that is prepared through cold brewing is 67% less acidic than coffee prepared through hot brewing.
You can also mix the coffee concentrate with cold water and add ice if you prefer iced coffee.

, If you don’t use up all of the coffee concentrate, store it in the fridge. Unlike traditional hot brewed coffee, it won’t go stale so it can keep for up to two weeks."

1/2 cup (4 ounces) milk
1 tablespoon (15 g) cocoa powder
1 tablespoon (15 g) warm water
Sugar (optional)
Whipped cream and cocoa (optional, for topping);
, To be closer to authentic, you'll want to use double-strength, dark-roasted coffee. And you could use instant coffee if you're in a pinch, but brewed coffee is just so much better.


Coffee reaches ""double-strength"" when it's around 4 tablespoons (60 g) of coffee grinds to 6 ounces of water.

, Combine equal parts of each and stir up in a small bowl. You'll need about 2 tablespoons (30 g) for one mocha drink.

, The more coffee you have, the more chocolate syrup you'll probably want. But be sure to leave room for milk!

, How much? Well, how big is your mug? 1/3 to 1/2 cup (3 to 4 ounces) is usually plenty.


You want the milk between 140 and 160°F (60 - 70°C). Any hotter than that and the milk burns, losing its flavor.

, If there's any foam, be sure to hold it back with a spoon, so it layers above the mocha on top.


If you like a really, really sweet mocha, add a teaspoon of sugar to your drink before you top it with foam.

Combine the hot water, cocoa powder, sugar, and salt right in your mug.,
Brew up some espresso.,
Steam 1/2 cup of milk.,
Add the steamed milk to your chocolate syrup.,
Add in your espresso.,
Garnish with whip cream and a sprinkling of cocoa.",How to Make a Mocha Coffee Drink2," Here's what you'll need to make a mocha coffee drink using espresso:


Espresso Roast (regular or decaf)
2 tablespoons (30 g) hot water
1 tablespoon (15 g) unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tablespoon (15 g) sugar
A pinch of salt
1/2 cup milk (any variety)
1 tablespoon flavored syrup (optional)

, This will make the classic chocolate flavoring you can find in your favorite cafe; it will be so much more gratifying than just pouring Hershey's syrup into your coffee. That stuff is for children.

, You want enough to fill just about half of your mug. If you don't want that much caffeine, consider combining it with a decaf roast or using fewer beans in your brew.

, If you have a steamer, of course. If you don't, you can just add your milk straight to your espresso and heat in the microwave or throw the milk onto the stovetop and heat to 160°F (70°C). But if you have an espresso machine, you probably have a steamer!


Make sure the tip of your steamer isn't too near the bottom or too near the top of your milk. You want it not too be too bubbly and aerated, but also not burned and over-steamed. It should only take about 15 seconds, and if you have a thermometer, stop around 160°F (70°C).
Is your mug Central Perk-style large? Then you may want closer to 3/4 of a cup.

, But be sure to hold a large spoon to the edge of your steamed milk to hold back the foam. You want that stuff to go on top, after the milk and chocolate have combined.


Once all the milk has gone into your mug, spoon out the foam so it rests uniformly on top, putting the proverbial icing on the cake.

, Bam! Mocha created. If you have a flavored syrup lying around that you'd like to add (maybe caramel or raspberry), add it at this stage.

, Because it's not enough that it tastes good, it's got to look good too. You can also top it with caramel, cinnamon, or turbinado sugar. Heck, birthday sprinkles and a cherry if you'd like. Now all you have to do is drink up!

The drink contains plentiful antioxidants, and also provides other benefits such as a decreased risk of heart and cardiovascular disease.Keep in mind that green tea has caffeine – although significantly less than coffee. Black teas also are a source of caffeine, but herbal teas typically are caffeine-free.
Yerba mate is another alternative to coffee that is popular in South American. It can provide you with caffeine (about 85 mg per cup compared to 160 mg per cup in coffee, so you won't get jittery) as well as antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals.Because tea has less caffeine than coffee, it will give you the energy jolt you're accustomed to getting from your morning cup of joe, but without the accompanying jitteriness or mental anxiety.
Ginseng tea is a good mental stimulator if you want improved focus and concentration. While the tea typically is bitter, you can sweeten it to taste – just use honey rather than sugar if you want to maintain the drink's healthiness.
Licorice tea is another option. While it is caffeine-free, it still increases energy and boosts adrenal function, so you'll be better equipped to handle stress.;
, Quitting coffee can be even more difficult if you love the taste of the beverage. An herbal tea blend made of chicory root, maca, and roasted dandelion closely approximates coffee's flavor.You typically can find this blend in specialty tea shops, or you can buy the ingredients separately and make it yourself.
This blend doesn't have caffeine, so it may be perfect if you enjoy the taste of coffee but are trying to detox from caffeine.
Chicory often is blended with coffee itself, particularly in northern France and parts of the U.S. with cultures that are significantly French-influenced, such as Louisiana., While lemon water tastes nothing like coffee, the drink is a good morning beverage because it stimulates liver function. Lemon water also wakes up your senses, giving you a jolt of energy.Simply drop a few slices of fresh lemon into your water in the morning. Add a few ice cubes if you want a cold drink.
You might also try a lemon zest or citrus zinger tea, which will both give you a morning pick-me-up and give your immune system a boost.

, Particularly in the afternoon, knock out that sluggish feeling that normally had you running to the nearest coffee shop by drinking a healthy smoothie with a serving of protein-rich nuts such as almonds or cashews.Your afternoon slump typically has more to do with a drop in blood sugar after lunch than it does caffeine. However, you may have been accustomed to beating this decrease in energy with coffee.
A smoothie is a healthier alternative to your afternoon coffee break. Pick fruits and vegetables that are rich in antioxidants and Vitamin C, and add whey powder or blend in almonds to get a protein boost.
Protein provides your body with energy and will help you stay full longer than your typical cup of coffee.

, If a shot of espresso was your favorite way to get your coffee fix, try replacing it with a shot of wheatgrass juice, which is an easily digestible blast of essential vitamins and minerals.

Wheatgrass juice also is a natural way to boost your energy without caffeine.
If you don't like the taste of wheatgrass juice, try mixing it into a smoothie to disguise the taste.

, There are many healthier alternatives to coffee that still have caffeine, although typically in lower amounts than your average cup of joe. If you want to detox from caffeine, you'll want to avoid these beverages.Consider switching to decaf coffee, which gives you the familiar taste of coffee with far less caffeine (about the amount in a cup of tea).
If you have started a medication to control a health condition, or if you are pregnant, your doctor may have advised you to substantially decrease or eliminate caffeine from your diet.
If you plan on detoxing from caffeine as well as kicking your coffee habit, be on the lookout for foods such as chocolate that also contain caffeine.

, Coffee itself contains antioxidants that are beneficial to your overall health. Ideally, if you plan to decrease or eliminate your coffee consumption, you should find another way to get the antioxidants you need.If you want to continue receiving antioxidants but want to stop drinking coffee, start increasing the amount of fruits and vegetables you eat each day.
Green and white tea contain more antioxidants than coffee does, but they also may contain caffeine. Keep that in mind if you plan to eliminate caffeine as well as coffee from your diet.
Fruit and vegetable juicesalso are high in antioxidants. Choose whole, natural juices such as cranberry or pomegranate that aren't watered down and have no added sugar and limit your consumption to 4 oz per day.

, Particularly if you're going to quit caffeine entirely, the most painless way to do so is to mark a specific ""quit"" date on your calendar. Make it at least a few weeks out so you have time to taper off your coffee consumption.Ideally, you want to set your date at least two weeks in advance. The specific amount of time, however, will depend on how much coffee you normally drink and how much of it you want to replace with healthier alternatives.
Try not to set your date more than a month out, or you'll decrease your chances of sticking to it. If it's too far away, it becomes less of an active goal and more of a general idea of something you want to do ""sometime.""
Particularly if you're also planning to detox from caffeine, it may be best to set the date for a weekend or holiday, when you can stay at home and avoid coffee as much as possible during the most difficult first few days.
When you pick your day, mark it on your calendar and post it in several places that you see often. This will reinforce the date in your mind.

, While you can quit coffee cold turkey, taking an incremental approach will decrease your withdrawal symptoms and give you a better chance of quitting successfully.You can do this by gradually decreasing the number of cups of coffee you drink per day. For example, if you normally drink five cups a day, drop that to four. Drink only four cups of coffee a day for a couple of days, then drop down to three. Keep going until you are no longer drinking coffee.
If you enjoy the taste of coffee just as much as caffeine, try gradually switching out your coffee with decaf. The first day, have coffee as you regularly do. For the next few days, only have decaf in the afternoons (if you normally drink regular coffee in the afternoon). Then start replacing your first morning cup with decaf — half-caf the first day, and gradually decreasing the amount of caffeinated coffee thereafter.
Once you've switched to decaf, you've decreased your body's dependency on caffeine. Now you can attack your attachment to the particular flavor of coffee if your goal is to give up coffee altogether.

, Coffee actually has many proven health benefits, and can be a good thing when consumed in moderation. If you are simply drinking too much, consider using the above method to taper down to drinking no more than two or three cups daily and see if that works for you.If you still experience adverse side effects, like jitteriness or muscle tremors, then it may be that coffee just isn't for you. Otherwise, it may not be necessary to eliminate it from your diet completely.

Coffee is packed with antioxidants — in fact, it is one of the top sources of antioxidants for Americans— which protect your cells from cancer-causing free radicals. Studies have shown that drinking five or more cups of coffee a day can decrease your risk of breast cancer by 57 percentand your risk of heart disease by 21 percent.Coffee may also reduce your risk of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, lower your risk of type 2 diabetes, and decrease your risk of cirrhosis of the liver., Coffee probably has become a habitual part of your life in ways you don't even notice. Take some time to reflect on those habits so you can change them gradually. Recognize that it may take some time to completely eliminate your coffee habit.While you're cutting back on your coffee, think of the various rituals that you associate with coffee.
For example, coffee may be a part of your morning routine. Since your first morning cup probably will be the last to go, you have plenty of time to divorce yourself from this ritual. Try doing other things before you make the coffee, or stop presetting your coffee maker so that you awake to the aroma of coffee.
If you and your coworkers have an afternoon ritual of getting coffee at a nearby coffee shop or together in the break room, drink something else instead of coffee. You may want to suggest meeting somewhere else the first few days so you aren't distracted and tempted by the smell of coffee.

, Getting some light exercise first thing in the morning jump-starts your body, giving you a sustainable burst of energy that will help carry you through the rest of your day.Unlike caffeine, the energy produced from a short cardiovascular workout is sustainable, and won't result in a crash later in the afternoon.
If your mornings are particularly frenzied, keep in mind that you don't have to complete a full-blown workout. 10 to 15 minutes of moderate exercise is all you need to get your blood pumping.

, When you stop drinking coffee, your weight may increase or decrease as a result, even if you don't change any other part of your daily routine. Evaluating how you normally drink coffee can give you a better idea of what to expect.For example, if you enjoyed drinking coffee drinks with milk and sugar or flavored syrups, you may actually lose weight because of all the calories your regular coffee drink contained.
However, because caffeine acts as a natural appetite suppressant, you also may gain weight when you quit coffee — particularly if you find yourself snacking more throughout the day as a result.
You can prevent this weight gain by increasing your daily activity and stocking up on healthy snacks such as fruits and vegetables, yogurt, and nuts.

, Especially if you're quitting caffeine entirely, let those around you know when your quit date is. Not only will they be more understanding with you during that time, but they'll have a better idea of what to expect from you.Ask your friends and family to have patience when dealing with you in the first few weeks, when you likely will be suffering from caffeine withdrawal.
If you have friends that you often meet over coffee, find out if they would be willing to meet you for other activities, such as a walk in the park or a trip to a smoothie shop.
Keep in mind that having people around you who love you and support your effort can make it much easier to reach your goals. You may even be able to get another friend with similar concerns to quit coffee with you, so you can bond in solidarity.

, Particularly if you enjoy frequenting coffee shops, replacing coffee with healthier alternatives may mean you have to come up with other social options as well.For example, if one of your favorite coffee shops frequently has shows by local musicians that you enjoy, talk to those musicians and find out some other places they play where you can enjoy the music without being tempted by the sight and smell of coffee.
Outdoor activities are a good way to get a little exercise while avoiding the temptation of coffee. Get friends to meet you at a local park, join a community sports team, or get involved in local events.

, Many workplaces don't give you the freedom to take a short nap during the workday. However, if you have the opportunity to do it, a power nap can refresh and re-energize your body just as well — if not better — than an afternoon cup of coffee.If you're taking a power nap, set an alarm and make sure you wake up within 15 or 20 minutes. Napping for any longer than that can leave you more tired.
Even if you find it difficult to nap, taking a few minutes in the afternoon to sit in quiet meditation also is a good way to recharge your batteries.

, Headaches and an upset stomach are a natural part of the withdrawal process. Even if you're not quitting caffeine entirely, you still may have some of these symptoms as a result of decreased caffeine intake.Keep in mind that the quickest way to eliminate the symptoms of caffeine withdrawal is to consume a little caffeine; however, if you're trying to address your body's dependence on caffeine, this won't help your cause and will only set you back further.
Check ingredient labels in over-the-counter remedies carefully, and make sure whatever you're taking doesn't include caffeine. For example, many over-the-counter headache medications, particularly those for migraines, may include caffeine as an ingredient.
If you're currently on medication to treat a particular medical condition, talk to your doctor before using over-the-counter remedies, as they may interfere with the effectiveness of your prescription drugs.

Choose from hundreds of types of green, black, white, red, and herbal teas, each with a different flavor profile. You can buy loose tea or purchase it prepackaged in bags. Choose the freshest tea you can find for best flavor and health benefits.


Choose tea with the properties you're looking for. Note that green tea is known for its long-term health benefits,black tea provides a small jolt of caffeine, and herbal teas may be used to remedy everything from sleeplessness to poor digestion.;
, If your tea is pre-bagged, your filtration system is already set. If you have loose tea, however, you'll need a way to remove it from the water after steeping.


You can buy your own empty teabags and fill them with tea for one-time use.
Tea balls are another popular choice. These are better to use for black tea than other types of tea that tend to expand more during the brewing process. In order to brew a great cup of tea, the water needs to be able to flow freely through the leaves.
Basket filters are a good choice for any type of tea.
You can pour water directly over loose tea and filter it out after it steeps using a fine-mesh strainer.

, What type of tea equipment do you have? You can make a whole pot of tea using a teapot, or do a cup at a time using a teacup and strainer, tea ball or tea bag. Use the method that's most convenient for your needs. The tea and water are the two most important components of a good cup of tea; the equipment is secondary.


That said, having a nice tea kettle and pretty cups can add to the calming effect of drinking and enjoying tea. Drinking tea has been an important ritual in many cultures for thousands of years. You can keep this tradition alive by creating your own tea-drinking ritual, whether it's brewing a cup at a time in your favorite mug, or using a pretty ceramic teapot with cups and saucers.
The material of the accessories are important as well. Heavy metals are better for teas that need to be prepared at high temperatures due to their ability to retain heat, while less conductive materials are recommended for teas with a colder preparation. Use glass for white, green, and herbal tea; porcelain for white, black, and herbal tea; and yixing for oolong and pu-erh.

, Since tap water contains fluoride and other chemicals, using it to brew tea can negatively impact the flavor. While tap water is always fine in a pinch, if you want the best possible flavor and health benefits, use spring water or another type of filtered, pure water.

, If your tea comes in bags, you're all set. For loose tea, you'll need approximately 1 teaspoon per 6 ounce serving of water. Use a teaspoon to measure out the correct amount into your tea bag, tea ball or basket filter. Place it inside the cup, mug or teapot you're using.


Note that a 6-ounce serving is standard teacup size. If you're making enough tea for a large mug, you might want to use a little more.
If you're making a heavier, denser tea, such as many types of black tea, you can use a little less than a teaspoon per serving. For lighter, bulkier teas, like green teas and herbal teas, use a little more than a teaspoon. After the first few cups you make, you can start measuring out your tea to taste.

, Measure out a bit more than you need for the tea based on your preferred serving size and boil it. No matter what kind of tea you're brewing, you'll need to bring the water to a full, rolling boil as a first step. You can do this quickly using a tea kettle, but it works just as well to fill a small saucepan with water and heat it up on the stove over high heat. You can also use a microwave to heat your water in a microwave-safe dish.

, Pour some of the boiling water into the empty teapot and swish it around. Let the entire pot get warm to touch. Discard this water and immediately place the correct amount of tea in pot. Immediately placing the tea into the pot can cause the pot to crack, and preheating it prevents this., If you're making black tea, go ahead and pour the boiling water directly over the tea to begin the steeping process. For green, white or herbal tea, take it off the heat and wait 30 seconds until the boil stops, then pour it over the tea. This prevents the delicate leaves from overcooking, which would result in a bitter taste. If you want to make it an exact science, use a thermometer to take the water's temperature so you can control the flavor of the tea.



Black tea is best steeped at a temperature of 203 degrees Fahrenheit (95 degrees Celsius).

Green tea is best steeped at a temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (74 to 85 degrees Celsius) before you pour it over the tea.

White tea should be steeped at a temperature of 185 degrees Fahrenheit (85 degrees Celsius).

Oolong tea is best steeped using a temperature of 203 degrees Fahrenheit (95 degrees Celsius).

Herbal teas should be steeped using a temperature of 203 degrees Fahrenheit (95 degrees Celsius).

, The amount of time you'll steep the tea depends on both the type of tea you're making and your individual taste. Experiment to find the steeping time that is best for your cup of tea.



Black tea should be steeped for 3 to 5 minutes.

Green tea should be steeped for 2 to 3 minutes.

White tea should be steeped for for 2 to 3 minutes.

Oolong tea should be steeped for for 2 to 3 minutes.

Herbal teas should be steeped for 4 to 6 minutes.

, After the steeping time is up, remove the tea leaves. Your tea should be cool enough to drink. Enjoy it plain or with honey, milk or sugar.

, Iced tea is made by making very concentrated tea, then adding water and ice to chill it. To make it, you'll need to double the amount of tea leaves per serving. Iced tea is a wonderful refreshment on a hot day, and can be made with any type of tea. Herbal teas and fruit teas taste particularly delicious iced.

, This is a fun way to make tea using the natural heat from the sun's rays. You set out a container of water and tea in the bright sun for several hours, allowing it to slowly steep. Once the tea is strong enough, you can remove the tea bags and ice the tea.

, You'll find this variation in every Southern restaurant. Black tea is brewed strong, then sweetened with plenty of honey and lemon and poured over ice.

, If you have a sore throat, combining the healing powers of tea with the warming effect of whiskey can help soothe the inflammation. Brew a perfectly steeped cup of your favorite tea, then add a shot of whiskey. Sweeten it with honey and sip slowly.

Consider a simple syrup for sweetening your coffee.,
Add equal parts white sugar and water to a saucepan.,
Pour the syrup into a squeeze bottle for easy use and storage.,
Flavor your syrup if desired.",How to Sweeten Your Coffee1," Simple syrup - a mixture of sugar and water - is the favored sweetener at many specialty coffee shops. Because it is liquid, it mixes effortlessly into your coffee, which is especially helpful for iced preparations. Simple syrup is also preferable for sweetening high-quality coffees, as it lends no additional flavor to mask the coffee's own nuanced flavor profile.;
, Heat and stir until the sugar has all dissolved. The resulting mixture is simple syrup, and should be slightly more viscous than water.

, To keep the simple syrup for continued use, pour it into a squeeze bottle or other similar container. It can kept at room temperature almost indefinitely.

, You can flavor simple syrups using vanilla bean, cinnamon, citrus rinds, and other herbs and spices. Add the flavoring agent to the heated syrup, and allow it to steep for several minutes while the mixture cools down.

Sweeten your coffee with honey.,
Add agave nectar to your coffee.,
Add molasses to your coffee for a rich taste.,
Use stevia for a sugar-free option.",How to Sweeten Your Coffee2," Honey is a naturally produced product that is very shelf stable. It will also add its own subtle flavor to your coffee. You can experiment with different types of honey to determine which flavor best suits the type of coffee you drink.

, Agave nectar is a natural sweetener that is absorbed very slowly by your body, unlike white sugar. It can be used in place of sugar in many recipes, but is also well suited for mixing into your coffee. You can purchase agave nectar at health food stores and many grocery stores.

, Molasses is a by-product of the sugar refining process, and has a thick, dark appearance. It is absorbed more slowly in the body than sugar. Sweetening your coffee with molasses will provide a rich, earthy flavor without adding as many calories as white sugar.

, Stevia is a plant that has a naturally sweet flavor while providing a very low level of carbohydrates. This is a great way to sweeten coffee without adding any calories, and is a more natural alternative to artificial sweeteners like aspartame and Sucralose.

Avoid grinding your coffee in advance if possible.,
Choose an opaque container for storing coffee.,
Store your coffee in an airtight container.,
Keep your coffee beans or ground coffee in a relatively dry environment.,
Avoid storing coffee beans or grounds in extreme temperatures.",How to Store Coffee Beans or Ground Coffee," As soon as coffee is ground, its surface area is vastly increased and it begins deteriorating very quickly. Pre-ground coffee therefore tastes and smells much staler and less vibrant than coffee ground freshly before brewing. If you are interested in storing your coffee to achieve optimal flavor, the most important step you can take is to invest in a coffee grinder so that you can grind coffee beans just before brewing.;
, Light is perhaps the primarily culprit for causing coffee beans or grounds to go stale quickly. This problem is easily remedied by storing coffee in an opaque container rather than a clear glass or plastic vessel. If you insist on storing your coffee in a transparent container, it is best to store the container away from light, for example in a pantry or cabinet.

, A second enemy of fresh-tasting coffee is oxygen. Exposure to the air causes coffee beans, or especially ground coffee, to go stale very quickly. Invest in a hermetically sealed container for storing coffee, or at least use a container with a very heavy lid. Airtight containers are also ideal for preventing coffee from absorbing neighboring odors and discouraging insect and mold growth.

, You may not have a great degree of control over the moisture level in your kitchen pantry or cabinets, but note that coffee will keep best in a dry environment. For example, avoid storing coffee beans in a damp basement.

, Like many bulk food items, coffee does not keep well in extremely cold or hot temperatures. Avoid storing coffee in rooms that are not heated in winter or that are not cooled during summer.

Start with cream and sugar.,
Try a latte.,
Try iced drinks.,
Have a frozen drink.",How to Start Drinking Coffee2," One of the first ways most people drink their coffee is with cream and sugar. The amount of each varies from person to person. Add a packet or tablespoon of sugar and the cream of your choice.


A popular cream for coffee is half and half. You could also use regular milk, almond milk or soy milk. Avoid powdered coffee creamers, as they can clump when you add them to coffee.You can also swirl a cinnamon stick in your coffee. This will help reduce the bitterness and make the coffee taste sweeter.Adjust the proportions to your liking.

, Lattes are traditionally an espresso drink with milk. This is a popular drink because of its mellow and sweet flavors. A latte consists of one or two shots of espresso mixed with six to eight ounces of steamed milk.In South American countries a popular variation of this is called Cafe con Leche (coffee with milk). This is also recommended since it's coffee, milk, and sugar steamed together. The outcome is a frothy and delicious beverage.

, Some people are simply not fans of hot drinks. If you want to try a normal cup of cold coffee, order an iced coffee or cold press. Add cream and simple syrup to your liking. Almost anything you order at a coffee shop can be put over ice. Many coffee enthusiasts discourage this because it takes away from the flavor. Do what you have to do!


Ask a barista for a recommendation if you’re curious about trying a drink over ice.

, Coffee, like all other types of drinks and drink combinations, can be served frozen. There are different types of frozen coffee drinks like Starbucks’ Frappuccino. This will appeal especially to the lovers of coffee flavored ice cream. This style is served sweet, with whipped cream on top, and sometimes a flavour of your choice infused into the beverage.There are plenty of variations that smaller coffee shops have made to the Frappuccino.

Purchase different types of coffees.,
Decide how you’ll brew it.,
Compare your coffees.,
Drink coffee when you want to.",How to Start Drinking Coffee3," If you have access to a local coffee roasting company, ask them about popular blends. Be open and honest that you want to start drinking coffee but are new to the experience. Explain what you’ve tried and what you like/dislike and ask for advice.If you don’t have access to a coffee roaster, try striking up a conversation about coffee with either a barista at a coffee shop or someone working in a grocery store.

, There are plenty of different ways to brew coffee. One of the best ways for you to create a batch is by using a french press or a pour over. These types of coffee makers do not let the coffee sit on top of a burner for a long period of time, so they preserve the flavors and don't burn the coffee.Buy a small french press for sampling different brews. These coffee makers will create a little over an eight ounce cup of coffee.

, Now that you understand how you like to drink your coffee, prepare multiple cups of different blends of coffee. Allow them to cool before sampling. Have a neutral food like bread around to cleanse your palate between tasting.


Don’t focus on labels or names while tasting. Try to make your tasting as unbiased as possible., Again, try not to develop a dependence for coffee. View coffee as a specialty drink instead of a necessity for starting your day. Continue developing your taste buds and experiment with different ways to prepare coffee.


Find your own path! Coffee appreciation can be a complex road. Stick to your heart and avoid a trend if you disagree.

Put a dash of salt in the coffee.,
Add cream or milk to the coffee.,
Put sugar in the coffee.",How to Reduce Bitterness in Coffee1," Adding a dash of salt to your coffee can help to suppress the bitterness in the coffee and enhance the coffee’s flavor. This is because sodium chloride, or table salt, makes the sodium in coffee more distinct, resulting in coffee that tastes less bitter. You can add a dash of salt to freshly brewed coffee to cut down on the bitterness.You can use common table salt for this method.
Keep in mind that adding a small amount of salt to your coffee will not make it taste more salty or ruin the underlying flavors in the coffee.;
, Another easy option is to add cream or milk to your coffee to cut down on the bitterness. This may be a good option if you tend to drink your coffee with cream or milk and want to have a more neutral taste. The fat content in cream and milk can counteract the bitterness in the coffee.If you tend to drink your coffee black, but want to try this method, you can try adding a spoonful of cream or milk and taste the coffee to see if it is to your liking. You may then add more cream or milk if the coffee is still too bitter.

, If you don’t mind counteracting bitterness with sweetness, adding sugar to your coffee may be the way to go. Put a teaspoon of sugar in your coffee to cut down on the bitterness and give your coffee a sweeter taste.You can use white sugar or brown sugar for this method. Cane sugar tends to have less additives so it may be the better option.

Fill the machine with water.,
Insert the filter.,
Measure out your coffee.,
Prepare your machine.,
Brew the coffee.,
Clean up.",How to Prepare Filter Coffee1," Most coffee makers will have a water reservoir which you'll need to fill before brewing. Only pour in as much water as you'd like to brew, since the machine will continue to brew until the reservoir is empty.


Always use clean filtered water for the best taste. Filtered water can also prevent mineral deposits from building up on the machine's tubing.;
, Use the filter that comes with the machine. Your machine may have a flat-bottomed plastic reservoir for you to put a paper filter in. Or, your machine may have a reusable metal mesh filter that is shaped like a cone.


If you use a paper filter, be sure to use one that's large enough to fit your pot.
If you use a reusable filter, take care to clean it in between brewing., Use medium to medium-fine ground coffee that you've preferably ground yourself. Grinding the beans immediately before brewing will give your coffee more flavor. Use 1 heaping tablespoon of grounds for every 5 ounces of water. Place the grounds in the filter. You can always adjust this ratio, using more or less coffee or water to get your desired coffee strength.Store unused ground coffee in an airtight container away from light, heat, and moisture. Try to use it within a week., Your coffee maker should be clean and ready to go. Make sure the machine is plugged in and the empty carafe is on the burner plate. Some coffee makers have an automatic start feature which you can set at this point. If you do, you can program the machine to start brewing coffee at a certain point during the day, so long as it's prepared.


At this point, water and coffee grounds should already be in the machine.

, Turn on your coffee maker. For many simple coffee makers, this just means pressing a single button. But, some coffee makers allow you to customize how much water you'd like to brew, how strong you want your coffee, or how long you'd like to brew it. Read your machine's owner's manual to learn about it's brewing capabilities.


Avoid leaving the carafe or pot on the burner while the machine is on for a long time after your coffee has brewed into it. This can continue to cook the coffee, giving it a burnt taste., Don't leave old coffee to sit in the pot or leave grounds in the filter. If left long enough, they'll mold and make the coffee machine smell. Instead, toss or compost your used coffee grounds. Wash out the coffee pot or carafe and don't forget to rinse out the filter or filter holder.


Follow the manufacturer's instructions for deep cleaning the machine on a regular basis. This usually involves alternating brew cycles of hot water and vinegar which can prevent mineral buildup in the machine."

Reduce your risk of depression.",How to Start Drinking Coffee4," The American Heart Association conducted an extensive study among coffee drinkers and non-coffee drinkers. What they found was that those who consumed 1-5 cups of coffee a day were associated with a lower risk of mortality. They even deducted that both caffeinated coffee and decaf were alike in lowering your mortality., Another study by the American Heart Association found that that 1-2 cups of coffee a day decrease your likelihood for having a stroke. The study found that coffee consumption also decreases your risk for other forms of cardiovascular disease., Another study found that caffeine and coffee intake reduces your chances of getting type 2 diabetes. This does not apply to the coffee drinkers who add sugar or drink forms of sweetened coffee., This study used a large group women free of any depressive symptoms and tracked their coffee consumption. The results found that the women who drink a cup or less of coffee ran a higher risk of getting depression. Those who drank three to five cups were found to have less of a risk for depression.This study was only tested on women and may have different results for men.

Go for drip coffee.,
Adjust the grind size of the coffee.,
Check that the water you use is not too hot.,
Keep your brewing equipment clean.,
Store leftover coffee in a thermos.",How to Reduce Bitterness in Coffee2," Drip coffee or pour over coffee tends to have less bitterness than other brewing options like french press or espresso brewing. If you are trying to avoid bitter coffee, you may go for drip coffee at home or when you are getting coffee at a coffee shop. Avoid espresso brewing, such as an espresso shot or an Americano style coffee, as these tend to be the most bitter.If you brew your own coffee at home, the bitterness of the coffee will depend on the type of bean you use, the roasting method used on the beans, and the amount of beans you use. You may need to play around with your drip coffee method to find a brew that is not too bitter.

, If you prepare your own coffee at home, you should grind your own beans for the freshest coffee possible. When you do this, make sure you are not grounding the coffee too finely. Brewing methods like french press and drip brewing will require different grind sizes. Often, french press tastes less bitter if the grinds are coarse and not too fine. Drip coffee tends to taste less bitter if the grinds are medium fine rather than very fine.You may need to experiment with the grind size for your coffee depending on what type of brewing method you use. Finding the right grind size may improve the overall taste of your coffee, including the level of bitterness in the coffee.

, Another reason why your home brewed coffee may be bitter tasting is because you are using water that is too hot to brew the coffee. Using water that is too hot to brew the coffee can lead to more bitterness in your cup. You should aim for water temperatures between 195 degrees Fahrenheit (91 degrees Celsius) and 205 degrees Fahrenheit (96 degrees Celsius). Do not let the water boil to beyond 210 degrees Fahrenheit (98 degrees Celsius).It may also be good to get into the habit of letting the water sit for a few minutes in the kettle so it can reduce in temperature before you pour it over your coffee grounds.
Stirring the coffee grinds rapidly with a spoon once you have poured the water over them can also improve the flavor of the coffee.

, Make sure you rinse out all your brewing equipment every time you brew coffee. Residue grounds can end up getting into your next cup, affecting the flavor and perhaps making it too bitter. Use hot water to rinse out the drip coffee equipment as well as the french press equipment so it is clean for the next time you brew coffee at home.You should also let your brewing equipment air dry so it is clean and ready for use the following day.

, If you use the french press brewing method, you should always pour out any leftover coffee in the french press into a thermos to keep it warm. Leaving the coffee in the press will make the coffee more bitter as it will sit longer with the grinds. When you go to pour the leftover coffee in your cup, you may end up with a very bitter cup of coffee.You may also try to avoid having leftover coffee by measuring out the water by cup when you brew the coffee. For example, if you are planning to have two cups of coffee, one for you and a friend, you may measure out enough water for two cups exactly so you do not have to worry about leftover coffee sitting in the press.

"
Go for medium roast coffee.,
Try decaffeinated coffee.,
Avoid instant coffee.",How to Reduce Bitterness in Coffee3," Medium roast coffee tends to have a less bitter flavor than dark roast coffees. This is because medium roast coffees are often roasted for less time and at a lower temperature than dark roast coffees. As a result, medium roast coffee varieties tend to have a higher acid content and a more potent aroma than dark roast coffees, as well as less bitterness.Look for medium roast coffee at your local coffee shop. Or buy medium roast coffee beans and brew your own coffee at home to your liking.

, The decaffeination process of coffee has also been shown to reduce bitterness. You can try having decaf coffee beans to see if they taste less bitter. Go for decaf coffee at your local coffee shop or purchase decaf coffee beans and prepare them at home., Though you may be tempted to save some time and energy by going for instant coffee, keep in mind it can often taste too bland or too bitter. Instant coffee only requires hot water and a few stirs to create a cup of coffee, but it can contain additives, preservatives, and low quality coffee beans. If possible, substitute instant coffee for the real thing. Go for brewed coffee that is not too bitter and enjoy the real taste of coffee in your cup."

Be sure to use clean, filtered water for the best taste.Either use a kettle that has a long thin spout or carefully transfer the water to a pouring kettle with a long thin spout. Take care not to burn yourself when handling boiling water.

, Unfold your Chemex paper filter so that it's shaped like a cone. Set it in the top part of the Chemex. Pour a little hot water over the filter so that it's completely soaked. Carefully, pour out and discard the soaking liquid.


This will help create a seal against the Chemex pot, can get rid of any paper taste from the filter, and preheats your pot, so you don't end up with cold coffee., Ideally, you should weigh your ground coffee so you get an accurate measurement. Weigh out 42 grams or use 6 tablespoons of ground coffee for an 8-cup Chemex. Always use medium-coarse grounds.


If you can, grind your beans just before using them. Fresher beans will make a better tasting pot of coffee. If you need to buy pre-ground coffee, just take care to store it in an air-tight container out of direct sunlight and use it within a week., Place the grounds in the pre-moistened filter that should still be in the top of your Chemex.Set the Chemex on top of a digital scale. You should also have a digital timer or clock ready before you start brewing.


Make sure to zero out the scale once the prepared Chemex is on it. This will help you accurately measure out the water.

, Start the digital timer or look at the clock to keep track of when you start brewing. Slowly pour about 2/3 of a cup or 150 grams of the hot water over the grounds in the filter. Gently stir the grounds with a spoon or chopstick.


Stirring can break up any clumps of coffee grounds and make sure the grounds are completely saturated., Once your grounds are saturated, wait around 45 seconds. Slowly, pour about 2 1/2 cups or 450 grams of water over the grounds. The water should come almost to the top of the Chemex.You should use a circular wiggling motion when pouring the water over the grounds. This can help mix the coffee and water together.

, Wait another 45 seconds. This will give the coffee a chance to brew while slowly filtering into the Chemex. Add more water. Slowly, pour enough to almost completely fill the filter and cover the grounds.Your scale should read close to 700 grams.

, The water will slowly filter through the grounds and the paper, into the bottom of the Chemex. This process should take a few more minutes. You don't need to stir the coffee, just let it filter down.


The entire process should take around 4 minutes, from when you started saturating the grounds to when it's done brewing., After you've brewed your coffee for around 4 minutes and it's reached enough volume, lift up the filter and let it drain a few seconds. Set the filter aside. Swirl the coffee in the bottom of the Chemex and pour it into two mugs.There's a small glass bubble on the side of your Chemex. This indicates a 20 ounce measurement.

Take care not to burn yourself when handling boiling water.

, Unfold your paper filter and place it so that it fits the single cup brewer that you set over your coffee mug. Pour a little hot water over the filter so that it's completely soaked. Carefully, pour out and discard the soaking liquid.There are a variety of single cup cone brewers available. These include Kalita, Bee House, Clever Dripper, and Hario V60. The brewer will sit atop the serving mug so the coffee filters directly down and into your mug.

, Weigh out 24 grams or about 2 tablespoons of ground coffee for your pour over brewer. Always use medium-coarse grounds. Using the right grounds will create the right extraction for the time you're brewing. For example, using a larger surface area (coarse grounds) requires longer brewing time than fine grounds that only need a quick extraction.If you can, grind your beans just before using them. Fresher beans will make a better tasting pot of coffee. If you need to buy pre-ground coffee, just take care to store it in an air-tight container out of direct sunlight and use it within a week.

, Place the grounds in the pre-moistened filter that should still be in the top of your pour over brewer. You should also have a digital timer or clock ready before you start brewing.


You'll use about 400 grams of water which will yield one large cup of coffee., Start the digital timer or look at the clock to keep track of when you start brewing. Slowly pour about 1/4 of a cup or 50 grams of the hot water over the grounds in the filter. Gently stir the grounds and water (known as a slurry) with a spoon or chopstick.


Stirring can break up any clumps of coffee grounds and make sure the grounds are completely saturated., Once your grounds are saturated, wait for 30 seconds. This allows the coffee grounds to bloom. Slowly, pour more water over the grounds so the filter is always half-full of water.You should use a circular wiggling motion when pouring the water over the grounds. This can help mix the coffee and water together.

, The water will slowly filter through the grounds and the paper, into the bottom of the pour over brewer. You don't need to stir the coffee, just let it filter down. Remove the filter and drink your coffee.


This entire process should take a total of 2 1/2 to 3 minutes from the time you started brewing."

Keep percolating time short.",How to Perk Coffee," As with other forms of brewing coffee (like ""drip"" brewing methods), the first thing you'll need to do is decide how much coffee you want to brew, then add this amount of water to the ""tank"" or ""reservoir"" portion of the percolator. Depending on how your percolator is assembled, you may simply be able to open the lid and pour your water in, or you may need to remove the upper ""basket"", which holds the coffee grounds during brewing, to access the reservoir.


Most standard-size percolators will hold about 4 - 8 cups, though differently-sized varieties exist. As a reference point, four cups of coffee equates to roughly two standard-sized mugfuls.;
, Next, if you had to remove the upper basket/chamber or the central tube to add the water, replace them now. Though every percolator is different, the basic construction of most is nearly identical — the coffee grounds should sit above the water in a small basket or chamber lined with small holes. A narrow tube should extend from this basket down into the water below.


When the water heats, it will naturally move us the tube and into the coffee grounds. As it soaks into the grounds, it will pick up some of their aroma and flavor and drain back down into the water below, where the cycle will repeat.

, Next, add your coffee grounds to the upper basket lined with small holes. You can use either fresh-ground coffee or pre-ground beans — which ever you prefer. Use roughly 1 tablespoon (15 ml) for each cup of water you use if you like your coffee strong. For weaker coffee, use 1 teaspoon per cup. As you use your percolator, you may find that you need to adjust these measurements to get your coffee tasting just right.


As we'll discuss below, for most percolator brewing, you'll want to use a light, low-acidity roast and a fairly coarse grind — coarser than what you might use for a standard drip machine.

, You're ready to go — now, all you need to do is heat up the water in the bottom of your percolator and physics will do the rest. Your goal is to heat up your water to the point that it's quite hot, but not boiling. The hotter the water is, the more quickly it will absorb flavor from the beans, which means that boiling water can lead to coffee that's too strong. Use medium heat to get your water just below boiling, then reduce the heat to keep it hot, but not boiling or simmering. If you see steam at any point, your percolator is too hot and you should reduce your heat (or carefully move your percolator to a cooler area).


In terms of heat sources, stove tops offer the most control, but you can also use campfires if you keep a careful eye on your coffee's progress.
Always operate your percolator with medium heat from below — don't use an oven or another all-around heat source or you risk damaging your equipment and ruining your pot of coffee.

, Many percolators contain a glass or see-through globe at the top to allow you to monitor the progress of your coffee as it brews. As the water begins to circulate through the percolator, you'll notice it sputter or bubble within this globe. The faster the sputtering, the hotter your water is, and the darker the water, the more ""done"" the coffee is. Ideally, once you reach a nice medium heat, you want to see bubbling every few seconds or so. This represents a good ""pace"" for percolating.


Don't use percolators with plastic globes — coffee aficionados claim that exposing hot coffee to plastic can cause the taste of the plastic to transfer into the coffee, resulting in a foul-tasting brew.

, Depending on how strong you like your coffee and how hot you're heating your water, your percolator's ideal brewing time may differ. Note that brewing for ten minutes at the suggested medium pace will produce a pot of coffee that's fairly strong compared to an average pot of drip coffee. Obviously, for weaker coffee, you'll want to brew for less time, and for even stronger coffee, you'll want to brew for longer.


Using a kitchen timer to keep track of your coffee's progress can be a smart idea, but don't simply set your timer and come back when it goes off — if you do this, it's easy to over-heat your coffee and create a bitter, muddy product.

, When your coffee has finished percolating, carefully remove it from its heat source (use a towel or oven mitts to avoid burning yourself). Immediately open the percolator's lid and carefully remove the basket which contains the soaked coffee grounds. Discard the grounds (or recycle them). Don't leave the grounds in the percolator — if you do this, they can spill into your cup when you pour the coffee and may continue to make your coffee stronger by dripping into the coffee in the reservoir.


After removing the basket with the grounds, your perked coffee is ready to serve. Enjoy your strong, old-fashioned style cup of joe!

, Automatic electric percolators operate according to the same physical principals as stove top percolators, but they generally require less work and supervision on your part. To begin, add your water and coffee as you normally would. Decide how much coffee you want, then add this amount of water to the bottom chamber. Remove the basket from the upper chamber and add your coffee grounds.


The ratios for the amount of grounds you should use for your water is the same for electric percolators as it is for stove top percolators — use 1 tablespoon per cup of water for strong coffee and 1 teaspoon for weak coffee.

, Once your percolator is assembled and full of coffee and water, your work is basically done. Connect the percolator's plug to a nearby outlet. Most percolators will begin to heat automatically, but if yours has an ""on"" button, you may need to hit this at this point. Your percolator's internal heating element should activate and begin to heat the water in the bottom chamber, causing it to cycle up the tube, through the coffee grounds, and back down into the reservoir as it would in a standard percolator.

, All you need to do now is wait. Most electric percolators take about as long to finish brewing as stove top percolators — usually about seven to ten minutes. Many electric percolators will have an internal sensor that prevent them from heating the coffee past its optimal temperature, but if yours doesn't, you may need to watch the percolator as it brews. Otherwise, assuming there are no small children or pets in the area who may burn themselves on the hot machine, simply set a timer and let your percolator do the rest.


Remember that if you ever see steam coming out of the percolator, it's brewing too hot. If you see this with an electric percolator, unplug immediately and allow it to cool for a minute or two before re-connecting it.

, When your timer goes off (or, if you have a percolator with an automatic timer, it shuts off automatically), unplug your percolator. Carefully open the lid and remove the upper basket containing the soaked coffee grounds. Discard these as you wish.


At this point, you're done! Serve your coffee and enjoy!

, As noted above, coffee that's brewed in a percolator can tend towards being somewhat strong, bitter, and ""muddy"". This is because, unlike many other brewing methods, percolating involves continuously recirculating water through the coffee grounds, rather than simply allowing it to drain through once. However, with a few simple tricks, it's possible to make coffee in a percolator that's not over-strong. For instance, starting with a coffee roast that's classified as being light, smooth, low-caffeine, and minimally acidic can help reduce the bitterness of percolated coffee. Though percolating will usually make your coffee stronger than it would otherwise be, starting with ""mild"" ingredients helps minimize this effect.


If you're looking for weaker coffee, try buying a roast labelled ""mild"" or ""smooth"" from your favorite coffee brand (like Folgers, etc.) or opt for a ""dark"" roast — though these can be bitter, they have lower caffeine content and acidity than light roasts. If you have the money to spend, you might also want to try a mild specialty roast, like Oromo Yirgacheffe Ground Fair trade Coffee.Also, don't forget that you also always have the option to brew decaf!

, When it comes to coffee grounds, in general, the finer the beans are ground, the more quickly they'll transfer their flavor to the water and the stronger coffee they'll produce. Because of this, when you use a percolator to make coffee, you'll usually want to use a coarse grind. Coarse-ground beans will interact with the water less quickly, resulting in a final pot that's not quite as strong as it would otherwise be.


If you have your own coffee grinder, try using its ""coarse"" setting. Otherwise, if you buy your coffee pre-ground, look for a ""coarse"" label on the packaging.

, When percolating, temperature is key — too cold and the water won't travel up the central tube, but too hot and you risk having an over-done cup of coffee that unappealingly strong. For optimal brewing, you'll usually want to keep your water between 195 - 200o F for the duration of the percolating process. This is just below the point that water begins to steam and boil (212o F (100o C)), but not so cold that the brewing process will be needlessly prolonged.


Try using a kitchen thermometer to check the temperature of your water as your coffee percolates. For an accurate reading, try not to touch the thermometer to the hot metal sides of the pot — instead, carefully submerge it in the liquid.

, Percolated coffee has a reputation for being somewhat cloudy or ""muddy"". Luckily, in most cases, this is easy to fix. Simply allow your coffee to sit for a few minutes after percolating. This gives the particles and sediment suspended in the water time to settle, resulting in a clearer cup of coffee.


Note that doing this can produce a ""puddle"" of sediment at the bottom of your cup when you're done drinking. You may want to avoid drinking this, as some coffee drinkers find this to be bitter and unappetizing.

, If you can't get your percolated coffee to taste better with any other method, simply reduce the amount of time that you allow it to percolate for. As noted throughout the article, percolating coffee can produce an unusually strong final product compared to other methods, so reducing the amount of time that you allow your coffee to brew can counteract this. Though most brewing instructions will recommend percolating for about seven to ten minutes, it's OK to brew for as short as four or five minutes if it results in coffee that you find more palatable.


If you're unsure of how long to percolate your coffee, err on the short side, but be willing to experiment to find the perfect brewing length that's just right for you.

Coffee shops will brew black coffee in several ways.Drip coffee is made by letting hot water flow through coarsely-ground coffee beans. It’s usually kept on tap in large urns at coffee shops. This is a standard choice, but may be less flavorful than other brew methods.
Pour overs are made by carefully pouring hot water over coffee grounds suspended in a filter over a container. These are usually made by the cup, allowing the hot water to sit with the grounds for longer and extract more flavor.
French press coffee is made by letting coffee grounds sit in hot water for several minutes in a press pot. The coffee is then poured out, leaving the grounds behind. This method produces a bold flavor.;
, Most coffee shops will have a variety of coffee types available for brewed coffee. Each has a particular flavor profile and caffeine content, which your barista will be happy to describe for you.Light roasts are very mild in flavor. They may be called “Light City” or “Half City” roasts.
Medium roasts have a deeper color and often a nutty flavor, but are still moderate in their intensity. They are sometimes marketed as “American” or “Breakfast” roasts.
Dark roasts are rich, bold, and sometimes bitter. They may be labeled as “European,” “Espresso,” “Italian,” or “French” roasts.
Coffee shops may offer both single origin coffees (such as “Mexican” or “Sumatran”), for unique tastes, as well as blends for balanced flavors.

, Espresso is made by forcing a small amount of hot water under high pressure through finely-ground coffee beans. The intensely flavorful drink is then served in a small cup called a demitasse. A slight amount of coffee-colored foam, called crema, appears at the top of properly-pulled espresso.Espresso is sold by the “shot”: you can order a single, double (doppio), triple, and so on.
Some coffee shops serve a smaller, especially intense “ristretto” shot.
Ounce for ounce, espresso usually has more caffeine than brewed methods. However, brewed coffee is served in larger amounts, meaning an overall greater amount of caffeine.

, An americano is a blend of espresso and hot water. It is served in larger amounts, like brewed coffee, but has a richer flavor because it is made with espresso.Some locations will serve a variation called a “long black.” An americano is made by pouring hot water into espresso, while a long black is made by extracting the espresso directly into the hot water, preserving more of the crema.

, Many coffee shops will make a red eye by pouring a shot of espresso into a cup of brewed coffee. Not only does this give the coffee more flavor, it ups the caffeine content significantly., Cold brewed coffee is made by steeping coarsely ground coffee and cool water for a very long time (usually 12 to 24 hours). The unique extraction process pulls out mild, sweet flavors from the beans and leaves behind other compounds that can sometimes make coffee more bitter or acidic.


Cold brewed coffee is often poured over ice, but it can also easily be served hot--just ask your barista.

, A latte is made by blending one or more shots of espresso with steamed (not boiled) milk. The boldness of the espresso and the creaminess of the milk complement each other, making a delicious drink with enough liquid to sip for a while.You may also be able to order a flat white, which is a variation of a latte developed in Australia and New Zealand. It uses less milk in a smaller cup.

, While mochas are sometimes marketed as separate drinks, they’re really just a latte with chocolate syrup added. The combination of espresso, steamed milk, and chocolate can be irresistible., A cappuccino is espresso blended with a small amount of steamed milk and topped with milk foam. It contains less liquid than a latte, but since the espresso is not as diluted, it can be more flavorful.Cappuccinos can be served “wet,” with more steamed milk (almost like a latte), or “dry,” with almost none.

, Traditionally, a macchiato is made by topping an espresso with a small amount of milk foam to cut its intensity. Some coffee shops still serve it this way. At Starbucks and similar cafes, however, a macchiato refers to a sweet drink that is basically a latte with added flavor (like caramel syrup)., An au lait is made by blending brewed coffee and steamed milk, in roughly equal proportions. Because it is made with brewed coffee, it has a different flavor than a latte., Many coffee drinks can be made either hot or iced. Your barista may already have chilled coffee on hand, for instance, but they can also pour an espresso into cold water and ice to make an iced americano. Iced lattes and other drinks can be made in similar ways.


Certain drinks don’t do well in iced forms, however. Milk foam can really only be created by heating it, for instance, so iced cappuccinos don't really work.
Likewise, some baristas discourage iced espressos, since the shock of the cold ice can kill the drink’s flavor.
Don’t be afraid to ask your barista whether a drink can be made iced.

, Most coffee shops have a variety of syrups and other flavors available. These allow you to create everything from a vanilla latte to a mint mocha to a cinnamon spiced cappuccino. You can add flavorings to practically any drink. Baristas can also usually top your drink with whipped cream, cinnamon, chocolate powder, or other flavors.Many coffee shops feature specialized drinks made with various flavors, such as pumpkin spice lattes, or chili spiced cappuccinos.
Sugar will also be available if you want to sweeten your coffee further.

, Your barista will be happy to add an extra shot (or two, or three…) to your drink. This can make your drink richer and flavor and higher in caffeine (unless you use decaffeinated espresso). Just let your barista know that you want a “three-shot latte,” for instance.

, Coffee shops are not always consistent in the terms they use for small, medium, and large coffees. A “small” at one shop may be a “tall” at another, and a “single” at yet another. Just ask your barista to explain your shop’s lingo if you’re not sure.

Know that contracts aren’t necessary.",How to Pick Your Office Coffee Service Provider," Different coffee providers offer an array of products from fresh locally roasted coffees to mega-corporation coffee like Folgers. Coffee is the number 2 export in the world second only to Oil and one of the fastest growing industries is the specialty coffee market. Local coffee roasters can often provide a substantially better coffee to the consumer at only a little extra in price. The difference amounts in cents per cup. Three benefits can be found by purchasing local coffee; one you’re supporting your local community, two you’re helping the farmers who grow specialty coffee, and three you’re getting a better overall product.;
, Almost all coffee service providers will provide you with the equipment you need to use to brew your coffee at no additional charge. Many providers will skimp on the equipment they use to cut back on costs. However, in the long run this will cost you more in terms of time and money and will end up costing the supplier as well. There are a handful of quality coffee manufacturers who spend years developing their machines to be reliable and consistent. A faulty machine can cause problems in maintenance and in consistency. Too often machines will break down or over/under fill your carafes. The best coffee in the world can taste mediocre when brewed with shoddy equipment. Look for providers who use BUNN, Curtis, Jura or Fetco as their equipment.

, A few key things to note when interviewing your provider is to ask them how often they clean the carafes, how well they manage your inventory, and how quick they’re to respond to requests for maintenance and service. You want to find a coffee service provider who takes care of your break-room and keeps you fully stocked without overstocking you. A good coffee service provider should be able to provide same or next day service for your requests.

, A good coffee supplier should be able to provide numerous references for any job they’re bidding on. Depending on the size of the account you should ask for references that are similar to your company. Make sure to call the references and ask them about their service.

, A coffee service provider who requires a contract is something to be wary of. A good coffee supplier should rely on their strength of product and exceptional service to keep an account. Too often businesses get stuck in 1 year, 3 year, or even 5 year contracts with a coffee service provider only to find out that the customer service is shoddy and the product is abysmal. Don’t sign a contract but if you have to sign a contract, make it no longer than 1 year.

Other tropical areas may also be able to find the small tree at gardening centers or through magazines.

For people in cooler climates, it will be much harder to track down the raw materials needed to make this oil yourself. It is easier and less expensive to buy bottles of pre-made tea tree oil from reputable sources. If you buy tea tree leaves, make sure they are dried so that the oil remains inside the leaves.;
, You can buy a small set from suppliers on Amazon.com or you can borrow one from a chemistry lab. Some home brew operations allow people to rent small stills for a short period of time.

Glass and stainless steel are the best choices for stills; however, these materials can be expensive.

Start with whole, loose leaf tea (recommended).,
Choose your water.,

Taste your tea as it steeps.,
Steep repeatedly or squeeze the teabag.,
Add flavoring if necessary.",How to Make Tea With More Flavor1," The broken up leaves found in teabags may over-steep and turn bitter faster than loose leaf tea.Loose leaf tea tends to create more complex flavors.


That said it might be a myth that all tea bags contain low-quality tea. As long as you don't let the teabags grow stale, some of them can deliver a tasty cup.Most black teabags contain finely crushed tea processed with the ""CTC"" method (crush, tear, curl). Many tea aficionados prefer ""orthodox"" tea processing, which has whole leaves or large pieces.When sold in teabags, orthodox tea may also be labeled ""full leaf,"" ""pure leaf,"" or ""long leaf"".;
, The type of water you use can have a major effect on taste. If you dislike the taste of your tap water, filter it before heating it for tea. If the tea still tastes funky, try bottled water. Water labeled ""alkaline"" may be a good choice, but with so many brands of water and types of tea you may need to experiment on your own.Distilled water tends to make your tea taste flat and dull.

, Plastic kettles may leech undesirable flavors into your tea.Most quality teas should recommend an ideal water temperature, but you can use these simple rules in most cases (assuming you are near sea level):


Black teas are almost always brewed at near-boiling temperatures. Bring to a boil, then let stand for thirty seconds or so before pouring.
Most green teas brew best at 160–170ºF (70–76ºC), or when a column of steam starts rising from the water.Many Japanese green teas and some early spring Chinese green teas are extra delicate and should not be brewed above 160ºF (70ºC). Anything hotter can make these teas very bitter., Tea leaves develop more complex flavors when they can expand in the water, sometimes as much as five times their original size. If you're using loose leaf tea, don't confine it to a ""tea ball"" or another small container. Go for stainless steel, cup-shaped brew basket or brew in a teapot with a filtered spout to block the leaves.As a rule of thumb, put in 1 tsp (5 mL) tea leaves (or one teabag) for every 6 oz (175 mL) water. Feel free to add more if you're looking for a stronger taste. (Alternatively, try the Eastern style brewing method described below, which uses a higher concentration of leaves.)

, If you dislike the flavor of your tea, you may need to give it more time to steep — or you may need to take the leaves out early before they release bitter tannins. Tasting your tea every 30 seconds or so is an easy way to figure out what you prefer. You'll usually end up with good flavors if you follow the guide on the tea label, or use these rules of thumb:3–5 minutes for black tea or oolong
3 minutes for Chinese green tea
About 2 minutes for Japanese green tea
1–3 minutes for white tea

Note — water at a higher temperature extracts flavors much faster.You may need to rely on taste tests if you're eyeballing the temperature.

, Most loose leaf teas can stand up to a second or third steep in the same sitting. Pay attention to the flavors, which change subtly on each brew. Teabags lose flavor much faster; just squeeze them into the tea to get the flavors out before drinking your first cup.

, If you're trying to maximize the flavor of the tea itself, listen to the tea snobs: try to enjoy the tea plain, or add at most a splash of dairy and a small spoonful of sweetener to black tea. That said, if you're just trying to enjoy yourself, add as much as you like. Chai tea has a particularly intense flavor, and you can make it yourself by adding cloves, cardamom, and other spices.


You can also buy tea that comes pre-flavored. The highest quality teas are rarely sold this way, but that doesn't mean you can't find something you enjoy.

Choose a small brewing vessel.,
Put in a large amount of loose leaf tea.,
Rinse the leaves.,
Steep for about 30 seconds.,
Steep many more small cups.,
Try a more casual Eastern method.",How to Make Tea With More Flavor2," Most tea drinkers in East Asia prepare tea in a way Westerners may not find familiar. Traditionally, the teapot should be quite small: about 3.4–6.8 oz (100–200 mL) for a single serving. There are many traditional Chinese and Japanese tea vessels such as the gaiwan or shiboridashi designed for this purpose.For more consistent temperature control, warm the pot first by rinsing it with hot water., At a minimum, the tea leaves should cover the bottom of the vessel. It's common to fill it ¼ to ⅓ full with leaves., Pour a small amount of hot water onto the leaves, then use the lid as a strainer to pour out the water without losing the leaves. Smell the aroma released as the leaves open up., Right after rinsing, fill the teapot with hot water. Because you're using so many leaves in a small teapot, you do not need to steep as long as usual. After thirty seconds — or even just a few seconds for strong, dark tea — pour the tea into your cup.


The temperature of the water depends on the type of tea. Read the first section above for more information, or check your tea label.

, If you have the time, you can easily spend hours drinking one pot of tea. A high-quality loose leaf should stand up to many infusions. Steep for about 10–30 seconds longer each time, and pay attention to how the flavor changes with each go.It helps to have a kettle with good insulation or a warming function, to keep your water at the same temperature.

, If you enjoy the more intense, complex flavor of the Eastern brew, but don't have the time to devote to it, try putting the leaves directly in a cup or thermos. Pour on more hot water frequently as you drink, never letting the water level drop below ⅔ of the pot. This gives you an especially strong tea with some of the changing qualities of a traditional brew.If your cup has a lid, cover it after the second or third refill to keep in the heat that improves extraction.
Pour hot water along the edge of the cup to stir the leaves up and mix it with the last infusion.

Set the small teapot aside.,

 Fill the small teapot with boiling water from the reservoir of the samovar from the spigot located near the base of the samovar.,
Pour the tea.,

Add sugar or honey to taste if you take your tea sweet.  ,
Refill the small teapot with water from the reservoir so your next cup of tea will be ready when you are.,
Turn off the samovar.",How to Make Tea in a Samovar," Lift the lid of the reservoir and fill the reservoir with fresh water until it's about 1/2 to 3/4 full.  Plug the samovar into an electric outlet, turn it on, and set it to medium-high or high heat and wait for the water to come to a boil.
, When the water has come to a full rolling boil, it's time to place loose tea into the small teapot that you set aside in the previous step. Put one teaspoon of loose tea per cup that you plan to make. Add one additional teaspoon ""for the pot."" So, for example, if you plan to make 4 cups of tea, put 5 teaspoons of loose tea in the teapot (one teaspoon for each cup and one additional teaspoon ""for the pot"")., Turn the heat down to low on the samovar and return the small teapot to its place on top of the samovar. Let the tea steep for 3-5 minutes.

Be careful not to touch any metal parts of the samovar with your bare hands, as they will likely be hot from the boiling water and steam.

, When the tea has steeped long enough for your liking, pour the freshly brewed tea into a teacup or tea mug.  

Use a good potholder or thick towel when handling the small teapot to protect your hands from the heat and any steam rising from the reservoir. Fill the cup or mug only about 3/4 of the way full with the brewed tea (or less full if the tea looks very dark). Because the teapot is small, the tea is more concentrated.
You might want to strain the tea as you are pouring it into the cup or mug through a small tea strainer to avoid bits of loose tea in your cup.

,,, Refill the reservoir as well to ensure that it doesn't boil dry.  

There you have it, endless cups of fragrant rich tea!

, Finally, when you have drunk your fill of tea, turn off the samovar (you can also unplug it for good measure), discard the used tea leaves and rinse out the small teapot so it's ready for your next tea party."

However, you can also use Lipton, Tetley, or any other brands of black tea., Make sure you're using a Pyrex glass container or another container that can hold boiling water. The glass container should be at room temperature -- if it's cold, it may crack., This will give you a nice, strong tea. Do not put tea bags directly into boiling water. This will cause a bitter taste or may even make the bags burst.

, You can gently press the tea bags against the Pyrex cup using a wooden spoon, but you should not squeeze the tea bags or the tea will have a bitter taste. If you'd like to protect the tea from being bitter, add 1/8 teaspoon of baking soda just in case.

,, Add a cup of sugar to the mixture and stir until the sugar is dissolved. The hot water will melt the sugar and make it dissolve in the tea. If you add sugar to cool water, it won't fully dissolve. You can use artificial sweetener instead of sugar, too. It'll be more healthy, but not quite as tasty.

, This will distribute the flavor of the tea and will fill the pitcher. Use fresh cool filtered water instead of tap water for a less cloudy tea.

, Do not put the pitcher directly into the refrigerator -- let it cool to room temperature on the counter. If you put hot tea into the fridge, it will turn cloudy.

Don't ask for drinks after the bar has closed.,
Be respectful.,
Know how to tip when you travel.",How to Tip a Bartender," In some circles it's common practice to leave a large tip on the first round. Depending on the bar, leave between 50-100% to make a good first impression.Some bartenders might think you want special treatment for leaving such a large tip. Don't act like the bartender owes you anything, and don't make a big deal about leaving a good tip.Even if you don't tip large on the first round, you should at least leave something. Don't stiff your bartender, especially on the first round.;
, If you order a beer or a glass of wine, you can usually get away with tipping between $1-2. If you order a cocktail, tip between $2-3. The longer your bartender spends making your drink, the more you should tip them., If you're paying in cash, make sure to leave a tip for every drink. A good rule to follow is about $1 a drink. In nicer bars, leave $2 per drink.If you're paying with a card, calculate 20% of your tab at the end of the night. For more expensive cocktails, it's a better idea to go with 20% of the tab rather than tipping by the drink. If you have trouble calculating the appropriate tip amount, just divide your total costs by 5., If your bartender was particularly quick to serve you, or made each drink perfectly, reward his good service. It's the bartender's job to make sure you have a good time. Not only is he responsible for making your drinks, he's also responsible for making you feel welcome in the bar. If you appreciated the extra lengths your bartender went to improve your evening, leave a big tip., Don't try to convince your bartender to give you a free drink in exchange for a tip. You're asking the bartender to steal, which could get her fired.Don't ask your bartender to make you a strong drink unless you are willing to pay for it. If you want a stronger drink, order a double.If you do end up getting a strong drink, remember to reward your bartender with a nice tip., Bartenders have a lot of customers to serve, and they have to give each one their full attention. Don't wave money at the bartender to get his attention. Just make eye contact, and wait your turn.Don't slam your hands on the bar or yell to get the bartender's attention. Don't do anything obnoxious in the hopes that you'll get served next. Chances are, if you're rude, you're going to wait longer., When the bartender approaches you for your order, be ready. Don't hold up the line trying to decide what you want.When ordering a mixed drink, start your order with the type of liquor you want. If you have a brand preference, say so. Don't say, ""Can I get a Whiskey and Coke with Jack Daniels."" Instead, say, ""Can I get a Jack and Coke?"", Bars give a ""last call"" warning several minutes before they start closing up. This is your last opportunity to order a drink. Bars give their patrons a few minutes after close to finish their drinks, but they legally cannot sell you another drink., Your bartender is a human being, and deserves to be treated with respect. Don't boss your bartender around, and don't make demands.Don't argue with your bartender over the amount of your tab. Your bartender has a better idea of how much you drank than you did.Don't talk on your phone while you're waiting in line., Tipping customs are different depending on where you are. In the U.S. you are expected to tip no matter what. Even if you have bad service, it is still considered rude to stiff someone. In Japan, however, tipping is an insult.In the U.K., you wouldn't leave a tip, but you would offer to buy the bartender a drink.If you travel to a place and you're not familiar with their tipping customs, just ask your bartender."

Read the menu carefully.,
Handle cash transactions with care.,
Keep an eye on your bank account.,
Be wary of coupon offers.",How to Protect Yourself from Common Restaurant Scams1," While not a scam in the strict sense, restaurant menus are sometimes designed to mislead customers who aren’t paying close enough attention. This is especially prevalent in places with large, complex menus that offer lots of different options. Make a note of each item’s description and price, how it’s served and whether any additional costs may apply.For example, the price of a cheeseburger may seem fairly standard until you see that French fries have to be ordered separately.
Specify the exact size of the item you’re ordering in establishments that offer different portion sizes to avoid being upcharged without your awareness.;
, You never really know what a waiter is doing when they walk away with your money. It’s not uncommon to get incorrect change by mistake on occasion, but a desperate grifter can intentionally attempt to shortchange you or simply pocket the remainder of a cash payment. They’re usually counting on the fact that you won’t notice, or that you’ll choose not to say anything even if you do in order to avoid confrontation.Always count your change to verify that you’ve received the correct sum before leaving the table or counter.It isn’t customary for a waiter to assume to their tip is included in the payment. If your waiter takes your money and doesn’t return, flag them down or ask to speak to a manager.

, Credit card scams are becoming increasingly common as more and more people pay with plastic. It can be disconcertingly easy for your card info to get into the hands of a dishonest employee, who is then free to take it on a spending spree. If you have reason to believe that your card number has been stolen, cancel your card immediately and have your bank refund the fraudulent purchases.Watch your bank statements closely and look for any suspicious purchases or payments that you don’t remember making., Unscrupulous restaurants will sometimes use discount coupons to lure customers in, then claim the coupons are no longer redeemable or tack on unadvertised “service” charges. Read the fine print and look for hidden expiration dates or other covert clauses that might render any coupons you’ve been given invalid.Don’t accept coupons that are being handed out on the street. These promotions are almost always a ruse designed to bring in customers.Restaurant gift cards, rewards cards and customer loyalty programs should also be examined for any shady conditions that may come back to haunt you on future visits.

Check the prices of street food items.,
Know what you’re getting in foreign eateries.,
Look for drink prices at bars and nightclubs.,
Only buy bottled water that’s properly sealed.",How to Protect Yourself from Common Restaurant Scams2," Not all food trucks and stalls post their prices in plain sight, which can cause problems should a vendor try to charge you too much for an order. Give the menu a thorough scan before you place your order, if there is one. Otherwise, use your best judgment in determining whether what you’re being asked to pay is acceptable.


See if you can overhear what the vendor is charging other customers. If your total comes out to something different (or if prices are just too steep in general), you may want to find someplace else to grab a bite.
Overcharging patrons that don’t speak the language is one particular scam that’s run everyday in countries that receive heavy tourism. It’s easy to pull off, as the customer will rarely take the time to make sure they’ve paid the exact amount., Unfamiliarity with other languages can also play a part in confounded patrons being taken for a ride. Ask a member of the waitstaff if they can explain menu offerings to you in a language you understand. Find out if vegetarian and seafood dishes are fresh. Never order something if the price is not clearly displayed beside it.In most cases, it will be safest to order items that you recognize or are able to identify.
Don’t feel pressured into ordering dishes that the waitstaff recommends to you. More often than not, these will usually be the most expensive items on the menu.

, Before you hand over your credit card to start a tab, ask to look over a drink menu or search for an overhead board that lists drink specials and their prices. Certain nightlife spots have been known to grossly inflate the price of drinks because they think that no one is paying attention. If you don’t remain vigilant, a night out on the town could turn into a forfeited paycheck.If possible, pay for each round of drinks individually, and use cash.
Refuse offers to drink with total strangers, no matter how friendly they seem. This type of social engagement is often a prelude to conning you into paying the bill., There is a popular scam being run in big cities that involves filling discarded plastic bottles with tap water, then selling them to overheated tourists at a high price. When buying water, always check to make sure that the container is properly sealed. Try to get drinking water from convenience stores or vending machines whenever possible.Examine the quality of bottled water before you drink it. Water sourced from public taps may be murky or slightly discolored, or have sediment floating around in it.
Get in the habit of carrying a thermos on hot days and during long outings when you think you may get thirsty."

Decide how to share the dining expense ahead of time.,
Share it evenly.,
Let each person do their own math.,
Appoint a person to determine everyone's share.,
Decide on the form of payment.",How to Split the Check," The check comes at the end of the meal, but make it less awkward by discussing how it will be split up before you order.;
, One option for splitting the check is to simply divide it up among the people who are at the table. This works well if you all shared from several plates, or if everyone got the same thing. For example, if you go to a restaurant for a buffet and everyone orders a soft drink, all of you will have the same costs. The best thing to do is to divide the total, including tip, by the number of people in your party.

, Pass the check around the table and let each person figure out how much they owe. Remind everyone to include tax and tip in their grand total. One person can act as the ""banker"" by collecting everyone's money.


Use a calculator or a cell phone. Most phones have a calculator tool. PayPal even has a ""Split the Check"" application that will transfer money between parties at dinner. You will need to download this application onto your mobile smartphone or tablet computer.

, You may have someone at the table who is very good at splitting the check and quickly summing up what each person owes. Allow that individual to give everyone a total, and collect the money.

, It is possible not everyone will have cash. If several people need to use credit cards or debit cards, be sure to give your server specific instructions on how much to charge on each card. It might help to write down separate totals on the check.

Identify your target demographic.,
Create a website.,
List the restaurant on online local listings.,
Market directly to nearby businesses.,
Make the news.,
Participate in local festivals.",How to Promote a Restaurant1," Before you can promote your restaurant effectively, you'll have to define who your ideal customers are. Identify who your restaurant is best designed to serve. Are you a family establishment or more of an intimate, date restaurant? Are you seeking to attract urbanites or rural customers? Deciding who to focus on will inform your advertising strategies and content., Many customers will visit your website before visiting your restaurant, so make sure your website is a reflection your restaurant's level of quality and professionalism. A good website will allow you to inform, communicate with, and draw in customers. A great website will do those things and also be easy to use and well-designed. For this reason, if you can afford it, you should hire a professional website designer to create your website.


You should regularly update your website with specials, menu changes, and events. Posting content regularly will also cause your website to appear higher in search results.
You can also add the ability to receive online orders or accept online reservations through your website.If you don't want to pay a website designer, or can't afford one yet, there are plenty of resources online that can provide you with easy-to-use website templates.
Be sure to post both your hours and your full menu on your website., Online local listings websites, such as Google Places, Bing Places for Business, and Yelp direct local web users who search for your food type or restaurants near them to your restaurant's profile or website. They also provide spaces for you to post restaurant information, pictures, and updates. Customers can post pictures and reviews of your restaurant as well. Start by claiming or creating a profile for your restaurant on one of these websites, then move to the others.


Make sure your restaurant's information, like its name and address, are consistent and correct across these platforms., One way to get your name out there, especially when you've just opened, is to visit businesses within walking distance or within a short drive from your restaurant. On a slower business day, like Monday or Tuesday, have a team of your employees or friends visit these businesses to promote your restaurant by handing out business cards, flyers, or special discount cards. Make sure that they reach workers who would consider visiting your restaurant for lunch or for an after work happy hour., If you want to reach more customers quickly, take advantage of the media. Try sending out a press release or contacting local news agencies if your restaurant does or is involved in something newsworthy. Newsworthy events might include a unique and exciting new menu item, a celebrity eating in your restaurant, attending a food festivals, an award you won, or some charitable event put on by your restaurant. If your event if exciting enough, you might get local or regional news coverage that can draw in customers from all over.Be sure to share links to any news coverage you receive on social media so that more people will see it and possibly share it with their friends., Make a point of searching for local food or music festivals regularly. Whether they are charitable or for-profit festivals, anywhere you can get your food into potential customers' mouths is a good place for you to earn future business. Provide snack-sized versions of your popular dishes or specially-made cocktails to festival-goers to give them a taste of what your restaurant can offer. Just be sure to also have promotional materials (business cards, flyers, etc.) handy so that they remember the restaurant's name.


This is also a good opportunity for you, as the business owner, to interact with customers directly."

Be clear about what you’re ordering.,
Demand to speak to a manager.,
Leave without paying.,
Pursue legal action.",How to Protect Yourself from Common Restaurant Scams3," At the risk of coming across as condescending or rude, do everything you can to ensure that your order is recorded and charged correctly. Say the whole name of the item, have your waiter repeat your order back to you, and be sure to highlight the price listed on the menu. Don’t be shy about gesturing or visually indicating what it is you want, especially if the menu is confusing or unclear.If the menu is written in a language you can’t read, point to the item you want to order and use what words and phrases you know to make your intentions apparent.
Ask the meaning of names and other terms you don’t understand.

, No one likes confrontation, but sometimes there’s no other choice than to have a higher authority intervene. Restaurant scams tend to take place without the knowledge of the owners and managers, who will usually do everything in their power to smooth things out for the customer. When speaking to a manager, describe what happened at length and look for ways to resolve the problem without resorting to storming out in anger.Emphasize that what happened is nobody’s fault, and that you’re only interested in resolving the dispute.
Threatening to undermine the restaurant’s reputation with a nasty review can often help you rectify problems more effectively than simply complaining.

, This is only recommended in situations where you’ve already discussed your concerns with your waiter and also spoken to a manager who’s proven unhelpful. If you get the feeling that you’re being coerced into paying for overpriced or poor quality food, and you haven’t already eaten it, you’re within your right to walk away. Make sure you let restaurant personnel know why you find their handling of the matter unacceptable.There’s an unspoken agreement that restaurants are expected to live up to certain standards of service. If they fail to do so, the cost is your business.
Don’t use fictitious complaints as a ploy to get free or discounted food. This just makes you the scammer.

, If the issue is bad enough, or it happens multiple times, it may be worth filing a formal complaint. U.S. citizens have the option of reporting the incident to the Better Business Bureau, while other frustrated diners worldwide can seek aid from an equivalent agency if one exists in their country. It may even be possible to file a lawsuit against a restaurant that actively seeks to rip off its patrons.Be sure to provide as much specific information as you can about the nature of the scam while filling out your report.
Seek the aid of an attorney in bringing legal charges against a conniving business.Filing a complaint won’t prevent a bad experience, but it may keep others from receiving similar treatment.

Create accounts on the major social media networks.,
Focus on images.,
Interact with customers.,
Manage online reviews.,
Work with mobile apps.",How to Promote a Restaurant2," Start by signing up your restaurant for an account on the most-used social media networks, like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest. Then, try to post interesting content on your pages regularly. You can post pictures, event details, links to relevant news articles, special menu items, discounts, or anything else that relates to your restaurant. You can also offer contests to followers, like a competition for the best picture taken of your food.


Be sure to also post links to your website so you can increase traffic to it.You can also post short-term deals on social media, such as ""come in today between 4 and 6 p.m. for $5 appetizers."" This will make social media followers feel like they are getting special deals and inspire others to keep up with your page updates., It's much easier for a web user to examine pictures of your food or restaurant than it is for them to read through information. For this reason, focus on providing visual representations of your restaurant, like professional-looking pictures of your food and location. You should also post pictures of your staff, events, food-making process, and especially of happy customers. You should also keep an eye out for good photos taken by customers. ""Like"" them and share them across your social media channels whenever you see a good one., Your goal should be to make your customers feel like they are a part of your restaurant's community. That is, be sure to respond to comments you receive, pictures of your restaurant posted on social media, or any mentions that your receive. Express gratitude for positive media in whatever form it takes. You can also let customers into your kitchen and food preparation process by preparing a ""how it's made"" video that shows your chef creating a popular dish.


Similarly, you can have other photos or videos that explain how or where you get your ingredients or your chef's process for designing new menu items., Many people searching for a restaurant of a particular type will make their decision based on your average rating. It goes without saying then, that you should strive for a high aggregate review score. To do so, actively invite your customers to rate your restaurant online if they enjoyed their experience. And, on local listing or social media sites, respond your reviewers where possible. Thank those that left you positive feedback for their business and address negative comments with your side of the story or an offer to remedy whatever problem exists., These days, many people are using their smartphones to locate and interact with local restaurants. Apps like Open Table, TripAdvisor, Yelp, and UrbanSpoon allow people to find restaurants near them quickly and use reviews and other data to make a decision about which one to eat at. You can benefit from these quick decisions by joining these apps' databases and building reputable profiles on each. Be sure to add pictures and work with good reviews like you would on any other type of social media."
"
Share customer testimonials.,
Use promotions.,
Hold events.,
Stay in contact with previous customers.,
Keep the focus on the food.",How to Promote a Restaurant3," Try placing comment cards near the exit to your restaurant so that you can receive comments from customers. You can also ask customers for feedback or look out for social media posts about your website to find customer comments. When you have a collection of good quotes, you can then use these customer testimonials in advertisements, on social media posts, or on your website.


You can also pull feedback from reviews on local listings websites., Promotions can be useful both for gaining new customers and for earning return business. However, many restaurateurs advise against offering discounts on your food, as it devalues what you offer. That is, customers will come to think that the discounted price is what your food is worth. Instead, try offering free add-ons to meals, like a free appetizer or dessert with the purchase of an entree. This brings in customers and also gets them to try menu items that they otherwise might not be willing to order., Plan special events in your restaurant to draw in customers for a special purpose besides simply eating your food. For example, you can hold a daily happy hour, advertise specials for sporting events, or host a wine tasting. Alternately, you can host closed parties, charitable events, business socials, or food tastings. Hosting these events may help you draw in a large crowd and earn some return customers., The best way to stay in touch with customers is by having them sign up for an email newsletter. Sign up for an online emailing service like MailChimp, GetResponse, or Robly to get started. Then, start collecting customer emails by including a mention of the newsletter on receipts and on flyers around the restaurant. You can offer a special discount or deal to those who subscribe to your newsletter. You can also invite your subscribers to special events or offer competitions through email to your loyal customers.


If your receive any questions, concerns, or comments through email, be sure to respond to them., Remember that restaurant promotion is only part of building a successful restaurant. You'll have to maintain friendly and professional service, as well as excellent food quality, to keep customers coming back. Make sure that you have these areas covered before spending more time and effort on promotion.

A tea kettle is the recommended method, followed closely by a standard saucepan. In either case, fill the cookware with enough water for the coffee amount you want to make and place it on the stove. Boil using medium to high heat.
Microwaving water can be dangerous if not done carefully.Place the water in an open microwave-safe cup and stick a non-metallic object, like a wooden chopstick, into the water. Heat the water slowly in 1 to 2 minute intervals until it reaches your desired temperature.
An electric hot pot is easy to use. Pour enough water into the hot pot for your coffee and plug the device in. Turn the knob somewhere between medium and full heat, and let heat for a few minutes until the water begins to bubble or boil.;
, Add enough pre-ground coffee to your largest liquid measuring cup to make as many servings of coffee as you need.









You should use roughly 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 mL) of coffee grounds per 1 cup (250 mL) of water.
Use your largest liquid measuring cup, especially if you plan to make more than one mug of coffee.
If you do not own a large measuring cup, you could also use a large heat-proof bowl or pitcher.

, Pour the hot water directly over the grounds in the measuring cup.









For this method, no filters are needed. The coffee grounds and water can blend.

, Allow the coffee to steep for 3 minutes. Stir well, and steep for an additional 3 minutes.

, Take a 1/2-inch (1.25 cm) piece of fresh ginger and slice it into thin pieces. Add the ginger to the saucepan and pour in 2 1⁄2 cups (590 ml) of water. Turn the heat to high so the spiced water boils. Reduce the heat to medium-low so the water simmers. Simmer the spiced water for 2 minutes.Simmering the spices will release some of their flavor. You'll continue to simmer the spices once you add the tea, so avoid boiling them. This will prevent a bitter flavor from developing.

Pour the coffee, and serve immediately.",How to Make Coffee With a Coffee Press," To ensure that you wind up with the right amount of grounds for your coffee, you must carefully measure out the coffee beans. For 32 ounces (946 ml) of coffee, which is approximately 3 to 4 servings, use a measuring cup to measure a ½ cup (51 g) of beans.The standard size for most coffee presses is 32 ounces (946 ml), but you can make fewer servings if you prefer. For a single serving, measure 2 tablespoons (13 g) of beans. For 2 servings, measure a ¼ cup (26 g) of beans.;
, Once you’ve measured the beans, place them in a coffee grinder. Use the coarsest setting to grind the beans down until they resemble bread crumbs.For the best flavor, coffee beans should always be ground just before brewing (ideally within 15 minutes). Grinding before this will lead to stale, oxidized coffee.
In most cases, the finer you grind the beans, the weaker the coffee will be. The coarser the grind, the stronger the coffee will be. Pay attention to the grinder setting that you use, so you can adjust it the next time if you aren’t happy with the taste of your coffee., To make 32 ounces (946 ml) of coffee, you’ll need to heat 4 cups (946 ml) of water. The water should be 195 degrees Fahrenheit (91 degrees Celsius), which is below boiling. Boil the water in an electric or stovetop kettle, but then remove the water from the heat and allow it to cool for approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute before making the coffee.If you’re making a single serving of coffee, heat 1 cup (237 ml) of water. For two servings, heat 2 cups (474 ml) of water.
You can use tap water to make your coffee. However, be sure to drink some first to ensure that it doesn’t have a bad taste. If it does taste odd, use filtered or bottled water instead., Examine your coffee press to ensure that the plunger device inside that pushes the grounds to the bottom of the pot to express their flavor into the hot water is working properly. Remove the lid and plunger, and place the ground coffee beans in the press.You can find coffee presses that feature glass or plastic pots. Unless you're traveling with your press and have to worry about possible breakage, it's best to use a glass press. Plastic pots can sometimes affect the taste of your coffee.To make clean up easier, make sure that your press is dishwasher-safe.

, After you’ve boiled and cooled the water, it’s time to add it to the grounds in the coffee press. However, you don’t want to add all of the water at once. Instead, start by pouring just enough into the press to fill it halfway. Allow the coffee and water mixture to sit for approximately 1 minute., When the coffee and water have sat for a minute, the grounds will likely float to the top and form a thick layer. Use a spoon to stir the mixture vigorously so you break up the layer of grounds.When you’re stirring the mixture, it helps to use an up and down motion with the spoon to ensure that the grounds and water are well mixed.

, After you’ve mixed the water and grounds, you can pour the rest of the heated water into the press. Use a circular motion as you’re adding it so all of the grounds are soaked.If you prefer, you can add all of the water at once and stir immediately to combine the coffee and water. However, it can be more difficult to ensure that all of the grounds are soaked if you pour in the water all at once., Once you’ve added all of the water, place the lid on the press. Don’t press the coffee yet, though -- allow the mixture to sit for another 3 minutes so it has time to fully steep.As you become more experienced in making coffee with your press, you may realize that certain types of coffee taste better if they are steeped longer or shorter than 3 minutes. Adjust the brewing time to your personal tastes., After the coffee has steeped for several minutes, it’s time to plunge the press. Push down on the press gently until it reaches the bottom of the carafe.Pushing on the press too hard can agitate the coffee too much and leave it bitter. If you feel resistance when you’re plunging on it, back up the press a couple of inches and plunge it again until you get to the bottom.

, When you’re plunged the press all the way to the bottom, the coffee is ready. Pour it into cups or a serving carafe, and serve immediately."

Serve as desired.",How to Make Cuban Coffee1," Cuban style coffee is usually a powerful, aromatic Arabica roast, most commonly found abroad from the brands Bustelo, Pilon, and La Llave.If grinding beans yourself for a traditional moka pot, grind to a slightly coarse powder, not as fine as you would for espresso.;
, Traditionally, Cubans make cafecito using a stovetop moka pot, which creates a dark, rich brew similar to espresso. Fill the basket of the moka pot with the coffee and level it off with your finger, but do not tamp it down. Pour water into the lower pot, up to the safety valve.


An espresso machine will also work. You can use any coffeemaker in a pinch, but the result won't be as strong as a traditional Cuban coffee.
Some brewers like to preheat the water in a kettle to just below boiling. This will extract the coffee faster and prevent the grounds from overheating., Screw the parts of the moka pot together and place it on the stove burner on medium-low heat. Leave the lid open so you can see inside.

, The key to Cuban coffee is the foam made from whipping sugar and coffee together, called espuma or espumita. Traditional Cuban families may use as much as 1 to 1½ tablespoons (15–22 mL) sugar per espresso shot (one demitasse cup). Many people nowadays prefer something somewhat less sweet, as low as 1–2 tsp (5–10 mL) sugar instead.Raw sugar is traditional, but granulated white sugar will work fine., As soon as your moka pot releases enough coffee to cover the base, pour just enough onto the sugar to moisten it. It's important to do this right away, so don't let your moka pot out of sight.It's better to add too little coffee than too much. If you end up with a liquid, try again with a new cup.

, Beat the coffee into the sugar with a metal spoon as hard as you can for two or three minutes. At first, this should be a dry, dark paste. As you beat in air, the mixture will become a light caramel color and foam slightly., Once your coffee is ready, pour it slowly over the sugar paste. Stir until a brown foam (the espumita) rises to the top.


Pour the coffee carefully into espresso cups, without breaking apart the espumita. You can spoon the foam directly onto each cup to make sure everyone can satisfy their sweet tooth.

, Here are a few traditional ways to drink Cuban coffee:Cafecito — black, with no additions besides the espumita


Cortadito — blended with an equal amount of milk

Cafe con leche — mixed with steamed milk to taste, and sometimes with a little salt and butter

Pour the water over your coffee filter bundle.,
Steep.,
Remove the filter and enjoy.",How to Make Coffee without a Coffee Maker2," Use a stovetop kettle, saucepan, microwave, or electric hot pot.


If heating water in a kettle or saucepan, fill it with enough water and set it to a boil on the stove using medium to high heat.
To microwave water, place the water in a microwave-safe dish with a wooden chopstick or other non-metallic utensil. Heat in 1 or 2 minute intervals.
Fill an electric hot pot with as much water as necessary and plug it in. Set the heat to medium or high and let boil.

, Scoop enough pre-ground coffee into the center of a single coffee filter and tie the filter into a bundle using string or twine.









Tie the bundle tight to prevent coffee grounds from slipping through into the liquid. In essence, you are creating the coffee equivalent to a tea bag.
Leave enough twine or string at the end to hang out of the mug. This will give you something to pull the bundle out with.
This method works best if you only intend to prepare one cup of coffee at a time. If you want to prepare enough coffee to fill multiple mugs, you should create as many coffee filter bundles as you need and place one in each mug.
The coffee produced by this method is slightly less strong than that produced using the strainer method. As a result, you should use at least 2 Tbsp (30 mL) of grounds per 1 cup (250 mL) of water. Anything less may produce weak coffee.

, Place the bundle in your mug and pour enough hot water directly over it to fill.









If using multiple bundles of coffee, place each one in its own mug. Do not try to create a big batch by combining the filters into a large bowl or measuring cup.

, Let the coffee steep for 3 to 4 minutes.


If you prefer stronger coffee, you could steep it for 4 to 5 minutes.
For weaker coffee, steep it for 2 to 3 minutes.
No stirring is needed during this time.

, Tug on the string to pull the filter bundle out. Add cream and sugar as desired, and serve.









Give the bundle a slight squeeze with a spoon against the side of the cup to force out extra liquid. Since the liquid inside the bundle had prolonged contact with the grounds, it will make the coffee stronger if you squeeze it back into the mug.

Place the coffee grounds and water in a small saucepan.,
Heat to a boil.,
Let boil for 2 minutes.,
Pour the coffee into your cup.",How to Make Coffee without a Coffee Maker3," Give the mixture a slight stir to help combine them.









Use about 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 mL) of coffee grounds per 1 cup (250 mL) of water you add.

, Place the saucepan on the stove and turn the heat to medium-high. Allow the water to reach a boil.









Stir the coffee occasionally as it comes to a boil.

, Start the timer after the water reaches a full boil. Let the coffee boil for a full two minutes, uncovered, before removing the saucepan from the heat.


As soon as you turn off the heat, the grounds should sink to the bottom of the saucepan.

, If you pour slowly and carefully, the coffee grounds should remain at the bottom of the saucepan, making a strainer unnecessary.









That said, you can still pour the coffee through a strainer if you have one. Doing so will prevent any stray grounds from entering your mug as you pour the coffee.

A kettle is an ideal option, but saucepans work in a very similar way. Fill the kettle or saucepan with enough water for your batch of coffee. Place it on the stove and heat, over medium to high heat, until the water begins to simmer or boil.
Microwave water by placing it in a microwave-safe dish. Insert a wooden chopstick or other non-metallic utensil to prevent the water from super-heating and microwave in short intervals, no greater than 2 minutes each, until the water is hot enough.
You can heat water in an electric hot pot by simply adding enough water to the device, plugging it in, and setting the dial to medium or high heat.

, Add 1 Tbsp (15 mL) of coffee grounds to your press per 4 oz (125 mL) of water.









A coffee aficionado would insist on using freshly ground coffee, but you could also use pre-ground coffee.

, Pour the water directly over the grounds in your press, making sure that all the grounds are saturated.









Change where the water falls to ensure the grounds are evenly saturated.
As you pour, you should notice a small ""bloom"" forming at the surface of the coffee slurry.
Use a chopstick to stir the slurry and bring out the bloom further.

, Place the filter assembly on the top of the press and let the coffee steep for a few minutes.









For a small press pot, 2 to 3 minutes should be enough time.
A larger press pot may need to steep for a full 4 minutes.

, Grasp the plunger stick on the top of the plunger assembly and press down.









Press the plunger down evenly and in a steady manner. If the plunger becomes crooked, the grounds could escape into the upper portion of the press.

, Pour the directly from the press pot and into your coffee cups.









Hold the lid to prevent it from sliding around or popping off as you pour.

",How to Make Coffee without a Coffee Maker5," Without a coffee maker, water can be boiled using a tea kettle, saucepan, electric hot pot, or microwave oven.


To boil water in a kettle or saucepan, fill the cookware with enough water for your coffee and place it on the stove. Set the eye for medium to high heat and remove once the water begins to simmer or boil.
Boil water in the microwave by pouring it into a microwave-safe cup and inserting a wooden chopstick or other non-metallic utensil inside. Heat for 1 to 2 minute intervals until the water begins to bubble.
Heat your water using an electric hot put by filling the device with water and plugging it in to an electric outlet. Set the dial to a medium or high setting and heat until the water is ready.

, Each brand of instant coffee varies, but you should usually use between 1 and 2 tsp (5 and 10 mL) of instant coffee granules per 6 oz (180 mL) of water.









Place the instant coffee granules directly in your coffee mug.

, Pour the hot water over the coffee granules. Stir well to mix, then add sugar and cream as desired.

Mix coffee grounds with sugar.,
Place loosely in the moka pot basket.,
Pour in water.,
Brew as usual.",How to Make Cuban Coffee2," If you have a moka pot, you can put the sugar directly in with the coffee grounds. This makes a weaker espumita (foam), but it's easy to make in a rush and might caramelize the sugar a little more.For moderate sweetness, use 1–2 tsp (5–10 mL) sugar for each espresso-sized serving of coffee. For extreme sweetness, use 1–1½ tbsp (15–22 mL).
The traditional ingredients are dark, Cuban-style roasted beans and raw demerara sugar.

, Do not tamp down the grounds, especially if your moka pot is aluminum. If you pack it too tightly, it can block the steam and cause uneven extraction, or even blow the lid off your pot., Pour water into the base of your moka pot, using preheated water for best results. Pour to the base of the safety valve.

, Screw together the parts of your moka pot and heat over medium-low. You'll know your coffee is ready when the moka pot gurgles.

Drizzle with chocolate syrup.",How to Make Coffee Soda," Keep in mind that you’ll need to make your cold brew coffee the day before you want to make your coffee soda, because it needs to sit overnight. Add the grounds to your large container, and then pour the water in over them. Stir your mixture, and then pop it in the fridge.The quality of water can make a difference. If you prefer filtered water over tap water, make sure to use it for your cold brew coffee.;
, The water and grounds need to brew for at least 12 hours, so it’s probably easiest to do it overnight.You can certainly make it in the morning if you want to enjoy your coffee soda as an evening treat. It’s crucial to let it sit this long so that the coffee is strong enough to not be overpowered by the soda and ice.

, Before you can drink your coffee, you’ll need to strain out the grounds. You can do this a few different ways. Of course, you can strain it through a coffee filter, but you can also strain it through several layers of cheesecloth.Pour it through your filter into another container, like a large jar, bottle, or pitcher. Take your time with this step to ensure that you don’t have a grainy drink!


You will have five cups of cold brew coffee, so you can make multiple coffee sodas.

, The amount of ice you use is personal preference. Remember that the more ice you use, the more your coffee soda may get watered down, if you drink it somewhere warm! You can use regular ice cubes or crushed ice in your drink.


If you’re worried about ice watering down your drink, consider making coffee ice cubes.

, Fill your glass up about half way with coffee, leaving room for the quarter cup (60 mL) of club soda. You can certainly fiddle around with the ratio of coffee to soda depending on your taste preferences.


If you typically add sugar to your coffee, you can add it now.

, Pour in 1/4 cup (60 mL) of club soda. Using a spoon or a stirring rod, mix your soda and coffee thoroughly. Take a sip! Add more coffee or more soda, as needed. You can also add a bit of sugar if you’d like your drink to be sweeter.

, This step is optional, but is a great one for anyone who needs some extra caffeine. You can learn how to make espresso with a machine here. Add one or two shots of espresso to your drink, and stir well. This will change the taste of your drink, so add more cold brew coffee or soda if needed., This is a decadent extra step that is great if you want to serve your coffee soda as a dessert. Use an ice cream scoop to get a rounded ball of ice cream. Gently place it on top of your drink. This will be easiest if you’ve added a fair amount of ice.As the ice cream melts, it will taste like a sweet cream in your coffee.

, Because why not? Add a little bit of chocolate to your drink to make it even more decadent and beautiful looking. Adding sweet toppings to your coffee soda will transform it from a simple beverage to an indulgent dessert."

Remove the percolator from the fire and serve.",How to Make Coffee Using a Percolating Coffee Pot over a Campfire," Gather the wood you’ll be using for the fire and stack or bundle it together. The simplest way to build a campfire is to use the ""teepee"" method, standing multiple smaller sticks upright and leaning them together so that they meet at the top. Scatter your tinder (fire-starting materials that are easily ignited, such as dry grass, bark or cotton balls) in the center of the teepee around the base. Leave a small space in the center for oxygen to flow through. Dry wood chopped or broken into small sections will burn best.
It isn’t necessary to build a large fire. 3 or 4 decent sized logs (along with plenty of kindling) should be enough to heat the percolator.;
, Ignite the tinder at the base of the wood. Blow gently on the flame from the burning tinder until the larger sticks catch. Keep the flames stoked by adding bits of kindling (smaller twigs, leaves and other dry brush) periodically. As the fire grows hotter, you can begin piling on more wood.Construct your fire somewhere with adequate coverage, protected from wind and precipitation. It may help to dig a shallow pit in which to place the firewood.Avoid putting wet wood or fresh foliage into the fire. These things don't burn easily, and will often produce thick, choking smoke.

, Allow the fire to die down until it’s reduced to glowing wood coals. Brewing coffee with a percolator will be easiest when the fire has died down a bit and the percolator can rest directly on the hot coals.Coals put off a lot of heat without flames, and are therefore easier to cook with than an open fire.If you don’t feel like waiting, you can use a fresh fire. Just set the percolator down low next to the base, or hang it directly over the flames if you’re able., You can also build a small coal fire, which will provide constant, controlled heat to boil the water in the percolator. Dig a shallow pit, ring it with large stones and scatter a couple handfuls of coal inside. Light the coals and let the temperature build until they’re glowing.Coal is convenient when it comes to this type of preparation, but may be less practical to pack and transport.
Cooking with bagged charcoal can be made easier with the use of a campfire cooking stove, dutch oven or similar implement., Make some space near the center of the coals to place the percolator as it brews. You can also set the percolator off to one side of the heat source if the flames are still raging or you’ve got other items cooking, though it may take a while for the percolator to get hot enough to brew the coffee with indirect heat. Rotating it partway through the heating process can help speed things along.Be sure to construct the fire on level terrain so that the percolator has a flat surface to rest on.
Keep all other gear and supplies away from both the fire and percolator.

, Open the percolator and remove the brewing basket. Fill the inner chamber with water. Use around 6-8 ounces for every cup of coffee you plan to make. If you’re brewing a full pot, stop filling the percolator just below the upper portion where the basket goes. On newer percolator models, this will usually be indicated inside with a line.Overfilling can saturate the coffee grounds, or cause the percolator to leak or burst under the pressure of heat.
If you’re not camping near a clean water source, remember to bring along a few jugs so that you can have coffee in the morning.

, Scoop your coffee of choice into the brewing basket. Add about one heaping tablespoon per cup if you like it strong; use slightly less for milder coffee. If the basket of the percolator you’re using has a separate cover, put it on once have the desired amount of coffee inside.The best consistency for coffee made over a campfire is a coarse grind (the bigger, rougher pieces makes it less likely that acids and other unappetizing compounds in the beans will begin to seep out once the temperature nears boiling). A finely ground coffee will also work, as long as you monitor its progress closely.Never use instant coffee in a percolator.

, Insert the basket into the upper area of the percolator. Make sure it fits properly in place. The brewing basket should slide in around the inner tube construction of the percolator which circulates the heated water.The bottom of the brewing basket is perforated to allow the hot water to cycle through the grounds.

, Put the lid on the percolator. Push, twist or latch it to make sure it won’t come loose—every model will be a little different. The coffee and water are now ready inside and the percolator is ready to be placed on the fire.

Ensuring that the lid is on snugly is important in case the percolator gets turned over.

, Lower the percolator onto the heat source. If the fire is burning low and there’s enough room, nestle it directly in the center. If the flames are still active, set the percolator close by near the base. Most coffee percolators are made from heavy duty steel, which means you can expose them to an open flame without having to worry about damaging them.

Be cautious when setting the percolator on the fire. Even old coals may be extremely hot.
Make sure the percolator is in a safe place for you to retrieve it when it’s finished brewing.

, Leave the percolator to absorb the heat of the fire. As the temperature inside rises, the water will be pulled up through the center tube, splashing over the coffee in the brew basket and filtering back down into the lower chamber. Through this process, the water will extract the natural essences of the grounds and the result will be fresh, delicious coffee.Don’t let the water in the percolator come to a boil, if you can help it. Most connoisseurs agree that boiling coffee strips it of its subtle tones and leaves it bitter and burnt-tasting.Making coffee over the campfire can take anywhere from 5-10 minutes, depending on the temperature of the heat source and the quantity of coffee being brewed., Watch the percolator closely as it heats. Most percolators have a transparent dome window in the lid that will help you judge when the coffee is sufficiently brewed. The secret to making good campfire coffee is to keep the temperature steady and take the percolator off the fire when it’s reached its peak flavor.Take note of the coffee’s color. If it is pale, it probably hasn’t had enough time to brew. If it’s nearly black, or looks thick and oozing, it may have become overheated. Aim for the color and consistency you ordinarily prefer your coffee to be.
For best results, remove the percolator from the heat source and let the coffee simmer for 5 minutes before pronouncing it done., When the coffee turns a rich dark color and begins to bubble against the dome, it’s ready to serve. Take the percolator off the fire very carefully using tongs or heat-resistant gloves. Let the coffee cool slightly before pouring. Fill your mug, stir in some cream or sugar (if you have it) and savor to the last drop!Keep your gloves on while serving the coffee. Due to its predominately metal construction, the percolator will stay hot for a while, even after it’s been removed from the fire.

There are also reusable gold filters available for many coffee makers. These cut down on paper waste, add no flavor at all to the brew, and are easily cleaned.

Understand how a moka pot works.,
Preheat enough water for the bottom moka pot chamber in a separate kettle or pot.,
Fill the bottom chamber of the moka pot with the water, almost to the valve ring.,
Fill the basket with coffee, leveling the coffee off with your fingers.,
Screw the top and bottom of the moka pot together.,
Place the moka pot on the stove over moderate heat, leaving the top lid open.,
Wrap the pot with a cold dish towel or run it under cold tap water.,
Pour your finished brew into cups or a carafe.",How to Make Coffee on a Stove2," It is an Italian-designed metal vessel that disassembles into three parts, and uses steam pressure to brew coffee. Check Step 1 here for a good diagram and the following description of a moka pot:


They have three chambers, one for water, one for grounds and one for the finished product.
The bottom chamber is for the water. It usually has a pressure valve as well.
The middle chamber is for your finely ground coffee. Pack it in lightly.
The top chamber is the collection point for the brewed espresso / coffee.

, When the water boils, remove it from the heat source. This step is not required but is recommended to prevent the metal moka pot from overheating and imparting a metallic taste.

, There may be a guide line inside the chamber. Insert the filter basket.








, Make sure there are no loose coffee grounds on the top edge of the filter basket that might hinder the seal.









Use standard drip grind coffee -- roughly table salt consistency.

, Make sure they are securely sealed, but do not tighten so much that you won’t be able to get them back apart.









Be careful so as to not spill the ground coffee into the water or either into the top chamber. Keep each in its own place for now.

, When steam begins to form, the coffee will start to percolate up into the top chamber. You will hear a puffing sound as the steam emerges.









The coffee will emerge as a rich brown stream which will lighten over time. Wait for the stream to reach the color of yellow honey, then remove the pot from the heat.
Do not leave the pot on too long or you will scorch the coffee -- and that is not a taste most people enjoy.

, Again, this is not absolutely necessary, but is recommended to prevent the coffee from acquiring a metallic taste.

, If this semi-espresso is too strong for your liking, you can dilute it with water.

Gather your materials.,
Add sugar to the ibrik.,
Fill the ibrik with water until it reaches the neck.,
Add coffee to the water, but do not stir the coffee at this time.,
Heat the ibrik on the stove.,
Remove it from the heat when the foaming reaches the top of the ibrik.,
Pour the coffee into demitasse cups.",How to Make Coffee on a Stove3," A regular old pot and drip grind coffee will not do for this method.


You’ll need an ibrik (variously known as a cezve, briki, mbiki or toorka, among other names), a small metal pot (traditionally made of brass) which is thinner at the neck than base and usually has a long handle.
You’ll also need water and sugar (or, though less traditional, a sugar substitute), of course.
This method requires Turkish grind coffee, which is as fine a grind as you are likely to encounter. Specialty shops, coffee roasters, Middle Eastern shops, and some mainstream retailers may have this grind.
Also look at the grinding machine found in your grocery store’s coffee aisle -- many of them actually have a Turkish grind setting.If grinding your own beans, make the grind as fine as you can.

, This is optional but traditional. Add to taste, but 2 teaspoons for an 8 ounce ibrik is probably a good reference point.









You can substitute an artificial sweetener (such as aspartame) for the sugar as well.

, Do not overfill -- leave some room in the neck for frothing or you will end up with a giant mess on your stove.









If you want to make less coffee, you need a smaller ibrik. It needs to be filled to the lower neck to brew properly. A typical small ibrik is about 8 ounces, enough for two 3 oz. demitasse cups.

, Allow the coffee grounds to float on the top of the water.









These floating grounds act as a barrier between the water and air, facilitating the frothing process.
Depending on how strong you like your coffee, use one to two rounded teaspoons of coffee per demitasse serving, or roughly three rounded teaspoons (or one rounded tablespoon) for an 8 oz. ibrik.

, Some people recommend using a low setting, but medium to high heat will also work. You’ll just have to pay even closer attention to prevent a messy boil-over.









The coffee will foam. Foaming is not the same as boiling.Do not let it boil, and really do not let it boil over unless you love vigorously scrubbing a scorched stovetop.

, Let it settle back down, then -- finally -- you can stir it.









Traditionally this process is repeated up to three more times. Put the ibrik back on the heat, wait for it to froth up to the top of the neck, then let it settle down and stir.

, Let it rest for 1-2 minutes before drinking to let the grounds settle.









When pouring, leave the last bit of coffee in the ibrik to trap some of the “sludge.” Likewise, when drinking, leave the last bit in your cup.
Turkish coffee is traditionally served with a glass of water as a palate cleanser.

Gather your ingredients.,
Grind your coffee.,
Add ground coffee to the carafe.,
Bring the water just to a boil.,
Start a timer.,
Put a lid on it.,
Press!,
Pour and enjoy.",How to Make Coffee2," You will need a French press (aka press pot), coarse ground coffee, a wooden or plastic spoon, a timer, and cups.

, For a French press, aim for a coarse grind for even flavor extraction and a fuller-bodied cup of coffee. If you are shopping for a coffee grinder, burr grinders are much preferred over blade grinders for their more consistent grind and the fact they do not create heat to burn the beans further., Put the grounds directly into a clean, dry carafe. A good rule of thumb is one tablespoon of grounds for every cup of water. A 4-cup press, then, would get 4 tablespoons of coffee., Pour it into the carafe, moving the stream around to saturate all the coffee, until it's about an inch under the top metal ring.

Leaving room at the top allows the grounds to expand, or bloom, and form crema, that foamy topping you usually see on espresso.

, The key to a great cup of coffee from a French press is timing. Set your timer for 4 minutes, and when you are done with the previous step, start your timer.

At the 1-minute mark, stir the grounds to break down the bloom and distribute the grounds evenly. Top off the carafe with near-boiling water, filling it to the top of the top metal ring. Avoid using a metal spoon, which could lead to accidental breakage. Instead, use a wooden or plastic spoon or stir-stick. Lacquered chopsticks work well for this, too.

, Place the vented lid and press assembly onto the carafe, making sure the vented portion of the top is aligned with the lip of the carafe., At the 4-minute bell, gently but firmly press the plunger down to the bottom. This will filter out the grounds, and stop the brewing process.

Note: should you forget to stir at the 1 minute mark, you may find this step difficult. Do not force the plunger down, simply pull it back up a bit, then repeat, working your way down. Forcing it could result in breakage, which could result in a real mess—and you will not have even had your first cup of coffee for the day!

, Pour what you can into your cup, and pour the rest into a thermal carafe to keep it hot and tasty. Add cream, sugar, and flavorings to taste."

Pour hot water through the filter to remove any paper flavor, and preheat the carafe. Let the water drain completely, then pour it out. Keep the filter sealed against the walls of the cone.

, Pour 6 tablespoons of the medium-ground coffee into the filter., Bring the water just to a boil, and pour only just enough into the filter to saturate the grounds. Move the stream of water around to saturate all the grounds evenly, but avoid pouring too much—you want very little water actually dripping through on the first pour. Let bloom for about 30 seconds., Pour water around the cone, breaking down the bloom and saturating all the grounds evenly. Fill the cone till the water's about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the top, and let the water filter through the coffee, into the carafe., When you see about an inch of grounds clinging to the sides of the filter, fill the cone again, pouring around the sides to wash off the dry grounds back into the mix, and fill to the top of the cone., When the water has filtered through, remove the filter and put it where it can finish draining without making a mess., Serve your coffee, creamed and sweetened and flavored to your tastes.

Drink up!",How to Make Coffee5," Espresso is a slightly different beast than your standard drip or filtered preparation methods. It not only requires a specialty machine, it also requires a particular type of coffee blends, grind, and experience with packing the basket correctly. While it's more complex (and will likely result in a few less-than-delicious cups of coffee at first), once you get the hang of it you may never visit that mermaid place again!

, You will need an espresso maker with a clean basket and filter, a grinder, a brewing cup, and the proper cup for your finished brew., Shocking the freshly-brewed espresso with a cold cup will not do your coffee flavor any favor. You may also wish to preheat your serving cup at this time, too., Set your grinder to fine, and if possible, grind directly into the filter and basket. Fill so that it is rounded above the basket., Use your finger back and forth in all ways using a sweeping motion to fill the basket-be sure not to lose any espresso and to stay even. Never use your tamper to ""fill the empty spaces"" because this is a good way to crack your porticup (this is what the basket is called)!, Place your PortaCup at the edge of the counter so the spout is not on the counter. This is to prevent the spout from breaking off. Using your tamper, apply even, firm pressure on the grounds. Keep your tamper flat so that all the grounds are evenly pressed so that the extraction doesn't have any ""hot spots"" where the coffee is packed looser than other parts., Firmly attach the filter onto the head, and start the machine., It will come out of the spout in one or two thin, creamy tails, and not spurt out. After about 26 to 33 seconds, remove your cup of espresso, and taste it. It may be very bitter, but the end goal is to have the thought ""I can have another sip.""

Make notes when you first get started, so that you can adjust your grind to make the perfect cup every time. If it comes out fast and is too thin, make the grind finer. If it's too thick and takes too long to come out, make the grind coarser next time.

, Either drink it straight, or with a cube of brown sugar, or however you like your espresso. Here are some quick drink guides:

Cappuccino: A single or double shot of espresso topped with one part steamed milk and one part milk foam.
Latte: A single or double shot of espresso with steamed milk and a thin layer of foam.
Cafe Americano: One or two shots of espresso in a coffee cup, topped off with hot water.
Cortado or Gibraltar: A single shot of espresso with 4 ounces of steamed milk (think ""mini-latte"")

Add sugar or honey and enjoy.",How to Make Milk Tea1," Add the water to a tea kettle and heat it on the stove over medium to medium-high heat until it reaches a boil.


Many tea kettles will whistle when done, but some do not, so you may need to be vigilant.
You could also use a small saucepan or electric hot pot to boil the water.
Note that you can boil water in the microwave, but you should boil the water in short 1 to 2 minute intervals to avoid superheating it. You should also make sure that a wooden chopstick or other microwave-safe object is placed in the water as you heat it.;
, Measure out your loose tea leaves into a teapot and pour the boiling water over.


For this type of tea, oolong tea tends to be the favored variety. You could also use green tea or black tea, but white tea tends to be too delicate.
For a non-traditional yet appealing taste, you could also try an herbal tea blend. Floral teas, like rose tea, are especially suitable. For an herbal tea, you should add about 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of loose-leaf tea. If you prefer a stronger tasting tea, add more leaves rather than steeping the tea for a longer period of time.
If you do not have a teapot, you could add the leaves directly to a saucepan of boiling water. Turn the heat off when you add the tea leaves to the water, though.

, Cover the teapot and let the tea leaves steep for 1 to 5 minutes.


Green tea should be steeped for roughly 1 minute, while black tea can be steeped for 2 to 3 minutes. Steeping these types of teas for a longer period of time can result in a bitter taste.Oolong tea should steep for 3 minutes ideally, but it responds better to being over-steeped and will not take on the same bitter taste that green tea or black tea will develop.
Herbal tea will need to steep for 5 to 6 minutes and will not turn bitter if left unattended for slightly longer.

, Add the milk to the tea as it steeps, stirring gently after each addition.


Do not add the milk all at once. Doing so will cause the tea to become watery.
If possible, avoid letting the milk reach temperatures above 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.6 degrees Celsius). When milk heats for too long, the denaturation of protein causes it to develop an odor.

, Pour the tea through a tea strainer and into your serving cup.


If you do not have a tea strainer, a sifter or any fine mesh strainer will work just as well. Some form of strainer is necessary, though, to prevent the tea leaves from entering your cup.

, Stir the sweetener of your choice into your tea to sweeten it to your liking. Enjoy the tea while it still remains hot.

, Measure out 2 tsp (10 ml) of dried parsley leaves. Place the leaves in the bottom of a teacup, pour the boiling water on top, and steep the leaves for 5 to 10 minutes.


Parsley tea can have a bitter taste. Steep it for 5 minutes if you're sensitive to bitterness. If you enjoy strong teas or plan to sweeten it, steep the parsley for up to 10 minutes.

, Pass the contents of the teacup through a tea strainer. Collect the liquid tea in a second teacup placed beneath the strainer and discard the caught parsley leaves.

, Sweeten the tea, if desired it, or drink the parsley tea without any sweetener. Either way, you should enjoy it while it's still hot.

, Rinse the parsley root under cool, running water, then use a sharp kitchen knife to roughly chop 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of parsley root.


While you can technically use the roots of leaf parsley, it's more common to use Hamburg root parsley, a separate cultivar with a much thicker root that resembles a white carrot.
If the parsley root appears dirty, rinse it under cool, running water and scrub away as much dirt as possible. You can also peel the root, but doing so isn't usually necessary.

, Place the chopped parsley root in the bottom of one teacup. Pour the water into the same cup, then steep the tea for about 10 minutes.


The taste of parsley root tea is somewhat milder when compared to parsley leaf tea, so it's usually best to wait the full 10 minutes to allow the flavor to develop. You can adjust this time to your personal tastes, however.

, Pour the contents of the teacup through a fine mesh strainer, catching the pieces of chopped parsley root inside. Collect the liquid tea in a separate teacup.

, Drink the parsley root tea immediately. You can serve it sweetened or unsweetened.

, Measure out 2 tsp (10 ml) of parsley seeds into the bottom of a teacup. Pour the boiling water over the seeds, then allow the tea to steep for about 5 minutes.


Parsley seeds can be slightly more bitter than parsley leaves, so the steep time is usually restricted to 5 minutes. You can increase this time if you prefer very strong tea, however.

, Pass the concoction through a fine mesh tea strainer, collecting the seeds in the strainer as you do. Allow the liquid tea to drip into a second teacup placed beneath the strainer.

, To enjoy the best flavor, drink the parsley seed tea while it's fresh and hot. You can sweeten it or leave it unsweetened.


While you can use any standard sweetener, using raw sugar or local honey may offer more health benefits than many other sweeteners can.

Most tea kettle whistle once your water is ready, but if yours does not, you will need to monitor it visually.
If you do not have a tea kettle, you could use a small saucepan or electric hot pot to boil the water, instead.
You could also boil water using your microwave, but there are a few precautions you should take to minimize the risk of superheating the water. Place a non-metallic object, like a set of wooden chopsticks, in the water as it heats, and only use a microwave-safe dish. Heat the water in short intervals, no longer than 1 or 2 minutes in length.

, After situating the bags in the mug, pour the boiling water over them.


Black tea works best for iced milk tea prepared in this method, but oolong tea would also work well. Regardless of the tea you choose, it should be fairly strong.
If using black tea leaves, place them in a mesh tea ball or clean nylon sock to form a ""bag"" of sorts. Use 2 to 4 tsp (10 to 20 ml) of loose-leaf tea for this method.

, The tea should steep for about 2 minutes, unless the directions on your brand of tea specifically state otherwise.


Since this will be an iced tea, you do not need to worry about the loss of heat caused by keeping the tea exposed as it steeps.

, Remove the tea bags and pour the condensed milk in. Stir until well-incorporated.


You can vary the amount of condensed milk based on your own individual tastes.
Note that condensed milk is fairly sweet, so you will not need to add sugar or another sweetener after adding the milk.

, Fill a tall glass with ice cubes or crushed ice until it is at least half full.


While filling the glass to the top with ice will cause the tea to be diluted and watery, adding too little ice will not allow the tea to cool down fast enough. The glass should be about 1/2 to 3/4 full.

, Pour the milk tea from the mug you steeped it in and into your glass of ice. Enjoy immediately.

, Bubble tea is a special type of milk tea that has chewy tapioca pearls, or boba, mixed in. The tea is sweetened usually made with cream.



Try almond milk tea for something different. Almond milk tea is a specific type of bubble tea, so it has tapioca pearls mixed into it. This tea also uses homemade almond milk, but store-bought almond milk would make a suitable alternative.

, Masala chai is a drink that originated in India and Pakistan, and it can be prepared with black tea, milk, honey, vanilla, cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom seeds. The tea can be enjoyed hot or cold.

Know that the fork is on the left side of the plate and the knife is on the right.,

Hold your fork in your left hand.,
Bend the wrists, so that your index fingers are pointing down towards your plate.,
Hold the food down with the fork by applying pressure through the index finger.,
Bring smallish bits of food to your mouth with the fork.,

Only when cutting, place the knife in your right hand.,

Now switch hands.,

When you're finished eating, place your silverware in a completed position.,
Get crafty with rice and other small items.,
To eat pasta, twirl it with your fork.",How to Use a Fork and Knife," If you have more than one fork, the outer one is your salad fork and the inner one is for your main dish. The fork for your main dish will be larger than your salad fork.


We'll cover table settings in the last section. For right now, let's concentrate on how to hold your utensils and get to eating! The ""right"" way, of course.;
, The index finger is mostly straight and rests near the base of the top, blunt side of the blade. The other four fingers wrap around the handle. While your index finger is resting on the top, your thumb juxtaposes it on the side. The end of the knife handle should be touching the base of your palm.


This is the same in both styles. And both styles cater to right-handers. If you're left-handed, consider reversing pretty much anything you read on this topic.

, The tines (prongs) face away (downward) from you. The index finger is straight, and rests on the back-side near the head of the fork, but not so close you are in danger of touching the food. The other four fingers wrap around the handle.


This is often referred to as the ""hidden handle"" method. This is because your hand is pretty much covering the entirety of the handle, secluding it from view.

, This makes the tip of the knife and fork also point towards the plate somewhat. Your elbows should be relaxed and not at all up in the air or uncomfortable.


While we're at it, typically your elbows should be off the table at all times. But if you're taking a break from using your cutlery and in an informal setting, don't stress about it.

, If you're cutting, place the knife close to the base of the fork and cut with a sawing motion. Foods like pasta will only require a swift, easy cut, while chewy meats will take a bit of work. Generally, only cut one or two bites at a time.


Hold the fork so the tines (prongs) are curving toward you, with the knife further away from you than the fork. At an angle is fine, too -- just make sure you can see your knife clearly to know where you're cutting. You should be able to look over your fork to your knife.

, In this style of eating, bring the fork to your mouth with the tines curving downward. The back of the fork will be up as you bring it to your mouth.


Keep the fork in your left hand, even if you're right-handed. You may find that this method is the more efficient of the two if you experiment with both.

, Unlike the Continental method, the American style of using a fork adopts more of a pen-like hold. The handle rests against your hand in between your thumb and forefinger, your middle finger and thumb are holding the base, and your index finger rests on top. Again, the tines are downward, curving away from you.

, This hand positioning is the same as in the aforementioned style -- with your index finger along the base and your other fingers wrapped around it.

, Hold the food down with your fork (tines down), cutting through with the knife in a gentle sawing motion. Your fork should be closer to you than your knife. Only cut one or two bites before continuing.

, Here comes the main difference between the two styles: after cutting a bite, put your knife down on the edge of your plate (blade at 12 o'clock, handle at 3 o'clock) and transfer your fork from your left hand to your right. Turn it so the tines are curving upward and take a bite! Tada.


This is the method that was prevalent when America first became America. Europe used to use it, but has since moved on, favoring a more efficient approach. The jump hasn't quite made it across the pond, though there are pockets of difference everywhere.

, If you are eating a dish that doesn't require cutting, keep your fork in your right hand at all times with this method. Tines can face downward if you're taking a bite, but will generally return upward for the majority of the time. However, do know that only in the absolute most formal of settings will this ever be an issue. We're talking when the President is sitting across from you. Other than that, don't stress.


Your silverware should never touch the table. If you're only using your fork, be sure your knife is resting along the edge of your plate. When you put your fork down, rest the handle on the edge, tines near the center of the plate.

, For 95% of meals, you'll probably just be dealing with a knife, fork and spoon. But for those fancy occasions, you may see a few more pieces and wonder what the heck you should be doing. Here's a rough outline:


A four-piece setting is a knife, a salad fork, a place fork (main dish), a place knife, and a teaspoon for coffee. The salad fork will be on the outside and smaller than your place fork.
A five-piece setting is all that and a soup spoon. The soup spoon will be much larger than your coffee teaspoon.
A six-piece setting is a first-course fork and knife (on the outside), main course fork and knife, and a dessert/salad fork and coffee teaspoon. Those last two will be the small ones.
A seven-piece setting is all that and a soup spoon. The soup spoon will be much larger than your coffee teaspoon and isn't a knife or a fork.

If you ever see a small fork on your right (forks generally never go on the right), it's an oyster fork.
Utensils are generally placed in the order of their use. When in doubt, start from the outside and work your way in.



, There are two different ways to signify to your waiter that you aren't finished:


European style: Cross your knife and fork on your plate, fork over knife, tines facing down. The two should form an upside-down ""V.""
American style: The knife goes near the top of your plate, blade at 12 o'clock, handle at 3 o'clock. The fork is placed tines upward, just at a slight angle from your body.

, This lets your waiter know your plate can be cleared (if he's in the know, that is). Again, the two schools of thought are:


European style: Knife and fork parallel to each other, handles at 5 o'clock, blade and tines in the center of your plate (tines downward).
American style: The same as European style, only the tines of the fork are facing upward.

, You will need to pick them up by the fork in a slight scooping manner, rather than stabbing at them fruitlessly. The American style generally prefers to rely solely on the fork (again, less efficient), while the European style sometimes employs the help of the knife blade or a piece of bread for scooping.

, If you have a spoon, ensnare a few noodles with your fork and twirl them, resting on the base of your spoon. If the noodles are too long and are proving cumbersome, you can cut them with your knife if need be. But before you take any drastic measures, just try taking only a few noodles at a time. And make sure you have a napkin at the ready!


If you're not good with pasta, you are in good company. It's messy for even the most seasoned of pasta-eaters at times. It's less about the knife and fork and more about not slurping!

Know what you want before you approach the register.,
Be specific with your order.,
Tell the cashier what size drink you'd like.",How to Order Coffee at Mcdonald's2," McDonald's restaurants are typically very busy, so don't hold up the line by being indecisive. If you know that you are going to take awhile to decide, stand off the side to look at the menu. Once you know what you want, you can get in line and approach the register.

, When your order your drink, be as specific as possible. Always use the proper name for the item you are ordering, and specify exactly how you want it. If you do not specify, you will receive your drink how it is traditionally made. For example, the default milk used at McDonald's is whole milk, and the default temperature for most drinks is hot. If you do not specify that you do not want those things, that is what you will get.


If you order a coffee, specify how many creams and sugars you want.
If you want a flavor, explicitly say what flavor you want.
If you want a certain type of milk, tell the cashier.

, Like most of McDonald's products, all hot and cold coffee drinks come in small, medium, and large. If you do not specify what size drink you'd like, you may end up getting a size that you do not want.

It's a good idea to double check your order to make sure it is correct. This is especially important for more complicated orders, like milk substitutions and flavor additions.

, It's never a good idea to be rude to people who are preparing your drinks or food. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes, so be polite to the cashier if your order is incorrect. The more polite you are, the better and faster your drink will be prepared., Once you've gotten your correct drink, enjoy it! If you ordered a hot drink, let it cool before you drink it to avoid burning your tongue. If you ordered a cold beverage, drink it slowly to avoid getting a brain freeze.

, You put the numbers together like this: 19 is 10 + 9 so it is juu-kyuu (十九). 90 is 9 sets of 10 so it is kyuu-juu (九十). So 198 is hyaku-kyuu-juu-hachi (百九十八); a mouthful, but break it down and it makes a lot of sense the way the Japanese do it. 1198 is sen-hyaku-kyuu-juu-hachi (千百九十八).

, You can hail the staff by calling, ""Onegaishimasu"" (oh neh guy shee mas- meaning 'please') or ""Sumimasen"" (soo me masen- 'excuse me'). Many nicer restaurants also have a call button you can push to summon your waiter.

Order your drink.",How to Order at Starbucks," To get a drink you will enjoy, it is important ordering something based on what you are craving. Ordering at Starbucks does not necessarily mean that you must order coffee; in fact, there are dozens of drink choices including tea, smoothies, and hot chocolates. Consider the current outside temperature and season to decide what sounds just right.


If you are not sure what sounds good, do not be afraid to ask your barista for suggestions or help. They can give you choices based on your drink preferences to help make one that is tailored to you.
Remember to think about if you want the drink hot, iced, or blended, as well as the sweetness and caffeine.;
, Starbucks is known for having their name-specific sizing. Don’t fear, getting the sizes down is easy. A tall is the equivalent of 12oz, a grande is 16oz, and a venti is 20oz in hot and 26oz. in iced. Some Starbucks also offer a short drink equalling 8oz, or a Trenta, which is equal to 31oz.


A tall typically comes with a single shot of espresso, a grande comes with a double shot, and a venti also comes with a double shot, unless it is a venti iced drink, in which it comes with a triple shot of espresso.
If you want more espresso than the size you order comes with, simply ask for extra shots. These will cost more, but you will be able to get that perfect amount of espresso without having to size your entire drink up.

, It does not matter if you order coffee, tea, or any other drink - you always have the ability to add sugar or a syrup flavor. Adding a flavor will typically give you two extra pumps of syrup, so if you want your drink extra sweet be sure to specify and be ready to pay more. Sugar is free, but a syrup flavor is not.


If you’re uncertain what flavor you want to add, ask to see a flavor menu or ask the barista what popular flavors are available. There are dozens of flavor choices, so don’t feel like you are limited to simply “sugar” or “no sugar.”
Most of the popular syrup flavors like vanilla, caramel, and hazelnut all come with sugar-free options. If you are trying to be a bit healthier, order a sugar-free syrup flavor for your drink.
Ask about seasonal flavors when you order, as there are many specialty syrups that are available at different times of the year. In the fall and winter, pumpkin is available while in the summer coconut is often out in participating locations.

, Some drinks are made with milk while others are made with water as the base. If you prefer one over the other, specify that when you order. Typically, nonfat, 2% milk, soymilk, and half-and-half are the available milk options. Some Starbucks also carry speciality milks such as almond or coconut milk.


You can get any drink hot or iced, and many coffee drinks blended. If you change the form of your drink, you might also have to change the liquid base. For example, blended coffee must be made with a milk base instead of water to get the right consistency.
When milk is steamed, it creates a richly aerated foam. This is like warm whipped milk on the top of your drink. If you like foam, you can order your drink with extra, or if you don’t like it ask for your drink to go without.

, Espresso and coffee both naturally have caffeine, as do black and green teas. If you want less caffeine in your drink, order half-caf (1/2 the normal amount of caffeine) or decaf (with no caffeine). You can also add extra shots of coffee if you are looking for a bit more energy from your drink., This is just your basic drip coffee you might make at home, but prepared in many different flavors. Most Starbucks have multiple brews going during the day, so you can sample several different roasts and blends. Brewed coffee is the cheapest and easiest thing on the menu to order.

, Lattes are a basic espresso drink made out of steamed milk and espresso shots. Any flavor can be added to a latte, and any type of milk can be used. Lattes can be made hot or iced.

, These are one of the most popular drinks for coffee enthusiasts, as the espresso taste is very strong. Americanos are made with espresso and water only, and have one extra shot more than any other drink. Cream and sugar can be added just like with drip coffee, as well as any flavor you might like.

, These are similar to lattes because they are made solely of steamed milk and espresso, but cappuccinos are comprised mainly of foam. This means that your drink will be light and fluffy more than it is liquid. When you order a cappuccino, you must order it as “wet” (not so much foam) or “dry” (mostly foam). Add any flavors or sugar alterations you would like.

, Macchiato is the Italian word meaning, “marked.” It is used in this drink to describe the mark of espresso poured over the top, instead of being stirred into the drink. Caramel machinates are made with vanilla syrup, steamed milk and foam, espresso, and caramel drizzle.

, Mochas are lattes (milk and espresso) with the addition of chocolate. The two mocha variants are milk chocolate or white chocolate. The former is a bit richer while the latter is much sweeter. Mochas are typically made without any foam, so if you like the creamy milk ask for a little extra on top.

, If you are a real espresso lover, order it straight up! Ask for a single or double shot of espresso, and then add a modifier of choice. Often espresso shots are served macchiato style with a dollop of foam, or con panna with a bit of whipped cream.

, If you are not a coffee lover, try getting one of the many teas available. Most teas are made with hot water, but there are several latte teas made with milk. These include the ever-popular chai tea (spicy cinnamon flavored tea) and the London fog (a sweet vanilla and earl gray tea blend). You can order any tea to be made with milk or water, and hot or iced.

, Frappuccinos are blended drinks, typically made with coffee. Starbucks offers many specialty Frappuccinos, so ask your barista what ones are offered if you don’t see them on the menu. Some Frappuccinos, like the strawberries and cream, aren’t made with any coffee. These often come with whip and a drizzle of chocolate or caramel.

, If you are not interested in coffee or tea, don’t worry - there are several other non-coffee drinks available at Starbucks. For hot drinks you can get hot chocolate, a steamer (milk with a syrup flavor), or an apple cider. You can also do lemonade or different smoothies if you want something cold and coffee-free.

, Once you have decided on your coffee and all the possible variables, make your order. Start with the size of the drink, then the name, then any amendments you want to make. For example, order a “grande chai tea latte with extra foam.” Don’t be afraid to be specific!"

, Burritos and burrito bowls will also come with brown or white cilantro-lime rice, which you can decline if you choose. Brown rice is the healthier choice with a slightly thicker texture and a nuttier flavor than white rice.

, Black beans have slightly fewer calories in them than pinto beans, but other than that, there’s not much difference in nutritional value.

, Made with bell peppers, onions, and fresh oregano, the veggies add color and a wonderful flavor to your meal., You can ask for a little more or less protein if you feel like the 4 oz serving doesn't suit your tastes but keep in mind that you will be charged extra if you ask for a double serving of meat, and if you choose to get less than a serving, you'll get charged for the 4 ounces.


Braised pork carnitas, the CEO, Steve Ells' favorite and the least spicy meat.
Adobo-marinated grilled chicken, the second least spiciest meat and the most popular protein option.
Sofritas, Chipotle's vegan protein option. Made from poblano peppers and tofu, sofritas packs a punch.

Adobo-marinated steak. There is no spicier meat in the entire restaurant. Milder tastes beware!

, Customize your order by saying you want a lot or very little of these items. They have several kinds of salsa, so choose according to the amount of spice you like:


Fresh tomato salsa (mild)
Roasted chili-corn salsa (medium)
Tomatillo-green chili salsa (medium)
Tomatillo-red chili salsa (hot)

, Some Chipotle fans claim that if you order it on the side, you get substantially more, even though the amount should add up to 4 oz either way.

, You will get these items for free. You will choose these items when your order is half filled and a Chipotle employee is adding fresh ingredients to the top before they wrap it up.

, This is an extra charge with any order. Chips are around $1.27, while chips and guacamole are close to three dollars.

, There are two options. All kids meals have the choice of a small bag of chips or fruit on the side and organic milk or juice to drink.


A small cheese quesadilla with two sides. Chipotle workers may automatically add rice and beans as your side, but you have the choice to pick anything off the line. You may add meat or guacamole to the quesadilla for an extra charge.
A build your own kit. This comes with two soft or crispy taco shells, one meat, and any two ingredients of your choice.

Do your research on food trucks around the city.,
Arrive early.,
Order and pay for your food.,
Wait on the side.,
Allow them to call your name when the food is ready.",How to Order from Food Trucks," The number of them will vary from city to city, and each one of the trucks will have their own food cuisine or ""style"". Know that some to most food trucks reach out to the public through social networking sites, such as Twitter and Facebook. If you want to get the most out of food trucks for the first time, ask yourself a few questions:


What types of food do they offer/serve? Is it vegetarian/vegan friendly? Is it seafood or meat sandwiches? Do they offer drinks and/or side meals? Check out their website (if applicable) or other websites that offer reviews to see if anything fancies you.
Is it a specific mealtime, such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a combination?
What are their hours of operation? Are they open strictly between 11 am and 2 pm?
Where are they specifically located? You'll need to find out the street name, nearest intersection, etc of where they are parked.
Do they accept cash, credit/debit cards, or both?;
, Depending on the popularity of the truck, there are people that tend to dip out of work to wait. Have patience, as it might take the workers time to prep the food before opening. This also might be a good time to look at their menu, as they will post it on the outside of the truck.

, You will need to provide your name so that they can identify you when your food is ready.

, Unless the food is a ""ready made"" item, such as packaged food, you will need to wait until everything is fully made. The amount of waiting time also depends how long the line is (how many people are in front of you).

, Double check on the food order, especially if it's for a large group. Be sure that it's your order, since people with very common names, such as John or Linda, might be mixed up with someone else.

, You will receive burrito ingredients wrapped in a cheesy quesadilla.Order half the ingredients of a burrito with this option, and they might call it a “burritodilla,” because it’s flatter, like a quesadilla., For a small additional charge, you can get cheese, beans, meat and salsa on top of fresh tortilla chips., You can ask for extra rice or an extra tortilla for free. One “hack” includes ordering a burrito bowl and asking for a free tortilla. You can even get the tortilla draped inside of the bowl under all the toppings. It's the best of both worlds: the amount of food in the bowl and the soft, warmness of a burrito-sized tortilla.

, You can fit more food when it comes with a bowl. Ask for the free tortilla to make your own mini burrito., Order both black and pinto beans, or half one type of meat and half of another type of meat.

Get your money ready.,
Check your food.",How to Order a Meal at the McDonald's Drive Thru," While you wait in line or when you can see the big board with all the food choices on it, look for what you want. McDonald's has food from salads to cheeseburgers, so pre-preparation is a must. If you have passengers eating with you, ask them what they want and make a mental note of it.;
, While you're ordering, there will be an electronic sign with what you want on it and what your bill is. After you're done ordering, check it to make sure the staff isn't missing anything or that they haven't put too many food items on.

If they are missing something, tell them what they forgot or what they gave you too many of. For example, if you ordered two salads but only got one, say, ""Excuse me, but I actually ordered two salads."" You must do it at the electronic billboard, otherwise you may not get your second salad.







, After you move your car and are moving towards the first window, get your money ready. It not only makes the line faster, but it's easier for the staff and you.

, When they give you your food, check to make sure they put in everything you ordered. Just because it was on the electronic board doesn't mean it's in your bag. If they didn't give you everything, just say, ""Oops, you forgot one of my salads"". Then they will check, and give it to you.

Don't go when the place is busy; the emphasis on fries and other food is speed rather than quality.,
If they are busy, there is no need to ask for fresh fries, estimate how many people are in the drive through and how many are in the lobby.,
Know exactly what you want before you approach the register-clerk, and tell them this order.,
Make sure the cashier knows you asked for ""no onions"" before he pays out, otherwise it can turn into a complicated mess.,
If you're ordering a meal remember to state which drink you would like.",How to Improve your McDonald's Experience," You'll have to wait longer, too.;
, If it appears to be a large amount your food will be fresh. If you desperately need fresh fries that are hot enough to burn you mouth, request fresh fries. McDonald's is more than happy to accommodate. However ordering salt-less fries slows the entire process down considerably. When no salt fries are ordered the entire fry area has to be cleaned and wiped down to ensure you don't get salt on your fries.

, Be as specific as you can possibly be, mentioning numbers(if it's part of the numbers listed on the aboard in back of the clerk).

, You'll save both save time if you ask first.

State facts that concern you.,
Ask the waiter politely to repeat what they said.,
Suggest the waiter rephrase their statement.,
Demand the waiter’s undivided attention.,
Be an active listener.,
Observe your waiter’s behavior.,
Accept their apology if they give it.",How to Handle a Rude Waiter1," Say, ""I'm sorry, but this meat is uncooked."" Be polite and speak in an even tone. The best way to handle rudeness is to bite your tongue and respond in a calm, cool manner., If the waiter’s rudeness came out of something they said, they may have said something on impulse or made a mistake. It's less likely they will be rude a second time. Say, “excuse me, it sounds like you just said something under your breath. Would you mind repeating what you said?”

, Say, “I wasn’t sure what you meant by that last statement. Could you please try saying it a different way?” Let them know that you understand they are busy, but that you have concerns, too. Your waiter may lack proper communication skills or may have miscommunicated what they meant in that moment.

, If your waiter isn’t giving you their undivided attention, they may not be able to communicate effectively. Sometimes waiters are too busy to realize when you need something. Wave your hand to get their attention. Say ""excuse me, could I please have more mayonnaise?""


To truly communicate a message means both parties must participate. Listeners must actively refocus on what the talker is saying and speakers must watch to see if the listener is understanding., While you can’t choose how your waiter responds to you, you can choose how you respond to them. Choose to be a better listener. By listening to your waiter, you are doing your part to effectively communicate.

, If the waiter is rude to you because they hadn’t checked on you in over 10 minutes, observe them from afar. Look for how many tables they seem to be juggling. Note whether they are standing in the corner looking bored, or if they are they constantly on their feet the whole time. Step back, observe your surroundings, and put the situation into perspective.


If your waiter is visibly ignoring you, let them know that you haven’t been attended to. This should be enough to remind them that they haven't done their job properly. If they are a good waiter they will attempt to make it up to you.

, If the waiter said something they regret, they may realize what they did and apologize. It may be enough to have the person apologize so that you can both move forward.

Ask to see the manager.,
Contact the business owner or head of the company.,
Tip the restaurant the same.",How to Handle a Rude Waiter2," If the waiter continues to be rude to you, take the initiative by asking to speak to the manager. Ask your waiter, another waiter, or the hostess to please send the manager by your table.


You could also ask to be served by a different waiter. Tell them, “We’d appreciate it if you could have someone else cover our table. Our waiter is being unprofessional.”Once you inform the manager, you might even get a voucher for a free meal. Tip 15% on whatever the original check amount was., If you are still unhappy, contact someone with more company authority. Most companies are going to be very angry to hear that you were treated negatively and will want to make it up to you. If the waiter truly was rude, it may help you feel better to know that someone “higher up the ladder"" reprimanded them.


Only contact the business owner or head of the company if you truly feel that you were treated unfairly. Try to handle any miscommunications with the waiter or management first.

, Except in cases of a severely dangerous situation (fire/severe injury/insult) you should tip your waiter 15%, or the standard tipping amount for your area. Remember, your waiter may be having an off day. Waiters are given a small paycheck, and many times rely on tips as their main source of income.Many times waiters must share their tips with other waitstaff such as busboys, runners or other servers. Remember that you are taking away from their tips, too.It may not be customary to tip in all English-speaking countries, so tip only where appropriate.

Leave a review online.,
Research new restaurants before trying them.,
Allow yourself to move on.",How to Handle a Rude Waiter3," If you truly feel you were taken advantage of in the situation, consider leaving a review online on the restaurant’s Google or Yelp page. Say, “I went to this restaurant hoping to experience a lovely evening, but instead waited over an hour for cold food from a waiter who didn't even apologize."" Spreading the news of a rude occurrence is important for preventing other people from experiencing the same thing.


Explain in your review how you attempted to remedy the situation. For example, say “I asked the waiter to clarify what he said, but he continued to be rude.” This will help to convince readers that you were still treated unfairly despite your attempt to work with the waiter.
Understand that writing a bad restaurant review has its consequences. Many times these reviews become part of the restaurant's permanent reputation. People may lose their jobs if the story is bad enough.Follow a restaurant critic’s code of ethics. Many professional restaurant critics wait until they have visited a location multiple times before writing a review. The reviewer is then able to judge whether poor customer service is frequent at that particular restaurant. If you feel as though you truly had a negative experience that others need to hear before they spend their money, then go ahead with posting your review., Read reviews online on Google’s restaurant reviews before going to future restaurants. Ask friends and family what their opinion of the place is. You can also look up the restaurant on Facebook or on other social media sites to see read further reviews and comments.

, Take a deep breath and count to 10. Ask yourself ""Is it worth my time to get upset over this?"" If you’ve done everything you can do, it’s time to move on.


Experiencing rude people is a part of life. Choose to spread positivism instead!

It can usually be found in 3 flavors: plain, vanilla and chocolate. The plain variety can be sweetened or unsweetened. Manufacturers recommend shaking the container of almond milk prior to drinking it as there may be some settlement at the bottom. Almond milk, in any flavor, can also be added to coffee or tea, just like normal milk or cream.;

Talk with organic farmers.",How to Locate Organic Restaurants," Organic food is far more popular that it once was. As such, more and more organic restaurants are gradually opening. When a new restaurant opens, one of the most important things that restaurant does is to build a loyal customer base by drawing new customers in through advertisements. While older restaurants may not advertise as extensively, new organic restaurants are likely to place ads in a variety of locations.


Check your local newspaper or city magazine for organic restaurant ads. Aside from simple ads, these periodicals may occasionally have a food critic review a new organic restaurant, as well.
Keep an eye and ear out for news. An established organic restaurant may have commercials that broadcast on your local TV stations or on local radio. Newer restaurants may be covered by a local news crew on TV or radio, especially if the organic scene is relatively new to your area.;
, It may seem like a dated method, but searching through your yellow pages is still an effective, time-tested solution to find what you need to find. Organic restaurants may not have their own section in the phone book, but many of the restaurants listed under ""Health Food Restaurants"" use organic ingredients. Some restaurants may specifically use the term ""organic"" in their name or description. Searching for organic restaurants using the phone book may take a little additional research on your part, but you can find a list of potential restaurants to look into.


People in most cities still receive yellow pages on their front door step. If you do not get a phone book dropped off at your home, though, you could always search for one or use an online version., There are numerous online directories for organic food. Many are strictly dedicated to the listing of organic restaurants. Some provide information on restaurants that are both organic and vegan, while others list organic food suppliers as well as organic restaurants, and others still contain information about organic restaurants that use locally grown produce.Determine what you need and find the right directory for you.


Most organic restaurant locators are searchable databases, so you can type in your city or zip code, along with other parameters, and find exactly what you are looking for. Others are just lists, but these lists are still usually divided by location, making it easy to find an organic restaurant in your area.

, Most major Internet search engines will allow you to search for businesses in your area just as you would search for other information. For instance, if you live in the Miami area, you could try going to your favorite search engine and searching “organic restaurants near Miami, Florida” or “organic restaurants near 33101.” The first few hits will probably be for websites offering information about organic restaurants in your area, but further down the first page, you will likely see several organic restaurants listed. Depending on the search engine, you may even get a map of these restaurants at the side of the screen.

, If you have a smart phone, look for an app that will allow you to search for the information you need. There are many, many apps that allow you to search for restaurants, and several of these allow you to search for restaurants that specifically use organic ingredients. You can even find apps that will allow you to further narrow your results by setting other parameters, like whether or not you want vegetarian or kosher menus.

, Some websites allow you to search for restaurants in your city that not only serve organic food, but bring it directly to your door. This can be especially useful if you are unfamiliar with the area an organic restaurant is located in or if you are uncomfortable driving there.

, Sometimes, the best way to find anything is through simple word of mouth. Connect with other organic eaters by calling a local co-op, finding a club or organization geared toward organic lifestyles, or going to an organic grocery store and introducing yourself to the workers and other shoppers. It takes a little more work on your part and the results are not instantaneous, but by networking with others committed to the organic lifestyle, you can eventually build up a knowledge bank of organic restaurants, along with other organic stops.


Do not be afraid to branch out and connect with organic eaters through online communities, as well. Blogs, message boards, and e-mail groups are all fair game. While these people may not be able to tell you how to find organic restaurants where you live, they can tell you about restaurants where they live, which may come in handy if you ever need to visit the area.

, Many organic restaurants, especially smaller café-style restaurants, buy their ingredients from local organic farmers. If the farmers and the restaurants are on good terms, an organic farmer may be willing to tell you what restaurants he sells his produce to. After all, if the farmer’s client does good business, the client will need to buy more produce, leading to better profits for the farmer. You can connect with local organic farmers by going to farmers’ markets.

Prepare: Don't starve yourself in advance.,
Learn about the pricing of the restaurant.,
Start by getting a large glass of natural mineral water or fruit juice.,
Eat a small dish of soup or starters, ideally warm and not very salty.,
Eat the most expensive foods first, and avoid cheap fillers like bread and pasta as these fill you quickly not allowing you to get value for money.

,
Eat small portions of everything that looks appealing.,
Go to the toilet whenever you feel like it, don't save it for home (you might get surprised on your way if you have eaten a lot).,
Have some desserts when you feel quite full.,
If you feel completely full, but would still like to stay, fruit, especially fruit salad can be a good idea.",How to Exploit an All You Can Eat Restaurant," Many people think if you skip the meal before going to the all you can eat restaurant, you can eat more. This is not true. Have a light but complete meal in your regular time, otherwise your stomach will tighten and you will not enjoy the meal at all. Also, drink enough during the day, you will need a lot of water to digest all that food.;
, Can you eat unlimited for a fixed flat rate? Does this apply to everything, or only the buffet? Are drinks included? This can spare you some nasty surprises on the bill. Some restaurants have different rates for different days of the week and times of the day. If you are on a budget, find the best time.

, Slightly acidic fruit juices are the best. The gas in fizzy drinks escapes inside your stomach and you will feel full long before you have had a good meal. Sweet or alcoholic drinks also require more water to digest them so avoid them or drink more water to keep your balance. Refill as you go, never go thirsty! Iced water will facilitate the opening of the pylorus (the link between the stomach and the intestine) and thus help your digestion.

, Also, enjoy having a meal with friends, have a chat, don't focus fully on eating.

,, Don't experiment too much with food you have never eaten before (such as exotic seafood or fruit), they might cause an uncomfortable feeling. Balance meat with garnishes such as rice, vegetables or potatoes. French fries are great but they are usually very salty so you will again have to drink a lot. If you feel full, stop eating, and rest and drink. You will probably be able to resume eating a bit later.

, If you have to break a conversation, excuse yourself politely. It is important to free yourself from excess weight.

, They will help balance your blood sugar level and overcome drowsiness. A light coffee can also be a good idea at this point.

Chicory coffee is a New Orleans specialty, so you may need to order online if you aren't in the area., Learn how to identify it so that you don't dig up the wrong plant. Chicory is a perennial herbaceous plant that grows in gravel or weedy fields, often beside roadways, across most of Canada and the U.S. The flowers are light blue or lavender and slightly ruffled at the ends of their petals.Dig up the plant carefully to preserve the roots.


To prepare for coffee, wash the roots until all the dirt is off. Dry the whole root on a towel in the sun.
The chicory plant flowers from July to October. The flowers only open on sunny days. The roots, however, are best to pick between fall and spring.The leaves and root of the plant are the bits that most people eat. The flower itself is technically edible, but it has a bitter taste., The bits should be no longer than one inch each. Make sure that they are small enough that they will roast quickly, but not so small that they will burn through. You don't need to worry about peeling the root.

Serve and enjoy.",How to Make a Vanilla Frappuccino1," The sweet vanilla and dairy flavors in a frappuccino can overpower the coffee unless you use coffee that is quite strong. There are a few different ways to do this. See below:


One way is to simply brew a pot of extra-strong coffee. Brew a pot normally, then pour the coffee into the water tank and run it through the machine again using the same grounds. After, run a cycle of water (without any grounds) to clean the machine. See our article on using a coffee maker for help.
You can also make espresso, but you'll need an espresso machine for this. See our article on using one.
Finally, you can try buying liquid coffee concentrate at your local specialty grocery store.;
, Pour the coffee/espresso, milk, condensed milk, and vanilla into a good-quality blender. Make sure this is a blender that can handle ice.

, Add a generous amount of ice, filling the blender at least 3/4 of the way to the top (if you wish, you can go up to the rim). You'll be surprised how much ice you need. Once it's crushed, it does not take up very much space.


Adding more ice will give you a slushier, more solid drink. Adding less ice will give you something a little more liquid (like a milkshake). If you're in doubt, you can always err on the ""less"" side and add more if it's not thick enough.

, You want to blend the ice completely into tiny pieces. No solid chunks should remain. Depending on your blender, this can take anywhere from 10-30 seconds. When you're finished, you should have a uniformly smooth, icy, tan mixture.


You may want to use a utensil or stirring stick to feel for chunks in the blended mixture once you finish. Pulse the blender a few more times if you find any.

, Transfer to a cup. For the complete Starbucks experience, top with whipped cream and drink through a green straw.

, Add 2







, Turn the heat onto medium-high and begin warming the coffee and water until it comes to a boil. Then, turn down the heat and let it simmer for about five minutes.








Make sure that you stir the coffee occasionally.
If the coffee starts to boil over, then remove it from the heat right away.

, The coffee will be ready to use in about five minutes. When the coffee is ready, remove it from the heat and pour it through a fine sieve or a cheese cloth to strain out the coffee grounds.








Use a large mug or heat proof measuring cup to gather the liquid.

, Choose whole milk for a richer tasting café con leche, or go for skim milk for a lighter version. Or, if you are not a fan of dairy, then go for a milk alternative, such as coconut milk, soy milk, or almond milk.









Measure two cups of milk and pour it into the pot.If you are just making enough for two people, then only pour one cup of milk into the pot.

, Start heating the milk on medium until it comes to a low boil and then reduce it to low and let it simmer for a minute or two. Stir the milk occasionally to keep it from forming a skin.If you have a milk frother, then you can use it to make the milk foamy. Use the frother on the milk until it is twice its normal size., After the milk is warm, remove it from the heat and add the coffee to the pot. Stir the coffee and milk together to ensure that they are well-combined. Leave the cafe con leche in the pot so that you can add your sweetener.








If you do not want to sweeten your café con leche, then you can just divide it into mugs and serve. You will have enough for four cups.

, One easy way to sweeten your café con leche is to pour in about ½ cup of pre-sweetened creamer. This will sweeten your café con leche and give it a richer taste. You can even choose a sweetened creamer that is flavored, such as hazelnut, vanilla, or chocolate.








Measure out ½ cup (or ¼ cup for just two people) of sweetened creamer and add it to the pot. Use less if you do not want to be too sweet. Then stir the ingredients until well combined.
The creamer may cool the café con leche slightly, so you can heat it on low to medium heat for a few more minutes if you like.

, Adding sugar is another option. You can add as much sugar as you like to sweeten your coffee. Sweetening your café con leche this way will allow you to adjust the sweetness to your taste and it will also not add any more fat to the recipe.Try starting with just a couple of spoonfuls and stir them into the café con leche.Taste the café con leche and then add more sugar if desired.
You can also try using honey, agave syrup, maple syrup, or brown sugar for a slightly different kind of sweetness. Start with a couple of spoonfuls and then adjust as desired.

, If you do not want to add real sugar, but you like your café con leche a little on the sweet side, then you can also use a sugar alternative, such as stevia or Equal.


Choose a sugar alternative that you like and start by adding a small amount, such as ¼ teaspoon or one packet. Then, taste the café con leche and add more if desired.

Understand what an herbal tea is.,

Use a decoction when an herb is better simmered than steeped to extract their specific nutrients.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Decoction," An herbal tea does not have tannin or caffeine, but does have varying amounts of antioxidants depending on how the herb is processed.;
, In addition to the traditional recipe for brewing tea (1-cup boiling water poured over 1-t dried herb or 2-t fresh herb), you may also choose to make an infusion (which is stronger than a tea) or a decoction.


The decoction method is used for hard, woody substances (such as roots, bark, and stems) that have constituents that are water-soluble and non-volatile. (Red clover is an exception, because red clover flower decoction will extract more minerals that the infusion.)
Decoctions extract mainly mineral salts and bitter principles. Decoctions are intended for immediate use.
Store for a maximum of 72 hours in the refrigerator.

, The basic recipe for a decoction includes 1-pt water and 1-oz of herb or root.


Place the water into a pot made from non-reactive metal (such as stainless or enamel; do not use aluminum).






Cut or crush the herb or root and add it to the water in the pot. (Do not cut or crush the herb or root in advance, as vital constituents can be lost.)






Turn on the heat to medium. Simmer your decoction with the lid off until the volume of water is reduced by one-quarter (so, three-quarters of a pint remains).






Cool and strain. Store in the fridge for no more than 72 hours.






Take in divided doses according to use.







, For example, oatstraw contains silica, which requires simmering to be released into the water.


In addition, red clover blossoms must be simmered to extract their copper and iron, and dandelion roots should be simmered to prepare a pleasant, coffee-like beverage.

Combine the main ingredients.,
Optionally, add pectin.,
Stir until the sugar is dissolved.,
Serve cold.",How to Make a Vanilla Frappuccino2," Add the milk, coffee/espresso, and sugar to a pitcher or mixing bowl. Stir until uniform.


Here, as in the recipe above, you want to use strong coffee for the best flavor. See the section above for tips on getting the right kind of coffee for your frappuccino.

, Pectin is a natural chemical substance derived from fruits that's used for thickening (especially when canning).It's tasteless, so it won't affect the flavor of this recipe. However, it will give you a slightly thicker, more ""creamy"" drink.

, Continue to stir until you can't feel any solid sugar remaining in the liquid mixture. This should only take a few minutes.


If you're having trouble dissolving the sugar, try using dimple syrup instead. Simply heat equal parts water and sugar on the stove until you have a clear, sweet syrup which dissolves easily in drinks. See our article on making simple syrup for more information.

, Once all the ingredients are combined and the sugar is dissolved, transfer the container to the fridge and chill. Serve the drink on its own or on the rocks (over ice).

Add chocolate for a chocolate frappuccino.,
Add chocolate chips for a blended chip frappuccino.,
Add mint extract for minty goodness.,
Try substituting ice cream for ice.",How to Make a Vanilla Frappuccino3," Making this variation is easy — since vanilla and chocolate go together, you don't even have to leave the vanilla flavorings out (although you can if you want to). Simply pour chocolate syrup into the mixture along with the other liquid ingredients. For a blended frappuccino, add ice and blend as normal — otherwise, just mix and drink.


For a subtler chocolate taste, try adding cocoa powder instead.

, If you prefer your chocolate flavor in the form of tiny chocolate chips flecked throughout your drink, just add chocolate chips or small chunks of your preferred chocolate bar. Blend the drink as normal and enjoy. For even more chocolate flavor, pair this with the chocolate frappuccino recipe above.

, Replacing the vanilla extract in either recipe with mint extract gives you a deliciously refreshing mint drink, making it perfect for hot summer days. This variation goes well with blended chocolate chips — a little green food coloring will get you that delicious ""mint chocolate chip"" look.


Try adding to the presentation by garnishing with fresh mint leaves. You're sure to get compliments if you're entertaining guests.

, If you don't have the ice for a blended frappuccino (or your blender can't handle it), don't worry. You can get something that's very similar to a ""regular"" frappuccino by adding a few scoops of vanilla ice cream instead. The drink will be a little thicker, smoother, and richer, but the flavor is fairly similar. Some ""imitation"" recipes even deliberately call for vanilla ice cream instead of ice."

Some think that nettles taste bitter and unpleasant after they've flowered.Others claim that cystoliths (microscopic stones) in the adult plants can irritate the urinary tract. Both of these claims are disputed by some nettle harvesters, but most stick to the young plants.Some subspecies of nettle will flower in late fall.;
, Wear gloves, long sleeves, and long trousers to avoid the stinging hairs. Bring along a pair of scissors or garden clippers to make harvesting easier.


Many experienced foragers pick barehanded, but they often contradict each other when giving advice. This may be due to variation between subspecies of nettles. The key is to look closely at the plant and figure out where the hairs are. They're usually angled the same way, so you can avoid most stings if you move along the plant from the opposite direction, or pinch the leaves from straight above and below.

, Nettles are common weeds throughout much of the world, and they should be easy to find in partial shade, such as a fence line or forest edge. The plants are dark green, with leaves growing in pairs opposite each other. The leaves are heart- or lance-shaped, with a toothed ridge around the perimeter.There are other, less common edible plants called ""nettles"" because they cause a similar sting. These may have a different appearance., The shoots are edible, but there's no reason to put them in tea. Check the top bud and leaves for holes or black specks, which are signs of pests.If they're healthy, clip them off and toss them in your bag. Grab the stem and run your gloved hand upward to remove all the leaves at once.


To keep the plants alive, harvest just the top two or three pairs of leaves. Nettles are hardy weeds, though, so this may not be a concern.
A very young plant, if the top is clipped, will grow outward into a bushy nettle good for later harvesting.

, You can use fresh or dried leaves to make tea. Each has its own flavor. To dry them, just leave them in a paper bag in a well-ventilated room until dry, but still green. Dry leaves usually don't sting, but they may still cause splinters or minor irritation., Nettle is safe for most people, but may have dangerous interactions with some disorders and drugs. While more studies are necessary, most medical organizations give the following advice:Avoid nettle tea if you are pregnant, as it may cause contractions or miscarriage.
Children and breastfeeding women should not drink nettle tea, as the effects on children are unknown.
Talk to your doctor first if you have issues with blood sugar (including diabetes), blood pressure, blood disorders, or if you are on any medication — even an over-the-counter painkiller.
Start with small quantities, especially if you have any medical ailment or history of allergies.

, Sift through your collection and remove any stowaway bugs. Wash the leaves in a sieve under running water, rubbing off dust or other contaminants with gloved hands.

, Put the leaves in boiling water for 10–15 minutes, or until the water turns light green. One loose cup (240 mL) leaves is enough for two glasses of tea, although you can make it stronger or weaker.


If you don't want to get your kettle mucky, just pour boiling water over the leaves and let steep.

, The leaves will no longer sting you. You may still want to strain the tea through a mesh sieve to make the tea easier to drink.

, Lemon juice or any other acid will turn the nettle tea pink. This will likely be more dramatic if the stems are boiled as well, since they contain more of the color-changing chemicals.Some folk medicine traditions use this alteration for different health benefits. This has not been scientifically studied.
The chemicals responsible are anthocyanin and the related anthocyanin glucosides."

Go with plain brewed coffee.,

Check Starbuck’s nutritional information online.",How to Order Low Calorie Coffee Drinks at Starbucks," Coffee isn’t just delicious; it’s also one of the healthiest drinks in the world apart from water. It is nearly calorie-free and filled with antioxidants, flavonoids, and other nutrients. The thing is, we tend to add all sorts of extras that inflate coffee’s calorie count and turn it into a nutritional pitfall.Plain coffee has almost no calories. To make a healthier choice, order a basic cup of joe and limit the added calories that come in sugar and fat. These usually come from things like sugar packets, syrup, cream, whipped cream, or toppings.
Order whatever size you like. The great thing about plain coffee is that you can have a large serving without a huge calorie count. A short black coffee (the smallest size) has 3 calories; a venti (the largest size) has 5.;
, Espresso was pioneered in Italy. It’s is a kind of coffee that’s brewed by forcing boiling water through finely ground coffee beans and makes a strong, concentrated brew topped with foam or “crema.” While espresso forms the base of other coffee beverages like caffe latte, caffe macchiato, and cappuccino, when served plain it tastes great and is low in calories.Order a single or double shot of plain espresso, or in Starbucks terms a “solo” or “doppio.” The first has 5 calories and the second 10. Be prepared for small portions sizes, however, as the shots will be smaller than your normal cup of brewed coffee.
Caffe Americano is plain espresso, too, made by adding extra hot water to a single or double shot of espresso. It has a few more calories than brewed coffee (5 for a short, 25 for venti), but is still a good option.

, As far as “enhanced” coffees go, cappuccino and lattes fare well enough to be a treat if you want to order something special. Cappuccino is made by adding hot water and steamed milk foam to plain espresso. A latte is also espresso but with added steamed milk and a bit of foam on top.A short cappuccino with regular milk has about 80 calories, which drops to 50 if you opt for non-fat or soy milk. A venti has 110, 120, and 150 calories for non-fat, soy, and regular milk. The calorie count and portion size is a bit smaller than caffe latte but with no lost flavor.
Lattes have more calories, as they contain more milk and thus more sugar: a short has 100 calories with regular milk and 70 with nonfat or soy milk. A venti has 240, 170, and 190, respectively.
Limit the amount of sugar that you add to your cappuccino and latte, because this will increase the calorie and sugar content. Instead, sprinkle some cinnamon or nutmeg on top. These spices are also very low in calories.

, One good rule of thumb at Starbucks is to stay clear of drinks that have long names with extra adjectives. Beverages with “Mocha,” “Vanilla,” “Caramel,” “White Chocolate,” or “Caramel Apple Spice” in the title all sound delicious but promise added sugar, fat, and calories from flavorings and sweeteners. It’s safe to assume that they are a less healthy choice.Take a caramel macchiato, for example. The venti size comes to 240 and 250 calories with nonfat and soy milk and 300 with regular milk — the equivalent of a good-sized snack. These calories come almost entirely from added sweeteners.
The caffe mocha without whipped cream is even worse. A short contains 110 calories with nonfat and soy milk and 130 calories with regular milk; a venti has 280, 290, and 340 calories. Most of these extra calories come from added sugar.

, Keep in mind a basic rule when ordering coffee at Starbucks: bigger is not better, especially if you are watching calories. A venti often has double or even triple the amount of sugar, fat, and calories that a short does. Middle sizes like tall and grande fare a bit better but will still bump up your total count by 40 to 60 calories.Opt for a short caffe latte over a venti, for example. You’ll get between 70 to 100 calories rather than between 170 to 240.
The same goes for the terribly unhealthy White Chocolate Mocha. A short is between 180 to 200 calories, while a venti is the equivalent of a meal: 450 to 510 calories.
The only exception to the size rule is regular brewed coffee, which is almost entirely calorie-free when it’s black. Just limit the amount of milk or sugar you add.

, Many people like milk in their coffee to enhance the taste or because they dislike coffee’s naturally bitter flavor. The milk cuts the bitterness and also give the drink a rich taste; however, milk adds fat and sugar to the beverage. If you can’t take your coffee black, at least ask for low-fat and low-calories alternatives.Consider that a tall cappuccino with non-fat milk is only 60 calories, while the same size with regular milk is 90 calories. That’s a “savings” of 30 calories.
Some Starbucks beverages are only made with low-calorie milks. The “skinny latte” is a great alternative to the classic caffe latte and only uses non-fat milk, for example, as does the Frappuccino Light Blend.
Both of these nonfat milk alternatives have lower calories counts across the board. A short skinny latte is 60 calories, compared to 100 in a short, regular caffe latte. A tall Frappuccino Light is 90 calories, compared to 180 in the regular blend.

, Another big source of calories at Starbucks is added sugar from things like flavor syrups. These go into many of the specialized coffee beverages and tack on dozens of grams of sugar and sometimes hundreds of extra calories. You can better limit your calorie count by asking the barista for a sugar-free syrup or to even go without it.Starbucks offers the option of sugar-free flavor syrup when you customize your coffee, for example. Opt for this over the normal flavor syrup. You can also request sugar substitutes, like packets of Splenda instead of cane sugar.
Better yet, choose a beverage that doesn’t need syrup at all. Starbucks usually adds syrup to iced coffee beverages, for example, but these drinks can be just as refreshing and tasty with nonfat or soy milk and no added sugar.
Consider the sugar content of some of these drinks: a venti iced brewed coffee (with milk and syrup) has between 33 and 36 grams of sugar. That’s about a day’s worth of your recommended sugar intake. The venti Frappuccino has between 66 and 69 grams.

, For choosing a healthy coffee drink, it helps to be able to find your way through nutritional labels in general. These labels can seem daunting, but they’re actually pretty easy to use once you know what to look for. For coffee, you’ll want to focus on three major items: calories, fat, and sugar. Calories are your biggest concern, since they are what gives you energy and can lead to weight loss or gain. More calories over time tends to lead to weight gain, while fewer help you lose or maintain weight.
Look for calories to be featured prominently. Often, the label will tell you how much the whole drink contains; however, it sometimes isn’t so straightforward and requires a bit of math.
Some labels will tell you the “serving size,” say 100 calories per serving. This does not necessarily mean the drink has 100 calories. Make sure to check how many servings the drink contains, too. If a drink has 2.5 servings, you’ll need to multiply 2.5 by the calories per serving of 100. This means your drink has 250 calories in all.

, The two other culprits in coffee drinks are fat and sugar, which come from things like milk, flavored syrup, whipped cream, toppings, or other sugars like honey. As a general rule, all of these extras will add calories to your beverage without adding to the nutritional value. Look for the total content of these ingredients, too.Fat is usually listed early on in nutritional labels. In coffee drinks, most of the fat content comes from milk, whipped cream, or sometimes chocolate.
A healthy coffee beverage shouldn’t have more than 2 or 3 grams of fat.
Remember to multiply fat, if need be. For instance, a drink that has 4 grams of fat per serving might be OK; however, if that drink also contains three servings, the total fat content is a high 12 grams.

, Unfortunately, not all Starbucks stores offer nutritional information and calorie counts in-store, though they ran a pilot program in 2008 and posting this information actually led to fewer calories per transaction. Still, the company posts some nutritional content online. Check their website to access charts and information.Keep in mind that Starbuck’s online data doesn’t feature seasonal drinks, like their speciality Holiday coffee beverages.
You can also ask your barista about the calorie, fat, and sugar content of specific drinks or even call the company’s customer service line directly at 1-800-23LATTE (1-800-235-2883).

This Vanilla Bean Cream Frappuccino is one of the most popular bases for secret menu orders.

, The ability to make secret drinks is mostly due to the profusion of syrups on hand at any given Starbucks. To make the popular Butterbeer Frappuccino, for example, you would get an extra pump of Toffee Nut and Carmel syrups. For medium drinks, get 1.5 pumps, and for larges you would get 2 pumps of each.


Be specific with the barista. Know the pumps you want, and how much, before you order so that you can order in one clear sentence: ""I'd like a Vanilla Bean Cream Frappuccino with a pump of caramel and a pump of toffee nut, please.""

, The following secret drinks have been making the rounds online for a long time, long enough that some baristas will know them without direction.

Cake Batter Frap: Ask your barista for some Almond or Hazelnut Flavoring to add to a Vanilla Bean Creme Frappuccino.
Banana Nut Frap: Hazelnut Frappuccino -- grande or venti -- with an entire banana blended in.

, Some baristas will throw in a few pumps of syrup for nothing, but you're likely to pay a little extra for the mix ins. Be sure to thank the barista for their help and patience and pay the amount they suggest. This is one of the drawbacks of a secret menu, but you'll rarely have to pay more than $1-2 extra.

",How to Make Rosemary Coffee," The best way to add flavor to coffee is by making a simple syrup or infusion and adding it to your finished cup. To make a rosemary infusion, you will only need a few sprigs of fresh rosemary and some water. If you enjoy your coffee sweetened, you can add sugar to the infusion to make a syrup.;
, The basis for a simple syrup is equal parts water and sugar heated until dissolved.


Begin by adding 1 cup (240 ml) each of water and granulated sugar to a saucepan. Begin heating the mixture and stirring it gently.
When all of the sugar has dissolved, the mixture is ready for the rosemary to be infused. The syrup does not need to be boiled down to a thicker consistency.
If you do not want your rosemary coffee to be sweetened, leave out the sugar. Simply begin heating 1 cup (240 ml) of water in the saucepan.

, At this point, place 3 to 5 sprigs of fresh rosemary into the water, submerging them completely.

, Heat the mixture until it just begins to boil, but do not allow it to remain at a rolling boil for long. This can cause the rosemary flavor to become bitter and astringent.

, Once the infusion begins to boil, reduce the heat to low and allow it to gently simmer for about 10 minutes. Stir the infusion occasionally.

, After 10 minutes of simmering, remove the mixture from the heat and allow it to sit. Let the rosemary infuse for about 15 to 30 minutes as the mixture cools. After this time, you can remove the rosemary sprigs and place the infusion in a jar for storage in the refrigerator.

, The rosemary mixture can be added to either hot or iced coffee, brewed using any method. Prepare your cup of coffee as usual, and then add the rosemary infusion by the teaspoon (5 ml) until it suits your taste.

Find a roast and bean supplier you love


Support small farmers from around the world and purchase fair trade coffee beans.,
Find espresso beans whose taste you love


Coffee beans grow in three types: Arabica, Robusta, and Java.,
Purchase and use beans in small batches


You aren’t likely to use beans purchased in bulk quickly enough for them to retain their flavor.,
Always grind espresso fresh and immediately before use.,
Adjust the coarseness of the grind to fit your espresso machine.,
Don’t grind too little or too much – just enough beans to fill the portafilter.

,
Be sure the espresso machine is turned on and there is the correct amount of water pressure.

,
Clean out the portafilter.,
Heat the shot glass and portafilter by turning on the hot water and running them under for five to ten seconds.

,
Overfill the portafilter until you have a centered mountain of grinds, and then knock the portafilter 4-6 times to loosen grounds from the side.

,
Center the tamper on the now flat grounds and make sure it is level with the basket.

,
Push down with the tamper to compact the grounds.,
While pushing down on your final tamp pressure, pivot your elbow clockwise to polish the surface of the grounds.

,
Lock the portafilter with tamped grounds into the espresso machine.,
Time to pull a shot!,
The critical measurements of a double shot are 2.5 ounces total volume in 18-25 seconds.,
Catch fresh shots in a demitasse or other small cup and enjoy!

",How to Pull a Shot of Espresso,"
Buy organic beans; they are not only healthier for you, but for the environment too.
Try beans from different locations around the world. Countries in Central America, Ethiopia, and Indonesia are a few of the leading areas for prime coffee beans.;
, Arabica is typically preferred by most, but try them all to find your favorite.
Not all espresso is dark roast (like Starbucks provides). Taste different roasts to find what suits your buds best.

,
Beans begin to oxidize and go stale shortly after being roasted. They will lose their flavor the older they get.
Buying small supplies of beans allows you to try many different roasts and flavors over time.

, The flavor will remain intact more wholly in a complete bean than in grounds.

, The grounds should not exceed the size of white table sugar.

,,, There should be no old excess grounds or dirty water remaining in the basket.

,,,, It is necessary to apply about 30lbs of force.

,, Make sure the shot glass(es) is positioned under the pour.

, Press the pump button and start timing.

, If your shot is pulling fast or slow, adjust the coarseness and tamp and try again.


The crema – rust colored foam – should take up the majority of the shot glass.
The heart – dark brew-colored liquid – should take up the smallest space of the glass. If this is disproportionate, adjust the coarseness and tamp and pull another shot.
A light tan crema indicates under-extraction or low water temperature.

Include some superfoods.",How to Prepare Make Ahead Smoothie Packs," The most important tool you’ll need to start preparing make-ahead smoothies like a pro is a set of airtight, spacious storage containers. Ziploc gallon bags or plastic Tupperware pieces will work best for this purpose, as they’ll allow the most room to pack in all the different ingredients.Disposable plastic bags can simply be tossed in the trash when you’re finished with them, while Tupperware will provide multiple uses.
Make sure the containers you use are properly sealed to prevent spilling or spoiling.;
, What you put in your smoothies is entirely up to you. You could go with a simple and traditional flavor pairing, like strawberry and banana, or get a little wild with a concoction of papaya, dragonfruit, yuzu and mint. Get creative!


Aim to use about 1 ½-2 cups of fruits and vegetables per smoothie.It’s important that the fruits and veggies you choose be blendable, so avoid tough, stalky types.

, Next, consider what sorts of dry foods you want to incorporate into your smoothie. This could include things like ground whole grains, sun-dried fruits, blended nuts, matcha or coffee beans. Place your dry ingredients in a separate container and stash them away somewhere at room temperature.1-2 tablespoons of dry ingredients will get the job done in most cases.
Don’t forget about extracts, essences and seasonings. Spices like cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg are perfect for enhancing flavor., Now it's time to actually build the individual smoothie packs. Simply pick out an appetizing combination of ingredients, stuff them into the bag or container and seal it up. You can go ahead and include the dry ingredients if they're things that won't absorb moisture and form clumps, or wait throw them into the blender when you mix the smoothies.Put together a few themed flavor combinations, like a tropical pack with pineapple, banana and mango or a sweet-and-sour green pack with green apple, kiwi, spinach and lemongrass.Measure out the amounts of each item in advance to keep the smoothie packs a consistent size.

, Your smoothie ingredients will stay fresh until you’re ready to take them out and put them to use. Freezing the fruits and vegetables also eliminates the need to add ice to the smoothies. Keep the smoothie packs in the freezer for 12-24 hours, or at least overnight.Frozen smoothie packs will be usable for weeks or months on end.
Create enough room in the freezer to store several weeks worth of smoothie packs to spare yourself the effort of filling new containers all the time.

, Just upend the storage container, then sprinkle your dry ingredients of choice over the top. It’s that simple! Since you’ll have already completed the work of portioning out your smoothie packs, preparing the smoothies themselves will be a breeze.Fresh fruit may stick together after a night in the freezer. Give frozen chunks a quick squeeze or stir to break them up.
The storage containers can then be thrown away or washed and reused for a totally hassle-free cleanup.

, Pour in roughly half a cup of milk, juice or any other fluid. This will ensure that your smoothie turns out smooth and drinkable. It will also provide a base for the various components, resulting in a richer, more complex flavor.Health-conscious smoothie aficionados might choose skim milk, almond milk or coconut water as their blending liquid.
Try incorporating a drizzle of natural sweetener, such as honey or agave nectar, for a more indulgent finish., Place the lid on the blender. Pulse the mixture a few times to help break down the larger coarse or frozen fruits and vegetables. Once the blades are spinning freely, blend the smoothie continuously until it reaches the desired consistency.Blend the smoothie longer if you want it to have a uniform smoothness, or a little less if you prefer to leave some hearty chunks of fruit.
If you like your smoothies extra thick and cold, add half a cup of crushed ice right before blending., Your smoothie is now ready to gulp down for a quick jolt of healthy, all-natural energy. You also have the option of transferring the smoothie from the blender to an insulated travel cup and packing it for work, school or the gym. Just be sure to enjoy it while it’s nice and cold!Invest in a compact blender that doubles as a lidded to-go cup for even more versatility on the move.

, Throw one or two rounded scoops of a protein supplement in with your dry ingredients. The additional amino acids will help prepare you for a long day at the office or feed your muscles after a tough workout. Protein plays a crucial role in building healthy tissues and keeps you feeling full longer, making it perfectly suited for a midday snack or meal replacement.1-2 tablespoons of Greek yogurt or organic nut butter can also be used in place of synthetic protein supplements.
Vegan and vegetarian can use animal-free alternatives such as proteins derived from peas, soy or nuts., Most people know that smoothies and fruit go hand-in-hand, but you can also reap the benefits of leafy greens when mixing up an invigorating treat. Spinach, kale, wheatgrass and spirulina are all excellent options. These types of botanicals contain invaluable vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that belong in any balanced diet.To keep your smoothie from tasting unpleasant, stick to the “60/40 Rule”: 60% fruits, 40% greens.Add a splash of citrus juice to cut through the bitterness of more potent greens.

, There’s no better way to put the finishing touches on an already heavenly smoothie than with one or two nutrient-dense offerings like blueberries, chia seeds, pomegranate, oats or cacao. Superfoods won’t only improve your overall health and well-being, they’ll do away with any preconceived notions you might have about how health foods should taste.Contrary to popular belief, you don’t have to make a special trip to a health food store to purchase superfoods. Most of the more common varieties can be found in the produce section of your local supermarket.
Other Grade-A superfoods include sweet potatoes, quinoa, mango, coconut, pumpkin, green tea leaves and ginger."

Transfer the espresso to a cup and add the milk slowly.,
Spoon some foam on top of the latte.",How to Make a Skinny Latte1," The bottom portion of the moka pot is the water tank. Unscrew it from the top portion, and add 2 cups (474 ml) of fresh, cold water to it.Most moka pots have a fill lines that indicate how much water to add based on how much espresso you want to make. Consult the instruction manual for your pot to see if there are guidelines if you want to adjust the amount.;
, Place the filter portion of the pot over the water tank. Fill the filter with 2 ½ tablespoons (16 g) of espresso grind ground coffee. Don't press the coffee down, but you can smooth it with a spoon to ensure that none of the grounds spill out of the filter.You can use pre-ground coffee or grind your own beans, depending on your preference.
Depending on the coffee that you use, you may want to adjust the amount of grounds that you use. Experiment to determine the best amount for the flavor that you like.

, Once you've added the ground coffee, place the top on the pot. Set it on your stove, and turn the burner to high. The coffee will need to brew for 5 to 10 minutes -- you'll know that it's finished when the pot makes a loud gurgling sound.If you have a gas stove, you may not need to use high heat. Experiment with the settings to determine what works best.
If you have an induction stove, you'll need a specialty moka pot.

, While your coffee is brewing, add ½ cup (118 ml) of skim milk to a frothing pitcher. Heat the pitcher on the stove on medium for 3 to 5 minutes to steam it.Use an instant read thermometer to monitor the temperature of the milk so you know when to froth it. It should be between 130 and 150 degrees Fahrenheit (54 to 66 degrees Celsius).
Skim milk is the best option if you want a skinny latte. However, 1% or 2% milk can also work. Just be aware that the latte will just have more fat and calories.
You can use non-dairy milk for the latte as well.

, When the milk is warm enough, submerge the whisk portion of a frothing wand completely in the pitcher. Turn it on low and gently move it around the milk, keeping it fully submerged. After 5 to 10 seconds, increase the speed to high and move the wand up so it's just beneath the surface of the milk to create more foam.Foam made this way tends to dissipate as you drink your latte, so if you want it to last, make a little more than you'll think you need.

, Once the espresso is finished brewing, pour it into a large coffee up. Slowly add the milk to the top of it. Use a spoon to keep the foam from flowing into the cup with the milk.You can add as much steamed milk to the espresso as you like. You may need to experiment to see how much provides the best flavor for your latte.

, When the espresso and steamed milk are mixed, use the spoon to gently place some of the foamed milk on top. Handle the foam gently because it can easily fall apart.You can add as much milk to the espresso as you’d like. However, if your drink has a greater percentage of foamed milk to steamed milk, it is technically a cappuccino, not a latte.

Start with a low-calorie, low-fat liquid base.,
Add fruits and vegetables.,
Include some nuts or seeds.,
Try some spices.,
Add a scoop of protein powder.,
Blend all of the ingredients.",How to Make Diet Smoothies1," Some good choices include fat-free or low-fat dairy milk, soy milk, cool herbal tea, almond milk, juice, or water. Make sure that you consider the fat and calories when choosing liquid bases for diet smoothies because this can have a dramatic effect on the overall fat and calories of your smoothie.


For example, a smoothie made with juice will have up to 200 calories more than a smoothie made with water.The ratio of the liquid base to the fruits and vegetables should be about two to ¾. That means that for every two cups of liquid base you should add about ¾ of a cup of fruit, vegetables, or other ingredients.
Pour your liquid ingredients into the blender first.;
, You can add whatever fruits and vegetables you would like to use. Fresh fruits and vegetables may taste better and have more nutritional value, but frozen fruits and vegetables work well also. Make sure that you look up the fat and calories before you decide. For example, a banana has more calories than an orange or a carrot, and an avocado has more fat than a cup of spinach.


Some good low-calorie fruit choices include peaches, strawberries, oranges, watermelon, cantaloupe, and papaya.Low-calorie vegetable choices include celery, cucumbers, carrots, kale, and spinach.Keep in mind that fresh and frozen fruits and veggies will thicken a smoothie, but frozen fruits and vegetables will also make your smoothie cold. Toss in a handful of ice cubes if using fresh fruit.If you have a high powered blender, then fresh or frozen fruits and vegetables should be easy to blend. If your blender is not too powerful, then you may want to defrost your fruit or even cook the vegetables first to soften them up a bit.
Rinse off fruits and veggies before adding them to the blender to ensure that they are free of dirt and debris.

, Nuts and seeds can be a good addition for adding healthy fats and protein to a smoothie. Just keep in mind that these ingredients will also increase the calories and fat in your smoothie. Some good nuts and seeds to try in a smoothie include:


almonds
cashews
sunflower seeds
chia seeds
flaxseeds, You can also change the flavor of your smoothie without any added fat or calories by adding a dash of spice. Consider what spices will work best with your other smoothie ingredients. For example, if you are making an apple smoothie, then a dash of cinnamon would be a nice complement. Some good spices to consider when making smoothies include:


cinnamon
ginger
nutmeg
cloves
chili powder
cayenne pepper
cardamom

, Adults only need about 48-56 grams of protein per day, so adding protein to your diet smoothie may not be necessary if you get enough protein from other sources. But if you are replacing a meal with a smoothie each day, then adding protein may be a good idea.If you want a diet smoothie that is packed with protein, then add a scoop of protein before you blend.
To keep the fat and calories low, choose a protein powder without added sugars and that is low in fat.
Read labels to find a protein powder that is low in fat and calories.

, After you have all of your ingredients in the blender, place the lid on the blender and blend the ingredients on high for about one to two minutes. You can blend for longer if needed.


If ingredients seem to be getting stuck in the bottom of the blender or on the sides, then turn off the blender, wait for the blades to stop completely, and then use a spoon to stir the ingredients. Then, remove the spoon, replace the lid, and blend on high again.
If the contents of your smoothie seem too thick, then you can add a little more water or other liquid. If the contents seem too thin, then try adding a bit of ice or a couple more pieces of fruit.
