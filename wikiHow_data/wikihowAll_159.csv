Get to know your espresso machine.,
Grind the espresso for your shot.,
Make a shot of espresso.",How to Make Espresso Drinks1," Before you begin, look at the manual for your machine and get a sense of where everything is. Not all espresso machines are alike, but they will all have the same basic parts:


The portafilter, where espresso grounds are placed for brewing.
A hot water knob or button, which turns on the hot water and sends it through the portafilter to make a shot.
An espresso or steam switch that designates whether water should go through the portafilter or the steam wand. On Italian machines, this may be marked with the words ""caffe"" and ""vapore"".
The steam wand, which is used to steam milk.
The steam knob, which controls the amount of steam released from the steam wand.
A grinder, which produces the ultra fine grounds that give espresso its uniquely strong flavor. Most experts agree that owning an espresso grinder is a necessity for home baristas, so if your machine doesn't come with a grinder you should consider buying one.;
, The consistency of the grounds can make or break a great espresso shot.


Purchase espresso beans at your grocery store or local caffe. Espresso beans are characterized by their dark roast.
To make grounds for one shot, measure about 7 gramsof espresso beans using a kitchen scale
Pour the beans into your espresso grinder and grind until they are consistently fine.

Test the grounds by pinching some between your thumb and forefinger. They should feel slightly granular, just short of a powder. .
Adjust your grinder as necessary until it produces grounds at this consistency.



, The perfect espresso shot depends on pressure and timing.


Fill the reservoir of your machine with water.
Turn the machine on. It may take some time for the water to heat
Pack the portafilter full of espresso grounds, then lightly tamp them down so the surface is flat.Try to pack the beans densely so there will be significant water pressure when brewing. This will result in a stronger shot.
Be careful not to pack beans so densely that water cannot get through, because this can cause back-up and overflow. Learning the best density for your machine will take some practice.


Place the portafilter in the machine, and put a standard espresso cup under the portafilter spout.
Set the water to ""espresso"" or ""caffe"" and turn it on to brew your espresso shot.
A single shot should create one to two ounces.
A good espresso shot will have ""crema"" on top, a light brown foam that looks similar to the head on a beer. The more crema, the higher the quality of your shot.

Pour brewed espresso into your cappuccino cup.,
Fill a steam pitcher with cold milk.,
Steam the milk until it's hot.,
Use your steamed milk quickly.The longer steamed milk is left out, the less palatable it will be in a cappuccino.,
Pour the hot milk into the cappuccino cup.A cappuccino should be served in a coffee cup, and you'll ultimately need to combine the milk with the espresso.,
Tell the difference between a good and bad foam.Getting a perfect foam ultimately depends on your skill.,
Use a steam wand with a chilled metal pitcher.A steam wand will heat up your milk in a way doesn't affect the taste of the milk.,
Try a milk frother.,
Shake up your milk for an easy froth.,
Draw art on your cappuccino.,
Add cinnamon and chocolate flakes to your foam.,
Use proper cappuccino cups.,
Serve with small cookies.",How to Make Cappuccino Foam," Although specifics will depend on the type of cappuccino and the person making it, cappuccinos are roughly one quarter espresso and three quarters steamed milk.Pour your desired amount of brewed espresso into a large cappuccino cup before you steam the milk. That way, you'll have everything ready so you can pour out the steamed milk while it's still piping hot.
, Steam pitchers are specifically designed to heat liquid through steaming. Most traditional cappuccinos are served as 6 ounce portions, although many North American outlets prefer a 12-ounce version. Use 3/4 cup to 1 1/2 cups of milk, depending on your preference.

Non-fat milk is best if you're looking to get the most foam.However, non-fat milk will lack the creamy taste of its fatty alternative. It's up to you whether you favor foam or flavor.
Alternatives to steaming with a steam pitcher include using a metal pitcher with a steam wand, using a frother or shaking up the milk in a jar. An authentic cappuccino will rely on steaming, however.

, Steaming milk gives cappuccinos their heat and bubbly quality. You should aim to keep your steamed milk between 140 and 160 degrees Fahrenheit. For the sake of drinkability, it's important not to steam milk past 170 degrees. Depending on the steamer and the amount and temperature of the milk you're steaming, steaming can take between 10-40 seconds in most cases.It's a really good idea to have a thermometer at hand to put in the milk. That way you can make sure it's the exact temperature you want without having to resort to guesswork.

If you don't have a thermometer, you can gauge the temperature increase by putting your hand up against the outside of the pitcher. Wait until the pitcher starts to get warm to the touch. When the outside of the pitcher gets uncomfortably hot, it should be an indicator that the milk has steamed long enough., Milk is very sensitive to heat, and should only be steamed right before it's injected into the cappuccino mug. If you're making a larger batch of cappuccinos at once, hold off from steaming a large quantity of milk at once. Milk that is heated and reheated gets stale and loses its potential for foam., The trick here is to pour the milk in slowly. Any quick movements will risk compromising the foam. Level out your pitcher slowly as you pour.

One way to save the most foam for your top is to take a spoon and use it to trap in the foam at the top of the pitcher. When the pitcher is almost empty, you can pour out the foam.
Even out the foam with a spoon if it's poured out unevenly.

, With that in mind, it may take a few times before you get the kind of foam you want. However, you'll need to be able to distinguish a failure from a success to do so. A proper cappuccino foam should be even and soft. A bad foam will look very foamy and might risk frothing off the sides.

There are two main reasons that could be the cause of a less-than-desired foam result. First, the steamed milk needs to be poured at the right depth. Secondly, the heat may of the steamed milk may have been too high to properly settle into soft bubbles.
Don't be discouraged if you get a bad foam the first time you try it. Perfect coffee beverages require a lot more skill that people give it credit for. Each time you try, you'll get a bit closer to figuring out the subtle movements involved in it.

, Dip your steam wand into the milk until its approximately a centimeter away from the bottom of your pitcher. As heat tends to rise, steaming it from the bottom up will ensure that your milk heats evenly., Unlike a steamer, where the bubbles are a welcome side effect, a frother is specifically designed to give milk bubbles. They're relatively inexpensive and can be purchased online if need be.Put your frother tip about a centimeter below the surface and hold it under for approximately 20 seconds while it froths. Move the frother slowly around the cup to make sure the bubbles are even.

If you use a frother, you won't need to use a steamer to heat the milk. In that case, milk can be heated on stovetop or in the microwave.

, If you're making a cappuccino, it's assumed that you're wanting to go for quality over convenience. All the same, you can get a functional froth by shaking milk up before heating it.Put a cup of cold milk into a sealed jar or container. Shake it vigorously for up to a minute. Immediately after, throw it in the microwave and heat for 30 seconds. The heat is necessary for a proper cappuccino, but heating the milk will also stabilize the microbubbles you'll have formed from the shaking.

This is a good quick fix, and recommended if you're not particular about your cappuccinos. Keep in mind, however that your foam won't look nearly as good as if you steam it.

, Drawing a design atop your cappuccino can be done through purposeful movement as you pour the milk into your espresso cup. It is very tricky to do and can take months for some baristas to get the proper hang of it. However, leaving a simple heart or swirl pattern on the top of your cappuccino foam can make it look all the more professional and classy when it's served. There are lots of possible designs for all different skill levels.For a heart shape, begin pouring in the centre and let shift the pour from side to side.If your steamed milk is really foamy, latte art will be virtually impossible., Cappuccinos are valued for their presentation almost as much as their taste. Cinnamon and chocolate flakes will help to add to both. Once you have your foam settled, sprinkle these on as an afterthought. Even if you're making it from home, this technique can make your cappuccino look like a professional delicacy., Cappuccino cups should be small, plain, elegant and handled. Depending on the size of your cappuccino, the cups you choose should hold up to 12 ounces. Cappuccinos take more effort to make than regular coffee, so you shouldn't use any old cup for it. Even if you think aesthetics don't matter, you may nonetheless find you enjoy the drink more if you put due respect into the way it's served.

Make sure the cup size matches the amount of cappuccino you're serving. Cafe culture tends to value smaller sizes in order to emphasize taste over gorging. Even if you only have a certain amount of cappuccino to drink, putting it in a cup that's too big will rob it of some of its visual appeal.

, Cookies, biscotti, brownies, muffins or other pastry snacks are a longtime friend of cappuccinos and other coffee drinks. Put a couple of cookies on a plate next to your cappuccino. In doing so, you'll elevate it from a drink to a multi-part cafe experience. Enjoy!"

Choose any roast level you prefer for your espresso. Roast levels can vary by region, so try several to find a level that you enjoy the most. Keep in mind that you might prefer different roasts for different purposes.For example, if you're drinking the espresso straight, you might want a single-origin bean that's not roasted very dark. Or if you'll be making the espresso into a latte or cappuccino, you might want a darker roast that will stand up to the milk.;
, If you're buying your beans from a coffee shop, ask when they were roasted. While you want fresh beans, you don't want beans that were roasted within the last day or two, since they'll still be releasing carbon dioxide. Purchase and use beans that were roasted 5 to 12 days earlier.If you're buying your beans from a store, check the label on the bag to find the roast date.

, If you have a high-quality burr grinder, use it to grind enough beans for one espresso shot. The burrs will do a better job of grinding the beans than a cheap metal blade. Grind the espresso on one of the finest settings, so the beans are as fine as granulated sugar. Grind enough beans to get about 7 grams of espresso. You'll use this to pull one 1-ounce (30 ml) shot. Or you could use 14 grams to make a double shot.If the beans are ground too coarsely, the water will run through them too quickly, so the flavor won't develop. If they're too fine, the shot will pull for too long which could make the espresso bitter.
If you don't have a grinder, you can ask your local coffee shop to grind the beans on their espresso setting.

, Although you should only grind enough espresso to use right away, if you have extra espresso, you can store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. Try to use the leftover espresso as soon as you can, since the espresso will lose its flavor the longer it's stored.Avoid storing the espresso or beans in a refrigerator or freezer. These spaces can introduce moisture which will damage your beans.

, Turn on the machine about 15 to 30 minutes before you plan to use it and pull a blank shot, so the machine has a chance to heat up. If your machine isn't connected to a water source, pour water into the tank and ensure that the portafilter is in the machine. Turn the machine on to pull a blank shot of water through the brewhead and into an espresso cup or shot glass.While all machines are different, you'll just need to practice to learn the specifics of using your machine. Read your espresso machine's manual to learn how it should be used.
The hot water will also warm up the espresso cup or shot. Dump the water out right before you're ready to pull the actual espresso shot into it.

, If your machine isn't connected to a water source, you'll need to fill it with clean, filtered water. The machine should heat the water between 197 and 204 degrees F (92 and 96 C). Properly heated water is important to extract all of the flavor compounds of the espresso.Avoid using tap water because it contains minerals that can clog your espresso machine over time. If you use tap water, you'll need to descale your machine frequently.

, Take the portafilter out of the machine and use a clean, dry cloth to wipe the inside dry. Be careful, since the portafilter should be hot from being in the machine. If you're new to dosing, set the portafilter on a digital scale and tare it, so it registers zero.If you've practiced dosing and just know how much espresso to use, you can skip weighing out the espresso. Keep in mind that it's a good idea to occasionally check your dosing for accuracy.

, Place about 7 grams of ground espresso beans into the dry portafilter if you're making a single one-ounce (30 ml) shot. For a double shot, place 14 to 18 grams of ground espresso beans in the portafilter. Check the digital scale to ensure you're dosing an accurate amount., Use a tamp to pack the espresso grounds into the portafilter. This will ensure that the water passes through the espresso evenly. To tamp, grip the handle of the tamp and turn your arm so your elbow is at a 90-degree angle. Set the portafilter on a level surface and push down evenly, so you're putting about 30 pounds of pressure on the coffee.Don't set the clean portafilter on a counter that's got coffee grounds on it.
You don't need to knock the outside of the portafilter after you've tamped the espresso. This will create small cracks in the packed espresso puck and can prevent good flavor from developing.

, Turn the brew head on your machine on for a few seconds. This will rinse away any grounds from a previous brew, so they won't get your puck of espresso dirty or wet. As soon as the portafilter is packed and tamped, insert it into the brew head.

Avoid filling the portafilter and letting it sit with packed espresso. The portafilter should still be hot from being in the machine, so letting espresso sit in it could burn it a little or give a bitter taste.

, Immediately turn your machine on to start the shot and place your warmed espresso cup or shot glass underneath it. You should also start a timer. You'll notice that it takes several seconds before the espresso begins to drip into the cup. It should look creamy and thick as it starts to come out. This is the crema.

Don't put the filled portafilter into the brew head and wait to extract the espresso. The espresso grounds will begin to heat up as soon as they come into contact with the brew head.

, If you're extracting a single shot, you'll probably want to stop the shot once it's brewed for around 20 seconds. If you're extracting a double shot, you'll want to let it go for 20 to 30 seconds. Turn off the machine once you've got the desired volume and the shot begins to turn blonde.Most single shots will be about 1 ounce (30 ml) and double shots are usually 2 to 2.5 ounces (60 to 75 ml).

, Set the espresso on a small plate and serve it right away. You'll also need to remove the portafilter and dump out the puck of moist espresso grounds. Rinse the portafilter out and wipe it dry. Purge (clean) the brew head by running water through it for a few seconds and then return the portafilter to the brew head.Consider serving the espresso with chocolate covered espresso beans or a small cookie. You could also use it in a latte, cappuccino, or flavored coffee beverage.

Pour hot water into the Aeropress.,
Combine the espresso with the ice and milk.",How to Make an Iced Latte2," This method uses a product called the Aeropress, which can be found at many coffee specialty stores. The Aeropress consists several parts: a plastic tube, a plunger, a plastic filter, a paper filter, a plastic funnel, and a plastic stir tool. You can use the Aeropress to make iced coffee drinks and hot coffee. You will need the following supplies for this method:An Aeropress.
Espresso beans.
A coffee grinder.
A cocktail shaker.
A tall glass.
A short glass.
Milk.
Sugar.

, You should use a coffee grinder to grind the beans. Set the grinder to the espresso grind setting so the grounds are fine enough for the Aeropress. You want a medium fine consistency to the grounds.You will need 17 grams of espresso for one iced latte.
You can use a coffee scale to weigh out 17 grams of espresso beans or around 3 ½ tablespoons of coffee beans.

, To give the milk some body, shake up the milk in the cocktail shaker. You can also add sugar to the milk for a sweeter latte and then mix it all up the in cocktail shaker., Then, pour the milk from the cocktail shaker over the ice. This will help to chill the milk while still keeping the milk foamy., Now that you have your espresso ground and ready, you will need to brew the coffee in the Aeropress in a separate glass and then add it to the tall glass with the ice and the milk.To put together the Aeropress, place the paper coffee filter into the deep end of the plastic coffee filter and twist this on to the end of the plastic tube.
Then, place the plastic funnel on the open end of the plastic tube and pour the grounds into the plastic tube. You can shake the grounds around so they are flat and even in the plastic tube.
Place the Aeropress on the top of the glass jar with the part with the filter facing into the jar.

, Boil water in a kettle and then pour the hot water in the Aeropress until it reaches the very top of the Aeropress. You may notice the grounds starting to foam or bubble. This is a good sign, as this indicates the espresso beans still have flavor and have been well roasted.Use the plastic stir tool to quickly stir the water and the grounds about 10 times. Put a timer on for 2 minutes and let the water run through the grounds.
At the 2 minute mark, use the plunger to compress the water and the grounds in the Aeropress. You should have a small glass of espresso once this process is over.

, Slowly pour the espresso into the glass with the ice and the milk. Use a long spoon to stir all the ingredients together. You can add more sugar to taste."

In the Italian tradition, they are always a blend of beans that in addition to being low in acidity, are heavily bodied, and sweet.You can buy a bag of your favorite espresso roast at any coffee shop or grocery store. If you don’t know a lot about different roasts, then just look for “Espresso Roast” on the bag.
If you get whole beans then you will have to grind them properly for espresso, which is a fine grind.You can substitute the espresso for strong coffee if you need, and add just a bit of sugar to mimic the sweetness of espresso.;
, You will need about 3/4 a cup of milk for every cup of espresso. You don’t have to worry about frothing the milk for a Caffe Latte Freddo. Unlike the lattes you usually get at a coffee shop here, this drink has you just mixing the milk into the espresso and shaking.


Whole milk is the standard in Italy, but you can use whichever milk you prefer.Thinner milks will affect how thick your drink ends up being.

, Your ice cubes shouldn’t be too large as the method for making the Caffe Latte Freddo involves shaking instead of blending.


Regular ice cube trays should be fine.

, If you want your drink to taste a bit less bitter you can add sugar to your drink. While espresso roasts are sweeter than other roasts, some people still prefer an even sweeter taste.

, The more pure the water, the better. If you are using water from the tap and it is full of minerals, it may affect the taste of your espresso slightly.


Most average coffee drinkers won’t really notice much of a difference, but the purer the water the more the flavors of the roast will come through.

, In order to ensure that your shots are pulled at the correct temperature you should heat up the espresso maker. Plenty of modern espresso makers will automatically heat up before pulling shots.


If your machine doesn’t preheat automatically, then run your portafilter under hot water to warm it. The portafilter is where you pack in your grounds and if it is cold then this could affect the brewing temperature. If you do heat it with water, make sure it is relatively dry when you put the grounds in it.

, If you have whole espresso beans and have a coffee grinder at home you can grind your beans now for a fresher taste. To ensure you get a proper grind, figure out which kind of grinder you have.


There are a couple types of grinders out there, Burr Grinders and a Blade Grinders.Blade Grinders are better for drip and French Press because they don’t usually offer a super fine grind. A Burr Grinder uses two burrs to efficiently grind your coffee beans and will be able to offer a much finer grind.
If you are using a Blade Grinder, set the grinder to the highest setting for the finest grind.
To see if your grind is fine enough you can do a simple test by pinching the grounds between your fingers. If a small portion clumps and stays compact between your fingers, your beans are ground fine enough.

, There are several types of machines that can brew espresso. While unfortunately your drip coffee maker isn’t suited for espresso, you can find reasonably priced stovetop machines.


You can get an Italian Moka pot which makes espresso in a little metal pot that heats on your stove.If you have an espresso machine, then load it up for one shot, or a double. Most espresso machines will automatically pull a double shot, which for best results should require between 18-21 grams of grounds.If you don’t have either an espresso machine or Moka, you can use a French Press.

, Ensure that your portafilter is securely locked. Then place your shot glass under the spout.For the best roast, you should pull your shots for between 22-28 seconds.

, Make sure that you have measured your milk out correctly so that you get the best taste. Your end result should be a nice light brown color.


Make the mixture in a mason jar if you have one, or use a beverage shaker that will strain the drink while leaving any ice behind.
Pour the espresso in first, then add the milk.

, If you want your drink to be a bit sweeter, and a little more American you can add a tablespoon of sugar.


You don’t have to stir it in as the espresso will dissolve it on its own, and you’ll be shaking the entire mixture which will disperse it evenly.

, If you are using a mason jar, then make sure the lid is screwed on tightly and shake as you would when mixing a drink like a shaken Martini. Use an up and down motion to best distribute and mix your ingredients.

, Your glass should be large enough and suitable for serving coffee beverages.


If you used a drink mixer then pour your Caffe Latte Freddo into a clear espresso glass (or a half-pint glass if you have one), or back into your mason jar.
If you shook your Caffe Latte Freddo in your mason jar and didn’t strain it, then just unscrew the lid.

,


If you have strained your Latte Freddo you can see if there’s any foam left in your shaker and scoop it out, placing it on top of your drink.

Pour the cold brew into a jar.,
Make an iced latte with the cold brew.",How to Make an Iced Latte3," This method requires a little prep work but once you have prepared your ingredients, you can leave the coffee in the fridge overnight to cool off on its own. To use this method, you will need:1 cup coarsely ground espresso beans.
4 cups cold water.
A 16 ounce mason jar with a lid.
A wide bowl.
Cheese cloth.
A colander.
Ice.
Sugar.
Milk.

, Then, pour in the ground coffee and use a spoon to stir the grounds into the water. It’s fine if the grounds float to the top.Cover the mason jar with the lid, sealing it tightly. Place it in the fridge for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours. You can also let it sit at room temperature if you do not have access to a fridge.

, Do this by layering two pieces of cheesecloth into the colander. Pour the coffee and the grounds through the cheesecloth into a bowl. Use a spoon to press the coffee grounds so more of the coffee comes out into the bowl.Rinse off the cheesecloth in the sink to remove the coffee grounds and fold it so there are now four layers of cheesecloth. Place it in the colander and strain the coffee again. You can also strain the coffee through a coffee filter if you have access to one.
Rinse off the cheesecloth and strain the coffee one more time. This will ensure there is less sludge at the bottom of your cold brew, making for a more enjoyable drinking experience.

, You can rinse out the jar you already used or use a new jar. Store the cold brew in your refrigerator so it stays cold and fresh., Now that you have your cold brew ready to go, you can make an iced latte in just a few steps.Fill a tall glass with ice. Add the sugar to the ice or use a flavored syrup to add sweetness. Start with 1-2 tablespoons of sweetener and adjust it to taste once all the other ingredients have been combined.
Fill the glass halfway with coffee and then fill the other half with the milk. Use a 1:1 ratio if you prefer a less strong latte. Use more coffee than milk if you prefer a stronger coffee taste.
Stir the iced latte with a spoon and add more sugar to taste.

Gather your supplies.,
Add sugar.,
Combine the milk and espresso.,
Fill the glass with ice and serve.",How to Make an Iced Espresso," An actual espresso machine will give you the best results for espresso, because the machine is specifically designed to make it rather than coffee.

The main difference between coffee and espresso is the brewing method. Espresso is made by extracting flavor from coffee grounds using high temperatures and pressure. Coffee, on the other hand, doesn’t use pressure to extract the flavor.;
, If you don’t have access to your own espresso maker, there are some simple devices you can use at home. A moka pot, also called a macchinetta, is a small stove-top coffee maker. To make espresso in the moka pot:

Fill the bottom chamber with the water, being sure not to surpass the maximum fill line.
Place the metal filter basket inside the bottom reservoir, and fill it with the coffee. Screw on the top chamber.Close the lid and heat the moka pot over medium heat. As the water in the bottom chamber heats up, it will be forced up through the coffee and into the upper chamber.
When the moka pot starts sputtering, lift the lid. Leave the pot on the heat until the coffee stops bubbling up.
Remove the pot from the heat.

, An AeroPress is a type of coffee press that you can use to make an espresso-type drink. To use the AeroPress for espresso instead of coffee:Insert a new filter in the strainer and assemble the AeroPress. Pour in a little water to wet the filter, and then position the AeroPress over a coffee mug.
Pour in the coffee.
Boil your water in a kettle or a saucepan, and when it boils, pour the water over the coffee. Stir the coffee, and then insert the plunger slightly. Pull the plunger back a little, but not enough to remove it from the column.
Let the coffee brew for two minutes, and then apply gentle and even pressure to the plunger to push the coffee through the filter.
Continue pushing the plunger all the way to the bottom, even when it starts hissing, so you get the crema for the espresso.

, Along with 2 ounces (59 ml) of brewed espresso, ice, and sugar, the only things you need to make this type of black espresso are a martini shaker and a freezer.

Note that this method for making iced espresso takes several hours, because you freeze the black espresso in the freezer to chill it.

, Brew your espresso and pull the shot into a regular demitasse cup. When the espresso is ready, add sugar, to taste, and stir to combine. You add the sugar now while the espresso is still hot to make sure that it dissolves properly., Pour your sweetened espresso into a metal or plastic martini shaker. Keep the lid off, and place the espresso in the freezer for between two and three hours, until it’s chilled and very slushy.While you can add ice cubes directly to hot espresso to cool it down, you'll just end up with a warm and watered down espresso drink.
Chilling the concentrated espresso in the freezer will allow it to retain all of the flavor of the coffee.

, Once the espresso is fully chilled and slushy, remove it from the freezer. Add a few ice cubes, put on the lid, and give the iced espresso a good shake.

You can also add milk to the espresso to make it creamy and delicious. Add it to the martini shaker and shake it up with the ice and espresso.
Serve in martini glasses, aperitif glasses, or tallboys.
Garnish the iced espresso with chocolate shavings, cinnamon, or nutmeg if you like.

, To make a creamy iced espresso, you'll need a tall cup, 2 ounces (59 ml) of brewed espresso, milk, sugar (optional), and enough ice to fill your cup. The more ice you add, the more chilled your espresso drink will be, which is important because you're working with hot coffee.

You can use any milk you like, including whole, cream, heavy cream, or non-dairy milks like coconut, almond, or soy.
Make sure your milk is completely chilled, as this will help to cool the coffee.

, Pull your espresso shot into a regular cup or demitasse. Add sugar, to taste, directly into the cup with the hot espresso. Give the espresso a stir to dissolve and distribute the sugar.It’s important to add the sugar to the hot espresso, because sugar will not dissolve properly in a cold drink.

, Pour your milk into your tall iced espresso glass. Add in the sweetened espresso and stir to combine. By combining the hot espresso with the cold milk, you'll temper, or decrease the temperature, of the espresso and prevent the ice cubes from melting immediately., Once you’ve cooled the coffee by combining it with the milk, fill the glass with ice to chill the coffee. Stir the coffee and ice to fully chill the drink.You can garnish the iced espresso with whipped cream, chocolate shavings, cinnamon, nutmeg, or other spices.

Combine the peppercorns, smashed cardamom pods, cloves, ginger, vanilla bean and seeds and cinnamon stick together in a bowl.;
, Combine the spices and water in a small saucepan. Bring the saucepan to the boil, then cover and simmer for five minutes.




, Add the loose leaf black tea to the saucepan, and continue to simmer for another five minutes. If you do not have loose leaf black tea, it is possible to use a tea bag instead.




, While the tea is simmering, heat the milk using a stand-alone milk steamer or the steam wand of an espresso machine.






Steaming milk is a delicate process. If you're using a steam wand, hold the nozzle just a fraction below the surface of the milk for about five seconds in order to stretch the milk. Then you should submerge the nozzle a fraction further in order to spin the milk in a whirlpool motion.
Continue steaming until the temperature of the milk reaches 140 degrees fahrenheit (60 celsius), or the jug becomes too hot to hold. Consider investing in a steaming thermometer in order to get the temperature just right.
If you do not have a milk steamer, you can warm the milk using a microwave or by heating it on the stove.
Be careful not to burn the milk, as it will affect the taste of the tea.

, Strain the tea mixture into a mug using a fine mesh strainer. Fill the cup half or two thirds of the way to the top.




,





Add the heated or foamed milk to the tea, filling the cup to the top.
Add sugar or honey, to taste.

, There are a number of things you can try to vary your chai latte, according to taste:






Soy chai latte: Try making your chai latte with soy milk - for health reasons, or simply for added flavor.

Apple chai latte: Try making chai with steamed apple juice, as a delicious alternative to a hot apple cider.

Dessert chai latte: To make a delicious dessert chai latte, simply top with whipped cream and a sprinkle of grated nutmeg.

Try another thickener instead of ice or frozen fruit.",How to Make a Smoothie Without Milk or Ice3," You might have a recipe already that you really like, but can't use it because you either don't have the ingredients or you are allergic to them. Fortunately, there are a few ways you can tweak an existing recipe to work for you. This section will show you how to do that.


You can also create your own custom smoothie using this section.

, If you don't have milk at home, you can omit the ice and use yogurt instead. If the recipe calls for frozen fruit, use non-frozen fruit instead, or your smoothie will be too thick.

, There are all sorts of milk available that can work in a smoothie, including: almond, coconut, rice, and soy. Some stores even sell lactose-free cow's milk., Not all smoothies have to be creamy. If you don't like the flavor of almond or coconut milk, you can always use another type of liquid instead. Here are some options:Coconut water (great with tropical fruit)
Fruit juice (such as orange juice and apple juice)
Green tea
Water or carbonated water

, By using frozen fruit instead of ice, you are flavoring your smoothie and thickening it. You can freeze fruit yourself at home, or buy it frozen from the freezer section of a supermarket. Here are some types of frozen fruit you can use:Bananas
Berries (blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries)
Oranges
Peaches
Pears
Tropical fruit, such as mango, papaya, and pineapples

, Ice is mainly used to thicken smoothies. If you don't have any ice at home, or even a way to freeze fruit, you can use all sorts of stuff to thicken it, including:Ground oatmeal
Nuts
Peanut butter

If using a food processor, you may want to add a little less liquid than normal to prevent potential leaks.








You can also use an immersion blender instead of a standard version. Immersion blenders allow you to blend smaller portions in a single serving glass, making them ideal if you want to experiment with small batches.;
, Fresh or frozen fruit will make up the base of your smoothie but note that you can make a delicious smoothie with canned or even reconstituted dried fruit. You can focus on one fruit, or add several. (Figuring out a fruit combination you like is part of the fun of making smoothies!) Here are some options to consider:









Peaches, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, bananas, apples, kiwis, mangoes, avocados and pomegranates are popular choices.
""Juicy"" fruits that contain a lot of water can also work well, such as oranges, watermelon and pineapple. Just be aware that they'll make your smoothie more watery, and make up for it accordingly with a thickener (such as protein powder).
If you're looking for a good starter combination, try strawberry-banana or raspberry-peach.
For a single serving, you'll usually want to add a total of 1/2 cup to 2 cups (125 to 500 ml) of fruit. Use less when sticking with heartier fruits, like bananas, and more when relying on berries., The other main part of your smoothie is the liquid you choose to add to it. Here are some possibilities:









Milk (skim or whole) is a popular choice.
Soy milk works for people who are lactose intolerant, as well as adding some protein.
Greek yogurt (sweetened or plain) will result in a thicker smoothie.
Nut milk (such as almond or coconut) can make the taste of your smoothie different.
Tea (black, herbal or chai) adds antioxidants and can tone down the sweetness.
Fruit juice or concentrate (any flavor) can help make your smoothie more complex if you only have one or two fruits to work with. (Be careful, though - if you're drinking smoothies as part of a diet, sugar-packed fruit juices aren't a good idea.)
Ice cream, sherbet or frozen yogurt. (If you add these items, you probably won't need ice cubes at the end.)
Sparkling water will result in a lighter smoothie (try lime or lemon-flavored).
Water, if you have nothing else on-hand, works great.
Use 1-1/2 cups (375 ml) of any liquid for a single smoothie, or less liquid if you prefer thicker smoothies or need to use a food processor., If you want to make your smoothie resemble an actual meal, add some protein powder to it. Whey and soy are popular choices, but you can also use sprouted brown rice.









Use 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 ml) of protein powder.If you want natural sources of protein, you could also use up to 1 cup (250 ml) cottage cheese or 2 oz (57 g) of tofu., Make your smoothie a little healthier by sneaking in some barely noticeable greens. Kale and spinach blend well, and you won't even be able to taste them. You can also try Swiss chard, celery, beetroot, the greens of vegetables (of radishes, beet, carrots, celery or kohlrabi, for example), or fresh herbs like parsley or dandelion leaves. Or, if greens aren't in season, purchase a green plant powder (available at most health food stores) and add that to your smoothie.









The amount of veggies used should not exceed the amount of fruit if you want to maintain a sweet flavor. The total amount of fruit and vegetables should be 1 to 2 cups (250 to 500 ml)., If you're worried that your smoothie won't taste sweet enough, you can give it a little help. Of course you can always put some plain sugar in the blender, but here are some healthier choices:









Ripe bananas
Honey (used in a lot of ""commercial"" smoothies)
Agave nectar
Stevia (natural sugar substitute)
Splenda (artificial sweetener)
Add sweeteners to taste. Start with 1 tsp to 1 Tbsp (5 ml to 15 ml) and add additional sweetener as needed in small increments.

, Here are some other items you can add to your smoothie to change its taste. Again, experiment and see what you like:









Vanilla extract (1 teaspoon)
Cinnamon (aids digestion)
Cayenne pepper
Nutmeg (only a pinch)
Oreos
Almond extract
Coconut shavings
Peanut butter
Banana
Or any of a myriad of extracts available.

, Once everything's in the blender, put some ice cubes on top. For a single-serving smoothie, 3 or 4 should be plenty.









If you're worried about thinning the drink too much, only add 1 or 2 cubes. You can always add more later.
Frozen fruit can be substituted for some or all of the ice, making for a brighter flavor. You can freeze your own, or buy them pre-frozen.

, Put the lid on the blender, and turn it on no higher than medium. Once the blender starts to ""digest"" the fruit, turn it up one notch at a time. If there isn't a ""smoothie"" or ""shake"" function, ""puree"" works as well. Start slow. Let the blender chew about 1 minute.








, If you like the way it looks, pour your cool concoction into a large glass.









It's a good idea to taste the smoothie before serving it. Add additional flavors and ingredients as desired to improve the taste or consistency.

, Loose berries, a wheel of lemon or lime, a sprig of mint, or flat-leaf parsley can add a fun touch to the final beverage. If you're feeling tropical, add a little umbrella.








, Blend peanut butter, banana, milk, and honey into a delicious, protein-packed smoothie. You'll need to blend all of the ingredients together for 30 to 60 seconds to combine them. For this smoothie, you'll need:









1 banana
1/8 cup peanut butter
1/2 cup soy milk (or regular milk)
2 Tablespoons honey, Combine 2 cup (500 ml) hulled strawberries, 1/2 banana, and 1 peach in a blender. Blend until the fruit is pureed.

Afterward, add 1/2 cup (125 ml) orange juice and 1 cup (250 ml) ice to the blender. Blend until smooth.Pour the smoothie into glasses and enjoy.

, If you're interested in boosting your protein intake and getting some antioxidants into your diet, this might be a good choice.Combine 1 cup (250 ml) frozen berries (blueberries, strawberries, etc.) with 1/2 cup (125 ml) water, 1/4 cup (60 ml) low-fat plain yogurt, 1 tsp (5 ml) honey, and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) unsweetened soy protein powder.
Blend all of the ingredients together at once until smooth. Serve and drink immediately for the best flavor and taste.

Choose your coffee beans.,
Acquire a high quality grinder with a burr.,
Grind your coffee beans finely.,
Locate an espresso machine.,
Choose an espresso cup.,
Fill the espresso machine’s reservoir with cold, filtered water.,
Let your water heat up.,
Place 14 grams of the ground coffee in the filter.,
Tamp the coffee in the filter.,
Return the filter to the machine.,
Brew for 15 seconds.",How to Make a Ristretto (Espresso Coffee)," You can choose beans that you would use for an espresso, such as an Arabica or Robusta bean. An Arabica bean will be sweeter with hints of berries and a higher acidity. The Robusta has a stronger, nuttier taste and contains more caffeine than the Arabica.Check out local coffee beans for new and different kinds of Arabica or Robusta beans.;
, Purchase a burr grinder that grinds the beans between two abrasive surfaces. This will result in more consistent and fine grounds. If your grounds are not consistent, this may lead to some going through the filter and into your ristretto.Chances are the grinder you already have is one with a blade that’s for brewing a regular cup of coffee, so double check before you throw the beans in there.

, You should grind your coffee beans more finely than for an espresso. A finer grind will cause less water to flow through the beans, which results in a less bitter taste., An espresso machine is necessary to make a ristretto so you’ll need to get one if you don’t already have one.


Ask a friend who has an espresso machine if you can come over and make them a new type of coffee if you don’t have one.

, Most ristrettos are served in espresso cups, so make sure you have one handy! They’re usually about the size of a shot glass and are either glass or ceramic.Some espresso cups have handles and some don’t, so choose whichever kind appeals to you most.

, Using cold, filtered water matters! Unfiltered water won’t taste good, distilled water can ruin your machine, and hard water can accumulate lime in your machine., Turn on your espresso maker by pressing the power button and let the water heat up, which could take anywhere from a few minutes to 45 minutes.Many espresso machines will have a light that turns from red to green to signal that the water is heated.

, Using about 14 grams of ground coffee is the amount your espresso machine needs to produce a single cup of strong ristretto., You should tamp, or pack down, the coffee in the filter as you would do in an espresso. Tamping will get rid of spaces between coffee grinds.


If you didn’t grind your coffee very finely, you should tamp down your coffee more firmly to allow less space between the grinds., Put the filter back into the machine by sliding it into place and then turning it towards your right to lock it into position. Get ready to brew!

The filter isn’t hidden under a cover like it is in normal coffee machines. Instead, it slides into a cylindrical mechanism in the middle of the espresso machine.

, To turn on the water flow, most espresso machines have a knob that you have to twist on. You should only pull water through the beans for 15 seconds. This will result in a less acidic and fuller taste.You should end up with about 0.5oz (~15mL) of coffee.

Grind the beans until they're finely ground.

Finely ground coffee beans are about the size of salt grains. This is the ideal grind for espresso.
You can also buy pre-ground espresso beans from grocery stores and coffee shops if you don’t have a grinder.;
, On a professional or home espresso maker, remove the portafilter from the group head. Fill the clean portafilter with the freshly ground coffee. Tap the portafilter against your hand to distribute the grounds, and then tamp the grounds to compact them.If you don’t have access to a professional or home espresso maker, you can use a stovetop espresso maker. Pour the grounds into the inner basket and spread them around evenly with your finger.
Use strong coffee in place of the espresso if you don’t have any means of making espresso.

, Return the portafilter to the position in the group head and turn it to lock it in place. Place a demitasse cup under the portafilter and turn on the water to pull the shot. Let the water run for about 30 seconds to fully extract the shot. Stir the espresso to distribute the crema, which is the foam that builds up on top.

With a stovetop espresso maker, fill the reservoir with water to the maximum fill line. Place the filter inside the reservoir and screw on the top. Heat the espresso over medium heat until it bubbles over into the top reservoir. Pour the espresso into a demitasse.

, Transfer cold milk to a tall metal container. Hold the container at a 45-degree angle to the steam wand. Insert the steam wand into the milk and turn on the steam.

, Macchiatos are not traditionally served with whipped cream, but you can still garnish your drink with a little whip if you like. After adding any flavor shots and pouring the milk, spoon or spray a small dollop of whipped cream on top of the beverage., Grated chocolate is a delicious way to finish an espresso beverage, especially if you’ve got some whipped cream on top already. When your macchiato is ready, shave a block of chocolate shavings directly onto the milk or whipped cream.

You can use dark, milk, or white chocolate to garnish your drink.

, Another way to change the flavor of your macchiato is to add a dash of ground cinnamon to the top after the milk has been poured.If you're getting your macchiato with whipped cream, sprinkle the cinnamon on last.

Tamp the coffee.,
Make the espresso shots.,
Pour the steamed milk over the espresso.",How to Make a Latte1," Espresso uses a very finely ground coffee. The coffee grounds should be about the size of the grains of table salt. The coffee grounds will clump and stick together when they are the correct size.

Once you become more experienced with making espresso drinks, you can experiment with the grind of your coffee to get the exact flavor you like.
Grind the espresso beans in a burr grinder for added freshness and control. Burr grinders will let you control how fine or coarse your espresso grounds turn out, and will result in a more consistent grind.;
, For a single, small latte you will need about 6 ounces of milk.A good rule to follow is that you will need 6 ounces of milk per ounce of brewed espresso.Nonfat milk is the easiest to make foam but doesn't taste as decadent as milk with more fat.Two percent milk produces foam nicely, while adding a little bit of creaminess to your drink.Whole milk is the hardest milk to foam, but makes a more flavorful latte due to its higher fat content. , Pour your desired amount of milk into a metal pitcher. Insert the steam wand diagonally into the milk, resting it just below the surface. This will create the froth necessary for a good latte by allowing air to get into the mix along with the steam.

Grasp the handle of the pitcher with a towel to prevent your hand from getting scorched as the pitcher heats up.
Open up the steam hatch by turning the appropriate knob on your espresso machine. This is often a dial you need to twist.
Using a thermometer, steam milk until it reaches a temperature between 150ºF and 155ºF. Be careful not to steam the milk above 170ºF or it will scorch.
Aim for small, light bubbles (called microfoam) instead of big, soapy bubbles. The foam should have lightness without sacrificing body., Each espresso shot will need to have a specific amount of coffee. Most lattes are made using a double shot of espresso, which means two shots.

For each shot of espresso measure out 18-21 grams of ground coffee. You can do this by putting the espresso machine's portafilter on a kitchen scale.
Zero the machine with the empty portafilter on it.
Carefully add 18-21 grams of coffee per espresso shot.

, This is when you compress the ground espresso into the machine's portafilter using an espresso tamper. This looks like a small weight with a little handle on top.

To tamp the coffee, grasp the tamp handle with your fingers. Position your hand, elbow and forearm directly above the portafilter and push down.
Tamp down using an even twisting motion. Apply between 30 lbs of pressure for an ideal tamp.Press down on a bathroom or kitchen scale to get a sense of how hard you'll have to press on the portafilter.
Tamping will create a ""puck"" of coffee. It is important that this is evenly compressed so the espresso will brew evenly.

, Lock the portafilter into the group head on the espresso machine. Press the brewing button on the machine to start making the shots.


A perfect shot has a dark to medium brown with a minimum body and a small amount of cream (crema) or foam on its surface.
A shot is brewed in about 30 seconds, but this will depend on both your grind and your machine. Taking too long to brew the espresso may result in bitterness, whereas not taking enough time will result in losing some of the flavor. , The froth will pour smoothly and blend with the espresso cream.


When pouring, use a spoon to regulate the flow of the foam. Make sure no foam enters the drink until you are about 1/4 in. from the top, where you can remove your spoon.
The result should be a nice creamy brown drink base with a thin frothy top.
Now is the time to make latte art if you're adventurous. This is entirely optional.

Measure out two Aeropress scoops of coffee. Grind the coffee with an electric grinder.
For an espresso based drink like a latte, make the grinds very fine (as fine as table salt). The grinds will stick together and clump when they are finely ground. This is what you should watch for when grinding.
Assemble the filter in the Aeropress cap. Wet the filter in the Aeropress. This will prepare the filter and remove any paper taste from your coffee.
Place the Aeropress on top of your cup.
Make the coffee. You will need to add the coffee and water to the Aeropress.
Add ground coffee to the cup using the funnel. Add hot water up to the fill line on the Aeropress.
Use the paddle stirrer or a spoon to mix the coffee and water.
Insert the plunger onto the Aeropress and press down until you hear a long hiss.
Taste the coffee. If it is too strong you can add some hot water to dilute it.

, If you don't have a pour over device like an Aeropress, you can use a regular filter coffee maker.

Use 1-2 scoops of coffee per cup of coffee made. You will want the coffee to be very strong to make a latte.
Preferably, you can grind the coffee yourself to a finer grind.
You will need 1-2 cups of coffee for a latte.

, It is a common misconception that you need a milk steamer to froth milk! You can do this using your microwave:Use a non-fat milk, such as 2 percent, for best results.
Pour some cold milk into a jar with a lid. Do not fill the jar more than halfway.
Seal the lid tightly.
Shake the milk in the jar vigorously for 30 to 60 seconds, until the volume has doubled.
Take the lid off of the jar.
Microwave the milk on high for 30 seconds.
The foam will rise to the top.

, Then add the milk to your coffee.


Use a spoon to keep the foam back when pouring your milk in.
Once you have enough milk into your latte, add a spoon of foam on top.
Enjoy your homemade latte!

Drizzle caramel syrup.",How to Make a Caramel Macchiato1," Preheat your mug by filling it with hot water, letting it sit, and pouring out the water. Drizzle the sides of the mug with 1 ounce of vanilla syrup.


You could also do a combination of vanilla and caramel syrup drizzled along the sides of the mug if you prefer a stronger caramel flavor.;
, Pour 3/4 cup (180 ml) milk into your small metal pitcher. If you like a very sweet caramel macchiato, consider adding caramel to the milk that you steam. Otherwise, the milk will be sweetened from the vanilla on the sides of your mug and from the caramel that you'll drizzle on the finished drink.

You'll steam more milk than you'll end up using. This allows you to create foam and easily steam the milk.
You can also use soy, almond, or hemp milk although they may steam differently than milk.

, Start with a clean portafilter and dose 18 to 21 grams of espresso grounds into the basket. Level the grounds using your finger. Set the portafilter on a clean surface and tamp down on the grounds. Make sure you're applying even pressure so the espresso remains completely level. Aim for 20 to 30 pounds of pressure, or enough to pack the espresso compactly.

Practice your dosing by dosing and checking the weight of the grounds on a digital scale. Continue to do this until you're regularly dosing between 18 to 21 grams for a double shot.

, Insert your filled portafilter into a clean grouphead on your espresso machine and immediately start pulling your shots. It will take a few seconds before the espresso begins dripping out of the machine. Let it keep extracting until it starts to turn blonde or yellow. A double shot of espresso should take 25 to 30 seconds to pull., While your shots are pulling, steam the milk in your small metal pitcher using the steam wand of the espresso machine. Heat your milk to 150 to 160 degrees. It may help to use a thermometer and stop steaming when it reaches 140. The milk will continue to heat even after you've removed the steam wand. To create plenty of foam for the macchiato, allow the tip of the steam wand to gently tap the surface of the milk so that it sucks in air. Tap the pitcher once you're done to break any large air bubbles.


Clean the steam wand with a clean wet cloth until no milk remains on the wand. Purge it by turning it briefly so that any liquid that was left in the wand is sprayed out.

, Pour the steamed milk into your preheated mug. Make sure that you include foam at the top of the drink. Take your espresso shots and pour them directly over the foam so they slowly sink down into the bottom of the drink. Don't stir the caramel latte macchiato.If you're having trouble pouring plenty of foam, use a long bar spoon to scoop the foam onto the top of the drink.

, Drizzle caramel syrup across the top of the foam so that you create a design. You can make swirls, diagonal lines, or the familiar crosshatch pattern.It may help to put the caramel syrup into a squirt bottle. This will allow you to easily create a caramel design.

,
Serve on a saucer!",How to Make a Soy Vanilla Latte," To make a creamy soy latte, the best idea is to froth the milk first, before doing anything else. This allows the milk to settle and the froth to rise to the top of the jug, creating a nicer pour.;
,, Lift the jug up until the steamer is sitting just under the top level of the milk.

,, This means that the air is getting sucked into the milk and slowly causing it to become light and frothy.

, This helps monitor the temperature of the milk. Keep your hand lightly resting under the jug until you feel it is warming up.

, When it is starting to become quite hot and you can no longer keep your hand under the jug, turn the steamer off.

, It should read between 65–75 °C (149–167 °F). The recommended (perfect) temperature for the milk to be is 70 °C (158 °F), but within the stated range is fine. Anything hotter than 75 and the milk will smell and taste burnt. This is NOT a good sign.

, If the milk is not at the recommended temperature, you will have to repeat this process with a new jug of soy. You cannot reheat the milk otherwise it will become too hot, or burnt. Frothing soy milk takes a LOT of practice, so don't be surprised if you can't get it on your first go!

, Then it will settle and give time to allow the froth to flatten.

,, You will only need enough so it covers the bottom of the glass. Around 1-2 teaspoons should be suffice. That is usually up to the customer though, depending how sweet they want their coffee.

Steam the milk.,
Mark the espresso with the steamed milk.",How to Make a Caramel Macchiato2," Pour 1/2 cup (240 ml) of milk into your small metal pitcher. If you have a larger pitcher, you'll need to use more milk so that it comes at least 1/3 of the way up the side of the pitcher. Add 1 ounce (29 ml) of caramel syrup to the milk and set the pitcher aside.

You'll steam more milk than you'll end up using. This allows you to create foam and easily steam the milk.
You can use any type of milk so play around with what types you like to use. Some people find that nonfat milk creates thick dry foam, while others prefer full-fat milk for rich foam made of tiny bubbles.

, Start with a clean portafilter and dose 18 to 21 grams of espresso grounds into the basket. Level the grounds using your finger. Set the portafilter on a clean surface and tamp down on the grounds. Make sure you're applying even pressure so the espresso remains completely level. Aim for 20 to 30 pounds of pressure, or enough to pack the espresso compactly.

It will take a few seconds before the espresso begins dripping out of the machine. Let it keep extracting until it starts to turn blonde or yellow. A double shot of espresso should take 25 to 30 seconds to pull.Pull the shots into a tiny metal pitcher or you can pull them directly into a small demitasse cup that you want to serve the caramel macchiato in.

, While your shots are pulling, steam the milk and caramel syrup in your small metal pitcher using the steam wand of the espresso machine. Heat your milk to 150 to 160 degrees. It may help to use a thermometer and stop steaming when it reaches 140. The milk will continue to heat even after you've removed the steam wand. To create plenty of foam for the macchiato, allow the tip of the steam wand to gently tap the surface of the milk so that it sucks in air. Tap the pitcher once you're done to break any large air bubbles.


Since you're steaming such a small amount of milk, it won't take long for the milk to froth.
Remember to clean the steam wand with a clean wet cloth. Purge it by turning it briefly so that any liquid that was left in the wand is sprayed out.

, To mark the shots, you can pour a small amount of steamed milk into the espresso, making sure to include some of the foam. Macchiatos are generally made with an equal ratio of steamed milk and espresso.Or, if you don't think you can pour enough of the foam, you can use a long bar spoon to scoop foam on top of the macchiato.


Consider serving your macchiato with a chocolate covered coffee bean. You may also want to set the macchiato on a small plate with a serving spoon. This way, you can stir the foam and espresso, if you like.

Fill the strainer with your espresso-ground coffee and wipe away any grounds on the edge. Screw on the top of the pot and set it on your stove over low heat. Heat the espresso until you hear gurgling and the water boils. Turn off the heat once the moka pot is full of espresso. Stir the pot and use the espresso right away.Avoid packing down the espresso in the strainer. This can clog your moka pot.
You should heat the moka pot for 5 to 7 minutes.;
, Put the filter into the filter cap and twist it onto the chamber. Set the the chamber on top of the glass you want to serve the cappuccino in and measure 1 mounded scoop coffee into the chamber. Carefully pour boiling hot water up to the one mark. Stir the espresso for 10 seconds and then insert the aeropress plunger into the chamber. Slowly press down until you hit the grounds. This will extract the espresso.Use fine-ground coffee in the aeropress and shake it once it's in the chamber. This will ensure that the espresso is extracted evenly.

, An espresso machine is one of the best ways to get espresso with rich crema on top. Follow your machine's instructions to fill the portafilter with espresso grounds and insert it in the brew head. Start the machine to get a single or double shot of espresso.

You can make cappuccino with as much espresso as you like. Consider using a single shot in a small cappuccino or use a double shot for a larger cappuccino.

, You can use any type of milk you prefer, but keep in mind that whole milk will steam the easiest and create the best foam. If you use skim milk, it may separate more. Or you can use soy, nut, or rice milks. These may steam a little differently, so pay attention to how you heat them.

To make a simple mocha cappuccino, you could use chocolate milk.

, Pour cold milk into a clean, chilled pitcher. You should pour in more milk than you actually plan to drink. For example, if you want to make an 8-ounce (236 ml) cappuccino, you'll need to pour in 10 to 12 ounces (295 to 355 ml) of milk. This will allow the milk to expand and make it easier to pour.Using a chilled pitcher will make the milk steam longer which will create a smoother texture.

, Before you insert the steam wand into the pitcher of milk, turn it on briefly to purge (clean) out any water that's resting in the wand. Once it steams a little, turn it off and then insert it into the pitcher of milk. Immediately turn the wand back on and tilt the pitcher at a slight angle, so the milk heats and swirls.

If you're new to steaming milk, you may want to clip a thermometer to the inside of the pitcher, so you can track how quickly the milk heats up. Keep in mind that the milk will continue to heat up after you've stopped steaming the milk.

, Occasionally tilt the steam wand close to the surface of the milk. This will introduce air into the milk which creates the foam. You'll only need to do this for a few seconds or you'll risk making a lot of really dry foam. When you notice the milk getting around 150 to 160 degrees F (65 to 70 C), turn off the steam wand and remove the milk pitcher.Remember to purge the steam wand and wipe it clean with a wet cloth once you've finished steaming the milk.
The steamed milk should be glossy and smooth, not dry or lumpy.
Keep one of your hands on the side of the pitcher, so you can feel how hot it's getting. Remove your hand when it gets around 150 to 160 degrees F (65 to 70 C).

, If you don't have a steam wand attached to your espresso machine, you can warm the milk in the microwave and shake it to create some foam. Place nonfat or low-fat milk into a small mason jar, so that it's at least half full. Put the lid on the jar and shake it for 30 seconds to 1 minute, so the milk foams up a lot. Remove the lid and microwave the jar for 30 seconds.The foam will only last for a few minutes with this method.

, If you don't have a steam wand, you could just heat the milk on the stove or in a microwave. Use a small, handheld milk frother or whisk to create the foam. Just continue to whisk or froth the milk until you have as much foam as you'd like.

This method will make lots of foam, but it may have more bubbles in it than if you steam the milk.

, Gently tap the pitcher of steamed milk onto the counter, so any large bubbles pop. This should leave only microfoam which smooth and glossy. Swirl the pitcher a little to keep the milk and foam from separating before you pour it., If you didn't pull the espresso directly into your cup, pour the espresso you made (in the moka pot or aeropress) into your serving cup. For a small cappuccino, use 1 shot (30 ml) of espresso. For a larger cappuccino, use 2 shots (60 to 80 ml).

Try to warm your cup before you add the espresso and milk. This will keep your drink warmer for longer.

, Hold the cup with the espresso in it with one hand. Tilt it to the side and use your other hand to slowly pour the steamed milk into the center of the espresso. As the cup fills up, gradually move the cup, so it's level and pour a little faster to get the foam onto the top of the drink. Serve the cappuccino immediately.If you don't feel comfortable pouring the milk and foam in, you can use a long stirring spoon to hold the foam back. Then spoon the foam onto the top of the cappuccino.

Identify your grinder.,
Place the beans in the grinder.,
Select a fine or superfine grind size.,
Test the coffee grounds.",How to Grind Espresso Beans1," These grinders use small, spinning discs to shave apart each bean precisely, which produces a more consistent grind. Any grinder that comes with an espresso machine, or is attached to one, should be a burr grinder. You can also purchase a burr grinder separately, although it may cost several hundred dollars.

Low-speed burr grinders are less likely to burn the beans when grinding it fine for espresso, but may be more expensive than high-speed grinders.Conical burr grinders and flat grinders both have their fans; one type is not definitively better than the other.;
, You can grind as many beans at once as can fit loosely in your grinder, but keep in mind that ground coffee won't stay fresh for more than a day or two. If you want to grind only enough for one espresso shot, you may have to experiment to see how many whole beans to use. Typically, one tablespoon (15 mL) is enough, but results vary depending on the variety of coffee bean and how fine the coffee is ground. Regardless of how many beans you used, one espresso shot takes roughly 0.25 ounces (7 grams) of coffee grounds, enough to fill the filter on your espresso machine and add a small mound on top.., Almost every burr grinder model has settings for how fine to make the coffee grounds. For espresso, you'll want to make fine or superfine grounds. Some models have a numerical scale instead; with these, it's best to experiment with several settings to see which produces the cup of espresso you prefer.

A setting that works for one type of coffee bean may need adjusting for another type. If you frequently switch between beans, you might want to write down which setting works for each of your favorite types of bean.

, Take a small pinch of coffee grounds between your thumb and finger, then separate your fingers and examine the grounds. If the coffee fails to clump together and falls in separate pieces, it needs more grinding. If it is a powder that leaves an outline on your fingerprint, it is too fine and may not produce a good espresso. Finely ground coffee that clumps together on your finger is perfect for espresso.A burr grinder should produce consistent results, at least until it eventually wears down after many uses. Once you've found a setting you like for a particular bean variety, you don't need to keep testing every time.

, For a more refreshing smoothie, consider adding 2 cups (400 grams) of strawberries and/or 1 tablespoon of lime juice. You can use fresh or frozen strawberries; the frozen strawberries will give you a thicker, colder drink., Both will lend the watermelon a refreshing flavor. Make sure that you chop them finely first to help them blend better., If the watermelon you are using is already very sweet, or if you are not fond over overly-sweet drinks, you can omit this., If you added frozen strawberries, then you probably do not need to add the ice., Keep blending until the ice has all broken up, and everything is combined. If the smoothie is not blending very well, pause the blender, and use a rubber spatula to push any unblended mixture down the sides.

, For an extra touch, garnish each smoothie with a small watermelon slice or a mint/basil leaf.

Identify your grinder.,
Place the beans in the grinder.,
Grind the beans in short bursts of two or three seconds.,
Stop when the beans have been ground for at least twenty seconds total.,
Test the ground coffee.,
Scrape out all remaining grounds to use in your espresso.",How to Grind Espresso Beans2," If you are using a grinder with spinning blades, follow these instructions. Typically, these grinders have a detachable plastic lid, and turn on when the lid is pressed down, but some models are operated with a button or hand crank instead. They will not produce grounds as consistent or fine as higher-quality ""burr grinders,"" but they tend to be much cheaper., Some grinders only have room for a small handful of beans, so you may have to grind in several batches if you are making a large number of espresso shots. Don't try to force the beans tightly into the grinder, or you may not have room for the lid., If you grind the beans for too long, the friction can overheat the beans, making them bitter. Instead, turn the grinder on for no more than three seconds at a time, waiting two seconds between bursts., The exact amount of time it takes to grind depends on the grinder model and blade sharpness. However, since espresso is typically made with finer ground beans than a hand grinder can produce, it's unlikely you'll be able to over-grind it. Grind it for at least twenty seconds total, not counting the pauses in between grinds., Unplug the grinder and remove the lid. If there are obvious chips of coffee bean in the grounds, grind the beans for a few more bursts. Otherwise, pick up a pinch of grounds between your thumb and finger. If it's ready, it should clump together on your fingertip, not fall off in separate particles.You may not be able to achieve the perfect fine grind with this type of grinder. If the grinder won't produce grounds with the consistency described, settle for no visible large chips of bean being present.

, There are usually hard-packed chunks of coffee grounds stuck to the inside of the grinder. Use a spoon to remove all of these grounds right after you're done grinding them. If you leave grounds in there for multiple grindings, they can burn and add an unpleasant taste to your espresso."
"
Unplug the grinder before cleaning to avoid injury.,
Use a vacuum or compressed air to get rid of coffee grit when it builds up.,
Wipe down the inside of the grinder occasionally.,
Clean or replace your grinder's burrs.",How to Grind Espresso Beans3," Unplug your grinder before cleaning to avoid accidentally turning it on while your fingers or cleaning implements are inside., Bits of coffee ground will build up around the working parts of any type of grinder, slowing them down and potentially adding off-flavors to your espresso grounds. If you notice these effects or see pockets of encrusted coffee ground, use a vacuum's wand attachment or a can of compressed air to remove them.Dislodge larger pockets with a spoon if they are not moving., Oils from the coffee beans can stick to the sides, adding off flavors. Remove the grinding chamber if possible on your grinder model, and rinse with water. If your grinder cannot be disassembled, use a slightly damp paper towel instead to avoid causing an electrical short. Either way, wipe clean with a dry cloth after washing., Most burr grinders can have the outer burrs removed by untwisting the ring that holds them in place. Others need to be cleaned while inside the grinder. Every few weeks, or more frequently if you use the grinder daily, scrub with a new toothbrush or other small, clean brush. If your grinder fails to create a fine grind even after cleaning, you may need to purchase replacement burrs from the manufacturer.

Some people run rice or other objects through their grinders to clean off coffee residue, but this can shorten the lifespan of the burrs."

Try several varieties of espresso bean.,
Store beans in a cool, dry place.,
Grind beans shortly before you make the espresso.,
Grind a few beans first when switching coffee blends.",How to Grind Espresso Beans4," Espresso beans are roasted specifically for use in espressos, and will likely produce better results than ordinary coffee beans. While there are many, many varieties and blends of espresso bean, the most basic distinction is between the lighter Arabica and darker Robusta. While espresso is more concentrated and dark than regular coffee, this does not mean it needs to use blends high in Robusta beans. A blend with as little as 10-15% Robusta will produce a dark, ""biting"" espresso without additional, potentially unpleasant flavors from overuse., Find a dark spot at the back of your cupboard or pantry, not the fridge where it can pick up food smells and moisture. Use any container with an airtight, watertight seal. Even when stored this way, beans tend to lose quality rapidly after one or two weeks.Freezing may or may not affect the taste of espresso beans. Opening the container of frozen beans, however, causes harmful moisture to condense on the beans. Divide the espresso beans into multiple containers to limit the number of times each one is opened. Pack tightly to remove most of the air., Espresso will stay freshest as whole beans, not grounds. Try to use up all your grounds within a few days after they are ground for best results., If you are switching to a new coffee beans or blend and want to get a pure flavor, run a few beans through the grinder first to remove most of the coffee grit from the last variety you used. You can use this for espresso if you don't mind a mixed cup, or simply toss it in the compost or trash."

It'll be easiest on your blender if you cut off the tops and then cut them in half.
Make sure you're using a clean knife and cutting board!;
, A Magic Bullet or food processor will work, too.

, 2% will make for a creamy, thicker smoothie, but non-fat, soy, and almond work, too. If you don't have milk, yogurt works as well.

, For a thicker, colder smoothie, throw the ice in the blender with everything else. However, if you'd like your smoothie to be more concentrated (at least initially), you can just put the ice into the smoothie when it's finished. Decisions, decisions.

, Depending on the strength of your blender and the size of your ice cubes, this should take anywhere from about 15 seconds to a minute. It may need a stir to get the last chunks of ice smoothie-ready, so break out your spoon if need be. Did someone say taste test?

, If the strawberries are sweet enough, you may not need the extra zing. Or if you'd like something more natural, honey is a great alternative. It's a good idea to try it out and see. If you add too much, you can always add more strawberries or milk!

, Cut a strawberry in half, then slice half of it so you can put it on the edge of the glass for a garnish. Grab a straw, your cocktail umbrella, and you're set.


A chilled glass is even better -- it keeps the smoothie from becoming runny too quickly. Keep one in the freezer for the next time a smoothie craving strikes without warning.

, The recipe above makes one strawberry smoothie. Watch out -- smoothies have been known to bring boys and girls to the yard, too. Hope you have extra ingredients on hand for when you're expected to share!

Add the ice cubes.,
Blend on low and gradually move to high.,
Enjoy!",How to Make a Simple Strawberry Smoothie2," 10 is a good number for a single serving, but more is always welcome. You could always double the batch for later! Grab your cutting board and knife and see where the moment takes you.

, Water will do the job and highlight the sweet strawberry-ness of your drink, but juice will get it more pizzazz -- apple, pineapple, mango, heck, even grape or cranberry. It'll drive down the strawberry flavor, but it'll give your smoothie or more complicated, sharp twist.

, Honey is mother nature's sugar, but the white stuff will do the trick, too. However, both are optional! If your strawberries are sweet enough, your smoothie may not need it.


You can always blend everything else up and then see if your smoothie needs sugar. An excuse for a preemptive spoonful, really.

, The smaller they are, the easier it'll be on your blender, but they'll eventually get decimated all the same. If you're wary of adding too much ice, try adding half now to be blended and then adding 1 or 2 whole to your drink at the end to keep it chilly.


Another good alternative is a chilled glass -- that way the glass acts as the ice and your smoothie stays a thicker, more filling consistency.

, The ice gets pummeled on the low setting, but it all smoothie-fies on high. You'll know it's done when everything is a red fruity liquid. Grab a spoon -- how's it taste?


Then you may want to blend it on high for another 30 seconds to aerate. This will give it a bit of volume, too (read: more bang for your smoothie buck).

, Garnish with a wedge of fruit -- maybe lemon, lime, pineapple, or more strawberry? A straw and an umbrella, too! Ah, fruity goodness. Have fun making and drinking!

, Syrup should be poured into the bottom of the cup before adding the coffee to ensure it mixes well. It is recommended to use about 30 millilitres / 1.01 fl. oz) for a large coffee.

, Your machine should have a dosing spoon to measure out the coffee. For a single shot of espresso you will need one spoonful of coffee (7 grams / .25 oz), and for a double shot you will need 2 spoonfuls (14 grams / .5 oz). Put the correct amount in the filter basket and tap it to create a level surface. Use the tamper provided to compact the coffee. This will ensure the water doesn't flow through it too quickly.

, Lock the group handle into the machine and put the cup underneath. Turn on the dosage button. The coffee should take 14-18 seconds to filter through for a single espresso and 20-25 seconds for a double, after which you should turn off the dosage button.

Add spices directly to your coffee grounds.,
Store your coffee beans along with spices.,
Make flavored simple syrups at home.,
Add flavorful extracts directly to your cup.",How to Flavor Coffee Naturally," This is a simple, natural, and often calorie-free way to add flavor to your cup of coffee. Spices like cinnamon, cardamom, and nutmeg can be sprinkled directly over the coffee grounds in your coffee brewer. When the water passes through the grounds, it will extract the flavor of the spices into your cup.;
, Another way to add a favorite spice or herb's flavor to your coffee is by storing your coffee beans with the whole spices. Mix whole nutmeg, cloves, sticks of cinnamon, or other spices into your coffee beans. As you scoop each day's portion of beans out for grinding, you will notice the flavor of the spices slowly infusing directly into the beans, with the flavor becoming more pronounced each day.

, The flavors added at most specialty coffee shops are processed, bottled forms of simple syrups - a mixture of water and sugar. You can easily make your own simple syrup at home, adding in herbs and spices to produce any flavor you like.


Start by bringing equal volumes of water and sugar to a simmer in a saucepan. Stir until all the sugar has dissolved. This is the base of your flavored simple syrup.
To your base syrup, add any herbs and spices that you like, allowing them to simmer gently for 10 or 20 minutes. Possible flavors include vanilla bean, fresh rosemary, orange peel, clove, star anise, and even dried fruit.
The finished simple syrup can be stored in the refrigerator for several weeks. Add it to your coffee by the spoonful until it is sweetened and flavored to taste.

, Another simple way to flavor coffee naturally is by adding a few drops of plant extracts or essential oils to your coffee cup. Vanilla, orange, and mint extracts are possible options that are easy to find in a grocery store. Add these liquids to your coffee cup by the drop, as the flavor can become intense with only a small volume.

Combine the espresso and milk.,
Garnish and serve.",How to Make a Caffe Mocha1," You'll need about 3 tablespoons (22 g) of sweetened cocoa powder or 2 tablespoons of syrup to make an 8 ounce (236 ml) mocha. You can either place the chocolate into the mug you'll be serving the mocha in or put it into a metal steaming pitcher with your milk. Measure about 10 to 12 (295 to 355 ml) ounces of milk into the pitcher if you're going to make an 8 ounce (236 ml) mocha.You can also put the chocolate into a tiny metal pitcher. This way, you can pull the espresso shot directly into the chocolate which will help it dissolve. This is useful if you'll be making an iced mocha and can't steam the chocolate with the milk.;
, To make a double shot, place 15 grams of espresso grounds in a clean portafilter. Tamp it down so that it packs the grounds evenly. This will ensure that water passes through it evenly. Lock the group handle into the espresso machine and place a small metal pitcher underneath. Turn on the espresso machine to pull the shot. It should take about 20 to 25 seconds for the shot to pull through.It's important to weigh out your espresso grounds. If you don't have enough grounds, your espresso will filter through too quickly and taste weak.
Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for your espresso machine. Adding too many grounds to the portafilter could damage the machine.

, Turn on the steam wand on your espresso machine for a few seconds to clean it out before you steam the milk. Insert the steam wand into the metal pitcher of milk and turn on the steam wand. Keep the wand towards the bottom of the jug and only bring it near the surface of the milk a few times to make foam. Heat your milk between 140 and 160 degrees F (60 to 71 degrees Celsius).Clean the steam wand with a wet cloth and turn it on for a few seconds to clear any milk out of the tube.


You can either insert a thermometer into the milk while you're steaming or hold you hand on the side of the pitcher as you steam. Once the pitcher becomes too hot to touch, move your hand away and continue to steam the milk for a few more seconds.

, If you steamed the milk with chocolate in the pitcher, you'll simply need to pour the hot chocolate over your espresso shots in your mug. If you placed the chocolate in the mug or a small silver pitcher, you'll need to stir the chocolate with the espresso to dissolve it. Slowly pour the hot milk over your coffee and chocolate mixture.


You can thoroughly stir the mixture or practice pouring an intricate design. To pour a design, place the espresso in your mug and carefully pour your hot chocolate over it so that it doesn't break the surface of the espresso. Wiggle your your wrist back and forth to create a rosetta pattern.

, Most coffee shops top caffe mochas with whipped cream. This is an easy way to add extra creaminess and style to your drink. You can also sprinkle sweetened cocoa powder over the top or drizzle chocolate syrup over it.Or, you could top it with mini marshmallows.


If you garnish with whipped cream, don't forget to leave about an inch of space at the top of your mug. Otherwise, your mug may overflow as the whipped cream melts.

Remove the cold pitcher and pour in cold milk until it reaches the bottom of the spout. This will give the milk room to expand and foam as it heats.For example, if you have a 12-ounce (355 ml) pitcher, pour in about 10 ounces (295 ml) of milk.
Because of its high fat content, whole milk is easier to steam than skim or low-fat milk.;
, Point the steam wand away from you and turn it completely on for a few seconds. This will clean the wand of any milk that may be stuck in the wand. Turn it off and immediately lower it towards the bottom of the pitcher.The steam wand should be pointing diagonally towards the back of the pitcher near the handle.

, Turn the steam wand on as soon as you've lowered it into the milk. If you want to check the temperature of the milk, insert a thermometer onto the side of the pitcher. Slowly bring the wand up in the milk so it's near the top. The milk should be swirling like a whirlpool., Lower the steam wand back down so it's about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) away from the top of the milk. The milk should not stretch too much nor should there be any big bubbles. This will create smooth, velvety microfoam instead of dry, stiff foam.The microfoam is steamed milk that is made up of many tiny bubbles. This makes a softly textured milk that's easy to pour into art.
Keep in mind that the milk will continue to heat for a little bit after you've turned off the steam wand. Avoid overheating the milk or you'll increase the risk of burning yourself.
Once you get used to steaming milk, you probably won't need the thermometer. With a little experience you can usually tell how hot the milk is by just feeling the temperature of the pitcher.

, Shut off the steam and take the thermometer out of the steam pitcher. Tap the pitcher of foamed milk on the counter and then swirl the milk gently to prepare it for pouring.Swirling the milk will get rid of any big bubbles in the foam that could make it hard to pour.

, Take a wet cloth and thoroughly wipe the steam wand as soon as you've finished heating the milk. Purge the steam wand by turning it completely on for a few seconds. This will clear out any milk that's been left inside the wand.Remember to wipe off the thermometer, if you used one.

, Measure about 7 to 8 grams of espresso for each shot into a clean portafilter. Use the tamp to press down evenly on the grounds so you're giving it about 30 to 40 pounds (13 to 18 kg) of pressure. Avoid leaving the tamped espresso to sit for very long in the portafilter, especially if the portafilter is hot. This could burn the espresso.You can practice pushing down on a bathroom scale to figure out how hard to press down on the portafilter.

, Immediately put the portafilter into the espresso machine and turn it on. It will take a few seconds before the espresso begins to drip out of the machine into your shot glass or small pitcher. Give the double shot about 21 to 24 seconds before you turn it off. You should notice a creamy foam at the top of the shot. This is the crema.With a little practice, you should be able to start the espresso and steam the milk at the same time. This will ensure that neither the espresso nor steamed milk sit for long.

, You may need to practice just pulling shots of espresso before you make latte art. If you find that the espresso is taking too long to get into the cup, you may have packed the portafilter too tightly. Or if the espresso immediately pours into the cup once you start the shot, you may need to tamp down harder or use more espresso., Slowly pour the espresso shots into a wide-mouthed serving cup or mug to keep the crema on top. The crema is what will make your latte art really stand out. If you let the shot sit for too long (more than 10 seconds) before you pour in the steamed milk, you won't get much definition in your designs.A wide-mouthed cup will give you more space for your latte art.

, Hold the wide-mouthed cup with the espresso in your non-dominant hand. Tilt the cup about 20 degrees towards the pitcher of milk that you're holding in the other hand. Slowly pour steamed milk directly into the espresso until the cup is about halfway full.

The goal is to keep the rich crema floating on top. If you pour too quickly, it can wash out the espresso which will make it difficult to create latte art.

, Once the cup is half full, you can tilt the wide-mouthed cup back until it's straight up. At the same time, move the pitcher of steamed milk right above the surface of the espresso. You should see some of the white microfoam appear in the espresso. You can now start making a design., Once you see the white dot of microfoam in the cup, keep pouring right into it. You should get a large white circle. When you've almost filled the cup, pour the milk through the white circle towards the other side of the cup. This pulls the milk through the circle to create the heart shape.Remember that you're moving the milk and the pitcher, not the cup with the espresso.
If the milk is too dry or stiff, you'll may end up with more of a white blob. Try it again and steam the milk so it's looser.

, Stop pouring the foamed milk as soon as you see the white dot against the crema. Wait a second and then pour another dot right behind the first dot. Continue making as many dots as you like until you're ready to pour the milk through the dots. This will connect all of them and make the dots look like leaves.You're basically making a little heart from the final dot. The end of the heart becomes the stem for the flower.

, As soon as you see the white dot of microfoam in the crema, use your wrist to gently rock the milk from side to side as you pour it into the cup. The white microfoam should begin to fan out. Continue rocking the milk until the cup is almost full and the design is almost covering the top of the cup. Lift the milk pitcher up a little and pour directly through the milk towards the other side of the cup.Avoid using your whole arm to rock the milk into the cup. This will give you less control over the design.

, Take a toothpick or skewer and drag it through the foam on the top of the latte to create your own patterns or art. This works well even if your foam isn't made of delicate microfoam. You can even use etching to create words in the foam.


Consider drizzling a syrup over the top of the foam before you drag the toothpick through it. This can create a web-like effect or allow you to write words easier.

, You can buy stencils that you simply place over the finished latte. Shake cocoa powder, cinnamon, or a spice mix over the stencil and lift away the stencil. This will leave the image of the stencil on top of the latte.You can make your own latte stencil using thin plastic or wax paper. Use a blade to carefully cut away the design you want into the plastic. You can set this over the latte like a stencil.

, For a unique design, sprinkle some cocoa powder over the espresso in the cup before you pour the milk into it. When you pour the milk over it, the latte will look darkly speckled. You can also make swirls in the foam using chocolate syrup.

Experiment by drawing webs, snowflakes, or flowers using chocolate syrup.

Brew the coffee.,
Prepare the chocolate.,
Heat the milk.,
Combine the mocha.,
Froth extra milk.,
Garnish and serve.",How to Make a Caffe Mocha2," Fill your coffee maker with cool filtered water and place coffee grounds in the filter basket. Don't forget to put a filter in the basket if your machine doesn't use a metal mesh filter. Turn the machine on to brew your coffee.


While you can brew as much coffee as you like, try to use the following coffee to water ratio:2 tablespoons (10.6 g) of ground coffee for every 6 ounces (177 ml) of water.

, If you're using chocolate syrup, pour about 1 1/2 ounces (45 ml) of chocolate syrup into the mug you'll be serving the mocha in. If you're using a sweetened cocoa powder, place about 3 tablespoons (22 g) of the powder into the mug you'll be using for the mocha.If you're unsure how sweet you like your mocha, prepare the mocha using less chocolate. If you find that you'd like it sweeter, you can drizzle chocolate syrup or sprinkle chocolate powder over the top.

, Pour a cup of milk into a small saucepan and heat it over medium heat on the stove. You should see small bubbles start to line the sides of the pan when the milk is hot enough.Avoid boiling or scalding the milk. This would make your mocha taste bitter.


You can also heat the milk in the microwave. Pour your milk into the mug that contains the chocolate and microwave for at least a minute. Fill the mug only 2/3 full so that you have room to add your drip coffee.

, Pour hot drip coffee over the chocolate syrup or powder in your mug. You can add as much coffee as you like, keeping in mind that if you add mostly coffee, you won't have much room for the hot milk. Stir this mixture to dissolve the chocolate and slowly pour in the milk.If you like a creamier mocha, only fill your mug about 1/3 of the way with coffee before filling it the rest of the way with hot milk.

, If you'd like foam on top of your mocha, use a battery powdered milk frother. Pour additional hot milk into a separate mug that has high sides. The milk should only come about 1/3 of the way up the side. Insert the foamer and steam the milk until it becomes a thick foam. Scoop this foam on top of your mocha.You can also foam milk using a jar and the microwave. Pour milk in a mason jar so that it fills it halfway. Tightly screw on the lid and shake the jar hard for up to 1 minute so that the milk doubles in volume. Remove the lid and microwave the milk for 30 seconds. Take the jar out of the microwave and scoop off the foam for use on your mocha., If you'd like to add an extra creamy flavor to your mocha, top it with whipped cream. For a more stylish presentation, sprinkle sweetened cocoa powder over the top. Some coffee shops will place a stencil over the top and sprinkle the powder over it to create a design. You could also drizzle chocolate syrup over your mocha.Or, you could top it with mini marshmallows.


If you garnish with whipped cream, don't forget to leave about an inch of space at the top of your mug. This will prevent your mocha from overflowing as the whipped cream melts.

Include a spice or herb.,
Add a scoop of ice cream.,
Ice your mocha.,
Use a different chocolate.,
Add a different flavor.,
Change the milk you use.",How to Make a Caffe Mocha3," Experiment with flavors by adding spices you enjoy to your mocha. Mexican mochas are popular flavored mochas that include cinnamon and a bit of chili powder.You can also try adding a dash of:


Ground cardamom
Ground lavender
Cayenne powder

, While whipped cream is a common topping, you could top your mocha with something more fun. Add a scoop of vanilla or chocolate ice cream. Not only will this cool your mocha so you can drink it faster, but it will also make the drink richer and creamier.


Consider sprinkling chocolate shavings over the ice cream or whipped cream.
Use coffee ice cream if you really want to taste the espresso or coffee flavor in your mocha.

, If you're not in the mood for a hot beverage, prepare an iced caffe mocha. To do this with an espresso machine, combine your espresso and chocolate syrup. Stir it into cold milk and pour the mixture into a cup filled with ice. Play around with the ratio of milk to coffee and chocolate until you find a combination you enjoy.


If you're using drip coffee, combine the chocolate powder or syrup with brewed coffee and refrigerate the mixture until it's very cold.Pour it into a cup filled with ice and add milk or cream if you like.

, Most mochas use either a cocoa powder or a syrup made from cocoa powder. This creates a dark-colored and rich tasting mocha. You could try using a milk or white chocolate syrup, especially if you like a sweeter mocha. Choose a chocolate syrup that lists chocolate (or cocoa butter, if buying white chocolate) as one of the first ingredients.


If you want to add additional cream, use a ganache. Chocolate ganache is a mixture of chocolate and cream that can be thinned into a syrup or scooped and heated with coffee or milk., The chocolate flavor in a caffe mocha pairs well with many other flavors. Play around with adding other flavors to see what flavor combinations you like. Just keep in mind that you may want to reduce the amount of chocolate syrup or powder you're using since you'll be adding another sugary syrup. Syrup flavors that go well with chocolate include:


Caramel
Mint
Hazelnut
Orange
Almond

, Most coffee shops automatically use milk when preparing mochas. But, if you're lactose-intolerant or just looking for a unique flavor, make your caffe mocha using a dairy alternative like coconut, hemp, soy, or almond milk. Just be aware that they may steam or foam differently than cow's milk.


If you want to use cow's milk, realize that skim or low-fat milks won't be as creamy as a full-fat milk. It's easier to use a full-fat milk if you're steaming it for foam."

Assemble your ingredients and tools:


French Press.,
Lift the lid/filter assembly out of the pot.,
Heat your water.,
Grind your beans.,
Add your grounds to your press.,
Pour a splash of near boiling water over the grounds.,
Stir your brew.,
Steep your brew.,
Press your brew.,
Let your brew set briefly before pouring.",How to Make Espresso Beverages With a French Press1,"
Freshly ground coffee beans ground to espresso setting.
Measuring spoon.
Stirring stick.
Hot water.;
, This is the top of your French press that is comprised of the lid and a rod that screws into the mesh filter.


The mesh filter and the plunger is what you will press down on the coffee grounds and water. The filter separates the grounds from your beverage for drinking. Make sure it is pulled up when you remove it.

, Using a stovetop safe kettle, heat your water.


As your kettle begins to heat the water, warm the glass container of your French press by swirling some hot water in it. Adding a bit of warm water ensures the glass won’t crack from the sudden temperature change when you add boiling water later.

, The grind of your beans is going to be a large factor in how close you get to having a drink that resembles an espresso. If you are buying ground beans, then look for an espresso grind.


If you are grinding your own beans, still look for coffee that says ""espresso beans"" or ""espresso"". While there is no actual espresso type of bean, often commercial roasters will have an espresso bean. This will give you a taste and consistency to which you are used to because it is roasted to bring out the espresso flavor.
If you grind your own beans, you will want a grinder that can offer you an espresso grind. Burr grinders are grinders which actually grind the beans between two burrs. These grinders crunch up a few beans at a time and grind the bean into a nice even powder.
Blade grinders can be effective as well. However, with a blade grinder, you’re using a sharp propeller to chop the beans. This method can be less consistent. The espresso ground is very fine. It is finer than what you would have if you were grinding beans for a regular French press or a drip coffee maker. The fine ground contributes to the flavor and ability to mix with the hot pressure of water. You don’t want an espresso grind to be so fine that it goes through your filter. The problem with this fine of a grind in a French press is that the filter has a larger mesh. It should be like sand. You may then want to make your grind slightly more coarse, but not much. Unless you don’t mind a bit of grounds in the bottom of your cup.

, Pour roughly 36 grams (1.3 oz) of grounds into your press.


This part is a bit tricky because you are trying to make espresso. Which when prepared in an espresso machine uses about 16-21 grams of grounds per 1 cup of water. Since your French press is larger, try doubling your proportions. You’ll have some espresso left over but that’s ok.

, Then after a few seconds add the remainder of your two cups of water.


Your water should not exceed 200° F, around 195° F is ideal.
Before pouring in your full two cups of water, just add a splash to let the grounds flour and bloom. This will open the grounds up and let the flavors really come out.

, Give the brew a quick stir with a long-handled spoon to prevent clumps and add a nice frothy consistency. Then push the lid/filter assembly down until it just rests on the water.


Don’t plunge your filter down yet. You need to let the coffee steep.

, Let it steep until the coffee is is very dark (about 3-4 minutes).


The longer you steep, the stronger your coffee will be. However, this does not mean that you should steep your espresso too long just to get a stronger, more espresso-like flavor.
Steeping is another area for experimentation. Just be aware of one rule: The length of steep time controls extraction. Too short and the coffee will be under-extracted and sour; too long and the coffee will be over-extracted and bitter.

, Hold the lid to steady and press the plunger down slowly in a steady, even manner until it stops.


You may want to experiment with plunging halfway, bringing it up, and then plunging it down all the way to create a thin layer of foam.

, Pour your coffee through a clean cloth or a coffee filter if you want to catch any of the very fine sediment.


Note that pouring through a paper filter will alter the consistency and flavor of your drink slightly. The paper will catch some of the texture of your drink, and possibly transfer an oily essence as your coffee steeps through.

Heat the milk until it is warmed through. You don’t want your milk to boil. Heat just until it starts to bubble then turn the stove off.
The thicker the milk or cream you use, the thicker your foam will be. However, using 2% or low-fat milk may be easier if you are frothing by hand. Lower-fat milks usually include whey proteins that are critical stabilizers for milk foam.

, While the milk is being heated, make your espresso using the first method.


You can also heat the milk while the beverage is steeping.

, Do this while the coffee is steeping.


Place the pan on a towel or surface that isn’t hot but that won’t get damaged by the heat from the pan.

, Angle your pot and set an immersion blender in the shallow end of the pot. Froth the milk on high speed until the foam holds, about 2 to 3 minutes blending on high.


If you don’t have an immersion blender, you can use a whisk and stir the milk in a smaller container. Stir by rotating the whisk back and forth between the palms of your hands. Stir until your milk is bubbly and frothy.

, Once you’ve poured your milk, tighten the lid and give the jar a good shake. Don’t fill the jar more than halfway. This won’t leave enough room for the milk to foam.
Shake until the milk is bubbly and nice and foamy. You should be shaking for about 30 to 60 seconds.
Then microwave the jar (making sure you have a microwave safe jar) for about 30 seconds. This allows the foam to rise to the top.

, Divide the coffee out amongst the cups and spoon the frothed milk on top of each. Serve immediately.

Mix with alcohol or food.",How to Drink Espresso1," Espresso aficionados love to follow rituals in their espresso drinking, and to argue over which method is superior. Many common opinions and methods are described below, but even experts can't agree on which of these is ""best.""


If you want to test multiple methods in one sitting, cleanse your palate with water before each shot.;
, Put the cup to your nose and inhale the aroma with a long, slow draw. Scent is a major part of flavor.

, The light brown ""crema"" layer is the most bitter part of the drink, so ""beginner"" espresso drinkers often don't want to taste it straight. Here are a few approaches, all of them used by at least some ""expert"" drinkers:


Stir the crema in with a spoon or swirl the cup in a circle to mix it in with the rest of the espresso. (Don't lick the spoon if you don't want the bitter plain crema taste.)
Sip the crema for a bitter blast to start out. Some people then stir the remaining crema in, but more proceed to drink the rest with the crema still separated.
Skim the crema off and discard. This option may horrify traditionalists, but even some chefs prefer the sweeter, lighter, more evenly textured drink that results., The espresso flavor begins to change (some would say deteriorate) within 15 to 30 seconds of extraction, and the crema begins to dissolve into the cup. Drinking the shot in one or two swallows is worth trying at least once to see how the flavor changes, but expect an extremely intense punch.


Test the temperature of the drink before trying this.
You may want to sip the crema or a crema-liquid mixture for a different flavor to begin with.

, To discover the changing nuances of flavor throughout a cup of espresso, sip the drink without stirring. For a more consistent taste, stir before sipping. Either way, try to finish the espresso before it cools. Cooling will alter the espresso's flavors, or make different notes more noticeable, but this is almost always a negative effect once the drink drops near room temperature.Try stirring and sipping an espresso doppio, or double-sized shot, for a different balance of top and bottom layers., This step is intentionally listed after the plain espresso methods, since most espresso fans dislike adding ingredients to the drink. Try adding a touch of sweetness to a low-quality espresso, or when you're starting out in the espresso world and need to be weaned away from sweeter coffee drinks.

, Some cafés serve espresso with a small glass of sparkling water on the side. Sip this before drinking the espresso to cleanse your palate. Only drink the water after the espresso is finished if you dislike the flavor – and do so out of range of the barista.Recently, a few locations have started making ""carbonated coffee""... but be prepared for strange looks if you try to recreate this yourself., Italian cafés occasionally serve espresso with a piece of chocolate. Avoid other strongly flavored accompaniments, especially biscuits or cookies.Of course, espresso is often served alone.


For espresso tasting sessions, serve unsalted crackers and still water to cleanse the palate between shots.

, Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream to your espresso to make affogato. Bolster your espresso with vodka or coffee liquer, or add it to a coffee cake recipe instead of instant coffee. Of course, you can stay in the café world with more complex espresso drinks, such as a latté, mocha, or cappuccino.

Invest in an inexpensive stove-top espresso maker, namely, the ""macchinetta"".,
Take a quick look at the machinetta.,
Note that in most macchinettas, the Top Chamber, Central Column and Filter Plate are combined in one piece, the Funnel Filter is a separate piece, and the Steam Release Valve and Bottom Chamber are combined in one piece.

,
Use excellent quality coffee grounds.,
Fill the bottom chamber up to the steam release valve with cold water.

,
Insert the funnel filter.,
Once the water is at the appropriate level and the funnel filter has been inserted, fill the funnel with your coffee grounds.,
Take the upper part of the machinetta and turn it upside down and inspect the filter and gasket.,
Place the macchinetta on the stove top.,
Wait.,
Allow the process to complete.",How to Brew Authentic Italian Caffe," Proper hardware is a must to brew a great cup of coffee.;
, Macchinettas are composed of 6 parts:


Top Chamber
Central Column
Filter Plate
Funnel Filter
Steam Release Valve
Bottom Chamber

,, To be specific, only use coffee grounds specifically labeled as ""espresso ground coffee"". Ask at your coffee specialist store for good recommendations.

,, If the water starts to fill the funnel filter area, you will need to remove some water. You want the water to almost start to fill the filter but not actually start. This might take you a couple of turns.

, Regardless of what size machinetta you are using, you will want to fill the funnel so that the coffee grounds form a nice dome. You will know you have the right amount when you cannot add any more without some spilling off. Do not tamp or compact the grounds.

, If there are any obstructions or old grounds, clear them out. After verifying that the upper part is okay, turn it back over and screw it on to the bottom of the macchinetta. Ensure you have a good seal. If you do not screw it on tightly enough, you will end up with a big mess, and if you screw it on too tightly, it will be very hard to take the macchinetta apart to clean.

, When applying heat, the hotter the stove the more bitter the Italian caffe will be. Try to find an acceptable compromise between too hot and cooler and too slow.

, As the water in the bottom chamber begins to boil the water passes through the grounds, up the central column, and into the upper chamber. When the water in the bottom chamber is close to being completely transferred to the upper chamber you will start to hear a gurgling sound. Wait 15 seconds after you first hear the gurgling noise and then remove the machinetta from the heat.

, The Italian caffe will continue to percolate for up to 30 seconds. After this you should have an outstanding batch of coffee!

Know how an espresso is made.,
Watch the color and thickness of the crema.,
Smell and taste the dark espresso liquid.,
Evaluate the finish.",How to Drink Espresso2," Espresso is made by forcing hot, high-pressure water through freshly-ground coffee beans, yielding a small amount of liquid, about ¾ to 1 ½ oz liquid. A proper espresso is made from coffee beans that have been roasted medium-dark or darker, ground to a fine consistency, and packed evenly into an espresso basket.While there is an endless variety of espresso preferences and traditions, these basic properties define the drink. If your drink fills an ordinary coffee cup, was made from coarse-ground beans, or went through an ordinary coffee filter, it is not a typical espresso.


An ""espresso macchiato"" adds a small amount of milk or milk foam atop the drink.

, A light brown, frothy layer tops the surface of a properly made espresso. This ""crema"" is a rapidly evaporating compound of coffee oils and solids, not found in any other coffee drink. Thicker, redder crema, with flecks of copper or dark gold, suggests the espresso was ""pulled"" perfectly.The crema dissolves quickly after creation, so an espresso served without a crema may have sat out a couple minutes, or may not have achieved enough pressure.

, The ""body"" of the shot is a dark, thick layer of liquid beneath the crema. This is much stronger than an ordinary cup of coffee, and should leave a complex aftertaste combining bitter, sweet, acidic, and even creamy flavors. If it has a one-dimensional bitter flavor, the beans may have been roasted too dark. Try another café or homemade method, and you'll find a different interpretation of espresso.

, The lowest layer of the espresso, not visually distinct from the body above, is thicker and sweeter, even syrup-like. You may or may not enjoy this on its own – many people stir these layers together – but an unstirred cup without a thick base is a thin, inadequately prepared espresso.


Espresso should have few if any particles of grounds, but you may want to sip the end of the cup through your teeth if your espresso maker doesn't meet these standards. (If the beans are ground to a powder consistency and intentionally poured into the cup, you're drinking ""Turkish coffee."")

, Keep stirring until the mixture turns thick and syrupy. If you want a less-sweet latte, you can use less sugar.








, Allow the mixture to heat back up, but don't let it come to a boil.









This will make the latte taste more syrupy, like what you'd find in a coffee shop. For something less sweet, use only 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of vanilla extract.
Stir the ingredients continuously to prevent the milk from scalding.
The type of milk you use is up to you. Whole milk will produce the most rich taste and the most froth, but nonfat milk will also become frothy enough to work with and will produce a slightly healthier drink.

, Keep blending until the mixture turns foamy. This will take about 15 to 30 seconds. You can also use a regular blender or food processor, but be sure to hold the lid down tightly and to wrap towels around it. If you don't do this, the mixture will leak out.









If you don't have any kind of blender, process the mixture with a whisk. It won't be as smooth, however, and you may still have some pumpkin puree in the finished drink.
The mixture should become very foamy. Expect more foam if you used whole milk and less if you used low-fat or nonfat milk.

To really milk the mango for all it's worth, once you think you have as much of it off the pit as possible, grab the pit and the skin and wring it up and down with your hands. Sure, your hands will get covered and sticky, but you'll get every last milliliter of juice you can.;

Serve and enjoy!",How to Make a Rainbow Smoothie," To make a rainbow smoothie, you need to blend different combinations of fruit together to make the different colored layers. So along with your ingredients, you'll also need:


Seven sealable freezer bags or freezer-safe bowls with airtight lids.
Sharp knife and flat surface for preparing the fruit.
Strainer for draining the washed berries.
Blender and a mixing spoon.
Five large cups. Alternatively, you can pour one smoothie and freeze the rest of the prepared fruit for later. This recipe makes about 12.5 cups (3 L) of smoothie, or five 2.5-cup (591 ml) servings;
, As you prepare the fruit, it’s important to keep it all separated until your ready to combine the ingredients for the different layers. To wash and cut the fruit:


Peel the bananas and orange. Leave the bananas whole. Chop the orange into one-inch (2.5-cm) chunks.
Wash the raspberries under running water and place them in a strainer to dry off. Repeat with the blueberries, spinach, and strawberries. Cut the stems off the strawberries.
Wash the peach and cut it in half to remove the pit. Cut the peach into quarters.
Wash the beet and cut off the tail and the stem. Cut the beet into quarters.
Peel the pineapple and mango. Cut the fruit from around the core of the pineapple and the pit of the mango. Cut the fruit into one-inch (2.5-cm) chunks.

, This rainbow smoothie will have seven layers in total: purple, blue, red, magenta, green, yellow, and orange. Place the fruit bunches into separate freezer bags once it’s all divided out.


Purple layer: combine half a banana and the blueberries. You can also substitute mixed berries or blackberries. As you portion out the bananas for the different layers, cut them into one-inch (2.5-cm) chunks.Blue layer: one banana and ½ cup (82.5 g) of pineapple. You will use the food coloring to turn this blue.
Red layer: half a banana, and ¼ cup each of raspberries (31.25 g) and strawberries (50 g).
Magenta layer: half a banana, the beet, and ¼ cup each of raspberries (31.25 g) and strawberries (50 g).
Green layer: one banana, the spinach, and ½ cup (82.5 g) of pineapple. For a more vibrant green, add ¼ of an avocado as well.Yellow layer: one banana and ½ cup (82.5 g) of pineapple.
Orange layer: half a banana, the peach, the orange, and the mango.

, It's important to start with frozen fruit, because this will give the smoothies the right consistency and help the layers stay separated. You can add lots of ice to a regular smoothie, but that will dilute the colors.


Once all the fruit is divided and portioned into bags or bowls, place it in the freezer for a few hours or overnight., To make each smoothie layer, you will also need yogurt and orange juice, or another liquid for blending. Keep these ingredients cold and in the fridge until you're ready to assemble your smoothie.


You can use Greek, regular, coconut, or soy yogurt for the smoothies. Each smoothie color will require ¼ cup (61 g) of yogurt.
Good blending liquids for the smoothies include coconut milk, water, and dairy or non-dairy milk. Each smoothie color will require about 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of liquid.

, To make an accurate rainbow, start with magenta on the bottom, followed by purple, blue, green, yellow, orange, and finally red on top.


In the bottom of the blender, pour in ¼ cup (61 g) of yogurt and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of orange juice. Then add the fruit for the magenta layer, which is banana, beet, raspberries, and strawberries.Always add the liquids to the blender first, as this will prevent air bubbles from forming.
When you start up the blender, start on a low speed. As the fruit chunks get smaller, increase the speed until the mixture is smooth and free of chunks.
As you blend, add more orange juice if you need to loosen up the fruit. You can also turn off and unplug the blender to stir the smoothie if necessary.

, Place ¼ to 1/3 cup of magenta smoothie into the bottom of each glass. You want about the same quantity of each color per smoothie, which will work out to roughly a one-inch (2.5-cm) layer of each color. To make even and flat layers, pack the smoothie layer down with the spoon. Place the glasses into the freezer until you're ready to add another layer.If you're only making one smoothie, pour the remaining magenta smoothie back into the freezer bag and save it for later.
When the blender is empty, rinse it out with warm water so that you don’t mix colors making your next layer., Make the purple layer next by adding the yogurt, juice, and fruit. Repeat using the same process as you did for the magenta layer. When you're ready to pour, remove the glasses from the freezer and spoon in a one-inch (2.5-cm) thick layer (on top of the magenta.) Pack it down and return the cup to the freezer.


When you're making the blue layer, don’t forget to add the food coloring, otherwise you'll have another layer of yellow. The food coloring is necessary because blue fruits, such as blueberries, actually turn purple when blended.
If you don’t want to use artificial food coloring, you can find natural food coloring, or skip the blue layer.

, Leave the individual fruit combinations in the freezer until you're ready to make that layer. This will help keep the fruit layers frozen, which will keep the colors from blending together. For each fruit layer:


Add the yogurt and orange juice first.
Blend the mixture until smooth, adding more liquid if necessary.
Remove the glasses from the freezer and spoon in a one-inch layer of smoothie on top of the previous layer.
Return the glasses to the freezer until you add the next layer. Place any unused smoothie back into the freezer.
Rinse out the blender.

, You can serve the smoothies with either a spoon or a straw. As long as you keep the leftover fruit colors separate in the freezer, you can easily make more rainbow smoothies another day.

The ice will only dilute the smoothie, making it less flavorful. Using frozen fruit in your smoothie will result in a smoothie that is still thick and cold, but it won't make it watery.;
, Start off by laying the strawberries on their sides. Using a sharp knife, slice the tops off. Then, set them down on the sliced side. Cut them straight down, creating two half-cones.


If the recipe calls for frozen strawberries, cut the strawberries the night before, scoop the slices into a plastic, re-sealable bag, and toss them into the freezer.

, Cut the banana into ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) thick slices.


If the recipe calls for frozen bananas, cut the banana the night before, place the slices into a plastic, re-sealable bag, and toss them into the freezer.

, Using raw, oatmeal in your smoothie will not harm you, but cooked oatmeal will give your smoothie a more creamy texture. Cook it the night before so that it has time to cool down before you add it to the smoothie.

, You won't be pouring your milk in all at once. Instead, you will be pouring in half of your milk first, then adding the rest of your ingredients. The rest of the milk will go into the blender at the very end. This helps blend things more evenly in your smoothie., Strawberries and bananas are healthy enough themselves, but you can give your smoothie an additional boost by adding other ingredients, such as cacao powder, chia seeds, and wheat grass. Refer to the section in this article on customizing your smoothie with extra ingredients for more suggestions.

, If you do not have a blender, you can use a food processor instead.

, Save the rest of your milk for the very end.

, If the recipe you are using calls for dry ingredients, such as flax seed and oatmeal, pour them in now. If you cooked your oatmeal the night before, you can add it in at this point as well.

, If you wish to add a little protein to your smoothie, you can add in one tablespoon of peanut butter.


If you do not like peanut butter or are allergic to it, but still want a sweet-tasting smoothie, opt for 1 tablespoon of honey instead.

, Do not worry if the fruit is not evenly-sliced. It will get all blended together. The frozen fruit will not only help thicken your smoothie, but keep it cool as well.

, Take the remaining milk, and pour it over the fruit.

, Put the lid onto the blender, and turn the blender on. Start at a low speed, then progress to a higher speed.


If the ingredients are clumping up on the sides of the blender, they probably aren't blending properly. Simply stop the blender and open the lid. Stir the ingredients inside with a spatula, making sure to knock any clumps of fruit off the sides of the mixing container. Replace the lid and turn the blender back on.

, Once everything has blended, stop the blender, take off the lid, and pour everything into a tall glass. You can use a spatula to help guide everything into the cup. Be sure to scrape any smoothie off the sides of the mixing container so that nothing goes to waste.

, It is full of antioxidants, which help you stay healthy and prevent you from getting sick. It is also rich in magnesium, iron, and potassium. , Chia seeds not only help thicken up a smoothie, but they also have plenty of protein and trace minerals., If you want to water down your smoothie without sacrificing flavor, add a splash of coconut water. Not only will it give you a tropical twist, but it is also good for hydration. It also contains potassium and electrolytes., Flax seed is a fiber, which is good for digestive health and helping relieve constipation. It can also help reduce heart disease by lowering blood cholesterol., A pinch of raw, grated ginger will help ease digestive issues, such as stomachaches and heartburn. It will also help ease the pain associated with menstrual cramps., If your smoothie isn't sweet enough for you, pass the sugar and reach for the honey instead. It is just as sweet, but has the antioxidants that sugar does not!

, Add 1 to 2 cups (75 to 150 grams)of kale to your smoothie for additional health benefits. Packed with vitamins and antioxidants, kale is great for fighting off disease and boosting the immune system.It also helps prevent cancer and diabetes. (It will also turn your smoothie an exciting green color!)

, Oatmeal is good for making you feel filler with fewer calories. They also have plenty of fiber and protein. Lastly, they also have the ability to absorb excess fat.

Choose from spinach, kale, collards, romaine, Swiss chard, and dandelion, just to name a few. These provide the nutritional base of the smoothie., Liquids are important with a smoothie. If you don't add a liquid, your smoothie will be much too thick. You can use something as simple as a cup of water. However, you can also use almond milk or soy milk,as well as coconut milk or water.You can even use regular milk or coffee.Use the same amount of liquid as you use greens, 1 cup (237 milliliters).

, Fruits give the smoothie flavor and sweetness, and they also add additional nutrients. You can use any combination of fruit you want, including bananas, strawberries, blueberries, mango, orange, apple, pineapple, and avocado.You'll need about 1 1/2 cups (355 milliliters) of fruit.
Consider adding both a creamy fruit and a flavorful fruit. For instance, avocado, banana, and mango are all creamy, while orange, pineapple, and strawberry add a punch of flavor.Frozen fruit is a great addition to smoothies. It's cheap, and you can just throw it in frozen. However, be sure to use about equal parts frozen and fresh fruit, as you don't want your smoothie too cold or thick., You can also add power-house toppings for other nutrients and protein. For instance, you can use chia seeds, flax seeds, almond butter, hemp seeds, or acai powder. Add a dash of cinnamon or cocoa powder for flavor.You can also use oats that have soaked overnight or fresh ginger.
Cardamom, nutmeg, and tumeric can all add nice flavors. Don't forget a small dash of salt to brighten flavors., You can really use any sweetener you want, if you prefer your smoothie a little sweeter. You can add honey, agave syrup, monk fruit sugar, regular white sugar, stevia, or even just a splash of fruit juice. You'll need to do sweeteners to taste, as it's really up to you how sweet you want it.

, The liquid goes in first so that everything else has something to blend in. Pour it in the blender, and then add all the other ingredients on top of it. Remember, your liquid and greens will be a one-to-one ration, so you'll need about a cup of liquid if you're using a cup of greens., Chopping up your produce may seem counter-intuitive when you're about to blend it up. However, if you don't have a very powerful blender, this step will help you get all the bits blended up easier. Chop them into about 1-inch (about 2 1/2 centimeters) pieces or smaller., The fresh fruit should go in with the liquid. If you're using any frozen fruit, save it until a bit later. Add in the chunks of both the creamy and flavorful fruits you're using; you don't need to distinguish between the two.The greens should go on top of the fruit, as it will help keep it from bogging down the blender.Some people prefer to mix just the greens and liquid first until smooth, then add in the fruit. You can experiment to see what works best with your blender.Add any other ingredients on top of the greens.

, Start by just pulsing the mixture to help get it going. This can help break up the fruit and such, so that it won't get as bogged down. After you've pulsed it several times, you can move on to blending it., Now blend the mixture. Start on low at first. Like pulsing first, a low speed helps mix the ingredients together without getting them stuck to the sides. Once you've blended on low for about half a minute, you can move on to blending on high. Keep blending until everything is smooth.If you're having trouble getting your smoothie blended, add in some more liquid, which will help it blend more smoothly.

, If you like your smoothie extra cold, you can add a bit of ice at the end. This point is also when you should add frozen fruit. Blend it all together on high until it's a mostly homogeneous mixture., Your smoothie may come out too thick or too thin if you didn't get the adjustments exactly right. If you find it's not pourable, add in more liquid. You can make it thicker with more frozen fruit or even greens. Blend again until you've got the right texture.You can also add a bit of sweetener now if it's not sweet enough.

, Pick a green of your choice, then add in some tropical flavors. You could use banana, clementine, and coconut water for instance, or mango, pineapple, and coconut milk. The tropical combination is a refreshing start to any day., Collard greens are often overlooked, but they are just as nutrient-packed as kale or spinach. Plus, they're sometimes cheaper since they aren't as popular. Mix collard greens with mango, green grapes, and a couple of tablespoons (30 to 60 milliliters) of lime. Add water or coconut milk to make it thin enough to drink., Another winning combination is ripe pear and a small chunk of fresh ginger. Ginger will make it fresh-tasting and a bit spicy. Add in kale for the greens and a bit of banana to make it sweeter. For the liquid, try citrus kombucha or even a ginger tea., Grapefruit has bright flavor that will wake you up in the morning, plus it's a heavy hitter when it comes to nutrition. Mix it with spinach, a sweet variety of apple, and a bit of banana if you want it sweeter. Use water or a milk alternative to thin it out., Another option is to make berries the star. Use blueberries, cherries, strawberries, and/or blackberries, along with another fruit like apple or banana to sweeten it up. Try it with spinach and coconut water or water. You can also add a small handful of nuts or seeds for protein."

Sweeten the coffee to taste.",How to Make a Coffee Misto," Half of your coffee misto will be made from brewed coffee. You can brew this at regular strength, but this tends to let the coffee flavor disappear beneath the large amount of milk in the drink.


To brew a more authentic and flavorful cup, double the strength of your usual brewed coffee. This can be done easily be simply adding double the amount of ground coffee using the same amount of water.
The coffee misto prepared by Starbucks utilizes coffee brewed at normal strength. To imitate the drink as precisely as possible, brew at regular strength.;
, The other half of your coffee misto is made from heated milk. You can use any type of milk or nondairy product based on your own preferences. The best vessel for heating the milk is a small saucepan.


Traditionally, European café au lait is served without frothing the milk, but simply heating it. A version of the drink popularized in New Orleans actually utilizes scalded milk - that is, milk heated past its boiling point and allowed to form a skin.
Starbucks, however, uses frothed, steamed milk in the coffee misto. To replicate this frothy texture, you can whisk the milk vigorously in the saucepan while it is heating.
The milk can be heated to any temperature you like. 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius) is the most popular temperature for steaming milk.

, When both parts of the drink are prepared, you simply pour them into your drinking cup in equal parts. You can vary the ratios to your taste, of course.


Traditionally, the coffee and milk are poured into the cup side by side (holding the coffee pot in 1 hand and the saucepan in the other). This is done to ensure adequate mixing, a proper ratio, and for dramatic flair.

, You can add any sweeteners you like to your freshly poured coffee misto. In fact, the café au lait is one of the few coffee drinks that is traditionally sweetened by European drinkers.

Grind your coffee beans.,

Start the extraction process.",How to Make an Espresso Like Starbucks1," Buy a quality whole bean coffee and grind it in a “burr” coffee grinder on an espresso (very fine) setting. Aim for a consistency close to that of table salt.Avoid buying pre-ground coffee or coffee beans that have been ground too far in advance of using them. Grind them right before brewing for the freshest coffee and best taste.
To achieve the same authentic taste as a Starbucks espresso, try buying their signature espresso roast from a Starbucks location or grocery store.
A specific espresso roast is not a requirement to make espresso, but whatever type of roast you do use needs to be very finely ground. An espresso roast is usually an oilier bean, which can make the fine grinding process smoother.;
, Pour your ground coffee into the portafilter (the handled tool with a basket for holding grounds) that came with your machine.


A single shot is typically made with 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) of grounds. This is the quantity in a Short or Tall size Starbucks beverage, unless you ask for more.
A double shot is typically made with 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) of grounds. This is the quantity in a Grande or Venti size Starbucks beverage, unless you ask for more or less.
A triple shot is typically made with 2 ounces (6 tablespoons) of grounds. This is the quantity in a Trenta size Starbucks beverage, unless you ask for less.

, Tap your grounds down gently with a finger, then apply an even downward pressure to the grounds with a tamper that you have for your machine. The tamper should be at least 30 pounds and fit the basket snugly.This step compacts the grounds so that water can’t get through as easily, forcing it to interact with the coffee.
Use a tamper of a higher weight if you prefer.

, Add cold, filtered water to the water reservoir of your machine and lock the portafilter into the grouphead of the machine. Put a cup under the spout where the extracted coffee will pour out.


Depending on your machine, you may be able to make other adjustments, like water temperature. Ideal temperature for extracting espresso is 195-205 degrees Fahrenheit.Use a small cup meant for espresso called a demitasse cup under the machine if you want to enjoy espresso on its own, or a larger cup or mug of your desired size if you plan to make additions for another beverage that uses espresso.

, Set your machine to begin brewing, which will vary based on your machine. No matter the amount of grounds you used, the process should take about 20-30 seconds to complete.


If you use a clear cup or shot glass, you can observe the different parts of a successful espresso: crema (the top layer that is light in color and foamy), body (the middle layer of dark brown), and heart (the bottom layer that is darker brown or black)."

",How to Make Starbucks Coffee," At Starbucks, they use two tablespoons, or 10 grams (0.35 oz), of ground coffee for each six ounces of water.


A member of Starbucks' Coffee Education Team says that ""Too few coffee grounds result in over-extracted or bitter coffee. Too many grounds result in under-extracted coffee that does not achieve the full flavor of the blend."";
, This step implies that you are, in fact, grinding your coffee. If you want to make your brew taste just like Starbucks, don't buy pre-ground coffee. Grind it yourself just before brewing for optimum freshness.Depending on your brew method (see part 2) you will need a different level of coarseness for your brew. Pour-over brewing requires a fine grind (like granulated sugar), traditional drip coffee is best with a medium grind (like sea salt) and coffee presses require a coarse grind.Over-extracted coffee tends to taste considerably worse than coarser, under-extracted coffee, so when in doubt go for an under-extracted (coarse) grind.To make it taste like Starbucks coffee, you might want to use the blends available for purchase at Starbucks franchises.

, This may seem like a silly point. Water is just water, right? Wrong. To make Starbucks-quality coffee, always use fresh water, filtered of impurities. Additionally, be sure to heat the water to ""just off boil,"" i.e. between 195 and 205 degrees Fahrenheit (90 to 96 degrees celsius)., As alluded to in Step 3, it's important to use fresh coffee. This means grinding it yourself immediately prior to brewing, but also keeping your beans in an airtight container.


Be sure not to keep your coffee in refrigerator or freezer, even in airtight containers. Another Starbucks' coffee educator says these two appliances are ""“not the friend, but rather the enemy of good coffee."" This is because while being stored in refrigerators and freezers, moisture develops which damages the flavor. , Now that you're following Starbucks' Four Fundamentals of brewing, it's time to select a brewing method. There are three general methods Starbucks uses (technically four, but two of them are just versions of the same thing). These are: coffee press, traditional drip coffee, and pour over (which can be either hot or iced)., Coffee press is the method of brewing most strongly advocated by coffee connoisseurs, as it is believed to be the most effective at staying true to the flavor profile of the beans.


A coffee press requires a coarse grind, so be sure your grounds resemble the size of sea salt.
Fill the press with your grounds, then pour hot water (just off the boil) over the grounds, making sure to completely saturate them.
Place the plunger back on the press but wait four minutes before pressing it down, giving the coffee time to brew. After you've pressed the plunger down, enjoy your coffee!, Drip brewing is perhaps the most convenient method of brewing. You can make multiple cups of coffee in a single brew, and you can do it fast. With the right grind, quality of beans, and pure, fresh water, you can make a brew that rivals that of a coffee press.


For flat-bottom filters be sure to use a medium-sized grind, like the sea salt grind used for a coffee press. Meanwhile, cone-shaped filters are best with a finer grind, like granulated sugar.
After you've got your grind right, just measure out your coffee (2 tablespoons for every six ounces of water) and press ""Brew"" on the machine!
While the convenience is tempting, if you want Starbucks-quality coffee every time, only make however much coffee you need for one sitting. Don't reheat coffee or you will dull the flavor., Another, perhaps lesser-known but equally satisfying, method Starbucks uses is the pour-over, which can be either hot or iced. With the pour-over, you can only make a single cup of coffee, but it will be wonderful.


Boil your water, remembering the 2:6 ration from above, but adding a little extra. Use this extra hot water to moisten your filter.
Once you've boiled your water a pre-moistened your filter, grind your coffee using a fine grind, like that used in cone-shaped filters. It should resemble granulated sugar.
Once you've got your coffee measured out and sitting in your filter, pour your hot water over the grounds, but pause when you've filled it half-way. This allows the coffee to be fully and even saturated, developing flavor.
After your pause, pour over the rest, going in small circles to distribute the water evenly. It should take about three minutes for your cup to be finished brewing.
To make iced coffee, just pour your brew over fresh ice, let it chill, and serve!, Now that you've brewed your coffee according to Starbucks' Four Fundamentals and used one of their brewing methods, pour your cup! You can pour it into mug or, for a true Starbucks experience, get some of their paper cups and sleeves and misspell your name on the cup.

, Depending on your tastes, add a shot of flavored syrup and/or artificial or natural sweetener to the coffee and stir. If you really want to re-create the Starbucks experience, snag a few packets of your favorite sweetening products the next time you're at a Starbucks and use it in your cup at home!


Or perhaps you're a hardy soul and take your coffee black? If so, you're done!

, You can gauge how much creamer you are adding by looking at how light the coffee gets.


There really is no ""right"" way to do this, since this part of making a Starbucks coffee is always up to you, whether it was brewed by a barista or your own hands.

Use an AeroPress.,

Place a small round filter into the cap and screw it onto the chamber. Pour your 1-4 ounces (2-8 tablespoons) of grounds into the chamber and place it over a cup. Pour hot water into the chamber up to the markings for 1, 2, 3, or 4 shots. Stir and then press down gently with the plunger to extract espresso into the cup.Note that some people don’t consider the brewed coffee from an AeroPress to be a true espresso, as it does not produce a crema layer and is not quite as strong. However, an AeroPress achieves nearly the same effect and flavor, and is much more affordable and portable than an espresso machine., Obtain a stovetop espresso maker, also called a moka pot. Pour cold water into the bottom chamber of the pot up to the fill line and place 1-3 ounces (2-6 tablespoons) of grounds into the filter basket that fits into that chamber. Then screw on the top chamber where the brewed espresso will end up and place the pot over high heat on the stove to brew.Note that this method may not brew with quite the same taste, layers, and quality of espresso from an espresso machine, as the steam pressure and filtration methods are not the same. However, a moka pot is much more affordable and portable than an espresso machine.

, Try making an espresso with a coffee press, also called a French press, which uses a glass carafe and a plunger. Add 1-3 ounces (2-6 tablespoons) of grounds to the carafe and then slowly pour in enough hot water to cover the grounds. Allow the coffee to brew in the water for a few minutes before pressing the plunger down to separate the grounds and brewed espresso.

Note that this method doesn’t produce a true espresso my most people’s standards, as it doesn’t use nearly the same steam pressure. However, you can more closely simulate a strong espresso by leaving the grounds and water to interact for longer. A French press is a much more affordable and portable option than an espresso machine."

You can also achieve a ristretto, which is a short shot using ¾ of a typical 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) shot. Or try a lungo, which is a long shot made with 1.5 ounces (3 tablespoons) instead of 1., Pour your desired amount of hot water into a cup with your brewed espresso to make a classic americano drink., Steam milk in your espresso machine by filling a steaming pitcher with cold milk and placing the steam wand of your espresso machine into the milk to heat and froth it before adding it to your espresso.

You can froth milk without an espresso machine by using a handheld frother, a coffee press, or a simple jar to froth it, then heat it in the microwave before adding it to espresso.

, Make a simple macchiato with just a small layer of frothed milk spooned onto the top of a shot of espresso.

Note that Starbucks creates a “latte macchiato” that combines the two traditional drinks together, using much more milk than the typical dollop used for a standard macchiato., Add an amount of steamed milk equal to your shot(s) of espresso. The milk should have little to no foam.

For a variation, try an espresso con panna by replacing steamed milk with whipped cream. Or make a café breve by substituting regular steamed milk with steamed half-and-half (light cream)., Make a latte, also called a café con leche or café au lait, by adding more milk to your espresso. Pour 6 to 8 ounces (¾ to 1 cup) of steamed milk with milk foam over your espresso shot(s).

Try a variation by making a flat white, which uses the same quantity of milk but none of the frothed milk foam.Make a mocha by adding chocolate syrup into the latte with the steamed milk. This is also when you can add any other flavoring syrups to make a latte with hazelnut, vanilla, caramel, etc.

, Make any of the above drinks into a cold and refreshing beverage by adding espresso, ice, and your desired amount of sweetener and milk to a blender for a blended frozen drink. For an iced drink, simply add ice to your prepared espresso drink.

You can pour the ingredients into a cup first if it helps you to get the proportions right.
Try freezing espresso or regular drip coffee into an ice cube tray the night before. Add these coffee ice cubes to your drink so that it doesn’t get watered down.

Pour the milk mixture over the coffee.,
Top it with whipped cream.",How to Make a Starbucks Vanilla Bean Cappucino2," Since it's going to be blended with so many tasty ingredients, make sure it's very strong. Otherwise, the coffee flavor will be masked. The coffee or espresso should taste too strong to drink on its own., Pour them into a small saucepan and place it over medium low heat. Heat the mixture, stirring constantly, until it begins to steam. Don't let it come to a boil. Remove it from heat when you see steam rising from the surface.


If you want an extra rich drink, replace the milk with half and half.
If you don't have sweetened, condensed milk, replace it with regular milk and add one to two tablespoons of sugar to taste.
If you want to make a mocha cappuccino, add 1/4 cup chocolate syrup.

, Stir in the vanilla after you've removed it from heat., You can enjoy it all yourself or divide it in half to share with a friend.

, Be careful, since the mixture will be very hot.

Stick a tall glass in the freezer (optional).,
Let your ice cream soften.,
Combine your ingredients.,
Blend.,
Serve in a cold glass.",How to Make Chocolate Nesquik Milkshakes1," Whether you're using a tall glass or a classic metal cup, popping it in the freezer for a few minutes will keep your milkshake frosty as you sip it. There's no need to stand around – get started on the milkshake while you wait.;
, Using ice cream straight from the freezer can make your milkshake taste dilute, thin, or icy. You'll have much better results if you leave the ice cream out on the counter for about ten minutes, until it's soft and just beginning to melt around the edges.On a hot day, put the ice cream in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes instead.
Heating the ice cream too fast can ruin the texture. This gentle method is best.
Skip this step if using frozen yogurt.

, Add 2 large scoops of the softened ice cream or frozen yogurt to a blender or milkshake maker. Use a large stainless steel bowl instead if you don't have a blender.Add ¼ cup (60 mL) milk for a thick milkshake, or up to a full cup (240 mL) if you prefer a thinner drink. Add ½ cup Chocolate Nesquik powder.


Whole milk makes a richer shake, while low fat or skim milk is a healthier option.
For an extremely rich milkshake, also blend in 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL) heavy whipping cream.
Crushed ice will dilute your milkshake's flavor. Use extra milk instead to thin the shake, and pop the milkshake in the freezer for a few minutes if it's too runny.
If you like a thicker shake consistency, start out with 1/4 cup of milk and add more until you are satisfied with the texture.

, This is easiest with a blender, milkshake maker, or stick blender, on a low setting. If you don't have one of these, burn off some calories in advance with a sturdy whisk.


Semi-frozen ice cream is easiest to blend with a series of short pulses, or with a sturdy fork instead of a whisk. If it still won't blend, mash it against the sides with a rubber spatula or flat spoon and try again., Taste before you pour it into the glass, so you have the option to blend in more milk (thinner) or more ice cream (thickener). Serve with a spoon or thick straw and enjoy immediately.

, Blend this mixture until the Oreos are chopped to your desired texture.


The longer you blend, the smoother and finer the Oreo milkshake will become. If you want larger chunks of cookies, simply pulse the Oreos and whipped cream a few times.

, While there used to be a single kind of Oreo cookie, there are now a variety of Oreo cookie products. From golden to mint to peanut butter, you can easily find a new flavor to mix up.

, Milkshakes can be made with any type of milk. Use skim for a lower-fat milkshake or whole for a creamier one. You can even use non-dairy nut milks or swap out plain milk for a flavored one. Chocolate milk will add an even stronger flavor to your Oreo milkshake.

If you don’t have a blender, you can also use an immersion blender or food processor to make smoothies.;
, Peel the banana and cut it into one-inch (2.5 cm) chunks. Run the berries under cold water to remove dirt. Use a small knife or your fingernail to remove the stems.Cut the strawberries in half if they are larger than one inch (2.5 cm) in width.


You can substitute any or all of the strawberries with other berries, such as blueberries, raspberries, or blackberries., In order to make a perfectly smooth and creamy smoothie, it’s important to add the liquids first, so pour the milk and orange juice into the blender. This will ensure the blender blades have lubrication around them and don’t immediately jam up on the frozen berries.You can either use dairy or non-dairy milks for this recipe. Popular non-dairy options include soy, rice, and almond milk., Your blender should currently have liquid in the bottom and fruit on top. Finally, add the yogurt and honey.


Adding these ingredients last will ensure they are evenly distributed throughout the smoothie., Turn the blender to a low speed and begin blending the ingredients. As some of the fruit chunks get blended and incorporated, turn up the speed a little.Once all the fruit is blended, turn the blender to high to do a final blend and fully incorporate all the ingredients.
Starting the blender on low will prevent an air bubble from forming around the blades.

, Portion the smoothie out equally into two serving glasses. You can serve it over ice, with straws, or any other way you like.

Add ingredients in the right order.",How to Make a Fruit Smoothie4," Every smoothie has at least two main ingredients, and those are liquid and fruit. The liquid portion of a smoothie helps the blender out and makes the consistency smooth and creamy. For every cup of fruit you use, you should add ¼ to 1/3 cup of liquid to the smoothie.Good liquid options include:Non-dairy milk, such as almond, rice, and soy
Coconut milk or coconut water
Water
Dairy milk
Fruit juice
Green tea

, You can use any fruit or fruit combination in a smoothie, but it’s important to choose juicy fruit and creamy fruit for each smoothie. This will ensure a balanced consistency. Use fresh or frozen fruit for the most nutritional benefits. Frozen fruit will give the smoothie a cold and refreshing iciness.


Thick and creamy base fruits include mango, apple, peach, papaya, coconut, avocado, and banana.Juicy fruit options for smoothies include citrus fruits like oranges and grapefruit, pineapple, watermelon, and berries such as strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries.

, As long as you have a liquid and fruit you can make a smoothie, but there are also optional ingredients you can add to enhance the nutritional value or change the flavor or texture.For added nutritional benefits, add about one tablespoon of nut butter, protein powder, hemp hearts, or a small handful of spinach or kale.
For added sweetness, consider using a pinch of brown sugar, honey, or maple syrup, or a couple dates.
For extra flavor, add a pinch of cinnamon, nutmeg, or cloves.
For extra thickness and the right texture, add a few cubes of ice to the smoothie if you used fresh instead of frozen fruit.

, To ensure the right consistency, to protect the blades from damage, and to prevent air bubbles from forming, you should always add the liquid portion of your smoothie to the blender first.You can then add your fruit, ice, and additional ingredients.


Always start the blender on a low speed to prevent air bubbles from forming. If air bubbles form, the blades won’t be able to blend properly. If this happens, turn off the blender, unplug the unit, and use a long spoon to stir everything. Add more liquid before starting up the blender again.

;
, If the ice is crushed, it'll be much easier on your blender and the process will go a lot faster.









What kind of milk? That's up to you. Watching calories? Go non-fat, soy, or almond. Want something creamier? 2% or coconut milk will do the trick.

, This is where your creativity can take over. Vanilla is standard and will let the banana shine, but the world is your Baskin Robbins right now. If you wanted 31 different flavors in your milkshake, it could happen. What are you hankering for?









Some recommendations? Peanut butter, chocolate, peanut butter chocolate, strawberry, coconut, mango, or coffee. And if you can handle it, banana.

, This is for a bit of a zing and texture, but can be omitted. If you don't have almonds on hand but would like something else in your milkshake, consider adding 1/2 cup of oats, quinoa or peanut butter.









Love almonds? Go on, add more!
Now, add vanilla extract, if desired. It'll bring out the natural vanilla flavors in your shake.

, If ice gets lodged in the bottom of your blender, take your spoon and mix it between blending sessions. Aside from that, the blending process should take a minute or two.








, At last, this is an excuse for a taste test! Try a spoonful and gauge how much sugar it needs, if any. Honey is a good natural alternative, and a sugar substitute (such as Splenda) is good, too. A teaspoon or two ought to be enough.








, In a cold mug, the milkshake will stay cold and thick longer. If you have leftovers, keep them in the fridge or the freezer until you crave more.








, The recipe above serves 2. Next time, try your own variation -- banana goes well with many flavors and is a perfect platform for trying wacky combinations.









If you'd like, garnish it with a cherry, whip cream, chocolate chips, or chopped almonds.

, Crushed ice is easier on your blender. And for the liquid, you can go two routes:









A milk substitute, such as soy, almond, or coconut. Your traditional milkshake combines well with chocolate, peanut butter, and other, sweeter, nuttier flavors.
Juice, like orange, apple, or pineapple make a smoothie that combines better with other fruits and vegetables -- like blueberries, mango, kale, or spinach.

, Bananas are sweet enough that they don't need added sugar and if you've used juice or coconut milk, the concoction may be sweet enough. Why don't you give it a taste and see?

Remember to cut off any stems, and to cut out any seeds or pits.

, At this point, your smoothie is almost ready. You can enhance it further, however, by adding in some optional ingredients, such as cooking spices or sweeteners. Listed below are some ideas to get you started:


Spices and flavors, such as cocoa powder, ground cinnamon, or vanilla extract.

Sweeteners, such as chocolate syrup, honey, maple syrup, or agrave nectar

, From time to time, you may want to open up the blender, and use a spatula to push the smoothie down the walls of the blender. This will help the ingredients mix in more evenly.

, If the smoothie is too thick, add some more of your liquid ingredient; if it is too thin, add some more ice or yogurt. If the smoothie is too sweet, you can add some more yogurt or oatmeal; if it is not sweet enough, simply add more of your sweetener. Be sure to blend your smoothie one more time if you do add anything to it.

, You can serve the smoothie as is, or let them chill for 4 to 8 hours. This will give the oats enough time to soak up the liquids and expand, resulting in a thicker, creamier smoothie.,"

, Using ice cream straight from the freezer can make your milkshake taste dilute, thin, or icy. You'll have much better results if you leave the ice cream out on the counter for about ten minutes, until it's soft and just beginning to melt around the edges.On a hot day, put the ice cream in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes instead.
Heating the ice cream too fast can ruin the texture. This gentle method is best.
Skip this step if using frozen yogurt.

, Add two large scoops of the softened ice cream or frozen yogurt to a blender or milkshake maker. Use a large stainless steel bowl instead if you don't have a blender.Add ¼ cup (60 mL) milk for a thick milkshake, or up to a full cup (240 mL) if you prefer a thinner drink.









Whole milk makes a richer shake, while low fat or skim milk is a healthier option.
For an extremely rich milkshake, also blend in 1–2 tablespoons (15–30 mL) heavy whipping cream.
Crushed ice will dilute your milkshake's flavor. Use extra milk instead to thin the shake, and pop the milkshake in the freezer for a few minutes if it's too runny.

, If you used vanilla ice cream, or you want to enhance the chocolate flavor, add one of these ingredients:









2 tablespoons (30 mL) chocolate syrup, blended for another 10–30 seconds. Use up to 4 tablespoons (60 mL) if using vanilla ice cream.

Melt a few squares of chocolate or a handful of chocolate chips in a double boiler, or zap in the microwave for 10 seconds at a time, stirring in between zaps. If using this as your only chocolate ingredient, use approximately ¼ cup (60 mL) of chocolate.
2 tablespoons (30 mL) cocoa powder will add flavor to an already-chocolatey shake, but may not be strong enough to use as the only chocolate ingredient.

, This is easiest with a blender, milkshake maker, or stick blender, on a low setting. If you don't have one of these, burn off some calories in advance with a sturdy whisk.









Semi-frozen ice cream is easiest to blend with a series of short pulses, or with a sturdy fork instead of a whisk. If it still won't blend, mash it against the sides with a rubber spatula or flat spoon and try again., Taste before you pour it into the glass, so you have the option to blend in more milk (thinner) or more ice cream (thickener).

Serve at once.",How to Make a Banana Milkshake Without a Blender," Mash it with a wooden spoon or a whisk until very smooth in a bowl.


Many children love mashing banana. If you have children, ask them to help with this step!;
, Aim to have no banana lumps as a rotary whisk (see the ""things you need"" section for an image of a rotary whisk) may remove most lumps, but lumps of banana can make it harder to use a straw when drinking.


Aside from vanilla icecream, Chocolate is a great flavour, as well as other fruit ice creams or gelato that would work with banana.

, This will make a fairly thick milkshake, so you can add more milk and desired sweetener to balance it out to a preferred consistency. Older fashioned milkshakes appear to favour a high milk and sugar ratio to icecream and fruit to make an easy to drink consistency and was shaken with the aim to get a big head of foam when poured in the glass (a bit like an iced cappuccino in concept). More modern recipes seem to favour the ""thick-shake"" cream like consistency, so its easy to make this to suit both styles.

, You can also use container with a tight seal (such as a large jar or other storage container).


Cocktail shakers or a large jar make the best milkshakes, after all, while the ""milk-bar"" age was when power blenders were mainstream, they had to use something before electricity was available and most bars would be incomplete without a cocktail shaker. Further to that, shaking or churning milk in a jar is an age old way to make butter.

, Shake again briefly to mix. It's easiest to add extra ice cream, honey or other syrups which mixes in smoothly, as sugar can stay powdery or gritty in a thick, cold liquid which already contains some sugar.

, You may pour the milkshake through a sieve if you want a super smooth milkshake but that does add to the washing up, something less desirable on a hot day!

, Ice cubes should only be in a little amount; about 4 to 6 cubes is enough, depending on the size. Ice cream is more for milkshakes and the flavor of the ice cream is up to you. Strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla are the top flavors in shakes. Milk is added in smoothies and shakes, but use a little portion because you don't want to overpower the other flavors.

, Chop up strawberries, bananas, and other tasty foods. Make sure that the fruit is fully washed before putting it into the blender and the action of chopping or cutting the fruit makes it easier in the blending process.

, For a citrus taste, you can put in some orange juice or even lemonade. If you are going for a chocolate smoothie, squeeze in some chocolate syrup.

, Place them together in a bowl and use a spoon to mix up the buds and butter, making sure each piece is coated with fat. You want the grounds to be completely coated, but not soaked in butter; too much will inhibit the release of THC.


Note: If you want a potent marijuana tea it's necessary to extract the THC from the plant. Since THC is not soluble in water alone it requires a fatty substance to cling onto under high heat. The combination of the high heat from the hot water and the fat from the butter removes the THC from the ground buds and allows you to ingest it.

, Use a scissors to cut off the top of the bag, then empty the contents. Spoon the ground marijuana into the bag, then fold it over several times to keep the marijuana from spilling out.If you have a metal tea ball, you can use that instead.
Or use a coffee filter: place the marijuana in the center of the filter, then gather the edges and tie it up to make a little bag.

If you have a metal tea ball, you can use that instead.
Or use a coffee filter: place the marijuana in the center of the filter, then gather the edges and tie it up to make a little bag.

, Stir in sugar, honey or milk to taste.


Note: Plain marijuana tea has a nice herbal flavor but will not produce a high, since it's necessary to extract the THC using fat to get the full effect. If you want potent marijuana tea, use a different method.

",How to Make Herbal Tea," There are many herbal tea selections to try.



Relaxing - if you are trying to get some rest, look for a tea with chamomile as the main ingredient.

Uplifting - lavender, thyme, and spearmint are also good things to look for in a blend.

Soothing - if you are trying to soothe a cold you'll want something with eucalyptus, ginger, cinnamon, and/or licorice root.;
, The least you should ever heat up in a kettle is two cups. Any less then that, and you run the risk of boiling your kettle boil dry. Put the kettle on the stove (or plug in the electric kettle) and bring the water to boiling.

, Put lids on each to keep in the heat. By heating up the cups and pot, your tea will keep warmer longer, and you lessen the risk of having a teacup or top shatter.

, When the water has come to a rolling boil, empty the teapot of warm water and add the herbal tea leaves/flowers or tea bags. The general rule when making a pot of tea is to add a teaspoon of leaves (or a tea bag) for each cup and one for the pot. If only making tea for one in a cup or mug, then add the bag or leaves to the mug and pour the boiling water over them.

, While steeping too long can bring out the bitter tannins in black, green, or white teas, herbal teas are different. They generally don't have many tannins and therefore can be steeped anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes. Use extra tea leaves to make a stronger tea;not a longer steeping time.

,, Sugar or honey may be used to taste. However, some herbal teas are naturally sweet. One should taste each tea by itself first before deciding if milk and honey are needed.

Set a pot of water on the stove to boil.,
Put the dried hibiscus flowers into an empty teapot.,
Pour the boiling water into the teapot.,
For caffeinated tea, add a tea bag to the water.,
Leave the tea to steep for five minutes.,
Strain the tea as you pour it.,
Sweeten the tea as desired.,
Add cinnamon, mint, or lime wedge as garnish.",How to Make Hibiscus Tea1," While you're waiting for it to heat up, you can ready your other ingredients and clean out the teapot you'll be using.

See our guide to boiling water for stove and microwave suggestions.;
, The recipe calls for about 2 teaspoons (10 ml), but you can use more or less as needed for a stronger or weaker flavor.


Hibiscus does not contain caffeine, so adding a lot won't give you a sudden ""jolt"" of energy., Fill the teapot to the brim (or simply add as much as you plan to drink).


Use oven mitts and/or a tea cozy to protect yourself from burns here. Pour the water slowly and steadily to avoid splashing.

, As noted above, hibiscus tea doesn't have any caffeine on its own. If you'd like to get some energy from the tea (or if you just like the taste), you can carefully add a bag of your preferred caffeinated tea to the hot water at this point. Hibiscus tea tastes great on its own, however.

For extra caffeine, add multiple bags.

, This is the easy part — all you need to do is wait. About five minutes should be long enough for the flowers to give the water a somewhat tart taste and a pleasant red color. Let the tea steep longer for a stronger flavor. Let it steep for less time if you want a weaker flavor.

, Now, you just need to get the flowers out. If your teapot does not have a built-in filter or mesh, pour the tea into your cup through a fine metal strainer. In a pinch, you can also use a paper coffee filter.


You can also simply leave the hibiscus leaves in the tea if you like. They won't hurt you — there is no current evidence that they are poisonous in any way., Your tea is now ready to enjoy. If you like, you can add as much of your preferred sweetener as you want (or none at all). The smooth, sweet taste of honey goes especially well with the tartness of hibiscus. Sugar and zero-calorie sweeteners are also good choices.

, If you want to give your tea a little ""something extra,"" try one of these garnishes (or all three). The flavor and aroma of these substances complement hibiscus tea for three different delicious combinations.

If you're using mint, lay the leaves face-up in the palm of your hand and give them a slap by clapping your hands together. This is a technique used by bartenders in drinks like mojitos to release the flavor and aroma of the mint."

Add hibiscus and water to pitcher.,
Refrigerate overnight.,
Strain and serve over ice.,
To sweeten, add simple syrup.",How to Make Hibiscus Tea2," Once you have the right ingredients, making hibiscus iced tea is easy — it just takes a long time. Start by putting the hibiscus in a pitcher and pouring in water. Stir briefly to combine.

If you're using caffeinated tea bags, cinnamon sticks, lime wedges, or mint leaves in your tea, add them now as well.

, Cold water takes a long time to absorb flavor from other ingredients, so you'll need to let your tea steep for at least 8 to 12 hours. Keep it cool in the fridge while it slowly picks up the flavor and color of the hibiscus.

Cover the tea with foil or plastic wrap to protect it from drips and crumbs.

, When the tea has gained a satisfying flavor and color, remove it from the fridge. Fill cups with ice and pour the tea through a strainer or paper filter to remove the flowers and whatever other ingredients you added. Your iced tea is now ready to enjoy!

For presentation, you can re-garnish each glass with cinnamon, lime, etc. if you wish.

, You can sweeten iced tea with sugar, honey, etc., but this doesn't work very well because cold water doesn't dissolve solids very quickly. A better idea is to use simple syrup, which can sweeten the tea right away because it is liquid. See our guide to making this sweetener for detailed instructions.

To make simple syrup, just heat equal parts water and sugar in a pan on the stove. Stir well to combine. When the sugar has completely dissolved, you have simple syrup. Continuing to heat the syrup past this point will make it thicker. Eventually, it will turn into caramel, which you probably don't want.
1 cup of simple syrup (made from 1 cup of water and 1 cup of sugar) will make the tea quite sweet. 1/4 or 1/3 cup will give a much more mild sweetness."

Find ripe hibiscus flowers.,
Pick the calyx.,
Remove the seed pods.,
Use the calyxes in your tea.,
Alternatively, dry and store in an airtight container.",How to Make Hibiscus Tea3," A few days after hibiscus flowers bloom, their petals start to wrinkle and wilt. Eventually, they will fall off. Wrinkles on the petals are a sign that the plant is ripe and ready to harvest.

Hibiscus plants are capable of blooming year-round. They are most likely to do this during the spring and summer when the weather is best, but they can even bloom in the winter in suitable climates., At the base of the hibiscus flower should be a round, bulb-like part that connects it to the stem. This is the calyx. If the plant is ripe, the calyx will be firm and red. Pull the entire flower (calyx and petals) from the stem — it should snap off. Remove the petals to expose the calyx., Inside each calyx is a single spherical seed pod. You want to remove this before you make the tea while keeping the calyx as intact as possible. The easiest way to do this will usually be to simply cut a vertical slit in the side of the calyx and pop the seed pod out with your fingers. Don't worry too much about mangling the calyx as you get the pod out. It won't affect the taste — it's mostly for presentation's sake., Wash the calyxes once all the seed pods are removed. They're now ready for use in your tea. Use the calyxes just like you would use dried hibiscus in either of the recipes above., If you don't want to use the hibiscus to make tea right away, pat the calyxes dry with a paper towel, then let them dry completely before storing them. There are several ways you can do this:

Seal the flowers in an airtight container with silica.This is the same chemical used in the drying packets sometimes found in clothes pockets. You can buy silica desiccant (the kind used for drying) from chemical supply retailers.
Put the hibiscus on a rack or tray in the oven at a low temperature (like 100 degrees F) for several hours. See our article on drying flowers for details.
If the weather's hot and dry, you can also leave them on a drying rack in the sun. Try to put them somewhere animals won't get to them.

, A non-metal container is preferred, as a metal container can compromise the purity of the horehound tea as will plastic. Swish the hot water in the container, then pour the water down the sink.

, Horehound has essential oils that will evaporate with the steam, so steeping should be done while covered tightly. You can use a saucer, some tea cups come with a decorative cover for this purpose. Use 2 tablespoons of fresh horehound leaves for each cup of boiling water. Traditionally, one extra tablespoon of fresh leaves are added ""for the pot."" If you are making tea with dried horehound, use one tablespoon for each cup of boiling water, plus one tablespoon ""for the pot.""

, Check the tea often, as the steeping time will depend on if you prefer your horehound tea weak or strong.

, Garnish the horehound tea with honey, a sprig of peppermint, a small amount of fresh ginger or a lemon slice. A teaspoon of anise seed will provide a licorice flavor to your horehound tea.

Make it a special event.",How to Serve Tea1," Decide if you'd like to serve loose leaf or bagged tea and choose what types of tea to serve. For a small gathering, you may only want to serve one type, but for a larger party you could offer your guests a variety. Some popular types of tea include:

Black teas: darjeeling, ceylon, assam
Green and herbal teas: jasmine, chamomile, mint
Flavored teas: Earl Grey, lemon ginger, chocolate rooibos;
, Follow the manufacturer's brewing instructions for green or herbal teas. For most black teas, you'll need to bring fresh water to a boil in a kettle. Rinse the teapot out with hot water and place the tea leaves or bags into it. Fill the teapot with hot water and let the tea steep for 3 to 5 minutes, depending on how strong you like it. Stir the tea and serve it.If you used loose leaf tea, you'll need to strain it when pouring it into your guest's cup.
Avoid squeezing the tea bags with your spoon. This will make the tea bitter.

, Afternoon or low tea is usually served between 3 and 5 pm. You should serve the tea along with a variety of sweet and savory foods. These should be bite-sized so your guests can just nibble as they sip their tea. Offer your guests tiny sandwiches, scones, and pastries.For finger sandwiches, consider serving cucumber and cream cheese, sliced tomato and watercress, or chicken salad sandwiches with the crusts trimmed.
Consider serving a variety of miniature sweet scones that you can serve with clotted cream, jam, or citrus curds.
You can buy or make small pastries and baked goods like shortbread, macarons, or tea cake.

, High tea is often confused with afternoon tea, but it refers to a basic meal served with tea around dinner time. Because this is an informal tea, you can set out cold meats, cooked eggs, fish, cakes, and sandwiches along with the brewed tea.You can still set out cookies and fruit, but they don't need to be as elaborate as those for afternoon tea.

, Ask your guests how they take their tea. Pour the tea into their cup and then add the lemon, milk, or sugar they asked for. Give the cup to your guest and let them serve themselves food. You can drink your tea once you've served all of your guests.Consider offering alternative milks or sugars for your guests. For example, offer soy milk or almond milk instead of cow's milk. You can also offer honey or stevia instead of granulated sugar.

, In addition to traditional afternoon teas, you can make the event more of a party. For example, serve champagne or sherry to make it a royale tea. For a celebration tea, you can also serve a decadent cake. Or if you just want to make a mid-morning tea more special, make it a cream tea by serving scones with clotted cream and fruit curds.If the weather is nice, consider serving the tea outside.
For a party, send your guests home with tea party favors. For example, you could send them home with tea strainers, cookies shaped like teapots, or sachets of tea.

You can also boil water in a pot on the stove if you don’t have a kettle.;
, Despite the name, low tea is actually a very refined event that began with British royalty back in the 1800s. As such, you should always use your finest china and best teapots when you serve low tea.Any teapot will actually suffice when you want to serve tea, but you can always visit thrift and second hand stores to find fine china at an affordable price.

, When the kettle boils, pour a cup (235 ml) of boiling water into the teapot. Swirl the water around to warm the pot, and then pour out the water. This will prime the teapot and make sure that no heat is lost when you brew the tea., For each person, measure 1 cup (235 ml) of water and either 1 teaspoon (1 g) of loose leaf tea or one tea bag per two people. Add the tea to the warmed teapot, followed by the water. Allow the tea to steep for three to five minutes before removing the bags or straining the leaves.You can brew any type of tea you like when you serve high tea, including:Earl Grey
English breakfast
Peppermint
Herbal tea
Chamomile

, Not everybody likes their tea the same strength. Boil another kettleful of water and transfer the hot water to another teapot or a heat-safe pitcher. That way, guests can dilute their own tea if they find it too strong., The types of snacks you serve at low tea will vary depending on your tastes and likes, but scones are a traditional choice for afternoon tea. You can serve both sweet and savory scones, including:Plain
Buttermilk
Chocolate
Fruit and nut
Whole wheat

Ham and cheese

, Scones at low tea are most often served with jams, preserves, and cream. For example, Devonshire cream tea has a specific menu that pairs tea with scones, strawberry jam, and clotted cream.Other types of jams and preserves you can serve include rhubarb, ginger, raspberry, and mixed berry., Another important part of the low tea menu is savory treats, which are often small bite-sized and handheld delicacies. Some of the most popular savory snacks for low tea include tea sandwiches, cheese puffs, and savory tarts or pies., The number of sweet goodies you can serve at low tea are endless. Many of these items can be purchased at the grocery store, but you can also make your own if you have the time. Some popular options for sweet snacks at afternoon tea include:Fruit breads like banana bread

Cakes like sponge

Macaroons and French macarons

Cookies and biscuits, such as finger cookies, ginger nuts, and shortbread
Squares and tarts

, The treats at low tea are traditionally served on a three-tiered platter. The scones, which will be eaten first, should be arranged on the top platter, followed by the savory snacks in the middle. The sweet treats should be placed on the bottom tier, as they will be eaten last., Low tea is a mid-afternoon snack that takes care of hunger that occurs between lunch and dinner. Because of this, afternoon tea should be held between 3 and 5 in the afternoon, and the traditional time is at 4 p.m., Tea at low tea should be served with milk, sugar, and lemon, because everybody likes their tea prepared a different way. To make sure all your guests are accommodated, fill a creamer with milk and a sugar bowl with sugar. Finally, cut a lemon into small wedges and place the wedges on a plate.There are ways to drink tea with these simple ingredients, including:

, While low tea is taken in comfortable lounge chairs, you should lay out the tea and snacks on a kitchen or serving table. Cover the table with a clean table cloth. To set the table properly for low tea:Place the tea tray at one end of the table, and set the tea pot, creamer, sugar, and lemon on the tray
Set out the cups, saucers, and spoons to the right of the tea tray
On the left of the tray, place your plates, silverware, and napkins
Place the clotted cream, preserves, and tiered server with snacks in the center of the table
Lay individual serving spoons in front of the preserves and clotted cream

, It is customary for the host to pour tea for guests. When you're ready to serve tea and eat, stand at the end of the table with the tea and china and pour a cup of tea for each guest. Ask each guest how they take their tea. Always pour tea first, followed by sugar and lemon, and milk last.Carefully hand the cup, saucer, and a napkin to each guest.

While the host should serve the first cup of tea, it is acceptable to have close friends or family help with the serving.

, Once the tea has been served, guests can serve themselves snacks. It is proper to eat the scones first, followed by the savory snacks, and finishing with the sweets and cakes. This way, the freshly baked scones are enjoyed warm., Once everybody has tea and snacks, you can sit down together to enjoy your low tea. Place your napkin in your lap when you sit down. The snacks should be eaten delicately and neatly with your hands, but don’t lick your fingers. When you stir your tea, be careful not to clank too much."

Air drying is simple: Arrange the peel on a tray lined with parchment paper. Leave in a warm spot. The peel should be dry within 12 to 24 hours.
Peel can be dried in a dehydrator.
Peel can be heated in a low temperature oven for 30 minutes to an hour or so.

, Leave for a few days to infuse. Tea readily absorbs flavors it is in touch with (hence the reason for storing it in separate, airtight containers)., The flavor of the peel should come through into the tea., It is recommended that you keep trying different amounts of peel to see how much produces the flavor that you find the most pleasing."

Rinse the tea leaves.,
Fill the teapot with water and steep the tea.,
Pour the tea into the warmed teacups and serve the tea.,
Fill the teapot with more water for another serving of tea.",How to Serve Tea2," Decide if you will offer one type of tea or a variety of teas. For example, you may serve your guests loose leaf red tea (also called black tea), green tea, white tea, Oolong tea, and Pu-erh tea. Pu-erh and red tea are the strongest teas (both fermented), while green tea is the least processed. White tea (which is only mildly fermented) and Oolong have mild, light flavors.Popular types of Chinese tea include Lapsang Souchong which has a smokey flavor and Dragon Pearl Jasmine, a light green tea.

, Once you've chosen your tea, show the leaves to your guests. Give each guest a chance to smell the tea leaves. The focus on serving the tea should be on the tea itself, rather than the process of serving it., Place the teapot and teacups on a slatted bamboo box. Bring water to boil and carefully pour it into your Chinese teapot and small teacups. Let them sit while you prepare the tea so the teapot is sterilized and stays warm. Pour out the water just before you're ready to fill the pot with tea. It's important to use a different pot for each type of tea, since the clay of the teapot absorbs some of the tea's essence.Chinese teapots (called Yixing teapots) are smaller than Western teapots and made of unglazed clay. While most of these only hold around 1 cup (240 ml) of tea, you can use a larger pot if you're serving several people.

, Fill a kettle with fresh water and put it on the stove. Heat the water for your specific type of tea. For example, only heat water for green or jasmine tea to 185 degrees (85 degrees C) which is not quite to boiling. Heat the water for Pu-erh and black teas to a rolling boil (212 degrees F or 100 degrees C). Carefully pour a little of the water over the tea strainer to sterilize it., Use a bamboo or wood scoop to fill the empty teapot with 1/4 to 1/3 cup (16 to 22 g) of your loose leaf tea and fill the pot with hot water. Let the water overflow the brim of the teapot. Carefully tilt the teapot to an angle so the heat can get out of the teapot and keep the leaves from overcooking. Pour all of the water out of the teapot.You can pour the water over the teacups to keep them warm. Keep in mind that you won't be drinking this since you're just rinsing the leaves and getting them to open up.

, Fill the teapot with hot water and put the lid on the pot. Continue to pour hot water over the teapot for several seconds so the tea brews evenly inside the pot. Remember your teapot should be on the slatted bamboo box. Steep the tea for 4 to 7 seconds. Dump the hot water out of the teacups.The short brew time is possible because the tea leaves have been rinsed and opened.

, Set the strainer over a teacup and pour the steeped tea into the teacup. Fill each cup about three-quarters of the way full. Invite your guests to drink the tea by holding the teacup with both hands and placing it to the right of your guest.Chinese tea should be served plain, without milk, sugar or lemon.

, You can use the same tea leaves to brew another 3 or 4 batches of tea, depending on the quality of the tea leaves you're using. Keep in mind that you'll need a little more steeping time with each subsequent brew.For example, for the second brew, you'll need 6 to 8 seconds seconds. For the third brew, you'll need 8 to 10 seconds and for the fourth brew, you'll need 10 to 12 seconds.

Add a handful of fresh mint and sugar according to your taste. Steep the tea for about 5 minutes. To serve the tea, carefully pour it from up high into small glass cups. This will create a little foam.You can add more water to the kettle for a second brewing. Keep in mind that the flavor will change as the leaves continue to steep.

, Fill the mate (a small dried gourd) 2/3 full of yerba mate. Tilt the gourd so the yerba mate collects on one side. Cover the top of a bombilla (filter straw) with your thumb and insert the filtered end into the side of the gourd that doesn't have the yerba mate. Release your thumb and pour a few teaspoons of cold water near the straw. Slowly fill the gourd with hot water that's about 150 degrees F (65 degrees C). Sip the tea through the bombilla.Serving yerba mate is a social event. You can fill the gourd and pass it around to your guests. You can refill the gourd with fresh hot water 15 to 20 times.

Know your budget.,
Decide if you wish to select tea party food based on where you will hold your tea party.,
Consider the size of your tea party.,
Cater for the ages and preferences of your tea party attendees.,
Select foods that pair well with tea and that can be easily served and eaten at your party.,
Ensure the food you select is sufficient for your guests.,
Fancy things up.,
Consider an edible centrepiece.,
Assess what equipment you will need to make the most of your tea party and select the food.",How to Select Food for a Tea Party," Put the focus on buying quality, not quantity. The tea should be good quality, it's a tea party after all.


Think about what you can save money on; for example, paper napkins don't have to come from a high end retailer. Milk can be from anywhere, as long as it's fresh. Shop for any vegetables, i.e. cucumber, at the market or greengrocers instead of the supermarket. A bakery, especially at the end of the day, might be a more cost effective option for some items than the supermarket.
Don't over cater. Unless you want to be eating tea party food for days after your event, or worse, throwing away spoiled food, buy enough food, not too much.;
, If you choose whether a quiet and private spot, you can select more elaborate food, for instance. If you out in a park having a picnic tea party, you may want to select simpler, more easily portable foods that won't melt in the heat or require refrigeration.

, To select food, you'll need to know how many people you are catering for. The location of your tea party may also depend on the amount of people attending.

, Children may enjoy foods different from those the adults would like. For example, a birthday tea party may require a cake. Or, a bridal shower tea party may be themed to include such things as a diaper-shaped cake, small baby cakes and a statue of baby cheeses. Select food suitable for all your guests, consider their dietary needs, their cultural requirements and of course, what they will enjoy!

, You can give all of your guests a place setting with flatware, etc. Or, serve finger food. Finger food is more traditional at a tea party but you can serve dishes that need a knife and fork to eat them if you wish. Some classic tea party foods include:


Cucumber sandwiches
Smoked salmon sandwiches
Scones with clotted cream and jam
Iced buns
Macaroons.

, You will need at least one of everything for each person. A tea party meal should contain as much food per person as would be eaten at a normal lunch. You don't need to serve the equivalent of a three course meal, unless you want to.

, You can make ordinary foods look fancy for a tea party. How biscuits, cookies, candies etc are arranged on a plate can make them look more, or less attractive. Select dainty foods that look pretty served on paper doilies, if that's your thing.

, Are you going to serve a large birthday cake, Christmas Cake or other celebration cake? You may wish to select fewer small cakes and other sweet treats if everyone will be enjoying a slice of cake, or two.

, Have you got a cake stand? Do you have enough matching side plates? Can you keep everything cold or hot? Will you need a piping bag? A smoker? Select food that you can already prepare and serve or buy the additional equipment you will need.


Set up with plenty of time to spare so that you have time to yourself.
If you're self-catering, it's useful to set up the seating/eating areas earlier, then focus mainly on food preparation prior to the guests' arrival, allowing time for dressing yourself too.

Plan an activity.",How to Host an English Style High Tea," Consider your guests when choosing a time. People often host tea during the afternoon. Work and/or school may be a problem during the afternoon on weekdays, however. A weekend afternoon tea could be ideal if you let your guests know about the date you choose in enough time. You should choose a date at least a month before the tea. A couple of weeks ahead of time could be okay for a less formal gathering.If possible, ask your guests what times would be best for them.;
, Choose and send out invitations about one month before the intended gathering. You can purchase invitations and send them out through the mail. It is also possible to find invitations online, print them out, and send them. If you don’t want to send out invitations through the physical mail, you can also send out emails or call your guests.You can find invitations made specifically for teas on invitation websites.

, If you’re hosting a high tea, it is necessary to serve a variety of teas. Hot tea is the most traditional beverage to serve. You should purchase a variety of teas. Black, green, chamomile, fruit tea, and oolong tea are some of the types of teas you can serve. You should also provide some beverages outside of hot tea for guests that don’t like hot tea.You can also serve cold tea, juices, and cocktails if mostly adults will be attending.
You will also need sugar and milk for the tea.

, Food at a tea is usually light and easy to pick up and eat. Small sandwiches are usually served. Some type of sandwiches common at teas are carrot and raisin, crab, and salmon and avocado. Along with sandwiches, scones, teacakes, and buns are also served. Some common desserts that are put out at teas are biscuits (cookies), cakes, and pastries.Some options for scones are lemon drizzle, walnut, and cherry. They should be served with jam.
Shortbread, carrot cake, gingerbread, and coconut cookies are some options.

, Even if you’re not decorating extravagantly, you will need some supplies for the tea. A tea set consisting of a teapot and tea cups. You will also need plates and cutlery. Along with the basics, you will need a tablecloth, napkins, and serving trays for the food., If you will be decorating, put up the decorations the night before or the morning of the tea. Some options for decorations are lanterns, flowers, ribbons, candles, and streamers.If you want to diverge from the classic English tea, you can choose to decorate based on a theme, like Alice in Wonderland.

, Set up the area you will be having the tea on the morning of the tea. Put the tablecloth on the table or tables. Set out the napkins, cutlery, and dishes, and cups. How much you set up depends on how you plan to serve the tea and food. If you plan for your guests to serve themselves, you can set out the tea cups and plates at this time. If you plan to serve your guests, you will bring them out once your guests are seated., Once all of the preparations have been made, get dressed for the event. How you dress depends on how formal the tea is. Typically, an English style high tea calls for not quite formal, but nice attire. A dress or casual suit will work. If you’re following the English style, you may want to wear an elaborate hat that the British are so well known for.If you’re having a themed party, dress in costume according to that theme.

, If you’re not serving the guests, set out the tea five to ten minutes before the tea is set to start. Put out the teapot with boiling water. You can either set out tea bags around the teapot, or put out several pots with the teabags already in the pot. Put out milk and sugar next to the tea., There are a few different options for how to serve tea. An easy and common way is to set the food out on trays so that the guests can serve themselves as they please. You can also choose to set out some food and serve some food. Or, you can serve all of the food., Play some light music as your guests begin to arrive, and let it play softly in the background as the tea goes on. Classical music is a great choice for a tea. If that doesn’t work for you, soft jazz work well too.You can also find an “Afternoon tea” playlist on websites like YouTube and on music streaming services like Pandora and Spotify.

, As your guests arrive, welcome each guest in the way that is most comfortable to you. Show your guests to the area where the tea is being held. If you have places set for each person, show the guest to their place. Offer a drink to each guest as they arrive., Once most or all of your guests have arrived, begin the tea. Serve or offer food in the way you’ve chosen. Anticipate the needs of your guests during the event. Bring out more boiling water when the teapot begins to empty. Have extra food available in the kitchen if food begins to run low., Having food, tea, and conversation is enough for the event. If that falls short, there are some activities you can plan. For example, you can have guests make their own teas by setting out tea bags, tea, strings, and staples to close the bags. You can also purchase plain, white teacups, paint, and paintbrushes and have guests decorate their own teacups to take home.If you will be having children at the party, you can plan some activities specifically for them, like a treasure hunt or tea bag toss."

Place the container in direct sunlight for 2 - 4 hours.,
Remove the teabags.,
Serve the sun tea.",How to Make Sun Tea1," The container you use to make sun tea should be clear, to allow the sun's rays to penetrate to the tea bags and water. Choose a container that has a lid so you can prevent bugs and other outside particles from getting into your tea as it steeps.









Make sure to use a container that is easy to clean. Don't use one that could easily harbor bacteria, like a container with a spigot that's difficult to wash.
Avoid using plastic containers to make sun tea. Chemicals in the plastic can leach into the water, affecting the tea's taste and posing a health risk as well.;
, Water heated by the sun reaches a maximum temperature of 130 degrees - the perfect temperature for bacteria to breed.To reduce the chance that your tea gets contaminated with bacteria, it's important to sanitize the container you're using.









Bring a large pot of water to a boil on the stove. Place the container in the water and let it boil for a few minutes, then remove it with tongs and allow it to drain dry.
If you'd prefer not to using the boiling method (after all, it's summer!) use soap and hot water to thoroughly cleanse the container and lid.

, As an additional precaution against bacterial growth, choose distilled water, which you can buy by the gallon at the grocery store. You could also use bottled spring water for the cleanest flavor.








, Any kind of teabags make great sun tea. Choose black tea, green tea, or any variety of herbal tea. If you want the tea to be extra strong, add more than 5 teabags. You can always dilute it with more water to reduce its strength if necessary.








, You can put it in the windowsill or place it outside on a table. Just make sure it's in a place where the sun hits it directly and it's not obscured by shadows.









Do not let the tea sit in the sun for over 4 hours. Leaving it out for a longer period of time encourages bacteria to grow.
Avoid placing the container directly on the ground. Put it on a tray or another clean surface.

, After a few hours in the sun, your tea should look colorful and strong. Remove the tea bags and discard them. You can keep the tea in the same container if you wish to refrigerate it.









Examine the surface of the tea for bacterial growth. If you see ropey strands or white spots, discard the tea.
The tea shouldn't have a thick or syrupy consistency; if it does, discard it.

, You can mix some sugar into the tea if you'd like. Fill some glasses with ice and pour the tea into the glasses.

Experiment with different flavor combinations. Try lemon balm with chamomile, mint with rosemary, or basil with hibiscus, for example.
Choose herbs that are at their fresh, healthy peak. Pick them fresh, if possible. If you buy them at the store, make sure they don't look wilted or discolored.
Try to get organic herbs. Brewing tea with herbs that were treated with pesticides is not a healthy practice.

Ask the cup holder to prepare the tea leaves.,
Turn the cup over so that the handle faces the person seeking the answers.

,
Understand the time line and placement of the tea leaves within the cup.Zones from top to bottom may represent either ""distance"" or ""weight"" of the omens.,
Read the tea leaves.",How to Do Tasseography," The following aspects of the cup are important:The teacup should be wide, shallow and have sloping sides.
It should be white or pale on the interior. Cups with patterning on the inside are not suitable for reading tea leaves.
Use cups, not mugs or narrow cups -- the latter make it hard to see.;
, Fine leaf tea leaves are the best; larger leaves are all right but might be harder to read. If you prefer a certain scent over another, that might also have a bearing on your enjoyment of reading tea leaves. In addition, some scents might connote different spiritual meanings for you., It is important that the reading take place in a comfortable and quiet space. The way in which you make it comfortable is entirely up to you but it is important to remove distractions and to improve the ambiance:


Turn off electronic media such as the TV, cell phones, take the phone off the hook, computers, etc.
Use a small table or coffee table to sit around. Add a pretty tablecloth to enhance the appearance.
Helen Farley recommends saying a prayer for protection, especially when reading for strangers, to ward off any bad energy., Obviously, the tea must be made using loose tea leaves. Do not strain the tea when pouring from a teapot; if making straight in the cup, simply add the leaves direct to the cup and pour the hot water over the top.

, The person who is asking the question needs to drink the tea and it is that teacup which will be read from. Ask the person to drink until there is about a teaspoon of liquid left in the cup.


For people who don't like tea, simply drop a teaspoon or so of tea leaves into a cup they have chosen with a teaspoon of liquid.

, There is a deliberate ritual involved here, in order to make the most of the reading:Ask the person to think of the most prominent questions.
Have the person swish the cup to the left three times, holding it in their left hand.Ask them to turn the cup upside down on the saucer, gently. This will allow the liquid to drain out.
Still with the left hand, have the person turn the cup three times to the left while upside down on the saucer.
Have them hold their hands on the cup in that position, think about the important questions again for a count of seven.

,, Images near the top (rim) are close while images near the bottom are distant. In terms of time, the distance from rim to base represents approximately 6 months. However, ""distance"" may also refer to relationship to a person or goal. The other way of looking at it is that images at the base of the cup can represent a ""heavy"" (ill) omen and, as they come nearer the rim, are ""light"" or joyful omens. The context will determine which is applicable. Context and symbolism are most important. Trust your instincts.
The handle of the cup is known as the ""domain"" and images near the handle are images related to home life and family. The further from the handle an image is the more ""outside"" the omen. Symbols opposite the handle relate to work or strangers, somewhere in between might relate to non-immediate family or ""a friend of a friend."" Images to the RIGHT of the handle indicate something coming TO the querent while images to the LEFT of the handle represent things coming FROM the domain.
A big clump of tea leaves with no discernible image might augur trouble on its way. If it is opposite to the handle, the trouble will likely be not of your making but if it is under the handle, it is considered to be of your making.
If there remains a drop or two of liquid tea that didn't come off with the draining, these are considered to be tears. It might indicate past or future sadness, dependent on the context of the rest of the reading.

, To do this, you will need to refer to the meanings of the symbols (images) found in the tea leaves. Once you understand these basics and, after practising the technique often, you will soon become adept at reading the leaves, even for images not set out in this article.


The most common images and their meanings can be found in this wikiHow list: wikiHow:Tea Leaf Symbols List.

Know whether you're processing steamed or pan fried tea.,
Roll the tea.,
Dry the tea.",How to Process Green Tea," This step is one of the most crucial techniques in order to ascertain the quality of the tea. This step has three most important goals to achieve; color, smell and taste. The idea is to completely destroy the activity of enzymes in the fresh leaves in order to put an end to the enzymatic oxidation of polyphenols. This  technique also achieves the characteristic glassy flavor for green tea in order to release its aroma and evaporate the water  content present in the fresh tea leaves. The procedure enhances the toughness of the leaves to prepare it for the next step rolling.;
, From the withering racks, the leaves are now twisted and rolled so that the leaf cells could be broken up. The purpose of rolling is to make the shape of the tea leaves tighter so that it is easier for them to follow the next step easily. The tea leaves are twisted in this stage in order to make their quality better for an easy brew to the tea liquor. Oils released during the process gives the distinct aroma to the tea leaves. In the case of green tea, the process of rolling is carried out with hands.

, The drying of the produced tea is responsible for many of its characteristic compounds. This is also the technique which improves its appearance. Firing the tea stops the process of oxidation. After the all the above mentioned steps are taken care of, and you get the final processed green tea which is ready to be brewed into a fragrant and sweet light tasting beverage.

Additionally, this tea may reduce the risk of tooth decay., Herbal teas are made from a variety of spices and flowers. These teas are caffeine-free and boast a wide range of homeopathic uses. When purchasing an herbal tea, choose a flavor that will pair well with lemon. For example:


Chamomile tea is commonly used as a sleep aid. This tea has bright flavors that blend wonderfully with lemon.
Cinnamon tea can sooth an upset stomach and stabilize blood sugar. However, some people don’t like the combination of cinnamon and lemon.
Ginger tea alleviates nausea and can lower your cholesterol. This tea is excellent with lemon juice., Some people believe that loose leaf tea is of a higher quality than bagged tea. However, when you use loose leaf tea, you must also use an infuser to keep all of the leaves in one place. If you purchase bags of tea, you don’t need to use an infuser.


A tea infuser is a small metal or plastic device that allows the tea leaves to steep without releasing them into the tea.

, Fill a medium sized saucepan with four cups of fresh water. Place the saucepan on your stove over medium-high heat and allow it to come to a boil.


Water is boiling when there are large active bubbles rising rapidly to the surface., Remove the boiling water from the heat. Next, add eight tea bags to the hot water. If you’re using loose leaf tea, add four tablespoons or eight grams of tea to a tea infuser before submerging it in the water.If your tea infuser is small, you may have to use more than one.


Follow the manufacturer instructions when using tea infusers.

, Cover the saucepan with a lid and allow the tea to steep. Each type of tea needs a certain amount of steeping time to allow the unique flavors to develop. Once the tea is done steeping, pull out any tea bags by the string or remove tea infusers with tongs.


White tea should steep for 30-60 seconds.
Green tea needs 1-3 minutes of steeping time.
Allow black tea to steep for 3-5 minutes.
Oolong tea should steep for 3-5 minutes.
Let herbal tea steep for 5-7 minutes., Once you’ve removed the tea leaves or bags, pour one cup (225 grams) of white sugar into your tea mixture. Use a long spoon to stir the mixture until the sugar has completely dissolved.If you have simple syrup, you can substitute about 1.5 cups of syrup for 1 cup of sugar.
You can also use brown sugar, but this will make the tea taste slightly earthier.

, The juiciest lemon flavors come from freshly squeezed lemon juice. Use your hands or a juicer to collect about a cup of lemon juice, usually using 3-4 lemons.If you don’t want to squeeze your own lemon juice, you can purchase it from your local grocery store.

, Leave the syrup on your stove for fifteen or twenty minutes to allow it to cool down. Stir it occasionally to help it cool faster. Once the syrup is warm instead of hot, you can use it to make tea.

, Choose a sturdy container that can hold a gallon of water (3.7 liters). Any plastic containers should have thick sides that won’t warp when the warm syrup is poured in. If you’re using a glass container, allow the syrup to cool to room temperature before using it or the container may crack., Add about four cups (946 milliliters) of fresh water to the gallon container, diluting the syrup. Use a long spoon to stir the mixture until the syrup has been completely incorporated into the water.For a strong, sweet flavor, use slightly less water to dilute the mixture.
For a light, refreshing flavor, use slightly more water in the mixture.

, Fill a tall glass with ice. Next, pour the warm tea mixture over the ice. The ice will quickly cool the tea. For a more intense tea flavor, use ice cubes made of the tea mixture.


If desired, garnish the glass with a lemon wedge or a sprig of mint.

, Cover the tea with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator. If the tea mixture is still warm, let it cool completely before refrigerating it. This will stop the tea from becoming cloudy while it chills.Drink the tea within 2-3 days. If you let it sit longer, the flavors won’t be as pure.

,,,, Add additional herbs if the flavor is not strong enough. Refrigerate if desired, to chill even more.

, You can add sugar or honey or rice syrup to your own taste. But it's a good idea to have a few sips first, as you may be pleasantly surprised by the herb's own flavors and feel that there is no need to add sweeteners.

Froth the milk, if desired.,
Pour the milk into the green tea.,
Enjoy.",How to Make Green Tea Latte1," Add the matcha to a mug capable of holding at least 8 oz (250 ml), passing the powder through a small sifter as you do.Matcha powder typically clumps up during storage, but sifting the powder into your cup should break up these clumps and make the green tea easier to dissolve.
Short, wide cups work better than tall, skinny cups. You'll need to manipulate the ingredients inside the cup using whisks and other tools, and fitting these tools into the cup will be easier when the cup has a wide mouth.;
, Fill a tea kettle with a small amount of water, then bring it to a near boil on the stove. Remove it from the heat and measure out 1/4 cup (60 ml).


The water should be ready immediately before the kettle whistles. If the tea kettle reaches a whistle, pour out the necessary 1/4 cup (60 ml) and let it rest for at least 60 seconds before continuing to the next step.
Simmer the water in a saucepan if you do not have a tea kettle.
Do not use boiling water for the next step. Matcha is somewhat delicate, and boiling water can actually have a negative effect on the taste and nutritional quality of the tea.

, Pour the hot water into the green tea powder. Use a bamboo whisk to combine the two ingredients until smooth, forming a paste-like green tea base for your latte.There should be no lumps remaining when you finish whisking these two ingredients together.
While bamboo whisks are the most conventional tool to use when preparing matcha drinks, you could also use a standard metal whisk if necessary. Similarly, a handheld frother would also combine the water and green tea powder effectively.

, Pour the milk into a small saucepan and add sugar or honey, if desired. Place the saucepan on the stove over medium heat and warm it until bubbles start to form around the edges.


Like the water, you should not allow the milk to reach a full boil. The milk should only reach a mild simmer. If you're checking with a thermometer, the ideal temperature is about 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius).You can use nearly any type of milk for this recipe, including whole milk, low-fat milk, non-fat milk, and non-dairy alternatives (almond milk, soy milk, coconut milk, etc.). You can also use half-and-half. Note, however, that milks lower in fat may not produce as much foam.

, To create a foamy latte, submerge a handheld milk frother into the warm milk and switch it on. Run the frother for about 30 seconds, or as needed to create your desired level of foam.


Dip the frother just beneath the surface of the milk to concentrate the process at the surface and produce more foam.
If you do not have a frother, vigorously whisking the milk using a standard metal whisk will also produce foam. Using a whisk will take longer than using a frother, though.
You can technically skip this step altogether, but doing so will result in a latte that lacks an initial layer of froth.

, Slowly pour the hot, foamy milk into the mug of green tea. Stir carefully to combine.


Use a stirring rod or spoon to combine the milk with the green tea base. Stir gently to avoid destroying the upper layer of foam.
If you did not froth the milk prior to adding it, you can whisk the green tea and milk together instead of stirring them. Doing so should also create a thin layer of foam on top of your latte.

, The green tea latte is finished and ready to drink.


Consider garnishing the latte with an additional sprinkle of matcha or a drizzle of honey.

Microwave the milk and water.,
Add the green tea powder and desired sweetener.,
Agitate the jar.,
Enjoy.",How to Make Green Tea Latte2," Combine the milk and water in a pint-sized (500-ml) microwave-safe mason jar. Microwave the jar uncovered for 2 minutes on full power.Watch the milk carefully as it heats in your microwave. It should begin bubbling, but should not be allowed to reach a full boil.
Whole-fat dairy milk will produce the most foam, but you can use nearly any type of milk, including non-dairy varieties like soy and nut milks. Just keep in mind that the amount of foam will decrease as the fat content decreases.
For this amount of latte, the jar should be pint-sized (500-ml) at minimum, but it can be larger than that if necessary.

, Sprinkle the matcha into the hot milk mixture. If you wish to add sugar or honey, do so now.


Since matcha can develop clumps as it sits, it's a good idea to sift the powder into the hot milk instead of adding it directly. Doing so should break up any lumps and make the powder easier to mix.
Green tea can be bitter on its own, so while sweeteners are not necessary, they are recommended. For this method, dry sweeteners like sugar and stevia generally work better than liquid sweeteners like milk or agave syrup.

, Seal the jar tightly with its lid, then shake the jar for a full 60 seconds or until the drink inside looks evenly combined and foamy.


Note that you may need to hold the jar using oven mitts or a tightly wrapped kitchen towel to protect your hands from the heat.
If you aren't using a jar with a lid, pour all of the ingredients into a small blender or submerge a handheld immersion blender into the cup. Process the ingredients for 10 to 20 seconds, or until evenly combined. The surface of the latte should also develop a thin layer of foam., Pour the green tea latte into a mug that holds at least 8 oz (250 ml). It should now be finished and ready to drink.


If desired, you can dust the surface with additional matcha powder or drizzle it with a dash of honey.

"
"
Combine the ingredients.,
Shake well.,
Add the remaining ice to serving glasses.,
Pour the latte into the glasses.,
Enjoy.",How to Make Green Tea Latte3," Place 1 cup (250 ml) of ice in the bottom of a cocktail shaker.Add the matcha, water, milk, and any desired sweetener to the shaker, as well.


Consider sifting the green tea powder into the shaker. Matcha may develop clumps as it sits, and breaking up these clumps before mixing the drink should allow the powder to disperse more evenly.
You can use any dairy or non-dairy milk for this drink. Iced lattes are naturally less foamy than hot lattes, but the type of milk used will further affect the amount of froth produced. Whole dairy milk will usually create the most, while non-fat dairy and non-dairy milks may produce very little.
Cocktail shakers work especially well for this process, but if you don't have one, the next best option would be a jar with a lid. If neither option is available, you can still prepare the iced latte in a wide-mouthed glass; combine all of the ingredients except the ice in a wide glass or bowl capable of holding at least 8 oz (250 ml).

, Close the shaker and vigorously shake it for at least 60 seconds. Check the contents; if ready, the drink should look evenly colored and foamy.


When preparing the drink in a glass instead of a cocktail shaker or sealable jar, vigorously whisk the matcha, milk, and water together using a bamboo or metal whisk. You can also combine the three ingredients using an immersion blender; process them together for approximately 10 to 20 seconds before continuing.

, Evenly divide the remaining 1 cup (250 ml) of ice between two serving glasses. Each glass must be able to hold a minimum of 1 cup (250 ml).


Alternatively, you can make one large latte instead of two smaller ones. Add all of the ice to a tall glass capable of holding at least 2 cups (500 ml).

, Pour the green tea latte through the shaker spout and into the prepared serving glasses, retaining the original ice rather than allowing it to enter the glasses.


For lattes mixed in a glass or bowl, simply pour the prepared drink over the ice. If it isn't as cold as you would prefer it to be, try chilling it in the refrigerator for 10 minutes or in the freezer for 1 to 2 minutes.

, The green tea latte should be finished and ready to drink.


If you were unable to produce a satisfactory amount of foam while mixing the drink, consider garnishing your iced latte with a small amount of whipped cream. Sprinkle the whipped cream or froth with additional matcha, if desired, to improve the overall presentation.

Start slowly.,
Brew your green tea half strength.,
Drink it hot.",How to Minimize Green Tea Caffeine," The most prized part of green tea is the terminal bud and the adjacent two leaves, also called the tea flush. They are the sweetest, but also contain the most caffeine.


Color is a poor indicator of caffeine levels - Gyokuro, a top level Japanese green tea, contains more caffeine than a dark tea such as Lapsang Souchong. High grade teas are made from the bud and two adjacent leaves (the tea flush), where the caffeine content is highly concentrated. On the plus side, these are the sweetest part of the tea and also contain the catechins and the theanine (mentioned below).;
, Many experts recommend consuming no more than 300 milligrams of caffeine a day. When compared to black teas, coffee and soft drinks, green tea has been found to provide a gentle and steady source of stimulation with few reports of common caffeine side effects, such as nervousness or headaches. Caffeine in green tea works differently in the body because unlike coffee, green tea also contains L-Theanine. Theanine is an amino acid that produces a calming effect on the brain (Yokogoshi et al. 1998b). Japanese researchers have discovered that theanine is a caffeine antagonist, offsetting the ""hyper"" effect of caffeine (Kakuda et al. 2000). Of the 20 different types of amino acids in tea, more than 60% are theanine. This is unique to green tea and white tea because the steaming process does not eliminate it. Theanine also provides the elegant taste and sweetness in green tea. To realize the cancer-fighting benefits of green tea, researchers generally agree that drinking 14-16 ounces (415-475 mL) per day is reasonable.. If there's is 30 mg of caffeine per 8 oz cup of green tea, drinking the recommended amount translates into 60 mg of caffeine per day (much less than 300 mg), and even that caffeine level can be reduced by following the instructions in this article. Here is a comparison of caffeine content is various beverages. Coffee (5 oz.cup) 40 - 170 mg.; Cola (12 oz. can) 30 - 60 mg.; Black Tea 8 oz. cup 25 - 110 mg.; Oolong Tea 8 oz. cup 12 - 55 mg.; Green Tea 8 oz. cup 8 - 30 mg.; White Tea 8 oz. cup 6 - 25 mg; Decaf Tea 8 oz. cup 1 - 4 mg.

, Some green tea's are processed in such a way as to be naturally low in caffeine. Here are three: 1) Japanese houjicha green tea is pan-fried or oven roasted. The tea is fried at high temperature and the roasted flavor predominates this blend. The main types of Houjicha are light and deep-fried. The deeper fried leaf produces a deeper roast aroma and taste. 2) Japanese genmaicha is a blend of bancha green tea and Genmai (roasted rice grain). The proportioning of tea to rice is important, the more aromatic Genmaicha teas have a higher amount of rice. 3) Japanese Bancha is a coarser and heavier grade of green tea, representing a late season crop. Bancha is a class of sencha harvested as a second flush tea between summer and autumn containing less caffeine. Caffeine comparisons per serving are as follows: Black Tea 0.05%; Gyokuro Green Tea 0.02%; Sencha Green Tea 0.015%; Houjicha Green Tea 0.008%; Genmaicha Green Tea.

, There are two types of de-caffeination processes used for tea. Be sure to purchase green tea that uses the far healthier natural decaffeination process called “effervescence.” It use no chemicals, and instead relies on a natural process using water and carbon dioxide (C02) that retains 95 percent of the polyphenols. The other process sometimes somewhat cynically referred to as ""natural decaffeination"" uses the chemical solvent ethyl acetate, retaining only 30 percent of the healthy polyphenols. Both coffee beans and tea leaves are chemically decaffeinated with ethyl acetate as a solvent/diluent, because of its low cost, low toxicity, and agreeable odor. However its other uses are to clean circuit boards, in some nail varnish removers and in paints as an activator . Note that any decaffeination process will alter the taste to some extent. Always check the label to ensure the effervescence or C02 process is used.

, Green tea teabags contain a lot more caffeine - and you will suffer some loss of quality as the teabags are poorer in flavor than the loose green tea leaves. Try to buy loose green tea leaves. You can use the same high-quality leaves three times before throwing them away.

, Some tea drinkers claim that steeping tea for 45 seconds, then pouring out the liquid, can remove a significant amount of caffeine.At least one study shows that this is probably not an effective method, and that you will need to steep your tea for 3 minutes to remove roughly half of the caffeine. This is worth considering if you are using especially strong-flavored tea, but weak green tea will lose much of its flavor and aroma after steeping it for this long.

, One cup of green tea can contain anywhere from 15 to 75 milligrams of caffeine. The best thing that you can do is to try green tea in small doses and monitor your own reactions. Start with a half of a cup per day and increase the amount gradually, observing your reaction to the increase and adjusting accordingly. If you feel calmly stimulated and content, you will know that green tea works for you.

, This can be a helpful solution if you are suffering from caffeine intolerance. Purchasing loose green tea will allow you to adjust how many leaves are brewed in your tea. Most people brew approximately one to two teaspoons of loose green tea per cup;you can try cutting that in half. If the resulting brew is too weak, increase it little by little.

, Green tea contains catechins (location of the antioxidants) and theanine (provides sweetness and freshness) that reduce caffeine activity. Brewing green tea allows these molecules to combine with caffeine in hot water, rendering the caffeine less effective. If you let it cool off too much after brewing, the catechins break down and more caffeine is released.

, Boil the water until it just reaches a simmer, then remove from heat and wait 30-60 seconds before using it, so it can cool down a bit.


The water temperature and quality of water you use to brew the tea are essential details to making a good cup of green tea., This is called warming the pot, and ensures the tea does not get cooled down by the pot itself., If possible, try to use loose tea leaves for higher quality tea, as opposed to tea bags.


The standard guideline is one teaspoon (3 grams) of tea for each 8 ounce cup of water. So if you are serving yourself, just use one teaspoon of tea. Adjust this amount based on the number of people you are serving., The steeping time depends on the type of green tea you are using. Generally, you should steep green tea for 1-3 minutes.Once the tea has been steeped enough, strain out the tea leaves.
Green tea that is steeped too long will taste bitter and have an unbalanced flavor. So try not to over steep the leaves.
If the tea tastes very mild, use more tea leaves or steep the leaves for a minute longer.

, Traditionally, Japanese green tea is always served in small, ceramic cups with white color inside, so you can see the color of the tea. Using ceramic cups is important because the pot and cups will affect the taste of the tea.A traditional Japanese tea service will place the pot, cooling vessel, cups, tea coasters, and cloth on a tray.
The size of the cups is also considered very important, as the smaller the cups, usually the higher the quality of the tea being served., The first pour of tea is weaker than the last pour of tea, so to ensure the flavor is equally distributed in each cup, fill each cup a third of the way. Then go back and fill the second third in each cup, and then finally fill each cup all the way. This is called ""cycle pouring"".Never pour someone a full cup of tea, as this is considered impolite. Ideally, the cup should be about 70% full., Green tea has a very robust flavor and if brewed properly, tastes delicious on its own.


If you always drink sweetened and flavored tea, the taste of ""raw"" green tea may seem off-putting at first, but try a few cups before making up your mind.

, Purchase small amounts only, and keep it in a cool spot. Green tea over six months old is no longer fresh.

, While this isn't necessary, it's a common practice for tea drinkers who regularly enjoy green tea because it prevents cross flavoring from black or herbal teas. If this doesn't bother you (indeed, you might not even notice the difference), just be sure to wash your regular teapot well.


Green tea should only be brewed in ceramic, clay, china, glass, or stainless steel teapots. Do not use plastic or aluminum teapots."

Add the loose green tea to a tea ball (a spoonful is adequate).,
Drop the tea ball into a cup or mug of freshly boiled hot water.,
Put a lid or plate over the cup or mug (unless you're already using a tea ball container equipped with a lid, also known as an ""infuser basket"").,
Remove the tea ball.

,
Serve.",How to Brew Green Tea2," A tea ball can also be dropped into a teapot for one or two if easier. Just be sure that the tea ball has the capacity for the amount of cups you're planning on brewing.

, The boiled water should be ""first boil"" (see the boiling instructions under ""Brewing loose green tea in a teapot"" for more details). The water should be allowed to sit for a moment as the ideal temperature for water for green tea is 180 °F (82 °C), 80C.

, This is when the water begins to boil but has not yet begun to simmer. The temperature at this stage will be 160ºF (71ºC). Bitter brews come from too high a temperature of water on green tea; prefer a longer steeping time at a cooler temperature instead.

,, Let it steep for three to five minutes. Three minutes steeping results in light flavor, while five minutes will give you a robust, full flavor. The longer the green tea is left in, the stronger the taste, so you might like to experiment as to which taste works best for you.


For high grade tea such as ""gunpowder"" types, steeping time may be as few as 10 seconds on first brew. You can reuse the leaves several times, steeping slightly longer with each batch. It is advisable to allow the leaves to rest for a few minutes after the first two brews so as not to burn or overwork them.
Always time the brewing and taste the tea rather than relying on color changes. Some green teas turn dark quickly but are not ready, while some stay light but are ready sooner than you may think.

, It is now ready to be enjoyed.


In addition, Chinese green tea connoisseurs will also use a snifter cup to enhance the tea drinking experience. These cups are much smaller in diameter but longer in length to allow the scent to waft into the nostrils as you sip out of your main cup.

, Rinse them to remove any residual dirt, bugs, or soil that may be on the leaves. Then, tear the leaves to help them release their aromas and give your tea a stronger flavor.


There are a variety of mint leaves you can use, including chocolate mint, spearmint, and peppermint., The mint leaves can go into a tea ball, a teapot designed for loose leaf tea, into a coffee filter, in a French press, or straight into a mug.

, Some teas should be done at different temperatures, so you don’t burn the leaves, but mint is hardy, and you can pour fully boiling water right over the leaves.

, Mint tea should steep for five to 10 minutes,but longer is fine if you want a stronger tea. Once your tea reaches the strength you like (either take a taste or go by the smell), remove the leaves. You can also leave the leaves in, and the tea will continue to get stronger. Use a strainer if desired to remove the loose leaves if you didn’t use a tea ball or special pot.


If you’re using a French press, push the plunger down when the tea has reached the desired strength.

, Once your tea has steeped, you can add honey or sweetener if you desire, or a splash of lemon before you drink it.

Try to pick leaves that are green and unblemished. If you bought a bunch of pre-cut peppermint stems, choose the healthiest looking leaves to pick off., Give the peppermint leaves a good rinse under the faucet. Even if you picked the peppermint from your own garden, you still want to make sure to wash off any dirt or impurities from the leaves., Use your hands to crush the peppermint by rubbing the leaves in between your fingers. Crushing the peppermint helps to release the flavor and aroma of the herb.You can also use the back of a spoon to lightly press and rub the leaves.
If you have a mortar and pestle, use the pestle to very lightly crush the leaves.
Makes sure not to overdo it when you crush the leaves. The leaves should look crumpled and slightly greener, not mashed to bits.

, Put the freshly crushed peppermint leaves into a mug. For every serving of tea, place 7-10 leaves in the mug, depending on how strong you like the tea., Boil water in an electric kettle, a stove top kettle, or a pot on the stove.

Make sure that all the leaves are submerged in the water, then cover the mug., If you prefer mild tea, steep for 7 minutes. If you prefer strong tea with a robust peppermint flavor, leave the peppermint in for the full 12 minutes.

, After the tea has finished steeping, remove the leaves. You can take them out either by fishing them out with a spoon, or by straining the tea into another mug so that all the leaves get caught in the strainer.

, Your tea is now ready! If you like putting extras in your tea like honey, milk or lemon, add them right after straining. Otherwise, enjoy your fresh cup of peppermint tea!

Enjoy!",How to Make Moroccan Tea," Fill a tea kettle or small saucepan with 1 cup of water, and bring it to a boil on the stove over medium-high heat.You can prepare the full amount of water during this step, but you'll only use 1 cup (240 ml) when activating the tea leaves. The rest of the water may need to be reheated before use.
Note that the water should be between 158°F and 176°F (70°c and 80°c).;
, Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) of boiled water into the clean teapot. Swirl the water around slightly to rinse and warm the pot.If possible, try to use a Moroccan teapot. Moroccan teapots vary in size, but a small pot typically holds about a half liter (six glasses) of tea, while a larger pot holds approximately a liter (12 glasses); you can also use an ordinary teapot if you don't have a Moroccan one. Flameproof teapots are ideal when available.

, Place the tea leaves in the tea pot. You'll need about 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of loose gunpowder tea for every 6 oz (177ml) of hot water. If following the quantities noted in this recipe, add the full amount of leaves.


Chinese gunpowder tea is the most conventional, but if you are unable to find this tea, you could prepare a similar version of this drink using other loose green tea leaves or green tea bags. Use at least 2 tea bags for every 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of loose tea if choosing this option., Add boiling water to the tea pot, directly over the tea leaves currently in the pot. Swirl the pot gently to warm, rinse, and activate the tea leaves., Allow the tea to steep in the hot water for about 30 seconds.For a stronger flavor, you might consider letting it steep for as long as 1 or 2 minutes.

, Swirl the pot to wash and rinse the tea leaves, then carefull strain the water out through the spout of the tea pot, keeping the leaves in the pot.


The drained liquid is not Moroccan tea. This initial portion of water only rinses the leaves.
Some tea pots have strainers in them; others do not. If your pot does not have its own strainer, make sure that you pour the contents through a separate strainer to collect the leaves and return them to the pot.

, This includes mint leaves and the sugar. Add them directly to the wet tea leaves in the pot.


Try to find a Middle Eastern grocery store. Moroccan mint has a different taste than most other mints. If you are unable to find Moroccan mint, use any spearmint or peppermint.
Cane sugar is best. Dextrose will also work if you don't wish to use cane sugar, but you'll need to double the quantities of sugar to ensure sweetness.

, If you boiled the water previously and it still feels hot enough, you can add it immediately. If not, boil the remaining 4 cups (1 L) before adding it to the pot.


Leave the tea to steep for about 5 minutes.If you have a Moroccan teapot or a heatproof teapot, rather than steeping, set the teapot over low heat and bring the tea to a low simmer. Then, immediately remove from the heat, and allow to steep several minutes more.

, Pour it back into the teapot. Do this three or more times. This helps dissolve the sugar., Doing this will help to create a thin layer of foam on the top. When pouring, make sure the tea pellets stay with the tea inside the pot. Only fill the cup two-thirds full; this enables the aroma to develop fully.

, After pouring the remaining tea, garnish the tea with extra mint (if available). This is an optional step but makes it look fantastic, especially if you have proper Moroccan glasses."

To make a single serving, use the same mint–water ratio and method as you would for a mug of hot mint tea.

, Once the tea is ready, squeeze the lemon juice into the tea, making sure you don’t get any seeds in the tea. Add your sweetener of choice, to taste, if you want sweet tea. Stir vigorously to break down the sugar particles.


Agave nectar also works well as a liquid sweetener and honey substitute.

, Once it’s cool, strain the tea into a pitcher and discard the used mint leaves. Refrigerate until it’s cold., When the tea has chilled, and you are ready to serve it, fill your glasses with ice. Thinly slice a cucumber and add a few slices to each glass. Pour the tea and enjoy.

You can also add 5 or so spearmint leaves, which gives the tea a slightly sharper flavor.

, After you have added the teabags or mint leaves, turn on the burner to medium heat. Heating up the teabags or the peppermint leaves in the water helps to make the tea stronger., Bring the tea to a boil, then turn the heat down slightly and let it boil for about five minutes.

, Dried mint can be used to make teas, and can even be put into the reusable cups for single-serve coffee machines. Take the fresh sprigs of mint and loosely bundle a couple together with elastic bands. Hang them upside down somewhere warm and dry until the leaves are dry and brittle.Mint contains more moisture than some other herbs, which means it can take anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks to dry, depending on the climate. The warmer and dryer the room you use for drying, the less time the process will take.When the leaves are dry, place them in a bag or between sheets of wax paper and break them up.

You can also mix 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 grams) of instant coffee with enough water to dissolve it.


The coffee needs to be really strong because you are only using a small amount. If it's not strong enough, then your frappuccino won't have that traditional coffee flavor.
Skip this step if you are making a crème frappuccino.

, Let the espresso or coffee reach room temperature fist, then chill it in the fridge or freezer. Once it is nice and cold, take it out and pour it into a blender.

, ¾ cup (180 milliliters) would be ideal, however. Whole milk is the standard, but you can also try 2% or nonfat. If you can't have dairy, you can use soy milk or another type of non-dairy milk. Other options also include:

1 scoop of ice cream (preferably vanilla or coffee)
¾ cup (180 milliliters) of sweetened condensed milk
¾ cup (180 milliliters) of milk mixed with heavy whipping cream

, Vanilla smoothie or vanilla soft-serve ice cream mix will get you pretty close to the actual flavor. You can also try ½ pack of vanilla instant pudding mix or 2 tablespoons of maple syrup.

A pinch of xantham gum can also be used a thickener.Skip this step if you are using ice cream, sweetened condensed milk, or creamer as your dairy.

, For a smoother frappuccino, use just 1 cup (140 grams). For a thicker one, try 2 cups (280 grams) instead. Make things easier on your blender by using crushed ice, if you can., Start with 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of your favorite syrup; if you decide that the drink is not sweet enough after you blend it, you can always stir in more later. Chocolate is a popular choice. Other popular choices include: caramel, hazelnut, and vanilla.You can use vanilla extract instead of vanilla syrup. Start with 1 to 2 teaspoons.

, If you need to, pause the blender and scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula. Keep blending until the mixture is smooth. This should only take about 30 seconds or so.

, Many people like garnishes on top of their frappuccinos, but you can leave yours plain if you want to. You can drizzle some chocolate or caramel sauce on top for something simple. If you want a fancier drink, add a swirl of whipped cream on top, then add some chocolate or caramel sauce. You can also add tiny curls or shavings of chocolate instead.


Match the sauce to the flavor of your frappuccino. If you made a mocha frappuccino, use chocolate syrup on top.
If you made a different flavor, such as vanilla or hazelnut, you can skip the sauce altogether, or you can use a complimentary flavor, such as chocolate.

Purging the steam wand causes any water previously trapped in the system to drain. This prevents that water from tainting the texture or taste of the milk.

, Position the pitcher so that the steam wand touches the surface of the milk, dipping slightly beneath it.The steam wand and milk should meet at an approximate 15 degree angle.
The goal is reduce the amount of air introduced into the milk at the surface, thereby preventing dry foam from forming on top while creating tinier bubbles all throughout the milk.

, Switch on the steamer function to full pressure. Stretch the milk as it steams by moving the tip of the wand around the surface.


The volume of the milk will gradually increase. You'll need to keep the tip of the wand beneath the milk the entire time, though.
If the process is working correctly, it should sound similar to the noise paper makes when being torn.

, Once the volume of the milk has increased by roughly two-third, dunk the tip of the steam wand further beneath the surface.


Tilt the pitcher further, stopping at an angle that creates a rapid spin in the milk. During this time, the fine air bubbles you previously created in the milk will be mixed throughout.

, Keep one hand on the side of the pitcher during the process. When the metal pitcher becomes too hot to comfortably touch, the milk should be ready. Switch off the steamer and remove the pitcher.


More precisely, the milk should reach a temperature of approximately 153 degrees Fahrenheit (67 degrees Celsius). The maximum temperature is 158 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius).Use a food thermometer if you want to be precise.
After removing the pitcher, purge the steam wand as you did before and wipe it clean with a damp cloth.

, Gently swirl the pitcher in your hand and knock the bottom against the table or counter once or twice.


Agitating the milk in this manner should pop any large air bubbles.
The texture and appearance of the milk should cause it to look similar to wet paint.

, Pour the milk into a 2-qt (2-L) saucepan. Set the saucepan on your stove.

, Turn on the burner to medium heat. Warm up the milk until it reaches a gently simmer.


The temperature of the milk when you prepare the flat white should be no more than 158 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius). It can be a little hotter at this stage since it will cool slightly when you whisk it, but not by much.
Use a food thermometer if you want to achieve a greater level of precision.

, Switch off the heat and remove the saucepan from the stove. Whisk well, using a wire whisk, until the milk becomes notably frothy and nearly doubles in volume.As you whisk, make sure that you are folding any froth you create on the surface of the milk back into the liquid. The process can take several minutes and may require practice to perfect, but when done well, you should have an even layer of velvety foam with very small bubbles., Carefully tap the bottom of the saucepan against the counter to dislodge and pop any large bubbles from the milk.


The goal is to create a smooth, even microfoam throughout the entire pan of milk. It should look similar to glossy, wet paint when ready.

, Pour the milk from the saucepan into a small syrup pitcher or into a liquid measuring cup with a spout.


You need to be able to create a steady stream of milk when you pour it into the espresso later on. As such, a container with a spout makes the process significantly easier.

, Remove the portafilter from the group head at the front of the machine. Place 1/4 oz (7 g) of coffee grounds in the portafilter and pack them in.


Each machine is a little different, but usually, you will need to remove the portafilter by twisting the handle to the left and pulling it straight down.
Use a temper to press the grounds into the portafilter. Press down on them at least twice to make sure that they are as packed as possible.
You can technically use previously ground coffee, but for the freshest flavor, grind fresh coffee beans immediately before you prepare the drink.
While you can technically use any roast you prefer, medium to light roast coffee beans are strongly recommended., Secure the filled portafilter back into the group head at the front of the machine.


The method for replacing the portafilter is essentially the reverse of removing it. Your machine may vary, but typically, you need to push the portafilter up into the correct position and twist it to the right until it feels tight.
Place a wide-mouthed coffee cup beneath the portafilter spout, as well. This cup will be the one used for your white flat.

, Fill the water tank with enough water for your shot of espresso. In this case, 1 fluid ounce or 2 Tbsp (30 ml) should suffice.


There are different ways to fill the water tank, and the correct method will depend on your machine. You may need to pour the water through a tray at the top of the machine. Alternatively, you may need to remove the water tank, fill it, then secure it back in place.

, Turn on the hot water knob. The water should warm up and the machine should begin to brew the espresso shot.


Usually, you will need to switch the knob to a halfway setting for 5 seconds to 10 seconds to let the water heat up. Afterward, turn the knob to its maximum setting.

, The machine should pour the shot of espresso from the portafilter spout within 30 to 35 seconds.


Turn the hot water knob off after your shot has been poured.
If you have more water in the tank than necessary, you should switch the machine off once the espresso starts looking pale or inconsistent in color.

, Scoop 1 tsp (5 ml) of instant coffee and place it in a wide-rimmed coffee cup.


This should be a rounded spoonful, not an even one.

, Pour one shot of very hot water over the instant coffee. Use a spoon to mix the two ingredient together until the coffee granules have dissolved.One shot of hot water is equal to 1 fluid ounce or 2 Tbsp (30 ml).

, Position the spout of the pitcher or measuring cup as close to the surface of the espresso as possible without actually breaking the surface.

, Pour the microfoam into the espresso using a steady hand.


Note that the entire process should be done at a relatively quick pace to prevent the microfoam from separating.
Improve your control over the microfoam by placing a finger on either side of the pitcher as you pour.
With enough skill and practice, you can even learn to create latte art while pouring the milk. For now, however, you merely need to focus on pouring the milk evenly over the surface of the espresso shot.
The milk will blend into the surface of the espresso shot, creating a very creamy coffee. A little of the microfoam will be visible from the surface, but the majority should sink and blend into the drink.

, Your flat white is now ready. Drink it immediately to enjoy the best flavor and texture.

",How to Make English Tea," This is by far the most important step to making perfect British tea. Ideally, go to a tea store and buy a good quality brand of tea. British tea is made with black tea leaves, so look for that when buying your tea. Earl Grey is one tried and true classic, but many English people also drink what's just called ""black tea,"" or occasionally ""breakfast tea"" or ""British tea.""


Some of the go-to British brands include PG Tips, Tetley's, and Yorkshire Tea.
If you want to buy tea leaves, rather than bags, that works, too; you'll need either a teapot or an infuser (for use with a cup). Most English people don't bother with the added hassle of loose leaf tea, but some swear by it.
Be aware that English tea is often stronger than ones made in America or other countries, so look for an imported brand if you are located outside Britain but want real British strength.;
, Use freshly drawn water - using the old water in the kettle can result in scaly, scummy tea. You can boil in an electric kettle, a stovetop kettle, or even a pot if needed. Microwaving the water isn't recommended, but is also doable.


If you have a temperature controlled kettle, you want the water to be at least 200 degrees(F) or 93 degrees(C).

, While the water is boiling, prepare your receptacle.


If you're using mugs, put a teabag in each mug. Very few people use cups and saucers at home. Big mugs (beakers) are usual, for an everyday cup of tea.
If you want to make tea in a teapot, warm the teapot with hot water first (fill it, and then drunk it out), and then add one teabag per person. This ensures that your tea will stay hot longer.
If you're making tea with loose-leaf tea in a pot, add 1 teaspoonful of tea per cup, plus one extra teaspoonful for the pot. Generally speaking, 3 teaspoonfuls of good quality tea in a two-cup teapot works fine. Some people say 3 grams of loose tea per person makes the perfect cup of tea.

, It is essential that the water is boiling, in order to release all the flavour of the tea. Don't settle for warm or even plain hot tea; make sure it's boiling.

, The tea needs time to develop its flavour. This is called brewing, steeping or drawing. Let stand for a minute or two for a cup of tea, or 3 to 5 minutes for a pot.

, It can be added to your garden compost bin.


Never squeeze the tea bag; simply remove and throw away. Squeezing it will release a bitter taste into your tea.

, Depending on which way you brew the tea, the milk is important. Most people opt for semi-skimmed (low-fat) pasteurised milk these days; however, to achieve the classic taste, use fully sterilised milk.


Look for the right colour. The perfect cup of tea will have a dark orange-brown look once the milk has been added and stirred. It will be the perfect temperature to drink after 3 to 5 minutes.

Use ½ the amount of ginger, cardamom, cloves and cinnamon if you are using ground spices.;
, Measure out ½ cup (118.3 ml) dried cardamom pods and place them on a cutting board. Use a small, sharp paring knife to make a small incision through one side of each pod of cardamom. Then place the pods in the bowl with the other spices.Making a cut through the cardamom pods ensures that the flavor of the cardamom seeds within the pods can escape and spice the tea.

, Break each cinnamon stick into smaller pieces, about 4 pieces for each stick of cinnamon. If you are using thin cinnamon sticks, you can break them by hand. If you are using thicker cinnamon sticks, use gardening sheers or a large steak knife to cut through the sticks.

You can also substitute ¼ cup (59.15 ml) of ground cinnamon in place of whole cinnamon sticks.

, Place the pieces of cinnamon stick into a spice grinder and grind the cinnamon. Grind until the cinnamon becomes a coarse, crumbly mixture. Then add the cinnamon to the rest of the spices.You don’t need to make the cinnamon a fine powder, you just need to grind it enough so that you can stir the cinnamon chunks into the rest of the masala.

Pour cool water on the bottom of the tray.,
Flex the ends of the tray in opposite directions.,
Lick your finger and touch an ice cube to lift it out.,
Dump the ice into a bowl.,
Don’t overfill the tray.,
Don’t stack ice cube trays.,
Clean out trays before refilling them.,
Try a soft silicone tray.",How to Remove Ice Cubes From a Tray," Regardless of what kind of ice cube tray you're using, it’s always a good idea to start by running some cool water over the underside of the tray.This will help break the seal that’s keeping the ice cubes stuck to the tray material.


Don’t use hot or even warm water, otherwise, you might melt the ice. Hold the ice cube tray over the sink and run water from the tap over the bottom of the tray.
Place a bowl or colander in the sink under the ice cubes in case any come loose and fall out.;
, Flip the ice cube tray over so it’s right-side up. Hold one end of the tray in either hand and gently twist each end of the tray in opposite directions. With one hand, flex the tray away from you while flexing it toward you with the other hand. Release the flex, then twist the sides in the other direction.Flexing the tray like this allows air to enter between the ice and the tray, which will release the cubes from their pockets.If you have an old metal tray with a lever on it, pull up the lever to shift the metal divisions and release the ice., To remove a single ice cube from the tray, lick the tip of your index finger.While it’s still wet, tap your finger onto the ice cube you want. The liquid on your finger will freeze upon contact with the ice and form a bond,so when you lift your finger, the ice cube will easily come out of its pocket attached to your finger.


To get the cube off, simply dip the tip of your finger into your drink and allow the bond to melt.

, If you want all or some of the ice from the tray and not just a single cube, position the tray over a wide-mouthed bowl. Hold the tray in one hand and use the other hand to cover the ice that you want to remain in the tray, then flip the tray over so the ice falls out into the bowl.


If necessary, give the bottom of the tray a quick bang with your hand if some of the cubes are still stuck.

, Ice cube trays have individual pockets for each ice cube for a reason, and making sure the water stays within the boundary of each pocket will help make your ice cubes easier to get out of the tray when they're frozen.


If the water in the ice cube trays is connected, it will freeze as one large block of ice, which will be harder to break up and remove from the tray., When you stack ice cube trays on top of one another, cold air from the freezer can't get in between the trays, will causes the ice cubes in the bottom tray to freeze from the bottom up. Because water expands when it freezes, the bottom will then expand into the bottom of the tray, thereby sticking to the tray.If you need multiple batches of ice for a party or special recipe, freeze the ice cube trays one at a time, and then stack them once they're all frozen.

, People will often refill a half-full ice cube tray to make sure they have enough ice, but this can cause the ice to stick to the tray. Instead, empty the ice cube tray completely and let it dry out before adding fresh water to make more ice.Once frozen, ice can always be transferred to a sealable plastic bag or freezer-safe container if you need to free up the tray to make more ice.

, While ice cube trays were traditionally made of metal, plastic is now the material of choice. However, some newer ice cube trays are made of a pliable silicone, and these can be great for ice because you can actually poke or pinch the bottom of each ice cube pocket to release it from the tray.To remove ice cubes from a silicone tray, flex both sides of the tray to loosen the cubes. Hold the tray in both hands, and place an index or middle finger under a single ice cube on the bottom of the tray. Push against the bottom of the cube with that finger, and the ice cube will pop out. Grab it with your other hand while still pushing it from the bottom.
Silicone trays work best when they are clean and don’t have a cloudy residue inside, so wash them out with hot soapy water and a brush between every filling."

Hold the chopstick one-third of the way from the top.
Rest the chopstick against the forefinger of your middle finger. The tip of your thumb should be pressed against the chopstick, holding it in place, and the forefinger of your index finger should lie flat against the top of the chopstick.;
, The second chopstick should point in the same direction as the first, and the tips should be evenly aligned.









Rest this chopstick in the crevice between your thumb and index finger, with the chopstick leaning more toward the base of your thumb than toward the base of your index finger.
The other side of the chopstick should rest against the top of your ring finger. Your ring finger should be positioned roughly one-third of the way down from the top of the chopstick.

, Press up on the upper chopstick using the top or forefinger of the middle finger.









Your index finger will also move with the chopstick and middle finger.
Only the pointed tips of the chopsticks should open. The blunt tops should actually move closer to each other without actually touching.

, Press down on the upper chopstick using the top portion of your index finger, drawing the two tips back together.









Your middle finger will also move along with the chopstick and index finger.
When picking up a piece of food, place the open chopsticks on either side of the food so that the food is centered between them. Close the chopsticks around the food so that the middle of the morsel is wedged between the tips.

,


Your lower chopstick should also remain still throughout the process.

, Disposable wooden chopsticks, or waribashi, need to be removed from their paper wrapper and split apart.









A common practice is to rub the disposable chopsticks against each other in order to remove stray splinters. You can do this if you are not among polite company, but this practice, known as kosuri-bashi, is actually considered to be a chopstick taboo and should usually be avoided.

, Your chopsticks should be positioned side-by-side, sitting horizontally in front of you. Use your dominant hand to pick the chopsticks up, holding them together.









Grasp the chopsticks from the top, with the back of your hand facing you.
Your thumb and index finger should be placed roughly one-third of the way down from the top of your chopsticks. Your pinky should be near the top of the chopsticks.

Position the chopsticks with your left hand so that the tips are closed together and the blunt tops are slightly spread apart.

, Slide your non-dominant hand out from beneath the chopsticks. Your chopsticks are now ready to be used.









Open and close your chopsticks around food using the same method you practiced with.

, An important part of holding chopsticks is knowing what size chopsticks your hands need. There is a big difference between chopsticks meant for adult male hands and those meant for a child's hands.


Standard chopsticks given at a Japanese restaurant are 9 in (23 cm) long. These are sized for the standard adult male's hand, however.
Most adult women need chopsticks that are closer to 8 1/4 in (21 cm) long.
Ideally, kids should use chopsticks that vary in size depending on how old they are. Kids between the ages of 1 and 2 should use chopsticks that are 5 in (13 cm) in length. At 3 years old, most kids need 5 1/2 in (14 cm) chopsticks, and 4-year-old kids usually need chopsticks that are 6 in (15 cm) long. This pattern continues as the child ages. By the age of 12 or 13, most children use chopsticks that are 8 in (20 cm) long.

, Hold your thumb out so that if form a 90 degree angle with your index finger. Measure the distance between the tip of your thumb and the tip of your index finger in centimeters.


You need to take this measurement in centimeters. The math will not work if you use inches.
While there are standard sizes, the best way to make sure that you have the correct size is to measure your hand and determine what you need from there.

, The resulting number will be the length you need in centimeters.


If desired, you can convert this measurement to inches by multiplying it by 0.39.,









Do not lay your chopsticks over the plate or dish when finished. This action is referred to as watashi-bashi, and it is considered taboo.Similarly, you should not stick your chopsticks vertically into a dish of rice or other food. This taboo is known as tate-bashi.


, Chopsticks are used to grasp food. You should not use them to poke food as you would do with a fork.









This taboo is known as sashi-bashi or tsuki-bashi.

, Dishes should be passed by hand, not by grabbing at them with chopsticks.









This taboo is known as yose-bashi.


, This action is actually performed at funerals and involves the bones of a cremated body. It is not appropriate to do it with food.









A formal name for this taboo is utsushi-bashi or hiroi-bashi.

, Do not let them roam around as you decide. This taboo practice is known as mayoi-bashi.









Similarly, if you move your chopsticks to a dish, you must grab something from it. Not grabbing any food is a taboo known as sora-bashi.

Use the side of the spoon.,
Eat slowly and gently.,
Keep your grip firm.,
Use your spoon for the right dishes.,
Place your spoon on your plate when finished.,
Do not use your fingers.,
Avoid pointing with your spoon.",How to Hold a Spoon," Most people use their right hand when reaching for a spoon.However, you want to be able to control your motions carefully. Therefore, it's best to use your dominant hand.


Be careful if you're sitting next to someone whose dominant hand is different from your own. Be conscientious of your movements to avoid accidentally knocking elbows with them.;
, You want to hold your spoon horizontally as you move it. This will prevent food from spilling while you eat. Keep your spoon steady with the first knuckle of your index finger and the tip of your middle finger, holding it at a horizontal angle., Curl your middle finger, ring finger, and pinky fingers inward and lay the handle of the spoon overtop the middle finger, with the dome of the spoon pointing towards your other hand. Rest the portion of the spoon's handle right before the head on your index finger. Allow the end of the handle to rest on the curve made by your thumb., Place your thumb and index finger on top of the end of the spoon. Press down on the end so that the spoon is held between the top of your middle finger and your thumb and index finger. This should keep the spoon secure while you're eating and drinking., Holding the spoon like this allows you a greater field of motion. When you turn your wrist away from you the spoon will dip downwards, into your food, and when you turn it towards you, the spoon will turn back up.


This is a more flexible position than if you held the spoon in, say, a fist, or between your thumb and index finger.

, Bring the spoon to your mouth and eat from the broad side of the spoon, rather than the tip. You can use your wrist here to tilt the spoon upwards to aid in eating., Foods that you eat with a spoon are frequently liquid based. It is easy to make slurping noises when eating with a spoon. To minimize noise when eating, eat very slowly. Make sure to open your mouth wide enough to get food in without having to resort to slurping.Eating food slowly will also help you best enjoy the taste and texture of your food.

, Make sure to grip firmly on your spoon when you eat. Keeping a loose grip can cause you to drop your spoon, which can cause a mess and loud noises. Keep your grip firm enough that the spoon does not wobble in your hands while you eat., Spoons are used to eat liquid-based food, such as soups. Spoons are also used to eat mushier, softer foods such as ice cream and mashed potatoes. Use your spoon for these types of foods and avoid using it to eat solid foods. It can be hard to maneuver foods like meats and vegetables using a spoon., When you're done, it's customary to set your spoon down on your plate. Always plate your spoon on the plate from which you were eating. If you were eating soup, place the spoon on the plate your soup bowl was resting on.In general, you should not place your spoon back in a bowl when you finish eating. This could confuse waitstaff, as they may think you're still eating. However, if no plate was provided, it's okay to put your spoon back in the bowl. You do not want to get food residue on the table.

, Never push food onto your spoon using your fingers. This is considered bad table manners. If you have to push food to eat with a spoon, it is probably better to use a fork for this type of food., Never use your spoon to point at other guests while talking or otherwise gesticulating. Only use your spoon for eating. If you're using your hands to do things like gesticulate while at the table, set your spoon down while doing so."

However, you may want to feel different sizes of chopsticks to see what length works best for your hands.You can cut your dowel rods with sharp shears or a small saw.Make sure to use a sharp object to cut the rods, that you use a cutting board, that you keep your fingers away from any blade, and that you have a firm grip on the rod so it does not slip when you cut it.

, Use a blade to shave off pieces of the wood at an angle. Start about half way through the chopstick and keep shaving down to the end of the chopsticks. You want both chopsticks to come to a point about a half inch in diameter.


Cut away from you with the knife, not toward you.

, Make sure there are no splinters or rough edges on your chopsticks. File them with a sanding block to smooth them out."

Cut the chopsticks.",How to Make Chopsticks at Home2," Chopsticks can be made of many types of wood (such as aspen, chestnut, pine, cedar, cherry, sandalwood, and paulownia). The wood used needs to be hard and resistant to water., Slice the wood with an axe so that the grains are straight. Cut your wood to a 1.5”x.5”x11” block. Roughly shape the block of wood with a 14” plane (a hand tool for shaping wood) and then slice it in half with an axe.Each stock should be slightly larger than a quarter inch thick., Use a 9” plane to set the chamfer, a symmetrical sloping edge. Do this to one end of each chopstick. Finish shaping the chopsticks with a 6” smoothing plane. This will get rid of any rough wood and make the chopsticks smooth. Round the tips with the smoothing plane., Typically, chopsticks are around 10 inches long, but you can cut them to the length that you are comfortable with. Slightly chamfer the ends to finish the chopsticks."

You can carve in simple lines on the chopsticks or something more elaborate if you know how to wood carve., Make sure to get a finish that is non-toxic since the chopsticks will be coming in contact with food. Apply a coat and then let the chopsticks dry for 30 minutes. Re-apply any varnish to areas that look like they need more. Let the chopsticks dry thoroughly, this could take a day or more.


You can reapply every year or two to renew the stain, water protection, and make the chopsticks look new., You can paint your chopsticks when you are finished making them. You can paint the whole thing or just parts of them. Use whatever type of paint; you want just make sure to get non-toxic paint, especially if you are eating with the chopsticks. Use clear tape to mask off any areas of the chopsticks you don’t want to paint. Apply several coats of paint. Peel of any tape when the paint is completely dry., You can decorate your chopsticks with washi tape. Pick washi tape that you like and wrap it around the chopsticks. Wrap the tape around only the ends if you plan on eating with the chopsticks."

Use the appropriate cutlery.,
Be polite.,
Learn to pass items.,
Take one roll or one slice of bread only.,
Place your napkin next to your plate on the table when you wish to leave.",How to Have Good Table Manners," Follow their lead. The key objective in learning table manners (etiquette) is to feel comfortable when dining with others, and the host generally the leader at a dinner party or meal. If you are the host, don't panic. Ensure you read up on etiquette before taking on the role of hosting and operate within the boundaries so that you are easy to follow.;
, He or she may assign you to a seat. Stand behind the chair as the other guests get assembled. When the host sits, take your seat. You'll get extra points for helping others, such as the elderly, into their seats before you take yours. After you sit, pull your chair in to the table, without dragging it over the floor with a horrible scrape. Take your napkin from the table immediately, and place it neatly on your lap. Then sit up straight, just like Mom always tells you. And keep those pesky elbows off the table, too.

, Put your napkin in your lap when you see them doing it. Match their rate of eating. (After all, no one wants to have an empty plate when their host is only halfway done with the dish.) If you see them eating finger food with a fork, follow their lead - even if it seems unreasonable. Assume that your host is always right; unless you can definitely tell that they have bad manners, in which case you may follow another guest.

, If there are many utensils in your place setting and there is more than one course, start on the outside and work your way in. Again, observe your host if you have any doubts.

, Consider every action before you do it and if you have the slightest doubt, don't do it! You must consciously refrain from embarrassing yourself and your host. Take small bites; do not chew with your mouth open; do not talk with food in your mouth; and do not place elbows on the table.

, When someone says, ""Please pass the (what you would like passed to you),"" reach for it only if you are the closest one to it. Take the item and place it next to your neighbor. Continue passing the item in this manner until it reaches the person who asked for it. Refrain from helping yourself along the way, before the person who asked for it gets the chance. Wait politely until they have served themselves. Then ask for the bowl to be passed back to you.

, If you have a bread plate to the left of your fork, put the bread on it. When the butter is passed to you, use the serving knife to take a pat. Place it on your bread plate. Then pass the butter dish along with the serving knife to the next person. Use your fingers to tear off a bite-size piece of bread. Butter only that bite-sized piece. Then eat and repeat as desired.

, Wait for your host to indicate the meal is complete. Then stand up. Push your chair back in and thank your host for a delicious meal.

Avoid letting the situation happen in the first place.,
Apologize.,
Considering buying a replacement.",How to React when You Spill Someone's Drink," You are most likely to spill someone's drink when you are making magnanimous gestures, carrying a few drinks of your own, or if you are feeling buzzed. So remember to be observant at these high risk moments. If you do spill someone's drink, do not ignore it, but act quickly to assess the situation and defuse any hostile vibrations.;
, If you have just spilled someone's drink, you should apologize immediately and unreservedly. If they are a decent type, this should stop them from getting too agitated.

Find a place that sells alcohol.,
Take a seat.,
Find the bar.,
Approach the bar.,
Wait.,
Place your order.,
Pay.",How to Order Alcohol," You can't order alcohol if you show up to a place that doesn't actually serve it. To avoid having to drink orange juice, make sure the place that you're going to sells alcohol. The best places are bars, clubs and some restaurants. They practically make all their money off of alcohol so you'll be sure that they sell it.;
, Before you run off to the bar, take a seat with your buddies. Spend a few minutes deciding what you're going to order. If you and your friends are buying rounds and you're paying first, you will have to order everyone's drinks. Make a mental or physical note of what they want. If you're not buying rounds, you'll just have to buy your own drink.

, The bar isn't usually hard to miss. It's the most important part of a pub or club. Make a quick scan of the building with your eyes to find it. There could be speakers or TVs to attract people to it and there could be a long line or a cluster of people waiting to order. If you're having trouble, ask one of your friends to help you look for it.

, Now's the scary part; making your way to the bar. Don't forget everyone's drinks under the pressure. If it helps, ask a friend to walk there with you. It's probably a good idea to go in twos, you don't want to be hassled by a load of drunks on your first time, do you? Walk to the bar like you'd walk anywhere else; don't try to do a gangster walk, you're not cool yet. When approaching the bar, have your money in your hand and keep your wallet safe and out of view.

, Now that you're at the bar, you have to wait for the waiter to take your order. If there are lots of people around, this could take some time. Don't shove your way to the front and don't call the waiter over, just wait your turn. If you're alone, however, kindly call the waiter over if they haven't already seen you. Never click your fingers for the waiter, it's extremely rude and they probably won't serve you. Just a polite ""over here mate"" will do.

, Once the waiter's come over to you, they'll probably say something along the lines of ""How can I help you?"". Now's the time to place your order. Tell the waiter how many drinks you'd like and what drinks you want. Just saying ""three drinks"" over and over will annoy them, be clear on what drink you want. Try to avoid changing your mind last minute, it can be hard if they've already poured the drink and they might still charge you for it.

, After you've got all of the drinks, the waiter will tell you the price. If you're in a pub, it could be quite expensive. Don't freak out, just pay the bill. If you would like to, leave a small tip. It doesn't have to be a huge amount, £1 or two will do. For example, if your drinks come up to £18.50, give a £20 note, smile, and say ""keep the change"". Be sure to make it clear that you're leaving a tip, not just forgetting your change. If you would not like to tip the waiter, just wait for your change. Enjoy your drinks.

, Don't leave your meal unpaid. You might be in a big trouble if you do so.

Practice with chewing gum.,
Start out with small portions of food; first soft food, like ice-cream or yogurt.,
Once you have mastered it with the soft foods, try chewing larger portions at a time, as you would normally eat.,
Move on to the more solid foods now, like fruits, rice, and bread.,
Once you are past this stage, try the hardest foods, such as granola bars and cereals.",How to Chew With Your Mouth Closed," Close your mouth and chew with your back teeth. Use one or two sticks of gum for this practice. Remember to breathe through your nose, not through your mouth.;
, Put a little bit of the food into your mouth. Now close your mouth, chewing with only your back teeth. Chew slowly; this helps you keep your mouth closed.

, This is no reason to open your mouth. Still chew with it closed.

, Follow the same principle: small portions at first, then slowly work your way up. Chew slowly.

, While these may make noise, it is no excuse to open your mouth while chewing.

Atmosphere/Ambiance - As you step into the restaurant, what is the feeling you get?,
Cleanliness - Does the restaurant appear clean?,
Service - Were the servers pleasant, communicative, efficient, knowledgeable?,
Food - Of course, this may arguably be the most important part of eating out.",How to Evaluate a Restaurant," Is it neat, comfortable, elegant, accommodating? Your first impression can be very telling about the restaurant. After all, if you plan to spend at least 20 minutes sitting somewhere eating, you should feel comfortable, right?;
, Do you find yourself wiping the seats and perhaps the table before you sit down? Do you find yourself even judging where to sit, and not because of the view?

, This makes for a very high percentage of the dining experience.

, But how does it look? How is it presented? How does it taste? And how much does it cost?

Make sure you have a napkin.,
Use a fork and a knife to separate a small area of the dish making it close to bite sized.

,
Once you have completed the last crucial step, cut it with your fork and knife one more time to ensure appropriate consumption size.

,
Bring your bite-sized piece to your mouth using your fork and/or spoon, choosing the appropriate utensil for the task.

,
Using your lips and/or tongue slowly and carefully pull the piece of food off of the utensil.

,
Chew the piece of food thoroughly decreasing the potential risk of choking with each scrumptious bite.

,
Carefully inspect your teeth with your tongue to insure that no food is stuck in between them.

Using your right hand, reach down to your lap to acquire your napkin.,
Put your napkin back in your lap, being especially careful not to get the food on your napkin onto your clothing.

Don’t point out the obvious.,
Take an etiquette class--together (or as a family).,
Practice proper table manners at home.,
Pick your battles.",How to Get Your Husband to Use Proper Table Manners," Barking orders at your spouse is only going to cultivate passive aggressive behavior. While he may be acting like an animal, telling him could be humiliating. Instead of whacking his elbows off the table or snapping his jaw closed when he chews, take a more subtle approach.


Ask him what kind of table manners were practiced at his house growing up. Perhaps he’s forgotten manners that his mother insisted upon and recalling them may bring them back today.
Point out bad manners on TV. See a TV or movie character exhibiting the same bad manners as your man? Point out how garish the character’s manners are--maybe it’ll ring a bell.
Talk about people behind their back. Well, perhaps talk about their manners. Discuss both good and bad mannered friends. For example, talk about how your friend Dan always looks put together, has sparkling dinner conversation and always knows which fork to use for each course. Quite the contrast, your friend Stephanie thinks that everything is a finger food and slurps her soda.;
, For fun, ask him to join you (and the kids) for a manners and etiquette class. Look for courses offered at your local community center or college. A good etiquette class will not only cover table manners but may also hit on themes such as how to write a proper thank you card and how to dress for certain occasions (topics that you may also want to cover). Not only can a class be beneficial to getting him to stop his bad habits, bringing the kids along will help them cultivate good manners that will lead them into the future.

, Lead by example and always practice proper table manners at home. Also, if you have children, insist they practice table manners. Use their errors as a way to point out “do’s” and “don’ts.” For example, if Mary is chewing with her mouth open while telling a story, stop her and say, “Mary, a lady or gentleman never shows his or her guests the food being chewed. Please chew with your mouth closed and then continue with your story.” Don’t forget to deliver praise, especially if its your husband practicing good manners. For example, “Look at how well daddy remembered to place his napkin in his lap!” Your husband will think you are just using him as a good example, while all along you are reinforcing good behavior.

, Your husband may never know which fork to use for the salad course or whether he can get away with serving white wine with beef; but as long as he can master the basics you should be able to dine in public with him and not want to hide.


Before a business dinner meeting, ask him if he wants to brush up on dining etiquette skills. In effort to impress the boss, he may be more willing to take gentle advice on what he should be doing differently at the table.
Focus on one aspect at a time. He may be a total disaster at the table, but instead of barking at him to take his elbows off the table, put his napkin in his lap and chew with his mouth closed, tackle it one bad manner at a time.
Don’t allow table manners to ruin your marriage. Sometimes the most stubborn of men may not adhere to change. If he either doesn’t understand what you want him to do or simply can’t remember don’t turn it into a federal case.

Bring cash or checks.,
Order your food.,
Prepare to be pranked.,
Hit the gift shop.",How to Enjoy a Visit to Lambert's Cafe," While many restaurants accept credit cards, this particular one does not. In addition, some menu items are on the expensive side, so make sure you have enough cash (or enough money in the bank - balance that checkbook!) to cover the meal and tip.;
, Lambert's offers a large selection of home-cooked food, with free refills on most entrées and drinks.The important thing to remember, however, is to save room in your stomach for pass-arounds and thrown rolls:


Sample some of the pass-arounds. The restaurant offers several foods that are carried from table-to-table, and anyone interested can take as much as they want. Traditional pass-arounds include:

Fried potatoes and onions
Macaroni and tomatoes
Black-eyed peas
Fried okra - Don't expect a plate! Grab a few of the paper towels provided at your table and the server will spoon the okra right on.
Sorghum molasses
Apple butter


Watch for the rolls! Every so often, a waiter (distinguished by the blue shirt, red suspenders, and bow tie) will wheel out a cart of freshly baked rolls. If you want one, stand up and wave your hands and the roll thrower will throw one to you. Be warned, they are hot and some do get dropped. If you drop yours, just jump back up and ask for another one. Then, smear some butter on it and eat it or wait for the pass-around apple butter to come around. Or get the sorghum (a thick molasses), offered by a server who comes after the one who throws the thrown rolls.

If you're not catching rolls but people close to you are, hold onto your drink to avoid accidents if the roll strays in your direction.



, This is just another part of the Lambert's experience... don't be surprised if a waiter threatens to dump iced tea over your head or squirt your shirt with ketchup. It's all part of the fun, and no harm will actually come to you or your property. Be a good sport, but don't let your guard down, and beware, they're huge supporters of the critter in the candy box trick... be wary if they offer you candy or gum, as something much creepier may jump out at you!

, Before you leave, purchase something to remind you of this eating experience, or even take some of the special foods home with you. The gift shop offers, among other things, 34 oz. insulated mugs like the ones you drank out of during the meal, Lambert's apple butter and sorghum molasses, jelly, honey, and the ever popular ""stress roll""."

To cut something,you stab your fork into it, but be careful and do this gently.,

When you are finished,put your fork and knife in the middle of the plate side by side and wait till the waiter collects it.This means that you are finished and are ready to be served the next course.

When chewing keep your mouth closed,and do not talk until you swallow every last bite.

Smile.,
Wait for the staff member to address you first.,
Be specific about your needs when you order.,
Avoid changing your order numerous times.,
If there is a problem with your order, do not hesitate to mention it, but be careful to be polite.,
When you leave, it's not necessary to bus your own table, but it is a nice gesture that will not go unnoticed.,
The following steps are specifically for Drive-thru coffee shops:

Roll down your window as you approach the menu board.",How to Get Better Service at a Coffee Shop," By being polite and friendly you can virtually guarantee that your transaction will go smoothly. People respond to kindness, and if you say ""please"" and ""thank you"" it will go a long way.;
, Even if they don't appear to be occupied with anything important, they may be busy helping another customer (especially if the cafe has a drive-thru)or with catering or checking that everything is ready to serve you (e.g., coffee is fresh, everything is stocked sufficiently). If you are patient, it will be recognized and appreciated. However, if staff is overtly ignoring you or has not noticed you, a polite ""excuse me"" is appropriate.

, If you want to take a moment to look at the menu, say so. If you are wondering what a certain drink is, ask. If you are stumped as to what to get, ask for a recommendation. If you are clear about what you want it will be easier for the person serving you to help you, and you will be more satisfied with the end result.

, Changing your mind is your prerogative, and it is perfectly fine if you forgot to specify skim milk, or decided at the last minute to get something to eat or to pick up something for a friend. Just try to stay within reason and make minor adjustments, for the sake of your server as well as the other customers.

, Do not interrupt your server just to complain; wait until they are finished with the next customer or speak with someone who is free. Do not whine (""this always happens when I come here"") and do not make accusations (""you made me the wrong drink""). Simply state what the problem is, and you will likely be given a replacement or be reimbursed with no fuss.

, Just be sure to respond if a staff member says ""good-bye"" or ""have a nice day"". If you leave a good impression, it will probably carry over to your next visit.

, Drive-thru staff are trained to greet you as soon as your vehicle is detected by a sensor, and if your window is rolled up you might not hear them. This can be confusing, especially if they request that you give them a moment before you place your order.
Turn off the radio, pause the conversation,make the dog stop barking and,if necessary,(particularly for trucks and SUVs) turn off the engine in order to be understood more easily. The driver should be the one to place the order, being closest to the microphone.
If you need time to look over the menu board, do not simply ignore the server's greeting. Tell him/her that you need a moment to decide. Then decide as quickly as possible so that other customers are not kept waiting.
Keep in mind that drive-thru service was created to be fast and convenient. This means that large orders, ground coffee/coffee beans and merchandise purchases should not be made in drive-thru. You will be served faster in these cases if you walk into the cafe.
Pay with cash, or with gift cards. Credit cards and debit take longer and do not always work consistently. If possible, pay with exact change.
Do not add to your order once you get to the window, especially if there are several cars behind you.

",How to Enjoy a Visit to a Frozen Yogurt Shop," Frozen yogurt that you get at a frozen yogurt shop isn't the frozen yogurt you get when you freeze Yogurt. It's usually tarter, sweeter, and thicker.;

Most people who have had luck getting into the show's studio audience simply knew “the right person.” As such, if you know someone connected to the show or connected to Fox Broadcasting, make use of that acquaintanceship.


Make your request directly to the person you know rather than going through official channels.
The more influence your contact has within the company or with the show, the more likely you are to succeed in your appeal.;
, While the official Hell's Kitchen e-mail address is provided online for casting inquiries, you can also use it to inquire about ticket reservations.


Send an e-mail to: hellskitchen@theconlincompany.com
Within the body of the message, express your interest in reserving tickets. Provide your full name, the number of tickets you would like to request, your phone number, and your mailing address.
Also ask for additional information regarding ticket requests. You might be instructed to pass your request onto another source.

, Write a quick letter expressing your interest in tickets to Hell's Kitchen. State how many tickets you would like to request, along with your name and address. You should also include a stamped, self-addressed envelope that the show's directors can use to send you your tickets.


When applying postage to the self-addressed return envelope, use ""Forever"" stamps instead of relying on other stamps or postage paid without the ""Forever"" seal. Postage rates could go up by the time an opening appears on the show.
You may also want to include your phone number. If a last minute opening arises, you may receive a phone number asking about your availability.
The address to use when writing your ticket request is:

FOX BROADCASTING Publicity Dept.
P.O. Box 900
Beverly Hills, CA 90213-0900



, Tickets can only be obtained through Fox Broadcasting or by a direct invitation from someone connected to the show. Many second party websites claim that they can obtain tickets to Hell's Kitchen and other reality TV shows, but more often than not, these websites are scams.


As hard as it might be to believe, real tickets to the show should cost you nothing. If a second party website wants your credit card information or other financial data, that website should not be trusted.

, The show's official website once had a ""Reservations"" section on its front page, located near the bottom of the screen. As the show rose in popularity, a backlog of reservation requests developed, and producers removed that section from the website. Nonetheless, you should continue to check the webpage for updates on whether or not reservations are actively being requested.


You can always send in a request through one of the other methods described here, even if reservations are not being accepted on the website.
The website can be found at: http://www.fox.com/hells-kitchen/


, Chances are, reservations for the next season or two of Hell's Kitchen are already booked up. If you are patient enough to wait several seasons, though, you might be lucky enough to get a spot sometime in the future.


Additionally, there is some chance that a guest will cancel, creating an unexpected opening as a result. When this happens, producers turn to their back-up list of reservation requests. Your name could be selected as a last minute fill-in, especially if you live in the Los Angeles area, around the location of the show's filming.

, Hell's Kitchen is not an actual restaurant. The kitchen and dining room are on a soundstage, so your dining experience will not be anything like what you might expect at a real eating establishment.Even after you obtain tickets, there is no guarantee that you will actually be able to eat anything there, and you will be asked to sign a form signifying your understanding of that.
Service will be slow, even if you do eat. Expect the visit to take at least three hours. As you wait, however, you will be given free alcohol and bread.
Most people who have visited the set of the show report that the food is decent, but not fantastic. If you still want to go, do so for the entertainment experience and not for the sake of a great meal.

Pick the restaurant.,
Decide how many people are in your party.,
Set a date and time.",How to Book Restaurant Reservations1," Before you make reservations it’s best to decide on what restaurant you’d like to go to. Not every restaurant is willing to take reservations, even if they are consistently busy. For example, some smaller or newer restaurants may not have enough clientele yet to set up a system for reservations. So it’s important to know a restaurant’s policy before you try to book a table.;
, Once you’ve chosen a restaurant, figure out how many people are going to go to dinner with you. Depending on the size of your party, your wait time may vary. For example, if there are only two of you, you are more likely to have an easier time getting a table. On the other hand, if you are trying to book a table for a party of 10, it’s going to be much more difficult. The number of people in your party may also affect how far ahead you need to book your reservation.If you are unsure whether or not a person will be able to make it, book a table including them anyways. It’s easier to have an empty seat rather than trying to add a chair to a table in a crowded restaurant.

, Depending on the day of the week, there may be more openings than others. For example, reserving a table on a weekday is easier than trying to book a table over the weekend. Similarly, setting a reservation for “off-hours” rather than the regular “prime time” hours for breakfast, lunch, or dinner will make getting a reservation easier.


You should always have a backup date and time in case there is no availability at the original time you chose.

"
"
Call as far ahead of time as possible.,
Be as courteous as possible when booking a reservation.,
Call to confirm your reservation.,
Call ahead or cancel if you are running late.,
Try to arrive 10-15 minutes before your reservation time.",How to Book Restaurant Reservations2," In many cases, you will be able to make a dinner reservation early in the same day. However, if you are planning the dinner ahead of time, call earlier. Most restaurants will accept reservations a few days in advance, and exclusive fine dining venues will often accept (or even require) reservations weeks or months in advance.

, If you are attempting to book a tough reservation, remember that your attitude on the phone will go a long way. Be confident but polite; avoid giving the impression that you feel entitled to a reservation. However, remember that even Michelin-starred restaurants are not in the business of turning away customers. If the host replies that the restaurant has no availability, explain your situation and ask politely if there is any way you can be accommodated in the future.


When calling say, ""Hi, I'd like to place a reservation for this coming Saturday at 5."" The host will then likely ask how many people are in your party and tell you if that time and date is available. If it's not available, try asking ""Is there a table available for an earlier/later time?"" If the answer is still no, ask if they can give you their earliest availability and go from there.

, If you book your table a week or more in advance, it's sometimes good to call the day of your reservation just to double-check that you still have it. You should do this as early in the day as you can in case there is a problem. This will allow you to make other plans if you need to, or give you time to work out the problem with the restaurant.

, Once you've secured your reservation, call ahead and apologize if it looks like you'll be up to 20 minutes late. If you are running much later than that, consider canceling and rescheduling your dinner. Remember that reservations are made for a reason - to make sure as many guests as possible are served on each night. If you are late it affects other guests' reservations.

, This way you can let the hostess know you've arrived and ensure that your table won't be given to someone else. Many restaurants will have a bar or waiting area that you can sit in and get drinks. However, remember to re-approach the hostess when the time for your reservation comes up so you aren't passed over.

"
"
Try the restaurant’s website.,
Use an online booking site or mobile application.,
Check your email and phone regularly.",How to Book Restaurant Reservations3," Many restaurants allow you to book a reservation directly on their website. When doing this, you may also be able to see a list of all available dates and times for either the upcoming week or month. The restaurant is likely to require you to create a login or provide an email address or phone number so they can confirm your reservations. However, they should not text or email you anything else outside of updates on your reservation.

, If you are unable to book a reservation directly on the restaurant’s website, you can try an online booking site like OpenTable or Reservation Genie. These sites will allow you to search restaurants based on your preference of time, date, cuisine, and price range. There are also applications you can put on your phone like NoWait, which allows you to put your name in before heading to the restaurant. An app like this is great for last minute reservations., Once you’ve made your reservations online, you should receive a confirmation either by email or via text. Some of these sites or restaurants may require you to click a link or a button to confirm your reservation. You may also be sent a link to cancel or change your reservation if you need to.


Many of these online booking sites also offer coupons or have membership rewards programs through which you can accumulate perks.
If you can’t cancel online, you may have to call the restaurant directly.

Place your chopsticks on the table in front of you with their tips pointing to the left if you need to set them down during or after your meal.

,


Use chopsticks with your free hand to eat rice from the rice bowl, or use your free hand to hold a soup bowl as you drink directly from the bowl.

, This can be done by exerting pressure on the chopsticks to tear the food apart.


Take small bites from large pieces of food that you are unable to separate.

, Sushi is often specifically prepared and decorated in a manner that is intended to be eaten in one bite.

, The Japanese culture considers it good table manners to eat every item on your plate, including every grain of rice.

, When alcohol is served, everyone at the table must serve each other instead of pouring their own drinks.


Observe the amount of alcohol in everyone's drinking glasses throughout the meal and refill drinks as needed.

You can get a quick taste of the restaurant’s personality and faire this way. If you have the time, you may find it useful to look at a restaurant’s website for a menu and prices. Be sure to ask a friend or your favorite bartender; word of mouth is the strongest praise available and a good place to start.;
, Companies like Yelp, Google Reviews, and Trip Advisor offer a great resource to those who are trying to find the best restaurant. There are a number of signs to look out for on these websites on order to determine the quality of restaurant.Look out for the number of stars on the review. Any restaurant worth its salt will have at least three and a half stars, but ideally you should look out for four or above.
Read a sample of reviews to see what the pros and cons of a restaurant. Reviews offer a great way to see what the best dishes as photos are often included with the reviews.
Be sure to check the dates of the reviews. Some restaurants have changes in management so the content of the reviews may change depending on the date.

, For example, if you are a vegetarian, have nut allergies, or have celiac's disease it's crucial to carefully read over the menu to see if there will be an adequate number of options. Also consider calling the restaurant to see if they have any dietary substitutions that aren't listed on the menu.

, While few restaurants will outright refuse you for being underdressed, it's still important to dress the part if you're eating at an upscale establishment. Check out the restaurant's website to see what kind of dress code to expect.


Jacket required. This is generally the highest dress code restaurants will require. This means the man is expected to wear a formal jacket such as a sports coat or blazer, while a woman should wear the equivalent such as a gowns, dresses, or even pantsuits.
Formal attire. For restaurants requiring formal attire, this dress code can be slightly more varied than a jacket required code. Women could wear cocktail dresses or more comfortable long dresses. Men should still wear something like a sport coat, but nice slacks and a tucked in button-down shirt would generally be acceptable.
Formal-casual. Many restaurants will specify something in-between the fanciest and the most low-key establishments. Examples of formal-casual or casual elegant could be turtlenecks, nice sweaters, a simple black dress, button-down shirt with a light sports coat, darker colors, leather shoes, or jewelry.
Casual. While casual is the most relaxed requirement for dress code, it doesn't mean you should wear sweaty, ripped clothing. Something as simple as a fresh t-shirt and a clean pair of jeans with sneakers is acceptable. Remember to keep up basic hygiene too. Casual doesn't mean you can spread body odor through the restaurant. , When you have decided on a place, make a reservation—even if it is only 15 minutes before when you would like to eat. This is a common courtesy and gives the host or employee answering the phone an opportunity to share any pertinent information about the night. Oftentimes, the restaurant will relay if there is a set special, fixed menu, or charitable event for the evening. The host also may suggest a preferred time to come, letting you know when you will get the most care and attentive service. Now would also be an opportune time to inform the restaurant and kitchen of any important dietary restrictions or serious allergies.

, Just as in the case of a doctor’s visit or a job interview, arrive a few minutes early. This simple bit of pre-planning allows the restaurant to run a smooth schedule so other patrons aren't kept waiting longer. If you are running considerably late, be sure to inform the restaurant.

, Restaurants located in busy downtown centers may have a lack of parking so you need to consider whether it's necessary to bring extra money for parking decks or valets. Consider taking public transportation or calling a taxi if the parking situation looks especially dire so you don't spend more time circling for a space then you do eating your food.

, if your table isn’t ready or they look particularly busy. A bit of empathy and a small nonchalant gesture of good will can go a long way toward assuaging a flustered restaurant worker who is momentary overwhelmed. With any luck, you may even be given a complimentary drink or small offering from the kitchen as thanks.

, If your server immediately asks you for your drinks and you're not sure, consider asking for a water while you look over the drink menu. It's important not to get flustered and order something you're not completely satisfied with just because your server rushed to the table.

, Many restaurants will have rotating specials that can offer tasty surprises. Ask about the vegetable, fish, or soup of the day as well to make sure you're not missing out on the freshest ingredients or rare entrees.

, Usually, by the time that the server brings your beverages, you can begin to order appetizer. This is where looking at the restaurant’s menu online prior to arriving has its advantages—especially if you are pressed for time.


Be as specific as possible with your order. Make sure you've notified your server of any allergies you have, you would like the meat cooked, and any special changes from the way the item is listed. Check to see if substitutions are allowed. Some establishments take great pride in their menu options and don't allow any changes made to the entrees. Respect this mandate if substitutions aren't acceptable.
If you're done ordering food, be sure to gather your menus and hand them to the server at the end of your order. , Servers have a detailed knowledge of the best options so it's always a good idea to pick their brain for ideas. Don't be afraid to take their suggestions if it's a dish that's foreign to you.

, One of the quickest to get on your servers bad side is to order the chicken and the switch to the steak after the cooks have already started. Take your time to make sure you're happy with the dish in order to make the restaurant run as smoothly as possible. , Timing is a key factor in a good dining experience, and, in order to hedge your bets, it is helpful to place orders at times when the server can give your request their full attention. Make an effort to speak clearly and be decisive.

, Shared plates are an increasingly common phenomenon, and it can be easy to make a culinary faux pas when a number of mouth-watering dishes hit the table, but remember to use the appropriate utensil and eat from your plate and not the serving platter. Naturally, the level of decorum and scrutiny to it depend on the kind of restaurant and your company. Nobody expects you to eat barbecue spareribs with a knife and fork., Certain restaurants will offer a variety of utensils that can seem intimidating if you're not familiar with their uses. Take care to think about the different sizes of spoons, as well as alternative utensils such as chopsticks.


Small stirring spoons are often used for coffee and teas. Obviously, these spoons should only be used for your drink.
Soup spoons are deeper and more rounded. They are specifically shaped to ease the process of consuming your soup and are not recommended for other uses.
A place spoon is about 7 inches long and is an all-purpose spoon. This is the most common spoon used at restaurants and can be used for entrees, soups, and desserts alike.
Salad spoons have an elongated shape that are formulated to make salads easier to serve. They can occasionally be chilled as well. , Be sure to address any problems about the food with your server; a patron may want something sent back to the kitchen to be made again with or without an ingredient. By being straightforward and open about what you would like, the restaurant staff can attempt to correct the problem quickly and efficiently. If a serious error has been or a dead bug ended up in your entree, don't be afraid to ask for a free appetizer in order to compensate for unsanitary dining experience.

, If you enjoyed your food, be sure to send your thanks to the back-of-house staff as well. In some places, you can specifically tip them, and in most others, you can buy them a round of drinks that they can have after their shift.

, Make sure everyone is clear who is paying for what so you're not in an awkward situation where someone doesn't have enough money to pay for their food. This is also crucial so you can easily explain to your server how you want the check divided when it comes time for payment.

, Your server may bring the bill without being asked, or they may wait for you to initiate it so that they do need seem like they are rushing you out of the restaurant. If you have the time, try one of life’s small luxuries and order an after-dinner coffee, espresso, or digestif while waiting for the bill to arrive.

, The end of a meal—especially one between a number of separately paying parties—can be a hectic time, and a mistake may have been made. Ensure that you are paying the correct amount.

, The server will bring back any change if necessary. Remember that in the United States, a tip for the server is expected to be about 20% of the total bill. If they have given you excellent service above and beyond what was expected of them, you can give them more."

Use a minimal amount of soy sauce on all food.,
Use small amounts of wasabi to flavor your food.",How to Eat Authentic Japanese Cuisine2," An excessive amount of soy sauce can overpower the taste of Japanese cuisine and can be considered bad table manners if you waste soy sauce by using more than you end up eating.


Pour soy sauce into a small serving dish provided with your meal, then dip small pieces of food or small amounts of rice into the sauce for flavoring.

, Wasabi can largely overpower the flavor of most dishes if used in excess, and can also offend sushi chefs if added liberally to a piece of sushi after it has already been prepared.


Request that your sushi be made without wasabi if you do not like its taste. This will prevent the sushi chef from being offended if you do not eat the sushi.

Go for the ""All You Can Eat Salad Bar"".,
Check out the petite steaks.,
Choose vegetables for side dishes or for french fry substitutions.,
See if you can split a dish with another person.",How to Eat Healthy at Sizzler," There are a lot of healthy options in the huge variety that they offer, if you choose wisely.


Salads: Go for the spinach leaves, cabbage, or romaine lettuce. Pile on the raw vegetables, such as mushrooms, cucumbers, and tomatoes. Choose a light dressing, such as Italian. Note that the Blue Cheese and Ranch has the most calories and fat. If you want more toppings, go towards the sliced hard boiled eggs instead of the shredded cheese.
Fruit bar: Fresh fruit, such as watermelon, melons, pineapple, and kiwi are available in slices, while you might find whole fruit, such as apples and bananas.
Stay away from the salad bar entrees. The chicken, spaghetti, and taco bar might look appealing, but also very much loaded with unnecessary fat and calories.
Have some potato or macaroni salad as a side dish, along with the soft serve ice cream available. Always double check with the server if the dessert(s) are low-fat.;
, It might be a ""your eyes are bigger than your stomach"" issue when it comes to the sizes of the steaks on the menu. Petite 6 oz steaks are available on the lunch and dinner menu.

, Ask your server if you can do a substitution and get a baked potato or broccoli instead. Avoid any extra baked potato additions that your server might ask you on.

, Sizzler has great combination dishes, such as steak & lobster and steak & grilled shrimp. Just remember that if a person has the salad bar as their meal or even as an additional dish to their ""main course"" meal, then nothing can be shared amongst others.

Be polite.,
Be helpful when the server asks for your drink.,
Try to discern what is in your meal choice prior to asking questions.,
When you receive your meal the server will wait about 30 seconds for you to check it over and make sure it's ok or if you need anything else.,
Be gracious when the server checks in on you.,
Move all bowls, plates, cups, and glasses no longer in use to the end of the table so the server can remove them easily.,
Although you probably don't want anything after the meal, don't wait if you do because the bill is likely in the process of being tallied up if you dally.,
Pay your bill promptly.,
Tip correctly.",How to Behave Considerately at a Restaurant," When you are seated at a table and your server comes to greet you, stop talking, get off the phone and respond. Think about how it feels for those waiting on you when you make them wait for a long time; you wouldn't do this to people at your work, so try not to do it in a restaurant.;
, Make it very clear what it is that you would like and if you need any changes, spell these out very clearly rather than hoping your server will read your mind. Be considerate if your server asks you if want something before the meal; this is often standard practice. Just say no if it doesn't interest you.

, That way, you can avoid asking more obvious questions and just ask the questions that are specific to your concerns, such as any need for dietary changes or allergen avoidance.

, Tell the waiter there and then if something concerns you, or if something is missing; that is what this opportunity is for.

, The server should come back more than one time to see how your are doing, don't ignore them or be rude - a simple nod will do unless there is a problem.

, If you need a fresh plate or glass for anything, just ask for one.

, The server will ask you if you want anything, and this is your opportunity to ask for dessert, extra drinks etc.

, When it comes to credit cards or debit, remember they are the same payment method as far as the server is concerned. Don't ask the server to add the tip - that is your job and you should write this in clearly. With cash, an experienced server can tell if you need change or not if you are using a 50 on a 25 dollar meal. But if a server says ""I will be right back with your change"" but you don't want any, say so right there and then to save them having to make a return trip for naught, especially on a busy night.

, If you are happy with the service you've received, be considerate and leave your waiter or waitress a tip. 10% of the cost of your bill, plus another 5% is usually considered acceptable for decent service. If you think that your server was exceptional, you may want to leave a little more. Leaving a tip is only common courtesy, because the servers at most restaurants really don't get paid very much by their employers.

"
"
Understand that courtesy is making sure everyone around you feels comfortable.,
Mind your manners.,
When you get to the restaurant, take your seat and wait for the staff to take your order.,

Remember what your mother taught you when the food arrives.,
When settling the bill, do so in a timely manner, and do not forget to tip.",How to Be Polite at a Restaurant," Keep this in mind. Do not try to do weird or extreme things that may make other people uncomfortable. Instead, smile and try to be nice.;
, Use your pleases and thank-yous. These will be appreciated by the staff at the restaurants and may get you better service.

, Do not run around the restaurant like a little animal! This will disturb the other diners and is not polite.

, This will help save time for them, which they will appreciate. If you have questions about the menu, don't be afraid to ask them. Just be sure to do so while maintaining your manners.

, Keep your mouth closed when you chew, don't put your elbows on the table, and don't slurp! Also, try not to burp loudly, 'cause in most places this is considered very rude.

, Most service folks rely primarily on tips, so be sure to be fair. When it comes to the bill though, do not squabble loudly over it, or disagree with the waiter in an overly vocal manner. If there is an issue, just ask to talk to the manager.

",How to Make Horchata1," Authentic recipes call for white, long grain rice. It is possible to make horchata with different kinds of rice; just know that you will get a different flavor with different varieties of rice.


Indian Basmati rice is a white, long grain rice. Your horchata will have a more ""rice-like"" flavor, so you may want to add a little extra cinnamon to counter this effect.Long grain brown rice will have a nutty flavor. It will not taste like authentic horchata, but it could be a tasty spin on this classic beverage.If you can find Mexican cinnamon (Canela), this will lend a more authentic flavor to your horchata. Canela is slightly milder than American cinnamon.;
, You can use a blender, coffee bean or grain mill to grind the rice. Try to get the rice to the consistency of a coarse polenta.This will allow the rice to better absorb the water and cinnamon.You can try to blend the rice with a food processor, but the rice may just whirl around and not actually break up.You can also grind the rice by hand using a metate, or corn grinding stone.If you can't get the rice that fine, just break it up as much as possible., Cover the mixture and allow it to come to room temperature., The more time you allow the mixture to soak, the more flavorful it will be. If you have the time, it is highly recommended you give it a day to soak.Don't refrigerate the mix. Let it sit out at room temperature., If you do not have a blender or food processor, you will need to soak the rice in water for two days, or until the water becomes milky. The horchata may be grittier with this method, so be sure you strain it well and mix it up before drinking.If you have a hand-held or burr mixer, you can mix the horchata right in the bowl.

, This may take between 1 and 4 minutes, depending on your blender. Try to get the mixture as smooth as you possibly can., Pour just a little at a time, and use a spoon or spatula to stir the mixture as it goes through. If you have trouble straining the mixture because of a build up of rice gunk in the strainer, you can discard this as you go.Gather the cheesecloth at the top and twist to squeeze out any remaining liquid., You can substitute different sweeteners, like simple syrup, honey, or agave.

Get kefir seeds.,
Buy a jar to use for kefir.,
Pick out a kefir base.",How to Make Kefir1," Kefir seeds are available online or in health food stores. Kefir seeds reproduce on their own, so one starter batch can last years and years. You can also divide clumps of kefir seeds and give some to friends. Like sourdough, the kefir will simply reproduce, so you'll never run out.Kefir seeds can be either frozen or dried if you want to store them.
If you expose the kefir seeds to a chemical or extreme temperatures, they can die.;
, If you get into the daily habit of making kefir, it's worth picking out a jar that's just the right size for your needs. For an average amount of kefir, use a quart-sized mason jar. Kefir needs a breathable lid, which you can create using a coffee filter and a mason jar lid ring.


Don't use a plastic container, since the molecules can leach into the kefir.
If you wish, sterilize the jar before using it by boiling it for five minutes, then draining it on a clear paper towel.

, Kefir is usually made with whole milk. Using full-fat milk gives the kefir a tangy flavor and a yogurt-like texture, making it great to drink by itself or use in smoothies and recipes. For an even thicker kefir, add some cream. If you'd prefer not to drink cow milk, try these alternatives:


Water. You can make a fermented water-based drink with kefir to get its nutritional benefits. Make sure you use purified water, though - tap water contains chemicals that can kill kefir.
Goat's milk. The human body is able to digest goat's milk more easily than cow's milk, so this is a good alternative if you're lactose intolerant.
Coconut milk. Kefir-fermented coconut milk makes a great base for fruity, healthy drinks. Use the purest coconut milk you can find, with no additives or sugars. If possible, make your own coconut milk to use. Grains won't reproduce in coconut milk, so you will have to return them to a dairy base when you're finished making this type of kefir.

Add ice cream to blender.,
Add milk to the blender.,
Smash your candy.,
Blend the ingredients.,
Determine the right texture.,
Add some final touches.",How to Make Homemade ShakeAways," Scoop out about 3-4 scoops of ice cream from the carton, and add them to the blender.


The more ice cream you add, the bigger your shake will be.
Vanilla ice cream is usually used as a base to add candy flavors to, but any type of ice cream flavor works just fine.;
, Measure out 1/3 of a cup of milk and add it to the blender.Depending on how think you want you shake, you can add more milk to make your shake thinner (1/2 cup of milk), or less milk to make it thicker (1/4 cup of milk).

, Measure out how much candy you want to add to your ShakeAway, and pour it into a plastic bag, bowl, or mortar. If you add your candy to a bag, you can smash the candy with a hammer or rolling pin. If you add your candy to a bowl, you can smash the candy using a pestle, or smash in the candy in the mortar using the pestle. Once all your candy is smashed, add it to the blender.


It doesn't matter what kind of bag you use, but the main point is that you want your candy to be confined somewhere where you can smash it collectively and keep the candy together.
The more translucent the bag material is, the better you can see portions of the candy that are already smashed, or still need to be smashed.
Be sure to keep a lookout for holes in the bag created by smashing the candy.
Smashing the candy helps with blending the candy into the ShakeAway, and also helps reduce damage to the blender’s blades.

, Blend the ice cream, milk, and candy until the mixture becomes smooth and pourable. Depending on the size of your candy pieces, you might have to try a higher blender setting if your candy pieces are bigger. If your candy pieces are relatively small, the normal blending settings should work just fine.


Be sure to put on the top of the blender, so you don't splash milk and ice cream everywhere.

, The texture of your ShakeAway is all about your personal preference. Normally, ShakeAways have a consistency where the candy pieces are small enough to fit through a straw, and the ice cream, milk, and candy can be eaten with a spoon, but still thin enough to immediately spill if knocked over.


A general rule of thumb is, blend the mixture less to have a thicker ShakeAway, or blend it more to have a thinner, smoother ShakeAway.

, To top off your ShakeAway, consider adding a dollop or two of whipped cream and/or sprinkle some of your whole pieces of candy or leftover bits for a crunchy topping."

Put 2 tablespoons of kefir grains into a clean glass jar.,
Pour 2 1/2 cups of milk into the jar.,
Cover the jar and store it at room temperature.,
Let it ferment for 8 hours.,
Strain the kefir.,
Rinse the seeds and start again.",How to Make Kefir2," This is a good amount of kefir grains to start with, as it will produce a nice average kefir flavor. As you get into the practice of making kefir, experiment with adding more seeds or fewer seeds. You'll see the the amount of seeds you use really affects the flavor, and it's all a matter of personal preference.

, Again, the amount of milk you use in relation to the kefir is a matter of preference, but 2 1/2 cups is a good place to start. Don't fill the far all the way to the top, since the mixture needs room to breathe during the fermentation process; you should keep it about 2/3 full.

, Designate a spot on the counter or in your cabinet to store the kefir. If you put it in the refrigerator the fermentation process won't take place.

, The fermentation process takes several hours, so the easiest thing to do is prepare the kefir seeds and milk at night and use it in the morning. The longer you let the seeds do their work, the more tangy the kefir will taste and the thicker it will get.


If you prefer less flavorful kefir, you can use it after 5 hours or so instead of waiting all night.
Coconut kefir takes longer to ferment. You may have to let it sit for longer than 8 hours.

, Place a piece of cheesecloth or a fine-mesh strainer over a second jar or a bowl. Pour the kefir from the original jar through the cheesecloth, separating the kefir seeds from the liquid. The kefir is now ready to drink or store in the refrigerator.

, Rinse the seeds in distilled water (never tap water). Place them in a clean jar, fill it with milk, and start the process over. If you're not yet ready for a second batch of kefir, you can rest the kefir by placing the seeds in a jar, adding milk, and letting it sit for a week before straining.

Use dairy kefir in place of milk.,
Eat coconut kefir as a refreshing treat.,
Drink water kefir to hydrate during the day.",How to Make Kefir3," Any time you'd normally use milk or yogurt for a meal or in your cooking, substitute kefir. Kefir makes an excellent base for sauces, and it can even be used in baking as a healthier dairy substitute. Consider these options:


Eat kefir with granola for breakfast.
Stir kefir into your coffee.
Make a yogurt grapefruit cake with kefir instead of yogurt.

, Coconut kefir can't always be used as a direct substitute for milk in recipes, but it has a variety of other wonderful uses, and is especially delicious when enjoyed plain. Try these ideas:


Make a coconut kefir smoothie by blending a cup of kefir, a banana, and a handful of berries.
Use coconut kefir as the base for a homemade pina colada.
Stir coconut kefir into soups and sauces to make them thick, rich and creamy.

, Water kefir is much lighter than other types of kefir, so you might find yourself drinking it all day long. Use it whenever you'd normally use water in recipes for soup. You can also flavor water kefir with fruit juice, mint, or other flavorings to make a tasty drink.

Store your jars of tomato juice in a cool, dry place.",How to Make Tomato Juice," The best tomatoes to use for making juice are ripe heirloom tomatoes that taste delicious raw. If a slice of the tomato has great flavor and texture, the juice will come out tasting great, too. Look for tomatoes at the peak of tomato season at your local produce market or farmer's market. Keep in mind that you should be looking for juicy, sandwich or salad tomatoes, rather than paste tomatoes.


Organic tomatoes are better to use than commercially-grown tomatoes that use pesticides. You don't want to be able to taste chemicals in your juice.
You can choose one variety or a combination.Early Girl and Big Boy varieties produce more juice, while Roma tomatoes produce thicker juice (if using Roma tomatoes (paste tomatoes), you may want to combine them with some other, juicier tomato varieties).;
, Rinse the tomatoes under running tap water and dry with a clean dish towel or paper towels. Simply rinsing the tomatoes should be enough to remove most dirt and bacteria.

, Slice the tomatoes open by cutting each one in half. Dig out the stem, removing any hard part that is not part of the flesh, and cut each half into two equal halves.

, Use a stainless steel or porcelain pot rather than an aluminum one; aluminum will likely react with the acid in the tomatoes causing discoloring and possibly an off flavor., Use a potato masher or a wooden spoon to press the tomatoes, releasing some of the juice. The pot should now be full of a mixture of tomato juice and other tomato parts. You want enough liquid in the pot to bring to a boil.


If the mixture seems too dry to boil, add a few cups of water until you have enough liquid in the pot to boil.

, Stir the tomatoes and tomato juice constantly, so the mixture doesn't burn. Keep cooking until the mixture is soft and soupy. This process should take about 25 to 30 minutes.

, Add a pinch of sugar, salt or other seasonings to flavor your tomato juice. The sweetness of the sugar helps cut back the acidity of the tomatoes.


If you feel unsure about how much sugar, salt, or pepper to use, it is best to start with too little. You can do a taste test before you remove the tomatoes from the heat and add more seasoning, as necessary.

, You do not want them to return to room temperature, but they should be cool enough to reduce the risk of accidental burns.

, Place a sieve or wire mesh strainer over a large glass bowl. If using a strainer, select one with small gaps. Use a glass or plastic bowl, since metal bowls may react with the acid in the tomatoes. Gradually pour the cooled tomato mash through the sieve. Most of the tomato juice should flow through the holes.


Shake the sieve occasionally to unclog the holes and allow more juice to drip into the bowl. Use a rubber spatula to squeeze the tomato mash against the bottom of the sieve. Pressing down on the mash will help squeeze out any juice that is still trapped inside the tomatoes.
Discard the solids left behind inside the sieve. These solids will not have much, if any, culinary value.

, Store it for at least 30 minutes before serving. Stir the juice well before drinking. Your tomato juice can last up to one week when kept refrigerated in a tightly-sealed container.

, Use a tomato paste that contains as few additional ingredients as possible. You can also use a 12-ounce (360 milliliter) can of tomato paste to create more juice, but you will also need to double the amount of water you use.

, Select a pitcher with a lid and sealable spout to preserve the juice as long as possible. If using a 12-ounce (360 milliliter) can of paste, use a large pitcher.

, Pour the water into the pitcher with the tomato paste. You can also measure out water using conventional measuring cups, but measuring it with the can will maintain the proportions well enough.

, If possible, use a hand-held blender to make sure that both ingredients are thoroughly combined.

, Stir the ingredients or blend with a hand-held blender until combined. If the tomato paste already included salt, omit it here.

, Dispose of any unused juice after a week.

, To can tomato juice, you'll need quart-size (approximately 1 liter) mason jars with rings and new lids as well as a canner so you can create a sterile seal. It may also be helpful to get a jar lifter to make it easier to remove the hot jars from the canner when you're finished heating them.


Note that it is not recommended to can tomato juice without using a canner. The tomato juice must be heated to a high temperature in order to kill bacteria and ensure the juice will be safe to drink when you open the jars.Either a boiling water canner, a dial-gauge pressure canner, or a weighted-gauge pressure canner will work.

, You may either boil the jars for 5 minutes a piece, or sterilize them by running them through the dishwasher. Set them out on a clean dishcloth to prepare them for filling.

, If you're going to the trouble of canning juice, it's better to make fresh juice than to can juice you made using tomato paste. Make enough juice to fill up one or more quart jars, keeping in mind that you'll need to leave 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of headspace at the top of each jar.

,, Boiling the juice for 10 minutes kills bacteria in preparation for canning. At this time, you may take one of the following optional measures to further preserve the juice:


Add lemon juice or vinegar. The acidity of lemon juice and vinegar helps preserve the tomato juice. Add one teaspoon per jar.Salt. Salt acts as a preservative as well, and if you wish to use it, add one teaspoon for each quart. Keep in mind that salt will alter the flavor of the juice.

, Leave 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of headspace at the top of each jar. Place the lids on the jars and tighten the rings.

, Follow the operating instructions for your particular type of canner. The standard heating time is between 25 and 35 minutes. When the process is complete, remove the jars and allow them to cool, undisturbed, for 24 hours.,"

Measure your milk.,
Pour the milk into a wide, heavy-bottomed saucepan.,
Bring to a simmer, whisking frequently.,
Simmer at low heat.,
Whisk and scrape the pan frequently.,
Stop once the milk is less than half its original volume.,
Strain out the solids.,
Refrigerate the milk.",How to Make Evaporated Milk1," You can turn regular milk into evaporated milk by removing about 60% of the water. This means 30 ounces (3¾ cups / 890 mL) of regular milk will make 12 ounces (1½ cups / 350 mL) evaporated milk, the amount typically found in one can.You can use full fat, reduced fat, or skim milk.
Non-homogenized milk (including raw milk) will separate into fat and liquid as you heat it. This makes it a poor choice for making evaporated milk unless you add an emulsifier, such as lecithin.;
, The wider the pot, the faster the water will evaporate. A thick, nonstick base helps minimize burning from milk solids that sink to the bottom.

, Place the saucepan over medium heat. Keep a close eye on the milk and whisk frequently to prevent a skin from forming. If a skin does form, remove it or break it apart, or it will block water from evaporating., Reduce heat to keep the milk at a very low simmer. Depending on the pot size, stove temperature, and amount of milk, it can take anywhere from another twenty minutes to a couple hours to finish making evaporated milk.


Alternatively, bring the milk to a low boil and stir constantly for ten minutes. This requires a deep pot to prevent boiling over, and comes with a high risk of a ""scorched"" taste.If you dislike a light brown color or caramel flavors, you can heat the milk below simmering, at around 160ºF (70ºC). It may take several hours to boil down, but the result will have a pure milk color and flavor., It's normal for small amounts of milk solids to separate and stick to the base of the pan. The heat will brown these slightly, adding the light caramel flavor found in most canned evaporated milk. Just keep a watchful eye on the pot and whisk at least once every five to eight minutes so the milk solids don't scorch.Reduce heat and whisk vigorously if the milk rises above a low simmer.
A rubber spatula is the best tool for scraping the base. A whisk is best for preventing skin from forming. Alternate between these tools for the best result.

, Eyeball this based on the depth of the milk in the pan, or measure the volume in a heatproof measuring cup. If you started with 30 ounces (3¾ cups / 890 mL) of milk, turn off the heat once you're down to 12 ounces (1½ cups / 350 mL). The milk is now similar to store-bought evaporated milk, with a little more than half of its water removed.


The milk might be light brown or white, depending on temperature and how often you scraped the pan.

, It's normal for some spongy solids to separate out of the milk when you heat it. Pour the milk through cheesecloth or a fine mesh to remove these., Unlike the canned product, homemade evaporated milk is not shelf stable.That said, the lower water content does increase the shelf life, so it should last longer than regular milk.Store in an airtight container in a cold area of your fridge.


Evaporated milk does not freeze well.If you are storing the milk in a glass container, let it cool to room temperature before you refrigerate it. Sudden temperature changes can break glass.

This option works best if you use canned fruit labeled as ""in juice"" rather than ""in syrup,"" however, since many people often find syrups too sweet to drink alone.;
, Instead of buying flavored water by the bottle, save yourself some money by mixing your own. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of leftover juice to an 8-ounce (250-milliliter) glass of cold, clean water. You can add less or more juice depending on how strong you want the flavor to be.

, Anyone who enjoys lemon iced tea or raspberry iced tea should try expanding their fruit tea horizons by mixing their next batch of tea with leftover canned juice. Mix the juice from a 16-ounce (500 milliliter) can of fruit into a 2-quart (2-liter) pitcher of iced tea.


Experiment with different combinations. Mix the juice from canned pineapples, peaches, cherries, or mixed fruit into a pitcher of black tea. You could also try mixing the juice from canned peaches or apricots with iced green tea, or the juice from mandarin oranges with iced oolong tea.

, You can add another dimension of flavor to your favorite pre-packaged juices and juices from concentrate. Choose flavors that work well with one another. For instance, you could add juice from a can of mandarin oranges to a pitcher of citrus punch, juice from a can of pears to a pitcher of apple juice, or juice from a can of pineapples to a pitcher of orange juice.

, You can add your leftover juice to pre-flavored lemon-lime soda to give it a fruity twist, or you can add the juice to unflavored soda water. Lightly stir the fruit juice into the soda with a spoon, but do not over-stir or you will lose some of the carbonation.


Add 1 or 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 milliliters) of leftover juice, like the juice from mixed fruit or pineapples, to a 12-ounce (375-milliliter) can of lemon-lime soda.
Add the juice from a 4-ounce (125-milliliter) can of fruit, any variety, to an 8-ounce (250 milliliter) glass of seltzer or soda water.

, Pour the juice from canned fruit into an ice cube tray and freeze until solid. You can use this ice to add a slight hint of color and fruit flavor to water, or you could use it to keep a glass of juice cold without watering it down by using normal ice.

, Instead of wasting money on fruity, sugary popsicles, you can make your own. Simply pour the leftover juice from your canned fruit into a popsicle mold and freeze until solid.


You can mix and match juices to create frozen treats that are layered with flavor. Pour juice from one can of fruit into the bottom third portion of a mold. Pour juice from a second can into the next third, and juice from a third can into the final portion. Make sure that the flavors complement one another, though.
If you do not have a popsicle mold, you can create your own. Just pour the juice into a freezer-safe cup. Cover the cup with a tight layer of plastic cling wrap and carefully insert a wooden popsicle stick through the wrap and halfway down into the juice. Freeze the juice until solid and remove it from the cup.

, Add approximately 2 tablespoons (28.3 grams) of cornstarch for every 1/2 cup (125 milliliters) of cold juice. Mix to combine and heat the fruit sauce over medium to medium-high heat until it boils and thickens. Cool the sauce and drizzle it over ice cream, pound cake, or pudding.


Alternatively, you can use the leftover juice to create an icing for cinnamon rolls, biscuits, or cookies. Mix 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of juice from your favorite canned fruit with 1 1/4 cups (315 milliliters) of powdered sugar and 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 milliliters) of clear vanilla extract.

, Use leftover juice instead of water when making pre-flavored gelatin. Simply substitute part or all of the water the directions call for with juice from a complementary fruit. Do not use pineapple juice, however, since it will not allow the gelatin to set.

, Substitute half of the liquid called for in a cinnamon roll, quick bread, pancake, or muffin recipe with the canned juice. If you use the liquid from a can of fruit labeled ""in syrup,"" reduce the amount of sugar you use by about 1/4 the original amount, as well.

, Use the leftover canned juice in a fruity vinaigrette. Combine equal parts juice, olive oil, and vinegar. For juice from a can of pears or mixed fruit, consider using apple cider vinegar. For other juices, standard white vinegar or white wine vinegar may work best. Thoroughly mix the ingredients and drizzle it over a green, loose-leaf salad.

, When preparing oatmeal, creamed wheat, rice congee, or another type of breakfast porridge, replace 1/4 to 1/2 of the water called for with leftover juice from your favorite canned fruit. Your plain cereal will become much sweeter and tastier.

, Rice absorbs whatever liquid it cooks in. Water and broth are the most commonly used liquids, but you can also use juice from canned fruit. Replace 2/3 of the water usually used with the juice. Actual juice works much better than syrup.


Try using the juice from pineapples or mandarin oranges to cook white rice or basmati rice with a flair of tropical citrus taste.

, Add approximately 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of leftover pineapple, peach, or mixed fruit juice for every 1 cup (225 grams) of cold, cooked pasta. Toss the pasta until it is completely coated in the juice. Your dull, leftover pasta will be transformed into a simple yet fruity pasta salad that you can enjoy as a snack or light lunch.

, Combine 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) leftover juice with 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) vegetable oil and 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) vinegar. Place your meat into a large plastic baggie and pour the juice over it. Allow it to sit, sealed and refrigerated, for 30 minutes so that the flavor of the juice thoroughly soaks into the meat.


Try using juice from canned pineapples for chicken, salmon, or pork, juice from canned peaches or mandarin oranges for chicken, and juice from canned pears for pork.
If using an acidic juice like pineapple juice, reduce the amount of vinegar you use by half. Too much acid in your marinade can cause your meat to become tough.

, This works especially well with the juice from canned pineapples and mandarin oranges. Whisk together the juice from a 16-ounce (500 milliliter) can of fruit with 1/2 cup (125 milliliters) brown sugar. You can also add more sugar if you want a thicker or sweeter glaze.

Wash and hull your strawberries.,
Put the hulled strawberries in your pitcher.,
Crush the strawberries.,
Add sugar, if you want extra sweetness.,
Pour your water over the berries.,
Add lemon juice.,
Chill in the refrigerator.",How to Make Strawberry Water," “Hulling” basically means removing the core of the strawberry and the green leaves at the top. This is done instead of simply chopping the top of, because it allows you to remove the leaves at the top (which you surely don't want floating in your strawberry water) without wasting any of the delicious berry.The easiest way to do this is to use a regular drinking straw.Position your straw at the bottom of the strawberry.
Gently push the straw into the strawberry, so that it goes straight through the center.
Continue pushing until the straw comes out the other side, with the core and leaves inside the straw.
If you don't want to waste the strawberry cores or the drinking straw, you can just cut the leaves off your strawberries.;
, After you’re sure all of the cores and leaves have been removed, put them into the empty pitcher.It’s best to use something with a wide brim, because you will be inserting a spoon to mash the strawberries.


You can create this recipe in a drinking glass as well. If you want to make your strawberry water by the glass, simply halve or quarter this recipe.

, Using a wooden spoon or another utensil with a flat surface, muddle the strawberries.with a wooden spoon. Muddling means to smash the fruit in order to release their juices and intensify the flavor of your strawberry water.You don’t need to completely obliterate the berries, but make sure they’re all decently mashed to the bottom of your glass.

, If you’re trying to keep this recipe super health-conscious, you can skip this step and rely on the natural sugar of the berries. You can, however, add a bit of your own sugar to amp up the sweetness. Simply sprinkle or pour your sugar over the crushed berries, and then stir or mash it all together.


If you’re not sure if you should add sugar, first try making this recipe without this step. Then, you can add sugar to the finished glass of strawberry water if you desire.

, You can use tap water, filtered water, or even sparkling water – whatever water you enjoy drinking. Fill up the pitcher completely. You can give it a quick taste test at this point. The strawberries will continue to infuse into the water as it sits.

, This step is optional, but it can add another dimension to your strawberry water. Cut a lemon in half. Place one hand over the cut half, while squeezing the lemon with the other. Let the juice run through your hands into the pitcher, while catching the seeds with your cupped hand.

, Let your concoction chill overnight to get the maximum flavor out of the berries.If you don’t have time to let it sit overnight, feel free to drink as soon as it’s chilled. Serve your drink with ice cubes.


If you used sparkling water in your recipe, you should serve immediately so that the water doesn't lose it's fizz in the refrigerator.
You can also get creative and garnish your drink with sliced strawberries, sliced lemons, a sprig of mint, or even a yummy sugar rim!

Bring water to a simmer.,
Stir in butter if desired.,
Stir in the powdered milk.,
Cook the milk until it reaches the desired color and consistency.",How to Make Evaporated Milk2," If you have dry milk powder, you can make evaporated milk by mixing it with roughly 40% as much water as the label instructions suggest. To make the equivalent of one 12-oz can of evaporated milk, bring 1¼ cup (300mL) water to a simmer. The heat will add a slight caramel flavor characteristic of evaporated milk.

, Optionally, add 1 tbsp (15g) butter for a creamier taste.Add 2 tbsp (30g) for an extra rich evaporated milk, or up to 8 tbsp (115g) if you are using a skim milk powder and want to use the final result as a cream replacement.

, Add 1 cup (240mL) instant dry milk powder and continue stirring until it has dissolved completely.

, This mixture is already roughly as concentrated as evaporated milk, so you could use it right away. If you prefer a more caramel taste or a thicker consistency, cook at a simmer for five or ten minutes, stirring frequently.

Use these in recipes where the milk flavor is not important.,
Combine milk with half-and-half.,
Replace with other dairy products.",How to Make Evaporated Milk3," Because these substitutions are not cooked, it doesn't have the light caramel flavor found in most evaporated milk. It does have about the same fat percentage and consistency, however, so it works well as a substitute in baked goods and other recipes where milk isn't at the forefront.

, To substitute 1 cup (240 mL) evaporated milk, mix ¾ cup (180 mL) milk and ¼ cup (60 mL) half-and-half.Use the same type of milk called for in the recipe. For example, if the recipe calls for full-fat evaporated milk, start with full-fat regular milk.


If the recipe does not specify a type of evaporated milk, assume it means full-fat.

, If you don't have both milk and half-and-half, you can scour your fridge for last-resort alternatives:


Half-and-half is close enough to work as a substitute. You can substitute buttermilk instead if a tart flavor is appropriate.Cream is an extra-rich substitute. You could try half water and half cream as a rough alternative, but only in cooked sauces or soups, not in desserts or baked goods.
Whole milk is a risky substitute, as it will not thicken sauces as well as evaporated milk.

Squeeze the fruit with your hands.",How to Make Soursop Juice1," Look for a fruit with green skin that can be indented when you apply a little pressure with your thumb. A hard fruit with yellow-green skin should be allowed to ripen at room temperature for a few days.;
, You will come into direct contact with the flesh of the soursop, so your hands should be clean to avoid contaminating the juice.

, Dirt can get caught in between the bumps of the skin, so you may need scrub the fruit with your fingers to get it clean.

, In spite of its initial appearance, the skin is very soft and can be peeled by hand. You do not need to use a peeler or any other tools to complete this step.

, It is best to use a bowl with a wide mouth since you will need to work with the fruit while it is inside the bowl. The process can also get messy, so you may also want to choose a bowl with plenty of extra depth.

, Since the flesh is so soft, it should be easy to squeeze without the use of any specialized kitchen tool. Squeezing the soursop releases its juices, and squeezing the juices directly into the water or milk blends them together more thoroughly. By the end of the process, you should be left with a large piece of pulp held together by the fruit's fibrous core.

Slowly pour the juice through your strainer and into the bowl.,
Add other flavoring ingredients as desired.,
Give the juice a final stir before pouring it into glasses.",How to Make Soursop Juice2," The strainer should be small enough to fit over the bowl without any overlap, and the bowl should be large enough to contain all the liquid from your soursop. The strainer should also have fairly small gaps. The larger the gaps are, the more likely that pulp will get through.

, This process may take a while, depending on the size of your strainer.

, Typically, lime juice, ginger, and sugar make a good, authentic combination, as does a mix of nutmeg and vanilla.

, Serve it chilled or over ice.

Add more water if the juice is too thick.,
Serve the juice chilled or in glasses with ice.",How to Make Soursop Juice3," More of the pulp is broken down through blending, and it is left in the juice rather than getting strained out.

, Any pulp that fell from the core can remain in the liquid, but the core itself and the seeds should be removed.

, Do not worry about straining it first, and wipe up any juice that spills with paper towels.

, Try a combination of vanilla and nutmeg, or a mix of sugar, ginger, and lime.

, Blend for several minutes. The pulpy liquid should be smooth and creamy by the time you finish.

, Pour in 1/2 cup (125 milliliters) at a time. Blend again.

Customize your Milo recipe.",How to Prepare Milo1," This is the basic Milo recipe. Make it according to package directions, or customize it to fit your personal taste. For this recipe you will need:


3 tablespoons Milo powder
Hot water
Optional add-ins: Milk, cocoa powder, sugar, chocolate syrup;
, Milo does not dissolve well in cold milk so most Milo preparations begin with hot water. You can either boil water in a kettle, or heat it in a microwave-safe container for 1-2 minutes, until it just begins to steam.

, The package directions call for 3 tablespoons, but many Milo drinkers like to use a lot more, depending on personal taste. Begin with 3, and see how you like it. You can always add more powder later, or make it stronger next time.

, Add a few tablespoons of water first, and stir thoroughly to make a paste, then add more water and continue stirring until your cup is nearly full.

, You can add a few tablespoons of cold milk to your Milo to cool it off, and add create a creamier texture. You can also drink it plain, just be sure to let it cool off a bit if you made it with boiling water.

, Many people like to add additional ingredients to their Milo concoctions. Try the basic recipe first so you know what you're starting with, and then experiment with your recipe the next time around.


Add one teaspoon (or more) of sugar to the mug before you add the hot water for a sweeter drink.
Add one teaspoon (or more) of cocoa powder or chocolate syrup for a stronger chocolate flavor.
Substitute hot milk for the water for a creamier drink. Heat milk in a pan on the stovetop over medium heat until it just begins to bubble, or microwave for about 2 minutes in a microwave-safe container.

Prepare your strawberries for extracting juice.,
Set up the device you’ll use to squeeze out the juice from the strawberries.,
Use a juicer to extract strawberry juice.,
Use a blender to extract juice.,
Use a centrifuge to extract strawberry juice.If you’re a home chef who’s also into science gastronomy, using a centrifuge to extract strawberry juice is right up your ally.,
Pour your juice into a juice jug to serve.,
Serve your juice as desired.",How to Make Strawberry Juice1," To make a generous amount of juice, you’ll need to gather about two pounds of strawberries. Wash and cut the stems off of fresh strawberries, or thaw frozen strawberries.;
, There’s more than one type of kitchen gadget you can use to extract juice from strawberries. You can use a juicer, a blender, or a centrifuge, a rare kitchen gadget commonly used in labs, which uses rotational forces to separate high and low density particles.Not all juicers are made the same, but a typical assembly involves attaching a blade, filter, chute, and juice and pulp containers to a juicer base. Connect the juicer to an electrical outlet and make sure it’s set to “on.”
A typical blender assembly involves inserting a blade inside of a container and connecting the container to a base, which plugs into an electrical outlet.
A kitchen centrifuge is a small rectangular machine that spins several bottles on a rotor at a high speed to apply gravitational force. It may already come assembled. If not, assembly usually requires you to lift the top and secure the rotor on the base. The rotor should have a number of holes which hold bottles. You’ll fill those bottles with contents, and then place them in the holes of the rotor.

, You’ll likely have to use a pusher to push the fruit into the blades. While holding the pusher in one hand, use the other to fill the chute with strawberries. Use the pusher to press the strawberries into the blades. The juicer will shoot the juice into one container, and the pulp into another. Continue pushing the strawberries through the juicer until they’re all juiced. You should have a generous amount of juice to drink.

, Fill the blender with your strawberries, cover with a top, and blend until smooth. Pour the mixture through a sieve or strainer to separate the juice from the pulp. Alternately, you could use a centrifuge to separate the juice from the pulp.

, Take strawberry puree that’s just been blended and pour equal amounts into the bottles. Weigh the bottles to ensure they’re equal. Place the filled bottles into the rotor, close the centrifuge, and set it to maximum speed for about ten minutes. The force of the machine will draw heavier particles, like the pulp and seeds, to the bottom; while the lighter weighing juice will float to the top.

, Once you’ve used your designated kitchen gadget to release the juices from the strawberries, you can now pour the juice through a sieve or strainer to make sure all of the pulp is separated from the juice.


If you’ve used a juicer, you won’t need to do this because the machine has already done it for you.
If you’ve used a blender, wait for the contents in the container to settle, about 10 minutes. The juice at the bottom should look a lot darker than the juice at the top. Pour the mixture slowly through a sieve. Press the pulp with a spatula or the back of a large spoon to squeeze out as much juice as possible.
If you’ve used a centrifuge, pour the mixture slowly through the sieve to keep from disturbing the heavier contents at the bottom.

, You can allow your fresh strawberry juice, to cool in the refrigerator before serving, or add ice to serve immediately.

Pour the mixture into the strainer.,
Stir the sugar or agave nectar into the juice.,
Refrigerate the juice long enough to chill it.",How to Make Sorrel Juice1," A 2 1/2-quart (2 1/2-liter) bowl should be large enough, but if possible, you should consider using a 3-quart (3-liter) bowl to make sure that the ingredients do not overflow.;
, Use in any cloves, cinnamon, orange peel, or ginger you wish to use, and toss lightly with a spoon or fork to combine. You can skip one of these ingredients if you prefer the taste of sorrel juice without it, but you should include all four for the most accurate taste. Do not add sugar or agave yet.

, Stir to mix slightly.

, Allow it to sit in a sunny location for 8 hours or overnight. The sun warms the mixture enough for the flavors to combine, but even if you do not have a sunny location to sit the mixture in, allowing it to settle overnight should also mix the flavors thoroughly enough.

, Use a strainer with small gaps to separate as much juice as possible, since strainers with large gaps may allow sepals, orange peel, and cloves to get through.

, The red liquid should escape into the pitcher, leaving behind the solid ingredients, such as the sorrel sepals.

, Use one or the other, but do not use both.

, Serve with ice, and store any remaining juice in a sealed pitcher with a lid.

Prepare your strawberries.,
Put strawberries and other ingredients into blender.,
Blend for a minute or two.,
Taste test your juice.,
Strain your juice to remove the pulp and seeds.,
Enjoy your strawberry juice.",How to Make Strawberry Juice2," Rinse two cups of fresh strawberries under cold water and remove their stems. If you only have frozen, gather the same amount, which is about 18 to 20 strawberries, and allow them to thaw. You’ll want your frozen strawberries to thaw so that your juice will be more like a smooth liquid as opposed to a thick smoothie.


This amount will create two servings of juice. If you plan to serve more than two people, then double or triple the amount of strawberries as needed. You’ll also need to increase the amount of the remaining ingredients accordingly.

, This simple strawberry juice will be pureed in a blender, so all of your ingredients can be added at once.Add to your blender the strawberries, a teaspoon of lemon juice, two tablespoons of sugar, a pinch of salt, and two cups of water.


Remember, if you’ve doubled or tripled your strawberries, make sure you double or triple the amount of the additional ingredients as well.
Salt is optional. While adding salt helps bring out the sweetness of the juice, if you’re trying to limit your salt intake for health reasons or as a personal preference, then it’s not necessary to add.
The amount of sugar you use depends on taste and need. Your strawberries may already be so sweet that you won’t need much, if any, sugar. Alternately, they may not be sweet at all, and you may need more sugar than recommended.

, Ingredients should be well mixed and pureed.

, Is your strawberry juice too sweet or not sweet enough? Adjust the taste of your juice as needed. If it’s too sweet, then add a little more water. If it doesn’t taste sweet enough, you can add more sugar. Add a couple of teaspoons of sugar at a time to keep from adding too much sugar to your juice.

, This step is optional, but if you prefer the feel and taste of pulp-free juice, pour your juice through a fine meshed strainer before serving. Place the sieve over a juice jug to pour your juice directly into your serving container.

, You can either chill your juice in the refrigerator for a couple hours before serving, or add a few ice cubes to a glass to serve immediately.

Prepare your strawberries.,
Put half of the chopped strawberries into a large bowl and cover with one cup of sugar.,
After 24 hours, remove the bowl from the refrigerator and pour the mixture into a saucepan.,
While the mixture is simmering, wash the large bowl used for marinating the strawberry and sugar mixture.,
Once the mixture finishes simmering, carefully pour it through sieve to make sure it doesn’t splash or burn you.,
Pour the strawberry syrup into a sterilized glass bottle.,
To make strawberry juice using the syrup, mix ¼- cup of the syrup with one cup of water.",How to Make Strawberry Juice3," Wash two pounds of fresh strawberries. Remove the stems and cut the strawberries in half. If your strawberries are frozen, allow to thaw before slicing in half. It is possible that using frozen strawberries in this method may alter the taste a little, so try to use fresh strawberries if you can.

, Top with the remaining chopped strawberries, and then cover those with the rest of the sugar. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or foil paper and let sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours., A saucepan is deep cooking pan. If you don’t have one, a large pot will suffice. Put the pan on the stove and heat over medium-high heat. Keep a close eye on the mixture as it comes to a boil to prevent it from burning. When it begins to boil, reduce the heat and let it simmer for 30 minutes.

, Place a sieve or strainer over the bowl. The mesh of the sieve or strainer should be fine to prevent the tiniest of food particles, like the seeds, from passing through.

, Once poured through, the cooked strawberries should be left in the sieve. Using a spatula or the back of a large spoon, smash the strawberries into the sieve to squeeze out any remaining juices. You now should have a bowl of hot strawberry syrup.

, The sterilized bottle will ensure that the mixture lasts for longer than a few days in your refrigerator. If you have one, put a funnel cup inside the spout of the bottle to keep from spilling the syrup over the sides. If you don’t have a funnel cup, transfer the mixture into a container with a spout. This should make it easier to pour the syrup into the bottle without spilling it. Top the bottle with the sterilized cap and allow the bottle and the mixture to completely cool before storing in the refrigerator.


To sterilize a glass bottle, wash the glass bottle and then place on a baking sheet in an oven preheated to 170 degrees. Let it sit for 30 minutes.
Put the cap of the bottle in a small bowl and pour boiling water over it. This will sterilize it.
Remove the bottle from the oven with an oven-mitt or thick towel to be safe. Wait until it is cool enough to touch before filling with the strawberry syrup.

, Add more strawberry syrup if you’d prefer it sweeter. Or add more water if it’s too sweet. You can spice up your strawberry juice by using soda water instead. Or if you’re having an evening event, use the strawberry syrup to make a strawberry cocktail.

Drink water.,

Try coconut water.,
Make your beverages cold.",How to Quench Thirst Fast1," Water is by far the best choice for your body. Other than being refreshing, free, and easily accessible, it can also help you maintain a healthy weight. People who drink more water tend to take in fewer calories throughout the rest of the day.If plain water is too boring, mix in a sugar-free flavor additive or add slices of orange or cucumber.;
, It’s a myth that caffeinated beverages will dehydrate you. While caffeine itself is dehydrating, the water in tea and coffee more than makes up for it. Make it more refreshing by adding ice to create iced tea or iced coffee., Sports beverages like Gatorade and Powerade contain electrolytes, which are important minerals that your body loses when it sweats. So if you’re thirsty after exercising or being out in the heat, choose one of these high-sodium drinks., Carbonation can make a drink more refreshing and influence you to drink more liquid than you would have otherwise. It won't hydrate you any better than other beverages – it just quenches your thirst quickly.Opt for a diet soda or sparkling water in order to cut out any extra sugar.

, The clear liquid in the center of a coconut is the coconut water, and it's become one of the fastest-growing beverage categories in the industry. It's not only refreshing but also packed with vitamins, nutrients, and electrolytes, so it's another good option for rehydrating after a workout., Cold drinks have been shown to reduce thirst more effectively than warm or room temperature beverages. Add ice to your drink or store a pitcher of water in the fridge so you always have access to chilled water.If you need to chill a beverage quickly and don’t want to water it down by putting ice in it, try placing it (in a sealed bottle or can) into a bowl with water, ice, and a generous amount of salt. This will chill it in about five minutes.For on-the-go cold drinks, fill a thermos or insulated water bottle with ice but no water. This will cause it to melt more slowly.

"
Examine your environment for suitable edges, crevices, slots, holes and shapes that might allow a bottle-top to be inserted.,
The easiest method is using a pair of (strong) scissors.,
Use a spoon (bigger is better), put the small tip of the spoon under the cap, your hand around the neck of the bottle and pop.,
Try opening the bottle with a lighter.,
Super (or stupid :-) Party trick!,
Try vending machines.,
Try household items.",How to Open a Bottle Without a Bottle Opener1,";
, Open the scissors and place them slightly off parallel (facing in toward the bottle) against one of the ridges of the crown. Cut through one of the small ridges and continue in a circle until the cap can be removed.

, It's like a lighter, but much easier and much quicker.

, It's not as easy as you'd think, but it's a knack which converts swear by. Flat-sided lighters work best.


Grip the bottle firmly, holding the neck in a thumbs-up manner, with your thumb on the cap. Your fingers should be wrapped around the neck of the bottle; the top finger should leave a lighter's width from the cap.






Insert the lighter bottom between your top finger and the bottom of the cap, aiming above the centre of the bone between your knuckle and first finger joint, such that the lighter is perpendicular to the finger bone.






Tighten your grip of the bottle and wrap that lighter lever around your finger. If you're holding the bottle right, the cap will pop off. Try it a few times to get the grip right, and it won't hurt.






, The key is leverage and not impeding (ie touching) the cap in any way except for the lever. Use the largest knuckle of the index finger as the fulcrum for your lever (google ""fulcrum"" and think of the Bic lighter as the lever, see below). This method can easily, forcefully, and loudly launch the bottle cap more than 10 feet (3.0 m) in the air, depending on the bottle. I've gotten some good, loud, launches with Samuel Adams but most any pry off beer cap will do. Do NOT agitate the bottle -- it is NOT necessary. Due to the possible forceful ejection of the cap, be aware of your eyes and face -- a bottle cap to the eye could cause permanent damage! The old style full-size Bic lighter, which is somewhat oval shaped, works well due to its dimensions and its tendency to grip the underside of the cap with limited slippage.

, These are useful because they have a handy recessed coin return. Stick the cap in there and push down firmly. Use only strong metal installations

, It may be a hunt to find something effective:

Belt buckles work if they are the right shape. A spatula will work if you use the side






A common fork is a quick and easy method. Using one of the fork's teeth as a lever, push the grooves of the crown up and away from the cap, one at a time.






Children's ice skates may also work. The best skates for this purpose are the expensive ones with hollow sections in the blade. Unfortunately most people don't have those sort.






Car seat belt latches are the right shape for opening bottles. This is not recommended. If an alcoholic beverage is spilled in the car, it could lead to some very interesting questions if you are pulled over.






Metal nail clippers can be used to crimp off the lid. Open the clipper end as wide as possible, wedge one edge under the cap, and pry upwards. You should hear the compressed air being released. Go around the cap until it falls off.
Use the door handle that is located on the side of the door that is not open, apply pressure at an angle and voila its open for you!






A peeler, such as one you would use for a potato works alright. Hold the neck, hold the peeler upside down, an upward curve, unlike when you peel a potato. Get the curve under each edge, and pry each one off one by one. It should spin, but not come off. Then take the peeler, still upside-down, put it under one of the edges, and keep pushing, should pop right off.






Take two bottles, it is possible to open one of them - simply use the side of the cap as the lighter, described above, but be careful; if you don't use the side of the cap you might ending up opening the top one.





A paint can opener, the metal ones with the ring on the end work really well. Just put the nub at the top of the inside of the ring under the cap like a regular bottle opener.
The side of a regular radiator is usually rather efficient and spilling your beloved beverage is not too much of a problem. Just place the sticking-out part of the cap on the sharp edge of the radiator and pull down quickly and sharply.
Hotel hangers (the kind you can't steal), simply place the bottle under the bar, insert the cap into the hanger (where its connected to bar) and pop like a normal bottle opener.
A rubber jar opener - simply squeeze tightly over the cap, twist and pull.

A hammer works great. Turn it upside down, pry the forked end under the cap edges, and work your way around the cap. EASY and safe if you're comfortable using a hammer.






You can actually open a bottle using a piece of computer paper (thicker the better). Fold the paper in half as many times as you can, then hold the bottle in a similar manner as you would if attempting to open the bottle with a lighter. Tightly wedge the corner of the folded paper under the cap edge, and using as much force as you can, pry open the cap. It may take a few attempts, rotating the bottle each time to loosen the cap edges around the bottle. This method will certainly impress your audience, though it is one of the more challenging ways to open a bottle. Watch your hands, it is very easy to nick one of your knuckles holding the paper on the crown edge.

Avoid muddlers with teeth, since these tear up the leaves too much.A tough herb such as rosemary needs more breaking down. Follow the instructions for fruit instead.;
, Do not muddle in a delicate glass that may chip or break when struck. If the cocktail also calls for fruit, cucumber, or other non-herb ingredients, muddle them separately for best results.


Granulated sugar tears into the ingredients as you muddle. This can be overkill for soft herbs, so add it with the fruit instead, or dissolve it in a few drops of water and add it to the cocktail separately.

, Mint, basil, and other soft leaves release bitter flavors when crushed or torn apart. Just press down gently with the blunt tool while you twist your wrist, then release.Do this two or three times.


Use your dominant hand to muddle while you hold the glass steady with your other hand.

, The leaves are ready when lightly bruised, but still intact. You should be able to smell the herb, since the goal of muddling is to release flavorful, aromatic oils. You can leave the herbs in the final cocktail for presentation or strain them out, as desired.

, Cucumbers have the highest water content of any solid food (96 percent), so they’re the perfect choice for quenching your thirst when you’re not in the mood to drink anything. Celery is a close second, and the added crunch will give you some texture variety.Other example of water-rich vegetables are lettuce, spinach, and green peppers.

, While soup may not seem like the most refreshing option, a cold soup made of cucumber, greek yogurt, mint, and ice cubes can be blended quickly for a hydrating and low-calorie meal.Try other cold soup recipes like watermelon gazpacho, tomato gazpacho, or cool avocado soup.

One great tool is a staple remover.,
Also consider using the prongs from a lamp or other electrical device.,
Try sticking the bottle into a door jamb, at the metal plate.,
Alternatively, place the edge of the bottle cap on any edge (preferably metal).,
A wedding or class ring is an ideal way to remove a soda or beer bottle cap.,
Note that you can pry off the cap with virtually any strong metal with an edge that you have handy.,
You can use the back edge of a Chef's knife (use a knife with a wide enough blade so that the sharp edge is not on your skin), the handle of a serving spoon, tongs, a stainless bowl, closed scissors, a stapler, a screwdriver, a putty knife, a cocktail strainer handle.,
A pair of standard handcuffs make a good bottle opener, and often a simultaneous conversation-starter.",How to Open a Bottle Without a Bottle Opener2," Insert the two teeth upwards underneath the cap and pull up. Repeat this a couple times around the cap and it comes off, no problems.

, The prongs slip easily under the cap. Work around the edge and the cap can easily be removed.

, Close the door and twist the bottle down, and you might not lose any contents. A potential stained carpet from a spill reduces this method's attractiveness.

, Hit it with the palm of your hand. Don't use wooden edges, or you'll ruin them.

, (Warning: Gold wedding rings may be pulled out of shape using this method - you risk the wrath of your spouse by doing this!) Simply hold the bottle in the non-ring hand and place the ring hand, palm down, over the bottle cap. Hook the ring on the edge of the cap farthest from the palm of your hand, with the proper pressure the cap will pop off. Depending on the shape of the ring, you may experience some pain on the top of the ring finger and opening many bottles in a row may result in swelling, so use common sense. If it hurts too much or your finger swells, stop.

, Simply grab the neck of the bottle with the top of your hand even with the bottom of the cap. Lay the spoon handle, knife blade (sharp edge facing away) or whatever across the third knuckle on your first finger. Hook under the edge of the cap and pry up. If the metal is wide enough, it doesn't put enough pressure on your hand to actually hurt.

, Even a car key can work (eventually), but you'll probably tear up your cuticles pretty badly. If you don't care about the finish on the item, a hairbrush handle, a ceramic coaster, a remote control, a soup spoon, a hardcover book, a CD case... again, anything with an edge.

, Push the single strand (swinging part) of the handcuff through the ratchet, and hold it so that there is a gap of about 3/4"" (1.9 cm) between the double strand and single strand. Rest the single strand against the top of the cap. and hook the bottom of the double strand under the cap. Use the handcuffs to lever the cap off. Use only good-quality, NIJ-certified handcuffs, as cheaper novelty handcuffs may be damaged by this process.

Choose a muddling tool.,
Add small pieces to a sturdy glass.,
Add sugar if the recipe calls for it.,
Press and twist.,
Muddle until the fruit or vegetable releases aroma and liquid.",How to Muddle2," Citrus fruits, cucumbers, and other fruits and vegetables can take a fair amount of pressure. A broad muddler is a great choice, especially if it has teeth to break into the skin. You can also improvise with the back of a wooden spoon, a mortar and pestle, or any blunt instrument.Stainless steel or heavy plastic provide more heft than wood.Note that fruit juice will stain some plastics., Cut citrus fruit into wedges, and hard ingredients such as cucumbers into ¼ inch (6 mm) thick slices.Put these ingredients into a glass that you can press and grind without risk of chipping.


If using a mortar and pestle, put the ingredients in the mortar bowl instead.

, If you are using granulated sugar instead of simple syrup, add it now. Sugar will dissolve in fruit juice more readily than in alcohol, so incorporating it at this stage can save your cocktail from a gritty fate., Hold the glass steady and cup the end of the muddler with your dominant hand. Press the tool down steadily onto the fruit rather than bashing the glass. Press hard and twist, then release and repeat. You can press against the sides or base of the glass.

, The goal of muddling is to break up the peel and flesh to release flavorful oils and juices. You can stop when you smell a strong scent and see the ingredients release liquid, or continue muddling to intensify the flavor.


Citrus fruit can release plenty of bitter oils when muddled with prolonged force. This can work well in sugary drinks such as the caipirinha or mojito. Use a lighter touch when muddling for drinks with no added sugar.Cucumbers are ready after six or seven gentle presses.Press berries and other soft fruits until pulverized.

Locate a stand of coconut trees.,
Find a long straight tree branch 8–10 feet (2.4–3.0 m) trim off side branches.,
Take a bootlace or strip of cloth about three ft long.,
Pick out a coconut.,
Turn the stick so that the loop twists over the top of the coconut until tight.,
Inside the shell, you should find a layer of young coconut meat.",How to Obtain Coconut Water from Green Coconuts," The coconut trees should be twenty feet or less to gain access to green coconuts, preferably still on the tree. You may get lucky and find some wind fallen nuts.;
, If there is none available, you can use a fallen palm frond.

, Tie one end of the bootlace at one end of the branch or palm frond. Tie the other end about a foot or so further back on the branch, so that there is a hanging loop.

, Slide the loop under the coconut, pushing the loop over the coconut from the bottom up, bring the loop up past the top of the coconut.

, Pull down on the stick to retrieve coconut.


The inside shell containing the coconut water is very soft. Great care must be used in opening the young coconut. The tops of green coconuts can easily be cut off with a serrated knife, or you can find a large rock with a sharp point and using that point carefully peel off the husk.

, This is highly nutritious and delicious. Coconut water is so safe, pure and free of chemicals that babies and pregnant women can drink it.Water permeates through the husk and is naturally filtered.

Push the cork into the bottle.",How to Open a Bottle Without a Bottle Opener5," It works, although it is difficult with older wines, which may have penetrated the cork. Use a blunt instrument for maximum pressure. If you wish to ensure no spillages, do it in a sink. No one likes cleaning wine off carpets.

When heat energy is added to a material, the particle collisions speed up and travel farther apart, therefore weakening the attractive forces in the substance.",How to Open a Bottle Without a Bottle Opener6," Thus, the substance expands. Applying this knowledge of thermodynamics, the crown cap (metal) can be removed. Run the flame of a lighter around the cap of the bottle, then use something else to pry the lid off (knife, counter, etc.) This will make opening the bottle much, much easier than simply trying to pry the lid off. Remember, though, the mouth/neck of the bottle may temporarily be hot.

Hold the bottle pointing neck downwards, from the base (foil removed).

,
Rest a table knife (blunt edge leading) against the neck.

,
Slide the knife's blunt edge down the neck until it 'clicks' against the glass ridge that marks the start of the foil area.,
Wearing your gloves, twist the severed glass end off, hopefully taking the cork with it.,
If the cork did not follow the glass end, you must get a pair of pliers (or similar) to remove the cork, since the glass is chipped, and may be sharp.

",How to Open a Bottle Without a Bottle Opener7,",, Do it again, slightly more forcefully, again and again, until you hear the 'click' sound change to a 'crack'. You have neatly severed the glass neck, but the cork keeps it in place.

You will need a deep-threaded screw, (such as a decking screw), a screwdriver, a hammer and a prying surface at relatively the same height as the wine bottle's top.

,
Drive the screw into the center of the cork, leaving a small (1/2 inch/1.3 centimeters) amount out.

,
Use the hammer (against the prying surface) to pull the cork out of the bottle by the screw head.",How to Open a Bottle Without a Bottle Opener8,",,


Even better yet, just screw a screw into the cork until it clearly penetrates the cork. Now, just pour the wine through the cork! Voila! We are drinking now! It may pour slowly, but you won't get hurt. If you need a screw, un-screw one from something in your house and then put it back afterwards. Drink the whole bottle or seal the top with bubble gum, your choice!

Take a kitchen rug and fold it so that it's just a bit larger than the bottom of the bottle.

,
Put the rug over the bottom of the bottle, and then, holding the rug in place, bang the bottom of the bottle against a wall.,
Keep doing that, increasing the force of the blows, and the cork will slowly ease out of the bottle.",How to Open a Bottle Without a Bottle Opener9,", The movement of the bottle should be in the direction of its longest axis, and perpendicular to the wall.

,


If you don't have a kitchen rug handy, a thick sneaker may be used instead. Simply take off your (or a friends) shoe and place the bottle of wine in the sneaker, so the wine bottle is sitting snug inside of the sneaker. Holding the wine bottle steady inside of the shoe, drive the shoe into a wall, banging it as flat as possible. A few good blows against the wall should get you on your way. (Beware: the cork may pop out completely, spilling the wine everywhere. Keep an eye on the cork, once it is sticking out of the bottle enough to grab, stop the slamming and simply use your hand to pull out the cork.)
This doesn't work with all bottles and the wine may feel a bit bubbly after that - leave it open for a few minutes to settle before drinking, if you can wait that long.
There might be a problem with the wooden houses that are common in the USA. Works well with brick houses that are mostly used in Europe. An alternative to a wall is a door frame - it must be a solid, flat surface.

Set up a double boiler for melting the candle wax.,
Melt the candle wax.,
Add the coffee fragrance and color to your candle.,
Pour the melted candle wax into your mold.,
Remove the candle mold when the wax is dry.,
Trim the candle's wick.",How to Make a Coffee Candle," To make a mold for your candle wax, you can use the bottom half of a milk or juice carton. Cut the top half of the carton away with scissors, and then clean the carton thoroughly. Allow it to dry before using it as a mold.


You will need to punch a small hole in the bottom of the carton. Push a nail through the center of the carton bottom to form the hole; the wick will be threaded through this hole to keep it in place.
Spray the inside of your mold thoroughly with candle mold release. This product, which is available at craft stores, will prevent the mold from sticking and tearing away pieces of the candle wax when the candle is complete.;
, Cut a piece of candle wick that is a bit longer than the depth of your candle mold. You will need to position it so that it runs tautly down through the center of the candle while the wax cools around it.


Start by threading the candle wick through the hole in the bottom of the mold. Use a piece of tape to cover the hole and secure the excess wick in place.
Tie the other end of the wick around a chopstick or skewer stick. You should be able to lay this chopstick across the top of the candle mold with the wick held completely taut and straight.

, To prevent it from burning, the candle wax must be melted using the gentle, indirect heat from a double boiler. If you do not have a double boiler, you can easily set one up using a few pieces of kitchen equipment.


Fill a medium-sized saucepan with a shallow layer of water. Place the saucepan onto the stove and bring the water to a boil. When the water is boiling, reduce the heat just enough so that the water maintains a continuous but relatively low boil.
Place a large metal mixing bowl over the saucepan. The bottom of the bowl should not touch the water. You can now melt the wax in the mixing bowl without any risk of burning it.

, For a medium-sized pillar candle, you'll need about 1 pound (450 g) of candle wax, which can be purchased at a craft store in either pellet or block form. If you bought your wax in a large block, chop it into smaller pieces with a knife before melting it.


Place all of the candle wax into the double boiler. Stir it using a wooden spoon, scraping the bottom of the mixing bowl to prevent any wax from sticking and congealing onto the bowl.
The wax is finished melting when it is completely liquid and clear in color. At this point the wax will be around 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius).

, A small amount of coffee-scented fragrance oil can now be added and stirred into the melted wax. Brown candle coloring is optional, but can be added to give the candle an appearance to match its coffee scent.


Fragrance oil can be purchased at many craft stores. If you cannot find coffee-scented oil in your local craft store, you may have to purchase the oil online from a candle-making supply retailer.
The amounts of fragrance oil and color that you add will depend on your own preferences regarding the intensity of the candle's scent and color. Refer to the manufacturer's directions for guidelines on how much to add.

, Wearing oven mitts or thick gloves for protection, gently and slowly pour the melted wax from the mixing bowl into your candle mold. A slow pour will help minimize air bubbles that will mar the appearance of the finished coffee candle. Leave a small amount of space between the wax and the top of your mold to avoid spills.

, Candle wax should take about 12 hours to dry completely, but may take longer in high temperatures. When the wax looks and feels dry, remove the tape at the bottom of the mold and tap the bottom to loosen the candle from the carton.

, When the candle has been removed from the mold, untie the wick from the chopstick. Trim the wick so that it is flush with the bottom of the candle and extends about half an inch (1 cm) from the top of the candle.

Put on the lid and pulse the beans in two-second pulses for about 10 seconds. Add the next quarter of beans and repeat. Continue until you have the right quantity of coffee and the right consistency, about a minute.When you're done grinding, wash the blender thoroughly to remove the coffee aroma.
A blender is ideal for grinding coffee in a pinch, but you won’t get a consistent or fine grind. A blender is great for achieving a coarse grind.
Pulse the beans only in short bursts to prevent the blades from heating up and cooking the beans.;
, Measure your coffee beans and transfer them to the food processor. Grind the beans using five-second pulses for 10 to 20 seconds. Check the consistency of the grind, and continue processing the beans in short spurts until you have the consistency you want.Disassemble and wash the food processor when you're finished, otherwise the coffee smell will linger.
Like a blender, a food processor will only give you a coarse and uneven grind, but the coffee will still be drinkable.

, Place the beans into a tall and narrow container. Insert the blender into the container and cover the top with your hand to prevent the beans from flying out.Blend the beans for 20 to 30 seconds. Check the grind and continue processing in 10-second spurts until you achieve the right grind.


Rinse and wash the immersion blender and container right away to remove the coffee oils and scent.

Use a hand mincer.",How to Grind Coffee Beans Without a Grinder2," Measure 1 to 2 tablespoons (5 to 10 g) of coffee beans into the mortar. Cover the top of the mortar with one hand to stop the beans from jumping out. With your other hand, swirl the pestle around to mash the beans. After five seconds, pull out the pestle and bring it down in a vertical motion to hammer the beans.Repeat the swirling and hammering until you achieve the desired consistency.
Only grind small quantities of beans at a time in the pestle and mortar. This will ensure the most consistent grind.
A pestle and mortar will produce anything from a coarse to an super fine grind.

, Place the beans on a large wooden cutting board. Take a large butcher knife and lay the blade flat against the beans. Lay your open palm against the flat top of the blade and apply pressure to crack the beans. Once the beans have cracked, carefully slide the knife toward you. Continue applying pressure to grind the beans finer.Using this method, you'll be able to achieve a medium or medium-fine grind.

, Measure your coffee beans and transfer them to a thick plastic freezer bag. Seal the bag and place it on a flat surface. Shake the beans around so they're in a single layer. With gentle force, bring the rolling pin down onto the beans like a hammer to crack them. Once cracked, apply pressure and roll the rolling pin back and forth until you get the right grind.You can also place the beans between sheets of parchment paper if you don’t have a freezer bag at your disposal.
Using the rolling pin will result in a medium fine to fine grind.

, Place the beans between two pieces of parchment paper, or into a sealed freezer bag. Lay the bag on a towel on a flat surface and spread the beans out so they're in an even layer. Use moderate and consistent strokes to bring the hammer down on the beans to crush them. Keep hammering until you have a coarse to medium consistency.


You can grind beans like this using a hammer, meat tenderizer, or mallet., A hand mincer is a manual grinder that can be used to mince meat, make pasta, or grind just about anything, including coffee. Measure the beans and pour them into the grinder. Turn the crank arm with your hand in a clockwise direction to process the beans. To achieve a finer grind, collect the ground beans and run them through the grinder again."

Use a coarse grind for the French press.,
Go for a medium grind for a variety of brewing methods.,
Grind coffee finely for espresso.,
Use a super fine grind for Turkish coffee.",How to Grind Coffee Beans Without a Grinder3," Different coffee brewing methods require different grind consistencies. Coarsely ground coffee is about the size of breadcrumbs. You can achieve a coarse grind with a blender or food processor. This grind is ideal for:French press coffee
Cold brew
Vacuum coffee makers

, A medium grind is about the consistency of granulated sugar. This type of grind is best for drip coffee, the pour-over method, and Chemex brewers. In fact, medium grind can be used for a number of different brewing methods, but shouldn’t be used for espresso or Turkish coffee.A medium grind can be achieved by cracking coffee beans with a knife or a hammer. You can also get a medium fine grind by crushing them with a rolling pin.

, Professional espresso machines, home espresso makers, and stovetop espresso pots all require finely ground coffee for the best results.Finely ground coffee has a similar consistency to table salt.

Without a grinder, you can achieve a fine grind by grinding beans with a pestle and mortar or a rolling pin.

, Super fine coffee is a powdery grind that’s similar to powdered sugar. This type of grind is required for Turkish coffee and Greek coffee.You can get this grind using a pestle and mortar."

Choose the right coffee beans.,
Brew up an extra strength cup of coffee.,
Warm 1 cup of milk.,
Pour the hot milk and coffee into your cup simultaneously.,
Serve the café au lait immediately.",How to Make a Cafe Au Lait1," You want a bold, full-flavored bean to get the best drink. Fruity coffees, like many originating from Central America, often lose some flavor when mixed with the milk, and mild or light roast beans are not robust enough to provide the coffee taste you want. Aim for Sumatran, Java, or Brazilian beans, or dark-roasted beans with a big flavor.You can also use espresso beans, though you want to brew them like traditional coffee.;
, In order to avoid weakly flavored coffee, which may occur when the milk is added, you want a strong pot of coffee to start with. While some people suggest using espresso, a cup of espresso and steamed milk is technically a latté, not a café au lait.If you use a coffee maker, use twice as many ground beans or half as much water to get stronger coffee.

If you use a French press, or press pot, be sure to add an extra 2-3 spoonfuls of grounds, and let them steep in the hot water for at least 4 minutes., Scalding is just a culinary term for heating up the milk. You want to be careful not to foam the milk, just warm it up. Place it in a saucepan and heat it up slowly, on low heat, until it is just beginning to bubble and is hot to the touch. It should not be bubbling. You can also use the steaming wand found on an espresso machine, which will heat the milk up without the chance of burning it.


Use whole milk for the most authentic, rich café au lait taste you can get.
While a traditional café au lait has no foam, all milk drinks should be slightly foamed, as air bubbles improve the taste. Take a whisk to the milk for 10-15 seconds before removing it from heat to get the best flavored drink., You want equal parts of milk and coffee, and you want to avoid stirring it up if possible to reduce any foaming. To make this easier, you might transfer the warm milk into a heat-safe measuring cup before pouring.


While the ratios do not have to be exact, a café au lait is supposed to be half milk, half coffee. Add more or less milk to get a weaker or stronger cup.
If you are struggling to pour both simultaneously, then pour the milk first, then pour the coffee into the milk., If you want to emphasize the French aspect, you should serve the coffee in a small bowl, as the French do. For an Italian twist, serve it in a tall glass, usually with a handle (though most Italians use espresso instead of coffee).


Feel free to add sugar to taste, as most French drinkers add 1-2 packets.

To prepare a coffee cherry, begin by crushing the cherry with your hands or a wooden spoon. Rinse the inner beans with water and allow them to ferment for several days in a small container. The beans are ready once the remaining pulp falls off.
Wash the beans in a small tub of fresh water. Discard any beans that float.
Place the beans on a mesh screen and set the screen out in open, dry air in a space away from direct sunlight. Wait until the beans are almost completely dry to the touch.
Test the bean by carefully biting it open. It should be dry on the outside but a little soft and moist inside.;
, If you do not have access to fresh coffee cherries, purchase green coffee beans that have been recently harvested. Prepare these seeds by pre-soaking them in a small container of water for 24 hours.Beans are most likely to germinate if sown within the first four months after harvest. After this point in time, however, the likelihood that your seeds will germinate decreases dramatically.

, Fill a 2 oz (60 ml) container with agricultural sand or vermiculite. Spray the growing medium with water to moisten it, then plant one seed in the container by pushing it just beneath the surface of the growing medium.


Alternatively, you could rinse two burlap coffee sacks with water and sandwich the seeds in between these two sacks.

, Prior to germination, you need to make sure that the growing medium remains damp. Water twice a day, draining off any excess water so that the seeds are thoroughly moist but not swamped.


Fresh seeds should germinate after roughly 2.5 months, but older seeds may take as long as 6 months.

, After the seed germinates and produces a ""gooseneck"" shoot, carefully remove it from its growing medium and transplant it into a deeper pot. Prepare a hole that is 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) deep and carefully place the seed flat side down inside.


The growing medium in this pot should be loamy and have a high humus content. For additionally nutrition, consider mixing in rotted manure, bone meal, or dried blood. If you cannot use this sort of soil, use any lightweight, porous soil.
After planting the seedling in the soil, loosely sprinkle more of the soil over it. Do not press the seed down.
If you want to help preserve moisture, you can add 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of mulched grass on top.

, You should continue to water the seedling once each day. The soil needs to be continually moist, but should never be completely saturated. Wait until the seed fully germinates before transplanting it.


After another three to four months, you should have a tall stalk with a bean-like pod stuck on top. A month or so later, that pod should open up to reveal its primary leaves. After nine months pass, more leaves should develop and the plant should look more like a traditional coffee plant. You can transplant the seedling to its permanent container or outdoor location at that point.

, If you do not want to wait 9 to 12 months before transplanting your coffee seedling to its final location, skip the seeds and buy a pre-established seedling. Look for a seedling that is at least 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) tall, if not taller.You can check with your local nursery when looking for a coffee seedling. If they do not have any in stock, ask if they will order the plant for you.
Note that you can buy taller coffee trees if desired. The taller the tree is, the quicker you can harvest fruit from it. A young plant will still take seven to eight years to produce viable fruit, but an established plant will produce usable fruit in three to four years.

, If you live in a hot, humid climate, you might be able to grown your coffee tree outdoors. Choose a location with deep, porous soil that the roots can easily move through.


Ideally, the location should also be relatively shady and should provide ample shelter from cold or hot winds.
Coffee trees are delicate plants, so it is a good idea to transplant them near large trees with shady branches, buildings, or similar structures that can help protect the young trees as they grow.

, Most geographic regions of the United States and all areas of Canada are too cool to support a coffee plant outdoors. You can usually have success transplanting your seedlings into large pots indoors, though.


Choose a windowed room that lets in a minimum of four to five hours of direct sunlight. A room with bright artificial lighting can also work.
The room must remain at a temperature between 60 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (15 and 27 degrees Celsius) throughout the day. At night, it must not drop below 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 degrees Celsius).
The container you use will need to be very deep. Use a half wine barrel or similar pot that holds roughly 20 to 25 gallons (75 to 95 L).

, If planting the seedling outdoors, you should cut away any tall weeds before doing so. Improve the quality of both indoor and outdoor soil by amending it with coarse salt or basalt gravel dust. You can also add organic rotted manure.


Consider testing the soil. Ideally, it should have a high nitrogen content and a mildly acidic pH of about 6.

, Make a hole in your new soil that is just large enough to fit the current root system of your plant. Carefully remove the plant from its current container and slide it into this new hole. Leave the crown of the plant above the surface and pack the soil around the taproot firmly.If planting outdoors, plant your trees in rows spaced 3 yards (3 meters) apart. Dig holes roughly that are 20 inches (50 cm) in depth, width, and length.
If planting indoors, plant one seedling into the center of your prepared container. Dig a hole that is at least as deep and as wide as the current root system of your plant.

, To preserve the moisture and nutrients in the soil, you should cover the soil with a loose, light layer of grass mulch or rotting leaves.


If planting the trees outdoors, you could also plant a cover crop, like legumes. Legumes are especially helpful since they provide extra nitrogen.

, If you plant the tree outdoors and it receives plenty of natural rainfall, you do not need to water it separately. If you plant it indoors, however, you should water the tree twice a week using a full watering once and a half watering once.


For a full watering, soak the soil then allow the excess to drain. Soak the soil a second time and let the excess drain again. You can also add fertilizer during this second round of watering.
For a half watering, soak the soil once and allow it to drain.
During the winter, reduce watering to once a week for two to three months.
After the tree establishes itself and begin to produce a steady crop, you can reduce watering to once a week.

, Your first application of fertilizer should be six weeks after you transplant the tree. Apply a citrus fertilizer, and continue adding it once every six weeks during the warmer months.After the first six months pass, switch your schedule. Apply fertilizer once every two weeks from March through October, then once a week from November through February. Use a high-nitrogen fertilizer suitable for use with orchids.
Always apply fertilizer during the latter half of a full watering.

, Pruning is not strictly necessary, but if you want to keep the plant small, you should begin to prune the leaves once the tree reaches 20 inches (500 mm) in height. Cut or pinch away the growing tips of each stem to encourage lateral branching.


Note that many professional coffee plantations prune trees to the ground every three years to encourage new growth. If you area only planting a small home-grown coffee plant, though, this much pruning could shock the tree and weaken it severely.

, On average, a coffee tree will need nine years before it produces usable fruit.


Within two or three years, you might see some flowering and a few green coffee cherries.
The flowering phase will last for about one month. After it ends, the flowers will turn brown and fall off the plant.
Over the next six to eight months, the tree will be in its fruiting phase. If the cherries reach a deep red color, they can be picked. If they drop off naturally before reaching this color, however, the tree is not yet mature enough.

, Coffee cherries are ready to be picked when they turn a deep crimson color. Pick the beans by simply twisting and pulling them off with your fingers.


Note that each berry has two beans inside.
You will not be able to harvest all of the berries at once since they will all ripen at different paces.Harvest your berries once a week.

, If you want to use the coffee beans to make actual coffee, you will need to remove the beans from each cherry and dry them out.


Open the cherries and remove the beans. Allow each bean to ferment by soaking it in water for several days. When bubbles form and the beans feel gritty, washing them in fresh water.
Spread the beans out in the sun for seven days. When ready, they will crack when squeezed between your teeth.
Remove the outer parchment and silver layers of skin, leaving only the green bean behind.
Roast the inner green beans for 10 minutes in an oven preheated to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).

Because you're going to be adding ice and watering down the beverage, it’s a good idea to start with a double shot, which requires about 20 g of coffee.Transfer the measured coffee beans to a grinder and grind them to a fine grind.

A fine grind means the coffee will be about the same size as table salt.;
, Transfer the coffee grinds to the portafilter. Use the tamp to press the beans into a compact puck. Place the portafilter back into the group head, and turn the handle to lock it in place. Place a cup below the portafilter. Turn on the water and let it run for 30 seconds. Turn off the water to stop extracting the shot.To make sure there's room for the milk later, pull the espresso into a 6- or 7-ounce (177- to 207- ml) cup.

, You can still make an espresso-type beverage without a proper machine, though you'll get the best results with a dedicated espresso maker. To make espresso at home without a machine, you can:

Use a stovetop moka pot. Fill the lower water reservoir with the water, and place the metal basket inside the reservoir. Fill the metal basket with the coffee grinds, and then twist on the lid and upper reservoir. Heat the moka pot over medium heat until coffee fills the upper reservoir.Brew a strong pot of coffee. As a last resort, you can also brew coffee that’s twice as strong in place of the espresso. So if you normally use two scoops of coffee to make a two-cup pot of coffee, use four scoops and brew a pot.

, Pour the cold milk into the metal steamer jug. Insert the steam wand into the jug at a 45-degree angle, and position it so the tip is just below the milk’s surface. Turn on the steam and heat the milk to 149 F (65 C), until the milk has doubled in volume, or until the jug is very hot to the touch.Heat the milk in a saucepan on the stove to steam it without an espresso maker. Bring the milk to a simmer over medium heat, but don’t let it boil. Simmer the milk for about five minutes, until it’s hot and bubbly.A cappuccino is made up of equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam, so you'll froth twice as much milk as you have espresso.

, Swirl the milk around in the jug to help produce more foam. Hold the milk jug directly over the espresso cup and pour the milk into the espresso in a single pour. Gently shake the milk jug at the end of the pour to get the foam out as well., You can also add some sugar to the cappuccino if you like your coffee drinks sweeter. It’s a good idea to add the sugar now, so the sugar dissolves in the hot coffee. If you add the sugar later to the iced beverage, it won’t dissolve and will stay in granular form.

After adding the sugar, gently stir the cappuccino to distribute it and help it dissolve.

, Let the cappuccino cool for about 30 minutes, and then transfer it to the refrigerator to chill.Let it chill for another 30 to 60 minutes. Otherwise, if you make the iced cappuccino when the coffee is still hot, it will just melt the ice cubes and won’t take on a frothy texture.

It’s important to let the drink cool before transferring it to the refrigerator, otherwise the temperature change could shatter the glass.

, Remove the chilled cappuccino from the refrigerator and pour it into the blender. Add between five and 10 ice cubes to the blender as well. Less ice will produce an iced cappuccino with a slightly stronger coffee flavor.


Combine the coffee and ice in a tall mixing cup if you want to use an immersion blender instead of a blender to make the iced cappuccino.

, You can customize the flavor of your iced cappuccino by adding different syrups or flavor shots.Add 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 ml) of your favorite flavor shot to the blender. Popular additions for a cappuccino include:

Hazelnut
Vanilla
Chocolate
Caramel
Maple (you can also use real maple syrup to sweeten and flavor your drink), Put the lid on the blender and set it to the ice crush or smoothie setting. Blend the ice and coffee together for about a minute.The mixture is ready when the ice has been crushed finely, there are no large chunks of ice left, and the cappuccino and ice have been blended together into a smooth and creamy beverage., When the blended iced cappuccino is ready, pour the mixture out of the blender and into a tall glass. Make sure to leave room for whipped cream and other garnishes if you so desire.

, Whipped cream is a popular and delicious way to finish any iced coffee beverage. After transferring your blended iced cappuccino to a tall serving glass, add a few dollops or a swirl of whipped cream to the top for an extra-sweet treat.You can use regular dairy-based whipped cream for your coffee, or non-dairy coconut whipped cream as well.

, Whether you add whipped cream to your iced cappuccino or not, you can still garnish the top with chocolate or cocoa powder.To add cocoa, sprinkle a pinch of powder evenly over the surface of the beverage. To add chocolate, use a vegetable peeler to shave a few curls of chocolate off a bar and onto the beverage.

If you do garnish with whipped cream and chocolate, add the whipped cream first and the chocolate or cocoa on top.

, You can also garnish your blended iced cappuccino with spices. Sprinkle a pinch (about ⅛ teaspoon (0.3 g)) of your favorite ground spices on top of the beverage or the whipped cream right before serving. Popular spices to pair with coffee drinks include:

Cinnamon
Nutmeg
Ginger
Allspice
Cloves

, Cookies and coffee are a tasty combination, and there are many different types of cookies that you can pair with your blended iced cappuccino. Some of the more traditional or popular cookies to serve with coffee include:

Biscotti
Ginger snaps
Shortbread
Pistachio cookies

Understand the different types of café au lait.,
Add a dash of foamed milk to the top for a gorgeous cup of café.,
Add a dash of chocolate to your café au lait.,
Use equal parts chicory and coffee for a New Orleans Café au Lait.,
Cool the coffee and milk, then mix in a blender with a handful of ice for an iced café au lait.",How to Make a Cafe Au Lait2," Because the term ""coffee with milk"" is so vague, there are a lot of variations on café au lait across the world. The most common difference is between European and American café au lait. Whereas Europeans always steam them milk with an espresso machine, American café au lait has milk scalded in a saucepan.Lattés are made with 2-3 shots of espresso and warmed milk, not brewed coffee.

Cappuccino's are like latte's, except the majority of milk has been foamed, not just warmed.

Macchiatos are shots of espresso with a dollop of foamed milk on top., While café au lait is supposed to be light on foam, a thin topping is often used to make the cup look good and provide a little dash of sweet foam to the coffee. If you have some milk left over, whisk it with 1-2 teaspoons of sugar until it starts to froth, then pour it over your cup of coffee.

, Add 1⁄4 tablespoon (3.7 ml) sugar and 1⁄2 tablespoon (7.4 ml) unsweetened cocoa powder (per mug of coffee you're making) to your milk right before whisking. The result is a mocha-café au lait hybrid that is perfect as a nightcap or along with brunch.


Substitute 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, or one whole vanilla bean, for the cocoa powder to change things up. Scrape the seeds out of the vanilla bean and into the milk, then heat it with the milk and sugar for 5-10 minutes on low., Made famous by Louisiana's Café au Monde, this creole version of the french classic is the only way you'll be served in the Big Easy. You can buy premixed chicory/coffee blends or measure in your own ground chicory to taste.Whenever possible, you should serve it with sweet beignets to offset the bitterness of the chicory.

, Technically, since the milk is not warmed, this is not a café au lait. That said, this iced treat has a the flavor of café au lait for a warm day. Add any extra sugar to taste.

You will need about 1/2 cup of milk for every cappuccino.






;
,









If microwaving, place the cup of milk into the microwave and heat on high for approximately 30 seconds, or until steam begins to rise from the milk.
If using the stove, place the saucepan on a preheated burner, set to medium. Heat until steam rise from the milk.

, Once the milk is heated, place the wire whisk into the milk and twirl the handle between your palms to create foam. Keep twirling the whisk until you achieve the desired amount of foam.








, Pour a 1/2 cup of milk into a glass jar. The milk should not rise above the halfway point, as you need to leave enough room for the froth to expand.








, Tightly replace the lid, then vigorously shake the jar until the milk becomes frothy and has almost doubled in size. This should take about 30 seconds.








, Take the lid off the jar and place it in the microwave. Heat on high for approximately 30 seconds, or until steam begins to rise from the milk. The foam should begin to stabilize in the microwave, rising to the top of the milk.







, The fresher and colder your milk is, the better. You will produce nicer foam and the cappuccino will taste better.








, Whole milk, or half-and-half tend to foam better than milk with a lower fat percentage, such as 2% or skim. Whole milk also tends to produce a sweeter tasting foam than low-fat milk. However, the type of milk you use is largely a matter of preference, and you can still produce good results with low-fat milk.







, Of course, the quality of your cappuccino doesn't just depend on the foam, it will also depend on how good you coffee is. Use strong, good-quality coffee and make sure it's nice and hot. You should prepare the coffee before you prepare the milk.








, Once the foam is heated, give the cup, saucepan or jar a quick swirl followed by a light tap on the kitchen counter. This causes any large bubbles to pop, compressing the foam.







, When adding the milk to the coffee, you should use a spoon to hold back the foam until the cup is 2/3 full. Then use the spoon to scoop the foam on top of the milky coffee.








, To make the perfect cappuccino, sprinkle a little cocoa powder or even grated chocolate on top of the foamed milk. The heat should cause the chocolate to melt slightly. Enjoy!

, If you have a fancy French press, you want the beans to be ground coarsely so they resemble cracked peppercorns or potting soil. The larger pieces of bean will create a cleaner cup of coffee, whereas a finer grind would result in a muddier final pour.


If you have a Chemex or cafe solo brewer, grind it coarsely and give it just one extra pulse. Chemex and cafe solo brewers require a medium coarse grind.

, This is the most popular type of coffee maker, so chances are you'll need to grind your beans to medium at one point or another. Use this grind for both cone or flat-bottomed filters. A medium grind is the texture of sand.


If you have a pour over cone, a vacuum pot or a siphon dripper, use a medium-find grind.

, If you're making special coffee, you'll need a special grind. A fine or extra-fine grind is the texture of flour. This can only be achieved with a burr grinder.

, You've determined what grind level you need for your coffee maker, so make sure your grinder is up to the job. There are three main types of grinders to choose from, and they're each great for different grind levels:A blade grinder is perfect for very coarse, medium coarse, coarse, or medium grinds. This is the most common type of grinder since it works well for drip coffee makers, French presses and cold brew makers alike. The beans are put into the top of the grinder, and when you put the lid on and press it down, it activates a blade that chops up the beans.
A burr grinder is necessary to achieve medium fine, fine and very finely ground coffee. Blade grinders simply can't cut it that finely. If you're making Turkish coffee or Espresso, you need a burr grinder for it to come out right. Burr grinders are more expensive than blade grinders, but you can set them to any level of grind. Get this grinder if precision is important to you.
Finally, you can use a hand grinder if you like to do things the old-fashioned way. You load the beans in a canister and pump a handle that causes the blades inside to churn. This type of grinder is fun to use, but it won't give you as precise a grind as the electric grinders.

, You might be tempted to grind up enough to last the week, and while this might be convenient (and keep your partner happy, since the noise of a grinder isn't the prettiest sound to wake up to every morning), your coffee will taste better if you use freshly ground beans. You bought whole beans and you have a grinder, so you might as well get the most out of your coffee every day.

, Measure out about two tablespoons of coffee beans per cup. This differs slightly according to taste, but it's the generally rule for making coffee. If you like your coffee strong, use about two tablespoons of beans per six ounces; if you're a fan of slightly watery coffee, use two tablespoons of beans per eight ounces.


Your individual grinder and coffee maker will also play a part in the strength of your coffee. Experiment to figure out exactly what amount of beans to use for your particular setup to come up with coffee that tastes sublime.
Place the beans in the grinder according to the manufacturer's instructions. Most grinders have a canister near the top of the machine with a lid you remove and replace.

, Operate the grinder according to the manufacturer's instructions. If you have a burr grinder, all you need to do is set the grinder so that it performs the proper grind. If you have a blade grinder, push down on the top or press the button to pulse the beans until they reach the proper grind. And if you're using a hand grinder, pump the handle until the beans are ground.


With a blade grinder, you'll need to lift the grinder and shake it up a little between pulses. This ensures the beans get properly ground.
It might take a few tries before you figure out how to use your grinder to get the exact grind you want.

, Put your beans in the blender and use the pulse setting to grind them as finely as you can. You probably won't be able to achieve a finer grind than a medium to medium coarse grind, but this will be fine if you have a drip maker or a French press.

, Place the beans in the mortar and grind them with the pestle, as you would grind peppercorns and other spices. Keep going until you've ground them to the level you need. It will take some elbow grease, but eventually you'll have enough to make delicious coffee.

, If you're really desperate, place the coffee beans between two sheets of waxed paper on a sturdy surface that won't get damaged by a hammer. Use a hammer to smash the beans until you've pulverized them to a grind suitable for your coffee maker.

Add spices directly to the coffee grounds.,
Swap your usual milk or cream with a different product.,
Purchase flavored syrups for your coffee.,
Add whipped cream to your coffee.,
Mix your coffee with liqueur.,
Make stove top espresso for a more bracing experience.,
Heat and froth milk yourself.",How to Get Creative with Coffee," An easy way to add some new flavors to your morning cup of coffee is by adding ground spices directly into the coffee grounds before brewing. By doing this, some of the spices' flavors will infuse into the cup.


Popular options for this method are cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, and grated ginger. You can add cocoa powder for an easy take on a cafe mocha, or even cayenne pepper for some heat.
Adding a pumpkin pie spice mix to your coffee grounds can help you create the warm, nutty flavor of pumpkin-themed seasonal lattes served at specialty coffee shops.
Note that spices like nutmeg, ginger, and cardamom will provide the fullest flavor if they are freshly grated just before brewing.;
, Many people add milk or half-and-half to their coffee every day. To get a little more creative with coffee, try adding a product such as rice milk, soy milk, or almond milk. You might be surprised how much the taste imparted by these milks can transform your cup of coffee. Substituting these products for half-and-half may also help you cut down your fat intake.

, An enjoyable aspect of visiting specialty coffee shops is the option of flavoring your coffee with a number of different syrups. These syrups are easy to buy, however, and can be easily used in your morning cup. Major brands like Da Vinci Gourmet, Monin, and Torani can be purchased online in small quantities. Use these syrups along with coffee and milk to create adaptations of favorite drinks like vanilla or hazelnut lattes.

, Whipped cream is usually reserved for dessert toppings, but it can also play a starring role in your morning cup of coffee. Add a big, rich spoonful of whipped cream to the top of your coffee, where it can easily replace the taste of your usual milk and sugar.

, If you are looking to make your coffee into a creative evening libation, you can add any number of liqueurs or spirits to your cup. Irish cream, hazelnut, almond, and raspberry liqueurs all pair well with coffee. For a stiffer cup, consider mixing your coffee with Irish whiskey for an abbreviated take on the classic Irish coffee cocktail.

, The espresso that you get from your favorite speciality coffee shop requires an expensive machine to create, but a halfway-point between drip coffee and espresso can be prepared using a stove top espresso maker or ""moka pot."" This rich, intense brew can be savored on its own or mixed with milk and sweeteners to produce classics like cafe au lait and cafe latte.


Stove top espresso can be mixed in equal parts with regular brewed coffee for a homemade take on a popular drink known as a ""black eye"" or a ""shot in the dark."" This preparation provides a strong flavor and high caffeine content while still maintaining a brew strength suited for sipping.
You can pour stove top espresso over ice cream or other dessert foods for a preparation called an affogato. The bitterness of the coffee can contrast against and add depth to the sweetness of ice cream or cake.

, If you prefer coffee with a large portion of milk, you've likely already gotten into the habit of heating the milk in a saucepan. However, if you want to mimic the luxurious texture of perfectly steamed milk, you can purchase a small tool called a milk frother. Pouring hot milk into this pitcher and then agitating it for a few seconds will produce velvety, foamy milk that pairs perfectly with thick stove top espresso and flavored sweeteners.

Notice how refreshed and calm you feel once you .",How to Give Up Coffee," If you drink a lot of coffee every day, about three or more cups every 24 hours, you may want to ease yourself off coffee gradually over a period of time. This will make it easier for your body to get used to less coffee and your withdrawal symptoms may not be as severe.You may start by cutting back from three cups a day to two cups a day for five days and then one cup for five more days. Then, for the final five days, you can go without any coffee. Often, if you are able to go for five days to a week without coffee, you are going to be able to give it up or replace it with healthier source of caffeine.;
, Alternatively, you can challenge yourself to cold turkey within a set time limit, for example, no coffee for a week. Keep in mind you may experience intense withdrawal symptoms during the first five to seven days of quitting coffee cold turkey.


Sometimes, giving up coffee cold turkey can be a good challenge, especially if you think you be addicted to coffee and want to get rid of the habit. You may also do a no coffee challenge with a friend, where you both cold turkey and support each other as you go through the withdrawal symptoms.

, On the first one to two days of no coffee, you may start to feel foggy and lethargic in the morning when you wake up and/or at the mid-point of your day. If you tend to have three or four cups of coffee a day at set times, you may feel sleepy or distracted at these times. These are all natural, if not unpleasant, symptoms of withdrawal.Some people also experience shaking and sweating when they are going through coffee withdrawal. You should prepare yourself for these symptoms so you can get through your day.

, Withdrawal headaches can be helped by staying hydrated with lots of water throughout the day. Try to replace all the cups of coffee you would have throughout the day with cups of water.If your headaches are unbearable, you can take over the counter painkillers. Follow the instructions on the label and only take the recommended dosage of the painkiller.

, Sleep can also be a good way to fight off withdrawal symptoms like lethargy or headaches. You may go to bed earlier than usual, especially during the first one to three days of giving up coffee. You can also try to fit in 30 minute naps during the day so your body can recover from the lack of coffee and sleep off any headaches.If you are struggling to get to sleep due to withdrawal symptoms, you may take melatonin. You can get melatonin over the counter at your local pharmacy or by prescription. If you have any existing health issues, you should see your doctor before taking melatonin.

, If your coffee withdrawal headaches turn into migraines, you should take medication and rest to fight them off. You may want to see your doctor if your migraines become debilitating and get prescription medication for them.Migraines are a typical symptom of coffee withdrawal because the absence of caffeine changes the blood flow and electrical activity in your brain. They should go away after a few days of no coffee as your brain will get used to the lack of caffeine and adjust accordingly.

, If you tended to use coffee as a way to stay pumped for the day and deal with stress, you may need to find alternative ways to work through any stress or irritability. You may substitute your morning cup of coffee with a morning run or walk, where you wake up with exercise. Or, you may take a morning yoga class to help you get set for the day, minus the coffee.


If you feel any stress or irritability throughout your day because you aren't able to have coffee, you can try doing a five minute meditation. Find a quiet, dim area and sit in a comfortable seated position. Close your eyes and think of a place that signifies calm and relaxation to you. This could be a sandy beach, a mountain view, or even your bedroom first thing in the morning. Try to sit still for five minutes and focus on your place of calm.
You can also use exercise and meditation to distract you from thoughts of coffee and any coffee cravings. When you feel a craving coming on, you can try doing a meditation or going for a walk or run to get your mind off coffee.

, One of the more popular replacement beverages for coffee is herbal tea. You can choose an herbal tea that contains caffeine, like green tea, or an herbal tea that is caffeine free, like chamomile tea. Herbal teas can be nice to have in the mornings and throughout the day as they give you something warm and calming to sip, but are still light and do not lead to feeling over buzzed. Tea has also been shown to be healthy for you as it is full of antioxidants.If you decide to switch to herbal teas, do some research and try several different types of tea to find ones that fit your tastes. You may want a light tea for the mornings, like a white tea, and a heavier tea in the afternoon, like a green or oolong tea. You may then have a lighter, caffeine free tea at night to help you sleep.

, Though hot water may seem like a sad replacement for coffee, it can help to keep you hydrated throughout the day and give you the illusion of sipping a warm cup of java.You can add in a slice of lemon or orange to the hot water to give it some flavor, but be careful of this option if you have acid reflux or stomach ulcers, as the citrus can aggravate your stomach acid.

, Dark chocolate contains caffeine and can be a good pick me up for when you are feeling sleepy or tired without your cup of coffee. Have a small piece of dark chocolate when you feel a headache or a drop in energy coming on, especially during the early stages of going without coffee. You can also have a piece of dark chocolate as a treat if you are able to go seven days without coffee and are trying to maintain a coffee free lifestyle., Try not to restrict yourself from being in coffee shops or smelling cups of coffee. Sometimes the smell of a fresh cup can be comforting enough, even if it isn’t for you.Coffee can have social qualities, and you may miss meeting up with friends for a chat at a coffee shop. You should still allow yourself the opportunity to meet up with friends at the local java spot, but substitute your regular coffee order with an herbal tea or hot water. This way, you still get the social benefits of talking over a hot beverage without indulging in coffee.

, Another element of coffee you may miss is the ritual of preparing your first cup in the morning. Create a ritual out of making your replacement beverage so it feels as important and essential as your cup of coffee. Over time, you may end up enjoying your replacement beverage more because you are able to prepare it and make it just the way you like it.If your replacement beverage is tea, you may want to read up on how to brew tea properly. You can also invest in a brewing basket, which you can place in a teapot or a travel mug to steep loose tea leaves properly.

, Many people who permanently report back with feelings of calm, alertness, and contentment. Once you get through the withdrawal symptoms, you may have very few cravings for coffee and feel like you could give it up completely.You may decide to cut back more on coffee but still indulge in it occasionally. This may mean having tea in the mornings and then one cup of coffee in the afternoon, or having only tea one day and then one cup of coffee the following day.
Another option is to cycle through your coffee habit, where you have coffee for a month and then give it up for one month. Then, the following month, you may gradually drink more coffee to build up your tolerance. Over time, your body gets used to caffeine and can become immune to the effects of caffeine, especially if you tend to drink coffee on a consistent basis. Cycling through your coffee habit can allow your body to maintain a balance and feel the effects of caffeine on a moderate basis."

Gather your equipment.,
Heat the water.,
Rinse the filter.,
Add the grounds.,
Pour the water.,
Serve as desired.",How to Make a Coffee1," Pour over coffee is made by pouring hot water over coffee grounds, and letting the resulting liquid drain through a filter into a cup or carafe. To make pour over coffee, you'll need a:Kettle or saucepan to heat the water
Coffee filter
Dripper that sits right on the mug or a Chemex coffeemaker to hold the filter
Alternatively, you can use a fine-mesh strainer lined with paper towel or a coffee filter to make pour over coffee in a pinch. Place the strainer over a coffee mug, line it with the filter, and prop the strainer up against something to hold it in place;
, Measure the water for your coffee and pour it into a kettle or saucepan. Bring the water to a boil. The ideal temperature for water to make coffee is between 195 and 205 F (90.5 and 96 C).Use six ounces for a regular cup, and eight ounces for a large cup.
When boiling your water, add extra to the kettle to account for evaporation and moisture loss.

, Peel open the filter and set it into the dripper cup. Pour a bit of boiling water into the filter and let it drain into the sink. This will remove dust and warm the dripper.


When the water has drained, set it on top of the coffee mug you'll use to drink your coffee.
You can also use a Chemex coffeemaker for pour over coffee. Open the filter and set it into the neck of the coffeemaker. Do not rinse the filter, as the water will drain into the carafe.

, Measure the coffee grounds out and place them in the coffee filter. The ideal water-to-grounds ratio is 16 ounces (473 ml) of water and 5 tablespoons (28 g) of coffee, which makes two large cups. To make a single cup, use half the water and half the grounds.To grind your own beans, measure out 2 heaping tablespoons of beans and grind them to a medium-fine grind.

, Once the water boils, let it rest for a few seconds to let the boil settle. Then, pour just enough water over the grounds to saturate them, and let the water sit for 30 seconds. Pour the remaining water to make your coffee.You may have to add water incrementally to prevent the dripper from overflowing.

, There are many ways to drink coffee. Some people like it with milk or cream, some like it with sugar, and some like it with both. Other people prefer coffee black, which means with nothing added.

Avoid quitting all caffeine abruptly.,
Dilute your coffee with water or extra milk.,
Drink something else in place of coffee -- from tea the coffee substitute Teeccino.At the very least, keep a water bottle nearby so that you always have something to sip on.,
Don't buy coffee.,
Keep the benefits of a smaller coffee diet in the front of your mind.",How to Cut Down on Coffee Consumption1," The first step in reducing coffee consumption is understanding that caffeine is habit-forming and cannot be dropped ""cold turkey."" If you currently drink four cups of coffee per day, for example, make plans to gradually cut that to three, and then two, and so on. Caffeine withdrawal isn't serious, but it isn't fun either, leading to headaches, crankiness, and tiredness for 1-2 weeks.Set goals for the future, such as, ""I want to drink two less cups of coffee a week by next month."" This makes your quest to cut caffeine much more specific and attainable.If you have headaches, use acetaminophen to temporarily stave off the effects of caffeine withdrawal. Aspirin and ibuprofen can both exacerbate acid reflux caused by coffee.;
, An easy and gradual way to begin cutting down coffee consumption is by adding hot water to your coffee. This will allow you to drink the same number of cups per day, so you won't be subjected to the stress of a sudden change in habit. If the watered down taste isn't any good for you, leave more room for milk or cream to get the same effect.


You can begin by filling your cup 3/4 full with coffee and then topping it off with water, and eventually move to an even mixture of coffee and water.
This works at coffee shops, too. You simply have to ask for your coffee to be diluted.
Have you coffee iced, with plenty of ice cubes, ""add water"" easily.

, Oftentimes, the desire to drink coffee just comes from wanting to hold something and sip while working, a desire you can head off with any other drink. From hot teas with lower caffeine levels to fruit juices, don't just eliminate the coffee from your life -- replace it.


If you want to quit coffee because of acid reflux or digestion problems, stay away from lemony and other acidic drinks. Try out ginger, chamomile, green, or other soothing teas.
Switch to half-caf or decaf coffee if caffeine is your worry. This can also be done gradually, by filling a cup 3/4 full with regular coffee and 1/4 full with decaf and then increasing the proportion of decaf from there.

, If you don't have beans in your house, you can't make a cup of coffee. If you don't ever walk into the cafe, you can't order a latte. One of the best ways to defeat temptation is to eliminate the opportunity to be tempted. If you stop buying coffee, or simply buy less than you normal would for the week, you will have no choice to cut back on consumption., You're not doing this for nothing, and cutting your coffee habit back has a host of potential benefits. Use these reasons for motivation, or come up with your own. What is your personal reason to cut back on coffee consumption? Once you know the principle, it is much easier to stick to it. Some good reasons include:


Saving money on drinks
Lower blood pressure
Cleaner teeth and fresher breath
Weight loss (if drinking lattes and other mixed coffee drinks)
Lower anxiety
Fewer trips to the bathroom."
"
Pick dark or medium roast coffee.,
Buy organic coffee.,
Consider switching to decaf.",How to Get Health Benefits from Coffee1," Dark roast coffees have higher levels of healthy antioxidants than lighter roast coffees.These antioxidants have been shown to help prevent weight gain and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. Medium roast coffees also have some similar antioxidant qualities and health benefits.There is some evidence that extremely dark roast coffees lose some of their antioxidant health benefits.
Avoid light roast coffees which have lower levels of antioxidants.;
, Like most commercially grown plant products, coffee beans tend to be heavily sprayed with herbicides and pesticides. Toxins in these applications can cause significant health problems. To avoid these toxins, purchase organically grown coffees that have not been treated with harmful chemicals.Most coffees will have a label on their packaging to let your know if they are organic.

, If you suffer from acid reflux, insomnia, or osteoporosis, you may want to drink decaffeinated coffee. Caffeine can intensify acid reflux and make sleeping more difficult. There is also some evidence that it can lead to calcium loss and fractures.If you experience any of these medical conditions, consult your doctor.

Pour the water and brew the coffee.,
Plunge and pour.",How to Make a Coffee2," To make French press coffee, you just need a French press and a kettle or saucepan to heat the water. Bring the water to a boil, ideally between 195 and 205 F (90.5 and 96 C).


Use enough water for your cup of coffee, plus a little extra in case any is lost to evaporation in the boiling process.

, Measure your grounds and place them into the bottom of the carafe. You don’t need a separate coffee filter to make French press coffee, because there's a mesh filter built into the plunger.


Use coarsely ground coffee grounds for French press coffee. They should be the size of breadcrumbs., When the kettle boils, let it rest for 30 seconds. Pour about an inch (2.5 cm) of water over the grounds and let them bloom for 30 seconds to a minute.


Stir the mixture to break up any clumps, then pour the remaining water.
Place the lid on the press and let the coffee brew for four minutes., To filter the grounds from the coffee, press down on the plunger that’s built into the lid. Press it all the way down to the bottom of the carafe to trap the grounds below the liquid.


Pour your coffee into a mug and serve as desired.

Add the water.,
Add the coffee grounds.,
Insert the coffee pot.,
Turn on the coffeemaker.,
Enjoy your coffee.",How to Make a Coffee3," Lift the lid on the top of the coffee maker. In the back section, there should be a reservoir for the water. Measure out cold water and pour it into the reservoir.


Coffeemakers, like the pour over method, work through a process called percolation. In a coffee maker, the water is boiled in the reservoir, it then flows up to where the coffee grounds are, and then it drips through the grounds to make coffee., Fit the filter basket with a disposable or reusable filter that’s designed to fit that machine. Measure out the coffee grounds and place them into the filter. Use a medium grind for drip coffee.Some coffeemakers have a filter basket that swings out from its position above the dripper. If that’s the case with your coffeemaker, replace the filter basket to its proper position inside the coffeemaker.
Once you’ve added the water, filter, and coffee grounds, close the lid on the coffeemaker.

, After the water boils and drips down through the coffee grounds, the coffee will drain into the pot below the filter. Position the coffee pot onto the warming plate of the coffeemaker, below where the filter and grounds are sitting.


The warming plate heats up when the coffeemaker is turned on, and this will keep the coffee warm long after the water has boiled in the reservoir.

, Once you turn on the coffeemaker, you may have to press a Start button to activate the process. Other coffeemakers are simpler, and will begin to brew as soon as you turn it on.


The coffeemaker will take about five to eight minutes to brew a pot of coffee.

, The coffeemaker is finished when the coffee stops dripping into the pot. Transfer the coffee to a mug and enjoy it with milk, cream, sugar, syrup, or any other way you like it.


Keep the coffeemaker in the On position to keep any leftover coffee warm.
Remove the filter from the basket immediately, otherwise excess water could drip into the coffee pot and make the leftover coffee bitter."

Combine the cold water and coffee.,
Add the hot water and enjoy.",How to Make a Coffee4," Measure out 6 to 8 ounces (177 to 23 ml) of water and bring it to a boil in either a kettle or a saucepan over medium heat. The ideal water temperature for making coffee is about 200 F (93 C).

, In a coffee mug, stir together the instant coffee granules and cold water. Set the mug aside to let the coffee dissolve as the water boils.


Mixing the coffee with cold water first helps the granules dissolve more slowly, and this creates a more flavorful cup of coffee that doesn’t taste like instant., When the water boils, add it to your mug of dissolved instant coffee. Stir to combine the water and coffee, and add your favorite coffee fixings before serving.

This style of coffee is made the same way you make bag tea, but instead you make your own coffee bag using a disposable filter.

, Measure out your coffee grounds and place them in the center of a disposable coffee filter. Wrap the coffee filter around the coffee and twist the excess filter closed to create a pouch. Tie the filter tightly with a small piece of string or twine.When the coffee bag is ready, place it into a coffee mug.

, Boil your water in a kettle or saucepan. When it’s around 200 F (93 C), pour the water over the coffee bag in the mug. Let the coffee steep for about four minutes.As the coffee steeps, the grounds will release their flavors and turn the hot water into freshly brewed coffee.

, With a spoon, carefully remove the coffee bag from the mug. Allow the excess water to drip out. Add milk, sugar, or other ingredients and enjoy your coffee.

Keep consistency in your meal times and coffee consumption to eliminate ""treats."",
Up your exercise regiment, as it produces similar stimulating feelings as coffee.,
Get more sleep.,
Substitute healthier drinks for coffee, making them part of your routine.,
Ensure that your diet is balanced.,
Set your personal coffee limit and stick to it.",How to Cut Down on Coffee Consumption2," If you have coffee with breakfast first thing in the morning, it is much easier to contain your coffee drinking to this one time. However, if you skip breakfast every few days or sleep in often, you start telling your body that coffee is okay -- and desirable -- at any time in the day. Keeping your coffee drinking to a routine is a great way to easily cut back on consumption.Hungry people tend to get both tired and cranky, and a cup of coffee seems like the easiest fix. Avoid the temptation by staying well-fed.

, Regular exercise increases blood circulation, wakes up your body and mind, and has long term physical and mental health effects that can't be overstated. Instead of reaching for a cup of afternoon joe, head out for a walk or bike ride. You'll earn a lot more than a smaller coffee bill., Caffeine is a temporary solution to a larger problem -- you're simply too tired. Instead of trying to fight the urge to sleep with coffee, recognize that a better, more consistent sleep-cycle is the best thing you can do for your mental and physical health. This means trying to go to bed at the same hour every night, getting up at similar times, and avoiding the cycle of late nights and heavy oversleeping on the weekends.Caffeine stays in your system for hours, meaning a late-afternoon coffee will adversely affect your sleep quality. Keep coffee consumption before 1-2PM at the latest. Effects can last up to 8 hours, meaning your sleep will be hurt., If coffee drinking has become a habit for you, you need to recognize your body's very real need to constantly sip on a nearby beverage. Having healthier beverages available is similar to the smoker's trick of reducing the need for handling cigarettes by keeping carrot or celery sticks on hand.


The most sensible substitute is water. Sipping water throughout the day will not only satisfy your need for having a beverage at hand, but will also make you feel better in general, which will further reduce your perceived need for coffee.This technique is also instrumental in weening yourself from large caffeine intakes. Black tea is stimulating but provides less caffeine than coffee. Green and white teas provide even less caffeine, while herbal teas provide none at all., For many coffee consumers, caffeine is a crutch used to escape the crashes caused by a carbohydrate-heavy diet. If your diet is heavy in carbohydrates (including starches and refined sugars), you will tend to experience more dramatic highs and lows that you may attempt to ""correct"" by drinking coffee. To help you reduce the need for caffeine, make sure that each meal you eat provides carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Getting your calories from balanced sources will have a dramatic impact on your perceived need for coffee consumption.This problem is especially important during working hours, when many people have access primarily to sugary snacks from office vending machines. Packing your own healthy snacks is helpful in this setting.

, Saying you want to cut down on coffee is a great first step, but it isn't the only one. Make a measurable goal for yourself and it will be much easier to stick to, like only 1 coffee a day, no coffee after noon, or only visiting the nearby cafe on the weekends. Vague, larger goals like ""cutting down"" are hard to stick by. Specific, measurable goals are much easier to get down.


These goals can change, of course. You might start by saying ""no coffee after noon"" for the first two weeks, then gradually eliminate 1-2 cups a week as your body gets used to less coffee."

Store the coffee in an airtight container.,
Grind your own beans.,
Think about brewing your coffee in an espresso or Neapolitan-style pot.,
Use a steel or gold filter.,
Avoid paper filters.",How to Get Health Benefits from Coffee2," Roasted coffee beans contain unhealthy free radicals that can cause damage at the cellular level. These free radicals increase the longer the beans are exposed to air. To prevent the proliferation of free radicals, store your beans in an airtight container like a freezer bag., Waiting to grind your beans until you brew your coffee will also limit the development of free radicals. Ground coffee exposes more of the beans surface area to the air, promoting oxidation and the growth of free radicals. Waiting to grind your beans also ensures the high antioxidant content of your coffee.Buy whole beans and use a commercial grinder each time you brew coffee.

, There is some debate about the healthiest means of brewing coffee. Coffee brewed in an espresso or Neapolitan-style pot may have more than twice the antioxidant levels of coffee percolated through paper filters.However, these brewing methods may lead to increase cholesterol levels in your blood., Metal filters made from steel or gold can filter out harmful elements that may cause cardiovascular problems. They also allow for the flow of antioxidants that have significant health benefits.However, these filters can be expensive and require more maintenance than paper filters.

, Percolating coffee through a paper filter may limit the amount of harmful cholesterol in your blood stream.However, studies have also shown that it can increase cholesterol and the likelihood of cardiovascular problems.Bleached paper filters also contain toxins that can be harmful if ingested in large quantities. There is also some evidence that using paper filters may limit the amount of antioxidants in your coffee.If you have to use paper filters, use brown, unbleached filters.

Skip the sweeteners.,
Avoid low-fat and artificial creamers.,
Add some full-fat cream.,
Sprinkle some cocoa or cinnamon in your coffee.",How to Get Health Benefits from Coffee3," In order to receive its full health benefits, avoid adding any sugar or artificial sweeteners to your cup of coffee. Sugars can lead to a number of different health issues, ranging from obesity to diabetes and heart disease. To get the most from your coffee, drink it black.If you need some sugar to cut the coffee’s bitterness, consider using a sparing amount of Stevia.
Most sugary coffee drinks, like mochas and lattes, contain between 200 and 500 calories.

, These products tend to be heavily processed and full of ingredients that can be harmful. Many contain high fructose corn syrup and trans fats that can lead to diabetes and heart disease. You should be particularly careful to avoid any creamers that also contain sweeteners. These can give you the unhealthy double whammy of bad fats and high sugar., Consider pouring some full-fat cream or whole milk into your coffee. If eaten in moderation, high-fat products are less likely to cause obesity and cardiovascular issues.You should also look for full-fat products from grass-fed cows. These tend to have better nutritional benefits when compared to products from grain-fed cattle.

, Cocoa is high in antioxidants and helps promote cardiovascular health.Cinnamon has been shown to have some heart-healthy qualities, particularly for people suffering from type 2 diabetes.Besides aiding your health, these two products will also add some flavor to your coffee and help limit its bitterness.

For a good cup of chai, buy chai from a high quality tea brand.;
, Full fat milk gives the chai a nice creaminess. But you can also use low fat, skim, powdered, or condensed sweetened milk.If you decide to use condensed sweetened milk, dilute it first with several tablespoons of water.

, Traditionally, you use a mortar and pestle to grind up the pods into a fine powder.If you don’t have access to a mortar and pestle, you can use a bowl and a flat headed spoon to grind up the cardamon. But it will be more difficult to grind them up this way.

, Use a fine grater to grate the ginger.


Grating the ginger will create a stronger ginger flavor to the tea.
You can also mince the ginger or cut it into thin strips. This will create a lighter ginger flavor to the tea.

, Now, some chai makers put the water in the saucepan first and let the tea steep in the water. Other chai makers put the milk in first and let the tea steep in the milk.


For the sake of this example, we are going to start with the water first. If you would like a richer, creamier chai, try starting with the milk first., Then, add in the tea bags or the loose tea. For two cups of chai, use 2 tea bags or 2 teaspoons of loose tea., Then, turn the heat up to boiling.Let the ingredients boil for 3-4 minutes on high heat.

, Once the tea has boiled for 3-4 minutes and has turned a nice brown color, add the milk.

, Stir the tea to combine the milk with the tea.


If you like your chai tea very strong, you can place the saucepan back on the heat and brew it for a few more minutes., Place the strainer on the top of the cup. Hold the handle of the saucepan (and likely an oven mitt as the handle will be hot) and pour the tea into the strainer.Fill the two cups and enjoy your Bombay chai tea with a bun maska' (traditional Indian bread and butter)or your favorite cookie.

, In addition to the ingredients used in a traditional Bombay tea, a masala chai also contains:A small dash of cinnamon
3 cloves
A teaspoon of SOANP, which are small seeds that look like cumin seeds that can be found at an Indian grocery store.
Masala translates to ""spicy"", so masala is known as a chai tea with more spice and flavor than a traditional cup of Bombay tea.

, Then, add in all the ingredients to the water, including the cinnamon, the three cloves and the teaspoon of SOANP.


Do not add milk to the masala at this point, just the other ingredients.

, Stir the masala to combine the ingredients as it boils.


Warm the milk in a separate pot as the masala boils.

, Then, add the milk and sugar. Adjust the sweetness of the masala according to your preference.

Chill your coffee and serve when ready.",How to Cold Brew Coffee," The best coffee comes from beans that have been recently roasted, so try to get beans that have been roasted locally. If you can't find local beans, just find a coffee bean that you have enjoyed in the past.


If you have a grinder, buy coffee beans that have not been ground yet. Grinding your own will give you fresher and better tasting cold brew coffee.;
, This can be a pitcher, a large jar, or your french press coffee maker, with the presser taken out.


To avoid flavors or chemicals leaching into your coffee, try to find a container that is made of glass. Glass will not react with the coffee and will not leach any chemicals into it either.
There are some specialty products that are made specifically for brewing cold brew coffee. If you want to make a lot of cold brew and you like gadgets, consider investing in one of these systems., You will want to grind about one ounce of coffee for every one cup of water you will use. Determine how many cups of water your container can hold and then use that many ounces of coffee.


If you like really strong cold brew, use more coffee per cup of water. It's up to you, so experiment with the ration to find one you like!
There is some debate about what grind to use. Some experts say that you want medium to course ground coffee beans as opposed to finely ground. This is because it makes for a slower, longer extraction of the coffee flavor into the water.Others advocate for a finely ground coffee, as you will get more extraction out of the beans.Since opinions vary, try grinding your beans both ways and figure out which you like better.

, Remember, you want to stick to a specific ratio of one cup of water to every ounce of coffee beans. So if your container holds six cups of water, you should put six ounces of coffee grounds into it.









Once the grounds have been in the water for about ten minutes, stir the grounds in the water.This will make sure that you are getting full extraction of flavor from all of the grounds.

, Allow the coffee to steep for 12 - 24 hours, depending on how strong you want your cold brewed coffee.You can occasionally stir the mixture while it is steeping to ensure even saturation of coffee grounds.
Some recommend placing your coffee mixture into the refrigerator. While this is not necessary, as the coffee will not spoil at room temperature, it will result in a colder cold brew when the process is finished.

, You can filter the mixture several different ways. A simple way is to put a wire mesh strainer with a piece of cheesecloth or a large coffee filter in it over a pitcher. Then simply pour the steeped coffee through it. The goal is to get rid of all of the coffee grounds, leaving you with a smooth and delicious cold brew.









If you are using a french press, place the plunger on your press and gently press it down until all coffee grounds are at the bottom of the french press.
If after your first filter you still have some grounds in the coffee, run the coffee through a filter a second time.
After all the brewed coffee is poured out, there will be left over grounds at the bottom of the container. Do not pour these excess grounds into the filter. They will not add anything to your finished product.

, You now have have a non-diluted iced coffee drink to enjoy with ice, milk or cream, and the sweetener of your choice.









Consider making some simple syrup to add to your cold brewed coffee.Unlike regular sugar, which will not dissolve in cold coffee, simple syrup will combine with the cold brew nicely.
Cold brewed coffee can be kept in your fridge for several weeks, just keep it covered. Unlike hot-brewed coffee, cold-brewed coffee will not become stale over time."

Avoid drinking coffee in the afternoon or evening.,
Stay hydrated.,
Limit how much coffee you drink.",How to Get Health Benefits from Coffee4," Drinking caffeinated drinks too late in the day can disrupt your sleep and lead to disorders like insomnia. Ideally, you should avoid drinking any caffeinated or sugary drinks at least six hours before you go to sleep. This ensures that the caffeine has worked its way out of your system.Consider tapering off your caffeine consumption over the course of your day. Start with coffee in the morning and then switch to tea or decaffeinated drinks in the afternoon.
As a rule of thumb, try not to drink any caffeine after 2pm.

, Caffeinated drinks like coffee have a mild diuretic effect, which causes you to urinate more frequently. Although drinking a cup or two of coffee does not significantly dehydrate you, drinking coffee throughout the day without any water can lead to dehydration. Make sure that you accompany your coffee drinking with at least a half-gallon (2 L) of water over the course of the day., When you brew yourself coffee or buy a drink from your local barista, stick with a smaller sized option. Many coffee drinkers consume more caffeine than is healthy, which can lead to sleep disorders and heart problems. When you get a cup of coffee, make sure that you limit yourself to a simple 8-ounce (237 mL) cup.This will also help you limit the amount of sugar and saturated fat the you consume with your coffee as well.

Go for sugar-free flavorings.,
Skip the whipped cream.,
Be wary of how much sugar you add.,

Add in flavorings.",How to Choose Healthier Coffee House Drinks," One of the easiest ways to cut down on the total calorie, fat and sugar content is by choosing a smaller size. Although you may feel like you need a larger dose of caffeine, stick to small sizes to manage the calories in your coffee drink.Most coffee shops will have at least three sizes of coffees — small, medium and large. The calorie differences between the sizes can range from just a few calories to over 100 calories.Stick to a small or medium coffee drink for the lowest calories, fat and sugar. If you don't want to order a drink with lower fat milk or sugar-free flavorings, definitely stick to a smaller size.
However, if you're only drinking black coffee there's no reason to order a small, as calories won't change in black coffee.
In addition, some coffee shops have a size that's smaller than their small — it may be labeled as a kid's drink or child's size, but is a great option if you want to indulge in a higher calorie treat.;
, If you're choosing a mixed coffee drink, they will generally be mixed with some milk or milk substitute. This can be a great source of added nutrients, but also a source of more calories and fat.


Many coffee shops will offer you skim, 2% milk, whole milk, almond milk and even coconut milk.6 oz of skim or nonfat milk has 60 calories. The same amount of soy milk contains 92 calories, almond milk has about 45 calories, 2% milk has 84 calories, and full-fat has 102 calories.
Although coffee drinks made with milk are higher in calories, they are also higher in some nutrients. Milk provides you with a good source of calcium, protein and Vitamin D., Add in spices instead of syrups. In addition to the milk, one of the biggest sources of extra calories and sugar in coffee drinks is the flavorings. They may be from syrups, mixes or just plain sugar. Try ordering coffee drinks with minimal added sugars for a healthier drink.


Since sticking to a lower calorie diet or a low-carb diet is popular, many coffee shops will offer the option to have sugar-free syrups, mixes or coffees. Order the sugar-free flavorings whenever possible.Look for coffee drinks labeled as sugar-free or ""skinny,"" as these typically indicate that the flavorings are sugar-free and the overall drink is lower in calories compared to the regular version.
If you do go for the sugar-free versions, note that these will contain artificial sweeteners. If you want to avoid these types of sweeteners choose a small or kid's sized beverage with the regular syrups.
You can also request the barista use a reduce the usual amount of these ingredients — for instance, you could ask for only one pump of syrup instead of the regular four.

, Some coffee drinks have the option of having whipped cream added on top. If you want to drink a healthier coffee, go without the whipped cream.


If you get the whipped cream on your drink, you're adding about 80 calories to your total for that beverage.Even if you order a small or kid's sized beverage, the amount of whipped cream will be about the same amount, so you're not saving calories that way.
Be careful when ordering mixed coffee drinks. Many items automatically come with whipped cream unless you specify. So make sure to always say ""without whipped cream."" Or, order a sugar-free or ""skinny"" version as these do not come with whipped cream.

, You may think you're making a better choice by ordering a plain coffee and doctoring it up yourself. Be careful with what you add to your coffee so you stick to the healthiest coffee drink.


If you just stick to a plain cup of black coffee without anything in it, you're pretty much going with a calorie-free beverage.
If you want to add a little sweetener to your drink you can either go with regular sugar or sugar in the raw or any of the artificial sweeteners provided.
If you choose artificial sweeteners, you'll stick with a calorie-free beverage as they do not contain any calories. If you go with regular sugar or sugar in the raw, it'll only add a 11 calories per sugar packet.Choose wisely about the type of sugar you add to your own drinks. Adding one packet of regular sugar isn't going to add that many calories; however, if you add more than one or drink several cups of coffee per day, that can add up to many more calories and grams of sugar than you'd think. Consider limiting how many cups or how much sugar you add to cut down on overall calories.

, One of the lowest calorie drinks you can order at a coffee shop is an americano. It's a low-calorie drink that's fairly simple and is a better choice than many.

An americano is a shot of espresso topped off with some hot water. There is no milk, added sugars or flavorings in this beverage.Compared to other coffee drinks, this is probably one of the lowest in calories. A small typically only has about 11 calories per drink.Since this drink doesn't have added sugars or milk, you may consider adding some yourself. Choose wisely between regular sugar or sugar substitutes. If you want to maintain the lower calorie, sugar-free nature of the drink, go with a sugar substitute.

, An americano may be a little bland for some people. If you want to have something with a little creaminess, try ordering a plain cappuccino or latte instead.


A plain cappuccino is a shot of espresso mixed with a little steamed milk and foam. A latte is espresso mixed with much more milk with very little foam.When ordering a plain version of these drinks, you're foregoing the flavorings which can rack up added calories and sugar. A small version of these drinks typically range from 90 – 150 calories per drink.Keep calories in mind when choosing your milk.
Again, since these drinks do not come with added sugar, be you may want to add some sweetness. Choose between artificial sweeteners or regular sugar depending on what your overall calorie goal is.

, Another popular type of coffee house drink is the chai tea latte. You get the best of both worlds — a bit of caffeine from the tea (chai has about 1/3 the amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee)and a flavorful drink from the spicy flavor of chai.


Most chai tea lattes are made from hot steamed milk mixed with a chai tea concentrate.The chai tea concentrate, although very tasty, does contain added sugars so calories can begin to rise if you're ordering a large size or ordering with whole milk.Stick with a small chai tea latte made with skim milk for the lowest calorie blend. It typically only has about 100 calories per drink., Another favorite coffee shop beverage is the peppermint mocha. A sweet hint of chocolate mixed with refreshing peppermint. Order carefully when indulging in this chocolate coffee drink.


A peppermint mocha is traditionally made from combining a shot of espresso with steamed milk, peppermint syrup and a squeeze of chocolate syrup.When you order a small made with skim milk and no whipped cream, this fancy drink will only cost you about 150 calories., Although stopping by a coffee shop each morning may be part of your routine, if your favorite coffee is affecting your waistline (or wallet), consider making your own drinks at home.To start making healthier versions at home, you'll need to purchase a coffee maker. You can either purchase a traditional multi-cup coffee maker or an espresso machine. Most coffee shop drinks are made with espresso, so you might choose this instead.
You may want to purchase a machine that allows you to make a single shot of espresso. These generally require you to buy individual pods of espresso so you can make one individual shot.
You can also go with a more traditional espresso machine where you buy the coffee beans, pack it into the machine and brew your espresso. These are a little more time intensive, but give you great espresso., The main ingredient in coffee house drinks is the coffee. You'll need to start by brewing up coffee or espresso to make your own homemade coffee house drink.


Espresso machines, even the small individual brewers, can get expensive; however, you can brew regular coffee and make it really strong for a similar flavor to espresso.
For cappuccinos and lattes, you need to make at least 1/3 of your total drink volume coffee. Fill your cup about 1/3 of the way up.
If you make a large quantity of espresso or strong coffee, consider keeping it the refrigerator so you can have it ready to go for the next day.

, The next most important ingredient in your coffee house drink is the milk. Depending on what type of drink you're making, the amount and temperature of the milk will vary.


For hot coffee drinks like lattes and cappuccinos, you'll need to heat your milk. Lattes are made with 1/3 coffee and 2/3 milk. Heating your milk over the stove or in the microwave will work.
Cappuccinos are 1/3 coffee, 1/3 milk and 1/3 foam. The only way to get foam is by using a milk frother or putting your warmed milk in a blender. Pour in the milk followed by your desired amount of foam.
If you want an iced or cold drink, skip the heating process and just measure out the same amount of milk. Choose skim milk or unsweetened almond milk for the lowest calorie option., Lastly, you'll need to add any of your favorite flavorings to your coffee drink. To truly mimic those coffee house beverages (especially around the holidays), you'll need to add a few of those signature syrups or spices.


Many of the traditional coffee drinks use flavored syrups. These are actually easy to find in many stores (from grocery stores to gourmet stores) and online. Plus, they are available in larger and smaller sizes and come in sugar-free for your convenience.
If you're going to use a syrup, you'll need to add the appropriate amount of syrup to your drink. This will be completely up to you and how sweet you like your drinks. Start with one or two ""squirts"" and taste to see if you need to add more.
Some coffee house drinks also use some spices — whether it's a sprinkle of cinnamon or vanilla sugar. Stick with a sprinkle of cinnamon, nutmeg or even pumpkin pie spice for a calorie-free flavor booster.

Identify the source of the powder.",How to Identify Quality Matcha Tea Powder," A good quality organic matcha tea powder is vibrant green in color. Inferior quality matcha powder is somewhat yellowish green or army green in hue and even after whisking, it remains the same.
, A high grade is smooth, silky and finely textured, while the low-quality powders are rough and harsh in texture., Good quality powder has a natural, vegetal, sweet taste, while an inferior quality is identified with a more bitter taste., Good quality matcha powder should smell sweet due to being rich in amino acids and astringent.These elements are not present in lower quality matcha powder., Low-quality matcha will not properly froth, whereas good quality matcha powder can be properly whisked into a uniform consistency without any lumps., To ensure that you are purchasing good quality organic matcha green tea powder, check the direct source or origin. The best quality of matcha is produced and processed in Japan, especially in the Kyoto, Uji and Nishio regions."

Get a chaser.,
Tilt your head back.,
Breathe through your mouth.,
Swallow the shot immediately.",How to Take a Shot of Liquor1," A chaser is a drink that you can use to decrease the taste of the shot. Get a soda, juice, or beer to take with your shot. You will take a sip of the chaser right after you down the shot to remove the taste of the liquor from your tongue. Make sure you have your chaser ready before you take your shot.


You can also take a small sip of the chaser before you take your shot and hold it in your mouth. Drink the shot, and then swallow the chaser and the shot at the same time. Once you have swallowed, take another sip of the chaser.
Depending on the shot (i.e. tequila) you are taking, you may need to get your lemon, lime, or salt ready before you take the shot.
Beer is the most commonly used chaser. Tequila can be chased with a light lager such as Tecate, Corona, or Pacifico. Bourbon pairs well with an imperial stout beer.Chase with any beer that you like or ask the bartender for a suggestion.
If you are drinking whiskey, try using pickle juice as a chaser.;
, Slightly tilt your head as you raise the shot glass to your mouth. Continue tilting your head and the shot glass at the same time as you drink the liquor. The shot glass should be upside-down when you are finished taking the shot. This motion will make it easier for you to get the shot down your throat.Be careful not to tilt your head too far back. You do not want to choke on the liquor.
Make sure you tilt both your head and the shot glass. Titling only one of these can result in a mess. For example, if you tilt the glass but do not tilt your head back, you may spill the shot on your clothes.

, Inhale right before you open your mouth to take the shot. Do not exhale before you drink the liquor.Exhaling before you take the shot may cause you to gag on the shot. Once you have finished the shot, exhale out of your mouth again.


Avoid breathing through your nose during the shot taking process. Breathing through your nose intensifies the taste of the shot.Remember to inhale before you take the shot. Inhaling while you take the shot will cause you to inhale fumes and cough.

, Shots are not meant to be sipped.Holding the liquor in your mouth will make it more difficult for you to swallow the shot or activate your gag reflex. You will also taste the liquor much more if you do not swallow it immediately.


Prolonging the shot can also cause the liquor to go down the wrong pipe.
Keep your jaw and your throat relaxed as you swallow.

Choose your liquor.,
Measure your shot.,
Make it a social experience.",How to Take a Shot of Liquor2," You have many different options for taking a shot. Most shots are taken with an 80 proof (40% alcohol content) liquor such as rum, whiskey, tequila, vodka, or gin.If you are trying to avoid having a hangover the next day, choose a clear liquor like vodka, gin, or some tequilas.Dark liquors (e.g. rum, whiskey, bourbon) contain larger amounts of congeners. The increased amount of these congeners can make you have a more severe hangover.Dark liquors tend to have a stronger flavor compared to light liquors. If you do not have a preference, you may want to take a shot of a clear liquor.

, A typical shot in the United States is 1.5 ounces, but shot glasses come in various sizes. If you are ordering your drink at a bar, ask for a single shot. A double shot at a bar is typically 2 ounces. If you are preparing the shot yourself, use measuring spoons. Three tablespoons or nine teaspoons is equivalent to a 1.5 ounce shot.If you do not have measuring spoons, you can use a Solo brand cup. The bottom line of the Solo cup is 1 ounce.
A small medicine cup that comes with a bottle of cough syrup can also be used. These cups are usually 1 or 2 ounces and have measurement lines on them.

, Taking a shot is more enjoyable when you do it with other people. If you are taking a shot with your friends, order all of the shots at once and wait until everyone has their shot before you take it. If you are at a bar alone, ask if anyone wants to take a shot with you. The bartender may even take a shot with you.


Make a toast and have everyone raise their glasses.
If you are drinking with other people, do not feel pressure to drink as much as they do or pressure others to drink more.

"
"
Eat before you drink.,
Have a designated driver.,
Pace yourself.,
Do not exceed the daily limits.",How to Take a Shot of Liquor3," Eating a meal before you begin to drink will cause your body to absorb the alcohol more slowly. Be sure you eat some real food and not just snacks (e.g. chips, dip, pretzels, etc.).High protein foods (e.g. meat, cheese, peanuts) are particularly good to eat when you are drinking.Alcohol causes you to become dehydrated. Avoid eating salty food while drinking., Before you leave your house, make sure you have a designated driver for the evening. If you do not have a driver, call a taxi or use a service like Uber or Lyft to get home safely. If you are drinking with friends, spend the night at your friend's house instead of driving home. If you notice that someone else has had too much to drink, figure out a way for the person to get home safely.Alcohol slows down your reaction time, changes your vision, and makes it more difficult for you to process information.This increases your chances of getting into a wreck when you are driving.
If you plan to drive home, have a drink with your meal and do not consume more than one glass of wine, beer, mixed drink, or shot in an hour.Again, it is best not to drink if you plan to drive.

, Your body does not immediately respond to alcohol. When you drink too fast, your body does not have a chance to catch up.For example, if you take three shots back to back, you may feel fine initially and then become lightheaded when you walk to the bathroom 30 minutes later.


Try not to have more than one drink (i.e. 5 ounces of wine, 12 ounces or beer, one mixed drink, or 1.5 ounces of hard liquor) per hour.
Alternating drinks is another method you can use to pace yourself. Drink one cup of water or non-alcoholic beverage, for every alcoholic drink that you have.

, Women should not drink more than one drink per day and men should not drink more than two drinks per day. A single drink is 12 ounces of beer, 8 ounces of malt liquor, 5 ounces of wine, or 1.5 ounces of liquor. You should also avoid binge drinking. Binge drinking is drinking 5 or more drinks on a single occasion if you are a man and drinking 4 or more drinks on a single occasion if you are a woman.If you or anyone you know has a drinking problem call 1-800-662-HELP to get some help.
Excessive drinking is associated with many health problems including cancer, high blood pressure, and unintentional injuries.
If you are pregnant, do not drink. Alcohol can be harmful to your fetus.

Suitable herbs to add to ice cubes include mint leaves, thyme leaves, borage flowers and basil leaves. Just be sure to add the cubes to drinks that will work nicely with floating plant life!;
, This is a great way to add a fun element to the cocktail drinks. Freeze a whole olive or cocktail cherry (pits removed) inside an ice cube. When the cube melts, the fruit will bob around the drink, begging to be eaten.

, Seeing an edible flower inside an ice cube is like a miniature work of art and it won't spoil the drink. Choose such flowers as flowering herbs (thyme, oregano, borage, etc.), small rose buds or miniature roses, nasturtium petals or violets. Whatever flower you choose, be sure that it's totally edible.

, Small pieces of fruit are often an ideal addition to a cocktail, fruit juice drink or similar sweet drink. Suitable additions include strawberries, raspberries, chopped orange/lime/lemon, mango pieces, blueberries, etc. Many sorts of fruit will work well and can be purposefully matched to the intended drink's flavor.


Some fruits will turn brown when exposed to air, and some will turn brown when frozen, so do a test run first.

, Instead of using water, use a soft drink or similar flavored liquid to make the ice cubes. In some cases, this will not only improve the flavor but will also add color. Just be sure that the flavor combination works for the drinks you're adding the cubes to. Some examples include:


Kool Aid ice cubes
Soft drink ice cubes

Juice cubes.

, Imagine that––chocolate ice cubes! Well, they're actually really tasty. You can either make the entire ice cube from chocolate liquid (such as chocolate milk), or you can break off pieces of dark, high quality chocolate and toss it inside. Suitable for drinks that are already on the chocolatey side.


For more information, see How to make chocolate ice cubes.

, Colored ice cubes can look amazing inside some drinks, especially if you aim to color coordinate their arrangement. Colored cubes are as easy as adding a small drop of food coloring to the water for each cube before freezing. Either use one single color or mix it up with various different colors, as you like.


When serving, layering crushed colored ice can be exceptionally effective.

When the juice has been removed, use your knife to carefully peel the outer layer of zest from each fruit half. Set these aside and discard what's left of the fruit.

, In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, cream of tartar, and 1 cup (237 ml) of the water. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, stirring often. Once it’s boiling, continue simmering for 20 minutes.


After 20 minutes, remove the pan from the heat and set the syrup aside to cool.

, Boil the remaining cup (237 ml) of water in a kettle. Transfer the boiling water to a heat-safe bowl and add the zest from the lemon, lime, and orange. Cover the bowl with a towel and set it aside to steep.


Let the citrus peels infuse into the water for one to two hours, until the water returns to room temperature.

, When the citrus water has cooled, strain out the peels and reserve the water. Add the syrup and citrus juices to the citrus-infused water and stir to combine.


Although this homemade mixture isn't the same color as Mountain Dew, it will have a similar citrus flavor. You can add some green and yellow food coloring if you want the soda to be a similar color.

, There are several ways to carbonate drinks at home. The simplest method is adding carbonated water, which you can either buy at the store or make yourself with a home carbonation machine.

Once chilled, pour the whipping cream into the bowl and beat on medium speed until stiff peaks form, about nine minutes.Keep the cream in the refrigerator until it’s time to whip it. It’s important to chill everything before whipping because this will help incorporate air into the cream better.

, Add the sweetened condensed milk to the whipped cream and gently fold it in with a rubber spatula. Once that is fully incorporated, add the Mountain Dew and gently fold it in.


Folding is a baking technique used to combine ingredients with different densities.
To fold ingredients into the whipped cream, use the rubber spatula to scoop whipped cream from the bottom of the bowl and fold it around the other ingredients. This will protect the air bubbles making the whipped cream light and airy., To start, add five drops of yellow food coloring and two drops of green to the bowl with the ice cream base. Stir to combine. Add more food coloring if necessary, until you achieve the desired level of intensity.You can also play around with the color ratios to achieve a different color. For instance, try adding an extra drop of green, or fewer drops of yellow to the mix.

, Transfer the ice cream base to a freezer-safe bowl. Cover the top with a layer of plastic wrap to protect it from freezer burn. Press the plastic wrap down so it’s almost touching the top of the mixture. Put on the air-tight lid and transfer the mixture to the freezer.


Ideally, let the ice cream chill overnight, or for six to eight hours at least.
When the ice cream is thoroughly chilled, portion it out with an ice cream scoop and enjoy."

Put the bottle in the dishwasher, and run a cycle.,

Serve and enjoy!

",How to Make Peeps Vodka2," For this method, you'll be making a half-bottle of Peeps vodka. This is because you'll be placing the Peeps directly into the vodka bottle, and their marshmallow goodness takes up a lot of room.


Make sure all of your Peeps are the same color — that way, your vodka will be one bright, beautiful color instead of a muddier mix!

, You could do half plain, half Peeps-infused. Or, use the other half for the refrigerator method (above).

, They don't have to be miniature, just small enough for you to get them into the vodka bottle.


For less mess, freeze the Peeps, then cut them into pieces with a slicing knife.







, You might need to use the end of a wooden spoon to push everything into the bottle.


Make sure the Peeps are covered. If you have any room leftover once they're all in, pour back some of the vodka you set aside in Step 2.

, Put the cap back on, making sure to twist it as tightly as possible.

, The hot water will melt the sugary Peeps and speed up the infusion process., When you take the vodka out of the dishwasher, shake it to make sure it's evenly mixed.

, You don't have to do this step — you could simply pour your drinks out of the vodka, and count any marshmallow globs as a garnish. If you would like to strain it, though, here's how:

Pour the vodka into a bowl. If there are some Peeps bits left behind, don't worry!
Rinse out the bottle.
Put a funnel in the bottle. Use a coffee filter or a paper towel for a filter.






Pour the vodka from the bowl into the funnel. Be aware that this process might require more than one filter.

Find a tall, sturdy glass.,

Press the round end of a muddler into the glass and gently twist several times.,
Add 2 jiggers (3 oz or 88 ml) of rum.,
Add four ice cubes and top with club soda.",How to Make a Mojito1," A short glass will make your drink look sloppy and crowded, and a glass with fragile sides may break when you begin muddling.If you are worried about a watered-down drink, you can add more rum later. Just keep in mind this cocktail is a cooler, so it's meant to be sipped over time and not chugged.A pint glass or collins glass work well for Mojitos. Pint glasses are usually a little thicker, but you may prefer the straight cylinder of the collins glass.;
, You should have enough lime juice to completely cover and wet the sugar. Because limes don't all hold the same amount of liquid, 1/2 lime may not be enough. Squeeze in more juice from the remaining half.


Hierba buena (or yerba buena) is the variety of mint used in a traditional Cuban Mojito, but spearmint may be easier to find. You can also try peppermint or pineapple mint.Super fine granulated sugar is the classic sweetener in a Mojito. The granules help open up the mint when you muddle, and a fine sugar dissolves better in liquid than a coarse sugar, like Turbinado.You can also use simple syrup instead of granulated sugar. This will ensure your drink is sweet throughout and there won't be any grit from undissolved sugar., You should stop when the room smells of mint, before the mint begins to tear apart.You're not trying to pulverize the mint--the purpose of muddling is to release the oils in the mint leaves, which only requires a little crumpling or bruising. If you shred your leaves, the veins will release chlorophyll and your Mojito will taste bitter and grassy.You may want to slice the juiced half of the lime into wedges and add it to your drink to be muddled. The peel can add a little extra lime flavor and complexity to the drink. Make sure you don't smash the pith (the white layer between the flesh and the peel)--it's very bitter.If you don't have a muddler, you can use the back of a spoon (wooden, preferably) or the handle of a rolling pin. Muddlers should be made of unvarnished wood (so no resin makes its way into your drinks) and should have a round side and a side with teeth.Unless you are using the hierba buena variety of mint, make sure you do not have any stems in your drink. In spearmint, the flavor is concentrated in the leaves--the stems only contain bitter chlorophyll and can ruin your drink.If you are using hierba buena mint, you'll want to put in two full springs, stem and all. The flavor from the hierba buena comes from the stems, and is more citrusy and herbal than other types of mint., A white Cuban rum will provide the most authentic flavor, but may be difficult to find in some countries. Otherwise, a light (white or silver) rum is a good substitute.If you like your drink a little stronger, add more rum now. This is preferable to using a short glass to make a more concentrated drink, since you can still leisurely sip on your tall Mojito.

, Ice cubes are preferable to crushed ice--crushed ice melts faster (which will make your drink colder) but will water down your beverage.Club soda has a clean and unobtrusive flavor that will not affect the taste of your Mojito.You can mix things up with a lemon-lime flavored soda or a local mineral water.
Garnish with a lime wedge, sprig of mint, or a sugar swizzle stick."

Add mint, sugar, lime juice, and strawberries to a tall, sturdy glass.,
Press the muddler into the glass and twist.,
Add 2 jiggers (3 oz or 88 ml) of rum and stir, blending all your flavors together.,
Add ice cubes and top with club soda.",How to Make a Mojito2," It is especially important you use a tall glass with the strawberry Mojito, since the strawberries add some volume to the cocktail. Make sure you layer your drink in this way, so the mint leaves are protected from the muddler and are less likely to shred.If you're not into the texture of muddled strawberries, you can also puree them in a blender and add with the rum.Your cocktail will be a little smoother, and you can even strain out the little seeds if you want.
Make sure your strawberries are hulled (the stems removed).
Because the strawberries are naturally sweet, you may want to reduce the amount of sugar.(A classic Mojito uses about two teaspoons of sugar, this recipe cuts that in half.)

, If your muddler has an end with spikes on it, you can use that side to crush the strawberries--just make sure the mint leaves are on the very bottom of the glass so they don't tear. Muddle until the strawberries are crushed and have released their juices.To avoid releasing bitter chlorophyll from the mint, use the leaves only and discard the stems. Don't shred the leaves when you muddle, they should appear crumpled when you're finished, not torn and smashed into oblivion.The texture of the sugar will help release the flavorful oils from the mint. The sugar will absorb the oils, plus the flavor of the strawberry, making your cocktail even more delicious., A white (or light or silver) rum is preferable, especially a Cuban rum if you can find it. A dark rum will add extra spice and a strong molasses flavor, which may not be welcome in a Mojito.A darker rum will also affect the color of your beverage--you want the liquid to be clear to highlight the crisp green and pink of your ingredients.


If you decided to puree your strawberries, add the puree to your drink now. You can also add a few small slices of strawberry if you like the look of fruit in your glass.

, Use enough ice cubes to fill the glass about 3/4 of the way to the top.

Make sure you shake the can of cream of coconut well, as it can settle while sitting in the can.Coconut milk and cream of coconut are not interchangeable, so don't try to substitute. Coconut milk is too thin and doesn't have the rich thickness of cream of coconut.There is a difference between ""coconut cream"" and ""cream of coconut"". Coconut cream is unsweetened, and cream of coconut is very sweet, almost like condensed milk. If you can only find coconut cream, you will have to sweeten it quite a bit before it is suitable for a cocktail.If you can only find cream of coconut in powder form, mix it with a little water so it is thick and has the consistency of condensed milk. Taste it before you add it to your drink to make sure it is sweet enough., The room will fill with the aroma of mint when the essential oils are released. This will signal you to stop muddling.Take care not to press too hard or be too vigorous in your muddling. If the mint leaves are shredded and the veins tear, your drink will be bitter and taste like grass.If you don't have a muddler, use the back of a metal spoon or the end of a wooden spoon or rolling pin.If you are nervous about muddling, you can hold the mint leaves in the palm of one hand and clap your other hand on top of them. It won't be as effective, but this will bruise the leave enough to release some of the mint flavor.Allow your ingredients to sit for a few moments after muddling so the sugar can absorb the mint and coconut.

,


Mix the drink to incorporate all the flavors and prevent the cream of coconut from settle on the bottom of the glass. Your drink should turn a milky white.

Just ensure that the glass can hold at least 5 to 6 ounces (150 to 180 ml) of liquid.

, Pour 2 ounces (60 ml) of apple cider, 1 ounce (30 ml) of pomegranate juice, and 2 ounces (60 ml) of tequila into a cocktail shaker.If making just one cocktail at a time, consider using a small cocktail shaker. You could also multiply the recipe to serve a crowd.

Add a soft drink and vodka (optional).",How to Make Halloween Cocktails4," You'll need one large cauldron and one smaller cauldron or punch bowl that fits inside the larger one. Put a block of dry ice or chunks of dry ice in the bottom of the large cauldron. Add water to the dry ice until it starts to smoke. Set the smaller cauldron or punch bowl on top of the dry ice so you can serve the witches' brew out of it.Wear heavy duty gloves or use tongs to handle the dry ice since it can burn your skin.

, Carefully pour 2 cups (470 ml) of boiling water into a medium-sized mixing bowl. Open one 6-ounce (170 g) package of lime gelatin and add it to the boiling water. Whisk the gelatin and water until the gelatin dissolves.The lime gelatin will give your cocktails a slightly green color. If you want a different colored cocktail, consider using strawberry for red or grape for purple.

, Once the gelatin is dissolved, pour 3 cups (705 ml) of chilled pineapple juice into the gelatin mixture. Whisk it to combine the liquids. Pour this mixture into the smaller cauldron or punch bowl that you plan to serve the cocktails from.To keep the mixture from warming your cocktail, let it come to room temperature before continuing.
If you'd like a less sweet cocktail, you could use apple juice instead of the pineapple juice.

, Chill one 2-liter bottle of lemon-lime soda or ginger ale. Pour this into your gelatin and juice mixture. Give it a little stir and add 2 cups (470 ml) of chilled vodka, if you'd like to make the cocktails alcoholic. Let your guests ladle the witches' brew cocktail into their glasses.You could also leave the vodka out of the punch bowl and have your guests add it to their own glasses if they'd like.

, If you're going for a 2-1 amaretto to sour mix ratio, then you'll want 1½ of amaretto and ¾ oz. of sweet and sour mix. If you want a 1-1 ratio, then you should pour 1½ oz. of amaretto and 1½ of sweet and sour mix. The sour mix is really a combination of water, sugar, and lemon juice.

Mix a simple blend.,
Prepare an absinthe drip.,
Light your absinthe on fire, Czech-style.,
Chase the “waterfall.” Instead of the drip or pour methods, use displacement to mix the water and absinthe.",How to Make Absinthe Cocktail1," Add 3 parts ice-cold water to 1 part absinthe. For a single serving, this is roughly 3 ounces of absinthe (or 3 shots) to 1 ounce of absinthe (or 1 shot). For each single serving, stir in 1 teaspoon of sugar.Alternately, absinthe can be sipped neat if you prefer the undiluted taste. But if so, drink moderately. Keep in mind that absinthe has nearly twice the alcohol content of most other liquors, which is why it is typically watered down.;
, Pour 1 ounce of absinthe into a glass, preferably a Pontarlier-style glass for the sake of tradition. Rest or hold an absinthe spoon along the glass’s rim, or substitute a fork or spork if needed. Set a sugar cube on the utensil. Now drip or gently pour 3 ounces of ice water over the cube to slowly dissolve the sugar.To really get into the spirit, be sure to take a whiff of the straight absinthe before adding the water and sugar. Also, note the milky combination of sugary water and liquor (known here as a “louche”) as the two mix in the glass.

, Pour 1 ounce of absinthe into a glass. Dunk a sugar cube in the flammable liquor. Now set the sugar cube in an absinthe spoon held over the glass. Use a match or cigarette lighter to ignite the alcohol in the cube. Let it burn for a few seconds until the sugar caramelizes. Then carefully lower the spoon and sugar into the absinthe. Once the liquor in the glass ignites, slowly pour 3 ounces of ice water into the glass to extinguish the flames and create a louche.Whether you have a traditional absinthe spoon or need to substitute it with some other utensil, always use metal, never plastic, since any alcohol that drains from the sugar cube will cause the spoon to ignite as well, potentially melting any plastic.
Either use a toothpick or similar device to dunk the sugar cube in the absinthe, or be sure to clean all alcohol from your fingers before lighting a match or cigarette lighter.
Do not simply drop the flaming sugar cube into the absinthe, since this may cause the liquor to splash out of the glass and spread flames.
If you are going to be drinking more than one round, it is probably safest to use this method first, while you are still sober.

, Place a 1-ounce shot glass inside a larger drinking glass, such as a tumbler. Carefully fill the shot glass with absinthe. Now pour 3 ounces of ice water into the full shot glass. Watch the louche cascade over the rim of the shot glass as the water forces the liquor out of there and into the larger drinking glass. Once done, use a clean, handy tool like pliers to pluck the shot glass out of the drinking glass.If you are a fan of sugar, mix a teaspoon with the ice water before pouring. However, if you like your absinthe to be less sweet, skip it, since the louche’s milky cloud is formed not by the addition of sugar, but by chemical reactions between water and absinthe’s ingredients.

Most fuzzy navel recipes call for a tall, skinny highball glass as a matter of tradition. If you don't have one, you can use anything from a basic tumbler to a plastic cup instead — it doesn't matter very much.;
, oz. of peach schnapps. Peach schnapps is a light, sweet liqueur that, as its name suggests, has the flavor of peaches.It can usually be found for quite cheap at liquor stores and in the alcohol aisle of grocery stores.


For reference, most standard shot glasses contain about 1 1/2 fl. oz. of liquid.Some larger shot glasses hold 2 fl. oz. with a measuring line at the 1 1/2 fl. oz. mark.

, Now, just pour orange juice over the ice until the glass is full. Congratulations! You've just made your first fuzzy navel.

, Don't like ice in your drink? If you have a cocktail shaker, just add the ice, schnapps, and orange juice and shake to combine. Pour the liquid into the glass — it'll be refreshingly cold, but won't contain the ice.


In a pinch, you can also stir the ingredients in another glass and pour them through a strainer to remove the ice.

Add vodka for a hairy navel.,
Add high-proof vodka for a pierced navel.,
Add dark rum for a tan navel.,
Add amaretto for an innie.,
Substitute cranberry juice and citrus vodka for an outie.,
Make your own recipe!",How to Make a Fuzzy Navel2," Looking for something a little more ""intense"" than the gentle sweetness of a fuzzy navel? Try adding a shot or two of vodka. The peach schnapps and orange juice do a good job of disguising the taste of the alcohol, so be sure to count your drinks carefully!


Note that this drink is basically a screwdriver (vodka and orange juice) with peach schnapps.

, For an even stronger spin on the classic fuzzy navel, use alcohol with a serious kick. 100- or even 150-proof vodka can make one fuzzy navel have the strength of several ordinary cocktails, so drink responsibly!


For reference, the percentage of alcohol in a liquor is half its proof number. In other words, 100-proof vodka is 50% alcohol and 150-proof is 75%.

, Vodka isn't the only kind of ""hard A"" you can use to give fuzzy navels more of a kick. The sugarcane-derived flavor of rum pairs well with the sweet flavors of the schnapps and orange juice. Dark rum even gives a tan navel a slightly darker golden-orange color that fits its name!

, The sweet almond flavor of amaretto is a good complement to peach schnapps. Try adding a shot of this liqueur to your fuzzy navels for a smoother yet more complex flavor.


You can also try adding a maraschino cherry, which have a very similar almond-y flavor.

, This unusual variation turns the basic fuzzy navel recipe ""inside out."" Here, you're using cranberry juice in place of orange juice and adding a shot or two of citrus-flavored vodka. The resulting drink has a flavor that's very distinct from a ""normal"" fuzzy navel, yet still contains hints of the original orange-and-peach combination.


Citrus vodka flavors include orange, lemon, lime, and grapefruit. Orange will taste the most like an ordinary fuzzy navel, but any works well.

, There aren't any rules about how to make a fuzzy navel ""the right way."" If you try something new and end up liking it, give it a name and write your recipe down for future use. Below, we've provided just a few examples of things to add (plus some fun names to go along with them).

Cream — ""Pale Navel""

Place enough ice in the glass to fill it.If you prefer, you can mix all of the ingredients for the Midori sour in a cocktail shaker with ice and then pour it into the glass.;
, After you’ve added the ice to the glass, pour 1 ½ ounces (44 ml) of melon liqueur, 2 ounces (59 ml) of sour mix, and 1 ½ ounces (44 ml) fresh lime juice to the glass. Use a cocktail stirrer to mix all of the ingredients together well.Midori is the best known brand of melon liqueur, and is obviously where the cocktail gets its name. However, you can use any melon liqueur to make the drink.
You can use store-bought sour mix to make the cocktail. However, you’ll get a fresher tasting drink if you mix up your own sour mix.

, Once all of the other ingredients are mixed, add a splash of lemon-lime soda. Float an orange slice in the cocktail as a garnish, and serve.If you prefer, you can substitute a lemon or lime slice for the orange.
Instead of floating the orange slice in the glass, you can place a wedge on the rim if you prefer.

Use a cocktail stirrer or long spoon to mix the ingredients together well.A Collins glass that holds approximately 12 ounces (355 ml) is a good option for the cocktail.
You can also mix the ingredients in a cocktail shaker if you prefer.
For the best tasting Midori sour, use freshly squeezed lemon and lime juice.
While Midori is the classic melon liqueur, any brand will do for the cocktail.

, After you’ve mixed all of the ingredients, put a handful or so of ice into the mixture to chill it. Stir the cocktail with the cocktail stirrer or spoon again to ensure that the ice is evenly distributed.If you’ve mixed the cocktail in a shaker, fill the glass with ice first and then pour the drink over it.

, Once the ice is added to the glass, top off the cocktail with a splash of soda water. Next, float a maraschino cherry in the drink and serve.When it comes to soda water, plain seltzer or club soda will work.
You can also add an orange slice to the drink for garnish if you like.

Heat the mixture on medium-high to high, and allow the mixture to come to a boil.Be sure to stir the mixture as it’s cooking to ensure that the sugar doesn’t stick to the pan.

, After the mixture reaches a boil, lower the heat to medium. Let it simmer for approximately 7 minutes, or until the sugar dissolves completely.While the syrup is simmering, stir it regularly to help the sugar dissolve.

, Once the sugar has dissolved completely, take the pan off the heat. Let the simple syrup cool completely, which should take 15 to 20 minutes., While you’re waiting for the syrup to cool, place a strainer over the opening of a resealable bottle and pour 1 cup (240 ml) of freshly squeezed lemon juice and ½ cup (120 ml) of freshly squeezed lime juice into it. Discard any seeds or pulp.You can use any airtight container to store the sour mix, but it’s best to use a bottle so you can easily pour it into your cocktails.

, After you’ve added the lemon and lime juices to the bottle, transfer the cooled simple syrup to it. Seal the bottle, and shake it vigorously to combine all of the ingredients., As soon as you’ve mixed the ingredients together, the sour mix is ready to use in your Midori sour or other cocktail. If you don’t plan to use it right away, make sure the bottle is tightly sealed and store it in the refrigerator.Homemade sour mix should keep in the refrigerator for one to two weeks.

, Pour all ingredients into the glass, except for the ice. Whiskey sours are typically served in a rocks glass (old-fashioned glass). Cocktail glasses are not unheard-of for whiskey sours without ice.


You may add ice to the glass before pouring (""on the rocks""), or serve the drink without ice (""straight up""). Even ""straight up"" drinks still place ice in the cocktail shaker, to chill the drink.

, Garnish the side of the glass with a lemon twist, or just a slice of lemon. If you prefer sweet flavors, garnish with a maraschino cherry instead.

(15 ml.) of simple syrup, one splash of orange liqueur, and one egg white together in a cocktail shaker. Shake thoroughly, until the egg white has broken up into froth; the cocktail will be very unpleasant if it still contains globs of egg white. When properly shaken, the egg white will make the cocktail much smoother on the mouth, and soften the lemon flavor a little.Shaking the ingredients together without the ice first may help emulsify the egg white, distributing it evenly throughout the drink.You can skip this step and just shake everything once, but shake extra vigorously to make up for it.
There is a tiny risk of salmonella infection from raw egg white. If you are concerned about this, or if you are serving the drink to an elderly or immune-compromised person, use ""pasteurized shell"" eggs., Now, place a handful of ice into the cocktail shaker and shake the ingredients again for another ten seconds. The ice will help cool the ingredients.

, Pour into a rocks glass or a short-stemmed sour glass. The small mouths on these glasses help maintain the distinctive foamy head from the egg white.Optionally, add ice to the glass first.

Go without tea.",How to Mix a Simple Hot Tea and Whiskey," Most teas, even the cheapest varieties, have light enough flavors that you will still be able to taste the whiskey. Some people recommend black or chamomile tea for this drink.


Choose your favorite tea, as all flavors can work, though.Coffee doesn’t work as well. The coffee taste is too strong, so it camouflages the whiskey too much. What you’re trying to do is to enhance the tea’s flavor.
Some people even use cheaper tea bags such as Lipton. If you are drinking the tea at night, you might try a gentler tea like chamomile.
If it’s afternoon, you may want to choose a higher caffeine black tea. Decaffeinated tea works too.;
, Before you put the tea in the water, you need to get the water hot enough to make tea.


Boil or almost water either in a teapot, in a pot, or even in the microwave, and then pour it into a mug. Using a teapot is the classic method.
Some teas have fragile leaves, such as white and green varieties. You will want to keep water temperature below boiling for those teas, at between 170 and 185 degrees Fahrenheit (or between 76.7 and 85 degrees Celsius).
Oolong teas need hotter water, at should be brewed at between 180 and 190 degrees Fahrenheit Or between 82 and 87.7 degrees Celsius). Black and herbal teas require the hottest water, at between 208 and 212 degrees Fahrenheit (or between 97.7 and 100 degrees Celsius)., Teabags can be harmful to the environment. You could also make tea with loose leaves if you don’t want to use tea bags.


You could actually put the tea leaves into a coffee maker to make tea this way.You need about 1 tablespoon for every cup of water. Simply put the tea leaves in the coffee filter.
Make your own tea bag with cheesecloth. Cut a square of the cheesecloth, and put your loose tea inside of it. Tie up the bag, add it to the cup of hot water, and let it brew for several minutes. You can reuse the tea cloth.
Use a strainer (sometimes called a tea leaf infuser). These come in different sizes. Measure the tea for the right amount you want to make. Place the tea in the infuser. Put the infuser in the tea cup. Some infusers are ball-shaped, and others resemble spoons.

, After you've boiled the water, you will need to steep the tea in the water.


Place a tea bag into the mug with hot water. You want to give the tea bag time to turn the water into tea.Different teas brew for different amounts of times. For example, it takes about 1 to 3 minutes to steep white tea but about 3 to 4 minutes to steep black tea.If you want more than one drink, use the teapot or regular saucepan if you don’t have a kettle. Fill the mug about three fourths of the way full to leave space for the whiskey.
You may want to use a glass measuring cup to pour the water. Be careful if using boiling water in a saucepan. You risk the water spilling more than if using a kettle with a spout. Don't worry about the alcohol evaporating. Alcohol doesn't boil until 173 degrees Fahrenheit (or 78.3 degrees Celsius), and most cooking methods don't cook off all the alcohol., One way you can do this is to take one or two shots of whiskey, and pour them into a one-liter teapot as the water boils.


Many people use Jack Daniels whiskey when making this drink, but any type of whiskey works. You could also make a mug of tea and then add a single shot of whiskey in it to taste. You could also use 60ml (.24 metric cups) whiskey for 60ml water, basically an even split.
Some recipes call for 1 ½ ounces of whiskey (50 ml) for every 1 cup of hot water (250ml) and 1 tea bag. How much whiskey you use, though, depends on how much of an alcohol taste you want or can tolerate.
Irish whiskey can be a good choice because it lacks smoke and has a sweet candy-like flavor. This will add sophistication to even the cheapest teas. This is also a great drink in winter weather or over the holidays.

, In the classic hot toddy drink, you add lemon and honey along with the tea and the whiskey. You can leave these elements out if you want, of course.


The honey is a sweetener that helps a sore throat. You may want to add 1 to 2 slices of lemon and 1 to 2 tablespoons of honey into the drink. Let the slices of lemon float in the top of the tea cup. If you have a sore throat or are sick, breathe in the steam.
Stir the drink. Some people pour the honey into the bottom of the mug and then pour the hot water on top of it.Many people believe that hot toddies can help cure the common cold.You don’t need to add the extras to the drink if you want, although they all have their purpose. For example, honey is often added to a hot toddy for its soothing properties., It depends on your personal taste, but some recipes for hot toddies call for adding some spice to the tea.For example, you could add in a grating of nutmeg after making the tea or a 1cm (.39 inch) piece of ginger that you’ve peeled or sliced.
Some people put a cinnamon stick into the glass after making the drink. Let the cinnamon stick stand in the mug for a few minutes to infuse it with the taste.
Some people also add white sugar or milk to their whiskey and tea. One teaspoon of white sugar is about all you would need for a single mug of tea.

, Although the classic combination is hot tea and whiskey, you can also make a variation of the drink using cold or iced green tea.


Cold green tea mixed with whiskey is considered by some to be a drink common in China. Some people put Irish whiskey, sweet bourbons or scotches into iced green tea instead. You could also use iced tea.
Green tea is a neutral enough flavor, which is why mixing it with whiskey can spice it up. However, it’s not the classic way to make the drink.
Really, you should try variations that play to your tastes. There is not one single way to make a drink, so play around and be creative!

, Although combining whiskey with hot tea is a great way to make a drink, if you don’t have any whiskey around or don’t like its flavor, you could try other hard liquor.


Scotch mixed with Earl Grey tea is one combination you might want to try. You could also mix Bourbon or Scotch with tea. Some people make the drink with brandy.Gunpowder teas have a smoky flavor that goes well with a full-bodied and equally smoky Scotch. There are many different types of hard liquor you can mix with hot tea.

, Maybe you want a hot toddy but you are trying to avoid caffeine or simply don’t like the taste of tea. There are variations of this hot whiskey drink without tea.


Place 2 ounces (.05 kilogram) of whiskey in a large microwaveable mug. Add 1 tablespoon of honey and pour hot water into the mug.
You could try using hot cider instead of tea. The process works the same way. This is a good variation for people trying to stay away from caffeine.
Add 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. Now, place the mug in the microwave for 1 minute and take it out when it is piping hot. Add a lemon slice and drink."

Serve the margaritas.",How to Make Strawberry Margaritas1," In a small saucepan, combine 1/4 cup of granulated sugar with 1/4 cup of water. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat so the mixture simmers. Cook the syrup until the sugar dissolves. Refrigerate this syrup till it's cold.It will only take a few minutes for the sugar to dissolve and create a syrup. This should make about 1/4 cup of simple syrup.
Always be careful when handling hot sugar syrup since it could burn you.;
, Wash 1 1/4 cups of strawberries and cut off the stems. Put them in a blender with 2 tablespoons of your cold simple syrup. Blend the berries and syrup until you have a smooth strawberry puree.If you'd like to leave a few chunks of strawberry for your drinks, simply pulse the berries and syrup until you have the consistency you'd like.

, Transfer the strawberry puree to a tall serving pitcher. Add 2 1/2 ounces of freshly squeezed lime juice, 1 ounce of orange liqueur (like Triple Sec) and 2 ounces of tequila. Stir this mixture to combine it.Taste the mixture and add more simple syrup if you'd like it sweeter.

, Add ice to the pitcher and stir the margaritas to chill them. Or you can pour the margarita mixture into a martini shaker. Add ice to the shaker and shake the margaritas until the sides of the shaker are cold.Avoid letting the margaritas sit in the shakers with the ice too long. The ice will begin to melt and will dilute your drinks.

, Fill your glasses with crushed ice or ice cubes. Pour the margaritas into your glasses. This recipe should make two margaritas. Garnish the margaritas with thinly sliced limes or strawberries and serve them immediately.Have straws available for serving. Choose thin cocktail straws since this will make the drink last longer than if you use large smoothie-sized straws.

You may also need to taste the margaritas to adjust the sweetness.

, Fill your blender halfway full of ice. Turn on the blender so that you completely crush your ice. If you prefer a smoother blended margarita, you could also use a shaved ice machine.You can also purchase crushed ice to use, although it may be chunkier than ice you crush yourself.

, Cover the blender and turn it on. Blend the ingredients for about 30 seconds or until the margaritas are completely smooth. If you'd like some texture in your margaritas, you may want to just pulse the margaritas so they remain somewhat chunky., Pour the blended margaritas into your glasses. This recipe should make two margaritas. If you want your margaritas to stay cooler for longer, consider chilling the glasses in the freezer before filling them.Try to serve the margaritas as soon as they're blended. They may begin to melt, especially if it's hot outside.

Make a virgin strawberry margarita.",How to Make Strawberry Margaritas3," Have two small plates ready. Add enough kosher salt to cover the bottom of one plate and pour a little lime juice onto the other plate. Make sure the plate has a bit of a lip so the liquid doesn't run out. Dip the rims of your margarita glasses in the juice and immediately dip the juiced rims into the salt. The juice will help the salt stick to the glass.Consider chilling the glasses in the freezer before salting the rims and serving the margaritas. Cold glasses will make your margaritas stay cooler longer.

, If you don't want the salty-sweet taste of a margarita served with a salty rim, you may want to make a sugar rim. Keep in mind that this will add to the overall sweetness of your drink. To make a sugar rim, have two small rimmed plates ready. Pour a little water onto the bottom of one plate and add enough sugar to cover the bottom of the other plate. Dip the rims of your margarita glasses in the water and immediately dip them into the sugar.Different sugars will give different textures. Try demerara sugar if you want a lot of crunch and a rich flavor. For a light crunch, use granulated sugar. You probably don't want to use powdered sugar since it may dissolve too quickly.

, Since strawberry margaritas aren't as common as classic margaritas made with lime, garnish with strawberries. This way, if you're serving the cocktails to guests, they'll be able to tell what flavor the drinks are. Slice limes and strawberries thinly to float in the drinks.Since fruit won't easily float in the frozen margarita, you may want to leave the fruit whole or in larger slices. Simply cut a slit in a whole strawberry so you can set it in the rim of the glass.

, You can easily add different fruit flavors to your strawberry margarita. For example, you can add frozen sliced bananas for a strawberry banana margarita. Or for a strawberry lemonade margarita, replace the lime juice with lemon juice (or use frozen lemonade concentrate). To make a strawberry coconut margarita, add a little sweetened cream of coconut for an extra tropical flavor.To garnish, consider adding sliced banana, sliced lemons, or shredded coconut on the rim of the glass.

, If you'll be serving drinks to minors or those who can't drink alcohol, you may want to make a batch of non-alcoholic margaritas. Simply leave out the alcohol. You may need to adjust the consistency of the blended margarita by adding more lime juice or strawberry puree.


You can still make salt or sugar rims for serving virgin margaritas.

, Muddle the mint and sugar by placing a cocktail muddler in the glass, then pressing lightly on the leaves and twisting. This releases the flavor of the mint and will break down the sugar.


If you don’t have a muddler, use the bottom of a spoon to press the mint leaves and rub them against the side of the glass.

, After the mint is aromatic and looks slightly crushed, pour in a splash of seltzer. The amount you use can vary depending on how strong you want your drink. Then fill up your glass until ¾ full with crushed ice., Pour in the 2 ½ ounces of bourbon. Try to use a high-quality Kentucky bourbon whisky, which is the most traditional.

Pluck the mint leaves from the stems, place them in a small bowl, and pour three ounces (6 tablespoons) of bourbon over the mint leaves., Let the mint leaves soak in the bourbon for fifteen minutes. This softens the mint leaves and infuses the mint into small amount of bourbon., After the mint leaves have soaked for fifteen minutes, take the leaves out of the bowl and put them in a paper towel.If you don’t want to pick the leaves out with your hand, pour the bourbon and mint mixture through a fine mesh strainer into another bowl. This will leave you with the mint leaves in the strainer, which you can then put into the paper towel.

, Gather the corners of the paper towel so that you create a little sack containing the leaves. Then wring the mint sack out over the bowl by squeezing and twisting the bundle.The leaves will still be wet from soaking, so when you wring out the bundle, drops will drip into the bowl.
Wringing out the mint helps to release the flavor.
After the drops stop falling, quickly dip the bundle of leaves wrapped in paper towel into the bourbon in the bowl. Then wring out again to ensure that the mint releases all of its flavor.

, Use the 1 cup of distilled water and the 1 cup of granulated sugar to Make Simple Syrup. When making the syrup, make sure to stir constantly so that the sugar doesn’t burn.If you want to skip this step, you can buy pre-made simple syrup.

, Pour 3 ½ cups of bourbon into a serving vessel like a glass bowl or pitcher. Then pour in 1 cup of the simple syrup., Start to add the bourbon mint extract mixture into the pitcher, stirring the mixture and tasting after you add each tablespoon. Stop adding the extract when you are satisfied with the flavor.


Because mint extract varies depending on the mint leaves, some extract can be stronger than others.
You should look to add around three tablespoons.

, You can serve the mint julep right away, but it often tastes better when you store and refrigerate it for a day to let the flavors mix. If you’re not serving it right away, pour the mint julep into a sealable pitcher."

If you want your drink really cold and are using a silver cup, wait until frost forms on the cup before pouring in the mint julep., Place a sprig of mint, or a few mint leaves, in the glass of mint julep. This adds flavor and also makes the drink more aromatic when you are sipping it., After garnishing with mint, sprinkle a pinch of powdered sugar on top of the ice if you wish. The powdered sugar adds a bit more sweetness., Stick a short straw into the drink and serve immediately. If you let the drink sit, the ice will melt and dilute the flavor.

This recipe is based on the use of 6-ounce Limeade cans. if you’re using 12-ounce cans, the ratios still work; you may just want to cut them in half if you don’t want to wind up with 132 ounces of margarita.

, You’ll use the empty Limeade cans to measure out your other ingredients (hence the use of “cans” as a measurement). What to add to the container:


2 cans frozen Limeade concentrate
6 cans water
2 cans tequila
1 can triple sec

, This can take 4 or more hours. You can keep the mixture in the freezer overnight; the alcohol content will keep it slushy — it won’t freeze solid., Before serving your drinks you’ll want to prepare your glasses by wetting their rims with fresh lime juice and dipping them in coarse salt.

, Remove the container from the freezer. If it has a tight lid on it, you can shake it vigorously to break up the ice and ensure that all the ingredients are properly mixed.

Know how to select a good tequila.,
Know which triple sec you want.,
Choose the perfect limes.,
Use a high-quality sweetener.,
Use big ice cubes.,
Choose a high-quality salt to rim your glass with.",How to Make a Margarita6," Tequila is the best when it is 100% agave. Tequila that isn’t 100% agave may contain corn syrup, sugar, and artificial flavors and colors. It should say 100% agave on the label., Regular triple secs range in alcohol content from 15% (30-proof) to 40% (80-proof). For a boozier margarita, choose a triple sec with a higher alcohol content such as Cointreau (40% alc/vol).


Triple sec comes in a variety of brands — popular ones include Curacao, Grand Marnier (actually an orange-infused cognac), and Cointreau.For a simpler margarita recipe you can skip the triple sec all together.

, Ripe limes have thin, shiny, soft skin; when you rub them, they should be quite fragrant.For an authentic Mexican flavor, use key limes, which are more tart and bitter than the larger Persian limes.
Alternatively, use fresh lemon juice (try sweet Meyer lemons!) for a softer taste.

, Common sweeteners for margaritas include agave nectar (if it’s not available at your grocery store, check a health food store), simple syrup, and honey.


You can make simple syrup at home by mixing water and sugar in a jar and shaking it, or by heating the sugar and water together in a pan — in both cases until the sugar dissolves. Depending on your tastes, you can mix 1.5 to 2 parts sugar with 1 part water.
A sweetener isn’t 100% necessary — some people use no sweeteners at all, instead letting the orange liqueur do the sweetening.

, Unless you’re making a blended margarita, use big ice cubes (i.e. when shaking one up in a cocktail maker). Big ice cubes won’t melt as quickly as crushed ice or smaller cubes; the less the ice melts, the stronger and more flavorful your drink will be., Sea salt and kosher salt are the most commonly recommended types of salt for rimming your margarita glass. Kosher salt will make for a slightly saltier rim than sea salt.Avoid using table salt, which will create a fine-grained, clumpy rim on your glass, and make for an overly salty drink.You can also purchase pre-made salt mixes specifically for margaritas at grocery and liquor stores.

"
Pour salt into a small saucer.,
Wet the rim of your glass.,
Salt the rim of your glass.",How to Make a Margarita7," Recommended salts are kosher and sea salt, as the larger grains are more pleasing both to the taste buds and the eyes. Aim for a 1/4-inch thickness of salt.For a tasty savory-sweet salted rim, add some sugar to your salt mixture before salting the rim of your glass.

, A popular way to do this for margaritas is to cut a slit into a lime wedge, place the lime on the glass as if to garnish it, and then run the lime around the glass’s rim.


Be careful not to squeeze the lime too hard as you move it around the glass’s rim, otherwise its juice may drip down into the glass. If it does drip down, it’s not the end of the world, it’ll just look a bit messy., There are two popular methods to salting the rim of your glass. One method is to simply place the mouth of your glass onto the saucer and give it a twist — as you would use a cookie cutter.


The other method is to hold the rim of the glass parallel to the saucer and, letting it lightly touch the salt, turn the glass in your hand so that only the outer rim is covered in salt. This method ensures that the salt only ends up on the outside of the glass so that no additional salt winds up in your drink. "

, Put the cap back on. Place in fridge for 24-48 hours.


This process is called 'infusing the liquor'. If you have time, it's best to wait about 4-5 days.
If you don't have time to infuse the Tequila, you can muddle the Habanero in the mixing tin before you add it to the iced drink. To muddle: Place a few pieces of the habanero in the mixing tin, using a muddler or a something blunt like bottom of spoon, smash the habanero with the tequila to release the oils and juices. A little muddling goes a long way.

, (If you're brave, try eating one––actually, by this point you'll discover that the habanero is pretty much drained of the oils that make it hot so they're not too bad to eat or use as a garnish.)

,, Add 1/3 less triple sec than tequila. Triple sec is your sweetener for the drink––less triple sec means a less sweet drink––it’s about a 1/3 ratio to 2/3 tequila at half full glass.

, Make sure they are very juicy and fresh. Next, squeeze a full lime into the margarita glass. Throw the used lime halves in with the margarita.


If adding the whole lime (rind and flesh) to the margarita, be sure to clean the lime prior to cutting. You never know who handled it before you bought it or what's lurking on the peel.

, Not to much; just enough to slightly change the color.


If you like your margaritas sweet, add agave nectar or simple syrup to taste.

, Put the top on and shake with both hands, keeping a tight seal. Do this until the mixing tin feels cold to the touch, usually about 5-10 seconds.


The lime should be bruising with this process, which will help give a tart taste to the drink.

, If you want to add salt to the glass, make sure you do this before adding the contents of the mixing tin. Salt should be 'coarse' grade, not table salt.

Add rum to the glass and top with ice cubes.",How to Make a Genuine Cuban Mojito," Also known as yerba buena, this mint has a citrus flavor and only a hint of mint.Unlike other mints like spearmint or peppermint, the flavor comes predominantly from the stems and not the leaves.If you're going for authenticity, you may want to grow it yourself or order hierbabuena from Cuba.


If you can't track down any hierbabuena (you may not be able to if you live in the US), substitute with spearmint instead.It is important to note that if you use spearmint, you do only want to use the leaves, not the stems. Muddling the stems will make give your Mojito a bitter taste.;
, Do not throw away the lime wedges, as you will still be using them in your drink. The smaller pieces will fit in your glass better and be easier to muddle.Hang on to the other half of the lime. No two limes have the same amount of liquid, so you may need it to add a little more juice later.You can also use the remaining lime as a garnish, cutting it into wedges or a wheel.

, For a genuine Cuban Mojito, you will of course want a premiere Cuban rum. It follows that the better the rum, the better the Mojito.If you are unable to obtain Cuban rum (this will be difficult to get if you live in America), substitute an aged white or silver rum instead., It is difficult to dissolve sugar in cold liquid, so you may have a rather gritty drink if your sugar is too coarse. If you can't find a fine sugar or prefer Turbinado sugar (which only comes in a coarse grind), you can use a coffee or spice grinder to make the granules smaller.Some bartenders and recipes may recommend substituting simple syrup for granulated sugar, but the sugar plays an important part in muddling the mint leaves. This addition also deviates from the traditional method of Mojito-making., You'll want to layer your ingredients this way to protect the mint from becoming over-muddled.Make sure you are using a sturdy glass--a glass with thin, fragile sides could break or chip when you begin muddling.


You may be tempted to use a short glass, worrying about a watered down drink, but this is a mistake. Not only will a short glass be overcrowded and awkward, but it defeats the purpose of the mojito: to be sipped and savored.Make sure there is enough lime juice to completely cover the sugar in the bottom of the glass. If it's not quite there, squeeze some juice from the other half of the lime until it's covered., Club soda and sparkling water can add to that complexity--if you can find a mineral or sparkling water local to Cuba, it's going to give you the most authentic flavors (sparkling water tastes different depending where it came from, as different springs will have different concentrations of minerals).Club soda will give your drink the right amount of carbonation, and is relatively tasteless, so it won't interfere with the flavors of your cocktail. Just make sure it's not flavored!, The abrasiveness of the sugar will help gently break down the other ingredients.You will see any remaining juice escape from the lime, but be careful not to press to hard and smash the white pith of the wedges. Your drink can quickly become too bitter if this part of the lime is overworked or broken.Try to concentrate on muddling the stems of the hierbabuena and not the leaves.However, if you are using spearmint, make sure there are no stems in your drink and that you don't tear the leaves too much, or they will release bitter chlorophyll.If you don't have a muddler, you can use a wooden spoon or the handle of a rolling pin instead., The proportions should be 1 part rum to 2 parts sparkling water.You can garnish with a lime wedge or an extra sprig of mint.

Ice your tap.",How to Tap a Keg1," The majority of Domestic beer kegs sold in the US use the American ""D"" system. However it is wise to confirm this with the vendor, as some imports may require a different tap system. Possible systems include.


American ""D"", European ""S"", and ""U"" systems

The German Slider or ""A & M"" systems;
, To insure the perfect head on your beer, chill your keg before tapping. To properly chill your entire keg (and not just the bottom half):


Line your keg bucket with a plastic garbage bag.
Fill the bottom of the bag with ice.
Place your keg in the bag and on top of the ice.
Pack more ice in the garbage bag, around the perimeter of the keg.
Pull the bag up and around the keg, while packing with more ice.

It helps to enlist a friend here. One to hold the bag up, around the keg, while the other friend fills the bag with ice.


Secure the bag full of ice around the keg.
Let your keg sit on ice for 4-5 hours.

You may need to periodically replace the ice, as it melts.



, Do not forget to also ice the tap system. Otherwise you will lose carbonation when your cold beer hits the warm tubing of the tap system. To properly cool your tap system put it on ice for one hour before you need it.

If a tap is unavailable, a screwdriver can be used to depress the ball valve to release any pressure build up. If this method is employed, exercise caution and direct the keg away from you to avoid being sprayed with any leftover contents.;
, There is a retaining clip (see Figure 1) that secures the spear (dip tube) inside the collar of the keg. This must be removed first by inserting a thin flat head screwdriver into the inside groove of the collar and gently prying it out. Pliers may be utilized to remove the clip once one end is pried out.

, It will only turn an 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) or so. Once it is turned, the spear can be lifted straight out of the keg.

, The size of the hole you cut may depend on many factors; available lid size, personal preference, and limits of cutting tools. Generally, the larger the hole, the easier the keg will be to clean but may make fitting a lid more difficult. Size of the angle grinder disc may also dictate how large of a diameter hole can be cut.

, A simple compass can be made by loosely tying one end of a string around the collar of the keg and the other around a marker such that when stretched, the string comes to a length equal to the radius of the desired hole (Figure 3). Then keeping the string taught, go around and mark out a circle on the top of the keg to guide the cut.

, Using adequate personal protection (safety glasses, hearing protection, and gloves) is necessary for safety during this step. Use an angle grinder to cut along the guide line. Make several light passes around the entire circumference until the cut goes through all the way around. If you cut all the way through in individual sections, a smooth cut is much harder to achieve.

, Using a file, first de burr any pieces of metal left jagged. Then sand the edge until it is smooth and so will be less likely to cause cuts.

, Choose a spot just above the seam where the bottom skirt of the keg is welded to the shell (the washer from the weldless kit should be used to appropriately determine the center of the hole so that the bottom of the washer is just above the seam). The hole should also be placed midway between two of the holes in the skirt.

, Using a 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) bit drill a pilot hole at the selected location. Switch to a step bit and begin drilling the hole to a larger diameter. As you drill, use cutting oil to help prevent work-hardening the keg and damaging the drill bit. Drill slowly and frequently check the hole with the threaded nipple from the weldless assembly to determine how large the hole needs to be. Once the nipple will just go through the hole, stop drilling. (Safety equipment should also be worn at this time.)

, De burr and sand the inside of the hole as done in step 7

, After the cut and the hole are made, the inside of the keg will have metal shavings and oil inside it. This debris will need to be cleaned out. The shavings can be dumped out or removed with a brush. Detergent and water will be needed to clean out the oil. Be sure to clean the kettle thoroughly.

, Screw the threaded nipple into the valve and then place the washer on the nipple. Insert the other end of the nipple through the drilled hole. Place one o-ring on the nipple and push it so it is against the inside of the keg wall. Thread the nut on the nipple inside the keg and use a wrench to snug the bolt. Don't over-tighten the nut as this will damage the o-ring. Figure 5 shows a cross section of correct assembly.

Get your cups.,
Start pouring.,

Pour the beer.,
Maintain the perfect pour.",How to Tap a Keg5,"


Scratches on the inside of your glass can act as nucleation sites for bubbles to form. Thus scratches can cause your brew to lose carbonation. To avoid this, if your glasses have scratches, simply rinse them with water before filling.
If you are using plastic cups scratches are not a problem.

,


Do not pump for the first few pints.
Just push down on the nozzle. The pressure already in the keg is more than enough to expel your beer.

, Do not worry, when the first pint is all foam. This is normal and beer will follow shortly. However you do want to make sure you deal with the foam properly. Foam begets more foam. Therefore, adding beer to the foam glass will only create more foam and waste more beer. So pour that first foam into a spare glass and let it settle before adding more.

, To minimize the head. Tilt your cup at a 45° angle as you first fill. This allows the beer to roll around the cup as it pours. As your glass fills you will return it to a vertical position.

, There is no rule governing how many pumps per pint you need. Instead monitor the flow of beer.


If your beer is expelling too fast and you see foaming, do not pump anymore. Some kegs have a pressure release valve that you can open by pulling the metal ring attached to it.
If your once-steady stream of beer has slowed to a drip. Give your keg a few pumps.

The shape of a tulip glass is perfect for allowing the nitrogen bubbles to circulate from the bottom and back up to the top.
Although any size will do, a 16oz glass, otherwise known as a pint, is generally agreed upon as the classic size for the drink.;
, Pour until the glass is about ¾ of the way full, in one slow smooth pour.


Using the 45 degree angle keeps the Guinness from frothing and allows for a better head.
Be sure to keep from pouring straight down, as it will create a fisheye in the top of the foam and large unwanted bubbles, After pouring, let the Guinness set for a minute or two so the head can develop. The nitrogen bubbles become distressed by the movement of the pour, and will gather in a creamy foam at the top of the drink when allowed time to settle.

, Fill the glass the rest of the way up, so that a dome effect is created at the top of the glass.

Select a clean beer glass.,
If you’re pouring from a bottle or can, note the sediment at the bottom.,
Tilt the beer glass at a 45-degree angle.,
Position the beer container a few inches (several cm) above the midpoint of the the glass.,
Begin pouring in a quick, steady stream.,
Start to level the base of the beer glass when it is about one-third to half full.,
Wait a few seconds for the head to settle on the top of the beer before drinking.",How to Pour Beer1," This is usually a pint glass that is clear of all oils and dirt and that is appropriate for the style of beer to be poured. It should have no fingerprints, fuzz, dirt, or residue on the sides. If it does, it may taint the taste of your beer.


There are glasses for virtually every style of beer; in lieu of a selected specialized glass, use a standard pint beer glass (16 oz. or 475 ml). This makes sure there is enough space in the glass for the entire beer and a bit of foamy head.;
, Bottle-conditioned beers generally have a small layer of yeast on the bottom of the container that you probably want to avoid for taste (and clarity). If you have a bottle, raise it to the light to see if any sediment is visible. If you have a can, check the package for an indicator of sediment – the word “can-conditioned” is a dead giveaway.


Some people like this taste, believing it makes the beer more pungent and that it gives the beer its true flavor. If you’re not sure as to your preferences, try it out – only one way to know what you do and don’t like, after all.

, The edge of the glass should be resting on a flat surface, like a table, while the rest is in the air. This will help you balance the glass and keep everything even (and get the perfect aim for your pour).

, You will be aiming to pour the beer halfway up the glass. This is the best level for aeration and foam.


Don’t touch the bottle to the glass; this is just bad form. If it’s yours it’s no big deal, but if you’re pouring for someone else, follow the etiquette of keeping the glass as clean as possible; there could be bacteria on the bottle, can, or pitcher.

, You want the beer to flow smoothly down the side of the glass without back-splash. Aim for the center of the side of the glass and keep the volume of the beer that’s flowing as consistent as possible.

, You should level the glass at such a rate that the glass lies flat on the surface just when it becomes full with about one and a half inches (or 4 cm) of head at the top. As it fills up, you start setting it down.


If too much head is starting to form, pour the beer in such a way that it does not touch the sides of the glass. This keeps it from aerating too much, keeping foam out of the equation.
If not enough head is forming, keep the beer streaming down the side of the glass until you have an inch or two of foam.

, Take a sniff as soon as possible, however; the aromas are most pungent when the head is at its peak. It's now when you'll best get at the oak-y, citrus-y, or spicy flavors some beers claim.

Kill fruit flies with an open beer can.,
Trap cockroaches in a jam jar.,
Drown earwigs using an open cup of beer.",How to Repel Insects With Beer1," Fruit flies (also called vinegar flies) are attracted to fermented beverages like beer and wine. For an effective fruit fly trap, leave an open beer can sitting out with a small piece of paper taped over the lid. Poke a small hole in the paper to allow the flies to enter the can. They will be unable to find their way out and will eventually drown in the beer.;
, Smear some Vaseline around the inside rim of an empty jam jar, and then place a piece of beer-soaked bread in the bottom of the jar. Leave the jar out overnight in the area where cockroaches have become a problem. The roaches will crawl into the jar to consume the beer-soaked bread, but will be unable to get out because of the Vaseline.

, Earwigs can be a perennial problem in the garden. To help reduce their numbers, bury a plastic cup in the ground so that it is flush with the surrounding soil. Fill the cup halfway with beer, and the earwigs will fall into the cup and be unable to get out. This technique also works with slugs and snails.

Select a clean beer glass, usually a pint glass.,
Clear the tap line of excess pressure or old beer.,
Position the beer glass a few inches (several cm) under the tap at a 45-degree angle.,
Turn the tap all the way on so that beer flows quickly and steadily down the side of the glass.,
Level the beer glass slowly as it fills so that a layer of head about an inch and a half deep (about 4 cm) develops on the surface.,
Wait a few seconds for the head to settle on the top of the beer before drinking.",How to Pour Beer2," It should be clear of all oils and dirt and is one that is appropriate for the style of beer to be poured (more on that in the 3rd section). If it was cleaned with chemicals, hold it up to the light to look for dirt and fuzz – glasses are best cleaned in hot water.There are glasses for virtually every style of beer; in lieu of a specialized glass, use a standard pint beer glass (16 oz. or 475 ml). Any smaller and it may not hold enough beer.

, Do this by running beer for a few seconds into another container. If you’re dealing with pulls at a bar, just run a tiny bit into the drain before getting started – your beer-connoisseur customers will appreciate it.


This will also give you a chance to see if the keg is running out, saving you from dirtying a glass and wasting time.

, You want the same angle under the tap as you would if you were pouring from a bottle or can. At this angle, the beer will hit the halfway up the glass, which is ideal.


Don’t touch the tap to the glass. Bacteria and germs can fester onto the end of any tap, making the glass contaminated if the two touch. If the beer isn’t for you, follow proper etiquette just to be safe.

, Some pulls will need to practically yanked, while others just need a nudge. Get it to a consistent stream and keep it there.


Keep aiming for halfway up the glass until the stream hits beer organically. If head isn't forming, keep it on the side of the glass to allow for more air to produce foam.

, Beer that is poured directly into the glass will not produce head; beer that is poured against the side the entire time will produce too much. To get into that sweet spot where the head is just the right size, start leveling the glass about halfway through the pour.


If head is forming prematurely (as some beers do), move to pouring directly down the center of the glass.
Fill it full! It's perfect when it seems like the head almost wants to spill over the side of the glass, but is kept in line by surface tension (technically lots of little bits of surface tension).

, But do take a sniff – when the head is in its full form is when the aromas are the strongest. It's at this point that you can smell the natural flavors of each beer and how they differ.

Be less aggressive with wheat beers and corked-bottle beers.,
Watch out for dregs in bottle-conditioned beers.,
Pour American Pale Lagers slowly.,
Use a double-pour when dealing with Guinness.",How to Pour Beer3," You need to be a little gentler when pouring these types of beers; their head grows larger and faster than normal. A proper head is at least 1 inch thick, or two fingers deep, but not more. Take a beer like this slow and easy.


For this type of beer, it may be advantageous to use a taller glass to allow for more foam. There’s an entire art form when it comes to pouring wheat beers, and hard-core believers even roll the bottle around on the table before finishing the pour. Try swirling the last third of the beer while still in the bottle before finishing the pour in your glass., The last ½ inch or so in bottle-conditioned beers is generally no good, so leave it in the bottle. It’s not that it’s bad (though it can lead to a yeast-y flavor), it’s just that it may cause excessive flatulence, or farting.


However, some people prefer the richer, more bitter, concentrated yeast taste. If you are one of these people, pour away.

, Beers like Budweiser and Miller are best poured slowly as in the steps above and down the side of a tilted glass. If you don’t, they’ll produce a glass full of head. While you do want some head for flavor and aroma, if it’s all head, there’s no beer.


Because these beers have little protein, a big head will dissipate quickly, leaving a half-empty glass. Creating a big head slows the pouring process needlessly – and can be quite messy to boot.

, Guinness aficionados swear by the two-part pour, or the double-pour method, for their beloved beer. This is where you pour the beer about ⅔ of the way up the glass and then wait for 30 seconds or so for the beer to settle (the nitrogen bubbles, technically). After that, fill ‘er up to the brim of the glass – preferably a Guinness glass.


Why is this important? Supposedly in creates the perfect amount of head and the best-tasting Guinness there is. If this is how they do it in Dublin, it’s probably not a bad idea.

Put whatever drink you have in your hand down.It takes your body one hour to process every drink you consume. So if you have consumed two or three drinks in an hour, then it will take two to three hours for your body to process it completely.;
, Ask the bartender for a full glass of water, or make your way to the bar’s water cooler. It is recommended that you drink a cup of water (240 ml) for every alcoholic drink you consume. So if you have consumed four drinks, then seat yourself at a table and start drinking your four cups of water.Additionally, before you lay down to go to bed, drink another full glass of water. Because frequent trips to the bathroom can deplete your body’s salt content, try adding a pinch of salt to your glass of water., Instead of eating heavy, greasy food, try to eat something healthy like scrambled eggs, chicken, milk, fresh juice, or make yourself a turkey sandwich. Despite what you have heard, greasy food cannot soak up the alcohol since it has already been absorbed into your bloodstream. But if you don’t have a choice, eating something greasy is better than eating nothing., Because time is the only real cure for sobering up, rest is a great way to sober up quickly.

Eat foods high in carbs.,
Limit your drinking.,
Avoid mixing drinks.,
Drink water and eat food while you consume alcohol.",How to Sober Up Fast3," Before you begin drinking is when you should eat foods high in carbs. Once you start drinking, the carbs will help soak up excess alcohol. Dairy products and foods high in natural fats are also great because they coat the lining of your stomach. This helps slow the absorption of alcohol into your system.Examples of things to eat before you drink are pasta, falafel, a burger or sandwich, pizza, milk, ice cream, avocado, or salmon., Try to limit yourself to a set number of drinks. This way you can avoid over drinking. One way to do this is to bring a set amount of cash with you to the bar. This way you can avoid buying too many drinks.You can also practice self-restraint and tell yourself that you will only have three or four drinks throughout the night. Do this by taking 30-minute water breaks in between drinks.

, Try to avoid mixing beer with liquor, especially if you have already consumed beer first. Also try to avoid mixing different liquors together like vodka, rum and whiskey, for example. Instead, keep it consistent with clear or dark liquor, beer, or wine.Additionally, clear liquor, like vodka and gin, is much easier on your body than dark liquor like whiskey and bourbon.

, This is another way to lessen the effects of alcohol. As you drink, snack on foods, or eat a light meal like tacos. Also remember to drink a cup of water in between drinks.For example, after you finish your first two or three drinks, eat a taco and drink a cup of water before you continue to drink.

Notice if the person slurs his speech.,
Pay attention to what the person says.,
Observe how the person interacts with others.,
Interpret the person's mood.,
Look for clues in other modes of communication.,
Consider alcohol tolerance.,
Try to get the person to stop drinking.,
Keep her company.,
Get the person home.,
Prevent the person from driving.,
Make sure the person is safe.,
Seek medical attention if you think the person has alcohol poisoning.,
Keep other causes in mind.",How to Recognize the Signs of Intoxication," A person’s eyes can tell you a lot about him and his mental state in a particular moment. If his eyes are glassy and bloodshot, it could be a sign that he's been drinking too much.Additionally, if a person has droopy eyes and he is clearly having trouble keeping his eyes open, this could also be a sign of intoxication.


Note: Bloodshot eyes could also be a sign of allergies or another medical condition. So make sure you ask him about allergies before you interpret this symptom as a definitive sign of intoxication.;
, While intoxication can mean being under the influence of several different substances, the smell of the user can be a big giveaway for many people. Both alcohol and marijuana have very strong odors that linger with the user long after the intoxicating substance has been consumed. Try to smell the person and see if you can notice hints of alcohol or weed on her breath or their clothes.


As a parent looking for signs of intoxication in their child, this is one of the most effective tell-tale signs.

, Intoxicated people can’t perform normal tasks as easily as they can when they are sober. This includes things like walking a straight line, lighting a cigarette properly, spilling drinks, or fumbling with other objects.Keep in mind that impaired motor function can be a side effect of many other conditions, such as Parkinson's disease or someone who has suffered a stroke.

, Although alcohol affects everyone similarly, the speed at which it does so will be different based upon these physical characteristics.Size, gender, the rate of consumption, the strength of each drink, the amount of food and the additional use of drugs all are to be considered when determining how quickly alcohol may be affecting someone.


For example, a man who weighs 150 lbs. will feel the effects of the alcohol much more quickly than a man who weighs 250 lbs., even if they drink the exact same amount of alcohol. This is because the larger man can tolerate more alcohol since his body takes longer to process it.

, If someone is becoming more talkative and beginning to lose some control of knowing how far he can go in a social setting, he is showing the first signs of intoxication. Louder behavior than usual — and even mood swings — are also possible warning signs.For example, loud outbursts or inappropriate comments could be signs of intoxication.
An intoxicated person may spend his money more freely than he usually would. With lowered inhibitions, people are more likely to focus on the good feeling that they get from drinking, rather than thinking about how they need to be responsible with their money. He might also buy drinks for strangers or acquaintances.
Additionally, many people like to smoke cigarettes while they are drinking. Smokers usually smoke more when they are drinking, but many nonsmokers will light up the occasional cigarette when they’ve been drinking.This is another sign of intoxication.

, There are many signs of intoxication that you can spot just by paying attention to how someone speaks. If a person is speaking too loudly or too softly, then she is showing signs of intoxication., Slurred speech is almost always a sure sign of intoxication. If you notice a person (your child, your customer, or anyone really) is slurring their words together, especially to the point where it is difficult to interpret exactly what they he is saying, it is may be a sign of intoxication.


Again, slurred speech can be a side effect of another condition or even a sign that someone is having a stroke. Don't automatically assume a person is drunk because he is slurring his words.

, If a person is being combative with her words, speaking more slowly than usual, or repeating herself a lot, these could be signs of intoxication. Watch for these verbal cues to determine if someone has been drinking too much., As he becomes increasingly intoxicated, a person will progress through the stages of poor judgment. This is inappropriate behavior that he normally would not engage in. Foul language, off-color jokes, and overly flirtatious behavior are signs of poor judgment, especially if these things are out of character for this person. Also, if his rate of consumption begins to increase or he participates in drinking games, these could also be signs of poor judgment.For example, inappropriate sexual advances, mean comments, and unusually dirty jokes can all be signs of intoxication.

, People who are intoxicated often have wide mood swings —being happy and laughing one second, then crying and belligerent a few minutes later.If her mood seems more exaggerated than normal (on either end of the spectrum), she might be intoxicated.


For example, if someone is drinking and she seems to be in a good mood, but suddenly starts crying, this could be a sign of intoxication.

, Sometimes it’s important to be able to determine if someone is intoxicated even if you are not in the same room with him.


Phone calls. An intoxicated person might call an old lover or call someone repeatedly (also known as ‘‘drunk dialing’’). His inhibitions are lowered, so calling over and over might not seem disruptive or rude to him and he may feel less accountable for his actions.Text messages. Signs of intoxication to look for in text messages include drastic misspellings, overly emotional pronouncements, or receiving a text (or a series of texts) at an unusually late hour., Remember that it's possible for people to develop a tolerance for alcohol, but that doesn't mean that they are not legally intoxicated. It just means that visual recognition is more difficult. For some people with exceptional tolerance, drink counting may be the only way to assess intoxication but this is not without problems.If you are a bartender trying to determine whether you should keep serving someone alcohol or not, try to count the number of drinks the person has had. You can even ask one of her friends how much she has had to drink or how drunk the friend thinks the person is.

, Once people drinking alcohol begin to show signs of physical impairment, first get him to stop drinking any more alcohol.Some beginning signs of physical impairment are slurred speech, slow or clumsy movements, swaying, dropping objects (e.g., goods, money, keys) or forgetting thoughts in mid-sentence.


To get someone to stop drinking, try talking to him calmly as his friend. Tell him that you think he may have had too much to drink and that you are worried, so it would make you feel better if he would quit drinking for the night. Appeal to his sense of friendship if you have to — that he is doing you a favor by not drinking anymore.
If he refuses to quit drinking, consider taking more drastic measures. If you are in a bar, tell the bartender that you think the intoxicated person has been drinking too much and ask the bartender to quit serving him alcohol. If you are in a private space like a house, try to hide all the remaining alcohol. The drunk person will not be as observant as usual because of his dulled senses, so it should be relatively easy for you to hide the alcohol without him noticing.

, If a person shows a loss of motor control or function, or poor coordination, she must not be left alone as she could become a danger to themselves or others. Stumbling or swaying, having difficulty with depth perception, and dropping things repeatedly or having difficulty picking them up are signs that the person has progressed to this level.

, If you notice someone is very intoxicated and he is in a public place like a bar or restaurant, try to help him get home so he can go to bed and sleep it off. You can offer him a ride yourself, call a cab for him, offer to call a friend for him, or call a drunk ride service if one is available in your area., Drinking and driving is extremely dangerous — to the drunk driver herself and to everyone who crosses paths with her. Sometimes people make poor decisions when they have had too much to drink, or aren’t able to correctly gauge their own level of drunkenness, so they choose to drive when they shouldn’t. To prevent someone from driving drunk you can try helping her get home another way, by notifying the bartender or the police, or even by stealing her car keys.

, People can be a danger to themselves when they are intoxicated. This is especially true if the intoxicated person is well past the point of minor drunkenness. There are many dangers to be considered — for example, people have been known to die from choking on their own vomit while they were intoxicated. So if you help someone who is drunk get home, try to make sure he is sleeping on his side so he won’t be able to choke if he ends up vomiting.


If you see a person who is heavily intoxicated but this seems to be out of character for him, or he has only had one drink, it is possible that he has been roofied. This means that someone has slipped a drug in their drink (usually the sedative Rohypnol) that will cause him to lose some muscle control and, in effect, be unable to resist if he is assaulted., Alcohol poisoning is a very serious condition that results from drinking more alcohol than your body can handle. In a worst case scenario, this can result in death.If you think someone you know has alcohol poisoning, seek emergency medical attention immediately. These are some symptoms of alcohol poisoning:


Vomiting
Seizures
Confusion
Slowed breathing
Passing out
Pale skin

, There are a number of different medical conditions which may cause a person to appear drunk. For instance, someone suffering a stroke may have a drooping face, slurred speech, confusion, dizziness, difficulty walking, and so on.If the person displays symptoms of being drunk but has not been drinking, these signs appear out of nowhere, or you are simply unsure, you can perform a few simple tests to see if the person is having a stroke. Ask her to smile, to raise both arms over her head, and to speak a simple sentence.If part of the person's face droops or her smile is asymmetrical, if one arm seems to drift downward, and/or if she cannot repeat the sentence or seems to be searching for words, she may be having a stroke and needs emergency medical assistance.
A person with diabetes may display what could be interpreted as ""drunk behavior"" when she is in fact experiencing ketoacidosis, which occurs when the body doesn't have enough insulin and there is a build up of acids called ketones in the bloodstream. If you also notice the person has fruity-smelling breath and she has not been drinking fruit-flavored drinks, she may be experiencing ketoacidosis and needs immediate medical help.Disorders like Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis and ataxia all affect movement and may cause a person to appear drunk or have difficulty maintaining his balance. Don't assume that someone who has difficulty keeping her balance is intoxicated.

Make some drinks non-alcoholic.,
Drink one alcoholic drink per hour.,
Skip drinking games.,
Resist chugging.,
Pick lower-strength drinks.,
Understand your limits.,
Stick to a plan.,
Have a designated sober person.,
Eat before you drink.,
Resist peer pressure.",How to Prevent Alcohol Poisoning1," When you're out drinking, don't make every drink an alcoholic drink. Try drinking a soft drink or water instead of alcohol for some of your drinks to cut down on your alcohol intake — try making every other drink a non-alcoholic one., To play it safe, consider only drinking a single alcoholic drink per hour. That means one glass of wine, one 12-ounce beer, or one 80-proof shot.Also, try not to switch back and forth on what you're drinking. If you're drinking beer, stick with beer; if you're drinking hard liquor, stick with that. Switching can sometimes lead to over-drinking., Drinking games encourage you to drink alcohol quickly in a short period of time. This type of behavior can easily lead to alcohol poisoning, so try to bow out of drinking games.If you really want to participate, substitute a non-alcoholic beverage like soda or juice.

, Another dangerous habit is chugging alcohol. It can be tempting to chug when people around you are encouraging you to drink faster; however, drinking too fast can lead to alcohol poisoning, as you're putting a lot of alcohol in your system in a short period of time.Any alcohol you liver cannot process floats around in your bloodstream and finds its way to the brain, where it damages cells and, in high enough quantities, can shut down the brain stem. Chugging is like mainline alcohol into your brain.

, Not all drinks are created equal when it comes to alcohol content. Therefore, it can help to pick drinks that aren't as strong, to help lower how much alcohol you consume.For instance, a 5-ounce glass of wine at 12 percent alcohol is considered one drink, while a 12-ounce glass of beer at 5 percent is also considered one drink. However, some lagers can have a much higher alcohol content. In addition, 1.5 ounces (one shot) of 80 proof alcohol is considered one drink. So if you're drinking something that has multiple shots in it, you're drinking more than one drink at once., For a 160-pound guy, 15 shots in three or four hours could lead to alcohol poisoning. For a 120-pound woman, it may only take nine shots in the same amount of time. Finding your limit is not an exact science. Many factors determine how much alcohol it would take to give you, personally, alcohol poisoning, so it's better to play it safe.For instance, how fast you drink affects your alcohol level.The weather, too, can affect your limit. The water content of your body helps to mitigate the alcohol in your bloodstream. So if you've been working out or sweating recently, or it's very hot out, your threshold for alcohol may actually be lower.
In addition, how healthy you are can affect how much alcohol you can drink, as can how much you normally drink. In other words, if you don't normally drink, alcohol can affect you more.Consider that some drinks have as many as five shots in them, so drinking that much is easier than it sounds.

, For instance, tell yourself you're only going to have three drinks. When you're done with those drinks, stop drinking. You can also pick a time to stop drinking, such as you'll stop drinking at 10:00 PM. Having someone with you who is committed to the same plan can help., It's always a good idea to have a designated driver who's not drinking; however, you can also ask that person to keep an eye on how much alcohol you're drinking to help you stop if you need to., Having food in your stomach slows down how much alcohol your body can absorb. Nonetheless, you can still get alcohol poisoning even if you have eaten, so don't think it's a free pass to drink as much as you want., It's not always easy to say ""no"" when your friends are encouraging you to drink. In fact, it can be downright difficult because you naturally want to fit in and please your friends. However, it's important to stand up for yourself, especially if the consequences could mean alcohol poisoning for you.One way to get out of drinking is to offer to be the designated driver. That way, you have a solid reason to say ""No.""Have an excuse. You could say that you have an early morning or a test the next day. You could also say that you're on a sports team, and you need to be at your peak performance the next day. As an example, you could say, ""I'd like to drink, but coach really doesn't like it. I need to be at my best all the time, or I'll get kicked off the team.""Be sneaky. You don't have to advertise that you're not drinking. If you've got a drink in your hand, even if it's non-alcoholic, people will likely think you're drinking, so just play along.Of course, you can always just say ""No."" You have a right to say what happens with your body.Escape to the dance floor. If you're busy dancing or even singing karaoke, people are less likely to try to press a drink in your hand."
"
Keep smaller glasses on hand.,
Stick to a drink or so a day.,
Find different ways to relax.,
Skip a day.,
Don't keep as much alcohol on hand.",How to Prevent Alcohol Poisoning2," The smaller the glass, the less you pour. Therefore, having smaller glasses can help curb your alcohol consumption., Try to drink in moderation. For women, that means one drink a day. For men, that means two drinks a day until age 65, then you should switch to a single drink a day., Some people use alcohol to slow down after a day's work. Instead, try finding other ways to wash away the day. For instance, consider doing some exercise, like taking a walk around the park. Another alternative is meditation or deep breathing techniques.Yet another option is spending time with your family and friends or going and doing something you enjoy., Give yourself at least one alcohol-free day a week. Even skipping one day can help you lower your overall intake. Once you skip a single day a week, try moving towards two days a week.This also gives your body the time it needs to repair any damage caused by the alcohol.

, For instance, if you only have one bottle of your favorite alcohol on hand, when it's finished, it takes much more of an effort to go to the store and buy another bottle than if you were to just grab your back-up bottle from the pantry. This can help limit how much you consume.Similarly, try buying other non-alcoholic drinks that you like and have them on hand instead."
"
Lock up the alcohol.,
Put alcoholic household items where your kids can't reach them.,
Have a conversation with your teens.,
Supervise your teens' parties.",How to Prevent Alcohol Poisoning3," To keep your kids from getting into your alcohol, lock it up in a safe place so they cannot get to it. If you don't, smaller kids may drink it unknowingly, and teens may seek it out. Make sure to include all your alcohol, not just the hard stuff., Products that contain alcohol, such as mouthwash and cosmetics, can still give kids alcohol poisoning, as well as being potentially harmful otherwise. Make sure to keep these products where your kids can't get to them., Teens need to know how dangerous drinking can be, and they need to hear it from you. Let them know that binge drinking is especially dangerous and that it can even be fatal.Make sure they know dangers of alcohol poisoning, as well as the signs. Also, lay out what can lead to alcohol poisoning and how they can keep themselves from getting it. Tell them what to do in a situation if they find one of their friends passed out — call for an ambulance. #*Some teenagers may be afraid to call an ambulance or get their friend help because they are afraid of getting in trouble with their parents or for underage drinking. Make sure your kids understand that their friend's life may be at stake, and that the consequences of not getting help far outweigh the potential punishment for drinking., If your teens have friends over, make sure to be around enough to make sure they aren't drinking.Besides the obvious fact that it's dangerous to all involved, you can also be held responsible for anything that happens to the teens, if you know what's going on and don't stop it."

Look for mood disorders.Anxiety is a common symptom of alcohol withdrawal.,
Notice any tremors.Tremors, jitteriness, or shaking might be a sign of alcohol withdrawal.,
Look for hallucinations.Even if you don’t develop full-blown delirium tremens, hallucinations associated with alcohol withdrawal (alcohol hallucinosis) may occur 12 to 48 hours after you quit drinking.,
Be aware of insomnia.Insomnia is a sleep disorder which involves difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or both.,
Watch for nausea or vomiting.,
Look for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS).WKS is actually a nutritional deficiency caused by a lack of thiamine.,
Notice autonomic hyperactivity.,
Look for headaches.Headaches are characterized by pain in the temples or forehead.",How to Recognize Alcohol Withdrawal1," You might feel constant or intermittent stress or nervousness, even when there is no apparent cause. If you feel a sense of dread or panic after ending your alcohol addiction (especially in social situations), you might be going through withdrawal.


You might more irritable or feel “on edge” after you quit drinking. This is a normal result of alcohol withdrawal.
Other symptoms associated with a disturbed mood include being short-tempered or emotionally sensitive for several days after your withdrawal begins.;
, These movements might be only perceptible to you, or they might be extremely pronounced and obvious. Shakiness might also extend to your voice and affect your ability to grasp objects.


This symptom may last several weeks. Shaking usually first appears two to four days after your last drink; however, tremors might appear seven to 10 days after your last drink.
The more serious the shaking, the more severe the withdrawal process. If your whole body begins shaking, you’re experiencing what is known as delirium tremens (DTs).This condition is accompanied by confusion, fear, seizures, hallucinations, mood changes, and sensitivity to light (photophobia). DTs are considered an emergency and require immediate medical attention.

, You may see, hear, or feel things that are not real. Multiple smaller, moving objects are a common hallucination for people suffering from alcohol hallucinosis. Hallucinations are generally visual, but they may also be contact-based (tactile) or auditory.

, If you wake up too early, feel tired even after sleeping, or wake up at odd hours and cannot fall back to sleep (or fall back to sleep only with difficulty), you are experiencing insomnia., Nausea is a feeling of abdominal pain or discomfort that precedes vomiting. If you feel queasy, or actually vomit, you might have alcohol withdrawal., Also known as vitamin B1, thiamine is a vitamin that regulates nerve impulses, metabolism, and growth. In an alcohol-dependent person, alcohol coming into the body blocks the uptake of thiamine. The effects include an abnormal gait (ataxia), paralysis of the eye and blurred vision. Memory loss, delirium, and other cognitive problems might be apparent.


Some symptoms of WKS may improve in days or weeks. In most cases, though, individuals who have WKS will have ongoing memory difficulties, ataxia, and an abnormal gaze.

, This condition refers to abnormalities of the autonomic system (the internal processes that govern your heart rate, pupils, salivary glands, sweating, and digestion). If you can feel your heart beating rapidly for no apparent reason and have recently stopped drinking, you’re experiencing a symptom of withdrawal.


Another symptom of autonomic hyperactivity is sweating. Sweating might occur as a general symptom, or might be restricted to night time. If you wake up sweating and your heart is beating, you’re experiencing withdrawal.You might also suffer from rapid breathing (hyperventilation).
Medical examinations might find you have high blood pressure while going through withdrawal., The pain may be intense, throbbing, constant, or dull. The headaches might last a short while, or several hours.

"
"
See a doctor.The first thing to do when you want to quit alcohol is to seek medical care.,
Get examined.Medical staff might monitor your physical state by checking your heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature.,
Slowly reduce alcohol intake.In some cases, instead of quitting “cold turkey,” the best way to prevent serious withdrawal is to slowly decrease the amount of alcohol you consume over a longer period of time.,
Take appropriate medicine.Depending on the type and severity of your symptoms, you may need to take certain medications.,
Prevent night sweats.Take care of your night sweats by sleeping in cotton sheets.",How to Recognize Alcohol Withdrawal2," Doctors can monitor and control your physical symptoms through medication. With a detailed understanding of your medical history and drinking habits, your doctor will be able to develop a treatment plan to help you detox safely and avoid the most severe symptoms of withdrawal.


If you go through withdrawal several times, your symptoms might get worse each time.Therefore, it is important to see your doctor when quitting alcohol.

, These vital signs can help them figure out if you need certain medical interventions or medications.

, This way, you’ll be able to wean yourself off your dependency and avoid the sudden shock to the body that leads to withdrawal.


Medical staff may substitute another sedative that imitates the effects of alcohol.
The timeline you need to reduce your alcohol intake depends on how much alcohol you consume regularly and how strong the alcohol is.
Quitting cold turkey is not recommended without medical supervision.

, For instance, if you experience anxiety, the doctor might recommend anti-anxiety and mood-stabilizing drugs. If you’re experiencing seizures, you might need to take Tegretol (carbamazepine) or Depakote (valproic acid), both of which are anti-seizure medications. Your doctor will help you decide which medicine you need.


Your prolonged alcohol abuse probably means you are deficient in a number of vitamins and minerals. , Besides medication to prevent withdrawal symptoms, you’ll need to receive these nutritional supplements and vitamins, which may include zinc, phosphate, magnesium, and thiamine., Keep a spare set nearby so that if you wake up in the middle of the night and find your sheets soaked, you can change them quickly. Have a shower before bed to relax you and clean your pores.



Yoga or meditation might help reduce your likelihood of night sweats.
Do not engage in vigorous physical activity before bed.
Avoid spicy foods in the evening before going to sleep.
Keep your room’s temperature at a lower-than-normal temperature.

Understand that alcoholism is a disease.Alcohol dependence is a disease.,
Seek counseling.Alcoholism often accompanies mental health issues like anxiety and depression.,
Get support.Talk to your friends and family about your addiction.",How to Recognize Alcohol Withdrawal3," Those who suffer from this disease will struggle with cravings and loss of control. The goal is stay in control and manage your desire. Be persistent in your resistance to drinking and prepare yourself for an ongoing mental battle.

, Perhaps you began abusing alcohol in order to cope with these or other conditions. Addressing the underlying mental health issues that may have led you to drink is an important way of preventing future relapses.


When seeking treatment be sure to speak with a professional who can help you weigh your options. You want to evaluate what works best for you personally and supports your success.

, Share with them what you’re going through and how difficult it is to quit drinking. Ask them to help you fight your addiction. Getting their support can help you overcome your addiction.


In addition to friends and family, talk to others in the same boat as you. Join Alcoholics Anonymous, Moderation Management, or another organization that helps you meet other alcoholics and stay sober.
Your friends and family might not know how to help you. Direct them to Al-Anon or Adult Children of Alcoholics so they can better understand your struggles and give you the support you need.

Don’t mix alcohol and drugs or medications.Alcohol’s effects can be intensified when combined with other substances, including prescription medications.,
Be wary of the “beer goggles effect.”Alcohol can lower your inhibitions and also impair your ability to make good judgments.,
Contact the police or other authorities if something goes wrong.",How to Prepare for a Night of Drinking," You probably won't be getting much sleep the night you go out. You could end up at an after-party with the band or doing karaoke with the DJ's aunt. Either way, you are probably not going to sleep early. Drinking also interferes with your ability to get R.E.M. sleep, so you probably won’t rest well when you finally do get to bed. Getting plenty of rest before going out drinking is essential.


If you know you're going to go big this weekend, make sure you get adequate sleep during the weekdays to prepare.;
, A night of drinking can disrupt your ability to stay focused, solve problems, and do complex tasks long afterwards. For example, drinking five or more drinks in a night can affect your brain and body for up to three days. If you’re planning to go out drinking, it's best not to choose a night that’s right before a test, major work project, etc.


Taking a break now and then from drinking as an activity can also be a good idea. For example, designating one weekend a month as an alcohol-free period can help you rest and recover., If you drink on an empty stomach, you will feel the effects of alcohol much faster, which can mean your night ends too soon. If you eat well and drink plenty of water before going out drinking, your body will slow its absorption of the alcohol you drink.


Eating beforehand stops you from feeling drunk as fast, but your body will still metabolize all of the alcohol eventually.In other words, you will still be affected by the alcohol, but you will not feel it as quickly.
Good choices of foods and drink to consume beforehand include bread, meat, cheese, pasta, milk, etc. (all foods which will be digested slowly and/or are high in protein).Continuing to eat protein-rich foods while drinking will also slow your body’s absorption of alcohol. If you can, carry healthy snacks in your backpack, purse, or close by incase you need a snack to slow down alcohol absorption.

, Alcohol can impair your decision-making abilities, so it is a good idea to agree upon a plan for the night before going out. Make sure you and any friends joining you agree on where and when to go, and when to return. Make sure that everyone will have a safe way home at the end of the night. Sticking to a plan like this will help keep anyone from getting lost or separated and from winding up in a dangerous place or situation.

, If anyone will need a vehicle during the night, make sure that someone serves as the designated driver, or that a taxi or public transportation can be arranged.


Protect yourself and others. Don't drink and drive.

, It can be easy to lose things when you are drinking, since alcohol can impair your judgment and short-term memory. Bars, clubs, and other locations can also be crowded, increasing the risk of loss or theft. To prevent this, leave unnecessary valuables at home and keep a close eye on personal items such as a wallet or purse.

, Drinking too fast is one way to ruin a night. If you have too many drinks in a short period of time, you may not realize how much alcohol you’ve had and end up sick or worse. Drinking no more than one drink an hour gives your body some time to metabolize the alcohol so that you don’t become too drunk too fast.Remember that all drinks aren’t the same. 12 ounces of beer, 8 or 9 ounces of malt liquor, 5 ounces of wine, and 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor generally have roughly the same amount of alcohol.When keeping track of the number of drinks you’ve had, however, remember that the alcohol content of individual drinks can vary widely. A high-gravity ale, for instance, could have nearly twice as much alcohol as the same amount of a light beer.
If you are having mixed drinks, make sure that someone you trust is doing the mixing, and not making them too strong.
Drinking water in between alcoholic drinks helps you to stay hydrated and from getting to drunk too fast. Just remember “Spacers, not chasers!”, Going out drinking with friends can be a way of having fun if everyone is safe. It might even seem funny if someone winds up passed out on a stranger’s lawn wearing someone else’s clothes. It’s important to realize, however, that drinking too much can be dangerous and even deadly.Females are recommended to drink no more than four drinks at a time, and males no more than five.
If you are drinking at high altitudes, remember that your body’s tolerance for alcohol may be lower.Avoid binge drinking, keg stands, and drinking games.These activities can cause you to drink too fast, lose control, become sick, or even experience alcohol poisoning, which can be deadly.
If you are worried about drinking too much, or drinking too quickly, you can try showing up late to the bar, party, club, etc.That way, you’ll have less time to drink. You can also try starting with or switching to a soft drink at some point so that you drink less alcohol.

, This helps to space out your alcohol consumption so that you don’t drink too quickly. Alcohol dehydrates you as it is absorbed and metabolized, and this can cause a hangover. Replacing that water as you drink and when you wake up will help to ward off the dreaded hung-over feeling.


Many bars have pitchers or containers of water out so you can help yourself. Make sure you locate this early in the night and visit often.
If you are at home or at a house party, keep a bottle of water with you so you can hydrate throughout the night.

, Make sure that everyone knows the plan for the night, stays together, and makes good choices.


Even if no one will be driving, you might want to designate someone to stay sober for the night. This person can help make sure everyone stays together and safe.
If at least two people stay sober for the night (to be the DD or otherwise), it can be more fun for them, since one person won’t be left alone not drinking.
You and your friends can take turns being the DD/sober person on different nights.

, If you see anything or anyone that looks suspicious during the night, stay away. Things to watch out and stay away from include:


Bar fights
Suspicious people
Dark, isolated places

, This will ensure that you do not have a drink that has been “spiked” with a drug or other substance.

, You may also not know how the combination of alcohol and another substance will affect you, making it more difficult to stay in control of your actions and stay safe.

, Make sure that you can trust the people you are with and avoid making decisions you’ll regret later.


Be prepared to practice safe sex if you think it might be part of your plans for the night.

, Even if you are drunk, or drinking underage, seek help if someone becomes injured, unresponsive, violent, or seems in danger of harming him/herself or someone else. Sensible authorities are more concerned with making sure that people stay safe and protected than with who's drinking what.

, Some cocktails are heavily based on alcohol (ie: mulled wine), while others only contain 1 to 2 ounces (30 to 60 milliliters) for flavor. If your cocktail recipe only contains a minimal amount of alcohol, consider making a virgin (non-alcoholic) cocktail, and leaving the alcohol out on the table. This will allow your guests who want an alcoholic cocktail to add it in. It will also allow your other guests (and designated drivers) to enjoy the cocktail without any alcohol., Fresh fruit will lend your cocktails a sweet, yet tart, flavor. Winter fruit, such as apple slices, citrus slices, citrus peels, and whole cranberries are all great options., Some recipes become better the longer they cook, but this is not necessarily true for cocktails. In fact, the result can be just the opposite. For example, if citrus fruits are cooked too long, they can become bitter. As soon as your cocktail is how you want it, take out your fruits and herb bundles.

Cook the cocktail, covered, for 3½ on low, or 2 hours on high.If your recipe contains a lot of sugar, consider cooking it on high for 30 minutes first. Add the alcohol, then cook on low for 2 to 3 hours. This way, you will dissolve any sugar without cooking off the alcohol.

, Alcohol can go quickly at parties, and the last thing you'd want is to have to make more in the middle of it. Unlike regular cocktails, which can be prepared in minutes, crockpot cocktails typically require several hours. It would be best to make at least two batches; this way, your quests won't have to go thirsty for a few hours., Cold glasses work great for cold cocktails, but they will cool down warm ones way too quickly. Before serving your cocktails, fill your cups or mugs with hot, boiling water. Let the water sit for 1 to 2 minutes, then pour the water out. Dry the cups or mugs with a clean towel, then serve the cocktails in them. They will keep the drinks warm and help bring out their aroma.Use this technique with care on glass; the hot water may cause certain types of glass to shatter.

, If your cocktail recipe called for things like cinnamon sticks and apple slices, put some fresh ones in bowls (don't reuse them from the crockpot), and then set the bowls out on your table. Sweeter cocktails could also benefit from whipped cream, caramel, and crushed candy."

You can prepare the cocktail earlier than that, of course, but you'll need to cook it over low heat., Consider tying the cloves up in a piece of cheesecloth first. You can also put them into a tea ball or tea strainer instead. This will keep the cloves together, and your guests won't have to go through the effort of plucking them out of their drinks.For those living in the United Kingdom and Europe, this recipe calls for non-alcoholic apple cider, or unfiltered, unsweetened apple cider. Do not use regular ""hard"" cider.

, What temperature you cook the cocktail on depends on when you plan on serving it. If you plan on serving the cocktail within 2 to 3 hours, cook the cocktail on high. If you plan on serving the cocktail later than that, cook it on low., A few minutes before serving time, fill your mugs with hot, boiling water. Let the water sit in the mugs for 1 to 2 minutes, then pour it out. Dry the mugs off with a clean towel, then line them up. The hot mugs will keep the cider warm and fragrant. If you use cold mugs, the cider will cool off too quickly., Take care to avoid the cinnamon sticks and cheesecloth pouch (or tea ball/tea strainer). You can include a few cranberries in each mug for presentation, if you'd like., You will need 1 ounce (30 milliliters) of rum for each mug.You can also make virgin or non-alcoholic versions be leaving the rum out.

If this is for a party, consider serving the spiked cider and virgin cider in different colored mugs. This will allow your guests to tell them apart.

Just before you are ready to serve the martinis, open the crockpot, and add the vanilla-flavored vodka. This will prevent the alcohol from cooking off., Pour equal amounts of sugar and cinnamon into a shallow bowl. Stir the two briskly together with a fork until they are evenly combined., Work one glass at a time. The lemon juice is what causes the cinnamon-sugar to stick to the glass. Working one glass at a time will prevent the lemon juice from drying out before you dip it into the cinnamon sugar.

Don't use cold glasses for this.

, This way, you serve the guests the martini as they ask for it; the crockpot will keep the martini warm in the meantime., Garnishing is not absolutely necessary, but it can take your martinis to the next level. You can use cinnamon sticks or thin apple slices for this."

Both you and your friends should know what your plan for the night is to make sure everyone has a safe and fun time together.Knowing where you are going and when can give you structure and something to focus on if you've had a few too many drinks.
Planning a safe way home is important if you plan on having any amount of alcohol.;
, The best way to maintain focus while drinking is to avoid drinking more than you can handle. Eating before drinking can be a good way to help you stick to a safe level of alcohol consumption. Try eating a full meal before having anything to drink to avoid being surprised by how strongly alcohol affects you.Meals can slow down how quickly your body absorbs alcohol, allowing you to get a better sense of how drunk you feel.
After a meal, you should feel full. Feeling full can help prevent you from drinking more than you would on an empty stomach.
When drinking, it's a good idea to continue eating as well.

, Meeting friends for a few drinks can be a fun way to spend an evening together. Drinking with trusted friends can also help you maintain focus and stay safe, even if you drink more than you can safely handle. Your friends can help keep you in control and focused, even if you aren't able to do so yourself. Always drink with friends who are willing to watch out for your well-being.One person should decide to stay sober. This person should be able to drive or take care of someone if they drink too much.
Keep an eye on your friends when drinking together. Don't let your friends drink too much if you notice them becoming dangerously intoxicated.
Never let a friend drive drunk.

, Plan on drinking water in between your alcoholic beverages. Drinking water will help you to stay hydrated, slow down your alcohol consumption, and cause you to feel full.

What would it be like to quit drinking for one week? One month?


If you're unsure about amounts, consider tracking your alcohol consumption for a few weeks.
Consider why you choose to drink alcohol, and if these are good reasons to continue drinking.;
, Take an online self-assessment that looks at symptoms associated with alcohol dependence. Some common indications include:


You use alcohol when you did not intend to use, and you continue to use despite negative outcomes.You lie about or hide your drinking. This can include going to different liquor stores to buy alcohol or making excuses for your drinking.You find yourself drinking in the morning, are often drunk for long periods of time, or drink alone.Your social plans revolve around alcohol.
You have a desire to quit but feel unable to stop., Hangovers and/or drunkenness can affect your day-to-day life minimally or detrimentally. Drinking too much alcohol will often affect a person's functioning, especially over the long term.Reflect on the days you wake up after drinking versus the days you do not drink, and observe whether your functioning differs.


Frequent hangovers or frequently being drunk may affect your next day's activities and may indicate a problem with alcohol., This can include consistently neglecting duties at work and/or at home, using alcohol in risky situations, having legal problems and relational problems as a result of alcohol consumption., Sometimes other people may notice changes in behavior that you do not notice. Don't dispute, debate or argue their opinion (after all, you asked). Thank them for caring enough to share their feelings with you.


Receiving negative feedback from friends or family about behavior as a result of alcohol may be a clue that your use of alcohol is impacting people close to you. , Drinking can lead to weight gain, skin problems, and sleep disturbances. Other effects of alcohol can include problems with the heart, liver, lungs, stomach, and kidneys. Alcohol can interfere with immunity and make you more prone to sickness.Consider your health prior to drinking compared to how you feel now. If you experience more difficulties with your health, it may be related to alcohol.

, If you find yourself developing a tolerance to alcohol, or having to drink more to attain a desired feeling, this may indicate an alcohol problem.Think about the amount of alcohol you consume and whether it has increased to attain a desired feeling.

, Withdrawal happens when your body receives less of a substance than it has become dependent on receiving.Withdrawal can occur when quitting alcohol and it is best to be prepared to face these symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can include sweating, hand tremors, difficulty sleeping, restlessness, and anxiety. Severe withdrawal can include hallucinations, increased heartbeat, fever, and seizures.If you experience severe withdrawal, seek immediate medical attention.

, Addiction occurs when a pleasurable activity becomes compulsive and begins to interfere with daily activities such as work, social, personal, and financial life., Having a family member who has suffered from alcohol abuse increases the likelihood of you struggling with abuse. Higher risk exists for an immediate family member, but consulting extended family is also recommended. Pay attention to a history of addictive behaviors., While genetics and personality play large roles in addiction, other factors can also affect alcohol problems. For instance, males are three times more likely to develop an alcohol addiction than are females. Also, an early exposure to alcohol also increases risk for later addiction.

If your child falls into any of these categories, pay extra attention.


There is also some evidence of alcoholism “running in families.” If your child has a close family member with a drinking problem, he or she may have an increased risk.;
, Children and teenagers who have been drinking exhibit the same symptoms of intoxication that adults do: they slur their speech, become less coordinated, walk unsteadily, and show signs of impaired attention and memory. They may feel dizzy, vomit, or pass out.


Intoxication does not necessarily indicate alcoholism. Many teenagers get drunk once or twice – or even more often than that – without ever becoming dependent on alcohol. Nevertheless, it’s vital to take underage drinking seriously. Let your child know that you do not want it to happen again, and pay attention to his or her behavior in the future.

, Children and teenagers who abuse alcohol have significant problematic behaviors and psychological changes associated with drinking: mood instability, impaired judgment, poor social or occupational functioning, aggressive behavior, and inappropriate sexual behavior. If you notice these signs of alcohol abuse, take them seriously. Your child needs help.


Alcohol abuse may entail physically dangerous behaviors like driving under the influence, which can also lead to legal problems. Be aware that someone who abuses alcohol is likely to put himself or herself (and others) at risk.

, As someone becomes dependent on alcohol, he or she will need to drink more and more to get the same effects. In addition, he or she will experience withdrawal symptoms when alcohol is not available. These symptoms include aches, pains, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, restlessness, nightmares, and mood swings. Alcohol dependence (or alcoholism) is extremely serious, especially for children and teenagers. Get your child help if you notice these symptoms.

, Sometimes children and teenagers manage to develop problems with alcohol without clearly exhibiting the signs of intoxication, abuse, or dependence to their parents. In these cases, many parents don’t realize there’s a problem until a child’s grades start slipping. A rapid decline in academic performance should be taken seriously. Talk to your child, and follow up with his or her teachers to get more information about your child’s trouble at school.


Make a particular effort to talk to your child’s teachers about attendance. Alcoholic teenagers often skip classes.

, Alcoholism makes children and teenagers much more likely to get into trouble. If your usually obedient child suddenly becomes rebellious at home, or if you start receiving complaints about your child’s behavior from teachers, coaches, classmates, other parents, or law enforcement officers, view that as a warning sign.

, As they begin to drink more and more, teenagers will need money to pay for alcohol. If your child asks you repeatedly for money, seems unable to account for his or her spending, or steals from you or from siblings, this is cause for concern.

, Teenagers often begin using and abusing alcohol when they start spending time with new friends – especially if these new friends are older and lack parental supervision. If your child seems to have dropped his or her old friends in favor of new ones, pay attention – especially if this happens alongside other warning signs.

, Alcoholics tell lies, even compulsively. Your child may be dishonest with you about where he or she is spending time and who he or she is spending it with. You may find that your child stays out later than permitted or sneaks out of the house at night, then lies and makes excuses to cover this behavior.

, If your child begins careening from happiness to anger to depression to irritability, this may be a cause for concern.


Keep in mind that many perfectly normal teenagers have mood swings. Don’t jump to conclusions, but do pay attention and look for other symptoms.

, If your child seems much less interested in or enthusiastic about his or her studies, hobbies, and extra-curricular activities, this may also be a warning sign. You may notice that your child still does these things, but with less focus and dedication, or you may realize that your child is not doing these things at all anymore.

, Most of our memory formation happens during our sleep, but alcohol disrupts sleep and, as a result, causes problems with memory retention. Watch your child’s sleep patterns, and note any difficulty with memory.

, When someone is under the influence of alcohol, the brain’s ability to send warning signs is inhibited, and the person will not modify his or her behavior (as would be the case if the person were sober). If your child is consuming and abusing alcohol, you will likely see signs of diminished rational thinking and impaired judgment.


Note that alcoholics often fail to step back and make amends for mistakes they commit under the influence. They may not seem to care. This is why alcohol consumption becomes responsible for so many accidents, homicides, suicides, and acts of sexual violence – alcohol is that potent.

, Alcohol is a depressant. It may reduce tension and anxiety temporarily, but it also works as a “downer” on the nervous system. If your child is abusing alcohol, he or she may appear very depressed – tired, sad, and withdrawn.

, Alcohol has no nutritional value and, furthermore, it prevents the body from absorbing vital nutrients like thiamin, vitamin B12, and folic acid. As a result, teenagers who use alcohol often experience a decline in their general health.


If your child is using alcohol, you may notice that he or she complains of frequent headaches, stomachaches, nausea, and sleep disturbances.
Alcoholism also negatively affects eyesight, coordination, and hearing.

, Because alcohol prevents the body from getting energy by filling it with empty calories, you may notice sudden changes in your child’s weight. If these changes do not seem to have another cause, this may be a warning sign.

, If you suspect your child has been drinking, look for dilated pupils and trouble focusing. You may also notice red eyes and a reddish tinge in the face.

, If your child is abusing alcohol, he or she may stop paying attention to hygiene and appearance. You may notice that your child smells offensive, looks dirty, or appears sloppy and disheveled.

Focus on your breathing.,
Concentrate on your senses.,
Pay attention to those around you.",How to Maintain Focus While Drunk2," If you find yourself unable to focus while drinking, it can be helpful to return your attention to your breathing. Using your breath as a focus point has been shown to help you return to the present moment and situation. Although you will still be inebriated, paying attention to your breath can give you something to focus on and a moment to catch your thoughts., If you've had a large amount of alcohol, it can be easy to lose track of yourself and your surroundings. If you need something to focus on, paying attention to your senses can be a good idea. By bringing your attention to the sounds, sights, or even something like how warm or cold you feel can give you something to focus on., If you're too drunk and are having difficulty maintaining focus on your surroundings, try talking with a friend. Tell them you are too drunk and need help. Your friend will help you to stay safe and give you something to focus on, giving you some level of control over your situation.Talk with your friends. Engaging in a conversation can help you stay focused.
If you need help, don't be afraid to ask your friends.

Stop drinking.,
Don't avoid vomiting.,
Eat something.,
Drink water.,
Start moving.,
Wait.",How to Maintain Focus While Drunk3," The most important step in sobering up after drinking is to stop drinking. The moment you feel like you've had enough, or too much, stop drinking anything with alcohol in it. This will allow your body to process what you've already consumed and start the process of sobering up.


Don't try to taper off your drinking or switch to less alcoholic drinks. Stop entirely if you are too drunk.
Don't let anyone pressure you into drinking more than you are comfortable with.

, If you feel like you need to vomit, don't fight the urge. Throwing up is your body's natural response to alcohol poisoning. Vomiting can also help remove whatever alcohol is left unprocessed in your stomach and can help you to recover more quickly. If you feel the urge to vomit, allow yourself to do so., If you are able to do so, eating something after heavy drinking can help you to sober up. Eating while drinking is always a good idea and can help your body process the alcohol at a slower pace. Having a meal or something to eat will help keep your head a bit more clear than if you had gone without eating.It's unclear which foods are best. Try eating whatever you are in the mood for.
Eating anything at all will help you to sober up faster.

, Drinking water after drinking alcohol can help lessen the inebriating effects of alcohol and help you to sober up. Drinking more water will have an effect on how much alcohol is present in your bloodstream and may help you to process alcohol faster by increasing the amount you urinate. Never neglect drinking water when you are trying to sober up.It's a good idea to try and drink a glass of water for every alcoholic drink you consume.
Alcohol has a dehydrating effect on the body. Drinking water will help you stay hydrated.

, Moving can help give you something to focus on and help you process the alcohol slightly faster than normal. By getting in some physical activity, you will increase the amount you are perspiring, which can remove some alcohol from your system. Try to do some simple exercise or activity that keeps you moving in order to stay focused and sober up.You might try dancing to help you sober up.
Going for a brisk walk can help you stay focused while you sober up.

, There isn't a surefire way to sober up faster than your body is able to process the alcohol you've consumed. The only proven way to sober up is to wait for your body to fully remove the alcohol from your bloodstream. Although you can take steps to help the process, you will still need to wait around one hour for every drink you've had before you reach sobriety again.Don't attempt to drive before you are fully sober again.
Each drink takes about one hour to be processed.

Remind yourself why you don’t want to drink.Make a list of your top three to five reasons why drinking is a bad idea and carry it on a card in your wallet.,
Reject thoughts that encourage drinking.When you want to drink, you may think to yourself, “It’s just one drink, it can’t hurt.” When you think this thought, challenge it.,
Use psychological tricks on yourself.There are a variety of ways you can reframe the act of drinking in order to talk yourself out of it.,
Don’t give in to peer pressure.If your friends are pressuring you to drink, you should resist doing what they want -- especially if you are underage.,
Get support.Talking yourself out of drinking doesn’t have to be a solo endeavor.",How to Talk Yourself out of Drinking1," When you’re trying to talk yourself out of drinking, consult the list. The list might include things like:


Drinking is hurting your relationships.
You have developed a dependency on alcohol.
You are too young to drink and do not want to risk getting into trouble.
You make poor decisions when you drink.;
, For instance, you might respond to your own internal dialogue by saying, “Wait a minute. I know that many times in the past, I decided to have ‘just one drink,’ but ended up having way more. I will stand by my initial choice not to drink.”


If you think, “Drinking is great fun,” challenge that thought be recalling all the times you did not have fun while drinking. You might be able to recall some occasions you drank too much and were really miserable afterwards.
If you think, “Drinking doesn’t hurt me,” remind yourself that alcoholism is a serious disease that anyone can fall into.

, For instance, you could adopt a “promotion focus” by looking at the situation to find out how you can end up in a better position later. In the case of drinking, you might recognize how if you talk yourself out of drinking, you will feel much better about your decision later, because you were able to make a healthy choice and do what you really wanted to.


You could also adopt an attitude that drinking is an irritation. If you think to yourself how annoying it is to drink, you’ll be more likely to talk yourself out of it. For instance, you might think about how noisy and smoky bars are, and how expensive alcohol is, and how you’d much rather spend the night reading a good book than drinking. Think about all the ways drinking is unpleasant in order to make it less appealing for you.

, Going against the grain is easy – just say “no” when your friends ask if you want to drink. Saying no takes confidence, but it’s easy when you know how to do it.


If you’re a teen, avoid hanging out with new people. Have lunch with them at school a few times and get to know them in a safe environment before going to hang out with them, where you might feel more pressure to fit in.
You might feel pressure to drink because you don’t want to feel silly. To talk yourself out of giving in to peer pressure and drinking alcohol, remind yourself how bad you’ll feel if you’re caught drinking by the authorities or your parents.

, Tell your friends or family what you’re thinking and feeling. Explain why you don’t want to drink. Ask them to help you talk yourself out of it.


For instance, you might ask, “Can you think of more reasons why I shouldn’t drink?” Your friends and family will be happy to help you.
If your family and friends encourage you to drink even though you’re trying to talk yourself out of it, avoid them, at least until you’ve successfully talked yourself out of drinking.

, Cleaning the equipment only helps you to break up grime and residue; sanitizing to kill microbial life is the next important step. Sanitize all of the equipment with a no-rinse brewery sanitizer. StarSan and QuickSan are 2 very popular products for this task.

Otherwise, buy about 6 gallons (22.7 L) of spring water from the store. Do not use distilled water, which lacks the trace minerals that can smoothen your beer's flavor.

, Because yeast are living organisms, they must be stored in your refrigerator until needed. Before brewing, however, give them a couple hours out on the countertop so that they will be at room temperature when you need them. This ""wakes them up"" a bit and prevents them from being shocked by a dramatic swing in temperature.

Think about how drinking affects your health.,
Maintain healthy relationships.,
Meet your responsibilities.,
Save your money.,
Get in shape.,
Fulfill your moral commitments.Many religions around the world forbid or discourage alcohol consumption.",How to Talk Yourself out of Drinking2," Drinking can have negative impacts on your health. Even moderate consumption can lead to impaired judgment and a lack of coordination, which could cause you to lose your balance or make decisions that might hurt you or someone else. Drinking in excess, over time, could inflame your liver or give you cirrhosis (scarring of the liver). Alcohol consumption has also been linked to cancer of the breast, colon, larynx, mouth, and esophagus.Pregnant women risk miscarriage, stillbirth, or fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in their children.

, Drinking can be disruptive to your friendships and romances.When you drink, you might say or do things that under normal circumstances you would not. Think about your own experience with drinking and how it has affected your relationships with others. How do your friends and family feel about you drinking? Are you proud of yourself when you look back on things you’ve said or done when you’re drinking? Think about how drinking affects your relationships in order to develop a compelling reason why you should not drink.

, If you start drinking, you might have a hangover and be unable to go to school or work the next day. Even if you are able to get up and go, you might not be able to devote your full attention and energy to your work. This could hinder your professional or academic development. Think about your other responsibilities when you’re trying to talk yourself out of drinking., Alcohol is expensive.Instead of drinking, take the money that you would have spent on booze and put it in a little jar. When the jar is full, cash the money in and do something fun. For example, you might:


buy a new book
use the money on a short day-trip to the city with friends
go shopping
purchase new art supplies

, Alcohol has a lot of hidden calories. But unlike the calories from healthy food, alcoholic calories are empty and without any nutritional benefit. Alcohol has a high calorie density, second only to fat. People who drink – especially when they drink frequently – are at risk for developing a “beer belly” – a layer of abdominal fat. Think about how drinking is going to hurt your beach bod next time you’re trying to talk yourself out of it.

, Think about what your own faith says about drinking. If you are irreligious, ask yourself if drinking is compatible with your own ethical outlook. Will drinking help you meet your full potential? Does it have a positive impact on you and those around you?

Distract yourself.There are countless other things to do besides drink.,
Find a healthy way to unwind.Lots of people drink because it helps them relax after a long day at work or school.,
Get a change of scenery.,
Just say no.Sometimes the easiest thing to do is to just make a decision not to drink and stick to it.",How to Talk Yourself out of Drinking3," Play a video game with a friend, watch a movie, or read a book. Whatever you like to do for fun when you’re not drinking, do it. Distract yourself for as long as you need to in order to not drink. Useful distractions include:


Baking a new recipe
Riding your bike
Calling a friend on the phone
Watching an online video
Playing a song you like on guitar

, But there are other ways to feel just as relaxed that don’t involve drinking. Join a yoga class, or go for a run or bike ride. Meditation is also a good option.


Almost any kind of cardiovascular exercise can be used to help you unwind naturally after a long day.
You could also try taking a relaxing bubble bath.
Visit the spa for a pleasant massage.

, If everyone else is drinking, you might feel pressure to drink, too.Instead of going to the party where everyone is drinking, try going shopping or going out for a bite to eat. Don’t be afraid to propose alternatives to your friends when they want to drink.


If your friends are never or rarely interested in doing anything but drinking, and the directly or indirectly pressure you to drink, you might need new friends.
Alternatively, if your friends want to go drinking but you do not, make yourself the designated driver for the whole gang.
If you’re already in a situation where others are drinking and you’re having a hard time managing your urge to drink, make a graceful exit and head home.

, After all, nobody can force you to drink. Ignore the urge without doing anything extraordinary to distract yourself or avoid alcohol.


If a friend asks you to drink with them, say, ""No thank you, I am not interested in drinking right now.""
Sometimes you can set a good example for your friends or others simply be refusing to drink.

"

Ask yourself if drinking is acceptable for you.,
Understand excessive drinking.,
Get help if you need it.",How to Talk Yourself out of Drinking4," Certain people should not drink under any circumstances, even in moderation.If you are pregnant or younger than 21 years old, you should not drink. You should also never drink if you’re driving, planning on driving, or using heavy machinery of any kind (including a go-cart, golf cart, chainsaw, or other device that requires coordination and fine motor skills).


In addition, individuals with certain medical conditions should not drive. Think about your medical history and any medications you might be taking before drinking alcohol.
Anyone who should not be drinking but does anyway is in need of help from a substance abuse counselor.

, The Center for Disease Control (CDC) defines heavy drinking as more than one drink per day for women and more than two drinks per day for men over the course of a week. Binge drinking is even more serious. For women, binge drinking is defined as drinking four or more drinks during a single occasion. For men, the number is five drinks or more in a single occasion. Both binge drinking and heavy drinking are excessive, and indicate that you need help managing your alcohol consumption.Excessive drinking may or may not interfere with your ability to function on a day-to-day basis. It is obvious that people who regularly cannot get to work or school due to excess alcohol consumption need help, but if you meet the qualifications for excessive drinking and still manage to have a successful career and social life, you also need to reduce your alcohol intake.

, There are many resources available for individuals who drink excessively.The most well-known group that helps people deal with their excessive alcohol intake is Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). There are AA chapters in almost every country in the world.


AA uses a 12-step program to help you live a life free of alcohol abuse, and introduces you to others who share the same struggle in order to help you learn from their experiences. Look for local chapters in your area.
Additionally, you should consult a substance abuse counselor to deal with your problem one-on-one. Substance abuse counselors are specially trained to help you understand and overcome your reliance on alcohol. You can locate one by contacting your local health department or addiction treatment centers.

Fill the brew kettle with water.,
Steep any specialty malt.,
Add the malt extract.,
Monitor the hot break.,
Add the hops to your wort.",How to Micro Brew Beer2," Fill your brew kettle with about 3 gallons (11.3 L) of water. You should have enough headspace in the kettle to allow for a vigorous, prolonged boil. Note that about half a gallon (2 L) of this water will evaporate during the boil; this is to be expected.

, If your beer recipe calls for specialty malts, tie the malted grains into a grain bag. Bring the water to about 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius), turn off the heat, and then add the specialty malt. Let the grains steep for about 30 minutes.

, After removing the specialty grains, turn the heat back on and bring the kettle to a boil. Slowly stir in your liquid or dried malt extract, which will act as your beer's base malt. Stir continuously to keep the malt extract from burning on the bottom of the pot.

, As the malt and water mixture (now called ""wort"") begins to boil rapidly, you will see a rapid build-up of thick foam on the surface. This is called the ""hot break,"" and is caused by the proteins in the malt. Watch the heat carefully to prevent boil-over, reducing it if necessary. The hot break will dissipate gradually over about 10 minutes.

, Hops are the ingredient that give a beer its bitterness and floral flavor. The longer they are boiled, the more bitterness they impart, but the less flavor they impart. To correct for this imbalance, you will add the hops at 3 different points.


Add the bittering hops just as soon as you've let the hot break settle a bit. Note that this first hop addition will cause some extra foaming.
Add the flavoring hops with only 15 minutes left to go in the boil. These hops are used to provide floral and fruity flavors to the beer.
Add the finishing hops to the boil with less than 5 minutes left in the boil. These hops impart the beer's aroma.
Remove all of the hop bags when the boil is finished.

Pour the wort into your fermenter.,
Allow the beer to ferment for 10 to 14 days.,
Prime the beer for bottling.,
Bottle the beer.",How to Micro Brew Beer3," The wort must be cooled to room temperature before pitching the yeast. This must be done as fast as possible to give unwanted bacteria minimal time to proliferate in the wort. Placing the kettle in the sink surrounded by an ice bath is the most straightforward method for cooling the wort.

, Once the liquid has reached room temperature, pour the yeast into the wort. Stir the wort a bit with a sanitized spoon to ensure dispersal.

, Place a sanitized funnel into the opening of your fermenting vessel and pour the wort into it. You may want to prevent the foam and sediment at the bottom of the kettle from entering the fermenter. Top the liquid off with spring water to about 5 gallons (19 L).

, Place a sanitized airlock into the fermenter opening to allow for excess gas to escape, and place the fermenter in a dark, cool location. After a day or so, you should see a thick layer of foam (called ""krausen"") forming on the liquid. Fermentation will be complete in about 10 to 14 days.

, Dissolve a mixture of corn sugar in water according to your beer recipe's amounts. Pour this syrup into the fermenter, where it will provide sugar to prod the yeast into carbonating your beer in the bottles.

, Insert a long piece of tubing into the fermenter and attach a bottle filler tool to the other end. Use the bottle filler to start the siphon and fill each bottle to its neck. Cap the bottles promptly and refrigerate them. They should be conditioned and ready to drink in about 2 weeks.

Decide on a base beer style.,
Brew the beer as you normally would.,
Rack the beer into the primary fermenter.,
Transfer the beer into the secondary fermenter.,
Bottle or keg the raspberry beer.,
Enjoy your raspberry beer.",How to Make Raspberry Beer," You will be adding fruit to a base beer recipe, so you'll need to decide what style of raspberry beer to brew. In general, berries pair well with light, mild beers or rich, dark beers.

Mild styles of beer such as blonde ales, Hefeweizens, and pilsners pair well with raspberries, making for a fruity, refreshing, and summer-friendly beer.
Rich, malty styles of beer like stout and porter also work well with raspberries, where the fruit's tartness contrasts nicely with the smoky, chocolate overtones of the roasted malt.;
, On brew day, you will do everything as you normally would, because you won't be adding the fruit until secondary fermentation. If you brew using the all-grain method, you will also mash and sparge the grain as usual., After boiling and cooling the wort, rack it into your primary fermenting vessel as usual. It is possible to add the raspberries during primary fermentation, but there are several major reasons why you should avoid doing this.

Because the yeast have not had time to proliferate at this point, adding the raspberries poses a significant risk of bacterial infection, which will produce unpleasant flavors in your beer.
Adding raspberries during primary fermentation will also lead to the nearly complete fermentation of the fruit's sugars, which will cause the raspberry flavor to dissipate significantly.

, Once the vigorous fermentation is complete, you are ready to begin secondary fermentation and add the raspberries. You have several options for adding the fruit to the fermenting beer.

A popular option is to pour raspberry puree into the fermenter. This puree is readily available from brewing supply stores; it will provide intense flavor but will cloud your beer's appearance.
Another option is to steep dried raspberries in the beer. This tends to produce a more nuanced flavor and preserves the beer's visual clarity.
A third option is to add fresh raspberries to the fermenter. Because fresh raspberries have a high water content, however, you will need to add a lot to achieve noticeable flavor.

, When secondary fermentation is complete, you will bottle or keg the beer as usual. You may need to strain the beer when transferring it to your bottling bucket to remove any raspberry seeds or skins, but you can usually keep these impurities out by stopping your siphon before they are sucked up., The addition of fruit does not change the time needed for bottle conditioning. When the beer has been fully conditioned, crack one open and enjoy. You can garnish the beer with fresh fruit to augment the fruit flavors."

Consider brewing a lemon wheat beer.,
Try creating a lemon lager.,
Pair lemon with a darker, richer beer.",How to Make Lemon Beer1," There is a reason why many styles of mild wheat beer, such as German Hefeweizens and Belgian Wits, are served with a lemon wedge in the glass. The bright, lively citrus notes pair excellently with the smooth, earthy flavor of wheat beer.;
, Lemon also pairs excellently with light lager-style beers like Pilsner and pale American lagers. In fact, a popular summer cocktail called a shandy takes advantage of this very pairing by combining pale lager beer and lemonade.

, While this combination is not as popular, you may also find that lemon works well with rich, flavorful beers like stout, porter, and IPA.

Pour lemon juice into the secondary fermenter.,
Steep lemon peel in the secondary fermenter.,
Utilize a prepared lemon product.,
Add lemon just before drinking.,
Finished.

",How to Make Lemon Beer2," The most straightforward way to brew lemon beer is to add a small amount of lemon juice to the beer during secondary fermentation. Some of the sugars in the lemon juice will undergo fermentation, which will add complexity to the beer. However, the basic brightness of the lemon will remain present in the beer's finished flavor.

, An option for adding more subtle lemon flavor to your beer is to steep lemon peel in the secondary fermenter. The lemon peel contains the fruit's essential oils, which are very flavorful and will not be metabolized by the yeast. You can also steep complementary spices in the secondary fermenter, such as clove or cinnamon.

, A third option for making lemon beer is to use a prepared product such as lemon jam. The flavor in these products is often more concentrated than in lemon juice, and it won't tend to dissipate so much between fermentation and consumption. Note that the sugar present in jams and jellies will increase the gravity of your beer.

, Of course, a simple way to make sure the lemon tastes as fresh as possible in your beer is to add it to your glass just before drinking. Adding a lemon wedge to your beer glass can be an easy way to improve its presentation or even to test a beer recipe for the possible addition of lemon during fermentation.

, Let it sit for 5 minutes, you know the yeast is ready when its doubled in size. The Yeast could arguably be the most important ingredient of your brew. In layman's terms yeast eats sugar and excretes ethanol and carbon dioxide. Ethanol is the part of alcohol that gets you ""drunk"" and carbon dioxide will make your brew fizzy (if the cap is screwed on tighter).

Enjoy.",How to Make Hard Cider," Apple juice and yeast are the only essential ingredients, but there are a few other ingredients that can be added in order to alter the final product.

You can either use apple juice or apple cider. Many prefer the taste of pasteurized, sweet apple cider, but you could use fresh apple juice just as easily. Note, however, that unpasteurized juice will need to be sanitized before you can ferment it.
Dry wine yeasts are affordable and effective. Beer yeasts are also affordable, and many beginning cider makers find them easier to work with. Specialized yeast packages specifically labeled for use with hard apple cider are also available but tend to be more expensive.
Pectic enzyme helps clear cloudiness and is often used with heat-brewed cider.
Adding sugar to the cider will product a higher alcohol content.
The extra apple juice is only needed if you plan to use a starter.;
, All of your supplies need to be washed with hot water and mild dish detergent before use.

Rinse well to remove any soapy residue.
Let the supplies dry completely before use.
Wild bacteria can cause the cider to taste bad and can even turn your batch of hard cider into vinegar.

,

Pour your apple juice into a resealable container with a tight lid.
Pour half of your yeast into the apple juice, seal the container, and shake well for a few seconds.
When bubbling occurs, release the pressure inside the container by opening the lid. Note that it may take five to six hours before bubbling starts.
Reseal the lid and place the container in the refrigerator overnight.
Remove the starter a few hours before you brew your cider.

, Using heat to brew your hard cider is the safest, most common method.

If starting with unpasteurized juice from an unknown source or juice from imperfect apples, the heat method is the safest one to use.
Heat does reduce the aroma of the cider, however. The heat is also more likely to lead to a cloudy cider.

, Place the saucepan of cider on the stove and heat over medium.

Do not allow the juice to boil. The high temperatures required for boiling to occur will cause the pectins in the apple juice or apple cider to set. As a result, you will end up with a cloudier cider.
Monitor the heat of the juice using a food-grade thermometer that clips onto the side of your saucepan. Make sure that the thermometer take the temperature of the liquid, not the temperature of the side or bottom of the pan.

, Once the juice or cider reaches this temperature, cover the saucepan with a lid and let sit for 10 minutes.

Peek at the juice through the lid frequently to make sure that it has not begun to boil.

, Fill a large tub or container with cold water and ice. Place the covered saucepan in the ice water to quickly bring down the temperature.

Your juice is ready for the next part of the process once it reaches 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius).

, This is an alternate brewing method and should be used if you do not intend to heat your juice before fermenting it. You should not use both brewing methods.

Sulfites come in the form of campden tablets.
The sulfites are fairly mild and are usually neutralized by the time the cider is ready to enjoy.
You will need to let the juice sit for a while after adding the sulfites in order to reduce the strength of the sulfites. Otherwise, the sulfites may kill some of the yeast.

, Pour the juice or cider directly into the container you intend to ferment the cider in.

A professional-grade fermenter leaves the smallest room for error, but you can use five 1-gallon (4-L) empty milk jugs for a cheaper option.

, Use the back of a spoon to crush the tablets into a fine dust.

Crush the tablets on a plate or other surface that you can easily remove the powder from.

, Add the crushed campden tablets to your juice or cider and stir slightly with a spoon to mix., Cover the fermenter and allow the sulfites to sit in the juice for a full two days before you ferment the cider.

You will ferment the juice with remnants of the sulfites in it. These sulfites will not get filtered out.

, Bring the water to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Turn the heat off once the water boils.

You only need to boil the water if you plan on using a yeast nutrient, and you only need to use a yeast nutrient if you do not plan to use a starter. A starter essentially serves the same purpose as the yeast nutrient, so you only need to use one or the other.

, Stir the yeast nutrient into the hot water until dissolved. Let the water cool until it reaches a range between 80 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit (27 and 38 degrees Celsius).

Note that it is perfectly normal for the mixture to smell bad after you add the yeast nutrient.

, If desired, stir the pectic enzyme into the mixture once it drops to room temperature.

Pectic enzyme is used to clear cloudiness.
If using a starter instead of the yeast nutrient, combine the pectic enzyme with the starter just before adding the starter to the fermenter. Make sure that the starter is at room temperature.

, Pour your juice into the fermenter if it is not already inside. Add the nutrient mixture or starter to the juice and stir slightly to combine.

A professional-grade fermenter may work best, but you could use five 1-gallon (4-L) empty milk jugs for a cheaper option.
Make sure to leave at least 2 inches (5 cm) of empty headspace at the top of the fermenter.

, The sugar is not necessary, but adding sugar to the juice before you ferment it will create a cider with a higher alcohol content.

Moreover, hard cider with sugar in it will continue to improve the longer it ages.

, Gently stir any remaining yeast into your cider.,

Fit the airlock into the top of the fermenter.
Note that instead of an airlock, you could use a piece of plastic wrap stretched over the top of the fermenter and held in place with a rubber band. This method does not work quite as well, but is usually effective.

, Place the cider out of direct sunlight in an area that reaches between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18 and 24 degrees Celsius).

The cider should ferment over the next two weeks. During this time, expect to see activity through the clear sides of the airlock.
Once you no longer see any activity in the airlock, wait another 3 to 5 days before bottling the cider.

, This is not absolutely essential, but it is the best way to verify that the fermentation process has been completed.

The hard cider should also taste quite dry.

, Your hard cider is ready to bottle as soon as the fermentation process is finished.

Attach a plastic spigot to the fermenter if it does not already have one on it. Fix food-grade tubing to this spigot, and pour the cider directly into clean, food-grade bottles.
Seal the bottles.
Within two weeks, the cider should be ready to drink.
Wait for several months if you want it to be fizzy.

, If your hard cider is too cloudy for your liking, clarify it by putting it through a second fermenter before bottling it.

Siphon the cider into a second fermenter using a spigot and food-grade tubing.
Allow the cider to ferment in this container for an extra month.
Bottle the clarified cider using the same method you would use to bottle hard cider immediately, as outlined above.
Note that clarified cider will not have any bubbles.

, Store your hard cider for months and enjoy as desired."

Choose a beer for your citrus beer punch.,
Make a lemon simple syrup for the beer punch.,
Add the simple syrup and some fresh citrus juice to a punch bowl.,
Add the beer to the punch bowl just before serving.",How to Make Citrus Beer Punch," There are several styles of beer that work well in a citrus-based punch preparation. The ubiquitous American-style light lager (think Budweiser, Coors, Miller, et cetera) has a mild flavor that perks up wonderfully in a citrus punch.


Wheat beers, such as Hefeweizen and Belgian Whites, are often served with wedges of lemon or orange precisely because they pair so well with citrus. Widely available brands of wheat beer include Blue Moon, Hoegaarden, and Paulaner.
For a richer flavor in your punch, you can use hop-heavy beer styles like pale ale and IPA. Avoid using very malty or intense styles of beer such as porter or stout, as these will quickly overwhelm the citrus and weigh down your punch.;
, A simple syrup is an effective way to provide sweetness to a punch. In this recipe, the simple syrup will be infused with an intense flavor using lemon peel.


Bring equal parts water and sugar to a simmer in a saucepan. Stir until the sugar has completely dissolved.
Add a few strips of lemon peel to the mixture. Simmer for about 10 minutes, and then allow the mixture to come to room temperature while the lemon peel infuses.

, When the simple syrup has cooled, remove the lemon peel and pour the mixture into a punch bowl. The next ingredient to add to the punch is citrus juice, preferably freshly squeezed.


A good option is using equal parts grapefruit and lemon juices. Grapefruit juice can be purchased in bottled form, but lemon juice tastes much fresher if you juice the lemons yourself.
You can juice the citrus over a strainer to prevent the seeds and pulp of the fruit from entering the punch bowl.

, When you are ready to serve the punch, pour a generous amount of beer into the punch bowl. Adding the beer too early will allow it to lose its carbonation, making the beer punch taste flat.


You can adjust the ratios of simple syrup, citrus juice, and beer to your taste. A good starting point is 3 parts beer, 2 parts citrus juice, and 1 part simple syrup. Adjusting these ratios will allow you to make the punch more sweet or more tart.
Serve the beer punch over ice in tall glasses or beer mugs. Garnish with a lemon wedge if desired.

Finished.

",How to Make Beer Labels," Rather than simply identifying your beers by style, brew date, or other prosaic details, consider giving them each creative names. Browse the craft beer selection at your favorite stores to get ideas for beer names.


Remember that some beer styles tend to follow specific naming conventions. Doppelbocks, for example, traditionally have names ending in ""-ator"" - Optimator, Maximator, and Triumphator, for instance.





;
, Labels on beer bottles can vary widely in size. Some are wide, horizontal bands that wrap all the way around the bottle, while others are small oval-shaped badges. To decide on a size, it is easiest to measure the dimensions of an existing beer label that you admire.

, Open your favorite image editing software and create a new file with the dimensions that you measured from an existing label. Set the resolution to 200 points per inch (80 per cm) or above, as this will ensure adequate print quality.


If you do not have any image editing software on your computer, you can download an open source piece of software called GIMP - the GNU Image Manipulation Program.







, Make sure to add your beer's name and style somewhere on the label. Additional information to consider including might be the brew date, specific gravity or alcohol by volume, and of course, the brewmaster's name. If your graphic design skills leave something to be desired, you can find free clip art on the Internet for use on your beer labels.

, When you are finished designing your beer labels, you are ready to print them. The most straightforward approach is to load your printer with 8.5x11"" (22x28 cm) adhesive-backed paper. This way, you can simply cut the labels out of the paper with scissors.

, After cutting the labels from the sheet of sticker paper, remove the backing and position them carefully onto each bottle. This step is best done after the bottle has been filled and capped so that errant drips of water, beer, or sanitizer solution do not mar the label's appearance.


Wiping the bottle clean of dust and moisture before affixing the label will ensure a good seal.

Select your cider.,
Choose a blend of spices yourself.,
Mull the cider with your chosen spices.,
Make spiced butter.,
Add butter to your cider just before serving.",How to Make Hot Buttered Cider1," The most important component of a hot buttered cider is the cider itself. Since you’ll be heating the cider with spices, or mulling it, choose a cider with a thick, cloudy body. Choose an unfiltered cider that's as fresh as possible. During the fall, look at your local farmer’s market to find the best options in your area.Note that mulling your cider with some or all of the spices you want to use before adding the butter will provide a more satisfying, complex, and enjoyable beverage.;
, Though store-bought mulling blends are available, you’ll get a better flavor by the spices you want to use by hand and customizing how much you want of each. There are, of course, a few reliable spices that pair especially well with cider (and, of course, with butter).Use cinnamon to add sweetness and spice. Star anise can also be used for similar effect, with the additional flavor attribute of licorice.
Clove will add depth to the flavor of the cider itself, which will be reduced by the mulling process.
Include coriander to emphasize the muskiness of the cider and add a bit of a citrus kick. Add a bit of cardamom as well. This will enhance the aroma of the cider.
Allspice and nutmeg are also common ingredients in mulled cider drinks. While they are enjoyable and reliable, don’t consider them absolutely necessary, and take care not to use too much!

, The best method for making hot buttered cider involves mulling the cider first, and adding butter just before serving. Mulling cider beforehand allows you to cook the flavor of the spices into the cider. To do so, simmer the cider and spices together for about thirty minutes.Use whole spices whenever possible. For instance, toss a few cinnamon sticks into the cider instead of using ground cinnamon.
Include a few fresh orange or lemon peels in the mulling process.
For spices that are already ground, default to about ½ teaspoon per 16 fluid ounces of cider. If you’re on the fence about amounts of certain spices, always default to less. This will allow the flavor of the apples themselves to show through.

, However you choose to mull your cider, you can make a spiced butter to emphasize certain flavors in your hot buttered cider. For instance, you may prefer to mull your cider with only citrus peels and cinnamon sticks, and make a spiced butter with the other spices you've chosen, such as ground allspice and nutmeg.


For one option, soften 8 ounces of unsalted butter and whip until creamy in a mixing bowl. Add 2 ounces of brown sugar, ⅛ teaspoon of cinnamon, ⅛ teaspoon of allspice, and a pinch of ground clove.
After mixing in your spices, re-roll the butter into a log or press it into a small bowl. Cover the butter and refrigerate it if you're not ready to use it.
The main advantages of making spiced butter is having more control over the amount of butter and spice in each serving. For instance, you can make individual portions that have more or less butter and spice.
You can also make a large batch of spiced butter to use in several different batches of mulled cider over the course of a few days.

, If you've just mulled the cider and it's still warm, you can simply add regular butter or spiced butter. The amount of butter you’ll want to add depends on the amount of cider you plan to serve. Aim for about a small spoonful of butter per serving.You can melt the butter into the pot containing the whole batch of cider, or allow people to add butter themselves to individual servings. If adding butter yourself, stir it into the cider while the batch simmers over low heat.
Adding butter to individual servings allows everyone to customize their drink - and to decided whether to stir their butter until it's fully melted, or allow the butter to slowly melt while it floats on the surface of their beverage.
Always serve hot buttered cider when it is still steaming. Be sure to warn everyone that the drink is hot.

Make a batch of buttered cider with rum.,
Use bourbon for a boozier, spicier cocktail.,
Blend together a party-sized batch with apple brandy.",How to Make Hot Buttered Cider2," Hot buttered rum can be made a few different ways, but is arguably best when cider is used. For a batch that will yield eight servings, gather a half gallon unfiltered apple cider, 1 stick unsalted butter, ¼ cup dark brown sugar, 1½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon nutmeg, ¼ teaspoon ground cloves, ⅛ teaspoon salt.Add the butter, brown sugar, and spices to the cider as it simmers in a pot with the burner set to low. Stir until the butter and the sugar are entirely dissolved.
Use a ladle to serve the hot buttered cider into individual mugs, adding rum as desired. The amount and type of rum you use is up to you. The darker the rum, the more likely it will add sweetness to the drink.

, Substituting rum for bourbon essentially provides a twist on an old classic. For a strong, two-serving batch, use 1 cup cider, 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, 1 tablespoon honey, ¼ teaspoon each of cloves, cinnamon, and ginger, and 4 ounces of bourbon. Mix the butter and spices until fully combined. Simmer the cider in a saucepan over low heat, and whisk in the butter mixture until it is fully melted.
Remove the pan from the heat and whisk in the bourbon. Split the beverage into two portions and serve while still they are still steaming.

, For a punch bowl’s worth of servings, try a recipe that uses 3 cups apple brandy, 7 tablespoons brown sugar, ¾ stick butter, 12 cups unfiltered apple cider, and ¾ cup fresh lemon juice. Bring the brandy, brown sugar, and butter to simmer over medium heat, stirring until fully blended. Add the cider, lemon juice, and 12 cinnamon sticks and bring to a brief boil.Serve in a large bowl with a ladle. Make sure everyone knows that there’s alcohol in the beverage, and encourage everyone to make sure they get a cinnamon stick.

Garnish with flavor-enhancing spices.,
Include additional ingredients.,
Add a salt rim.",How to Make Hot Buttered Cider3," Aside from the all but mandatory cinnamon sticks, there are several other spices that you can use to enhance your enjoyment of hot buttered cider. Whole cloves and grated nutmeg are especially aromatic. Dried anise seeds are another good option., Feel free to be as creative as you want with the recipe. There are all sorts of potentially enjoyable additions you can make. For instance, for a sweeter beverage, mix in a bit of maple syrup. For a batch with a citrus kick, zest lemon into your batch just before serving.

, Especially if you make a sweeter batch of hot buttered cider, such as a rum cider with maple syrup, a salt rim can add another level of flavor and visual appeal. Rub a lemon slice upon the rim of the glasses you'll use and dip the edges in salt."

Remove the foil from the wine bottle's neck.,
Wipe down the bottle's opening with a clean cloth.,
Prepare the wine glass for pouring.,
Pour the wine into the glass.,
Wipe the neck of the wine bottle again.,
Finished.

",How to Pour a Glass of Wine," This is an often overlooked step in pouring wine, and is not essential. However, some foil covers contain lead, which can leach into the wine in tiny amounts if the wine is allowed to contact it during the pour. Removing the foil cover can also prevent unsightly drips.


Aim to cut the foil cover about half an inch (1 cm) below the bottle's lip. This will ensure the wine does not contact the foil while you pour.
The foil is most easily cut using a special tool called a foil cutter, which allows you to pinch the bottle's neck and rotate a blade cleanly around the foil. Waiter-style corkscrews also contain small blades for cutting the foil away.;
, This step is also not crucial for serving wine, but is a good way to be considerate to your guests. Wiping down the bottle's opening will remove any cork debris or other dust and prevent this dust from entering the stream of wine while pouring.

, Wine glasses are best stored upside-down or in an enclosed space to prevent dust from accumulating in the bowl. Even so, you should hold each wine glass up to a light and buff away any visible smudges with a clean cloth before serving. This will allow the wine to be viewed clearly, which is an integral part of evaluating its quality.

, Cradling the wine bottle with both hands, carefully pour about 4 or 5 ounces of wine into the glass. You should leave the glass sitting on the table when pouring. Twisting the wine bottle gently towards the end of the pour will help prevent the last bit of wine from dripping down the bottle.


When pouring, aim for a ""fall"" - the distance from the bottle's lip to the bottom of the wine glass's bowl - of about 6 to 10 inches (15 - 25 cm). This distance allows to wine to aerate a bit during the pour, which improves the flavor by softening the presence of the wine's tannins.

, When you have finished pouring the wine, give the bottle's opening another quick wipe with a clean cloth. This will prevent any remaining wine from drying on the bottle's lip and tainting the next pour.

Choose dark chocolate for a more intense flavor.,
Pick milk chocolate for a sweeter flavor and creamy texture.,
Select white chocolate for the sweetest flavor.,
Try chocolate with fruit, nuts, or other additives.,
Give inexpensive chocolate treats a chance.",How to Pair Wine and Chocolate1," Dark chocolate is composed of 35-70+% chocolate (liquor and cocoa butter). The higher the percentage of chocolate, the more bitter the chocolate will taste.The intensity of dark chocolate can be overwhelming when combined with wine, especially if the wine is dry or bitter.
If you’re interested in getting the maximum health benefits out of your chocolate, dark chocolate is the way to go. It contains the highest concentrations of anti-oxidant flavanols.
The percentage of cocoa in the chocolate is usually listed on the label.;
, Milk chocolate usually contains a lower percentage of liquor than dark chocolate. However, the primary difference is that milk chocolate contains at least 12% milk solids, which are absent from dark chocolate. The milk powder gives milk chocolate its classic creamy taste and texture, along with a lighter color.If you crave the more bitter taste of dark chocolate along with the creamy goodness of milk chocolate, consider a “dark milk chocolate,” which can contain up to 42% chocolate liquor.

, White chocolate contains no chocolate liquor at all, which means that it is technically not a true chocolate. It is composed of cocoa butter, milk, and sweeteners. It is the sweetest and mildest of all the varieties of chocolate., For a more complex flavor and texture experience, choose chocolate that contains nuts or other additions, like sea salt, caramel, hazelnut liquor, or even red pepper. Fruit dipped in chocolate can also make an interesting pairing with wine., You don’t have to limit yourself to fancy, high-end chocolates to achieve a delicious and fun pairing. Consider pairing wine with a classic candy bar, chocolate kisses, or peanut butter cups."
"
Go for a sweet wine.,
Match the weight and texture of the wine with the chocolate.,
Try a fruity red wine with dark chocolate.,
Drink a sweet or dessert wine with milk chocolate.,
Pair white chocolate with a dessert wine.,
Pair the wine with other flavors in your chocolate.",How to Pair Wine and Chocolate2," If the chocolate is sweeter than the wine you select, the wine will taste acrid or bitter in contrast. Your wine should be at least as sweet as the chocolate you plan to pair with it. Look for a wine that is fruity and sweet rather than bitter and dry.For example, if you’re eating sweet chocolate, opt for a dessert wine like port, Madeira, or sweet sherry rather than a drier Pinot Noir.
Some white dessert wines work well with sweet chocolates, too. Moscato and ice wine are both good choices.

, In addition to the sweetness of the chocolate, consider how rich, heavy, or creamy it is. Select a wine that matches the weight and intensity of the dessert.For example, a simple, bittersweet chocolate bar might go well with a light, sparkling, fruity wine, like a Brachetto d’Aqui.
A rich and creamy piece of fudge or chocolate cake will pair well with a heavier, more syrupy fortified wine, like Banyuls or Maury.

, If you’re eating bitter dark chocolate, you can get away with a less sweet wine. The wine you select should be fruity, low in tannins, and not super dry or acidic.Some good options include warm climate Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, or Petit Syrah.
For a sweeter, heavier companion to your dark chocolate, try port.

, Milk chocolate is sweeter than dark chocolate, so it will go best with a sweeter wine. Try a sweet or semi-sweet wine, like Moscatel, PX Sherry, Port, Zinfandel, or Vino Santo., Since white chocolate is extremely sweet, it will taste best when paired with a very sweet wine. Ice wine, which is made by allowing the grapes to freeze on the vine before fermenting, is an especially popular pairing with white chocolate., If you’re eating chocolate mixed with fruit, nuts, caramel, or other flavors, take the additional flavors into account when selecting your wine. A good wine pairing will help bring out the other flavors in the chocolate. For example:Chocolate with peanuts pairs well with Banyuls, a syrupy dessert wine with a spicy strawberry flavor. Banyuls also goes well with desserts that include berries.Chocolate with caramel and sea salt pairs well with red wines that have berry, chocolate, or spicy notes. Try combining dark chocolate with caramel and salt with a Cabernet Sauvignon and Malbec blend."

Keep an open mind.,
Cleanse your palate.,
Smell before you taste.,
Taste the chocolate before sipping the wine.,
Sip the wine immediately after swallowing the chocolate.,
Take your time.",How to Pair Wine and Chocolate3," Remember that wine pairing guidelines are just that: guidelines. Although most wine connoisseurs wouldn’t recommend it, you might love the contrast of a super-sweet white chocolate with an ultra-dry red wine. The only way to know what you like is to try different things., To really appreciate the tastes of wine and chocolate together, use a simple palate cleanser to get any lingering flavors from dinner out of your mouth. Eat something with a neutral flavor, like a few bites of white bread, and drink a little water., Your sense of smell contributes a lot to what you taste. Inhaling the aroma of your food and drink first can help you appreciate the various flavors more fully. It can also build your anticipation by giving you a preview of what your taste buds are about to experience.Hold each piece of chocolate to your nose and take a moment to inhale deeply before you bite.
Before taking a sip of wine, swirl the glass gently, then take a series of quick, short sniffs from just above the top of the glass., Take a small bite of chocolate, and allow it to melt enough to coat the inside of your mouth. Close your eyes and concentrate on what you feel and taste. Make note of:The texture. Is it smooth and creamy? Does it have a crumbly or fudgy texture? If your chocolate contains nuts, sea salt, or bits of nougat, what do they contribute to the texture?
The flavor. Is it bitter, sweet, or both? Are there fruity or salty notes? Do you detect hints of almond or hazelnut?

, Take a quick sniff of the wine, then take a sip while the taste of the chocolate is still lingering in your mouth. Pay attention to the feel and taste of the wine, and think about how it mingles with the flavors of the chocolate.

For example, does the wine feel smooth, or crisp? Does the texture work well with the texture of the chocolate?
Do you notice any notes in the wine that complement the chocolate particularly well? For example, hints of berry can go particularly well with dark or milk chocolate.

, Allow yourself to be in the moment and savor the mingling of the flavors. Close your eyes and take a few moments to concentrate entirely on the taste of the chocolate and the wine. Wait a few moments between tastes to appreciate the aftertaste that lingers after you have swallowed both the chocolate and the wine."

Heat the bottles.,
Set the bottles aside on the kitchen counter to cool completely.,
Cork your batch.",How to Pasteurize Your Homemade Wine," As you use the wine bottles, wash them with soap, water, and a wine bottle brush; then rinse and invert them to dry.;
, When they're totally dry, wrap a small piece of aluminum foil over each bottle opening to keep anything from getting inside the bottles.

, When you have a couple of dozen of these cleaned bottles, put them in a cold oven, standing upright; then set the oven to 248°F (120°C), when the oven reaches 248°F (120°C), set a timer for 30 minutes; after 30 minutes shut the oven off and let the bottles cool in the oven overnight, with the door shut.


Wine bottles are made of soda-lime-silica glass, not borosilicate glass, like Pyrex; therefore, if you take them out while hot, they can break due to thermal shock.

, When the bottles have cooled, put them into a case box (stored upright with the foil still over the top of each bottle) and close the flaps. They remain sterile indefinitely (as long as the foil remains in place) and are ready to go when you need them.

, Remove the aluminum foil from the bottle.

, Using a funnel, or siphoning tube, fill the bottle with wine until the wine level is just above where the neck starts, and then put the aluminum foil back on.

, Once the bottles are filled, the next step is to pasteurize the wine in order to completely stop fermentation (if fermentation is not stopped, then the yeast will continue to produce gases that will increase the internal pressure of the bottle and can make the bottles explode during storage).

,,, The water level doesn’t have to be above the wine level in the bottles, but it should be as high as you can get it safely without it boiling out of the pot.

,, Heat the water until the temperature inside the bottle reaches 165 °F (74 °C). This temperature kills the yeast; this temperature also kills harmful bacteria such as Salmonella, Listeria, and E. coli.


Once the temperature reaches 165 °F (74 °C), hold it at this temperature for 15 seconds, then immediately remove the bottles.
Use oven mitts on both hands and grab each bottle, with a tight grip, by the neck with one hand (not the foil, which could cause the bottle to slip out of your hand) and the bottom of the bottle with the other hand; be extremely cautious because the bottles are hot and slippery from the condensation and the wine is hot.

, Keep the foil still in place during this process.


Note: if pasteurizing multiple batches, you must pour out the heated water from the previous batch. Always start with cool water. Never put bottles into hot water or the glass will break; the bottle and the water must be heated together to prevent thermal shock.

, Once the bottles have cooled, remove the foil from one bottle and cork it; repeat until all bottles are corked. Age some; drink some.

Plan ahead.If the approaching meal is especially important or if you feel remarkably nervous about making the right choice, choose the wine before you get to the restaurant.,

Learn from the experience.",How to Order Wine," Nowadays, most restaurants post their wine lists online, so you should be able to access it via your computer or smartphone.


Simply looking at the wine list early can help, even if you do not plan to make a selection ahead of time. Take a little time to research the wines offered to see which might appeal to you, and go with different foods on the menu. This way, you don't necessarily need to commit to buying a particular bottle of wine, but will be prepared to order wine to complement a variety of dishes.
If the wine list is not posted online, you can usually call in advance and ask for advice.
For especially important meals, you can usually pre-order the wine when you make your reservation. This can relieve an even greater amount of pressure and give you more time to focus on the company you're keeping instead of the wine.;
, If you are a wine novice and have no idea what to expect, keep in mind that wine can hit several different flavor notes: light and bright, earthy, big and concentrated, and fruity. When looking for a taste you might like or asking for advice, drop these keywords to narrow your search down.The most popular wines in the U.S. tend to be bold and fruity. Examples include Cabernet Sauvignon, Touriga Nacional, Shiraz or Syrah, Nero d'Avola, Monastrell, Zinfandel, Merlot, and Malbec.
Light and fruity wines can also be an appealing choice. Examples include Lambrusco, Primitivo, and Garnacha.
If you're looking for something aromatic and earthy, try Burgundy, Beaujolais, Blaufrankish, Zweigelt, Carmenere, Barbera, or Counoise.
For bold and earthy options, consider Cabernet Franc, Mourvedre, Bordeaux, Nebbiolo, Montepulciano, Sangiovese, Tempranillo, or Chianti.

, Taking your time does not make you look bad. On the contrary, when you make it a point to go over the wine list thoroughly, you actually appear more knowledgeable about what you're doing.

, When all else fails, remember the following guideline: white wine at lunch, red wine at dinner.


This is not a strict rule, of course, and you should opt for whichever type of wine appeals to your sense of taste no matter what time of day it is.
If you are ordering by the bottle, ask your lunch or dinner companions for their preferences before making a selection.
You can also look at the type of restaurant you're in or the type of food you anticipate eating to help you make your selection. As a general rule, white wines are preferred at seafood restaurants while red wines are more popular with entrees at a steak restaurant.

, Sometimes, a restaurant's wine list will weigh heavily on a certain type of wine. When this s the case, the owner usually cares more about the type the restaurant specializes in, and as a result, those wines are likely to be of a higher quality, so this part of the list should be the section you focus on.


For instance, if a wine list has two dozen local or domestic wines but only a handful of Italian or French wines, the domestic options are probably chosen with more care.

, Showcase wines are different from specialty wines. While a specialty wine is chosen with care and made special because of the attention it receives, a showcase wine is chosen simply because it is widely believed to be special.


These wines are easy to spot because they are generally the most expensive and might be labeled as ""first growth"" wines or something similar.
While showcase wines can be a little more extravagant, it is somewhat rare for the small boost in extravagance to justify the increased cost. As such, these wines are best avoided if you want to get the best value.

, There are benefits to either option. If you want to make the most of your experience, try something new instead of going with something safe and familiar. On the other hand, if you want to impress someone with a wine you know to be great or simply feel like treating yourself to an old favorite, a wine you already love might be your best bet for the night.

, Wines can be expensive. You should pick a price you are willing to pay before you even step into the restaurant and narrow the selection down based on that.


Note, however, that you may need to be flexible with this price point a little. If you set your price at $20 but cannot find anything decent on the list for that amount, bump it up to the next price category on the list. Be reasonable, though. You can bump up your price point by another $10 or so, but once you start doubling your original price point or going even higher than that, you're in trouble.

, After you have narrowed the list down as much as possible based on the extent of your knowledge, look at the options you have left. If there are more than two or three choices, knock a few down at random until you only have two or three options left.


If you are not sure about which wines will go with which foods, note that there are a few wine types that go well with nearly any meal. Along these lines, you can narrow your remaining selection down by choosing a Pinot Noir or sparkling wine.

, If you feel stuck and cannot choose between two or three options, call the waiter over and say, ""I can't decide between these wines."" Do not ask the waiter for a recommendation, however. Instead, ask, ""What can you tell me about these options?""


Oftentimes, the waiter will not know much about the wines, so he or she may just pick one at random when asked for a recommendation.
If your waiter is knowledgeable, asking for information will provide you with insight to help you choose. If your waiter does not know anything about the wines, he or she will likely fetch someone who does.

,


Avoid asking ""what should I try?"" without providing any guidance. Describe the wine style you typically prefer with as much detail as possible, or ask for similar suggestions based on wines you already know you enjoy.
If you are completely lost, let the sommelier know what food you plan on ordering. He or she should be able to recommend some choices that will work well with your meal.

, Sticking to a budget does not make you look bad. If you are asking the waiter or sommelier for guidance, you can come right out and specify the type of wine you are looking for and the upper value of your price range.


On the other hand, if you want to be discreet about your price range, you can point to an option on the wine list and say, ""I'm looking for something similar to this one."" To indicate that you are referring to the price, point to the price instead of the name of the wine. A good sommelier will catch your meaning and suggest other wines in that price range.

, Listen to the answers you are given, but do not rely on them entirely. You also need to watch for body language. Verbal answers will tell you facts about the wine, but body language will tell you which wines the person speaking to you feels most enthusiastic about.

, There reaches a point at which you simply need to make a decision. Factor everything you known into your choice, then take a leap of faith and just go with it.


Order by the glass when possible, especially if you are still nervous about your choice. Ordering by the glass will save you more money than ordering by the bottle, and you can always sample several different wines if your initial choice ends up being a dud.

, If you order a bottle of wine, the server will usually show you the bottle upon bringing it to your table. At this point, you simply need to verify that the wine in front of you is, in fact, the wine you ordered.


For older vintages, you should also inspect the condition of the wine. Check the fill level, the importer sticker, and the foil that covers the cork.

, The cork can tell you various things about the bottle of wine you hold in your hands, but sniffing the cork will tell you next to nothing.


When you order an older vintage, though, it is actually a good idea to inspect the cork. Check it over for any apparent damage. A damaged cork could impact the quality of the wine, especially if the wine has been in storage for a long time.
After the cork has been removed, you should check to see that the producer marked on the cork matches the producer marked on the label. Check the cork itself to see if any wine has seeped into the material.

, At most restaurants, you will be given a small sample from the bottle. Swirl the wine, then smell and taste the sample to check if the wine is in good condition or if it might be flawed. If the wine is in good shape, tell the server to pour it.A ""corked"" wine smells like wet cardboard. The taste tends to be fine, but the aroma is bad. It is usually the result of moldy, unclean corks.
A wine that is ""cooked"" or ""maderized"" has been stored in excess heat for an extended period of time. It will usually smell like an old, stewed jam, and upon tasting it, it will have a very flat, sour taste.
An ""oxidized"" wine is essentially wine that has turned to vinegar due to an improper seal. The smell and taste will be highly acidic. It might even smell like apple cider vinegar.

, A quick, gentle swirl that lasts for a few seconds will aerate the wine and draw out the right flavor notes. Swirling the wine for more than a few seconds will not do anyone any good, though, and it might make you look a bit pretentious.

, If a wine is spoiled, you can send it back. If it simply does not match your taste preferences, though, you need to keep it. Sending a wine back because you made a poor choice is considered to be highly impolite.

, If you want to try a second type, don't be afraid to do so after you have already enjoyed your first. This can be perfectly acceptable, especially if you are eating with a large group of people and will end up going through a few bottles, anyway.


This is also a great option if the restaurant lets you order by the glass instead of by the bottle. Ordering different types of wine by the glass can be a relatively affordable way to expand your knowledge base when it comes to wine and get the most out of your dining experience overall.

, As with any other area of knowledge, no one is born a wine expert. If you want to know what you are talking about when you order wine in the future, you have to endure the growing pains of ordering wine in the present.


If you want to gain more experience, go to wine tastings and festivals. You'll be able to learn a lot and get a good idea for what you actually enjoy. Then, when you need to order wine at a restaurant, you'll already have a good starting point.

Market your wine early in the production process.",How to Start a Vineyard," The first step is to do your research, and know exactly what you’re getting into. For the first several years of vine growth, you may see minimal or no fruit production, and during this time, the vines are vulnerable to a number pests, fungi and diseases. Growing healthy grapes is a huge time investment.


Visit or contact a local vineyard, and ask to spend time working the vineyard with them. This on the job training is one of the best ways to learn the ins and outs of successful grape growing specific to the area you want to grow in.;
, Motivation for growing grapes varies. Many people grow grapes for personal fruit consumption. Others choose to start a small vineyard to produce a few bottles of wine for themselves. You may want to produce grapes that will be sold to a local wine producer, or you may want to grow grapes to make your own wine for sale. You need to know what your goals are before you start planning and planting in order to make decisions about what types of grapes to grow, how many vines to plant, and how much money you'll need to finance your vineyard., You should be sure that grapes grow successfully in the area where you plan to start your vineyard. Get started by learning as much as you can about average temperatures, number of growing days in the season, frost and freeze days, and precipitation (rainfall). To get this information, contact your local agricultural governmental agency or outreach office to find out specifics for the area. They can also help you file necessary paperwork, if you wish to sell your grapes or wine after production.In the U.S., you can work directly with the United States Department of Agriculture or the National Institute of Food and Agriculture extension found here https://nifa.usda.gov/extension.
In Canada, you can work with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada at http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/home/?id=1395690825741.
In the UK, contact the Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board here http://www.ahdb.org.uk/.
Universities and colleges that offer programs in agriculture or horticulture are also great resources to find out more about climate.

, As a rule, all grapes do well in areas with warm summers, mild winters, no late freezes, and few chances for spring frost. They do best when temperatures stay above 60 degrees Fahrenheit (16 Celsius) at night and above 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 Celsius) during the day. Ideally, they take full sun with very little shade. However, you can find a variety of grape for almost any climate.A fairly complete listing of US grape varieties can be found through the National Grape Registry here http://www.ngr.ucdavis.edu/index.cfm?setdisclaimer=yes.
The Vitis International Variety Catalogue provides a searchable database of international grape varieties here http://www.vivc.de/index.php.
These listings also provide information on the number of necessary growing days, ideal temperatures, and planting regions., Originally recommended to deter destruction caused by phylloxera, an insect that damages vine roots, vines grafted to hardier root stock make it possible for vineyards to produce a greater variety of grapes in less-than-ideal climates. You can ask your nursery, local agricultural exchange, or other vineyard owners nearby for recommendations on whether or not to use grafted vines., Once you’ve decided what purpose your vineyard will serve and what types of grapes to grow, you’ll need to select the best growing location on your property. If you haven’t purchased property yet, you can incorporate the keys to selection into your property evaluation.


Grape plants do well on slopes because they help to properly drain the soil. Excessive moisture can lead to mildew, fungus, and rot that vines are prone to.
If you are starting a vineyard on a slope, keep in mind that southern facing slopes extend the growing season while those facing north shorten it because there is less sun exposure, Sep on which hemisphere you live in.
Where you place the grapes will impact the flavor of the wine. Soil content, weather conditions, and temperature change the flavor of grapes. This will make the flavor of wine from such grapes vary as well., You need to make sure the soil has a pH between 5.5 and 6.5 and no higher than 7. Vines, unlike other plants, actually struggle to produce fruits in soils that are too rich in nutrients. Water should not be left to sit in the soil around vine roots, so drainage is essential. It’s best to consult a professional to test your soil, but there are also a number of test kits available through nurseries.The Alcohol and tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau provides a listing of American Viticulture Areas that help vintners select sites for their wine growth based on flavors and reputation associated with specific growing regions. You can access this list here https://www.ttb.gov/appellation/us_by_ava.pdf.

, You’ll need about twenty pounds of fruit to produce one gallon of wine. Each variety of grapes produces a different amount, but typically, vines average about five pounds of grapes each season. Depending on the reason for your vine growth, you can use these average numbers to decide how many vines you’ll need.


Always plant a few additional vines to ensure you produce the desired amount. An extra vine for every ten gallons of wine is typically adequate.Use the equation 5X/20 = desired gallons of wine. “X” represents the number of vines you will need to plant to achieve a specific number of gallons of wine.
For example, 5X/20 = 100 gallons, so you’ll need 400 vines to produce 100 gallons of wine.

, You’ll need to allow for at least 6 feet between vineyard rows and at least 3 feet between plants. Because vines are prone to mildew and fungal growth, it’s essential to allow for adequate space between plants so the leaves don’t shade the neighboring vines. In most areas, running the vineyard on a downhill, southern facing slope, is ideal. However, in climates that regularly achieve temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (30 Celsius) you may want to choose a northern facing slope to protect grapes from extreme heat.Check with local land ordinance offices to make sure there are no regulations on land clearing before you get started. Many cities now require a specific number of trees per lot and other regulations. There are usually compromises like replacing trees that are cleared, but it’s best to know and plan for these situations in advance., Nurseries order or grow vines for the next planting season, so you’ll need to place an order one year in advance. It’s essential to specify only one year old vines will be accepted. Some nurseries attempt to sell two year old vines that were not ready for sale in their first year, which may indicate the vine is unhealthy or will not produce adequately.


Make sure the nursery you buy from provides certification for its plants and guarantees them against viruses and diseases for at least three years.
Inspect each vine before accepting the delivery. Look for signs of root or vine damage like breaks or circled roots.
Count the vines to ensure you’ve received the correct number., Once your vineyard is laid out, you’ll need to dig a hole for each vine. Using a posthole digger of six to eight inches in diameter, you’ll dig holes four to six inches deep. If the sides of the hole are “glazed,” compacted while digging leaving them with a smooth appearance, rough the sides of the hole with a spade or other tool to allow the roots to expand naturally., Prior to planting, you should have your entire support system in place. Training systems are necessary to direct the growth of your starter vines, and the trellis system supports the weight of fully-grown vines. These systems are essential because the vine cannot support the full weight of the fruit it produces. Trellises can be a simple series of wires, decorative fencing, or more decorative options, depending on your needs.


Fencing companies typically offer trellising services at minimal costs, and they have the experience to design and place a system that will support your vines.
Consult with a landscaper or nursery specialist if you would like to build your own trellis system.
In nature, grape vines grow on the sides of houses, along fence lines, and over other structures, so decorative trellises can be crafted from just about anything. Make sure your trellis system does not block sunlight from the vines., Be prepared to place your grape vines in the spring time. Most vines do best when planted after the last freeze and when there is decreased chance for frost. Place each vine in the previously dug holes. Tie the vine to the training post to direct the growth toward the trellis., From the tiniest phylloxera insects that commonly infest grapevines to larger pests like rabbits, deer, gophers, and birds, vineyards are constantly under attack. There are a variety of natural and structural pest solutions as well as chemical pesticides available to help you control pest problems.


Consult with local winegrowers and your nursery to select pesticides that will discourage infestations without harming your grapes or wine. It’s important to ask for expert help to avoid damaging your crop.
Fence in your vines to discourage deer, raccoons, and other larger scavengers.
Use netting to deter birds from eating grapes.
Fill in rabbit and gopher holes with broken wine bottle shards to discourage these pests from digging near your vines.

, Before you undergo any large-scale business investment, you should have some idea how much capital you’ll need and when you will produce a profit. With vineyards, this is especially important because most vintners don’t see a profit for at least three years. Every crop is different, but you should plan to spend about $12,000 an acre for your first year of production. This is the start up year, and this cost includes all of your tools, equipment, pesticides, trellising, and the plants themselves. During the second year, this number decreases dramatically, typically costing between $1,200 and $1,500 an acre and even further in the third year and thereafter costing about $1,000 an acre.


Have a plan to finance these first years and set aside more money than you need.
You are more likely to suffer set backs and concerns in the first few years that will require additional funding., Are you going to sell them as fruit, sell them to winemakers, or produce your own wine for sale? Whatever your plan to recoup your investment, make connections and strategize early. You can visit local retailers yourself or sell you wine to businesses that promote and sell these products., Be frank, and don’t hesitate to ask for help with your business plan. Winemaking may be a competitive industry, but most vintners are happy to share their knowledge and experience with those who are interested in learning more about the industry. It never hurts to reach out and ask for help from the winemaking community in your area.


You can start by searching for local wineries and winemaker clubs or associations. Contact these organizations via email or phone and ask, if they’d be willing to talk to you about the process of growing grapes for wine.
You can start with something simple like, “I’m considering starting my own vineyard, and I wondered if you’d be willing to share some of your experiences with me.”
If you find a vineyard or vintner you admire, ask, “Would you be willing to let me work with you during harvest and wine production?” This hands on experience is often more informative than all your research and interviews combined., If you’re planning to sell wine, you’ll need to go through any licensing, sales regulations, and tax applications required by your local regulatory agency. The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau handles these regulations in the US. The Canadian Association of Liquor Jurisdiction and the Business and Enterprise Department of Alcohol Licensing determine regulations in Canada and the UK respectively.


Ask other local wine producers about the process in your area. They are your best resource because they’ve been through it all before.
Conduct an online search for regulations in your state and country.
Read about liquor licensing to find out the specific steps to obtaining the licensing necessary to sell wine.

, Make contact with local retailers, call wine distributors, and consider setting a tasting room and shop on your property. This should all be part of your business plan, but make sure to start promoting your product long before you plan to sell it. You’ll be surprised how much red tape is required to get your bottle on local retailer’s shelves. In most states, you have to complete an application for approval through your regulatory board for each sales location.


Invite local retailers to visit your vineyard for a tour before the wine is ready for sale. Take them through your process. This build interest in your product. Then, invite them back for a tasting once the wine is available.
If you have a parcel of land within a specific American Viticulture Area, you can use this as a sales tool and resource, since each AVA has its own unique flavor attributes. This information is available through local Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade representatives.Offer local retailers one or more cases of wine from your first crop at a reduced cost to encourage purchase and sales.
Provide free tasting in retailer locations to encourage them to keep your wine on the shelf, once they’ve sold out of the original stock.

Debunk the myths.,
Set yourself a budget.,
Define your strategy.,
Ask yourself: can I afford this strategy?,
Look at the wine itself.,
Three crucial factors to bear in mind:


Not all wines are created to be aged.,
Determine which wine is age-able.,
Plan out your collection.,
Storing your wine.,
Your wine storage area should have the following attributes:


A cool, constant temperature: ideally between 50-55 degrees Fahrenheit (or 10-16 degrees Celsius) with minimal fluctuation.,
Know when to drink or sell your collection.",How to Start a Fine Wine Collection," There are some myths to debunk about fine wine collecting. Firstly, that it is just for the super wealthy - it isn't. It can also be flexibly adopted as a lifestyle, or merely a hobby, depending on how much time you wish to invest. Secondly, you don't need a large underground cellar. And, thirdly, you don't need to part with a large up-front investment.;
, Wine collecting is driven by passion and excitement - and can quickly get out of hand. So, to avoid finding yourself hunting for those great wines and forgetting the impact on your wallet, decide how much of your money to spend and stick to it.


At an average cost of $10 a bottle an average case of wine can be around $120. So, by buying one case a month you'd spend just under $1,500 a year or, at $30 the annual cost is $6,000, and so on.
Twelve cases a year isn't a bad target. This would give you 144 bottles overall, equaling a bottle to drink every three days or two bottles a week.

, You've determined your total spending, now figure out how and where you're going to spend it. This could reflect your drinking patterns. For instance, you may like one glass of wine during a night's meal. At four glasses per bottle, you will need about two bottles a week, or a case of wine a month.


Maybe factor your family and loved ones into the total, and any special events or family holidays. Let's assume there are an average of 12 major events in a year. For these, factor in another 24 ""special bottles"".

, Twenty-four cases of $10 per bottle wine are approximately $3,000. Another two cases of ""specialty"" wine at $20 per bottle will cost approximately $500. So, to support your buying strategy, you'll need about $3,500.


How does this compare with your budget? If you're over budget, then perhaps consider less costly wines, or simply fewer cases.

, Wine storage can be simple and hassle free... if you plan to drink your wine within six months. If not, you may want to invest in age-able wines which can be stored for many years.

, In fact, most wines are best drunk while young.
Improper storage will easily and likely ruin your wine.
Wine's value decreases after its prime time.

, Wine without much ""personality"" (i.e. lacking a strong structure and with no character to its taste) won't benefit at all from ageing. In fact, aging the wrong bottle is a bit like watering down a good bottle of wine with water.


Good, age-able wines are tannic, acidic, well-structured, and complex.

Tannins, the natural preservatives that come from the grape's skin, will soften as time passes. It will round up the wine, bringing out its best bouquet and balance.
Good, age-able wines include (from France) Medoc, Graves, St Emilion, Pomerol and Pommard, (from the US) Premium California Cabernet Sauvignon, and (from Australia) Penfolds Grange, among many others.

, The ideal wine collection should comprise a cross section of wines, some for long-aging and some for ready drinking. But how can you successfully collect and balance the two?


For starters, you've already determined how much wine you are looking to consume over the coming year, and how much money you can and are willing to spend.
Among lovers of fine wine, it isn't unusual for drinkers to develop three-season palates. In the summer, we go for light-bodied, refreshing wines and, in the winter, for more full-bodied reds.
So, why not buy your wine to match the seasons? About eight cases of light-bodied bottles for the summer, and 10 cases of full-bodied wines for the winter, and the rest somewhere between the two?

, Many would advise that, for a beginner collector, storage is best left to the professionals. However, here is some advice on storing it yourself. Wine, like any perishable food item, is sensitive to its surroundings. Fortunately, the alcohol in wine does act as a preservative. But heat and air and the natural enemies of wine. The quality of your wine's storage will affect its value.

, Try to stay below 68 degrees Fahrenheit. The warmer the temperature, the faster your wine will age. Temperature fluctuations can result in ""ullage"", meaning wine is lost as the liquid expands and contracts in the varying temperatures.
Moderate humidity: ideally 65-75%. The cork in the bottle requires this to maintain its seal and stay moist. Keep your bottles on their side, and avoid having them inverted.
No vibration: vibrations will break up the alcohol and acid chemical bonds - or Esters - which give aged wines their ""bottle bouquet.""
No light: wine is badly affected by UV rays (this is primarily why wine bottles are colored either green or brown, for minor protection). Therefore, store your wine in darkness.

, Wine's value drops after its ideal maturity, which differs for each grape and is affected by the wine's region or vintage.


A premium Bordeaux, for instance, may take 15 years to peak (or ""open up""), whereas a premium Burgundy (based on thin-skinned Pinot Noir grapes) can peak in eight years.
You can find out the recommended aging period from various online resources such as Wine Spectators and Robert Parker.
If you plan to sell your wine, you will get the best price one-to-three years before the recommended serving time.

Understand wine tasting.,
Take notes as you taste wine.,
Develop your wine vocabulary.,
Put it all together, mixing any memories or thoughts that you think might add to the descriptive quality of your text.

,
Tell a story.,
Make any recommendations, such as food pairings.,
Post or submit your story.",How to Write About Wine," This is sometimes referred to as the 5 ""S's"" of wine tasting: See, Swirl, Sniff, Sip and Savor. Wine writing is best when done by people who love and enjoy wine because a complex vocabulary develops slowly through appreciation.


Pour an inch (2.54 cm) of wine into a clear wine glass that is wider at the bottom than the top. Hold the glass by the stem.
If you are tasting more than 1 wine, start with heavy red wines and work toward lighter wines. This order will allow you to taste the complexities of wines with more sugar content as you move along.
See. Tilt your glass into light or sun. Judge if the color is cloudy, golden or another color. This can indicate how old the wine is.
Swirl. Hold the stem and swirl the wine gently for 15 seconds to aerate, or add bubbles to, the wine. Watch the ""legs"" of the wine. This is the remaining wine that trickles down after you stop swirling. You may want to write about the legs.
Sniff. Put your nose near the glass. You can hold it away or put it very close to the wine to pick up the aromas. Sniff for 30 seconds before tasting.
Sip. Take a small sip of wine and pay attention to the immediate taste.
Savor. Swirl the wine around your mouth from front to back and then side to side to hit different taste buds. You can also slurp the wine through pursed lips to aerate it further.;
, Since each step in the tasting process will evoke a different vocabulary, you will need to write down the information to remember what you have experienced.

, This should cover the color of the wine and its aroma, texture, taste and finish.


Describe the color. Touch on the obvious color like red, purple or yellow, but also describe if it's deep, medium or golden.
The aroma of the wine is sometimes referred to as the ""nose"" or the ""bouquet."" The nose picks up thousands of scents, so this is where you should be the most descriptive. Do some research on wine blogs about the common vocabulary, such as fruity, nutty, caramel, chocolate, pepper. These are sometimes called ""notes.""
Feel and describe the texture of the wine. More than the taste, this is the silky, rough, thick or heavy feel of the wine against your whole mouth.
Describe the taste of the wine as it hits your tongue. The taste of wine is usually qualified as salty, sweet, bitter and sour, along with any similarities to food or other wines. Taste, while important, is complimentary to smell because the nose is capable of picking up thousands of aromas.
Describe how long the taste lingers and if it leaves a specific aftertaste that's woody, earthy or another adjective. This is called the finish of the wine.

,, After you have made an impartial assessment of the taste of the wine, research where and how it was made. A personal story is an interesting lead-in to your tasting and it takes away a scientific tone toward the tasting.

, Will you drink this wine again?

, Wine blogs are a very popular way to write about wine and some wine magazines take submissions.

Prepare a pen and notepad for taking notes.,
Read through the list of included aromas.,
Smell each aroma in turn.,
Try to identify each wine aroma.,
Begin smelling and tasting wines.,
Keep your tasting notes in mind during future wine tastings.",How to Use a Wine Bouquet Kit," The whole point of a wine bouquet kit is to get you thinking about past wines you've tasted and making associations between different flavor notes. To record these thoughts, have a pen and notepad handy. You can take notes at any point during the process and record any wine-related observation that occurs to you.;
, A wine bouquet kit should include a list of aromas or a set of cards that have tasting notes for each aroma. Reading through this list will give you an idea of what you will be smelling. Aromas will vary from fruity notes like peach, apple, and currant to spicier notes like vanilla, cedar, and even tobacco.

, Open the first small bottle of aroma and waft the scent gently towards your nose. Think about whether or not you enjoy the scent and about which wines you have tasted before that the scent reminds you of. Take notes if anything comes to mind. Smell each bottle of aroma in turn, taking notes as you go.

, After smelling each bottle in turn, mix them together and open them again without looking at the label. This time around, try to identify each scent by relying on your previous notes and observations. Being able to identify each scent when presented alone will help you to pick out aroma notes when tasting a wine.

, Open a bottle of wine with a lot of character - maybe a big, spicy Zinfandel or a buttery, woody Chardonnay. Pour the wine into your glass, swirling and smelling its aroma. Try to identify the individual aromas in the wine, continuing to take notes.


Remember that aroma and taste are both aspect's of a wine's flavor, so don't be afraid to take a few gulps of each wine. See if you can determine which aroma notes carry through the wine's taste and finish.
Continue this process with as many wines as desired, noting of course that having friends and family around will help avoid letting the opened wine turn dull before consumption.
Look for parallels between different wines. Perhaps you will be surprised to find an aroma of fresh strawberries appearing in both a young Rosé and a Pinot Noir.

, After having built some experience identifying distinct aroma notes, make sure that you give each new wine you try a pause for contemplation before consumption. This will help build your ability to understand and appreciate a wine's complex and nuanced flavor profile and bouquet.

Place the filter over the aerator.,
Position your wine glass for pouring.,
Position the wine aerator over your glass.,
Pour the wine into the wine aerator.",How to Use a Wine Aerator1," The filter will prevent sediment and bits of cork from falling into the aerator (and from there, into your glass). The filter should clip directly onto the top of your aerator and fit snugly within the open recess., After selecting a wine and the appropriate wine glass, position the glass on a flat surface. You may not have a free hand, depending on your aerator's design, so ensure that the wine glass is positioned steadily., Hold the aerator in such a way that you do not block the airholes. If air cannot flow freely through the aerator, your wine will not get aerated. Position the aerator’s spout just below the rim of the wine glass., After opening the bottle of wine, you can pour the liquid through the aerator. Continue to hold the aerator carefully above the wine glass with one hand while pouring from the bottle with your other hand. The aerator will have a large opening at the top designed for easy pouring, and a nozzle at the bottom through which the wine exits after being aerated.Do not fill the wine aerator too fast. The aerator’s chamber should never be more than half full as you pour.

"
"
Affix the aerator to the wine bottle.,
Pour your wine.,
Seal the wine bottle.",How to Use a Wine Aerator2," After uncorking your wine, snap the aerator pourer into place. Generally, you can do this by simply pushing one end carefully into the top of the wine bottle.You can usually identify which end of the wine aerator pourer snaps into the bottle by looking for a rubber nozzle with a series of rings around it. Push this end into the wine bottle.
You can identify the top of the wine aerator pourer by looking for a metal or plastic spout. Some aerator pourers feature narrow, straw-like extensions protruding from their tops.

, With the aerator pourer in place, position a wine glass on a flat, stable surface. Pour your desired volume of wine into the glass. Pour slowly, as the rate at which your wine comes out with an aerator pourer in place may be different than the rate at which you’re used to it coming out.Some aerator pourers require that you turn the bottle completely upside down in order to pour a glass. Others enable you to pour wine just as you would in the absence of an aerator pourer. If you find that your wine is not coming out of the bottle with the aerator pourer in place, continue tipping the bottle at a steeper angle until it does so., Some aerator pourers come coupled with a wine stopper or feature a twist-top mechanism. This enables you to avoid the hassle of attaching and then removing the aerator pourer each time you wish to have a glass of aerated wine. To use the wine stopper, push the pointed or narrower end into the aerator pourer when you’ve finished drinking.Some aerator pourers have a twist-operated stopper built into them. To use this, simply turn the aerator pourer (or some portion of it). You might have to turn the aerator pourer clockwise or counterclockwise. The wine will then be sealed just as it would be if it were corked.If your aerator pourer does not feature a stopper or twist-top mechanism, pull it out of the bottle and wash it according to manufacturer directions. Seal the bottle using the cork.

"
"
Assemble the aerator.,
Attach the automated aerator to the wine bottle.,
Place your glass beneath the spout at an angle.,
Dispense the wine from the automated aerator.,
Remove the automated aerator from the bottle.",How to Use a Wine Aerator3," Assembly directions will differ depending on what model of automated aerator you select. Generally, you’ll have to insert batteries and attach an aeration tube (a long, straw-like object) to the aerator head (the main portion of the automated aerator out of which the wine will actually come out)., Slip the long tube extending away from the head of the automated aerator into the wine bottle. Once the tube is completely inside the bottle, gently press down on the aerator head. The aerator head should be pushed down far enough that it is stable within the bottle.Some automated wine aerators might have a rubber seal attached to the inside of the area where the tube and the head meet. This seal will ensure that the aerator head remains firmly in place during use.

, The spout of the automated aerator is the portion that extends horizontally away from the aerator head. Bring your glass up toward the spout with one hand. Hold the glass at a slight angle so that the top tilts slightly toward the wine bottle. Position the spout just slightly below the rim of the glass.Do not place your wine glass beneath the spout on a flat surface. This could cause you to miss the glass or cause the wine to splash when dispensed from the automated wine aerator.

, When your glass is positioned properly, use your free hand to press the dispense button on the automated wine aerator. This button might be located on top or on the side of the automated aerator head. Release the button after the wine glass contains the volume of wine you wish to consume., Recork your wine. Without detaching it, rinse the automated wine aerator’s tube off at the sink under running water. Then, fill an empty wine bottle with water and place the aerator in it. Dispense water from the automated wine aerator for about three seconds.Remove the aerator from the bottle and wipe the tube off with a clean cloth.
Do not submerge your wine aerator in water or it will be ruined.

Perfect the art of opening a wine bottle.,
Learn about the wine you are serving and the temperature it should be.,
Find out which wines need to breathe oxygen to open up the aroma before serving.,
Opt to serve wine in a decanter.,
Select wine glasses depending on the type of wine you are serving.,
Don't serve a new wine in the same glass as an old wine.,
If serving directly to guests or customers:


Introduce the wine to the host (the person that ordered the wine) by presenting the wine with the label facing the host.",How to Serve Wines," There are many types of bottle openers on the market, so select the one that best suits you. Practice removing the cork effortlessly, without breaking it, and especially without dropping pieces of cork into the bottle.


Alternatively, purchase wine with screw caps. Easy as!;
, Different wines are best served at different temperatures. Where some wines are best chilled, others need to be served at room temperature for optimum enjoyment. Serving a wine at the wrong temperature can destroy the flavor and aroma, defeating the purpose of the winemaker.


Serve Champagne, sparkling wines, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, white Zinfandel, and other white wines at 35 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit (1.67 to 4.44 degrees Celsius). Chill for an hour and a half in a refrigerator. 20 minutes in an ice-water ice bucket would also suffice. Sweet dessert wines and dry sherry should be served in the same manner.
Vintage-dated Champagne, high-quality bubbly and barrel-aged wines should also be chilled an hour and half before serving, along with high quality, full-bodied barrel-fermented white wines like white Burgundy and Chardonnay. They should then be brought out 20 minutes before serving. Ideal serving temperature should be 55 degrees (12.78 degrees Celsius), or cellar temperature. This will enhance the mature characters of the vintage wines and the flavors of the quality wines.
Serve the majority of red wines at 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.33 degrees Celsius) or after 20 minutes of refrigeration.

, Not all wines benefit from breathing, however. For example, Bordeaux should breathe about an hour before serving. Most wines can be served as soon as you open the bottle.


When allowing a wine to breathe, pour it into a decanter or glass first, as wines cannot breathe well in a bottle.
Don't let the wine breathe too long, however, as this can dull the aroma and flavor.

, Not only are decanters aesthetically pleasing, but they improve the taste of the wine. Aged wines, specifically, benefit from being served in a decanter because it removes wine sediments and allows the wine to breathe.

, Remember that when you are serving a wine, you need to give it space.


There are different styles of glasses, specifically designed to highlight the distinct qualities of the wine. For example, the traditional wine glass has a large bowl shape. When filled only a quarter of the way, the space allows for it to be swirled and breathe oxygen.

, If you have finished a bottle of wine and have opened another, change the glass so that you don't lose the integrity of the wine flavor.

,
State the vineyard or brand of wine, the type of wine, and the vintage or year of the bottle. This is important to assure you have selected the correct wine.
When the guest approves the wine, open it and present the cork to the host by placing it in front of their wine glass or by handing it to the host. The cork can indicate that a wine is good or bad.
Pour a very small amount into the host's glass for the tasting and wait. If the host indicates that the wine is acceptable you do not pour more into the host's glass until everyone else is served.
While serving the wine you must keep the label facing the guest, and pour only one fourth of the glass or about 3 oz. Remember you can always pour more but it is very embarrassing to run out before everyone has a glass. Serving clockwise around the table with ladies first. The last glass to be poured is for the host.
If there are more than 5 guests it is proper to suggest two bottles.

Smell the wine.,
Taste the wine.,
Always test the wine before allowing it to be served to others.,
Avoid confusing corked wine with other problems.,
Understand how wine becomes corked.,
Learn what corked does not mean.,
Remember that it may not be the cork on the bottle that caused the contamination.",How to Tell if Wine Is Corked," If wine is corked, it will have an odor that you wouldn’t expect from a good wine. It may smell musty, or like dank towels, wet dog, wet cardboard or newspaper.Note that your first sniff is more reliable than later sniffs. Trust your first whiff!
Wine becomes corked when it is exposed to TCA or ""2,4,6-Trichloroanisole"", a naturally occurring compound that may be found in the cork of the wine bottle.;
, If the wine has only been exposed to a small amount of TCA, it may be difficult to decide for sure whether or not it is corked by smelling it alone. The taste of the wine will be dull and will not exhibit any fruit characteristics. Some people also describe corked wine as tasting astringent.A wine that is only slightly corked may lack aroma and have very little taste.
If you did taste it, and it is corked, the taste was probably quite unenjoyable. It may have even tasted reminiscent of paint thinner. Rinse your mouth out with water, and open up a new bottle.

, This allows the host to see if the wine is fit for consumption and prevents pouring the wine into many glasses before a discovery that the wine is not fit for drinking. Return your corked wine to the store you purchased it from for a replacement or a refund.


If you are in a restaurant and you purchase a bottle of wine, make sure the waiter allows you to taste the wine before serving any other guests at the table.

, If the wine seems a bit off to you, don’t just assume that it must be corked. There may be other culprits that have ruined the taste of your wine.Oxidized wine is wine that has been exposed to oxygen, which has caused the wine to taste flat and lifeless, and even a bit vinegary. If your wine tastes this way (think of the way a flat soda tastes in comparison to a fresh one, as the concept is similar), then there is a good chance that it has simply oxidized. The color of the wine (if it is white) will also have changed to a dull yellow or brownish color.
Maderized wine is wine that has been overheated, perhaps as a result of storage or during transport. This wine will taste reminiscent of almonds or candied fruits, and the cork may be pushed a bit out of the bottle. This occurs because of the expansion that occurs when the wine becomes too warm.
It is also possible that the wine has refermented. Although wine is a product of fermentation, sometimes excess yeast can interact with the wine once it is bottled, creating a fizzy taste.

, A corked wine is a wine that has come into contact with a cork that has “cork taint.” This occurs when a wine cork comes into contact with a chemical commonly known as TCA (2,4,6-Trichloroanisole).TCA forms when natural fungi present in corks comes into contact with certain chemicals found in sanitation and sterilization products used in wineries.

, Many people mistakenly believe that corked wine is just wine that has little bits of cork floating in the wine. This is not the case. Although it may be annoying, the wine is not ruined.If you find bits of cork floating in your wine, simply filter it out by pushing a coffee filter half way into your wine glass, and then slowly pour the wine through the filter. Make sure to use an unbleached filter, though, as bleached coffee filters may affect the flavor of your wine.

, Sometimes, you may come across a bottle of wine with a screw top, but it still tastes as though it is corked. In this case, the wine may have become contaminated in the barrel before it was bottled.


If this is the case, you should definitely take the wine back to the seller. If a winery has sold an entire batch of corked wine, then you should reconsider the quality of that wine.

Open the wine key.,
Twist the worm into the cork.,
Place the lever against the bottle.,
Rock and twist the cork to remove it.",How to Use a Corkscrew1," This type of tool has a couple of parts. You will see a long, metal spiral, called the “worm” and a flatter portion that serves as a lever when opening a bottle of wine. Depending on the model, your wine key may also have a short blade with you can use to cut through foil if a cork is covered in it.The spiral and lever parts will be folded into the wine key handle. Unfold them and your key is ready to use.;
, Poke the sharp tip of the worm slightly outside the center of the cork. Gently twist it clockwise until only one spiral of the worm shows. Usually, this will take about six and a half turns.Use the blade or the tip of the worm to cut away foil from the cork first, if necessary.

, The flat lever on the wine key will have two curved indentations on its sides. Position the lever so that these fit against the lip of the glass bottle, next to the cork. This will provide leverage to help you extract the cork., Use gentle side to side motions while pulling up on the handle of the wine key. You can pivot your hand on the lever portion of the wine key if you need more support as you pull. Remove the cork and enjoy!Use your other hand to hold the bottle in place as you pull the cork out.
Take your time. If you try to force the cork out, it may break before it is fully removed.
Remember to unscrew the cork from the worm, then fold your wine key closed and put it away when you are done.

Pick the right room your champagne storage.,
Insulate your storage room.,

Control the temperature in your storage room.,
Use a storage rack.,
Purchase a shelving unit.,
Add personal touches to your champagne storage room.,
Store an opened bottle in the refrigerator.,
Store your bottle in the correct position.,
Keep an inventory.,
Refrigerate champagne before serving it.,
Serve your champagne properly.",How to Store Champagne," Some homes are equipped with wine cellars for the specific purpose of storing wine such as champagne. If no wine cellar exists, use a cool, dark and dry space. A closet would work, or a cellar or basement with plenty of storage space.Try to keep the area you choose free of objects like toys. You don't want to trip over something and fall into the champagne bottles.
Keep clothes, or items you need to use every day, away from the champagne bottles as well. You don't want the storage area to be high-traffic, one where you are constantly shifting the bottles around, looking for a particular article.
Another thing to keep in mind is that you want to pick a room that has very little vibrations. If the storage room is near where children play, the vibrations caused by their running could shake the bottles, thereby changing the champagne's flavor, and possibly causing a bottle to break.;
, The room or closet should be well-insulated to protect it from excessive hot and cold temperatures, and moisture. Check with a local insulation professional before you begin to store champagne. They will be able to tell you what type of insulation a particular room uses, and whether or not it is best suited for the job.You will want to make sure that the insulation is sturdy, and at least 1 1/2 inches thick.
The insulation should also have a vapor barrier on either side. This will prevent excess moisture from damaging the champagne.
The flooring should also be hard, like wood or concrete (something other than carpet). Carpet lets in and holds onto too much moisture. In the off chance a bottle breaks, it will also be much easier to clean up the champagne off a hard surface.

, Exposed or open windows let in light which can raise the temperature of the room, and change the chemical makeup of your champagne. Windows should be covered at all times with thick curtains that can be pinned together. If you have blinds in your windows they should be closed as well. You should also look into purchasing double-paned thermal glass, which will help to keep out both humidity and light.You can use regular bobby pins or clothes pins. Either way, you will need to use enough of them to keep light out. Have enough so that you can place one every two inches.
Tinting your windows is also another great option to choose. For more information on tinting, you can visit http://www.tintworld.com/residential-services/.
When purchasing blinds, you should look for either wood, honeycomb, or roller shades. These three types of blinds are the best at blocking out unwanted light.

, Champagne needs to be stored between 50-75% humidity. As seasons begin to change, humidity levels rise and fall dramatically. It is critically important that your champagne remains at a constant level. You can purchase a humidifier at any local home improvement store.Your humidifier will have to be hooked up to your water system in order to consistently produce moisture. Be aware of this, as your water bill will rise when this system is hooked up.
Because the humidifier needs to be hooked to your water lines, it is best to call your nearest plumber or electrician. They will be able to give you the best advice as to where to position your humidifier in relation to your piping in a particular room.

, The ideal temperature for champagne storage is between 50 and 59 degrees Fahrenheit (10 to 15 degrees Celsius). Place a thermometer on the wall, close to the bottles so that the climate in the storage area can be checked and adjusted regularly. The more times you check the better, but you should at least check once a week.For a consistent temperature you will need to install a refrigeration unit for your storage room. You can buy either wall, ductless, or ducted units at your nearest home improvement store. For more information on the proper unit to buy, visit this link: https://www.winecellarinnovations.com/refrigeration.
The refrigeration unit will, by necessity, be connected to both your water and electrical lines. It is because of this fact that you should call both an electrician and a plumber to install the unit for you. They will be able to give you advice on where best to place the unit in your room.

, Redwood, metal and plastic champagne racks can be purchased in wine shops, furniture stores, or home improvement stores. The rack used for storage does not need to be fancy or pretty. It simply needs space cut out to hold bottles of champagne. As a general guide to go off of, a storage rack which is 10 feet (3 m). long X 8 ft. high X 2 ft. deep can hold about 125 bottles.For storing champagne bottles in separate cubicles, you will need 4 inch (10.2 cm) cubicles (slightly bigger than the standard size of champagne bottles).
Place the rack in the space dedicated to storing the champagne. Try to keep it on or near the floor, where temperatures are typically the coolest. Redwood is a particularly excellent selection as it is resistant to mildew, rot, fungi, and humidity.
You can buy wine racks online, and get them shipped disassembled in order to reduced shipping costs. If you wish to make your own, visit this link: How to Build Wine Racks


, This is different from a champagne storage rack. Shelving units are similar, if not the same as, regular shelves. They are simply more sturdy and thick as compared to normal shelving units. Shelving storage units are designed for bulk storage, if you were to store cases of champagne at a time.You can purchase regular shelving units, but they need to material used needs to be at least 2 inches (5.1 cm) thick. Your local home improvement store should have shelves designed for wine or champagne storage. They come already made, or disassembled for you to put together.
The best materials to use are metal or redwood. Redwood shelving has the added benefit of being resistant to mildew, humidity, fungi, etc.
Make sure that the shelves are not freestanding. The should be places on a wall, and secured with either screws or nails.

, This could mean any number of things, and all depends on how creative you are. You can add-on, or buy, slanted champagne racks. These help you to display particularly rare bottles you want to show off. You can use a wood carver to carve intricate designs in your wooden rack.You might want to add murals or artwork into the room, so that when you show it off it looks ""lived in.""How to Paint a Mural

, Invest in a high-quality metal stopper which will prevent air from reaching the contents of the bottle. Lay the bottle horizontally in the fridge which will maintain an evenness in tone and taste. Try to place it somewhere where it will not be bothered much.If you place it on a shelf which is constantly used, or a drawer that needs to be opened, this can stir the champagne and cause it to lose much its flavor.
Do not simply place the old cork back in. You cannot get it back to its original high-pressure stoppage point, and there is a high chance the increased air activity will affect your champagne in a negative way.

, Depending on how long you plan to store your bottle of champagne will change the position you store your bottle in. If you are only storing a champagne bottle for a month, you should keep it upright, in a cool place guarded from light. However, if you plan on storing your bottle for longer, perhaps years, you should store the bottle laying down.If you have a bottle that needs to be stored long-term, and therefore on its side, you can lay bottles on top of one another for more compact storage. On the other hand, short-term stored bottles will need to stand next to each other (never on top of one another).
If you have a larger sized bottle, it is best to store this for longer periods of time. The added time allows for a slower, more even maturation when it comes to the taste and quality of the champagne.

, It is important to know how much champagne is stored, and its shelf life. Make a list of what is stored and keep it accessible. You can print pre-made labels with standard champagne terms on them, or print blank labels to write on. Place each label near, underneath, or on top of each section of your storage unit.Keep one inventory list near the champagne, and one in a more convenient location, like the kitchen or your living room. This way you have one that that is always near the champagne, and one where you choose a bottle from for either a dinner or party.

, First, decide on the bottle you plan to serve at a dinner or party. Take the bottle and place it in your refrigerator for at least a couple hours before you plan to serve it. The goal is to get the champagne to drop in temperature, down to 40-45 degrees Fahrenheit.If you forgot to take the bottle out in time, simply place the bottle in your freezer for 15 minutes to cool it down. Do not wait any longer than that, otherwise the wine will freeze, and the bottle could shatter.
More vintage champagnes should be served at slightly warmer, at around 54-57 degrees Fahrenheit. Take 30 minutes off the refrigerated time, and 5 minutes off the frozen time. If the vintage wine is too cold, the coldness will overpower your tastebuds, rather than the expensive flavor and aroma you payed for.

, Open your bottle with a corkscrew, or your hand. Place a clean glass on the table. Grab the bottom of the bottle with your dominant hand, and place your dominant hand's thumb on the depression (the ""punt"") of the bottle. Balance the neck of the bottle on the edge of the glass which you should hold with your other hand.How to Open a Champagne BottleTilt the glass with your non-dominant hand. Gently let the champagne flow out, hitting the inner side of the glass.
Wait until the bubbles subside before you to continue to pour. This may take up to four or five small pours for any one glass of champagne.
Twist the bottle as you remove it away from the glass. Any one bottle of champagne should get about 5-6 glasses out of it.

Choose a wine decanter that can show off the wine well.,
Store the decanter properly.,
Avoid washing the wine decanter with detergent.",How to Use a Wine Decanter1," Like stemware, the ideal wine decanter should be made of smooth, thin, and clear glass. This allows you to observe the wine clearly in the vessel, which is a facet of learning to appreciate a wine's quality. Avoid using colored or overly decorative decanters that obscure the wine's appearance.;
, Your wine decanter should always be stored in an enclosed cupboard to keep it from accumulating dust. Before use, giving the decanter a quick rinse will help remove any musty odors acquired in storage. Rising with mineral water instead of tap water will help avoid any chlorine odor or taste.

, After each use, you will of course want to clean the decanter. Instead of using detergent, which can leave a residue along the inside of the decanter, clean the wine decanter by swirling a mixture of ice and coarse salt inside the vessel. Allow the decanter to air dry before the next use.

Choose your desired wine.,
Cool the bottle at a temperature range of 63 degrees Fahrenheit (17.2 degrees Celsius) to 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3 degrees Celsius).,
Properly aerate the wine.,
Decant the wine.,
Choose the proper glass.,
Pour the wine.",How to Serve Cabernet Sauvignon,"


When choosing a Cabernet Sauvignon, remember the phrase ""old before young."" You will find with age, the characteristics of the wine have mellowed and smoothed. Younger wines are generally sharper and may overpower foods they are meant to compliment.;
,


Many people make the mistake of either over chilling a Cabernet Sauvignon or letting it stand at room temperature. Room temperature is a proper term to use when referring to the serving temperature of a Cabernet Sauvignon, however there is a stark difference between room temperature in Florida and room temperature in Iceland.
A good guide to reaching the proper serving temperature for a Cabernet Sauvignon is to place the bottle in the refrigerator for 20 minutes or in an ice bucket for 5 minutes.

,


Aerating, or airing, the wine is the best way to open it up to its full flavor. This is the process of letting the air blend with the wine, which reduces the high carbon dioxide levels that may be present. It also removes the accompanying odor that can mask the true aroma.
Uncork the bottle and let it sit open for an hour.
Pour the wine into a wine decanter. The wider opening of a decanter allows aerating to occur faster.
A decanter is a container that is used to hold the wine after it has been decanted. Decanters are normally used as serving vessels for wine.

,


Decanting is the process of separating sediment from the wine. Contrary to popular belief, sediment does not always indicate a wine has gone bad.
Sediment in red wine is created over time by the breakdown of pigments and tannin within the wine. As time matures the wine, small amounts of these 2 compounds gradually settle at the bottom of the bottle.
Leave the wine bottle in an upright position for 24 to 36 hours prior to decanting.
As much as 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) of the bottle of wine may not be consumed due to sediment, depending on the age of the wine and the grapes used.

,


Bolder, more full-bodied and complex wines like the Cabernet Sauvignon benefit from a wine glass that is large, round and has a wide rim.
Hold the wine glass by its stem. This prevents the wine from warming due to the temperature of your hands.
Warming a wine above its desired serving temperature will yield unwanted and unpleasant characteristics within the wine. The alcohol in wine will give a sharpness to the taste if the wine is served above its optimal temperature.

,


Use a wine funnel with a filter. This helps with the aerating process and filters out the sediment from the Cabernet Sauvignon.
Stop pouring the wine at the widest part of the glass. This allows for optimal aeration and you can swirl the wine without spilling it.

Ensure the correct temperature.,
Select the proper vessels.,
Allow the wine to breathe.,
Decant your wine.,
Pour your wine properly.",How to Serve Merlot Wine1," Temperature is one of the environmental factors that can greatly affect the taste of your wine. If it is too cold, you can hardly taste the flavors. If it is too warm, the flavors will not taste sharp and defined.Merlot is best served at 60-65 degrees. You will likely need to take steps to ensure that you reach this temperature.
Although it might seem counter intuitive, you should chill your red wine, including Merlot. Store it at room temperature until near the time you wish to serve your wine.
To achieve the proper temperature, place the bottle in the refrigerator for about 45 minutes. Alternatively, you can place it in an ice bucket filled with half ice and half water for 10 minutes.
When the bottle is the right temperature, it should be slightly cool to the touch. Since most reds are not sold chilled, you will need to chill it at home.;
, If you are going to serve wine, you need to choose the proper glassware. Different wines require different types of glasses. Make sure you choose the right glasses to serve Merlot.When serving any wine, the glass should be plain and clear. Dyed or frosted glasses distort the color, which can be an important indicator of the age and flavor of the wine.
Make sure the glass has a large bowl. You should be able to offer a healthy pour of wine and still have enough room to swirl.
All wine glasses should have stems. This helps to keep your body temperature from affecting the temperature of the wine.
A Merlot glass should have a wide bowl with a slightly tapered mouth. The bowl should be able to easily hold 30 ml of liquid.

, Merlot is a great choice for a dinner party or an impromptu after work drink with a friend. You can easily keep several good bottles on hand. Just give yourself time to open the wine before serving.Merlot, and other wines, need to breathe before serving. This means they need to be opened and exposed to air.
Make sure to allow your Merlot to breathe for at least 20 minutes before serving. This allows the tannins time to soften.
You can let it breathe for up to an hour before serving. Letting Merlot breathe allows the flavors to develop.

, ""Decanting"" simply means that you are pouring your wine from the bottle into another receptacle. When you decant your Merlot, you are further allowing the wine to aerate and breathe. This can help enhance the flavor of the wine.You can find wine decanters in many shapes and sizes. Choose one that fits your taste and your budget.
Try shopping the housewares section at your favorite department store. Your decanter should be clear, plain glass.
Merlot should be decanted for approximately 2 hours. Make sure to allow yourself time for this process before serving.

, You will need your bottle of wine, the proper glassware, and a wine key. A wine key is a simple type of corkscrew. You have likely seen a server or bartender use a wine key. You can buy them at any liquor store and even most grocery stores.Stand to the right of your guest to pour wine. If you are serving from the bottle, make sure the label is facing your guest.
You can also serve your wine straight from the decanter. If you are having an informal dinner, it is perfectly fine to allow your guests to serve themselves.
Pour 4-5 ounces of wine in each glass. There should still be room to swirl the wine without it sloshing out of the bowl.

Lower the corkscrew’s levers.,
Place the center ring over the cork.,
Turn the center tab clockwise.,
Fold the levers back down.",How to Use a Corkscrew2," This type of corkscrew will have two long levers (the “wings”) positioned on the sides of a center ring. Inside the ring there will be a long metal spiral (the “worm”), controlled by a tab at the top that can be twisted. Start by lowering the wings toward the center ring. The worm should lower as well., The center ring will be just a little wider than the opening of a standard wine bottle, so it should fit easily. The wings should stay down.If the opening of your wine bottle is covered in foil, remove this first.

, The sharp tip of the worm will pierce the cork. As you turn the tab, the worm will continue to wind its way into the cork. Keep turning gently until the wings are raised all the way up toward the tab., Grasp the levers with one or both hands and gently lower them back towards the sides of the corkscrew and the bottle. As you push them down, the cork will start to come out like magic! If the cork doesn’t come quite all the way out, gently twist and rock it side to side until it is fully removed. Enjoy your wine!Use your free hand to hold the bottle in place if you have to pull the cork out at all.
Don’t forget to to unscrew the cork from the worm before putting your corkscrew away.

Open the corkscrew, if necessary.,
Slip the sheath into the handle if you are using a travel corkscrew.,
Screw the worm into the cork.,
Pull the cork out.",How to Use a Corkscrew3," The simplest corkscrews are “t” shaped, just a spiral metal “worm” with a handle attached at the top. Travel corkscrews, however have two parts: a worm with a plastic handle, capped by a sheath that narrows at one end. The sheath will pull away or unscrew to reveal the worm.The handles of some simple corkscrews will fold down against the worm. If yours is like this, just raise them upwards until the tool resembles a “t” shape.

, The plastic handle at the top of the worm should have a hole it it that is about the diameter of the handle. Slide the narrow end of the sheath into this hole, stopping when it no longer slides easily. The corkscrew should now be a “t” shape., Position the sharp tip of the worm just outside the center of the cork and gently twist it clockwise. Keep screwing it in until only the last turn of the worm sticks out of the cork., Grasp the “t” shaped handle, and slowly pull upwards to remove the cork. Gently pull, twist, and rock the cork from side to side until it comes all the way out. Then start pouring!Take your free hand and hold the bottle at the neck as you pull the cork out.
Unscrew the cork from the worm after removing it.
Remove the sheath from the hole and place it back over the worm when you are done if you are using a travel corkscrew.

Determine whether your wine could benefit from decanting.,
Pour the wine into the decanter.,
Pour wine from the decanter into each guest's glass.",How to Use a Wine Decanter2," If you are drinking a young, highly tannic wine such as a cabernet or syrah, set an hour or so aside to decant the wine. In fact, most young red wines will benefit from a period of decanting.


Decanting these young wines makes the tannins less abrasive in the wine's flavor, which generally results in a smoother, more nuanced flavor profile.
You can also decant white wines, although an ice bath may be required to keep the wine chilled appropriately. Never place a filled decanter into a refrigerator for chilling, as this will cause the wine to pick up unpleasant odors from neighboring foods.

, To begin decanting a young wine, simply pour the entire contents of the bottle into the mouth of the wine decanter. Allow the wine to breathe for at least 30 minutes before tasting. The wine's flavor will generally improve over the course of several hours.

, When pouring a decanted wine, consider pouring small portions of only 2 or 3 ounces (60 - 90 ml). This will allow you and your guests to refill their glasses often and observe the wine's progression in flavor as it decants.

"
"
Check your aged red wine for sediment.,
Pour the wine slowly into the decanter.,
Pour the wine from the decanter into each glass.",How to Use a Wine Decanter3," Red wines that have aged in the bottle for longer than about 8 years will typically begin forming sediment. This sediment is created when the wine's tannins begin breaking down and precipitating out of the wine. Minimally filtered wines may also have sediment consisting of dead yeast cells and grape residue.


Decanting an aged wine can help remove this sediment, which tastes unpleasantly bitter. If possible, allow the bottle of wine to stand upright for a day before serving so that the sediment settles to the bottom of the bottle.

, When pouring an aged wine, pour it is slowly and carefully as possible into the decanter. Keep a keen eye on the wine bottle's opening to check for any sediment. As soon as you see sediment starting to enter the stream of wine, stop pouring the wine and allow the remaining portion to remain in the bottle.


Holding a candle or flashlight underneath the wine bottle will help you to see the sediment approaching the neck of the bottle.

, The question of whether or not aged wines benefit from an aeration period in the decanter can be a controversial one. Generally, aged wines will not need their tannins softened as much as younger wines, and therefore can be poured sooner from the decanter into drinking glasses.
