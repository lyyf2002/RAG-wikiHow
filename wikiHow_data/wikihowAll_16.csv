Locate your PC muscle.,
Flex the PC muscle twenty times.,
Add ten really slow squeezes to each set.,
Clench your PC muscle longer and more.,
Do the PC tremble exercise.,
Do the PC stutter exercise.,
If you're a guy, do PC muscle exercises with an erection.,
Don't overexercise.,
Do PC muscle exercises with your partner.,
Do the PC squeeze with an erection.,
Do the blitz PC exercise.",How to Do PC Muscle Exercises," The pubococcygeus muscle forms the floor of the pelvic cavity and stretches like a hammock from the pubic bone to the bottom of the spine. Pretend that you are urinating, then try to stop the flow with a quick muscle contraction. That muscle you just used to stop the flow from the bladder is your PC muscle. Try to keep your stomach and thigh muscles relaxed and focus only on the PC muscle;
, Hold it for one or two seconds each time, then release. Repeat this three times a day, three to four times per week. Breathe normally during this exercise and try to avoid holding your breath.

, Take five seconds to slowly squeeze your PC as tight as you can. Now hold the tension for a full five seconds, if possible, and release gradually over the next five seconds.

, After about two weeks, you should be able to stretch your PC muscle easier and for longer durations. Like any muscle in the body, it responds to stimulus and grows with use. Next, try upping the length of the flex and go for more flexes.


Instead of a one or two second hold, try to clench your PC muscle for five to seven seconds.
Instead of twenty reps, three times a day, trying shooting for 50 reps, three times a day.
Once you get the hang of it, you’ll should learn how to clench your penis and anus sphincter muscle separately or at the same time.

, Start clenching your PC muscle very slowly. So slowly, in fact, that it takes you several minutes to work up to the point where you are fully clenching. Now that you are fully clenching, clench a little more and hold it there for 30 seconds, breathing slowly all the while. When you feel the burn, release and do 20 normal PC clenches. Perform this exercise at the end of your PC workouts for the day.

, All this is flexing your PC muscle in increments. Tighten your PC a bit by bit. Start off gently — hold the PC there for a little bit — then a bit more then ""gentle."" When you have stuttered your PC all the way up to a full clench, don't release the muscle fully; work gently back down, first releasing a little bit, then a bit more, and so on. Imagine that you are running up and down a staircase with your PC muscle.

, There are several PC muscle exercises you can perform as a male with an erection, and they mostly involve resistance training.


Place a small towel over your erect penis and lift the towel up by squeezing the PC muscles. Hold for 2-5 seconds, relax, and repeat 30 times.
Place your hand one or two inches above your erect penis. Clench your PC muscle to lift your erection up to your hand. Hold for 2-5 seconds, relax, and repeat 30 times.
Place your hand one or two inches above your erect penis again. Clench your PC muscle to lift your erection up to your hand. This time, gently push your hand down while you lift your penis up, creating resistance. Hold for 2-5 seconds, relax, and repeat 30 times.

, Combine any of the basic and intermediate exercises together, but only flex your PC muscles for 50 reps and 3 sets per day. Overstimulation can result in muscle fatigue.

, Doing PC exercises while having sex can be productive and fun. The male partner gets erect, penetrates the female, and the pair take turns doing PC muscle exercises — he flexes, then she flexes, and so on. Just make sure that your partner is as keen on doing exercise as you are.

, Massage your penis until you have an erection. Gradually massage your penis until you are at the brink of orgasm. Stop massaging immediately and start contracting your PC muscles. Once your erection begins to go flaccid, massage your penis until you are at the brink of orgasm again. Contract your PC muscles and repeat until your PC muscles are adequately worked.


If you accidentally orgasm during this exercise, your PC muscles probably aren't strong enough for advanced exercises yet. Focus on mastering the intermediate techniques before moving on to the advanced sets.

, This one is very hard to do, because it involves different clenching strengths and variable reps. Find yourself a spot where you'll feel comfortable for 10-20 minutes. Remember to breathe as you exercise.


Do 50 PC clenches as a warm-up.
Next, squeeze your PC muscle as tightly as you can, holding for 30 seconds.
Next, perform 100 PC clenches without resting. Clench for two seconds, relax for two seconds, and so on.
Next, try clenching your PC muscle as tightly as you can. Shoot for 1 minute of gut-wrenching clenching.
Rest for two minutes.
Next, do 50 5-second clenches where you slowly relax at the end. Your workout is finally finished!

Try the pause-squeeze method.,
Use self-help techniques.,
Change the position you have sex in.,
Go to counseling .,
Try topical anesthetics.",How to Control Premature Ejaculation1," If you and your partner are willing, you might try the pause-squeeze method for learning to delay ejaculation.Stimulate the penis without entering your partner. Notice when you are about to ejaculate.
Ask your partner to squeeze your penis at the place where the head meets the shaft. Your partner should squeeze for several seconds until the need to ejaculate lessens.
After 30 seconds, resume foreplay and repeat as necessary. This will help you to gain control and enable you to enter your partner without ejaculating immediately.
Another variation on the pause-squeeze method is the stop-go technique. This is the same as the pause-squeeze method, except that the partner does not squeeze the penis.;
, These are methods that you can do yourself that may help you to delay ejaculation:Masturbate before sex. If you plan to have sex later in the evening, try masturbating an hour or two before.
Use a thick condom that will reduce the amount of stimulation you get. This may make it take longer for you to climax. Avoid using condoms that are designed to increase your stimulation.
Breathe deeply right before you ejaculate. This can help you to stop the ejaculation reflex. It may also help to switch to thinking about something boring until the urge passes.

, If you are usually on top, consider switching to the bottom or changing to a position that will allow your partner to move off of you if you are about to ejaculate.Then resume sex once the urge to ejaculate has passed.

, You can do this either alone or with your partner. This can be helpful in dealing with:Performance anxiety or other stresses in your life. Sometimes if men are concerned about being able to get or keep an erection, they may develop a pattern of ejaculating too quickly.
A traumatic sexual experience when you were younger. Some psychologists believe that if your early sexual experiences included feeling guilty or a fear of being discovered, that you may have learned to ejaculate very quickly.If you and your partner are having problems in your relationship, this may be a contributing factor. This could be the case if the problem is new and did not happen in previous relationships. If this is the case, couples counseling may be helpful.

, These medications are available by prescription or as over-the-counter as sprays or creams. You put them on your penis before sex and they reduce the sensations you feel, helping to delay the climax. Some men, and occasionally their partners as well, have reported a temporary loss of sensitivity and reduced pleasure. Common ones include:Lidocaine
Prilocaine

Take a seat.,
Cover your crotch.,
Tuck your erection into your waistband.",How to End an Erection2," When you sit, the fabric of your pants naturally bunches up around your groin, making it harder for others to tell the bulge of an erection from a crease in your jeans. Sitting also allows you to obscure your groin with your legs. Pulling your legs together or crossing your legs makes an erection even harder to see. This tactic should give you time to let your erection shrink naturally.Sitting down also gives you more options for concealing your erection. If you're sitting at a table or a desk, for instance, you can pull your chair closer to cover your crotch. You can fold your hands in your lap.

, If your erection won't go away, try to buy time by subtly holding something in front of your groin. Try covering your lap with a book, a laptop, or a newspaper. If you're standing, try holding a bag, backpack, briefcase, coat, or newspaper about waist-high.Whatever you choose, be subtle. Hold the cover-up object as if everything is normal. Otherwise, you may simply draw added attention to the area you're trying to conceal.

, If your erection won't go away, try to quickly and discreetly adjust it by hand. Tuck the rigid shaft up into the waistband of your pants or underwear. This aligns your penis with the zipper or seam of your pants and makes an erection less noticeable.Use caution when wearing a tucked-in shirt or a shirt that doesn't reach all the way down to your waist. If your shirt rides up, you might accidentally expose yourself!
Be aware that while this technique will help hide your erection, the friction of the fabric may also inadvertently arouse you further.
Some people prefer tucking downward against one of the thighs. It is really just a question of personal preference and comfort.

Relieve your discomfort.,
Try a warm bath or light exercise.,
Urinate.,
Masturbate.",How to End an Erection3," Depending upon your situation, the tightness of your pants may be making your erection worse. Try discreetly loosening your pants. Sit down behind a table or desk and unbuckle your belt. If needed, unbutton and partially unzip your pants to give your erection more ""breathing room"" with less pressure.Be conscious of where you are. Don't be obvious. You don't want to be mistaken for some sort of pervert.
If you have a bit of privacy, applying a cold pack to your crotch (outside your clothing) can soothe discomfort and encourage your erection to dissipate as well.If you've ever been in a cold swimming pool or outside on a cold day in shorts, you know that the penis and testes tend to retract towards the warmth of your body.

, While taking a cold shower is often considered the way to ""cool off"" raging sexual desires, a warm bath can actually provide a soothing, comfortable environment that may bring your erection to a faster conclusion.Light exercise, like walking on a treadmill or simple aerobics, can also help provide distraction and a shift in blood distribution.
These alternatives are often used as initial efforts to end a possible case of priapism, in which the pooled blood becomes trapped in the shaft of the penis. If you have an erection that lasts for more than four hours for any reason, seek medical attention immediately. If not treated quickly, priapism can lead to permanent damage, including but not limited to erectile dysfunction.

, This may not be easy to do with an erection, but urinating can sometimes make an erection go away. Urination causes pleasant, relaxing feelings in your groin, which can make an erection feel less ""tight"" or ""urgent.""Waking up in the morning with an erection is common for men of all ages. It can occur with or without the prompting of sexually-arousing dreams. Despite the degree of difficulty in hitting your target while you have an erection, urinating can often help bring it to a conclusion quickly., When it comes down to it, the most effective way to end an erection is to bring it to its natural conclusion. Barring a medical condition, ejaculation almost invariably causes an erection to end.Discreetly excuse yourself from the situation and find a private area: a bathroom, a bedroom, or anywhere else you feel sure that you won't disturb anyone. Do your business, clean up, and return to the situation relieved and ready to go.
Avoid masturbating in public. If you do find yourself in a public place with an erection, find somewhere relatively private to do your thing. A lockable bathroom stall will do in a pinch, as long as you aren't loud or obvious about what you're doing. Public masturbation is illegal in many places, and you might disturb people if you aren't careful.

Go to a doctor if self help techniques didn’t work.,
Ask your doctor about Dapoxetine (Priligy).,
Talk to your doctor about other medications that delay orgasms.",How to Control Premature Ejaculation2," Sometimes premature ejaculation is a symptom of another underlying problem that needs to be treated. Possibilities include:Diabetes
High blood pressure
Alcohol or drug abuse
Multiple sclerosis
Prostate disease
Depression
A hormonal imbalance
Problems with your neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters are the chemicals that convey signals in your brain.
Abnormal reflexes in your ejaculatory system
A thyroid condition
An infection in your prostate or urethra
Damage from surgery or trauma. This is not common.
An inherited condition.

, This medication is similar to selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants, but it was created to treat premature ejaculation. It is a relatively new drug and is usually the first thing your doctor will try to treat this issue. If you are prescribed this medication, you will take it one to three hours before sex.Do not take it more than one time per day. It may cause side effects including headaches, dizziness, and feeling unwell.
It is not suitable for men with heart, liver, or kidney conditions. It may also interact with other medications, including other antidepressants.
Other options include the SSRI's paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, and citalopram.
The typical full effects of SSRIs (which are taken every day, not on-demand like Dapoxetine) are not seen until about two weeks after you begin use.

, These drugs have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in treating premature ejaculation, they are known to delay orgasms. Your doctor may prescribe them for you to take as needed or daily.Other antidepressants. Possibilities include other SSRIs such as sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac, Sarafem) or the tricyclic clomipramine (Anafranil). Side effects may include nausea, dry mouth, dizziness, and reduced interest in sex.
Tramadol (Ultram). This medication is used to combat pain. One of its side effects is that it can delay ejaculation. Other side effects include nausea, headaches, and lightheadedness.
Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. These medications are often used to treat erectile dysfunction. They include sildenafil (Viagra, Revatio), tadalafil (Cialis, Adcirca), and vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn). Side effects include headaches, flushing, vision changes and a stuffy nose.

Make sure the razor is turned off.,
Remove the cutting head.,
Brush away all traces of hair and other debris.,
Replace the cutting head.",How to Clean an Electric Razor1," Before you start cleaning, you’ll want to make sure that there’s no power going to the razor. Slide or press the power button to the “off” position and look for the power indicator display to go dark.It may be a good idea to unplug the razor entirely. You don’t want to accidentally switch it on while you’re trying to clean it!;
, The cutting head is the part of the razor that comes into contact with your face while shaving. This can usually be detached by simply pulling it straight off the frame, or by pressing a small latch on the front or back of the head. You’ll likely notice a lot of hair, skin particles and dust built up on both the inside and outside of the cutting head.Give the detached cutting head a light tap against the edge of your sink to remove hair clippings that have compacted inside. Just be careful not to damage the delicate blades or cutting foils, as these can easily be warped out of shape., Use a stiff-bristled brush to remove whatever loose matter is clinging to the cutting head. Most electric razors include a small brush specifically designed for light cleaning. If your razor didn’t come with such a brush, a cheap nail brush from your local pharmacy will also do the trick.Use smooth sweeping motions to dislodge debris without applying too much force to the cutting surface.If the cutting head of your razor is washable, run it under the faucet and dry it gently with a towel.

, Once you’ve brushed off as much debris as you can, snap the cutting head back into place on the end of the razor’s frame. Listen for it to click so you’ll know it’s secure. You can now return to using the razor as normal.

Make an effort to brush your razor’s cutting head clean each and every time you shave."

Power up the cleaning dock.,
Insert the razor into the dock head-first.,
Activate the cleaning cycle.,
Remove and store the razor.",How to Clean an Electric Razor2," Plug the exterior power cord into a wall outlet and wait for the unit’s power indicator light to come on. If your razor’s dock has a separate power switch, make sure to flip it into the “on” position.Many newer electric razors come equipped with a separate docking base that cleans and charges the razor automatically. This is the easiest way to keep your shaver cleaned and maintained.
Keep your razor’s dock at a safe distance from the sink or shower to prevent it from getting wet., Fit the the head of the razor carefully into the base of the dock. You’ll most likely hear a click or see a separate light that will let you know the razor has been attached successfully. With the razor in place, the dock can clean, polish, oil and dry the cutting head in just minutes with the push of a button.If your razor has a protective cap over the cutting head, be sure to remove it prior to docking.
Follow the instructions specified in the user’s manual if you’re unsure how to proceed., To begin, locate and push the button on the base that indicates the dock’s cleaning function. More advanced units may have several different cleaning options. In this case, you should select your preferred option.The different cleaning options will likely include a quick, normal and intensive setting. Each subsequent setting will offer a more thorough clean, but will also take longer to complete.In addition to cleaning the blades or foils, the dock will also typically apply a fresh coat of lubricating oil and rapidly dry the razor using an internal heat source.

, Wait for the dock to finish cleaning the razor. Then, take it out of the base and use your stiff-bristled brush to clear away any hairs or debris remaining on the outside of the razor. Replace the protective cap, if your model has one, and leave the razor in a clean, dry place until your next shave.

Your razor will be ready for use as soon as the automated cleaning cycle is complete.
Invest in an inexpensive storage bag or hard-shelled case for your razor to keep it from being exposed to moisture and other elements that could speed its deterioration.

"
"
Disassemble the razor.,
Rinse the individual components with hot, soapy water.,
Wipe down the outside of the razor.,
Allow the razor to dry before using it again.",How to Clean an Electric Razor3," Switch the razor to the “off” position and disconnect the power cord from the wall outlet. Remove the protective cap, snap off the cutting head and disconnect any other removable parts, such as an additional lubricating strip or length guard.Assuming you don’t own a self-cleaning model and it’s been awhile since the last time you gave your razor a thorough cleaning, your best bet will be to break the razor down and manually clean every accessible part.

, Add a few drops of mild liquid soap to a sinkful of hot water. Take a brush to the cutting head and other removable parts of the razor, then swish them through the soap solution to fully clean them. Afterwards, run each piece under a stream of hot water to rinse them.Cleaning the blades with soap will help cut through the congealed oil and skin residue that has a tendency to accumulate inside the cutting mechanisms.
Avoid getting any pieces that are directly connected to the battery or electrical input wet.

, Wet a washcloth with warm water and wring out the excess. Go over any parts of the razor that aren’t directly washable but might contain traces of hair and debris, like the edges of the frame and the collar that holds the cutting head in place. Immediately dry any standing moisture with a towel.Use a corner of the washcloth to scrub the edges of the frame beneath the cutting head.
Remove as much debris as possible. Any particles left behind could be pulled back into the blades once the cutting head is reattached.

, Pat each piece gently with a towel, then set them aside to finish air drying. This should only take about half an hour or so. You should not attempt to reassemble or turn on your razor until it has dried completely.Avoid using a hair dryer or any other artificial means to speed up the drying process. This may result in irreparable damage to your razor.

Determine the necessity of a screening based on your age.,
Note any symptoms associated with your urinary system.,
See your doctor.,
Request a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test.,
Consider having your doctor perform the exam.,
Assume the correct position.,
Inspect the area for any skin conditions.,
Put on a sterile glove.,
Lubricate the glove.,
Feel the walls of your rectum.,
Feel the wall of your rectum toward your belly button.,
Remove your finger.,
Contact your doctor.",How to Check Your Prostate," The American Cancer Society suggests a yearly prostate screening for all men age 50 and over. However, select circumstances may warrant screenings beginning at an earlier age. These include:Age 40 for men with more than one first-degree relative (son, brother, or father) who had prostate cancer before age 65.
Age 45 for men with a single first-degree relative who had prostate cancer before age 65.
Age 45 for African American men due to carrying a higher risk of prostate cancer.;
, Problems associated with your bladder, urethra, and penis can all potentially have ties to prostate problems. Due to the proximity of the prostate to these systems it can grow and press against them causing dysfunction. With prostate issues you may experience the following:Slow or weak urine streams
Difficulty urinating
Frequent urination at night
Burning urination
Blood in your urine
Difficulty getting an erection
Painful ejaculation
Lower back pain

, If you have any urinary symptoms, a variety of ailments may be responsible that a DRE alone cannot diagnose. Also, a DRE is just one of several tests your doctor may use to determine the health of your prostate.


Your doctor may order a trans rectal ultrasound (TRUS) to check for suspicious tissues inside of your rectum.
A biopsy may also be necessary to confirm or rule out cancer.

, Your doctor can order a laboratory test to check your PSA levels (a specific protein found in your prostate) in the event of prostate abnormalities. Most doctors conclude a PSA level of 4ng/ml or lower is considered normal.PSA levels can cause false positive or false negative results. The Unites States Preventive Task Force advises against prostate screening with PSA levels due to these risks.Ejaculation (recent sexual activity), prostate infection, digital rectal examination, and bike riding (due to pressure on the prostate) can cause elevations of PSA. Those without prostate symptoms and elevated PSA may require repeat testing after two days.
Repeat elevated PSA levels may warrant a DRE and/or biopsy of the prostate (needle inserted to take a piece of the prostate tissue for analysis) if symptoms are present.
Men with a PSA of less than 2.5 ng/mL may only need to be retested every two years whereas screening should be done yearly if your PSA level is 2.5 ng/mL or higher., Though it may seem relatively simple to perform, prostate exams require proper technique and the ability to understand what you are feeling for.


Possible complications include bleeding due to nail punctures of cysts or other masses. This can lead to infection or other complications, which you cannot handle at home and would require a trip to your doctor regardless.
In addition, if your self exam is abnormal and you seek advice from your doctor, he will most likely repeat the exam to confirm the results anyway.

, Performed at your doctor’s office, your doctor would position you either lying down on your side with your knees up or standing leaning forward with your hips flexed. This gives the doctor easier access to your rectum and prostate., This will either require some handy work with a hand mirror or the assistance of a spouse or partner. Inspect your rectal area visually for any skin conditions, such as cysts, warts, or hemorrhoids., You or your partner should put on a sterile latex glove to perform the DRE. Ensure that you wash your hands before touching the glove to put it on. You will only use your index finger for the exam, but you should still wear gloves.


Ensure you have closely trimmed fingernails before washing your hands and putting on the glove. Even through the latex, you can accidentally scrape the area or puncture a cyst or other mass.

, A lubricant such as Vaseline or KY Jelly will allow easier, less stressful penetration into the rectum. Apply a liberal amount of the lubricant to the index finger of the glove.

, You or your partner will insert the index finger into your rectum. Turn the finger in a circular motion to feel for any bumps or lumps that could indicate cancer, tumors, or cysts along the walls of your rectum. If no abnormalities are present, the walls should be smooth with a consistent shape.Use gentle pressure.

, Your prostate lies above/in front of this portion of your rectal wall. Abnormal findings as you feel toward your prostate include firm, bumpy, non-smooth, enlarged, and/or tender areas., In a professional setting, the entire exam will take approximately ten seconds, so don’t spend too much time feeling around as it will only increase your discomfort with the exam.Dispose of the glove and remember to wash your hands again immediately.

, Make sure that you follow-up with your doctor for further tests and discussion. If you feel like your exam showed abnormalities, then you should make an appointment with your doctor right away. Remember to tell the physician that you administered a self exam if it’s been less than two days since this can result in an elevated PSA level on other tests.

Remember that puberty is normal.,
Prepare for your body to grow.,
Expect emotional changes.,
Be prepared for a new interest in sex.,
Pay more attention to hygiene.,
Begin shaving.,
Look forward to your voice breaking.,
Take pride.,
Adapt your lifestyle to prevent impotence.,
Practice resistance training.,
Prepare for baldness.,
Deal with wrinkles.,
Remember it is natural.",How to Cope With Your Maturing Body (Males)," You will be experiencing physical and emotional changes that might seem surprising to you. Don’t blame yourself if you begin to have emotions that you are uncomfortable with. These are normal; everyone goes through them, just at different times.Some boys can begin puberty before they turn 9, others around 12. It is normal to experience it at different times.;
, This is the period in which you are likely to grow the most rapidly. Expect your body, however, to have difficulty timing your eating habits with your growth patterns. It is common to go back and forth from being a bit pudgy to being stick thin, or anywhere in between. Your body will take some time to adapt to its changing shape.Expect to buy new clothes frequently. Buying clothes that are a bit baggier might save you some trips to the mall.
Your appetite will also pick up in ways that will surprise you. To support your growth you want to consume a lot of protein, calcium, folate, and zinc. Try to eat lean meats, beans, seafood, milk, cheese, yogurt, spinach, oranges, and whole wheat breads.Protein will also help encourage the muscle growth that you have begun to experience.
You will also experience some changes to your genitals. Your penis will grow longer and your testicles will both grow and begin to hang lower., Puberty unleashes hormones that make your emotions stronger, but also more erratic. You can go from being ecstatic to depressed for no real reason. The most important thing is to remember that this is normal. Reach out for help when you need to.


Expressing yourself can be a good way to get these emotions out and find some peace. Take up music, drawing, painting, or writing. Get a journal. Use your feelings as motivation to develop yourself.
You can also try to talk to people about your feelings. Talk to friends. Adults can also be a good source of guidance. Talk to your parents, school counselor, or doctor. Seek professional assistance if you experience emotional distress for several months in a row.Exercise can also help reduce stress., In a short period of time, you might transition from having no interest in sex, to thinking about it all the time. That is normal. It is also the case that some of the things we associate with sex are inevitable biological functions that really have little to do with our arousal.


Erections, for example, can occur because of changes in temperature; it isn’t necessarily the case that you are aroused when you get one. Similarly, nocturnal emissions also occur naturally when one is asleep.If you are uncomfortable with your feelings, try talking to someone older.Be cautious when entering into romantic relationships because you don't yet have a good grasp on your needs and feelings. Most adolescents want companionship, but many confuse that with sex.Wet dreams, also known as nocturnal emissions, can be particularly embarrassing. Don't worry: you have not peed the bed. You have ejaculated and this is your body's way of telling you that you are physically prepared to reproduce, much as periods do for women. Almost all men experience nocturnal emissions at some point., One effect of puberty is that you will begin to sweat more. You will start to smell worse, quicker. With oily skin, you are also likely to develop pimples. To prevent this, bathe or shower daily, paying close attention to cleaning all parts of your body.To prevent pimples, refrain from squeezing or scratching zits, using greasy hair products, and exposing yourself to intense sunlight. Use non-oily sunblock to protect yourself from the sun.
If you develop pimples, the drug store has many over the counter products to help eliminate them. If these don’t work, go to a dermatologist; she can prescribe something stronger.Your hormones will cause you to sweat and smell more than you are accustomed to. That is natural. It is not your fault. However, you can try to manage it by showering regularly, cleaning under your armpits, and using deodorant., You might find that you begin growing a beard or at least new body hair under your armpits or in your pubic area. At some point you will need to begin trimming and/or shaving this; even a good beard needs to be maintained. Consider starting out with an electric razor, because these will not cut you. If you can, have an adult teach you out to use a manual razor.Don't be afraid of your new hair. It is a natural part of becoming a man., As you grow, your vocal chords will begin to grow as well. Sometimes your voice will begin to give out and will crack into a high pitch sound. Don’t worry, in a few months this will stop and you will have a new, deeper, more grown up voice., You will experience some discomfort, but it is just a step toward being an adult. Everyone you know, including the people you look up to, have been through this at one point in time. Recognize that your struggles are the first step toward becoming a new person.


Make a list of things that you like about yourself and think about them anytime you are having doubts about your body.Surround yourself with positivity. Socialize with people who are positive. Consider avoiding people who talk about body issues all time. Avoid magazines and TV shows that focus on unrealistic standards of beauty.Exercise and eat well to keep yourself in good physical condition., Approximately 10% of men 40-70 suffer from severe erectile dysfunction (ED) and another 25% suffer from moderate erectile issues. By 70, 49% of men experience moderate to severe ED. In the the vast majority of cases, however, it is the result of preventable lifestyle choices.


Sedentary behavior, smoking, and alcohol consumption are major contributors to ED.Heart disease is also a major contributing factor. You should try to increase your ratio of “good” HDL cholesterol to “bad” LDL cholesterol. Lose weight, exercise, more and replace saturated fats in your diet with unsaturated fats like those in olive, peanut, and canola oil. Eat more nuts and fish, cut down on butter and cheese. Eliminate trans fats altogether.If you are still having issues with ED, talk to your doctor about medications that can improve your situation.

, Sarcopenia is a condition that makes it more difficult for men to both develop and retain muscle. Typically, men begin to experience this condition (and hence lose muscle) around the time that they turn 30. This muscle loss, however, can be slowed or halted with resistance training.


Use weights, or body weight exercises (like push-ups) that require you to strain your muscles to exhaustion. Try to progressively increase the amount of weight that you are using., About 3 out of 10 men show significant signs of balding by 30 and over half of men experience significant balding by 50. Typically, it is a slow process, that progresses steadily for a period of 15-25 years. There is no medical risk associated with balding and many men adapt to balding with simple stylistic changes, like shaving their heads.


Alternatively there are two medications, Finasteride and Minoxidil, which are known to either slow or reverse the process of balding. However, if you discontinue treatment the process of balding will resume rapidly.
There are also scalp surgeries that can disguise balding, however, they are expensive and results vary.
The most traditional option is to cover your head. Wigs can be used to create the appearance of hair, but they are often unconvincing. Hats can disguise the effects of balding without making it seem as if you are trying to trick anyone., Men and women both experience wrinkling skin as they age. This is inevitable, but it can be slowed. Sun is a major contributor to aging, so stay out of the sun for extended periods of time, or wear sunscreen when you are out. Beards can also help to protect your face from the elements.Refrain from washing your face more than once a day and apply moisturizer frequently to keep your face hydrated.Dietary changes that you can make to reduce wrinkles include, eating more soy, fish, chocolate, fruits, and vegetables. Similarly, you should cut out smoking.They don’t call it beauty sleep for nothing. More sleep will also help. Evidence suggests that sleeping on your back is particularly helpful for slowing the signs of aging., Becoming old is as inevitable as becoming an adult once was. Nor is it all bad. Men are often considered more attractive as they experience some of the signs of aging. One recent study found that men were considered to be most attractive at 34. Furthermore, age is often correlated to other fulfilling life developments.For example, the average man continues to earn more income per year until the age of 48.With greater wealth, emotional wisdom, and closer family connections, happiness tends to increase as we age. On average our happiness drops precipitously from 21 to 25. That process slows down until happiness starts to increase again by around 50. From 50 on, we grow progressively happier, ultimately happier than we were at the beginning of our adulthood."

Experiment with rye grass pollen.",How to Cope With Enlarged Prostate," Caffeine and alcohol are classified as diuretics, which means they affect the muscle tone of the bladder and stimulate the kidneys to produce urine. Since a primary symptom of BPH is increased urgency to urinate, you should avoid drinking caffeinated and alcoholic beverages, especially in the evening.Avoid alcohol and caffeine, especially after dinner.


Try not to drink any beverage with caffeine or alcohol within four hours of bedtime, and stop drinking all fluids about two hours prior to heading off to bed.
Caffeine is found in coffee, black tea, green tea, hot chocolate, colas, most soft drinks and virtually all energy drinks.
Caffeine also increases neuron activity in your brain, which can keep you up at night and acerbate the symptoms of BPH.;
, Many OTC cold and allergy medications, as well as sleep aids, contain antihistamines or other decongestants that can worsen BPH symptoms and trigger more trips to the bathroom.Other types of drugs can also negatively impact BPH symptoms, so review all your medications (OTC and prescriptions) with your doctor and/or pharmacist to be on the safe side.


Other problematic drugs include: high blood pressure (hypertension) medication, antispasmodics, antidepressants, and neurological drugs used to treat Parkinson’s disease.Your doctor might be able to adjust the dosages or change the schedule for problematic medications, or maybe prescribe different ones that cause fewer urinary problems.
Be aware that some drugs also contain caffeine or other diuretics/stimulants, so research the ingredients of all medications that you take.

, When urinating, particularly in the evening just prior to bedtime, take the time to completely empty your bladder because it will reduce the need for subsequent trips to the bathroom during the night.This isn't always easy to do with BPH and may take five to 10 minutes, but it helps to prevent sleep disturbance from having to get up every two to three hours.


To promote bladder emptying, try sitting down while urinating rather than standing up — it changes the angle of the urethra and can be more relaxing.
Other methods to help promote emptying your bladder include: running the water in the bathroom sink, distracting yourself with relaxing music and keeping yourself warm (by wearing slippers or a housecoat) if it's chilly.
Consider using the double-voiding technique: after your initial strong stream of urine comes out, wait a moment and then try again to see if more comes out., Taking a warm salt bath in the evening can help you cope with the symptoms of BPH in a variety of ways. The magnesium-rich Epsom salt and warm water can be soothing and combat stress, promote sleep, get rid of mild aches and pains, reduce muscle tension and potentially trigger urination.If you do feel the need to go, empty your bladder while in the bath for best results — don't worry, urine is sterile and great for moisturizing skin.


At least two cups of Epsom salts should be added to a warm bath for noticeable therapeutic results, but don't make the water too hot (to prevent scalding).
Don't soak in the bath for much more than 30 minutes because the salty water will pull fluid from your body and start to dehydrate you.

, Sitting around too much and being inactive is generally unhealthy, but the lack of circulation and pressure on the pelvis while sitting isn't good for the prostate gland either. Some research suggests that mild exercise, such as walking, may help reduce the symptoms of BPH.Exercising can also reduce stress and muscle tension, which are contributing factors that make it more difficult to urinate normally.


Although walking, hiking and swimming are great stress-relieving exercises that can benefit BPH sufferers, avoid cycling — the pressure from the seat can irritate the prostate and make BPH symptoms worse.
Lifting heavy weights and straining at the gym can make the symptoms of BPH worse in some men, so focus on less strenuous exercise.
Other exercises that may acerbate BPH symptoms include rowing and canoeing.

, Beta-sitosterol is a cholesterol-like compound found in a variety of plants. Research indicates that beta-sitosterol can significantly improve urinary flow and reduce the amount of residual urine left in the bladder in men with BPH.Researchers didn't find that it shrinks the prostate gland, just that it's able to combat the primary symptoms.


Suggested dosages of beta-sitosterol for BPH issues are between 60 to 130 mg per day for many weeks.
Beta-sitosterol is also used to lower blood cholesterol levels, which makes it a good option for men who have high cholesterol along with BPH. levels are high.
Pumpkin seeds are particularly rich in beta-sitosterol, which is why they are often recommended for men with prostate problems.

, Saw palmetto berries have been used for many generations to combat prostate gland problems, including BPH. Several (but not all) studies have concluded that saw palmetto extract can relieve BPH symptoms.The herbal extract works by preventing testosterone from being converted into dihydrotestosterone, which is needed by the male body for the prostate to grow.


Recommended dosage is at least 320 mg daily of an extract that's standardized to contain 85 – 95% fatty acids and sterols. It usually takes a few weeks to impact urinary symptoms.
Research indicates saw palmetto extract is as effective as some prostate medications, such as finasteride (Proscar) and has fewer side effects.
Saw palmetto is very popular in Europe (especially Germany) for treating BPH and other prostate conditions.

, Pygeum bark extract (African plum extract) is another old and time-proven remedy for prostate problems. Pygeum has been shown to be an effective treatment for BPH symptoms in men. It is particularly effective in combating nocturia (increased urination at night) and improving the flow of urine.It contains various phytosterols (including beta-sitosterols), which inhibit the production of prostaglandins (inflammatory compounds) in the prostate.


Pygeum, although originally discovered in Africa in the 1700s, has been used in Europe (particularly France) to treat BPH since the 1960s.
Recommended dosage is between 75 – 200 mg daily. It usually takes a few weeks or more to impact urinary symptoms caused by BPH.
Pygeum is available in various capsules, liquid extracts and powder forms, which means concentration and effectiveness varies according to manufacturer.

, Rye grass pollen (Secale cereal) is another herbal remedy for BPH that's backed by scientific evidence. More specifically, a couple of studies found that a standardized extract of rye grass pollen improved BPH symptoms, including reducing frequency of nighttime urination (nocturia) and the amount of residual urine left in the bladder.Grass pollen is also able to decrease the size of the prostate (as determined by ultrasound exams in men with BPH).


Do not use this remedy if you have allergies to grass pollens.
The studies on grass pollen are based on men taking the supplement for between four to six weeks, so don't expect immediate results.

Sleep on your side.",How to Alleviate Back Pain Naturally," A chiropractor is a specialist who treats neuromusculoskeletal conditions, primarily those that impact the back, neck and joints.A chiropractor will assess your condition and then will help align your spine naturally through a series of adjustments. This is usually painless and needs little or no medication.You may need to visit a chiropractor's office once or twice a week for 2-4 weeks.


Chiropractors hold a doctorate, completing a year graduate program, and must hold a license wherever they practice. Individuals are 28 times less likely to need surgery if they get treatment from a chiropractor rather than a surgeon.;
, Extremely thin needles are placed on specific points along the body that are thought to either open or control energy currents. Acupuncture has been used to treat pain, nausea, fibromyalgia and other conditions.It's been shown to be an effective treatment for chronic lower back pain.Acupuncture carries few risks, primarily soreness at the needle site. Licensed acupuncturists use sterile, single use needles, so the risk of infection is low.If you have a bleeding disorder, take a blood thinner, or have a pacemaker, make sure you let the acupuncturist know., Don't try to give yourself a massage. You may do further injury. Instead, find a trained and licensed massage therapist. During massage therapy, the therapist will use various degrees of pressure on areas of muscle pain and spasm. This pressure from fingers, hands, knuckles, or elbow will signal your muscles to relax.


Studies have shown that massage therapy can reduce low back pain and increase the range of motion and flexibility.It also gives pain relief, by increasing circulation, relaxing muscles, and increasing levels of natural pain relievers., This can reduce your low back pain while increasing your mobility. In this process, trained professional physical therapists manipulate your back, give you specific exercises to strengthen your back, and give you tips to prevent back pain as well as specific training on how to prevent back pain.Physical therapy works without medication or surgery.

, Many herbs have anti-inflammatory properties. Use the following herbs in cooking, as a tea, or as a supplement. If you supplement, follow the manufacturer's instructions. Try these herbs:


Willow bark
Basil
Calendula
Cardamon
Cinnamon
Turmeric: 400-600mg three times a day
Cloves
Ginger: 500-600mg twice a day

, Slowly mix ten tablespoons of bentonite clay with 20 tablespoons of room-temperature distilled water. Stir in 2 drops of essential oils or 1 teaspoon of anti-inflammatory herbs. The mixture will be the consistency of mud. Spread the mixture on a clean cotton cloth or towel so the mixture is ¼"" thick.


Make sure to leave room around the edges of the cotton cloth to make it easier to apply.

, Try applying the poultice cold or at room temperature to see which works best for you. Cover the poultice with a towel to keep it in place. Keep the poultice on for 30 minutes at a time, checking to make sure that the clay hasn’t dried. Remove the poultice before the clay dries to avoid drying out your skin. You can repeat the process and reapply the poultice for a total of two hours.


Before you try any of these on your sore back, test a small area of skin. Wait ten minutes and wash off the poultice. Check for a rash or any irritation. If there is no irritation, apply the poultice. If there is some irritation, try another herb.

, When you’re ready to stretch your back, make sure you’re wearing comfortable clothes that you can move easily in. This will enable you to stretch more readily and focus on the stretch. Talk to your doctor or therapist before exercising to relieve pain.


Stretching can prepare your back for a daily warm up or a specific activity. Stretching the muscles can actually help relieve tension that might be causing back pain.

, Relax the back muscles. Muscles can go into spasm resulting in back pain. You can help to prevent this by relaxing and then gently stretching your back. Repeat them up to three times a day.Try some of these stretches to target your upper back:Sit or stand tall. Squeeze your shoulder blades together as tightly as possible. Hold for 5-10 seconds and release.
Sit or stand tall. Place your hands behind your neck and gently arch your back backwards while looking up to the ceiling.
Sit tall in a chair. Cross your arms over your chest and twist your torso to one side and then to the other slowly and gently.

, Lie on your back and bring your knees up to your chest. Bend your head towards your knees. Hold this position for at least ten seconds, and then release. Repeat as necessary until the tension begins to subside. You can even try rocking from side to side, or from neck to buttocks. Remember to be gentle. Try these other stretches for additional relief:Child’s pose: Kneel and then sit back on your heels. Lower your upper body to the floor with your arms stretched straight out in front of you. Stretch the lower back.Two-knee twist: Lie flat on your back. Bring both knees up to your chest and then drop them both down to one side of your body. Stretch your arms straight out from your body. Release and repeat on the other side.

, Lie on your back with your arms stretched out to your sides. Bend one knee and slowly roll onto the side opposite the bent knee. Roll as far as you can while keeping both shoulders flat on the ground. Hold this position for at least 10 seconds then switch sides. Repeat this stretch, alternating sides 10 times on each side., Sit or stand tall with good posture. Bend your head forward to feel a stretch in the back of your neck. Then begin to rotate your head around in a circle, first bringing your chin to your chest, your left ear to your left shoulder and rotating your head around to bring your right ear to your right shoulder. Repeat., These can ease the pain and inflammation although studies are needed to show this.Acute pain usually does better with cold packs, while chronic pain often does better with hot packs.


To use a cold pack, wrap the ice pack in a towel and set it on your sore back for 10-15 minutes at a time. Repeat this 4-5 times a day. To use a heat pack, place a heating pad on your back and keep it on low for 20-30 minutes at a time.

, This means you should rest for as short a time as possible and carefully get moving as quickly as you can. Prolonged bed rest can actually make back pain worse and can lead to an increased risk of blood clots, depression and decreased muscle tone., Most of the time, over-the-counter medications are enough to relieve back pain. You might take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen. In severe cases, your doctor may prescribe opioids. These drugs should be used only for a short period and only under a physician’s supervision.


Avoid using NSAIDS over the long term since they can cause stomach and GI upset, ulcers, heartburn (acid reflux), diarrhoea, fluid retention, and in rare cases, kidney dysfunction and cardiovascular disease. Check for interactions with other medications before taking NSAIDS., Surgery can be used as a “treatment of last resort” for severe pain. These surgeries are not always successful, can involve a long recovery time, and may run the risk of permanent disability.But, several minimally invasive surgeries can correct physical problems of the spine.


Talk with your doctor about what options are available to you.

, The pain can be a dull, constant ache or can be a sudden, sharp and piercing pain. Back pain can be chronic (defined as lasting longer than 12 weeks), acute (lasting a few days to a few weeks) or subacute, lasting between 4-12 weeks. Most back pain is mechanical in nature, meaning that the muscles, vertebrae, facet joints in your spine, nerves and discs are not working as a unit anymore., Both men and women are at equal risk for back pain, but certain risk factors may increase your chances of experiencing back pain. These include:Age: back pain is more likely as you get older.
Level of physical fitness: intense bursts of physical activity could damage your back.
Weight: being overweight increases the risk of back pain.
Pregnancy: the weight of the growing baby and changes in pelvic structure put pregnant women at risk for back pain.
Family history: some disorders (like ankylosing spondylitis) have a genetic basis.
Occupation: jobs that require heavy lifting or heavy manual labour put you at higher risk.
Desk jobs: sitting in the same position without moving much can cause back pain.
Pre-existing mental health issues: depression, stress, and anxiety can worsen back pain.
Children’s backpacks: when overloaded or unevenly loaded, backpacks can injure a child's back.

, Most of the time, you can take care of a sore back with rest, a little home care, and some time. Make sure that you seek treatment if you are depressed. Chronic back pain is often accompanied by depression and depression can make back pain worse.You should see a physician immediately if you have back pain and any of the following symptoms:changes in bladder or bowel habits
fever
pain or throbbing in the abdomen
recently experienced a fall or other injury
intense, severe, and constant back pain (especially at night or when you lie down)
back pain that spreads down your legs and below the knees
numbness, weakness or tingling in your legs
unexplained weight loss
swelling or redness on your back
You are over 50, and this is the first time you have experienced significant back pain
You have a history of cancer, osteoporosis, or drug/alcohol abuse

, In general, a diagnosis will be based on your symptoms, history and a medical exam. You may also get some imaging done, like X-rays, MRIs, CTs or an ultrasound. Other tests may be more invasive. Some use a contrast dye that is injected into the spinal canal to see structural problems like herniated disc, fractures or spondylolisthesis.


There are no blood tests needed to diagnose back pain.

, Avoid lifting and bending as much as possible. If you do have to lift something heavy, test how heavy the load is first by trying to move it. If it seems too heavy, get some help, like a dolly, forklift, straps, handles, or another person's help before you try to lift it.Back belts are not really proven to prevent back injuries, so don’t rely on a one to protect yourself., The easiest stretch is to pretend you are reaching for something just a bit out of reach. Alternate, reaching with one hand and then the other. Do this ten times (five on each side). Then, slowly bend forward and bend backwards, five times each.Make sure to stretch your hamstring muscles well; these are the muscles at the back of your thigh.Lie down on your back and lift one leg up, supporting the knee with your hands or by looping a towel around the back of the knee. Pull back gently until you feel a good stretch. Hold for 10- 30 seconds. Repeat on the other leg.

, Set your feet about shoulder-width apart. Squat down close next to the object and grab it with a secure grip. Keep your back as straight as you can and slowly lift up using the muscles in your legs, abdomen, and buttocks. Make sure to keep the object between your shoulder and your body.Don't twist at your waist.


This way, you are not using your back as a lever. Instead, you're using it as a crane, with your legs doing most of the work. When you do lift something, lift by bending your knees and not by levering the weight with your back.

, Exercise regularly and make sure to strengthen your core and abdominal muscles. Crunches are a great way to keep your abdominal muscles in shape. Whatever exercise you choose to do, pace yourself. Be sure to take lots of small breaks between lifts and exercises.

, Keep your posture correct.Sit up straight and avoid hunching forward with your shoulders drooping. Use an ergonomic chair while you work. This will support your body’s overall posture. If you spend most of your day sitting, get up and walk every so often.


Use a lumbar pillow which helps maintain the natural curve in your back as you sit in a chair. It helps keep your spine in proper alignment. If you spend a lot of time in your car, it’s a good idea to use a lumbar pillow while you drive., This reduces strain on your back. Try out different mattresses for at least 10-15 minutes until you find one that supports your back and spine all along its natural curve.Some people prefer firm mattresses or adjustable beds.You might even try sleeping on your stomach to get back pain relief.


Place a pillow in between your knees if you’re resting on your side. This keeps the pressure off your back and can help keep the hips supported."

Having your partner provide support can make things easier for you.Do you need your partner’s help staying sober? Has your drug addiction impacted your health, finances, or well-being?;
, Learning that you have a drug addiction may be hard for your partner to hear. It may change the way your partner views you. Though it may not necessarily be negative, they will now know this vital part of you. This means that your relationship will change because of this new knowledge.Your partner may feel hurt or distrustful of you at first. They may need to work through negative emotions as they come to terms with your situation.
The relationship change does not need to be a negative thing. You and your partner may end up closer than ever due to this confession.

, As you prepare to tell your partner about your drug addiction, you should first be honest with yourself. Will your partner be supportive? This doesn’t mean they will support your drug habit, but support your recovery and your healing. This is important as you move forward with your life and your relationship.Ask yourself if you think your partner will be able to handle the fact that you have a drug addiction. Will they judge you and change their opinion about you? Will they support you as you continue through recovery?

, There may be a lot of information that goes along with your confession that you are a drug addict. You may not want to tell your partner everything at once. This may be overwhelming for both of you. Instead, decide what needs to be told at the beginning to let your partner know about your situation and your recovery.You may want to give basic details, like how long you used drugs and which drugs you used. You may want to save more specific details for later, once you have both moved forward and deepened the trust between the two of you.

, Though you love your partner and feel close enough to them to share your drug addiction, that doesn’t guarantee a positive reaction. Even if your partner loves you very much, they may still have a negative reaction.

Ask this question of the clinic: how often are both sides rejoined?",How to Choose a Vasectomy Reversal UK Clinic," You are looking for a surgeon who performs this detailed, specialist surgery on a very regular basis. A few operations a year does not mean that they are a specialist compared to someone who is performing many vasectomy reversals each week. Frequency and experience count.;
, Is he a fully qualified surgeon with surgical qualifications? Is he sited on the General Medical Council's specialist register? If not, then he/she is not a qualified surgeon.

, A specialist surgeon should have a dedicated website to vasectomy reversals. If there aren't any testimonials, ask yourself why aren't there? There should also an indication of whether the testimonials are up to date and there should be many of them. A good surgeon generates spontaneous testimonials. You are really looking at recommendations when you look at the testimonials so they are extremely valuable information.

, The cost is important. When cost is discussed it should be clear about what the price includes. Use this to compare to other clinics. You should find that prices are quite similar for surgeons who perform large numbers of vasectomy reversals.

, The waiting time should not be too long. You do not want to have to wait for an age once you have made the decision to have this procedure.

, If the testimonials are reporting them, then that is more proof that the surgeon is skilled at performing the vasectomy reversals.

, The success rate will never be 100% as a significant percentage of men do develop antibodies against their own sperm and it is not possible to identify these individuals. The success rate stipulated by a clinic, whilst important should not be held as a deciding factor, necessarily. What is the most important aspect of choice is ""other people's experiences"" before you. Do take note of those testimonials.

, The surgery can only be performed using a microscope. It might be tempting to go for a cheaper option whereby a microscope is not always used but this would be foolhardy to do so. The surgery involves stitching minute stitches into minute anatomy so it really cannot be done adequately without a microscope.

, The technique that matters is the one that works. This is why testimonials, and feedback from other sources speak volumes for the surgeon concerned. There is no gold standard or superior method: scientific research has found no difference between success rates and method but instead, science totally supports that the surgeon's skill is the key factor to look for.

, The answer you are looking for is that they should both be rejoined in one operation. Surgical skills of a qualified surgeon mean that you have a very high chance of both sides being rejoined. If the answer isn't on the website, then ask them.

Despite nodding out, she may attempt to continue conversations, or speak in a slurred voice.The person may seem confused. She may experience memory lapses.
The addicted person may demonstrate poor balance, and clumsiness. She will have less control of her physical body.
Frequent nosebleeds can occur when drugs are snorted or sniffed. You may notice a runny nose or rashes around the nose and mouth.
The person's eyes may be red and glazed.;
, Someone who is abusing prescription drugs may have abrupt changes in her appetite. She may eat rarely and lose a great deal of weight.If the person is abusing a stimulant drug, she may go for days without sleeping. When she does sleep, she may sleep for long periods of time.
Insomnia is a symptom of abuse of stimulants. It's also a side effect of withdrawal from many medications.

, The person's breath, skin, or clothing may emit a foul smell. The smell is a result of the chemical interaction between the person's body and the drug. If the person is trying to crush the pill and smoke it, it may be the odor of the smoke. The person may also sweat more than usual, which increases their body odor.The person's sense of smell may be either greatly enhanced or diminished.
The person using drugs is unlikely to notice her own change in smell.

, Drug use often results in physical clumsiness, awkward movement, or visual alternation. If you notice signs of unexplained injuries, this can be a sign of prescription drug abuse.Common injuries include mild cuts and bruises. Injuries may be more severe.
The person may become defensive when asked about injuries, or she may not remember how they occurred.
The person may wear long-sleeved shirts even in warm weather to hide marks from injections.

, You may notice the person's hand or arm shaking, or experiencing tremors. The person may have difficulty forming words. Her speech may be slurred.The person may have difficulty holding a pen, signing her name, or holding a cup without sloshing liquid over the edges.
Many times these signs are symptoms of withdrawal from medication, a sign of drug abuse.

, A person abusing drugs may stop taking care of her personal hygiene needs, i.e. taking showers, changing into clean clothes, grooming hair. This is a common sign of prescription drug abuse. The person may be less able to concentrate on these activities of daily living, or they may not care.If the person is using stimulant medication, they may spend more time than usual cleaning house, despite lack of personal hygiene.
The signs of drug abuse may mimic, or even stem from, depression that is associated with drug abuse.

, Many times people who abuse prescription drugs will start injecting the medication intravenously. Look for pouches used to carry syringes and spoons.You may notice piles of burnt matches, or extra lighters used to heat the drugs.
Foil, glassine envelopes or paper bundles may be found in the person's car, in between books on a shelf, or otherwise hidden in the person's home.

Ask your friends to talk.,
Pick a good time and place.,
Be direct and honest.,
Explain the extent of the problem.,
Say whether or not you’re still using.,
Consider an apology.",How to Tell Your Friends About Your Drug Addiction1," Admitting your drug addiction is a very hard thing to do. You might feel that your friends will think less of you or judge your behavior, but reaching out is still the right thing and a good step toward your recovery. Chances are that your friends already know, on some level, that things are wrong and want to help you.Remember that drug addiction is a mental health issue. Just talking to others can reduce your stress levels, improve your mood, and help get you concrete support.
Consider saying something like, “Hi guys, I want to talk to you about something very serious in my life. Do you have time to talk?”;
, You’ll want to set aside time either for a group or one-on-one discussion, since this is not a subject that you should hurry. Still, try to pick a moment when you are ready and your friends are not busy with work and won’t be distracted.This sort of conversation is also best in a private and calm setting and in-person, like at your or your friends’ home, as it may get emotional. However, a phone conversation can work, too, if you are unable or unwilling to go to see a friend.
Ask your friends is they are free, i.e. “Do you have some free time, an hour or two?” If your friends don’t have a block of time, put the ball in their court, i.e. “What time would work for you?”

, Your friends don’t necessarily need to know everything about your drug addiction. In fact, you have a right to decide what and how much to tell them. But you shouldn’t sugar-coat the problem. Be honest and open with them. That way, they will know where you stand and can help as best as they possibly can.Be upfront and tell your friends that you have an addiction, i.e. “James, I want you to know that I have a Percodan addiction,” or “Julia, I’m addicted to cocaine.”

, One way to impress the severity the problem for your friends is to explain and give concrete examples. This will make your addiction less abstract. Rather than being an “addiction,” they will get a sense of how drugs are affecting your life.You might say when your addiction started, i.e. “I’ve been taking pain killers ever since my back injury last year, but it’s getting out of control” or “At first, I was just having coke at parties. Then, once in a while for a pick-me-up. Now I can’t stop using it.”
You can mention scale, too, if you feel comfortable, i.e. “My original prescription was to take two tablets a day. Right now I’m taking one about every hour.” Or, “I’m using about $200 of cocaine every day.”

, Be honest about the situation, as well, and let your friends know if you are still using. Addicts overestimate how well they can conceal their addiction, so you may end up insulting your friends’ intelligence by lying about or downplaying your use.Be clear about your usage, i.e. “It’s pretty out of control. I’m still using every day.” If you’re attempting to get things under control, though, say so: “I’m trying to cut back and get clean. But I can’t do it on my own.”

, Addictions aren’t just about the addict. They affect everyone around the addict, including spouses, family members, and friends. You may have hurt or angered these loved ones in the past, either by hurtful words or by deeds like stealing. Recognize how you’ve wronged your friends and then apologize. This can start a process of reconciliation.

You might say something along the lines of, “Please forgive the mistakes I’ve made and the things I’ve done to hurt you” or “I’ve said and done things in the last few months that I’m ashamed about and have hurt you. I’m really sorry.”
Ask for understanding, though. Let your friends know that you love them and that you don’t want to hurt them, but that you’re dealing with an enormous problem: i.e. “Please don’t see this as who I am. This behavior is part of my addiction.”

Always remember that almost any product used in the home can be abused as an inhalant.,
Understand that alcohol and cigarettes are much more likely to be abused as drugs.,
Realize the extreme dangers of abusing inhalants.,
Try different things when thinking about abusing something as an inhalant.,
Get rid of the source entirely.,
Talk with a trusted person like a parent, friend, or legal guardian.,
Get into a group counseling program or one on one therapy.",How to Stop Using Inhalants," They have safe legal purposes but can be deadly if used incorrectly. Among them are whipped cream containers, toxic dry erase/permanent markers, paint, glues, and even bath salts. Then there are much worse ones such as gasoline, propane, freon and butane.;
, Therefore don't be surprised if almost none of your friends are engaging in this habit in order to seem ""cool"".

, You can die the first time or any time after in which you abuse an inhalant, as a result of sudden sniffing death syndrome. This is where your brain gets a message where it needs to somehow make much more oxygen than normal to keep you alive. Your veins will work the hardest to try to deliver oxygen filled blood to your heart but will eventually shut down suddenly.


Even if you do not die, the risk of irreversible damage to the brain, heart, kidneys, and lungs are inevitable. You can cut as much as twenty years or more off your life. Is this a chance you want to take?

, Do a common activity like learning to play an instrument, engaging in a conversation with a friend, or taking a bike ride. This will often keep your mind preoccupied with the task at hand so you can't think about other things.

, Dispose of the substances somewhere that is a distance from your house (for example, another neighbourhood's dumpster) to ensure that you won't be tempted to get it back out again. If this is too difficult for you, have a friend or family member dispose of the substance for you so you won't have trouble ""letting go"" or create excuses to change your mind.

, If they are mature enough, they will listen and offer to help discreetly without telling the whole world or freaking out.

, It's always better to have somebody such as a professional to help you with your problems and struggles with addiction. You can talk about these things with your therapist/counselor; What is it that makes you want to do this? A loss of a family member? Job loss? General dissatisfaction with life? Talking with someone is very helpful and will help you to keep you out of those dark moments and away from future temptations to use again.

Throw out all your pot and your smoking paraphernalia.,
Make your decision clear to your support system.,
Prepare for withdrawal.,
Find a replacement activity.,
Change your routine.,
Manage your urges.,
Stick with it.",How to Stop Smoking Pot/Weed1," If you remove the things that make it easy for you to start smoking again, you might be less likely to give in to your cravings. Here's what you should do:Get rid of any lighters, matches, roach clips, bongs, or containers. Empty out all of your pockets to make sure you didn't miss anything.
Flush any remaining weed down the toilet, so you can't simply dig it out of the trash later.
Destroy all of your supplies. Or, if you can't render them useless, throw them into a disgusting dumpster so you're not tempted to climb in and get them. (You might want to wrap them in a discreet trash bag first, though.)
Get rid of anything that even makes you want to smoke pot, whether it's your favorite video game or a poster in your room. This may sound extreme, but removing your triggers can help you beat your habit.
If you have a dealer, take his number out of your phone.;
, Tell trustworthy friends and family members what you're doing, and ask for their support in quitting. You'll probably find that they're thrilled to see you quit and support you however they can.


This is especially important if you want to remain close to people who are active smokers. Tell them that you're not trying to get them to quit, but you'd appreciate it if they don't pressure you into using. If you get no support from anyone or if they try to get you to ""join in"", consider whether that person really belongs in your life if he/she can't respect your choices and requests.
You may even have to avoid the friends that you smoke with for a while. If your entire social life with your friends consisted of getting high together, then you'll have to find a new social network. This may sound harsh, but that's the way it goes.

, The good news is it's temporary: marijuana withdrawal begins 1 day after you quit cold turkey, hits a peak after 2 or 3 days, and eventually levels off after 1 or 2 weeks. You might not experience any or all of them, but it's important to have a plan in place for what you'll do about them instead of going back to pot. The bad news is, there are symptoms. Here are some of the symptoms you may experience:



Sleeplessness: Try to avoid caffeine for the first few days, and hit the hay as soon as you're tired in the evening.
Decreased appetite: You might feel nauseated at first. Try to eat bland foods that are easy on the stomach, such as bananas, rice, toast, oatmeal and apples.

Irritability: As you experience the mood swings that accompany withdrawal, you might find yourself quick to anger or prone to crying. Plan for these ahead of time, and when they happen try to take a step back and acknowledge what's happening. Tell yourself, ""This isn't me, and this isn't the situation. It's the withdrawal."" Repeat it as often as you need to.

Anxiety: Feeling on-edge or generally out of sorts is a common symptom of withdrawal that can come with quitting any drug. When you have a spare minute, close your eyes, breathe deeply, and remember that withdrawal is only temporary.
Increased body temperature: you may feel hotter than normal and may start sweating from time to time.

, Instead of using, devote your new free time to a hobby or sport. Try to make it something you can do as quickly and easily as lighting up — such as playing guitar or going for a run — and turn to it whenever you're tempted. If you're feeling too bored or depressed to do this, watch a movie that makes you smile or spend some time with a good friend who is not a user. Here are some other things to try:


Taking long walks
Talking to an old friend on the phone
Swimming
Cooking
Reading the newspaper

, In addition to finding a new hobby, you should switch up your routine so that you don't start missing pot so badly during the time that you usually spent getting high. Here are some things you can do:Change your morning routine. Try getting up a little earlier or later, having something different for breakfast, or showering at a different time.
Change your work or school routine. Go to work or school by a different route, sit in a different seat if you can, and eat something different for lunch.
Change your study routine. If you normally study in your bedroom (which leads to smoking pot), mix it up and study at a coffee shop or a library.
Don't start eating less just to change up your routine, though. You may find that you're less hungry, but you should try to eat the same amount to stay healthy.

, You will have an urge, or a craving to smoke, pretty often, and it's important to know how to react to these if you really want to quit. Here are some things you can do to avoid giving in to the craving for pot:Avoid your trigger locations. Don't go to the places that make you want to smoke, whether its your friend's basement or the sop under your high school bleachers.
Flee the scene. Wherever you find yourself when you get an urge, get out as soon as you can. Changing your environment as quickly as you can is your best bet.
Breathe deeply. Take a deep breath through your mouth and hold the air in your lungs for 5-7 seconds until you feel more calm. Breathe it out through puckered lips, and repeat these steps until the feeling passes.
Put something else in your mouth. Finding a substitute for your craving -- as long as it's not alcohol or another drug -- can help curb it. Try sugarless gum, sugarless candy, a diet drink, toothpicks, a pen or pencil, or even a straw.
Drink water. Staying hydrated will keep you healthy and will help you battle your urges.

, The worst of the withdrawal should be over in a week or two, and we've all heard that saying about how it takes three weeks to make or break a habit. By the time a month's passed, you should be completely in the clear and free of your addiction. It might seem like an eternity while you're dealing with it, but try to remember that it's not that long.


Plan a small celebration a month from your quit date. Having a milestone to look forward to can help you stay on-track, and you can use it as an excuse for a small reward like a night out or a present to yourself.

Think about any changes in person's social network.,
Consider if the person is missing time at work or school.,
Notice increased level of secrecy.,
Pay attention to increase in troubling situations.,
Keep track of the person's spending.,
Listen for frequent requests for early refills.",How to Tell if Someone Is Abusing Prescription Drugs2," People who abuse drugs often avoid those who don't. You may notice that the person is avoiding former friends and coworkers, or developing new friendships with a different sort of person.There may be complaints from the person's former friends, supervisors, coworkers, teachers, etc.
Someone on stimulants is likely to talk a great deal, in a self-centered way. They may not be pleasant to be around.
They may start to become paranoid, and develop theories about how other people are against them.

, Someone abusing drugs is likely to show diminished interest in work or school. She may lie about attending, call in sick, or just stop going.This lack of interest may be very different from the way the person was before, or it may not be very different.
You may notice a drop in grades or work performance.

, Someone who is abusing drugs may seem paranoid, or just reclusive. She may try to keep anyone, particularly family members, from entering her room or home.She may take great pains to keep her activity secret from others, especially people who are close to her.
The person may lie about their daily activities.
You may notice the person engaging in suspicious activity that can't be explained.

, The person abusing drugs may find herself getting in trouble at school, home, work, friendships or relationships. This includes: accidents, fights, legal problems, arguments, and so on.Getting in trouble may be uncharacteristic of this person prior to abusing drugs, or it may not be uncharacteristic. If this is new, consider the possibility of drug abuse as a factor.
Sometimes, getting into trouble is sufficient reason for the person to stop abusing the drug.
If the person continues drug abuse despite repeated situations of getting in trouble, they are likely addicted and will need treatment in order to get off the drug.

, Someone abusing prescription drugs often finds herself meeting financial challenges to pay for the drugs. An unusual or unexplained need for money may be a sign of drug abuse. Someone abusing drugs may steal, lie or cheat in order to get money, even if they're otherwise considered an honest person.You may find yourself missing jewelry, computers or other items of high resale value. Someone who is abusing drugs may engage in theft to support her drug habit.
If the person seems to be spending a lot of money without anything to show for it, she may be spending the money on drugs.

, You can't get prescription drugs whenever you want, and a person abusing these drugs will run out before they are due for a refill. The person will have a myriad of reasons why she needs an early refill each month: they were stolen, they fell down the sink or in the toilet, forgot them in a hotel room, threw them away accidentally, and so on. This is a telltale sign of prescription drug abuse.

Consider changes in personality or mood.,
Observe emotional responses.,
Be aware of changes in the person's attention.",How to Tell if Someone Is Abusing Prescription Drugs3," Abrupt changes in a person's personality can be the result of prescription drugs. Someone abusing prescription drugs can become aloof or combative and argumentative. If this is a dramatic difference in the person's personality, consider the possibility that the person is abusing prescription drugs.On stimulants, the person may become talkative, but their conversation may be hard to follow. They may frequently change the subject, unable to stay focused on a topic for any length of time.
You may notice a person seeming paranoid, overly anxious about what other people say or do.

, The person may seem defensive or argumentative, even if this is uncharacteristic. They may become less able to deal with stress, more quick-tempered or sullen.Irritability is a common characteristic of someone with a prescription drug problem.
The person may appear less mature than before, refusing to accept blame for any situation or minimizing her part in it.

, Making poor decisions, a result of not being able to think through everyday problems, is a common side-effect of drug abuse. The person may be unable to think about things unrelated to the drug.You may notice the person being more obnoxious or silly than usual.Poor concentration and problems with memory are signs of drug abuse.

Tell the person.,
Don't expect the person to stop without help.,
Help the person access behavioral treatment.,
Share information about pharmacological treatment options.",How to Tell if Someone Is Abusing Prescription Drugs4," If you think that someone you know is abusing prescription drugs, you should ask them. Let them know you're concerned, and offer to help them.Don't get angry or blame the person for his drug use. Remember, addiction is a disease, not a conscious choice. If the person is suffering from addiction, he needs treatment.
It takes a lot of courage to admit when you have a problem. Acknowledge that this is difficult.
Don't preach to the person or talk to them when you're feeling hurt about the problems their drug use may be causing. Try to remember to be calm, concerned, and helpful.

, There are a number of different treatment options. It might take some time to find the right treatment for a drug problem, but if the person is willing to be persistent, they can return to a drug-free life.Being an addict is the same as managing any chronic health condition. Expect the steps that the person is taking to continue throughout their lifetime.
Remind the person that treatment is private, and no one needs to know about it. Anything discussed with a medical provider, including treatment for prescription drug addiction, is bound by the HIPAA privacy act in the United States.

, In addition to the familiar 12-step groups, there are a variety of intensive behavioral treatments available. Treatment for dependence of prescription drugs can be delivered in a wide range of settings. Encourage the person to access the treatment that they feel most comfortable with.Outpatient treatment includes individual and group counseling options. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and multidimensional family therapy are two approaches. There are also approaches that focus on incentives and rewards, such as motivational interviewing and motivational incentives.
Intensive outpatient programs (IOPs) may be suggested. These programs meet at least three days per week for two to four hours per day, and can be scheduled around other personal responsibilities.Residential treatment may be recommended, especially for more severe addiction. Some residential treatment is more intensive, and involves living in a treatment facility while undergoing behavioral treatment during the day. Most stays are 28-60 days, sometimes longer.
Other residential treatment options include therapeutic communities, which extend over a 6-12 month stay.
Each person's recovery is unique. There is no one method of behavioral treatment that is right for everyone.

, Pharmacological treatment will vary depending on the type of drugs the person has been abusing. To access these treatment options will require a visit to a medical provider or doctor. These options are best paired with behavioral treatment.For opioid addiction, the person may be prescribed naltrexone, methadone, or buprenorphine. These drugs may help diminish the body's craving for opioids.
For addiction to other prescription medications, such as stimulants (such as Adderall or Concerta) or depressants (such as barbiturates or benzodiazepine), there is currently no FDA-approved pharmacological treatment. Withdrawal from these substances can be medically challenging, and professional medical support is encouraged to minimize physical damage.

Ask for help and support from your sober friends.,
Don’t feel the need to share everything.,
Talk about a plan.,
Be specific about what friends can do.,
Expect emotion.,
Try to anticipate questions.",How to Tell Your Friends About Your Drug Addiction2," Once you’ve told your friends about your drug addiction, you’ll presumably want to ask for their support in your recovery. Help might come in a variety of ways, from encouraging you and watching out for your wellbeing to helping you get to support meetings and other things. Friends may also be able to help you find some sort of treatment, if you’ve not yet started.Make sure that the friends you ask to support you are sober. Friends who use drugs will not be able to help you.
You might say something along the lines of “I really need help to get better. Can I count on your support during this time?” You might also ask for specific help, i.e. “Can you help me find a treatment center?” or “Can you help watch my daughter while I try to get clean?”

, Just because you’re telling friends about your addiction doesn’t mean that you have to share everything. In fact, you might spend some time thinking about what aspects of your addiction you’re comfortable sharing with each friend and what ones you’re not. Planning this conversation can make you seem less defensive or cagey.Be firm and unapologetic if you don’t want to share. It’s perfectly OK to respond to a question by saying, “I’d rather not talk about that just now.”

, Telling your friends about your drug addiction is part of taking control and showing your desire to recover. You will have to demonstrate that you want to get clean and start treatment, so be ready to tell them about your plan and how they can help you.If you’re talking to loved one, chances are that you’ve already accepted your addiction and thought about the future. Tell your friends how you envision getting help, be it a stint in rehab and detox, attending sobriety support groups, or a mix of approaches.
A plan will help you to keep the discussion on track and avoid getting derailed by the emotions that this sort of talk can elicit, from you and your friends. Think of it as a “blueprint.” It will communicate to your friends that you’re serious, even if you don’t have all the details sorted out just yet., Your friends and loved ones might not really know how to offer support or help. Say so if you haven’t already, and be specific about what you need. This can help you start to build a strong social support network.Say clearly if you want help friends to help you find a rehab program, give moral and emotional support, or perhaps help to take care of your children while you focus on recovery.
You might say something like “I’m afraid of making that first appointment, because it seems like admitting I’m a failure. Can you help me do it?” or “It’s been a struggle and I just might need a hug some days.”

, Expect your friends to have lots of questions and also to show a range of emotions, from surprise and confusion to anger, resentment, and hurt. Try to be patient and mindful. Above all else, remember that your friends care and ultimately want what’s best for you – i.e. your recovery.Resist the urge to get defensive if your friends become angry. Try to diffuse anger by saying that you’re not asking them to support you in your addiction, only to support you in recovery.
Keep in mind that friends who also use drugs may try to talk you out of getting help. You will have to stay firm in your decision if this happens. You may also need to tell any friends who use that you will not be able to spend time around them if they are high.

, Think before you disclose your addiction about what kind of questions your friends are most likely to ask you. This will help you answer as best as possible. For instance, your friends might ask how long you’ve been addicted, how it started, or why you waited so long to get treatment.Expect to talk about what drives your addiction, as well, such as the people, places, behavior, and attitudes that contribute to it. This is important information for your friends, as it can keep them from enabling the addiction.

"

Think about how drugs affect your life.,
Learn more about addiction.,
Write a letter.",How to Tell Your Friends About Your Drug Addiction3," Getting better will mean some self-reflection and exploration. Before you talk with your friends, it will help to take some time to ask how drugs impact your life and your relationships with others. Ask how addiction has taken over your life. Doing so will lead to better self-understanding. Consider writing out all of your addiction’s negative effects on your life and personal relationships. What do drugs cost you? What might they cost you in the long run in terms of your dreams, your aspirations, your job, and your friendships?
How and in what areas do drugs affect your life? Have they alienated you from loved ones? Have they undermined your physical wellbeing? Have they hurt your emotional or spiritual health?

, Try to learn as much as you can about drugs and drug addiction as a form of mental illness. There are plenty of resources to utilize. For instance, you can try reading about addiction online at sites like the Mayo Clinic or Cleveland Clinic. You can also try talking to addiction specialists – mental health professionals who are trained to handle addiction. Your general practitioner is one place to start. Inform her of the problem, if you haven’t already. She can then refer you to an addiction specialist or to a more specific rehab program.
Try searching on your own for doctors who specialize in treating addiction, alternatively. Consult organizations like the American Society of Addiction and the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry to look for options and referral advice.

, Talking about addiction, again, is not easy. If you’re finding it hard to express yourself or talk in person with friends, consider writing to them. A letter can act as a tool for an in-person discussion or can in some cases stand-in, especially if the recipient is involved in your addictive behavior and not someone you want to have direct contact with. It will also let you plan your words and to write out what you want to say.


You might write the letter beforehand and then read it to friends in their presence. Or, you can ask them to read it on their own.
The letter can be long or short and can include everything you would want to say in a normal conversation, like the problem itself, an apology, and a request for your friends’ support.
Writing a letter might also be the best way to end an unhealthy relationship with a friend who fuels your addictive behavior, and to explain why you can no longer continue to associate with that person.

Visit a psychiatrist for pharmacological help.,
See a therapist.,
Join a support group.,
Check into inpatient rehab.",How to Stop Smoking Pot/Weed2," A medical doctor (MD) or doctor of osteopathy (DO) can prescribe medications designed to help you ease off of marijuana. If you've tried to quit cold turkey or to quit gradually, or even if you just know that there's no way you can do it on your own, seeing a doctor may be your best bet.


Make sure you're committed to quitting before you make an appointment. Not only is visiting a doctor expensive, but many will not take you as a patient again if you continually relapse.

, If there are underlying issues that are driving your marijuana use — such as depression or anxiety — talking them through with a professional could help you quit. If possible, try to find someone who specializes in addiction issues.


Look at different modalities. There are several modalities, or types of therapy, that might be appropriate for pot addiction. Talk therapy is the most common kind, but you might also investigate cognitive-behavioral therapy.

, If you're having a hard time quitting on your own because of peer pressure or a lack of confidence, a support group might be the answer for you.


Narcotics Anonymous is in several countries, and provides free membership and meetings. Search online for groups in your area.

, If nothing else has worked and your marijuana addiction is seriously endangering your health and happiness, you might need the extreme help that inpatient rehab offers.


Exhaust all your other options first. Rehab is difficult and expensive, and not something you should enter lightly. If you are truly out of choices, though, it might be the best thing.

Set a date for when you want to be completely pot-free.,
Establish a tapering plan.,
Portion out your pot ahead of time.,
Stay busy.,
Stay motivated.",How to Stop Smoking Pot/Weed3," Scheduling it somewhere between two weeks and a month out should make it close enough that you don't lose sight of it, but not so close that tapering off feels impossible. If you think this is really unrealistic, you can give yourself a few months to really quit. If pot has really become a major fixture in your life, it will be hard to just give it up after a few weeks.

, Plot out how much you'll use between now and your quit date. Try to make it a linear process — for example, at the halfway point between today and the quit date, you should be using half as much as you are now.


Put your plan on a calendar, marking how much you'll use for every day, and stick to it. Put the calendar in a place where you have to look at it every day, like next to the bathroom mirror or on the refrigerator.

, Instead of relying on yourself in the moment to only take what's in your tapering plan, set up your portions ahead of time. That way you don't have to think about it — you just take what you've promised yourself you will. Just like taking your medication.

, As your pot use tapers down and you're spending less time using, find activities to do immediately after you smoke. Transition straight from that to doing another hobby or sport you enjoy, so that you don't have time to notice the difference. Though you should still make time to be alone and relax, try to keep your day filled with hobbies, social activities, schoolwork, or anything else that can keep you focused on something other than smoking pot.


Take a look at your schedule and try to fill it with as many social engagements and activities as you can without feeling overwhelmed.

, If you really want to quit, then you have to keep your eyes on the prize. Remind yourself why you want to quit, whether it's to improve your health, your thinking, your social life, or your overall perspective on life, and stay focused on that goal like a laser. Write it down and tape it above your desk, keep an index card with your motives in your pocket, or just keep your goals in an accessible place that you can easily reach whenever you're losing steam.


Whenever you're having a moment of weakness, consider all of the things you can do once you stop smoking for good. You'll feel more active, more energetic, and more motivated to do all of the things you want to do.

Your physician will be able to help you gradually reduce tramadol use in order to minimize withdrawal symptoms.Always seek medical attention as often as you feel it's necessary.;
, The following is a list of symptoms that you will likely experience during your detox process, however you ultimately choose to detox.Should you experience any symptoms outside of the list, it is definitely advisable to contact your physician, or check in to a hospital or emergency room right away.


Diarrhea
Headache
Nausea and vomiting
Respiratory issues
Shivering
Sweating
Tremors
Hair standing on end

, Stopping using Tramadol is somewhat different from detoxing from other opiates because of its anti-depressant effects.This means that the following psychological and mood-related symptoms also regularly occur when detoxing from tramadol:Insomnia
Anxiety
Intense cravings for tramadol
Panic attacks
Hallucinations

, Tramadol withdrawal symptoms will typically peak 48-72 hours after the last dose. These symptoms can last anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.The severity of withdrawal symptoms will also depend on the level of tramadol use and dependence.

, Suboxone is a drug used for opiate detox, and it must be obtained by a physician who is certified to use it. It is used to prevent most withdrawal symptoms and prevent cravings.


Other drugs that ease withdrawal symptoms include clonidine, which reduces agitation, anxiety, and nausea, and buprenorphine, which shortens the timeframe of the detox.If you want to taper your use, unassisted by other drugs designed for detoxification, it still may be in your best interest to look into prescription antidepressants. Because Tramadol has antidepressant properties, you may experience mild to moderate depression upon detoxing., Stopping taking Tramadol “cold turkey” can produce particularly strong, potentially dangerous withdrawal symptoms, including seizures.Put yourself on a tapering schedule that you stick to, no matter what. Mark dates that you should decrease use on a calendar or planner. Gradually reducing your consumption of the drug before stopping altogether can help your body self-regulate and will reduce the pain and danger of withdrawal. The method of tapering will be dependent on the presence of other physical and mental conditions present.


In general, tapering opioids consists of a reduction by 10% daily, 20% every three to five days, and 25% a week. It is never advisable to taper by 50% daily anytime during the tapering process.For example, if you’re taking three pills per day, start your taper by taking two pills, one in the morning and one in the evening. In a week’s time, drop to only one pill in the morning, and stay there for another week. Stop taking it entirely once you have been taking a half pill a day for a week.

, Set up a self-care routine that will also work to ease withdrawal symptoms. Put yourself on a bland, but nutritious diet to ease gastro-intestinal discomfort while still providing nutrients for your body’s adjustment. Lots of water is also crucial because of its role in the healing process and since fluids deplete rapidly during detox. Because of the flu-like symptoms you might experience, use heating pads and cold packs to help regulate your temperature and be more comfortable. Hot showers will also ease bone and muscle pain which is also common.It is also safe to use over the counter pain medications to treat other withdrawal symptoms.
Taking a walk or any light exercise each day will help to increase your serotonin levels, which will help combat the depression that can accompany detox.

, There are natural supplements that you can also use to target parts of your mental and physical health that will be affected by withdrawal symptoms. While tapering, try L-Tyrosine, which helps brain functioning. You can also use Valerian Root, which helps with sleep difficulty brought on by cutting out Tramadol.


Consult your doctor before using supplements of any kind. Even natural supplements can sometimes interact negatively with prescription medications or certain medical conditions.

, While you are detoxing, remember not to use alcohol or other drugs. Because of the danger of mixing the two, even smaller doses of Tramadol combined with alcohol can worsen withdrawal symptoms of depression, and also cause confusion, suicidal ideations, loss of consciousness, brain damage, and respiratory depression., Consider the possibility of getting treatment for addiction to tramadol. You can also consult your doctor about whether or not in or outpatient treatment might be a good way for you to get through stopping taking the pills. Addiction treatments include the organization of treatment programs for patients, usually offering a combination of medical attention and counseling or group therapy to help get off the drug and understand the emotions behind using.


Inpatient treatment involves a long stay at a residential facility, and is used for severe cases of tramadol addiction. Here, you will find a controlled and safe environment for the detoxification process.
Outpatient treatment provides treatment and therapy at a clinic as you continue your normal routine at home. This type of treatment is used for less severe cases of use for patients who want to be able to continue the activities and relationships of daily life while detoxing.
If you decide to go to a detox center or rehab facility, use this link to find a program close to you.

, Counselors, doctors, and psychiatrists are all at your disposal and are trained to help you resist the temptation of drug addiction. Behavior treatments can help to find ways to deal with cravings in drug use, and experts can suggest strategies to avoid relapse and deal with it if it occurs.

, After tramadol detox, it might be important to begin examining the root causes of your addiction to the drug. Often, drug use becomes a way of coping with life and intense emotions. Through behavioral therapy and counseling, you can look at the causes of and contributors to addiction and start to learn new ways of coping with and healing wounds from life’s difficulties., Support groups, like those that follow the 12-step format, are great opportunities to maintain your sobriety with others who understand the difficulties of doing so. During meetings you will be able to share your struggles and exchange tips for coping with life during and after detox. These groups are also a major help in preventing relapse by creating a source of accountability for your sobriety.


Groups like Narcotics Anonymous deal specifically with addiction to opiates.

In many cases, attempting to taper off of drugs and alcohol on your own can be dangerous and life-threatening and should not be attempted outside of a detox facility or without the supervision of a doctor.;
, Your PCP may be able to give you an assessment or direct you to someone else who can. Assessment is your first step toward treatment. It determines if detox is needed and what treatment plan will work best for you. You’ll meet with an addiction professional like a counselor, doctor or nurse who specializes in substance abuse. You’ll answer questions about your current use, health, past addiction treatment and medical history. A physical exam may also be a part of the evaluation.


Contact your health insurance.Tell them you need to find a local provider for a substance abuse evaluation. Ask your insurance about your benefit coverage and costs. Contact the provider and schedule an appointment.
Contact the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services (SAMHSA) administration if you don’t have insurance. SAMHSA provides referrals for addictions and mental health treatment, including substance abuse evaluations. They can also help you find low cost and state-funded options: http://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline.

, Detox is different from treatment. Detox is the first step before you can begin treatment. It’s the process of weaning or tapering from alcohol or drugs so your body can function without these substances. Detox takes days or weeks.


The detox program will vary based on the type of addiction. Alcohol and many drug addictions, like heroin, require medically supervised detox since they cause severe physical withdrawal when stopped.For medically supervised detox, medications are used to control withdrawal symptoms. Your vitals, like your pulse and breathing, are closely monitored. You’ll either stay at a facility or detox at home until you are fully weaned and physically stable.

, The results of your substance abuse evaluation will determine your treatment plan. Whether you tapered from alcohol or drugs on your own or through medically supervised detox, treatment is crucial to remaining clean. The frequency and intensity of treatment, also known as the level of care, varies based on your personal situation and needs. Treatment involves a combination of individual and group counseling, and possibly medical monitoring. Inpatient treatment is living 24/7 at an addictions recovery facility. This is the most intensive treatment. You’ll participate in individual and group counseling programs. Your activities are structured. A team of addictions and medical professionals manage your care.
Intensive outpatient is spending more than 9 hours per week in treatment. You typically go to an addictions treatment facility. You live at home and often can maintain responsibilities like work while attending treatment. There are programs tailored to adults who work. They take place during evening and weekend hours.
Outpatient treatment is attending individual and group addictions counseling a few hours each week. You might attend treatment at an addictions facility or at a counselor’s office. This is the least intensive treatment.

, As you improve and maintain sobriety, you’ll move from a more intensive to a less intensive level of care. For example, you might start as inpatient, go to intensive outpatient and finally move to outpatient treatment. Most people who are successful at kicking alcohol and drug addiction for good stay in treatment for years.


Staying in treatment helps prevent relapse. If you do relapse, you'll be able to get back on track more quickly because you're already connected to treatment professionals.

, Before you quit using, meet with your Primary Care Doctor (PCP) to see if you can stop using without medical help. Your body is used to functioning with the alcohol or drugs and stopping on your own can cause severe complications.Ask your doctor how long it will take for you to get the alcohol or drugs out of your system. Typically it takes several days.

, If your doctor says it’s OK to taper on your own, ask a friend to help you during this process. Your friend can watch out for you and help you get to the doctor if tapering on your own doesn’t go well. Make sure this person is someone you trust and supportive of your decision to stop using.

, Stopping cold turkey or all at once can bring on severe withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal may be less severe if you taper down slowly each day. Talk to your doctor about which plan is safe for you.


Withdrawal is more than just a bad hangover. Symptoms include vomiting, diarrhea, shaking, headaches, heart palpitations, insomnia, paranoia, and delusions. Withdrawal can be life-threatening.
An example of a slow taper from alcohol is decreasing one beer a day (from twelve to eleven, then eleven to ten).
An example of a slow taper for hydrocodone is going from the usual 80 mg a day down to 70 mg the next week, and so on.Cold turkey is going from your usual amount of alcohol or drug to 0. If you’re stopping cold turkey, rid your house of all alcohol or drugs.

, Clear your schedule so you can just focus on tapering. You may not feel well enough to go to work or handle any responsibilities the first few days of your taper.

, Drink a lot of water during your taper to help rid your body of toxins and reduce headaches. Ginger ale and sparkling water are easier on the digestive system. They are good alternatives to water if you’re feeling nauseous. Drink often throughout your taper.Pain relievers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, and ice packs applied to your head can also help with headaches.

, You’ll probably feel nauseous during your taper. Simple carbohydrates like crackers, rice and toast are gentle on your stomach. Applesauce and bananas will also keep you nourished and help to calm your stomach. Drinking ginger tea and taking antacids also help with nausea.

, You might be up for going for a walk, or maybe taking a bath or hot shower makes you feel better. Even if it’s watching TV or old movies, take care of yourself during your taper.

, Tapering on your own is hard. Be kind to yourself if it doesn’t go well or you go back to using — sometimes this happens, and it means you need a different plan. Talk to your doctor about medically supervised tapering, also known as detox.

, Keep away from places and situations where you used to drink and use drugs. Change your routines. For instance, if you pass your favorite bar on the way home from the grocery store, find a new grocery store and use a different route home.


If hanging out with a certain group of friends tempts you to drink or use drugs, it's better to avoid them altogether. Wait until you're stronger before you put yourself in tempting situations. Find supportive people to hang out with.

, Maintaining sobriety is a lifelong effort. During and after treatment, connect with people who are recovering from addiction. Peer support groups are made up of people dealing with addition and recovery. There are no professionals. Attending peer support helps you break old, unhealthy habits and stick to a new, healthy routine.


Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) groups are available across the country. You regularly attend meetings and follow a 12 Step Program to support your recovery. The 12 steps follow spiritual principals.SMART Recovery is another type of peer support group. It features a 4-Point Program that helps people change harmful behaviors, thoughts and actions. Online and in-person groups are available across the country., Close family members are the most impacted by your addiction. You are both recovering together. It will take time for your bond to strengthen. As they see your continued commitment to recovery, your relationships will improve. Support each other during your treatment and recovery process.


Attend family counseling. Meeting with a professional helps you work through the pain caused by addiction. You can learn coping strategies and how to better support each other.
Family members can join Al-Anon or Alateen. They are support groups for people who care about someone with an addiction. Al-Anon is for adults who have a loved one with an addiction. Alateen is for teens who have a parent or caregiver with an addiction. Groups are available across the country., Some people may take a leave from work while they are in treatment. Others continue with their responsibilities, with some adjustments. Your approach with work will vary based on your personal situation and treatment plan. Most employers will try to work with you to support your recovery.


Talk to human resources about your company’s time off and leave policies. For medical leave, you’ll need documentation of your condition from a medical provider.
Consider adjusting your schedule. Find out from human resources or your manager if you can work reduced hours or a flexible schedule.
Be careful about who you talk to about your addiction and treatment. Not everyone is supportive of someone going through addiction treatment. Avoid judgments and gossip by only telling people who you trust and who will be supportive.

, Your eating habits probably weren’t the healthiest during your addiction. You’ll see improvements in how you feel when you take better care of yourself. Slowly increase your intake of fruits, vegetables and lean protein like chicken and fish. Drink plenty of water.


Consider working with a nutritionist. Some addictions cause injury to the digestive system. You may need a special diet that is gentle on your digestive tract and that helps you absorb nutrients. The nutritionist will help you develop a healthier eating plan based on your specific needs., Regular exercise is not only good for your heart and muscles. It reduces stress and improves your mood. Start slowly. Even 10 minutes a day of walking will make a big difference to your health. Over time, you’ll be able to do more.Work out with a friend. You're less likely to blow off exercise if you have a friend holding you accountable. Plus, it's more fun to walk, bike or go to the gym with a friend. You're more likely to stick with your new healthy habit.

, Create a soothing bedtime routine like taking a bath and reading a book. Minimize the use of electronics like cell phones, tablets, computers and TV before bed. A few minutes of gentle stretches or yoga can also help you fall asleep. Aim for 6 to 8 hours of sleep each night and try to go to asleep around the same time every night.Get help from your Primary Care Doctor (PCP) if your sleep doesn’t improve. Your doctor can help you develop a plan for getting quality sleep. You could have an underlying medical concern that makes it hard to sleep. You may need prescription sleep medications.

, Your addiction was the center of your life. Removing the addiction and staying sober means you have to refocus your attention. This is a time for reinvention and discovering new passions. Having a passion helps make life meaningful.Start a hobby. Think about what activities you enjoyed when you were younger. Activities that brought you joy in your youth usually make good hobbies when you’re an adult. Try painting, music, sports, photography, cooking, sewing or dancing. Find classes at your local community college.

, Education is not just for kids. Learning new talents and career skills is a lifelong journey. You never stop growing. Think about your work. Are you in the right field or role? Is there a different field you want to pursue? What steps you need to take to have a fulfilling career? Dedicate yourself to the education and training needed to reach your goal.


Contact your local career or job center, also known as One Stop Career Centers, to connect with career counselors and free education resources., Help others in recovery and raise public awareness about addictions. Organizations like the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (NCADD) have local volunteer opportunities. Volunteering doesn’t only help others. Giving back makes you feel stronger and increases your self-confidence. "

Chances are, your addiction likely affects your family, especially if you live in the same home. If your relationships with your family have suffered as a result of your drug addiction, saying that you are seeking recovery and treatment can be a part of the mending process.Even if you try to hide your addiction, it’s likely your family has suspicions, as drug addictions can affect several aspects of functioning.It’s best to get them on your side with support instead of engaging in shame and secrecy.
It's also important to asses the risks of telling certain family members and determine whether it is necessary. Some may have trouble understanding, coping, or reacting to the information in a healthy way. This may include family members with learning disabilities, emotional struggles and mental health issues; children or the elderly; family members already dealing with a drug addiction; family members who are abusive or likely to react in a harmful way; etc.;
, By planning what to say, you can get better support and have a more productive conversation. Plan to talk about the “process” first, meaning, prime your family for discussion and what you’re hoping to get from the discussion. Then, talk about the specific problems of your drug addiction, followed by ways you’d like your family to help.Having a format in mind can help keep the conversation on track and minimize distractions or tangents.

, It’s entirely up to you how much you want to disclose to your family about your addiction. You are not required to tell them things that make you feel uncomfortable or that bring you shame. Keep in mind why you want to tell them about your addiction, and let this guide what you say.You may want to use this discussion as a way to ask for help in seeking treatment. If so, keep your discussion centered around how treatment will help you and why their support is important.
If your goal is to tell your family as a way to gain support for your recovery, there’s no need to tell them about events that cause you shame; however, if there is a risk of pregnancy or serious health risks due to drug use, this may be information you want to share.

, Prior to going into the discussion, know that you may be met with many types of reactions from your family. They may be shocked, bewildered, sad, embarrassed, or even angry. Some may be immediately supportive and helpful. Keep in mind that initial reactions are likely in response to the drugs and what they are doing to your life and are not necessarily directed at you personally.It may take some time for the “shock factor” to blow over; it may take minutes, hours, or weeks. Be ready to face their reactions, both positive and negative.


Allow your family time to process the news. Once the shock wears off, they may be more willing to help and support you.
Your family may want to share with you the ways in which your addiction has affected them. This may be difficult to hear, and you may want to suggest you all attend family counseling to work through any feelings of resentment or anger.

, You may wish to enlist the help of a close friend in telling your family about your addiction. This way, you can have the support of someone who cares about you while you talk to your family. This person can help you if you’re struggling to open up or talk about what is bothering you. He can assist you in telling people you care about of your addiction., Start the discussion by talking about what you’re hoping to get from having this discussion and why it’s important to you to talk to your family. Prepare your family for the discussion by introducing it well.Often, starting the conversation is the hardest part, so you may want to practice this ahead of time.


For example, you can say, “I have something serious I need to talk about, and I’m really nervous about bringing it up. I’m hoping you will listen and try to understand as I try to tell you about this difficult thing in my life.”
You can also say, “I’m really struggling with something, and this is my way of reaching out to you. It’s really hard for me to talk about this, so please take me seriously and listen. I’m hoping you will be supportive.”

, Be honest with your family during this discussion and tell them if you are currently using. Don’t lie or downplay your use, which might be tempting.Instead, be honest and tell your family what’s going on.


Say, “I’m currently using, but it’s because I’m scared to stop. I want to get this under control.”

, Tell your family how addiction is affecting you. You may feel mixed emotions, which is okay.On the one hand, you may notice how addiction is negatively affecting your life, yet you find it hard to stop and cannot think of finding an alternative. By talking about your emotions, you can help your family recognize how the addiction is affecting your life and that you are suffering.


Say, “I never thought I would get to this point, and it scares me knowing I can’t help myself. I need help.”

, Tell your family why you are concerned. Clue them in on what is bothering you and how it is affecting your life. Drugs can affect social, emotional, physical, and spiritual aspects of your life.Feel free to give examples of situations that you feel comfortable talking about with your family.For example, you can say, “Since I’ve started using drugs, I’m having a really hard time going to work, and I’m scared I might get fired.”
You can also say, “The drugs are impairing my ability to raise my child, and I’m scared I’m turning into a bad parent. I don’t want to hurt my child and I want to be a good parent.”

, If it’s difficult for you to gather your family or you feel more comfortable writing instead of talking with your family, consider writing a letter or sending an email. This way, you can organize your thoughts and say what you need to say without interruption.


A letter also allows your family members to process the information on their own time and get in touch with you when they are ready.

, Perhaps your family will refuse to help you and support you. Remind them that you are asking for support for your recovery. You are not asking for them to help you support your addiction. Say that you are reaching out to your family because you are hoping to gain the love and support that family can offer.Say, “My intention is to recover from my addiction. I do not want help supporting my addiction or involving my family in it. I want to be free from this.”

, Some family members may be inclined to give you advice, tell you what to do, or run your life for you. Be clear in stating that you are reaching out to ask for encouragement.Having someone to talk to can help you reduce your stress and elevate your mood. When talking to your family, make it clear that you are seeking help and support, not judgment and discouragement.


Say, “This is a very difficult process for me, and it would be very helpful to have my family encourage me and support me to get better.”

, You may feel overwhelmed by the prospect of looking for treatment on your own. Ask your family to help you find a place for you to safely recover. Treatment centers are located all around the United State.Find a center that is accredited by the state and has trained and licensed medical and psychological professionals.


Say, “I want to get treatment, but I am feeling very overwhelmed. Will you help me find something?”
Sit down with your family and look online to find an appropriate treatment center. You can also call your insurance to see which treatment centers are covered.

, If you need specific help with something, state this clearly. For instance, if you want someone to attend meetings with you or drive you to therapy appointments, state this clearly. Say what you need help with and ask who is willing to help you succeed in your treatment.Any requests you make should be centered around treatment and getting help with recovery.
Say, “I want to go to weekly therapy, yet I cannot drive myself. Would you be willing to give me a ride in order to support my recovery?”

, If your family tries to overload you with advice or tell you what to do, set boundaries. Be clear when you want advice from others and when you want someone to just listen. If someone tries to discredit you or your treatment, remind her gently that you are the one with the addiction, and you are seeking help in the best way you know how.If family members offer you their opinions or uninformed advice, be firm in stating what is helpful and what is not. Say, “I appreciate your concern; however, I feel really overwhelmed. I think it’s best to take the advice of the treatment professionals.”

However you find out about your teen's steroid abuse, be it through spotting symptoms or hearing about it from someone else, you need to confront them. Although your child may not want to speak about your concerns, you must be persistent regarding their health., Open up a discussion but do not get angry with them. Be there for them, allowing them to feel that they are safe and can express themselves fully. Ask your child about why they are abusing steroids and where they have been gaining access to them. You should try to obtain this information to help your child, not to punish them. Some things you may want to discuss include:


Your teen’s stress level. Talk to your child about their stress levels and even their self-esteem. Are they feeling pressured by others? Get to the root of the problem. Once you find out the reasoning, you have already achieved the first vital step.

, It is common for teens to deny their steroid abuse. If this is the case and your teen absolutely refuses to talk to you, you can purchase a home drug testing kit. Once the results are positive, there is no more room for discussion on the matter. At this point you will know for a fact, and will need to take the necessary steps to help them succeed in their recovery.

, You need to make a plan based on your child’s specific case. What does your teen need? How will you provide it? You need to make a plan of action. This will not only address what will be done but how you'll pay for it.


The cost may be covered through public or private insurance plans.

, Once you have this discussion with your child, you need to seek some medical attention. It's important to see if your teen has experienced any damage to their health. Some side-effects are reversible, so it's important to see what damage has been caused. Set up an appointment for a physical with your family doctor.Medications that target symptoms of withdrawal and antidepressants are commonly prescribed to kids who have been abusing steroids. Talk to your doctor about medications and whether or not they are a good choice for your child.

, There are many different types of therapy available to help kids with abuse problems. These can be individual meetings with a therapist, or you can schedule family therapy sessions. There are also in-home counselors available through substance abuse programs. Some of the issues that may be discussed in the therapy sessions include:


Your child’s feelings regarding their athletic performance.
Feeling of perfectionism and your child’s self-esteem.
Major life transitions and their ability to cope.
Anxiety related to personal relationships and situations.

, Group therapy is also an option as it allows others to share their experiences. When your child discusses the situation they are experiencing with others, they may gain valuable insights.


Talk to your doctor about group therapy sessions in your area. You can also run an online search.

Watch for sweating or damp skin when they haven't been in the heat or doing physical activity.

, Many club drugs dilate the user's pupils to an unusually large size, including methamphetamine, LSD, and GHB.Constricted ""pinpoint"" pupils, even in dimly lit rooms, are often an effect of heroin or other opioids, but these drugs are less common in party scenes., Different club drugs affect people in different ways. On ecstasy (the most common club drug) or other stimulants a person may have extremely high energy levels. On sedatives, such as rohypnol, the person may have no energy or lose consciousness completely.Many drugs can cause aggressive or combative behavior, or hallucinations that cause the user to react with fear or euphoria to nonexistent stimuli.All the drugs affect the brain but in different ways.

Put your list in a place where you’ll see it every day, like in your kitchen, in your office, or on the bathroom mirror.;
, It will be really hard (or maybe impossible) for you to get clean if you are tempted to use. Limit your exposure to triggers – these are people, places, situations, smells, tastes, feelings, and memories that all give you the urge to take club drugs. People who are dealing with addiction need to know what their triggers are and steer clear of them.One obvious trigger for club drug use is raves. You’ll almost certainly need to stop attending raves and other clubs where there are freely available drugs. It’s best to stop going entirely, even if the rave is supposed to be drug-free.
What are your other triggers? Do you want to use when you’re feeling down or stressed? Do you use when you’re around a certain group of friends? You will have to find ways to avoid these situations and people.

, Some club drugs like Ecstasy are physically addictive. This means that you’ll have symptoms of withdrawal and cravings for the drug when you stop using it. You’ll have to find ways to cope with these cravings, perhaps even after your body moves past the withdrawal stage.Consider taking up new hobbies and establishing new habits to focus your mind elsewhere. Take up painting or art, for example, join a recreational sport league, or enroll in exercise classes.
When you have cravings, try to distract yourself until they pass. Pick up a book and read, make a phone call, go for a walk, or hum a tune.
Alternatively, try holding an ice cube in your hand for five minutes or dunking your head into some cold water. This strategy is used in something called dialectical behavior therapy, which can prompt your central nervous system to reset itself., A major trigger for drug use can be the people that you know. Friendships with the wrong people can fuel addictions, especially if you are associating with other addicts or people who encourage or enable you to use. You may have to cut such people out of your life.You will probably have mixed feelings about cutting friends out of your life. But think of it this way. True friends care about your wellbeing. Someone who encourages you to use drugs is either not concerned about your welfare or is too addicted to help you.

, Club drugs like Ecstasy, Methamphetamine, GHB, and Rohypnol affect the body in different ways. Users will have different symptoms and issues than, say, people who are getting treatment for alcohol or opioid dependency. You’ll need to find a program that can cater to your specific needs.Look for centers that can treat club drug addictions. You might start with the US government’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services (SAMHSA). They host a search function for health services centers. Just go to their website and enter your ZIP code into the service locator. Also try calling SAMHSA’s Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).Alternatively, make an appointment with your doctor and ask for recommendations for substance abuse treatment.

, Rehab for club drugs is not always straight-forward. This is partially because users don’t always know what kinds of drugs they have been taking. They may go from rave to rave and have no idea what they’re using or may be ingesting drugs that are added to foods or drinks. Once you choose a program, you’ll need to work with the staff to find the right kind of treatment.Cooperate with the drug-screening. A battery of tests will help doctors figure out just what kinds of drugs you have in your system and how to best treat you.
It’s possible that doctors can control your withdrawal symptoms in rehab. You’ll need to share your symptoms so that they know what meds to prescribe, whether for nausea, sleep problems, or depression.
You should also ask about in-patient or out-patient treatment and what’s best for you. In-patient programs will require you to live at the center for anywhere from 30 to 90 days. Out-patient programs let you live at home, are less structured, and can include weekly therapy sessions and consultations.

, Of course, drug rehabilitation should try to get at the deeper reasons of your use. Meds may help you feel more comfortable, but they don’t get at the root causes of addiction. That said, be open to therapy to help pinpoint and address what makes you use in the first place.Consider Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, for example. In CBT, addiction is treated as the result of “maladaptive thoughts.” You’ll talk to a therapist, who will help you recognize untrue or false thoughts about your use and help you to change them.
Don’t be afraid to seek help for other issues, too. Addicts can often experience depression, for example, and you may need help from a therapist to get through these low feelings., To ensure that you stay sober, keep your eyes on staying well and on your goals for the future. Remember all of the reasons that you have for not returning to your old ways and using club drugs. One way to do this is by setting short-term goals.Make sure that your short-term goals are concrete and realistic. They can help you build up your confidence and reinforce your abstinence. Consider writing them down in a list, as well.
For instance, you might set short-term goals like completing a 30-day in-patient rehab program, to exercise at least four days per week, to spend more time with your family by setting aside Sunday as “family day,” or others.

, Give yourself bigger reasons to stay on track in dreams and aspirations for the future. You can aim big but, like your short-term goals, these should still be realistic and concrete. Write them down in a list, too, if it helps you to keep them at the front of your mind.You might take as a long-term goal something like being sober and drug-free for one year. You can also give yourself a reward for reinforcement, i.e. “If I’m sober for a whole year, I’ll treat myself to a vacation in a place I’ve always wanted to see.”
You can also have goals that have to do with your relationships, treatment, or career, i.e. “My goal is to form a circle of new, sober friends who will support me,” “I want to attend therapy at least twice a week for the next year,” or “My goal is to work hard and get a promotion in the next two years.”

, Goals are great because they provide focus in life. They will give you things to care about and work towards, which are big motivators in staying clean. Try to fill your life with as many people and activities as you can that will keep you centered and remind you of the value of sobriety.Do you have a partner or children? Link them to your sobriety. Remind yourself that you could jeopardize your relationship to them by using club drugs.
What about artistic pursuits, sports, friendships, or causes? Any of these can be a focus for sustained clean living, too.

They may stop going to work, skip classes, or cancel plans with friends. Instead, they go to clubs or parties where they can get more club drugs or take them freely.For example, the person may skip class or not come to work because they were out the night before at a club or party doing drugs.

, A person who is addicted to drugs may give up activities that are not related to the drug use. They may stop doing things they used to do often, drop out of clubs or groups, or cancel social engagements.For example, a person may stop participating in a sports team or neglect going to the gym due to their club drug use.

Look for caffeine pills or powder.,
Know the dangers.",How to Spot Signs of Study Drug Abuse4," When a person uses caffeine regularly, they can become intoxicated from it. It can cause nervousness, rambling thoughts and conversation, and rapid heartbeat. It can even cause stomach problems, headaches, and muscle tremors., An average teen shouldn't have more than about 100 milligrams of caffeine a day, while an adult should generally limit themselves to 200p milligrams per day.A typical cup of coffee can have anywhere from 100 to 200 milligrams of caffeine. If a teen or even a young adult is craving more than that and drinking it regularly, that could be a sign of addiction., Caffeine is a substance the people build up tolerance to. That means that the more someone uses it, the more they need to take to feel an effect.If you notice a person taking more and more caffeine each day, that could indicate a problem with caffeine.

, If a person has caffeine pills or even caffeine powder laying around everywhere, that could indicate a problem with caffeine. Caffeine pills can have as much as 200 milligrams of caffeine per pill. Caffeine powder, in particular, can be problematic, because pure caffeine is very easy to overdose on.Energy drinks can also contain significant amounts of caffeine.

, While caffeine is a fairly mild stimulant compared to prescription drugs, it can still be dangerous. In fact, an overdose can kill you if you take too much at once,though it does take 5 to 10 grams.In addition, it can cause dependence, problems sleeping, and increased problems with conditions such as anxiety.In fact, many people experience withdrawal symptoms after being on caffeine regularly. Withdrawal symptoms can include tiredness, depression, flu-like symptoms, and the inability to focus. It can impair a person to the point that they can't perform day-to-day functions, such as going to work or completing schoolwork.While it would be difficult to take 5 to 10 grams of caffeine in forms like coffee and even caffeine pills, it would be much easier in powder form, as a gram of caffeine is a relatively small amount, physically.

Pay attention to how many painkillers you are taking.,
Notice changes to your relationships.,
Be aware of the situations that you end up in.,
Get a second opinion.",How to Recognize the Signs of Pain Killer Addiction1," Once a tolerance is built, you take more to receive the same high that you once felt. You will also notice that you get less relief from any pain when you take your medication. If you notice yourself avoiding things you used to do in order to get or take pain medicine, this can be a serious sign of addiction.


A good rule of thumb is that you might have a problem if you are exceeding your doctor's dosing recommendations.
If you are taking painkillers without the knowledge and prescription of a doctor, then this might point to an addiction issue.;
, When you are addicted, you may begin fighting with your spouse or significant other, especially when you haven’t had your painkiller fix. You may distance yourself from friends and family members, and start to form new friendships with other people who are addicted to painkillers. You will also notice that your performance in places like school and work will suffer, making it harder to build relationships there., You may start to share needles, frequent dangerous neighborhoods, or drive while under the influence. If you notice yourself having a disregard for life or safety in order to have access to pain killers, you are likely addicted., Talk to a trusted friend or family member about the dose and frequency you are using. Ask them if they feel like you are abusing your painkillers. Be prepared for an honest answer, and do not get offended if they advise you to seek help.


You can also consult a counselor about your painkiller usage. They will be able to tell you if you have a problem.

You may also notice that the person complains that the painkillers are not strong enough or that they need more. Also, mixing medications to achieve a stronger effect can signal an addiction.

, Over time, painkiller abuse may change the person’s appearance. Significant weight changes, dilated or constricted pupils, and frequent bruising may be indicative of a drug addiction. Glazed and bloodshot eyes are also telltale signs of drug abuse., Getting arrested for buying or selling painkillers is a huge red flag. Pawning items for money frequently might be indicative of drug abuse. Also, stealing and selling or pawning other’s items is a common behavior to pay for painkillers., They will likely begin distancing themselves from friends and family. You might notice that they start to hang out with a new group of friends.

Start counseling.,
Join a support group.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Share these strategies with a loved one.",How to Recognize the Signs of Pain Killer Addiction4," Painkillers not only mask physical pain, but they can numb emotional pain as well. This makes coming off of the painkillers an extremely emotional process for some people. You should be prepared to cope with these emotions, and a counselor can help teach coping mechanisms as well as listen to your needs.

, A support group is generally made up of a mediator that leads the conversation, and members that are going through similar struggles. By realizing that you are not alone in your struggle, you can overcome the isolation that seems to exist for someone struggling with addiction. Support groups can also be a place to hear inspiring success stories.

, Your doctor can help you adjust the dose of your painkillers to slowly bring you off of the drugs. They can also prescribe other, less addictive drugs that can help you move past the need for painkillers. Also, ask your doctor for recommendations to counselors that specialize in drug addiction.

, If you have a friend or family member that you think is addicted to painkillers, you may feel that there is little you can do to help. While it is true that you cannot make the person seek help, you can give them the tools they need to overcome their addiction when they are ready. Point out to them that they can confide in their doctor, counselor, or a support group.

Prepare for withdrawal symptoms.",How to Prevent Young Adult Adderall Abuse," Young adult Adderall abusers use a variety of methods to acquire non-prescribed or excessive quantities of the medication. Sometimes they feign symptoms and seek out a doctor willing to prescribe Adderall, or go “doctor shopping” and get multiple prescriptions from multiple physicians. Most often, however, they simply buy, are given, or take pills from family, friends, or acquaintances.Whether it is Adderall or any other prescription medication, never share your pills with another person. The prescription is intended specifically for you, and may do physical harm or facilitate addiction by the person you think you are helping.Especially if you have a prescription medication that is addictive or susceptible to abuse, keep it in a secure (ideally locked) location, and keep track of the number of pills in your bottle.
Adderall should be treated with the same seriousness as prescription painkillers and should only be used by the person for whom it was prescribed.;
, Some twenty percent of college students admit to abusing a prescription stimulant (usually Adderall) at least once. They typically perceive this type of abuse as less risky and of less concern than abusing prescription pain medications, alcohol, or tobacco products.


However, Adderall abuse is indeed a risky game to play. It carries the risk not only of addiction, but of mental health issues and even stroke or cardiac arrest, among other dangerous side effects.Ideally, you should start talking about the dangers of prescription drug abuse while the person is still a child or teen. Emphasize that prescription medications are only safe when used as directed by the person for whom they are intended, who has been examined and determined to need the medication by a physician. Point out that Adderall is a controlled substance for important reasons, and should not be treated (or used) lightly, as it can have life-threatening consequences., Most young adults who abuse Adderall do so because they think they need the “tunnel-like focus” it provides in order to complete their schoolwork, deal with their other responsibilities, and find time for a social life. And, even if they have experienced negative side effects, some two-thirds of abusers believe Adderall has helped improve their grades or work performance.Some people can legitimately benefit from taking Adderall in order to function successfully, but typical healthy young adults can function perfectly well without it. Usually, a mix of better time management and stress management skills will be far more effective (and much safer) than Adderall abuse.
For college students in particular, improving time management skills can often go a long way toward removing the temptation to try Adderall. Consult wikiHow articles on taking notes and studying as good starting points for ideas on improving time management.
Poor time management can cause stress, and stress can in turn interfere with your ability to get things done. Consult How to Relieve Stress for a variety of resources on how to identify and address stress.

, It can be a particularly frustrating situation as a parent or other concerned party when dealing with a young adult Adderall abuser. If the individual is loading up on prescriptions from multiple doctors, for example, privacy laws and the fact that he or she is an adult will severely limit your ability to stop the flow of pills.Don’t quit trying to help, however. The abuser needs your help, even if he or she vigorously denies it. Look into therapists, recovery groups, treatment centers, and any other options at your disposal. Consider “tough love” like withholding tuition money or lodging if you think that will help, although it may also backfire. Most of all, keep telling the person you care about him or her and want to help., Adderall abuse is a legitimate problem, and it is easy to find heartbreaking examples of its negative consequences. Don’t, however, let this reality make you see Adderall as an evil poison that should be avoided at all costs.When used properly by those who can benefit from it, and under the recommendation and care of an actively-engaged physician, Adderall is an overwhelmingly safe and largely effective treatment for conditions like ADHD.
Young adults who face limiting conditions like ADHD and can legitimately benefit from Adderall should not be prevented or strongly dissuaded from using it. Show your concern for this person by making sure he or she is informed about the medication and its possible side effects, and by emphasizing the importance of proper dosing and usage of it.

, Adderall misuse has been seen more, especially among college-age male population, when a short-acting formula is prescribed. Talk to your doctor about a long acting formula to see if it is the right medication for you or a loved one., Adderall is a brand name for dextroamphetamine-amphetamine, which is prescribed primarily for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. For most people, a dose of Adderall provides 6-8 hours of increased energy and sharper focus. Millions of people take Adderall under a doctor’s care, and although its long-term effects are not well known as of yet, it appears to be a generally successful and well-tolerated medication when taken properly.While Adderall can help bring focus and energy levels up to functional levels in those with certain medical conditions, in healthy individuals it can supercharge these levels for hours at a time.
Adderall has a “high potential for abuse” according to the FDA, and can be highly addictive. About ten percent of illicit users become addicted to the medication., Most young adults who use Adderall without a prescription take it only occasionally or as “needed,” such as to complete a research project due the next morning. Even a single dose, however, can cause noticeable and even dangerous side effects, which is why Adderall is intended to be taken only under a doctor’s care.Early warning signs may include: behavioral changes, heightened attention, memory lapses, heart problems, aggression, hyperactivity, weight loss, dilated pupils, headache, dry mouth, hoarseness, insomnia, nausea, digestive problems, decreased appetite, diarrhea or constipation, anxiety, restlessness, shortness of breath, fatigue, and changes in sex drive.
If a young adult you know seems to get short bursts of boundless energy that just as quickly “crash out” several hours later, keep a close eye out for signs of Adderall abuse.

, When taken over a longer period of time or in excessive amounts, the side effects of Adderall use can become increasingly obvious and severe. Without proper dosing limits and continuing care by a physician, a user can quickly become addicted and go into denial about obvious signs of trouble.Continued abuse of Adderall can result in conditions including: weakness or numbness in the extremities; dizziness; slow or slurred speech; chest pain; hives or rash; blistered skin; vision problems; uncontrolled aggression; paranoia; mania; seizures; stroke; and cardiac arrest.

, Adderall is a controlled substance with a “black box” warning from the FDA primarily due to its propensity for abuse and its possibility of causing strokes and other cardiac events. When taken in excessive amounts, Adderall can quickly cause dangerous and life-threatening situations.Signs of an Adderall overdose can include: panic attacks; hyperventilation; cardiac rhythm abnormalities; hallucinations; severe tremors; severe confusion or delirium; vertigo; unconsciousness; and coma.Contact emergency services immediately if you have reason to suspect an Adderall overdose. You may save a life.

, If you can succeed in breaking an Adderall abuse habit — likely with the assistance of trained professionals — you should prepare to deal with withdrawal symptoms. The body of an abuser quickly becomes accustomed to regular Adderall dosing, and will not respond well to having this supply cut off. Identifying and dealing with withdrawal symptoms is a key element in an ex-abuser of Adderall remaining an ex-abuser.Former abusers going through withdrawal will often exhibit low energy, disrupted sleep patterns, and signs of depression. They may also complain of headaches, nausea, and other physical symptoms of withdrawal. It is vital that people in this delicate stage of recovery receive regular emotional and medical support. Medication may be warranted, and therapy is almost always helpful.

Loosen your bedding.,
Maintain the proper levels of minerals (e.g.,
Stay hydrated.,
Stretch your muscles.,
Check your medications.,
Talk to your doctor about prescription medications.,
See a doctor if you notice any of the following symptoms.",How to Treat Recurring Muscle Cramps1," Tightly tucked sheets and blankets can press down on your toes and put more stress on your calf and foot muscles. This is increased pressure can lead to muscle cramps. Sleeping on your back also increases the likelihood of putting pressure on your toes.Try sleeping on your side with your knees slightly bent to prevent cramps., calcium, magnesium, potassium) in your diet. Consuming too little of these minerals may be contributing to your recurring muscle cramps.However, research has not confirmed that eating a diet rich in these minerals can prevent muscle cramps.


Eat foods that are high in potassium (bananas and oranges) , magnesium (green leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and whole grains), and calcium(dairy, broccoli, kale) in order to obtain these beneficial nutrients.

, Drink plenty of fluids. The amount of fluids you need depends on your age, gender, activity level, climate, and any medications that you are taking. On average, women need about nine cups of fluids per day and men need 13 cups of fluid per day.Listen to your body. If you are thirsty, you need to drink some fluids, preferably water.
If you exercise, you will need to drink an extra 1.5 to 2.5 cups. If exercise lasts more than an hour or you sweat a lot, you will need to drink more than that.Sports drinks with sodium are only needed for long bouts (at least 60 minutes) of intense exercise.You will also need to drink more water if you live in or exercise in very hot and/or humid climates.

, Stretch before and after you use your muscles for an extended period of time. Regular stretching lengthens your muscle fibers and allows them to contract and tighten better.Well conditioned muscles are less likely to cramp.


Focus on the muscles in which you usually get cramps. If you typically get cramps in your calf muscle, stretch your calf muscles daily.

, Statins, long-acting beta agonists, and diuretics can cause muscle cramps. If you are taking one of these medications, talk to your doctor about the cramps you have been experiencing. Do not stop taking your medications without informing your doctor. You do not want to put your health at risk.Statins are used to treat high cholesterol.Examples of statins include atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), pravastatin (Lipostat), rosuvastatin (Crestor), and simvastatin (Zocor).Diuretics are used to remove fluid from your body and are often prescribed to treat high blood pressure.Common diuretics include bumetanide (Bumex) and furosemide (Lasix).Beta-blockers are used to treat high blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythms. Common beta-blockers include atenolol (Tenormin), carvedilol (Coreg), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol), propranolol (Inderal), sotalol (Betapace), and timolol (Timoptic)., There are no medications that are safe, recommended, and proven to treat muscle cramps. Self-care remedies are usually done to treat muscle cramps. However, a few drugs may possibly be effective. These drugs include carisoprodol (Soma), diltiazem, gabapentin, orphenadrine (Norflex), verapamil, and vitamin B12.More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of these medications, but it is worth discussing the option with your doctor.
Avoid taking quinine. Quinine interacts with other medications and can cause serious side effects., Although muscle cramps usually resolve very quickly on their own without any sort of medical treatment, you should consult your doctor to address underlying medical problems. If your cramps are severe, do not go away after stretching, or last a long time, you need to see a doctor.Also see a doctor if your cramps are associated with leg swelling, redness, skin changes, muscle weakness, or are not happening for an obvious reason such as exercising or dehydration."

Quit cold turkey only if you're healthy enough to endure it.,
Set a definitive date and then taper down as much as you can.,
Burn all your dope bridges.,
Find a place to stay.,
Stock up on everything you'll need for 5-7 days.,
Drink lots of water, Gatorade, and grapefruit juice.,
Take Nyquil, Imodium, and dramamine to combat the flu symptoms.,
Eat something.,
Stay clean and try to sleep.,
Get some exercise, if at all possible.,
Take it a day at a time.",How to Quit Using Heroin1," Withdrawing cold turkey means quitting heroin abruptly and getting your withdrawal symptoms over with as quickly as possible, usually 5-7 days of flu-like symptoms and suffering. It can be traumatic psychologically and physically, making it only recommended for users in relatively good health.


Cold turkey heroin withdrawal is, in some cases, fatal, making cold going cold turkey is not recommended for pregnant women, or people with severe health problems.;
, If you want to go cold turkey, it can help to try to get yourself down to as low a dose as possible before you stop altogether it to lessen the shock. Whether you want to say, ""I'm cold turkeying starting Friday"" or ""I'm cold turkeying as soon as this runs out"" is up to you, but set a point at which you'll have to force yourself to cold turkey, and go through with it. Take off work and get ready for the process.


It's critical that you avoid ""tapering down"" as an excuse to keep using. If you're out of dope and you convince yourself to buy more just so you can taper, you're still using and you're not quitting. When you make the decision to cold turkey, you need to jump. Now. It's like a Band-Aid, just yank that thing off and get it over with.

, When your cold turkey date rolls around, it's time to destroy all your works, your needles, your dirty spoons, flush your dope, get rid of the empty baggies lying around, even throw out your belt if you need to. Delete your dealer's number. Get rid of anything you associate with taking heroin in preparation for cold turkey. Make it impossible to use.


If you don't trust yourself to really make it impossible, get help. Let a trusted friend, family member, or sponsor go through all your drawers with you and take everything away. Don't throw it in the kitchen garbage, destroy it by smashing it with a hammer and having someone else throw it away at an undisclosed location., Have someone come over and help prepare your place, stocking up on the necessary supplies for enduring withdrawal, if you're going to cold turkey there, or check yourself into a safe place like a hotel or a friend's house where you'll be able to spend the week in quiet, and have them clean out your place for you while you're in the middle of it. Either way, wipe a week off your schedule and get ready for hell.


Get someone to check up on you regularly throughout the hard week to come, or better yet, get someone to stay with you and see you through the process. It can be a dark and lonely feeling cold turkeying all by yourself. So don't.

, The single most important thing you'll need is lots and lots of drinking water and time. It's essential that you stay fully hydrated while you're in the throws of cold turkey and that you cut yourself off from your life as an addict while you're going through withdrawal. Fluids, over-the-counter flu medication, and some food you'll be able to stomach like peanut butter and soup will help make the process a lot easier, as well as enough clothes to change into and out of., Drink as much as you can stomach. Night sweats and diarrhea will be a problem, both of which can dehydrate you quickly, so make sure you've got plenty of water and you're keeping it down as best you can. Gatorade helps keep your electrolytes and your blood sugar up, while grapefruit juice can provide essential vitamins. Likewise, straight up multi-vitamins and isotonic mixtures do wonders.


If drinks other than water nauseate you, try to water them down to drink them. Gatorade will really help keep your electrolytes up, which is essential. Cut the drink with some water and keep it down. You've got this.

, There's no use beating around the bush: Heroin withdrawal will feel like the worst flu you've ever had, and it'll last for several relentless days. Common symptoms include severe night sweats, nausea, and diarrhea, so it's a good idea to keep some flu medication around and take it as needed to keep the symptoms in check and help you get some rest.


In preparation, sometimes it helps to take a dose of milk of magnesia (magnesium hydroxide, a laxative) a few days before you start, while you're still tapering down, to clear out your system and make the diarrhea somewhat milder during cold turkey.
Some have found success in taking large doses (30-40 mg) of Imodium for the first couple of days during the worst part of cold turkey, and then starting to taper down to avoid constipation. Try to space out the OTC drugs you take, if any, and avoid abusing them.
Natural alternatives like Valerian are also popular and effective in calming your nerves and softening the nausea you'll experience. Since it even binds to the same brain receptors, think of it like herbal Valium that's cheap and available at Walmart.

, Bread and peanut butter can save your life during cold turkey. It's going to be hard to keep anything down, but forcing yourself to eat a few bites of peanut butter sandwich will help give you strength and help you feel human. Keep some broth or ramen on hand to heat up and vary the routine a little, but whatever you do, try to eat a little bit every day to stay as human as possible.

, Have a pile of bedsheets handy because the night sweats can be rough. Change your clothes and underwear every day. try to keep yourself as clean as possible, if for no other reason than to distract yourself. Take warm baths when it feels appropriate and rest up. You're fighting the good fight, so try to relax as much as possible and rest.


Feeling extremely cold chills will be common for you throughout cold turkey (that's why it's called cold turkey). Warm baths can feel really great, keeping you warm and close to normal. When you're feeling the chills come on and you can't get warm, jump in the bath or the shower and let the steam work on you.

, It might sound ridiculous, or like the last thing that you'd want to do, but going for a long walk or jog is the single most effective way of relieving the leg cramps and chill-pains you're going to feel throughout the process. Sometimes it's even as if you don't have any symptoms at all when you're using your body to get some exercise. Force yourself to move around and then reward yourself with a warm bath. Take those first few steps toward being clean.

, You're fighting the hardest fight you'll ever be in. It's not going to be fun, but you're doing the first necessary work of quitting heroin for good and reclaiming your life. You're not a slave to dope. Prove it.

Assess your amphetamine use honestly.,
Evaluate the impact of your amphetamine use on your life.,
Acknowledge your problem.",How to Overcome an Amphetamine Addiction1," It can be hard to admit that your drug use is out of control, but be honest with yourself about how much you are taking and how frequently you are using it. This may help you to realistically view your issue and can help motivate you toward positive change and create goals for yourself.


Ask yourself: How much time are you devoting to your habit? How much money are you spending to support your habit?
Focus on accepting the reality that you may be spending a lot of time and money using amphetamines. The more you accept it, the more likely you will be motivated toward positive change.This is perhaps due to the idea that acceptance helps us admit and own our weaknesses, which is necessary to modify our behaviors.;
, Again, this can be difficult to do honestly, but try to think about how your amphetamine use has affected your life. For example, did you know that amphetamine use can cause all sorts of negative consequences such as impaired attention, memory, decision-making, impulse control, planning and learning?In some cases, excessive amphetamine use can lead to paranoia and psychosis.Identifying these negative consequences can help motivate you toward positive change.


Ask yourself: Have you lost friends or let important relationships suffer? Have you been performing poorly at school or work? Is your health suffering as a result of your amphetamine use? Is your habit likely to cause legal problems (or has it already)?

, It may be challenging to admit that you have a problem. Individuals commonly think they are in control and that they “can stop at any time.” The first step to getting better, though, is admitting that you have a problem.You may have an Amphetamine Use Disorder are if you are: taking amphetamines in larger amounts or for longer periods of time than you intended, wanting to reduce your use but not being able to, spending a lot of time or energy getting/using/recovering from amphetamines, and craving amphetamines.Tolerance is another symptom of Amphetamine Use Disorder. This means you are tolerating higher amounts of amphetamines over time and needing more in order to get the same effect.Another symptom of Amphetamine Use Disorder is if you experience symptoms of withdrawal (you experience unpleasant mental and physical side effects when you stop taking the drug).
Additionally, if you are not able to complete work or home obligations due to amphetamine use, or you are having relationship problems due to your use, you may have a substance use disorder.Have compassion for yourself and accept that you have a problem.

Apply cold to your muscle.",How to Treat Recurring Muscle Cramps2," This is the best way to relieve your cramp. If the cramp is in your calf, stand on the cramping leg with your knee bent. If you are unable to stand, sit down with your leg straight and pull the top of your foot towards your head. Applying pressure can be a simple way to bring your cramped muscle into a relaxed position. This will also stretch your hamstring if it is cramping.If your quadricep (front of your thigh) is cramping, support yourself with a chair and pull the cramping leg towards your buttocks.Hold each stretch for 30 seconds and then release.

Ice can also be applied if your muscle is sore or tender after the cramping has stopped.Wrap the ice pack using a thin towel, so that you don’t cause any injury due to excessively low temperatures, such as a frostbite.


Allow the ice to remain on your muscle for 20 minutes and then remove the ice for 20 minutes before reapplying.Freeze water in a Dixie cup and use it to massage your muscle. You should massage the area until it is numb."

Consider using prescription medication to ease the effects of withdrawal.,
Explore free or low cost options in your area.,
Find a state subsidized methadone clinic in your area.,
Talk to your doctor about the Suboxone or Subutex approach.,
Prepare for the doctor's questions.,
Ask about other prescription drugs to curb the withdrawal symptoms.,
Commit to secondary withdrawal.,
Consider attending a rehabilitative detox facility, if you can afford it.",How to Quit Using Heroin2," If the option is available, using certain prescription drugs in a controlled and careful environment can be a more effective method of kicking heroin for good. You can monitor your intake more carefully, curbing the withdrawal symptoms and keeping yourself feeling relatively normal while you quit heroin.


While you run the risk of further addictions to other drugs, learning more about ""warm turkey"" methods can help ensure that you don't fall into their possible traps.

, The problem with warm turkeying, as opposed to quitting cold turkey, is that it costs money you might not have, and requires health insurance you might not be able to get. Call the Substance Abuse hotline 1-800-662-HELP (4357) to find out more about free or reduced clinics in your area you can learn more about and speak with to explore your options.


To avoid becoming addicted to other prescription drugs, don't rely on the same old chain of dealers that resulted in you having to quit heroin in the first place. Don't try it on your own. Do it the smart way, by getting the professional medical help that's available to you and taking drugs as recommended.

, Methadone is an opioid agonist that's administered in a regulated manner at clinics, many of which are free or quite cheap, to help heroin users who hope to quit manage the symptoms of withdrawal and taper down in a supervised manner. It'll still be up to you to negotiate your quitting, but getting drug tested and checked out by physicians while you do it can help curb the psychological trauma of heroin withdrawal for some users. You're doing the right thing.Try to start with as low a dose as possible. Some clinics start with doses in excess of 70mg, making it ""too easy"" on some users who hope to quit more quickly and effectively. Communicate with the staff and let them know your intention of quitting, not dragging out the process. If you're healthy enough for a lower dose, try to force yourself to start smaller.
It's unfortunately common for heroin users to become dependent on methadone, or even become double-dippers, who take methadone in the morning and begin using heroin later in the day when the effect wears off. Methadone isn't right for everyone, but it's usually the cheapest option, especially if you can apply and qualify for insurance aid in your state.

, Suboxone or Subutex is sometimes less of a hassle than getting on methadone, and will greatly help with cravings. For some, it's also much easier to taper off than methadone. The amount of time you will take Suboxone/Subutex is much shorter than Methadone as well-- maintenance generally lasts for 3 to 6 months, depending on the person and doctor. , It's important to be totally honest with any clinicians or doctors you consult about your addiction if you want prescription drugs to help quit heroin. Coming up with elaborate fantasy tales to tell as a way of getting a couple of Xanax could start a chain reaction in which you're rejected, get angry, and end up using again to manage the dope sickness. Come clean. If your goal is to quit heroin altogether, tell the doctor your intentions. They can help.


You may need to agree to take periodic drug tests, HIV screens, and undergo other procedures to be admitted to state-run clinics. Getting on prescription drugs can be a much more involved process than getting a couple of pills, so prepare to be run through the gauntlet.

, If you don't want to go on methadone, or cheap options aren't available in your area, talk to your doctor about a prescription for other drugs that can help make the withdrawal process somewhat softer. As long as you take them in a smart and controlled manner, this can be an effective way of quitting. Never abuse prescription drugs while quitting heroin.Clonidine is a non-narcotic BP med, given by most addiction doctors, quite effective at managing your withdrawal symptoms, especially anxiety associated with the process.

Valium and Xanax are benzodiazepines effective in treating addiction, battling insomnia, and treating your anxiety.

Phenobarbital and Ativan are relatively-weak narcotics that are sometimes prescribed to help take the edge off.

Tramadol is a painkiller sometimes prescribed specifically to combat leg pain or restless-leg syndrome and has proven quite effective in soften the restlessness associated with withdrawal.

, The biggest problem with warm turkey methods of quitting heroin is that, ultimately, you're still on dope. It may have a different name, but if you're still daily using drugs to function, you're not quit yet. Whatever you're taking, you must also commit to going through the difficult work of quitting altogether and getting sober.Depending on your method of warming the turkey, your secondary withdrawal might be brief and mild, or it might be a close cousin to heroin. It may take several weeks before you start feeling normal again. Go through the same process of selecting a quitting date and committing to it.

, The warmest turkey would be a private rehab clinic you can go to while you experience withdrawal under full surveillance, receiving medical care, psychological care, and time away from your life as an addict. Unfortunately, a full rehab package for several weeks can cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $10,000.


These packages are often the end result of family interventions and can actually serve to make addicts feel extremely guilty because of the associated cost. If you cold turkey alone and end up reusing, you might feel disappointed in yourself, but if you withdraw at a place that's costing your parents thousands of dollars a night, you might feel much more terrible and guilty. Don't let it get to the point where such a situation becomes necessary.

Understand that surviving your withdrawal is not the same as quitting.,
Address your mental addiction.,
Learn to process and anticipate your euphoric recall.,
Be prepared for the lows.,
Start talking to people.",How to Quit Using Heroin3," Quitting heroin is not like quitting booze, quitting cigarettes, it's not even like quitting cocaine. The physical and psychological halves of addiction are equally potent and equally difficult to negotiate. Heroin is the hardest drug to quit, and many addicts who've successfully negotiated their difficult physical withdrawal have ended up using again because they don't equally weigh the psychological withdrawal that will occur. Once you've made it through the initial weeks or months of kicking your habit, the work of life begins.

, If you're going to quit and stay quit, you've got to come clean and be honest with yourself: you're an addict. You may always be an addict. You've got to accept that this thing about you may never change--you may always want that shot or that line, your addiction may always be waiting out in the parking lot to beat you up, steal your wallet, and ruin your life. Quitting heroin means making a conscious choice to avoid that addiction, one day at a time.


It's hard to think of quitting when you think, ""I can't ever do this again, for the rest of my life."" Don't worry about the rest of your life. Worry about getting to 5 o'clock pm without using. Then start worrying about getting to next Monday without using.

, Very quickly you may start obsessing about how great another shot or line will be, letting the memory of all of the pain and problems that follow it recede into the background and only focusing on wanting to use again. You may even start to feel hints of the euphoria of making a buy and taking it back to your place, obsessing over and over about the process of scoring. Learn to manage these cravings and cut them off at the pass.

, After the initial period of two weeks or two months, you may reach a holding pattern where things can seem boring, lifeless, as if the world were a boring black and white movie you have to sit through at school. This time period is when most addicts relapse, often with disastrous results. Depression is a serious problem for recovering addicts, making it important to get busy and start living your sober life.

, Narcotics Anonymous meetings can be extremely helpful in giving addicts a structure and community of people who are feeling the same things. You're not alone in your struggle, and listening to other peoples' stories and having a venue in which to tell your own can be uplifting and freeing to many people. Find a local NA meeting by clicking here.


Alternatively, NA can really turn some addicts off. If the idea of spending several hours a week listening to other addicts talk endlessly about using drugs, or if you think that may drive you to use again, seek other social groups that can fulfill a similar hole. Check out bowling leagues, card groups, or any other kinds of sober social organizations that will give you people to talk to about a common subject or interest.
Talking to a therapist can be restorative and instructive for many addicts. Deciding to confront your addiction means talking about it, coming clean with it, and being able to discuss it with someone who won't judge you or your life.

Maintain drug highs in other, healthier ways.,
Own your body by exercising.,
Use your sobriety as an opportunity to quit other drugs you may use.,
Own your body by eating healthy food.,
Find new hobbies to occupy your time.,
Let yourself relax.",How to Quit Using Heroin4," A common facet of 12-step programs, whether you choose to participate in one or not, is that you recognize periods of sobriety and reward yourself for them. Even if the reward means the opportunity to look at your sober self in the mirror and say, ""You've been sober for a week,"" it's important to let yourself celebrate the achievements of sobriety.


Some addicts find it helpful to put all the money they used to set aside for dope and save it up to buy something nice for big sober milestones. Take a trip, or buy something nice for yourself. You deserve it.

, Temptations will happen. It will occur to you eventually that you'll want to score again, to use again, and to feel that feeling. Most relapses occur in the first 3-6 months of quitting heroin.While you might not be able to stop that old bird from landing in your mind, you don't have to let it build up a nest and stay. Some addicts find it helpful to visualize a ""trash bin"" in a corner of your mind where you can place those temptations, locking them away as soon as they surface.


When you get a temptation, picture the garbage can and picture your temptation as a piece of trash. Put it in the can. Screw the lid on it. Keep it out of sight.

, So you kicked dope. Now what? Boredom can quickly become one of the biggest challenges to a recovering addict. How you choose to fill all that time you used to spend high will be completely up to you, but you're likely to be more successful if you can find a way of productively and healthily reproducing a similar kind of ""high."" This might mean creating something, taking up challenging sports that'll leave you exhilarated, or even something as simple as going for long walks and thinking. Use your sobriety as an opportunity to create a new life. It's a blank page. Start filling it.

, Your body isn't a slave to heroin. Exercise helps the body excrete all the junk inside, like a natural detox, regulating metabolism and creating natural endorphin highs. Find a regular kind of exercise that you enjoy and that you'll be able to keep up regularly. Play sports or jog. If you can't stand exercise, start going to dance clubs and getting wild. Have fun. You're sober!

, Generally, addicts aren't encouraged to try to give everything up all at once in formal rehab programs. Learn how you're able to cope with sobriety, however, by eliminating as many addictive substances as you can from your life and replacing them with other productive activity.


If you replace your heroin high with other drugs, it may work for a short period of time, but it'll also likely keep you hanging around the same types of people, facing the same types of temptations, and you won't be sober. Know yourself.
If you're still fighting a big battle against heroin temptations and feel like a couple cigarettes a day is your only sane lifeline, don't try to quit right away. Learn your own limitations and set a series of goals for yourself. If you want to quit everything, by when? Next week? Next month? Set a date for quitting pot or booze or cigarettes if it fits in with your goals for your life.

, The concept of eating and enjoying food can be a baffling thing to some addicts, but taking care of your sobriety by embracing a healthy diet can help restore nutrients to your body and keep you healthy.

, Avoid old haunts and old drug buddies, cultivating new sober acquaintances and exploring new hobbies that'll keep you occupied. If you're busy doing other things, heroin is much less likely to creep back into your life.


It may be unfortunate but it's sometimes necessary to sever old friendships with people likely to suck you back into the drug world you crawled out of. You have to be smart and take control of your own sobriety. If you worry that hanging around a certain person might tempt you to use again, you've got to avoid that person. Tell them you don't trust yourself yet to be around them, but you'd love to see them get clean.

, Depressions, guilt, and addictions can sometimes seem like they're lurking around every corner for the addict. Try to look through the windshield instead of the rear-view mirror. Don't focus on the things you've done, and the things that you might regret, focus on where you're going and what you are going to accomplish with your new sober life. Start living it.

Talk to a medical doctor.,
Explore medication options for the reduction of amphetamine use.,
Get psychological treatment.,
Consider different options for recovery.",How to Overcome an Amphetamine Addiction2," Amphetamine use should be treated like a medical condition or illness.If at all possible, see a doctor to discuss your amphetamine use and talk about how best to overcome it. A medical doctor can help you decide which method is best for you. A doctor can also recommend treatment centers and other resources.


If you do not currently have a physician, contact your medical insurance company to find one. If you do not have medical insurance you can find a free or low-cost clinic in your area. Also, check with your local government for medical services or benefits for low-income families.
If you are prescribed amphetamines by your medical doctor or psychiatrist, discuss your issue with the doctor who prescribed it.
If you are using methamphetamine, an illegal substance, you can usually discuss this openly with your doctor without fear of legal issues due to doctor-patient-confidentiality laws. Make sure you ask the doctor about the limits of confidentiality (if you are a danger to yourself or others).

, Medications such as Naltrexone (Vivitrol), and Bupropion (Wellbutrin) have been implicated in the treatment and reduction of amphetamine use.Consult with your primary care doctor or psychiatrist.

, Treatment options such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) help to reduce or eliminate amphetamine use.CBT is a therapy modality that focuses on changing your thinking in order to change your feelings and behaviors.


Speak to a clinical psychologist (PsyD, PhD), marriage and family therapist (MFT), or other licensed clinician. You can typically get contact information for therapists via your medical insurance company.

, You’ll have two major options for eliminating your amphetamine use: you’ll either tapper down under the direction of a doctor, or seek a detox program. It is not recommended that you quit all at once (cold turkey). Whatever you chose, you will need to have a plan or a treatment program in place to support your recovery.


Think about the possibility of a detoxification program - an inpatient unit where therapist and medical professionals can evaluate you closely through the process of detoxification. Rehabilitation and detox treatment centers can be the best places to detoxify your system, but these solutions are not for everyone as they can be costly.
Consider looking for a support group in your area. These groups often meet at community centers and other locations to talk and offer mutual support. Find out what is available before you start detoxing, so that you’ll have a plan in place once things get tough.

Anticipate and prepare for the symptoms of withdrawal.,
Consider medication for withdrawal symptoms.,
Stick to a daily routine.,
Cope with your cravings.,
Focus on new habits.",How to Overcome an Amphetamine Addiction3," When you stop taking amphetamines, you may experience withdrawal symptoms and strong cravings for the drug.Prepare for these issues in advance by preparing a safe environment for detoxification. Ideally, you want to stay someplace where amphetamines are not available, where you cannot access the drug easily, and where you are unlikely to encounter any friends or relatives who use the drug.


Consider choosing a major change of scenery. If possible, go to a supportive friend’s or relative’s house, rather than staying at your own place. It can be easier to break the cycle of addiction if you are in unfamiliar surroundings.
Consider going to a drug treatment facility or rehab program.

, Know, in advance, who will support you when you have withdrawal symptoms or strong cravings. Professionals – doctors and therapists – fall into this category, as do members of support groups, close relatives, and good friends, as long as none of these people are using drugs.


It may be helpful to make a list of all of the people you can contact during your detox. Make sure you have emergency phone numbers available, as well as doctor’s contact information, and your closest hospital address.

, As your body adjusts to the absence of any amphetamine, you will begin to experience withdrawal symptoms, the most severe being within the first 24 hours. Then, the severity will typically taper off in about 2-3 weeks.Common withdrawal symptoms include: increased sleeping and eating, depressed mood, concentration issues, irritability, feelings of anxiety, fatigue, vivid or unpleasant dreams, and cravings.Expect these withdrawal symptoms, and try to spin them in as positive a light as you can by thinking thoughts such as, “This is my body getting clean; these are the obstacles I have to face to get to the other side. I am strong enough to get through it.”

, If you are working with a physician or treatment center, ask about medications to help you manage your withdrawal symptoms. These medications may not completely eliminate the withdrawal symptoms, but they can reduce them. One medication that may help to reduce amphetamine withdrawal symptoms is Reboxetine (Edronax).If you are prescribed medication, take it as scheduled, and follow up regularly with your doctor.

, Having structure to your day and keeping busy can help you manage withdrawal symptoms. The less time you sit around thinking about amphetamines and focusing on how terrible withdrawal feels, the better.


Eat and sleep on a regular schedule. Make sure you are eating healthfully (plenty of fruits, vegetables, and protein). Sleep at least 8 hours per day, but try not to sleep more than 10 hours.
Have a plan to fill the other hours, too. Make a to-do-list or a schedule for your day. Take this time to complete tasks that you normally don't get to (cleaning out a closet or sending emails you've been avoiding).

, During the initial withdrawal period, you may experience very strong drug cravings. Develop coping mechanisms to reduce the likelihood of giving in.


If your craving is very strong and you fear you might give in, try telling yourself to wait just an hour. Then try for another. Breaking up withdrawal into shorter, more manageable periods of time may help you cope. Be strong, and know that it will get easier with time.
Distract yourself, try to think about something else, and be proud of whatever self-control you can manage to exert.
Try prayer or meditation. The initial withdrawal period can be very difficult. You might find that prayer or meditation helps you stay calm and feel stronger and more at peace.

, As the strong physical symptoms of withdrawal begin to subside, turn your energies to healthy habits.


Try relaxing activities like reading and gardening.
Engage in positive physical activities such as exercise and cooking.
Focus on whatever activities keep you occupied without exposing you to people and places you associate with your amphetamine use.

"
Continue to adhere to your daily routine.,
Stick with your counseling program or support group.,
Celebrate milestones.,
Surround yourself with the right people.,
Watch for warning signs.",How to Overcome an Amphetamine Addiction4," If a regular structure to your day helped you get through the initial withdrawal period, it may also help you conquer your addiction long-term. Adjust your schedule as necessary, but keep the good habits that you’ve developed already.


Make sure you continue to manage any medications you are taking and have regular trips to your medical doctor., Don’t stop taking advantage of these resources just because you are feeling better. Recovery from addiction is a process, so continue to check in with your doctor, therapist, or support group. If this begins to feel burdensome, try thinking of it like eating right or exercising. It’s something you do regularly to stay healthy, even when you’d rather not.

, Thinking about the rest of your life can be overwhelming, so stop and celebrate your accomplishments periodically: two weeks clean, a month, three months, a year.


After even a day or week sober you can treat yourself to something you enjoy like a nice dinner or a trip to the beach. Focus on what you have done well and take the time to set goals for the next week.
After a month of sobriety you can celebrate by having a clean and sober party (with no alcohol, drugs).

, Build healthy friendships and stronger personal relationships. Resist the urge to start spending time with the people with whom you used to use amphetamines.


You can set specific boundaries with individuals who use amphetamines by saying something like, ""I am focusing on my sobriety and am still in the early stages of recovery, so I can't be around people who use right now. It is too risky for me and I hope you will understand that.""
Cultivate new relationships with individuals who do not use alcohol or drugs or any kind. Try signing up for a gym, dance class, church group, or any other social activity.

, If you notice increased cravings, feelings of hopelessness, or a lot of additional stress, you may be at risk for a relapse. During these times, it is especially important to avoid people, places, and situations you associate with amphetamine use. Stay strong, and focus on what you’ve accomplished.


If you do use amphetamines again and regret it, try not to beat yourself up – that won’t help. Remember that you stopped once; you can do it again. Get help immediately, and get back on track.

, Never keep yours feelings bottled up, it will only cause more problems. Make sure that the person that you choose for your buddy system is trustworthy and is sincere about helping you. Make sure that the one you choose is someone that you can talk to about anything in your life and preferably is someone that you have known for many years.

Adopt a frantic, high-pitched tone when angry or excited.,
Mimic Stitch in a mirror.,
Record yourself.,
Practice.",How to Talk Like Stitch," To best talk like Stitch, you’ll have to familiarize yourself with his voice and manner and speaking. Watch Lilo and Stitch a few times or if you’ve already seen it, seek out clips of Stitch on YouTube. This will give you an opportunity to focus on his mannerisms and manner of speaking. What differentiates Stitch’s voice from that of the other characters?, Based on your observations while watching Stitch in the movie and online, write down some notes about what makes Stitch’s voice distinct. Is his pitch high or low? Is his voice nasal or throaty? By distilling the characteristics that make Stitch sound like Stitch, you can best try to emulate him., Stitch uses some Hawaiian words in the movie that may be unfamiliar to you. Work on pronouncing the two he uses most often, ohana, meaning family, and aloha, meaning hello and goodbye. By breaking these words down into their individual syllables, you can sound them out and master them in no time., To best emulate Stitch’s voice, pull your tongue back against your back molars, closing some of the space near the back of your throat. Then, speak from deep in your throat, creating as much vibration as possible. This will force more air out of your nose to create Stitch’s signature nasal sound., The pacing of Stitch’s speech slows down when he talks about happy topics, like family. When you’re mimicking dialog where Stich expresses happiness, slow your cadence to sound more like he does.

, The pacing of Stitch’s speech picks up when he is being cheeky. If you’re reciting a mischievous line of dialog, rush your speech and shift your voice to a higher register, just as Stitch does. Your enthusiasm will naturally come through.

, Stitch has a distinct, toothy grin. To best speak like Stitch, make your mouth as open and wide as possible, exposing your teeth when you talk. You may find that doing this alone makes you sound more like Stitch.Practice speaking like Stitch in front of a mirror so you can tweak your expressions.
To make your impersonation most convincing, incorporate body language. Stitch often uses his claws to emphasize his points. Bend your fingers to shape your hands into makeshift claws.

, To practice your impression use a voice recording app, such as Voice Memos, to create mini recordings of you speaking as Stitch. What parts of your impression are most or least successful? By recording yourself, you can track your progress in mimicking Stitch’s speech over time.If there are words or phrases where your impersonation seems to consistently fall short, go back and review more clips of Stitch saying those key phrases.

, Your impersonation will improve the more you practice it. Work on speaking like Stitch a few times a week to polish your impression. Over time, you’ll get closer and closer to sounding just like him!

Talk to them.,
Gently shake the person.,
Make a loud noise.",How to Tell if Someone Is Unconscious or Sleeping1," Someone who is asleep will respond to stimuli. One way to determine if someone is sleeping is by talking to them. Kneel or bend next to the person and gently say their name, tell them to open their eyes, or ask them if they are all right. Repeat this for five minutes or until the person wakes up.For example, “Jim, are you awake? If you can hear me, open your eyes. Jim?”;
, Place your hand on their shoulder and gently shake them. You can do this in combination with saying their name or asking if they are awake. Do not shake them aggressively, shake their head, slap, or flick their face.You can also try gently rubbing their cheek or head/forehead to wake the person up.

, Turning on the radio or TV, closing the door, loudly tapping on something, or playing an instrument may prompt someone to wake up, as well. However, do not play or make loud noises too close to the person’s ear. This may startle the person or cause damage to their hearing."

Relax your body.",How to Take a Really Great Nap," Planning ahead for a time in your day when your body can catch up on zzz’s will help your body prepare for sleep when it comes. Additionally, just knowing a nap is coming is enough to lower your blood pressure. If possible, plan to have a nap every day. Having a regularly scheduled nap will help your body adjust to the routine and make it easier to fall asleep.
If you have trouble working in a nap, consider short amounts of free time like breaks between classes, your lunch hour, or even a five or ten minute break from work. People take breaks to smoke, so why shouldn't you take a break to nap?;
, If you were entirely free to plan your day and had no commitments, what time would you naturally get up and go to sleep? Sticking as close as you can to your body’s natural rhythm will help you feel like you get the most out of your sleep.Most people experience a “dip” in their level of alertness around mid-afternoon, and that is typically the best time for a nap.Typically, a good rule of thumb is to time your nap about 6-8 hours after you wake up., The length of your nap depends on how long you have to sleep, and how alert you want to be after you wake up.Taking a short nap can be energizing, but a long nap may cause you to fall into a deep sleep that's hard to wake from.


Naps of 20-30 minutes can help to improve mood, alertness and performance, without the grogginess that results from longer sleep. When your nap is under 45 minutes, you spend most of the time in Stage 2 sleep, which can increase concentration and alertness, sharpen motor skills, and elevate your mood while minimizing ""sleep inertia"" (the feeling of grogginess and disorientation after waking). If you sleep 45 minutes or more, your body will slip into a deep, slow-wave sleep. When you wake from this sleep, you may experience sleep inertia (the feeling of grogginess and disorientation after waking), though it will help if you’re feeling behind on sleep (though not as much as sleeping 90 minutes or more).A full sleep cycle takes at least 90 minutes. Napping for 90 minutes or longer will reduce sleep inertia, because you will wake from REM sleep., Don’t waste a lot of time trying to get to sleep; find a place where you can lie down and stay comfortable. Lying down is best; it can actually take 50 percent longer for you to fall asleep while sitting upright.If you're at home, the obvious place to nap is your bed. At work or school, see if you can use an unoccupied room with a couch. Sneaking away to your car is also an option.
Plan to use the same spot every day. You'll start thinking of it as your napping spot, making it easier to fall asleep quickly.

, A light covering can help you fall asleep. If it's hot outside, a sheet provides comfort without the weight of a blanket. No matter the weather, don’t use a heavy blanket for napping; excess warmth can make you oversleep., Don't let a full bladder wake you up while you are sleeping; use the bathroom before you lie down. Make this part of your daily napping routine. While you're in the bathroom, you might want to wash your face and make other preparations to make your body more comfortable, just as you might before going to bed at night.


Consider brushing your teeth if you're napping after lunch.
You may want to change your clothes, too. If you're not at home, remove your shoes at the very least.

, If you are worried you might be disturbed, lock the door. You can put a sign outside the door letting others know when you will be available. Once the door is locked, you'll be able to rest more easily, since you won't be anticipating someone walking in.

, Take a break from answering calls. You will still be able to use the alarm function on the phone even if it is silenced or on vibrate. It's important to silence your phone, even if you aren't expecting a call, so you can forget about the possibility that it might ring.

, Keeping light and noise to a minimum will help you get to sleep and stay asleep.If you don't have blinds or curtains on the window, put a sheet over it so you can block out the light. If you are unable to control your environment, use a sleep mask or noise-canceling earbuds to reduce noise and light.

, Our thoughts and worries always seem to get louder when we lie down to fall asleep. Try different exercises to quiet your mind. Making a habit of doing these exercises will help lull you to sleep more quickly. .


Use a mantra, a short repeated phrase, to center your mind.
Visualize a relaxing place like a beach or a forest to help clear your thoughts.Count sheep.

, Breathe slowly and deeply to help your body relax. If you feel like you’re holding tension in your body, concentrate on tightening, then relaxing your muscle groups one at a time. Doing some light stretches before lying down for a nap can also be helpful."

Ask them questions.,
Check their breathing.",How to Tell if Someone Is Unconscious or Sleeping2," If the person wakes up, then check for the following symptoms: amnesia, headache, confusion, lightheadedness, drowsiness, or a rapid heartbeat. Also, check to see if they have the ability to move all of their body parts.Ask them, “How do you feel?” “Can you wiggle your toes and move your fingers?” and “Do you feel any pain or discomfort in your chest?”
If the person is unresponsive, then check for a loss of bladder or bowel control, i.e., incontinence. If incontinence is present, then call 911.

If it is due to dehydration or heat, move them to a cool place and give them water or Gatorade to drink.

, Kneel by their side and place their arm closest to you at a right angle to their body with their palm facing up. Place their other hand across their chest with the back of their palm lying flat against their cheek. Hold this arm in place with your hand. Then, with your other hand, pull their farther knee up and over their other leg until their foot is flat on the ground. Gently pull on their lifted knee and roll them toward you until they are on their side. Now they are in a recovery position.You should do this if the person is unresponsive for more than a minute, but still breathing and lying on their back.
If you think the victim has a spinal injury, do not roll or move them.

, Once the person is in the recovery position, call 911 for emergency medical help. Keep monitoring their breathing until the medics arrive.

In most cases, doctors can identify the underlying physical cause of night sweats. In rare cases, night sweats are idiopathic or without a cause. Ask your doctor if any of the following medical conditions might be the cause of your night sweats:


Ask your doctor if your night sweats are a symptom of menopause.Ask your doctor if your night sweats are related to your cancer or cancer treatment. Lymphoma often causes night sweats.

Find a private location.,
Adjust the temperature.,
Turn on some music or a sound machine.,
Change into comfortable clothes or rest on a pillow or blanket.,
Decide when to catnap.,
Choose how long you'd like to nap.,
Set an alarm.,
Give yourself time to wake up.",How to Take Catnaps," Most people prefer to nap in private since there could be many distractions in public places. If you're not home when you need to nap, consider napping in your office or in your car. if you don't have a car or office, ask if there's a private conference room you could use for a while. Leave a sign on the door stating that you shouldn't be disturbed. Try to find somewhere you can stretch out, lie down, recline or lean back.


When choosing a place to nap, consider how busy the space is, the noise level, and how comfortable it is.;
, See if you can lower the thermostat to a temperature that is warm enough to be comfortable, but not too hot. Most people sleep better in slightly lower temperatures than their normal working environment. Cool temperatures can help you fall asleep and sleep better. If you can't adjust the temperature, try to wrap yourself in a blanket or warm jacket.If you can, dim the lights. This may help you fall asleep faster, especially if you're in an office with bright fluorescent lighting.

, Some people have no problem sleeping with background or distraction noises. But if you find that noises keep you from catching a catnap, try to turn on a white noise machine or download a white noise app onto your smartphone. This can help drown out distracting sounds so you can relax and sleep. Most sound machines create a static noise or offer soothing sounds like waves or water.If you don't have a white noise machine, you can turn on a fan to create noise or close windows and doors to block out sounds.

, Remove or loosen any restrictive clothing so you can rest properly. Take off your jacket or tie, un-tuck your shirt or slip off your shoes to get more comfortable. Loosen your belt or, if you're at home, change into more comfortable clothes.


You might want to keep comfortable slippers or a soft jacket in your office or car so that you can easily nap. Maybe even keep a pillow or blanket in your car.

, Rather than wait to become exhausted, spend a few minutes in the morning looking at your schedule for the day. Look for a time slot that is open for at least 15 to 20 minutes. This way, you won't miss any appointments and you'll know what's planned for immediately after your nap. Most people find that they have a regular afternoon slump. It may help to schedule your nap for a few hours after lunch.If you usually start dragging by a certain time of day, try to schedule your nap for before that time. This may prevent your usual afternoon tiredness and give you a burst of much-needed energy. A good nap time might be during your lunch hour if you have the time.

, Most catnaps are short naps of around 10 to 15 minutes. Although some people may prefer to sleep for 20 to 30 minutes, research shows that just a 10 minute nap can help a person recover from a night of sleep deprivation. The benefits of such a short nap usually last between one and three hours.Longer naps (over 30 minutes) can make you feel groggy when you wake up, but can make you feel more energetic in the long run (for several hours)., If you really need a nap, don't rely on your own internal clock to wake yourself up or you may find yourself sleeping too long. If you sleep too long (over 15 to 20 minutes), you may affect your nighttime sleep pattern, making it harder to fall asleep at night. Set an alarm That gives you enough time to get a good nap 15 to 20 minutes.Avoid hitting the snooze button when your alarm goes off. Falling asleep between brief snoozes will only make you groggy. Which can ruin the rest of your work day.

, When you wake up, consider how you feel. If you feel awake and alert, the length of your nap was good. But if you wake up groggy and tired, you might have slept too long. Even if you take a brief catnap, you may feel like it takes a while to fully wake up. If you can, avoid doing detailed or challenging tasks for the first 20 to 30 minutes after you wake up.Researchers are still studying whether people get any benefit from making themselves take a nap when they don't feel like it. Evidence suggests that only people who feel tired and need to nap actually benefit from taking a catnap."

Watch his eyelids.,
Observe her breathing.,
Flick the sleeper's upper cheek.,
Check for signs of unusual habits.",How to Tell if Someone Is Asleep1," A sleeping person's eyelids are gently closed, not tightly scrunched together. During REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, his eyes visibly move underneath the eyelid in rapid, short movements. REM sleep typically doesn't occur until 90 minutes after the person falls asleep, and then only in 10 to 60 minute stages.So while anyone with rapidly moving eyes is almost certainly asleep, calm eyes won't necessarily tell you anything.;
, Sleeping people have a more regular, slightly slower breathing rate than an awake person. There are exceptions, such as dreaming people and sufferers of sleep apnea, who breathe in more irregular patterns.A faking person will almost always try to imitate a slow, regular pattern, but as this takes concentration, the pattern will often change within a couple minutes.

, Gently flick your index or middle finger off your thumb and onto the sleeper's upper cheek. Repeat two or three times. If you notice the sleeper's eye twitch in response, he is awake.Like many of these tests, the obnoxious sensation may cause fakers to admit the deception on their own.


Snapping fingers in front of the eye or brushing eyelashes with fingers can cause similar reactions.

, Most people have bedtime rituals, at least including turning off the light, dressing for bed, and getting into bed. Unless someone was exhausted or often takes naps, it's unlikely she's fallen asleep fully clothed in a brightly lit living room.


If you were around before that person ""fell asleep,"" try to remember if she brushed her teeth, ate a bedtime snack, or completed whichever other rituals she normally does.

You should avoid sandwiches with a lot of mayonnaise.
Try to avoid hamburgers.

Seek treatment for underlying medical conditions.,
Try antiperspirants.,
Talk to your doctor about Botox.,
Discuss novel treatments for underarm sweating.,
Ask about oral medications.,
Exercise caution with ETS surgery.",How to Stop Sweating in Your Sleep3," If your doctor determines that your night sweats are caused by a medical condition (menopause, depression, pneumonia, and so on), you will need to develop a treatment plan to treat the cause, which will hopefully clear up your night sweats as well. You treatment will depend on the underlying medical condition, so you will need to talk to your doctor about how to proceed.

, Antiperspirants are topical treatments for excessive sweating in the underarms, feet and hands. They are the least invasive treatment for night sweats, but should only be used in the short-term. Apply the antiperspirant to your underarm, hands, and feet before going to bed and then again in the morning.


Clinical strength antiperspirants can be purchased over the counter. Look for brands that offer clinical strength products.Prescription antiperspirants have aluminum chloride hexahydrate and are amongst the most effective, but need to be used following the instructions of a pharmacist. Some people have skin reactions to aluminum chloride hexahydrate.Antiperspirants can sometimes also be used on the face and head. However, some antiperspirants will cause skin reactions and should not be used on the face. You need to consult your doctor or pharmacist to see if a particular antiperspirant can be used on your face., Botox is commonly used to treat excessive sweating in the underarms, hands, feet, head and face. It is relatively more effective for treating excessive sweating in the underarms and hands, as opposed to treating the feet or the head and face. If antiperspirants are not effective in treating your night sweats, try Botox. If you are getting treatment on the underarms, you should avoid shaving the area during the week prior to treatment.See if your insurance covers Botox for hyperhidrosis. It typically costs around $1,000 for underarm treatment.After your receive Botox treatment, the treated area of your body often stays dry for between four and twelve months., Laser treatment, miraDry, and surgery have been used successfully to specifically treat excessive underarm sweating. If your experience of night sweats is concentrated in the underarm area, discuss the following treatment options with your doctor:


MiraDry is a hand held device that you use to send electromagnetic energy underneath your underarms. This stops the sweat glands from acting up. A number of recent studies have found it to be effective in treating underarm hyperhidrosis and it is FDA approved.Laser treatment is a good option for treating excessive underarm sweating because it is pretty quick and not too invasive. A laser is used to target the responsible sweat glands.Local surgery can be used such as liposuction and excision. These techniques remove or injure the sweat glands under your arms., Oral medications can be given to treat facial sweating or generalized hyperhidrosis. These medications include anticholinergics, beta blockers and benzodiazepines. Ask your doctor if there is an appropriate oral medication for your night sweating., Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy or ETS surgery is the most invasive surgical treatment for hyperhidrosis. ETS is a last resort surgery that comes with a long list of side effects such as compensatory sweating, arrhythmia, and heat intolerance. Typically, physicians will not recommend ETS surgery because of the severity of the side effects."

Take care of yourself.,
Wear subtly sexy clothes.,
On a certain day of the week, wear pink or another girly color (lilac, pastel blue, etc).",How to Seem Like Regina George1," Regina tends to be interested in her body. She's a thin girl who's constantly trying to be as healthily thin as possible. If you're not the skinniest, try to eat healthier to shed some pounds. Go to the gym, join a sport, or take a walk around the block! Anything you can do to have a smaller body.



Going vegan is the best possible way to go on a diet. Even going vegetarian for a little bit can work. Just make sure you're getting all the required proteins and nutrients you need each day.;
, Try to get away with wearing thin straps or showing just a centimeter and a half of cleavage. It'll get attention from some people, but as long as you don't go hardcore (i.e. wearing a strapless mini dress or a deep v-neck) it won't necessarily be negative.


Regina only ever goes full-on sexy for dances and costume parties. That should be the only time you can get away with wearing extremely flashy clothing. Otherwise, keep it to a minimum.

, Make that your colour, and never tell anybody when you wear it besides your clique (which should only be comprised of your closest, most trustworthy friends). If you become popular, and it gets out that you wear that colour with your clique on that day,


If you're going to wear a certain color on Wednesdays, don't make it pink. Mean Girls is a very popular movie, and it's almost certain that somebody will catch on sooner or later.

Start with noise and gentle shaking.,
Drop his hand on his face.,
Know when to let someone be.,
Use the sternal rub only when necessary.,
Use quick, painful methods instead in an emergency.",How to Tell if Someone Is Asleep2," If you encounter someone apparently asleep on the floor or in an uncomfortable position, or suspect a health-threatening injury, medical condition, or drug abuse, do not hesitate to disturb her slumber. Speak loudly and gently shake her by the shoulders. If she does not respond, call for medical assistance or spend no more than a minute trying one of the tests below first.


If the person reacts but is not behaving normally, ask her to wiggle her fingers and open her eyes. If she cannot do this, she needs medical attention.

, Gently lift one of the sleeper's hands and hold it a couple inches (a few centimeters) above his face, then let go. If awake, the person will usually flinch or move his elbow so the hand does not land on his face. A dedicated faker can remain still for this as well.


If this does not work but you're still suspicious, try again with the hand six inches (15 cm) above his face. This time, put your own hand a couple inches (a few centimeters) above the sleeper's face, so you can catch his hand if it falls straight down.

, When someone is already in an ambulance or a hospital bed, and their general status is already known, it is not always necessary to ""call them out"" on a fake. Have a professional check for signs of danger; if none are present, let the person continue to fake sleep until doctors require her to be awake.


In non-urgent hospital situations such as the arrival of a meal or the need for a non-urgent test, try using verbal cues such as ""Bob, you've never stuck a tube down someone's throat before, right? Want to try it on this patient?""

, This technique can be painful or severely obnoxious, and even many EMT professionals prefer to try the methods above first to maintain good will with the patient. If nothing else works and you are concerned for the sleeper's health, place the knuckles of your hand in the center of the person's chest, along her sternum. Rub up and down until she reacts, or for 30 seconds.Try it on yourself first to discover how much pressure is needed; it doesn't take much to cause discomfort.
Because this can take 30 seconds, it is not advisable in a serious emergency situation.

, When an EMT (emergency medical technician) needs to know the status of a patient immediately, the EMT may use one of the following methods. These cause significant pain and discomfort, and should never be used unless there is immediate need for information, even if the patient is ""clearly"" faking.


Trapezius pinch: Grasp the muscle at the base of the neck with your thumb and forefinger. Twist as you watch and listen for a response.Supraorbital pressure: Locate the bony ridge above an eye, and press against the middle of it with your thumb tip while watching and listening. Always press upward toward the forehead, never down toward the eye."

Choose a bold color.,
Consider wearing a wig.,
Keep it sleek.,
Do something dramatic.",How to Look Like a Pop Star2," You don't need to stick to traditional hair colors. Instead, pick a fun bright color in an eye-popping shade. For example, pop icon Pink frequently sports bright colored hair, and Rhianna favors bright reds and oranges., Wearing a wig can keep your hair from the damaging effects of hair dye,and is especially useful if you want to frequently change the color of your hair, as pop stars often do. Wigs have the added benefit of protecting you from the potentially cancerous effects of some hair dyes.Look for wigs with different styles, such as short sleek bobs or shoulder-length curls. Lady Gaga frequently uses wigs and extensions in order to put her hair up into bows., This is an extremely popular option for male pop stars. Keep the sides of your hair cut short and leave a lot of hair on the top of your head for styling interesting hairdos. Comb over the top, revealing a part on one side of your head. Pink, Justin Bieber, and others frequently use this style.


Use a pomade, wax, or gel to keep the top of your hair in place.

, Don't try for the usual sophisticated updo. Create a unique, somewhat messy hairdo. For example, wear your hair in one giant braid (this works well with extensions), put your hair in two small buns on the top of your head, or shave one side of your head and keep your hair long on the other. Miley Cyrus has frequently sported edgy looks."

Apply basic concealer and foundation.,
Avoid blush.,
Apply a bright lip color.,
Use a simple eye shadow.,
Use eye liner creatively.,
Use several coats of mascara.,
Fill in your eye brows.",How to Look Like a Pop Star3," You'll want to keep the makeup look minimal on most of your face. Simply correct any splotches or pimples and use a light foundation to ensure your facial tone is even. Taylor Swift is known for her fresh faced look.

, Pop stars put most of the emphasis on their eyes and mouths, so bright blush can be distracting. If you do want to use a little blush to contour your cheeks, choose a nude or very light shade and apply it lightly.


You'll also want to skip any bronzer, as this can overemphasize your cheeks.

, You have a couple of color options for your lip makeup. Some pop stars favor a simple bold red lipstick, which can make your lips look larger and give them pop. Or you can choose a bubblegum pink lip gloss, which can give your lips a shiny appeal.

, Pick a metallic or rich color to highlight the crease of your eyelids. Avoid completely covering your eyelids with a very bright color; the emphasis should be on large lashes and creative eyeliner. Lorde usually downplays eye shadow in favor of edgy eyeliner.

, Consider using liquid eyeliner in black or another color to create a bold shape. Be sure to go over your upper and lower lash line and create a shape at the end of your eye. Cat eyes are a pop star style which Katy Perry and Lady Gaga have featured.

, Apply at least two coats of mascara to your eyelashes and brush them out. You may also want to apply fake eyelashes in order to really highlight your eyes.

, Don't worry about really styling your brows into a unique shape. Instead, simply use an eyebrow pencil and fill in your brows so that they are uniform. Stick to a minimal arch and instead keep your brows pretty straight. Beyonce always has thick full eyebrows with a subtle arch."

To form your clique, chat around with some people, and once you find somebody you really like, talk them up a lot until you tend to hang around each other. Continuously do this, but remember, your clique should start with no more than about four girls, including you.

, Take note of the word leader here, because while Regina is the boss that tells everyone what to do, that probably won't slide in real life unless you want people to be afraid of you. However, be the one that's followed. Have your clique come with you everywhere, even just to dump your tray. They're part of you, and just imagine your arms not following you to the trash bin!

Because the focus of Jeffree’s makeup is the eyes, it is important not to use a bold-colour lipstick.,
Experiment.",How to Look and Act Like Jeffree Star," Jeffree's pink hair is what makes his look, and what he is known for. Some of his infamous looks include up-dos, side bangs, and teasing his side bangs. He has a lot of layers in his hair, and he wears a weave. If your hair is not naturally long, a wig, weave, or clip-in extensions are great options.;
, Jeffree Star doesn't have any acne, and he fixes his complexion with a good foundation. If you have acne, try Proactive or Neutrogena. In the meantime, use some concealer that's oil-free and contains Benzoyl Peroxide or Salicylic Acid.

, Your nails don't need to be very long, but they do have to be well-kept. Don't get acrylic nails as once they come off they damage your nails intensely. Your nails should be painted pink.

, That's the most important step. You can't be a good Jeffree Star without this. He loves designer items (you can buy some discounted designer bags at Bluefly.com) and always wears heels. Preferably pink everything.

, Jeffree has a nice body, but you shouldn't completely starve yourself to get it.

,,


Jeffree Star removes his eyebrows so that he can draw them on more dramatically and higher than is ever attainable by plucking. To have Jeffree Star makeup you will need to remove your own eyebrows. The extra space you will create when drawing them on is vital for a Jeffree makeup style.
You will need as clearer skin as is possible if you want a smooth foundation like Jeffree is never seen without.

, Sometimes Jeffree makes it seem natural, but at other times it is completely white.
Once your foundation is complete, you will need to draw on your eyebrows. This is not as easy as it sounds perhaps, but comes easily with practise. To draw on your eyebrows like Jeffree, you may find it useful to use a highlighter pen. Because highlighters are difficult to get in natural hair colours, just use a pink or yellow highlighter and go over this, perfecting the lines with a washable pen a shade lighter than your hair colour. If you have the ‘Jeffree hair’, you can of course use a pink highlighter and go over this with a pink pen to define and perfect the lines. You may even wish to use a kohl pencil to help define your brow, although this will smudge throughout the day if you are not careful.
The important point with the brow shape is that it is thickest at the beginning, where it starts, directly above the inside corner of the eye, and it gradually thins to a very fine line way out, past where your natural brow would go. Aim to peak your brows directly above the outer corner on the eyes.

,


You should apply a harsh, bright pink, powder blush down from level with your ears, into your cheeks. Think of your blush as a line or strip of colour as opposed to a circle of oval of colour. Above your strip of blush you should apply a small amount of sheer, white eyeshadow using a soft brush and very small, light, downward strokes. This will define your facial structure, pulling in your cheeks and accentuating your cheek bones.

, You will need to first apply a vibrant white eyeshadow into the very corners of your eyes (Jeffree uses MAC makeup. MAC have a vast and diverse array of eyeshadow shades which blend well and last. For these reasons, MAC makeup for the eyes is recommended). Once your white is applied, and suitable symmetrical, you will need black eyeshadow...
It is important that your black eyeshadow is BLACK and not a dark grey/carbon shade, because it simply will not have the effect of Jeffree Star’s makeup otherwise. To apply the black eyeshadow you will need a pointed sponge applicator (not a brush due to excessive ‘fall out’). To obtain a sponge applicator, buy a kohl eyeliner pencil with a pointed sponge for blending on the other end. With your black eyeshadow and sponge applicator, line the bottom of your eye very thickly, roughly 5mm to 1 centimeter (0.4 in) down from your lash line. The thickness should vary slightly: thinnest at the inside corner of the eye, and thickest on the outer edge of the eye. Make sure that you continue the thick black around the outside of the eye like wings, though not necessarily as wide out as ‘wings’ might be. It is up to you how you finish the black line at the top. You can make it peak, thus continuing the thick black around the top of eye, though gradually decreasing the thickness until it is non-existent by the time it has reached the top, inner corner.
The next stage is applying the main colour of your Jeffree Star makeup. Jeffree Star almost always wears either a neutral carbon colour or a vibrant blue as his main shade. If you want to look like most readily like Jeffree, it is advisable you go for the blue; because he is renowned for this look. To apply this, you will want a soft eyeshadow brush. Gently apply your eyeshadow into the line you have created on the top of your lid with the black eye shadow. Try to blend this line as well as you can so that the black fades upwards into blue (or whatever other shade you may have chosen). The colour should be applied to mirror the shape of you eyebrows, so that it peaks at the same point (the outer edge/corner of your eye). The colour should finish about 5mm to 1 centimeter (0.4 in) down from your eyebrow.
Now you will need your vibrant white eyeshadow again. Pull this white shade downwards from the bottom edge of your eyebrows, into the shade of colour just applied using a similar brush to the one just previously used. Blend well.
You may wish to now take a flat, slanted brush and draw a fine line of your primary shade down the inside of your nose. It is observable that Jeffree often extends his primary makeup shade further in towards his nose and then down a small way. This creates a kind of shadow which aids in defining your facial structure, setting your eyes further back.
To finish your eyeshadow, you will need to take your vibrant white shade again and fill-in any skin still showing near the inside corner of the eye. Blend this white into the side of your main colour shadow if not already done.
To finish your look it is imperative that you wear fake eyelashes on the top lash-line at least. Do not buy thin eyelashes, even if very long. It is important that you buy very dramatic, thick and long fake eyelashes. When choosing lashes for the top, buy them as thick as possible and make sure that they are longer than the lashes you choose for the bottom. The bottom lashes must be shorter than the top lashes, can be thinner than the top lashes, but must never be thicker or longer than the top lashes. Start by applying your bottom lashes, then do your top lashes. This will make a huge difference to your appearance.
Finally, for the eyes, take a warm, black kohl pencil and draw the colour over your top and bottom eyelid edges. ((DO NOT FORGET THIS STEP!))

, As a general rule, avoid red always. Instead, go for light pink shades;he uses manic panic's mod-a-go-go, or just use a lip-gloss. Lip glosses will not give you a bold colour on their own, but can add some colour and will add a lustrous effect. You may desire to use a light coloured lip pencil and then use a clear gloss over the top.

, Jeffree Star is quite experimental with his makeup, and certainly does not do it the same all the time. The makeup guide, above, explains how to create something similar to his most common styles. When doing your own makeup, you should try to experiment too, but take the points above onboard if you would like to make it a style comparable to Jeffree Star. Things that never change in Jeffree’s makeup include:


The thick black line under the bottom lash line; Unnaturally long and thick fake eyelashes; a pale complexion; and a pink blush (as opposed to plum etc).

Be yourself.",How to Look and Act Like Ariana Grande," Ariana is well known for her ""half up half down look"" and dark long brown hair.


Ariana's signature hairstyle is a voluminous half-up half-down do, with curled, or straight ends. To accomplish this look, slick the top half of your hair back into a sleek ponytail and tie it carefully. Then curl the ends of your hair. This gives you a major boost in the process.
She also wears a high sleek ponytail. You can tease your hair to get volume (if hair is thick no need) or add extensions like her. Wrap your hair around the ponytail then add a bobby pin.
She also likes to wear space buns for fun and it is very easy to do. Instead of just pulling your hair up into one half ponytail split it into two parts and secure with a bobbin. You can either braid them and wrap into two small buns or just leave them like normal buns.
Try a version of her ""half-up, half-down "" look with the bangs pinned behind your ear. Don't worry, you don't even need bangs. Take your hair and part it more to the right of your head. Take a comb, and from the start of your part to the back of your ear. Hold that for now with a bobby pin, so we can focus on the rest. Do the signature half up half down look discussed above. Then when you are done with that, take those bangs you made, and tuck them behind your ear. Make sure there aren't any bumps in your bangs. Secure them with a bobby pin and you're done! If you're not really sure of this method you could go for fake bangs, these are usually sold in beauty stores such as Boots.;
, Take a strip of hair from under your pony tail then, wrap it tightly around your hair tie. All you need to do then is secure it with a bobby pin.

Some hair accessories that Ariana likes to wear are ribbons and bows if you prefer her girly Cat Valentine style.

Ariana loves keeping it basic since she's very in to the 60s, she only uses; concealer/foundation, bronzer, mascara, a thick line of eyeliner, and a nude palette for her eye. Her main shadow color is an orangey pink gold all over her lid.

She likes to finish off her look with a swipe of pale pink lip gloss.






Ariana wore a lot more eyeliner and mascara when she was younger, so you can try that if you want your eyes to appear larger. She claims that since she's Italian, she has dark circles under her eyes, so she always wears concealer.

One must have accessory is a cute simple ring, and her Victoria Secret fashion show phone case. This is often caught on camera when Ariana takes selfies on her phone!

, Ariana's skin is very healthy. She's Italian, so she has a olive skin, which is easier to tan with. If you're not tanned and you really want to be like her, go for some fake tan but be careful that you don't overdo it.


To get beautiful, glowing skin like hers, drink lots of water (one of her personal tips) and eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Ariana's favorite fruits are strawberries and grapes, and she eats them a lot to keep her skin looking healthy.






Wear sunscreen everyday to protect your skin from sun damage. This is especially important if you live some hot and sunny like Ariana (who currently lives in L.A).






If you suffer from acne, make sure you wash your face twice a day (don't wash it any more than that because it can irritate your skin and cause even more acne) and use a spot cream containing benzoyl peroxide or to get rid of any pimples.







, Ariana loves to eat healthy, as it gives her the energy to keep going during long work days and helps her to keep her slim, feminine figure.


Ariana eats organic oatmeal with fruit every morning to get her body ready for the day. She eats a handful of almonds with this for protein, and Ariana has become vegan. You can do this too if you really want to be like Ariana, or go Vegan just like her .






Since she has long work days, she usually eats healthy snacks like Think Thins, Live Raw bars or Pure bars, which are healthier than Special K bars.
Ariana is a vegan but if that is not the road for you, try some lean protein like salmon or chicken along with fruits and vegetables for lunch or dinner. By eating this way, you get to eat every 2-4 hours and have around 5 small meals a day instead of 3 big ones.






Remember that eating healthily is more important than counting calories. In fact, consuming a lot of calories is better than skipping meals, as long as the calories you're consuming are from good, healthy foods.







, Ariana's good friend and choreographer Isaac Calpito has helped her to stay fit and look her best by teaching her how to stay active.


Even if you're not a hardcore athlete, taking walks or slow jogs will help you stay healthy, as long as you do them regularly.






Find a fun way to exercise that you enjoy -- try signing up for a dance class, get some friends together to play volleyball or jump on a trampoline. If you can find something you enjoy, you'll find it much easier to motivate yourself to exercise!







, Ariana's personality is sweet, bubbly, and fun, just like her character on Victorious. She loves to joke around with her friends, and she can act playful and childish while still having a good time.


Ariana has what you'd call a ""happy go lucky"" personality -- she's always in a happy, energetic mood and that's why people are drawn to her and want to be just like her. Try not to be too serious or moody, as that is the opposite of Ariana.






Ariana's real passion is singing -- her idols are Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Download some of their songs and listen to them on repeat! If you have a good voice, have a go at singing them yourself.






Ariana has become rather fond of swearing, but only does it when she is hanging out with friends or on an adult show. She never wants to set a bad example for her younger fans. Though she tends to swear a lot more now, over-swearing will make you seem ignorant and unladylike. Ariana prefers to keep it classy, so unless you are with your friends, try not to swear way too much.






Do some charity work -- Ariana has several causes she's passionate about, including helping disadvantaged kids and fighting against animal cruelty. Get involved with helping others if you really want to be like Ariana.







, Ariana is always on Snapchat, Twitter and Instagram. She loves taking selfies and posting them on these sites to share her fun personality and style with her fans. Get some ideas by looking at her snapchat story (her username is moonlightbae)


To take selfies like Ariana, tilt your head to one side and look up at the camera from this angle - avoid looking at the camera straight on. This pose is really flattering as it highlights your cheekbones and makes your eyes look bigger. Pout your lips and wink. You can also sweep your hair over one shoulder to make your hair look more voluminous.
Use flattering filters and fun stencils. Ariana favors soft, golden filters which give a warm look to her photos or classic black and white for a touch of retro glamour! Add cute heart-shaped stencils and other fun effects to your photos with the AfterLight app (which Ariana loves).
Be playful. Try to have fun with your photos - there's no need to look serious and pouty all the time - Ariana certainly doesn't! Stick out your tongue, take silly pictures with your friends or pets and just have fun with it (Miley's not the only one sticking that wild tongue of hers out)!

, Find caring, genuine friends who love you for you and will be there for you no matter what. Some of Ariana's closest friends are Alexa Luria, Elizabeth Gillies, and Jennette McCurdy.


A tip for making good friends is to talk to people you see a lot. For example, if you're in a dance class, art class, etc. where there's a ton of people, talk to them and a great friendship could blossom. Ariana does the same. She's around her crew members a lot, and now she's best friends with most of them.






Remember that it's okay to have close guy friends too! Ariana has had many close friends in her life of the opposite gender, such as Jones Crow and Isaac Calpito.






Try Become Closer to Your Family Members as well. Ariana and her older brother Frankie have a great brother-sister relationship.







, Ariana's not afraid to show her true personality to her fans, family, and friends. She's not afraid to say what's on her mind or tweet something totally silly sometimes.


Find your own personal style and stick to it. It's okay to want to follow in Ariana's footsteps and look up to her, but remember not to act exactly like her. Let your true self shine as well!

Listen to Michael Jackson's music.,
Add your own flourishes.,
Get into it.,
Practice regularly.,
Hire a vocal coach.,

Take care of your voice.,
Learn to sing tenor.,
Practice singing soprano.,
Try to sing falsetto.",How to Sing Like Michael Jackson," From his early Jackson 5 recordings to his industry-transforming later work, Michael Jackson's musical art is a veritable treasure trove of vocal techniques, singing styles and performing flair. Familiarize yourself with this material—think of it as homework. Try to pick out outstanding moments that make Jackson's music so memorable, and think about how you can implement these touches in your own style.


With countless albums spanning over forty years, live recordings, and concert video footage, MJ has left plenty of material to take cues and inspiration from.;
, After you've gained proficiency singing like MJ, start including some of your own unique traits. The King of Pop's musical styling remains so influential precisely because of his tendency to improvise distinctive embellishments in his songs. Don't just settle for being like Mike. Get comfortable in his style and make it your own.


Most of Michael Jackson's trademark touches, such as his peculiar pronunciation of ""come on"" as ""shamone"" and exclamations like ""hee-hee!,"" were improvisations made while recording. Get into the spirit of Jackson's music when singing by loosening up and adding your own embellishments, or even improvise new lyrics and rhythms for a brand new take on a classic song.

, Really put all of yourself into your singing! That intensity of feeling will show. Impressive singing is not always about hitting the notes, but wringing life out of them. Michael Jackson's own style was more noteworthy for its soulfulness than for its classical proficiency. Give it all you've got. Even get up and dance, if the music moves you. If you want to become a great performer, you've got to start with the man in the mirror.It may not always seem like it, but singing can be a physically stressful activity after a while. Don't get so into it that you damage your voice.
Remember to have fun! Music should be about being moved and spreading that feeling, so relax and enjoy yourself.

, Devote some time every day to practice singing along to Michael Jackson's music and hone your technique. You don't have to get too formal with it—sing in the car, in the shower or while watching TV and just have fun with it. Singing is like any other skill, so the more you practice the better you'll get.Unlike other activities, practicing singing is something you can do every day, even while you're doing other things!
Learn to sing MJ's songs the way he sang them, then branch out and make use of your own unique vocal range and rhythm. Start with songs like ""Will You Be There"" for more traditional singing style, then move on to more difficult songs like ""Dirty Diana"" or ""Beat It.""

, If you're serious about becoming a better singer, consider hiring a vocal coach. These are professional music teachers who specialize in analyzing voices and devising methods for vocal improvement. A good vocal coach means a good ear to give you feedback about your technique and help take your singing to the next level.This option can be a great benefit to your voice but comes with considerable expense. You should probably only hire a vocal coach if you're a dedicated singer seeking to refine your craft and have the necessary funds.
It is not a requirement to work with a vocal coach in order to become a talented singer. Many of today's most popular artists are self-trained. If you learn the right methods and practice hard, your singing will improve.

, In addition to simply singing for practice, look up some voice warm-ups and exercises you can incorporate into your daily routine to improve your voice quality and efficiency. Voice exercises often consist of playful range modulation sequences and quick nonsensical phrases designed to fine-tune enunciation, projection and tonal accuracy. Doing voice exercises systematically is the equivalent of an archer practicing drawing a bowstring, or a basketball player drilling free throws.An example of a common voice exercise used by choir singers during their warm-up is to repeat a sententious line, often packed full of assonance and alliteration, like ""mommy made me mash my M&Ms,"" singing your way up and down the scale and hitting a higher octave on each recitation.
Since Michael Jackson's music was sung in a wide variety of ranges, you should also structure your voice exercises to be able to move through different ranges.
Songs like ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"" will make great voice exercises in themselves because of their rapid changes in rhythm and tone.

, Your voice is like a car's engine. It requires rigorous care and maintenance to be able to perform at top capacity. Be careful about singing out of your natural range and avoid dehydration, loud shouting or anything else that might put unnecessary strain on your voice. Give yourself a break from singing once a week or so to allow your vocal cords to fully recover.Be sure to drink plenty of water before singing for long periods. The moisture will help make your voice supple and protect the tissue in and around your vocal cords from damage.
If your throat becomes strained or sore from singing, sip warm tea, gargle mild salt water or use cough drops to sooth the discomfort and use your voice as little as possible to give it a chance to heal.

, Study the tenor voice and work on fitting your voice to the appropriate range. Tenor is the highest male voice in classical singing and fell within Jackson's natural range once he got older. Tenor can be tough to hit and maintain, even for girls, so it will require a sharp ear and plenty of training before you can add it to your vocal repertoire.Listen to recordings of famous tenor singers to get an idea of what a strong natural tenor voice sounds like.
One good way to practice singing in the tenor voice is by using a keyboard or piano and singing notes from Upper 'C' down to Lower 'C.'
By the time Jackson matured, his natural range had dropped to high tenor. This can be heard in his most famous songs, including ""Thriller"" and ""Man in the Mirror.""

, Study the soprano voice and begin practicing basic notes. Soprano is the highest vocal pitch and one of the most technically difficult to sing. Jackson learned to sing in the higher registers as a boy in the Jackson 5 and expanded his range as he got older.Normal soprano range extends from Middle 'C' to High 'A,' making it the highest vocal range. As such, soprano is ordinarily sung by females; men who can sing in soprano voice boast especially impressive range.
Don't worry if you have trouble settling into the soprano voice. It might take some time to train your voice to properly hit a higher register, or it might simply be out of your natural range. This is okay. Expanding your range is a good focus in voice training, but you should know your limits and always stick within a comfortable natural range.
Jackson most famously sung in a soprano voice as a child in Jackson 5 songs like ""I Want You Back"" and ""I'll Be There.""

, Add some falsetto to your singing style. Falsetto is not so much a proper voice as a technique that allows the singer to hit much higher notes than they otherwise could in their natural voice. It was a favorite technique of MJ's: he was even known to sing entire songs in falsetto. Practice working your way into the falsetto ""voice"" by changing your point of projection upwards from the diaphragm to the top of the throat and nose.If you're unsure of how to project in a falsetto voice, try talking in a high-pitched cartoon character voice or ""wooing"" like you would a concert or sporting event. The same muscle groups used to generate these noises come into play when singing falsetto. The sound should feel like it's coming out from the center of your head, not from your lower throat or diaphragm.
Falsetto was a technique very commonly utilized by Michael Jackson. Songs like ""Billie Jean"" and ""Smooth Criminal"" all feature prolonged sections of falsetto vocalization.

Remember!",How to Look and Act like Lady Gaga," Go on to iTunes (optional) and find some Wild Tiger songs. Eg: The Alligator, Speechless, Dance in the Dark, Fashion... etc. and listen to the phrases she repeats, like ""cherry cherry boom boom"" and pick up her language. Also, it would be helpful to try to find some videos of her being interviewed. Study the way she walks, talks, poses, her body movements, and her personality (if she smiles or not, what she laughs at, you know, just how she basically acts).;
, After you have seen the way she does all that stuff, you should take the time to study what she wears. Rip all your clothes and never wear anything that matches. Lady Gaga wears some really cool (and sometimes outrageous) clothes. She ALWAYS dresses like this. She's always Gaga, and if you want to be like her, you should do.


Make clothes yourself! That's part of why Gaga is so awesome. Her clothes are custom made by world famous designers. Look at the Haus of Gaga for ideas.

, You will need some one piece bikinis like in ""Eh, Eh."" So, a great Gaga-inspired outfit for a hot day would be a bikini and some retro, cool, and unique sunglasses (they don't have to be huge, Gaga's little circular ones are cute). You will also need some cute accessories. Choose accessories that highlight who you are, not how rich you are. In other words, you don't have to go grab the priciest necklace and run for it. Some more things you might want are hair extensions. If you've seen her music video for ""Poker Face"", you probably know that she sports a bow made out of hair. If you like that look, go on youtube. There are many nice videos that show you how to make a mock bow with hair extensions. So, if you haven't yet mastered the Gaga look, or you aren't exactly sure what you should use to achieve it, just be yourself, and be unique! Also, you don't have to copy everything she does. I'm sure she doesn't have a plan every day what she wants to wear, and I'm sure she doesn't just walk into a store and everything there is perfect. I bet she just rummages through her closet to find an outfit, and has to look through every store in the mall, just like us.

, Make up some unique and one-of-a-kind words/phrases. For example, here are some words: Cupcake, Heartless, Apple pie apple pie, GAGA! Crazy daisy, Ooh La La, and Paper Gangsta, are also good examples. You can also refer to people you like as ""little monsters"" as GaGa to her fans.

, You can even use these if you want.

, When people are taking pictures of you pose by putting your hands on your hips and slightly turn your elbows to the camera. Slightly lift one foot off the ground and gently place it on the other one. This is only one of her many poses. Look up photos of her posing to see more of her cute poses. You can even create your own poses!

, Okay, so your hair. like Lady Gaga, you may dye your hair blonde or bleach it. Lady Gaga has had long and short hair. Currently, it's very short. She wears wigs most of the time. She is also famous for her sharp, perfect, and long bangs. If you want, make short hair curly like GaGa does in her music videos for ""Bad Romance"" and ""Love Game"". If you just can't decide, want more than one style, or don't want to dye your hair, it helps to have several wigs handy!


You could also buy some crazy hats and accessories to put in your hair. And you should always remember to have fun with your hair! It doesn't even have to be blonde if you don't want it to be! Like stated before, just be your unique self!

, Makeup is important. You can really do a lot with makeup because Lady GaGa has so many different ways of using it. If you want makeup like she has in one of her videos, again search it up on youtube! MichellePhan on Youtube has many wonderful Lady Gaga makeup tutorials.

, While this is not necessary, it will add to your Lady Gaga persona. If you do sing, remember to protect your claim to fame—your voice! Drink lots of water and eat well. Don't sing when you are tired or have a dry throat.

, No matter were you go, people may think you are a poser and may call you one (posers are wannabes that try to copy looks, but usually fail at doing so). Don't let them put you down! They are probably just jealous that you have such great taste. And I will tell you this now, people are gonna stare at you. Again, don't let them put you down. If people do stare at you smile and wave, don't put your head down and hide! Confidence is the key. If they say, ""You look stupid!"" just say something like, ""Aw, how sweet! I love your clothes too!"" Or say one of your quotations, smile, and walk away!

Study both the movie and the book Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire so you will know what Beauxbatons is and know a little about the school.,
Learn French.,
Visit a costume site or search on Ebay for a Beauxbatons costume.,
Wear your hair in a ponytail and on formal occasions just make it look gorgeous.

,
Make your bedroom more elegant and ""Beauxbatons"" like, by printing out the school logo and stick it in your bedroom and you can try to make a part of your room like a four-poster bed.Get a desk where you can do your French homework and write down new spells you learnt.,
Be calm and serene.,
Make any guests or people that come to your school welcome.,
Look beautiful.All Beauxbatons students are beautiful and classy.,
Perfume.Beauxbaton girls obviously smell great to the opposite gender.",How to Be Like a Beauxbatons Student," For example, you will notice the Beauxbatons girls wear fluttery blue robes and hats. They walk gracefully and are always polite. The Beauxbatons students act like they are better than everybody else-and they are! They are completely confident with everything they say and do. Incorporate these traits into your everyday life, and you will slowly become more Beauxbatons.;
, Every student in that school speaks French and most students also know English.If you can't, just throw in little french phrases into your speech, like ""Bonjour"", ""Merci"" and ""Salut!"" If you don't learn french in school, you could try learning french out of a book or online. You could also google Fleur Delacour quotes and copy her graceful, intelligent way of talking.

, If you can't, wear light blue as often as you can, and you could try a trilby.

,, Keep it tidy.

, Try not to be boring though! Never get angry or frustrated, but if you do, don't show it! The Beauxbatons girls are always calm and quiet. Don't bore people with constant spouts of knowledge, and don't seem overly confident.

, As threatening as they might look, the Beauxbatons girls are actually very friendly and caring. Look after a friend in need or take the new girl under your wing. Get good grades and try your best at everything.

, Wear just enough make up to look stunning, but not too much. The Beauxbatons girls are natural and never wear too much make up. Try some light foundation-mineral powder works best, wear lots of mascara (try only the top lashes), a hint of blush, and clear or sparkly lip gloss. Always look your best, no matter where you are going. Remain polished and beautiful at all times

, Wear a feminine, light scent. For example, Bath and Body Works has a line called Paris Amour (translated into Love Paris) that is supposed to smell like France.

Set up a good studying area.,
Use different books for every subject so you do not get confused.,
Make planners.,
Take notes in everything.,
Ask yourself questions on what you are reading.,
If you do not like studying, give yourself goals or rewards for doing study.,
If you really don't like the subjects, turn Science to Potions or maybe Maths to Arithmancy.

,
Have fun whilst studying.,
Listen to some music.,
Study with others.,
Study a lot of the time but don't forget to sleep!,
Study for weeks in advance.",How to Study Like Hermione Granger," A large desk and maybe a bookshelf is required. Have a decent quill and a lot of ink (for Muggles, don't let your pens run out––buy extra). Make sure you have all the materials (e.g. pens, pencils, paper, highlighters) that you may require to complete your study ready and near by so that you can avoid interruptions during your study time.;
, If you want to get super organised, you can colour code your books. This can be done by having a certain colour for each of your classes/subjects, and purchasing a folder and book in that classes' specific colour. (e.g. Red for maths, yellow for English, blue for Science).

, Hermione makes planners. Homework planners may seem nerdy, but you're trying to be Hermione Granger, the class Know-it-all. So if you don't want to do this step, it's completely your choice. But remember, the real Hermione wouldn't have taken offense to anything. (Apart from the first time she was called a Mud-Blood but we can live with that because not everyone is made of solid rock.)


To make a homework planner, grab a suitable lined book. Use a non-removable stickiness charm, and decorate the inside. Also, put a spell on it so it shouts out quotes at you whenever you open it (that's what Hermione did for Ron and Harry.) But make sure you can use these spells properly before attempting; if you haven't a clue as a Muggle, you will have to use ink or coloured pen for the quotes and glue in some cool decorations that make it seem like a ""charmed"" book.

, This means that when it does come time to study, you have all the information you need in front of you.


Use notation forms that are useful for you; don't copy other forms unless you actually find them useful. It is often best to develop your own highlighting methods, your own shorthand, and your own summarizing techniques.

, Doing this will indicate whether or not you understood what you have read.


Read the passage or paragraphs.
Brainstorm a few questions based on what you read.
Read the passage or paragraph once more and answer the questions.

, For example: ""After doing 30 minutes of maths study, I am allowed to have a small square of chocolate."" It is also good to include physical movement breaks as a reward; for example, after 1-hour study, allow yourself a five-minute walk or stretch before coming back to the books.

,, While this may be hard a lot of the time, try to inject enjoyment into some of the studying. If something really interests you, learn more about it in your own way and become more knowledgeable in it so that you can wow the teacher.

, Hermione doesn't do this, but it can help you to study if you're so inclined. You could listen to all sorts of genres, like Blues, Jazz, R&B, Pop Rock, etc... Whatever floats your boat. However usually music with no lyrics works the best so that you are not getting distracted by what is being sung in the song.

, Hermione often studied in the Gryffindor common room with the other Gryffindors. The library is another place where you are communally linked in silence; it's quite a nice thing to not be alone when studying; you can share the agony around.


To make studying more interesting, maybe try doing it with a friend but a friend with whom you won't get distracted.
Study groups may help also.

, Sleep will not only make you look good and feel refreshed but will also boost your concentration level.

, If you know you have a test at the end of the year, then ask the teacher what you need to do to get the highest grade (or level for you Muggles) and then study all of the time until you are certain this is correct. Do this for all of your lessons.

Dress the part.,
Get a wand.,

Take your wand with you everywhere.,
Use a quill and ink instead of a pencil or pen.,
Get your friends in on the act.,
Choose an allegiance of some sort.,
Have a familiar.,
Write down your key wizarding information gleaned from sneaking about humanity.,
Let out wizard comments.,
Act knowledgeable.,
Get some empty notebooks.",How to Pretend to Be a Wizard Like Harry Potter at School," You don't have to wear pointy hats or dress like you are attending prom, but things like T-shirts and jeans have to go. Wearing a collared shirt and nice pants (if you are a boy), or a dress (if you are a girl) is much more convincing. Darker colors are better for your wizard apparel, but they are not necessary.;
, Just get a straight stick, about 14 inches (35.6 cm) long, and soak it in the tub, to remove bark. Then, if you want, spray paint it black, white, grey, or brown. If you can't, just color it with markers and make it look realistic.

, Have days where you don't say much, and if your friends want to talk to you say you have somewhere to be.

, Put it in your backpack, or if you have deep pockets, you can put it there. Try to have it peeking out some, but not to the point where it is very obvious or could fall out. If someone asks you what it is, make up a somewhat convincing lie and tuck it out of sight.

, This will definitely convince your friends and classmates. Some hobby shops sell feathers that you could get for a cheap price, and then all you need is ink. You don't ever see Harry writing with a pen in class, now do you?

, For your friends, pick the characters they like best as wizards––these don't need to be Harry Potter wizards.

, Pick a house, club, group or clan that your wizard comes from. Make crests and place these on clothing, bags and books.

, Have a pet cat, rat or dog at home. Do not bring the pet to school. Just say things like, ""is really helpful. I love him/her."" If they ask who is, say ""Oh, nobody, just my pet .""

, Try to get an extra blank notebook, and put all your info inside. Keep it safe.

, At real school, drop hints, like, ""I can't wait until tonight, that's when I go to..."", then stop quickly. Act as if your wizarding school happens at night, and under age kids are allowed to appreciate to it, no matter their location. You could also say, ""I miss ."" If anyone asks who that is, just say nobody.

, Go to the library as often as you can, and frequently be seen with mythical and magical books. Do your best to get good grades, but make it seem easy. When you are around friends, use large words and spout facts, as long as they are on topic.

, Composition works well. Label one, ""Spells"", and one ""Potions"", and the last one, ""Homework"". Look up Harry Potter spells on Google, and write one on each page, followed with definitions. In the potion one, do the same. For homework, look through the classes on Wikipedia. Write the ones you like at the front page, and every time you ""do homework"", put the name at the top.


Carry an old book around with you a lot as your chief spell book. If you can, get a book with Latin or another foreign language on it. You don't need to go over board and title it ""SPELL BOOK"" because then it would seem fake. Bring it everywhere, and don't let anyone see it. Act concerned if someone asks what it is. If you want, you can leave it lying around one day so that people will pick it up.

First thing is to think of a name.,
Second, Think of what she looks like.,
Now try to make her personality.,
Another important step is to think of her family.,
Now think of the blood.,
What house are they in?,
Choose their friends or make some up!,
Now go and use that character!",How to Make Your Own Harry Potter Character (for Girls)," It's best to make your name fit the HP universe, so use normal, but not too common, names. Some ideas are: Blair, Isabelle, Sarah, Jacqueline, Eleanor, Carol, Zoe, Scarlet, or Lorna. If you are a ""pureblood"", then use the name of a constellation or star, such as Lyra, Aquarius, Phoebe, Mira, Juliet, Calypso, or even Phoenix! One thing to not do, is give your character a name that is overly long or have a clichéd meaning (such as Lillian Darkness Rose Raven), that is both a Mary Sue trait and unnecessary. There are limitless possibilities, so be creative but follow canon laws!;
, Maybe she has dark brown hair? Bright ginger? Or black? Maybe even an uncommon colour such as auburn or platinum blonde? Also think about eye colour, skin tone etc. This part is both fun and hard, as you have to find an appearance that is both unique and fits the HP universe. Don't give your character unnatural hair colours unless they dyed it! br>
, Maybe she is bitter and arrogant on the outside, but is actually unsure of herself? Or humorous and outgoing? Or maybe shy and timid? There are loads of personality traits that you can choose, just try to be original and make sure that it makes sense. Give her some flaws as well as strengths, they make a character more believable and it is interesting for the readers to watch them overcome those flaws. Some examples of flaws are: Unconfident, stubborn, reckless, or antisocial. Some strengths are: Cunning, patient, loyal, or kind.

, Something to remember is to not make her related to a canon character, because that will be illogical and a sign of unoriginality. Maybe she has parents who are rich but is too busy at work to care about her? Maybe a normal family with annoying siblings? Maybe she have a twin sister who is the polar opposite?

, Maybe your characters, halfblood, Muggle-born, or pureblood. This part is optional, you don't have to go into detail but their blood might affect the way other students treat her!

, Are they in the bold and loyal Gryffindors, the cunning and ambitious Slytherins, the wise and confident Ravenclaws, or the kind and modest Hufflepuffs? Your choice entirely. But remember, it has to match their personality! A useful way to determine their house is to find a good sorting hat quiz, then choose the answers as your character would!

, Maybe your character is best friends with Luna and Cho? Maybe she hangs out with Crabbe and Goyle? Or even the Patil twins? Make sure the friend you choose is someone who can get along with her, or perhaps she is a loner in the first place? Even better, make up other original characters to be her friends! Don't make her friends with the trio or Draco Malfoy, that's too overused. Don't make her friends with almost everyone, give her some rivals and you would have some interesting conflict!

, What good is a character for, if you can't show it to anyone? Go out and roleplay on sites like pottermore.com or write a fanfiction on writing sites, especially Fanfiction. net and Deviantart. Or google after Harry Potter themed writing sites.

Copy her hair.,
Keep your skin healthy.,
Do your makeup like Haley.,
Keep good hygiene.,
Emulate her style.,
Copy her personality.",How to Look Like Haley Dunphy from Modern Family," Throughout the show, Haley has had different hairstyles, but it always looks perfect. Every morning, or every other morning, depending on your hair type, start by washing your hair with a good brand such as Herbal Essences, Pantene, or Tresemme. Then, use a heat protecting product and blow dry. There are some heat protectants out there that are made specially for blow-drying. If you want, you can use more before you start styling it with heat.


For seasons 1 and 2, Haley almost always curls the ends of her hair, so wrap larger sections of hair around the curling wand for effortless looking curls. To save time, you can wash your hair before bed and put it into two buns on the sides of your head, or one on top of your head. When you take it out in the morning, it will already have soft curls.
In the current season, her hair is shoulder length. It is often curly, but sometimes straight. To achieve this, wash your hair and blow dry by scrunching with mousse. To save time, wash at night and put your hair in two french braids. For the straight look, straighten your hair, but not so it is pin straight.
Sometimes, she puts her bangs up by braiding them and pinning them back, or just twisting them. Once a week, use a hair mask. You can buy one, or you can make your own using avocado, olive oil, and honey mashed together.;
, Every morning, splash your face with warm water to open up your pores. Then, use a mild face wash to clean you face. Use a toner after this. Moisturize your face with something nice from brands like Clean & Clear, Neutrogena, or Proactive. Do this at night, too. Always remember to take your makeup off. Get an exfoliating scrub, and use it as often as the directions on the container tell you to. If you don't know how often to use it, do it twice a week. Also, use an acne medication if you have acne.

, Start by applying a BB cream. Then, put concealer under your eyes and on any blemishes. Blend it in using a brush or your finger. Finish your skin off by applying powder with a big, fluffy brush.


Apply a primer to your eyelids. A good one to use would be Urban Decay primer potion, but you can use any kind. Put a medium-brown shade of eye shadow above your eyelid in the crease and on the outer corner of you eye. Then, put white eye shadow on your brow bones and on the inner corners of your eyes. Put a shimmery gold shadow on the center of your eyelid. Haley also wears brown eyeliner on her outer corner and upper lashline. Don't forget brown/black mascara. Use white on your waterline for that big eye effect.
She has pale/nude lips so exfoliate and apply a good lip balm. Then use a nude lip gloss or lipstick.
Paint your nails! You can use dark colors like black, purple, or dark red.
Haley tends to have quite natural makeup, although she's been seen wearing a smoky eye look. Keep your makeup fresh, natural and flawless.

, You should definitely have good hygiene, whether you want to be like Haley or not. So, shower at least once a day, and wash your hair every day if you have thin or fine hair, or every other day if your hair is thick. Exfoliate your skin at least once a week. Moisturize your skin everyday right after you shower.

, Haley is always wearing a cardigan, so make that your signature piece! Wear lots of darker colors, like red, brown, dark blue, and purple. For clothes like hers, look for pieces at Forever 21, Aeropostale, American Eagle, Pacsun, and Wet Seal. Also, if you are younger, you can try wearing Uggs.

, Haley loves clothes, boys, and her friends. So, go shopping whenever you have the chance, and hang out with your friends. Also, get a boyfriend. You don't have to have one to be like Haley, but if a cute boy likes you, don't turn him down!

Wear random clothing but try to wear something of someone whose style is punk hardcore or gothic.",How to Look Like Criss Angel,";
,, All black. If you're into the hardcore gothic style, this one is for you.
His Season One style was shoulder length, scraggly/flippy hair, loose fitting military clothes, workout clothes, tight T-shirts, and combat boots. If you like the camouflage/relaxed style, this is a good one for you.
His Season Two style was much more rock 'n roll, as most of what he wore was Affliction brand. Criss's hair was slightly shorter, and he wore lots of jeans and neutral colored shirts with zip-up hoodies. Leather jackets used on party occasions. For the edgy look, try this one.
His season Three style is shorter hair, colored with red and blond. Clothing-wise, still much like Season Two, give or take a few shirts. More leather jackets! Criss came back with lots of sparkly jewelry, which really makes you look high class. If you're going for the modern rock fan, this one is yours.

How she acts is what makes most people like her. She is kind to everyone and tries to find the good in people. While at times it is easier to be slightly rude to others, it invokes a very good response towards you from others, so many would favor this. It's a bit hard at first, but later it becomes natural to you.;
, She is temporary leader of the Circle at the beginning of the books and is very passionate about being a leader. She makes the others see what needs to be done without much force (depending on who it is..) but is always very serious about the Circle. Being a leader can be managed with some hard work, but being a serious leader who is still kind and always sympathetic is difficult. Sometimes you may just have to dwindle the effect a bit so you don't overwork it.

, In the beginning after rescuing Cassie from Faye, Deborah and Suzan, she kind of adopts Cassie as her little sister. She is very caring and always willing to help others. She works hard at being the best person she can be, but she said herself that she doesn't know why people are so nice to her. It is always very rewarding to have a good caring attitude, at times it's hard to keep up, but that's where being strong willed comes in. People will look up to you for your demeanor.

, She's extremely modest, and if discussing Adam, her long time boyfriend, easily embarrassed. While you don't need to take the modesty too far and completely push people away from the truth, it's good to be modest. It gives off a selfless image.

, She is often referred to as the Princess of Purity by Faye. She is very good in all ways, and she is pure in every way. She doesn't take offense to things easily. This means that you'd have to have an even temper for the most part, or learn to control your temper. It's a good life skill.

, She is very forgiving towards everyone and is always willing to give a second chance to people. Being forgiving would lead to being able to put things in the past, forgive and forget kind of thing. It can be useful but also harmful at the same time-don't take it too far to where you regret it.

, You could write centrally about yourself, like other Lisbon sisters. You could also talk of everyone as a whole like Cecilia. Journaling is one of the ways Cecilia keeps her rich inner world.

, You don't have to wear your emotions on your sleeve. One of the reasons why the boys followed them so closely is because they were secretive and interesting. They shared their secrets with one another and they didn't go after boys. Boys went after them.

Seth has dyed, longish, black hair.,
He also has a lip ring, multiple eyebrow piercings, a belly ring and a nipple piercing (or two!).",How to Be Like Seth Morgan from the Wicked Lovely Series (for Boys)," Seth spends large amounts of time meditating and indulging in his passion with art to help himself have a calm and peaceful personality.;
, Seth is always mindful of his emotions and reactions to things and attempts to be a calm and stable as possible. Never act on extreme emotions, such as anger or jealousy, take some time to think about things and the consequences of all your actions.

, Some of the things that Seth is interested in include all different genres of music, reading as many books as possible, spending time chilling with friends, and of course, his art, including painting, sculpting, drawing etc. Find some things that make you happy and devote your free time to doing and finding out as much as you can about them.

, Don't be rude, or show off. Always respect girls and develop compassion for others, even if they are not your favorite people in the world. Deeply care for your friends, family and environment. Also, Seth drinks tea out of teacups :)

, Seth is very intelligent and also very street smart. He reads a lot, studies, researches topics that interest him and also has a very well developed sense of intuition.

, Don't feel you ever have to prove yourself to anyone. The people who love you will love you as you really are. Don't change just for a passing comment someone made and don't get bummed out if people are negative towards you, just ignore them.

, Treat you parents, teachers, enemies, friends, true love, pets, etc with the same level of respect.

, Respect your body and mind. This doesn't mean be completely straight edge (though you can if you want too), but just be mindful of not trashing yourself or your environment.

, Decorate your room in a way that is pleasing to you.

, Have lots of friends and go out with them, invite them over etc. But try not to get into trouble or do stupid things.

(Not saying that emos and goths aren't, but we're talking about the negative stereotype here.)

, You don't have to dye your hair if you don't want but have a hair style that suits you.

, You don't have to get piercings if you don't want but it helps to reinforce Seth's sweet-badass-sexy-individual image he has going. Ditto tattoos.

Pretend to have telekinetic powers.",How to Act Like Carrie White," Carrie is described as having long, mousy hair in the novel, but she's been played by many actors with varying hair colors - the 1976 movie portrayed Sissy Spacek with a slightly reddish tint to her hair; the 2002 variant involved a dark-haired actress, Angela Bettis; the 2013 reboot starred Chloë Grace Moretz, a blonde; and the musicals portrayed her with many different hair colors. Regardless, Carrie's hair is long, usually reaching down to her shoulders at the minimum, and she often uses it as a ""curtain"" to hide her face.
, While this may not seem like much of a Carrie thing, it's mentioned in the novel that her clothing, picked out by her mother, is extremely unflattering so that she doesn't attract the attention of boys, as her mother considers this to be sinful. You don't have to take this to the extremes that Carrie's mother did, but try deliberately wearing clothing that doesn't quite suit your body type to emulate how Carrie dresses.

Try to avoid wearing fashionable clothes and just getting them too big or too small. Carrie's clothing is stated specifically to not be considered fashionable, and in all screen or stage adaptations of the novel, her clothing is never anything close to fashionable regardless of the time period it's produced in. It's even stated in the book that Carrie wishes she could wear what the other girls wear.
Optionally, you can also wear a cross necklace. In the 2013 remake of the movie, Chloë Moretz is seen wearing a silver cross necklace. You don't have to wear one, though; the original novel is set in the 1970's, before wearing cross jewelry was common.

, Carrie is an outcast, regardless of whether you read the book or just watch one of the movies or musicals, and is subjected to constant bullying from her peers - the ""shower scene"" is a good example, as when Carrie gets her first period, the other girls pelt her with pads and tampons rather than helping her, and don't stop until the teacher comes in and stops them. In the 2013 movie, this is even recorded by Chris, posted online, and then replayed at the prom after the blood is dropped on Carrie! Act shy and like you're scared of what others say about you or do to you.

Carrie is shown to have low self-esteem in the 2013 movie, as she starts crying after Tommy asks her to the prom and asks why someone like him would be interested in her. This isn't elaborated on much further, but it shows: all that bullying has taken a toll on her.

, Carrie was shown to be very talented at sewing; she made her own prom dress, as well as several of her other dresses, and her mom was a professional seamstress. You don't have to be that good at it, but learn how to sew something simple., Carrie is a devout Christian, although she does stray from her mother's idea of Christianity due to how her mother considers everything sinful. It's even stated in the book that Carrie isn't allowed to sleep with a pillow because her mother says pillows are sinful, and she wasn't taught about puberty for that reason, too! You don't have to become Christian or change your religion to be like Carrie, but if you're already Christian, show it off a little more., In the novel and a few of the movies, Carrie was shown to be fiercely protective towards those who were kind to her, such as Mrs. Desjardin, Sue (after realizing she wasn't in on the prank), and Tommy. However, those who bullied her relentlessly were no match for her telekinetic powers, and Carrie killed quite a lot of people (such as Chris and her gang of friends), destroying the entire town of Chamberlain in her rampage. Obviously, don't kill people or cause anyone physical harm, but if someone is rude to you, show that you're mad., Despite how abusive and overly protective Carrie's mother was, Carrie loved her like nothing else, and deeply regretted having to kill her, even though it was in her own self-defense; in the movies, she even let her house collapse on her after she killed her mother. You don't have to love your family that unconditionally - if your family is dysfunctional and abusive, it's probably better not to - but show a loving respect for your parents., Clench your fists whenever you get too angry or sad. Look like you're holding back - gritting your teeth, trembling, and ""clenching"" the muscles in your face can make you seem like you're on the verge of letting a telekinetic wave loose."

Research folklore.",How to Be Like Piper McLean from Heroes of Olympus," Don't copy Piper exactly, or you will look like a poser. As long as you like the way your hair looks, it doesn't matter. Piper doesn't care about her looks (which is ironic, given the fact that she is a child of Aphrodite) and is happy looking scruffy and disheveled, as long as she feels good. If you want to look like Piper, then go for a choppy hair cut, and little side braids, which don't take a lot of maintenance. But if you truly want to act like Piper, then as long as you like your hair, anything goes.;
, Piper is naturally good looking, and she doesn't spend hours fussing over make-up and clothes. Just dress in whatever you feel comfortable wearing. Piper tends to wear ripped jeans, converse, loose t-shirts and plaid shirts. She dresses for comfort, and not to please anyone but herself. Frankly, getting a lot of attention, for Piper, is very embarrassing, so don't try to draw attention to your clothing.

, Wash your face daily, apply toothpaste to spots overnight to help them heal, use acne creams if you need to, and just generally look after your skin. Piper is naturally pretty, and does not need make up to feel beautiful, so neither should you.

, Piper is a pretty tough cookie. No matter what you face, try to appear cool and collected. Try to stay calm in tricky situations. Piper is not afraid to stand up against bullies or speak her mind. She never needs to resort to petty name calling or violence, because she can stand up for herself, even against nasty people (like Drew, from the Aphrodite Cabin). If you find keeping your cool difficult, make sure you breathe through your nose, to help calm yourself down and if you need to, have a little list of clever comebacks in the back of your mind if you need to use them (but only as a last resort).

, Piper might be able to get whatever she wants using her charms speak, but that doesn't stop her from being a kind person. She is kind to all the kids at Camp Half-Blood, even the ones who were mean to her at first. She is even nice to that horrible bully, Drew. (Remember, people like Drew can't stand it when you're nice to them. They hate it. If somebody starts acting like Drew, and tries to be mean to you, just smile sweetly, and be so sickeningly nice to them that they can't stand it. It drives them crazy!) Charms speak doesn't really exist, but you CAN go places by being nice to people. Remember, please and thank you will go a long way!

, Piper hates being the center of attention. Try not to be loud, obnoxious, or cause a scene.

, You don't have to be one of those boy-crazy teenage girls who go goo-goo eyed over some hot boy-band, or read soppy romance books that make you want to puke, but care about love. Love is powerful, more powerful than you know, and try to be the girl that your friends go to for dating advice, even if you haven't dated many/any people at all! Never try to mess up people's relationships on purpose, and when you see a couple, be happy for them. Don't obsess over love, but don't be embarrassed to have a crush or be in love. It happens. It's okay.

, Piper is a vegetarian, but of course, you don't have to become one if you don't want to. Remember, the best way to be like Piper is to just be yourself, and not care about what other people think, rather than copy her exactly.

, Piper loves Cherokee mythology. It is a good idea to look up myths and legends in your free time, especially ones connected to your family heritage (e.g. If you're Irish, look up Celtic lore).

Decide between costume or style.,
Wear black.Make this the dominant color of every piece of clothing.,
Choose the right material.,
Keep your tops short-sleeved.,
Wear boots.,
Accessorize.",How to Look Like a Shadowhunter1," Are you only planning to dress like a Shadowhunter for Halloween, Comic Con, or some other one-time deal? Or do you wish to adopt their aesthetic for your own day-to-day wear? Depending on which route you take, think about how authentic you wish to be, since leather and tattoos are signature styles for Shadowhunters, which can be quite expensive and, in the latter case, either permanent or really time-consuming if you reapply temporary tattoos on a daily basis.;
, Feel free to accent your outfits with complementary colors that also match your hair and skin tone, but limit those colors to accents, as opposed to making them your clothes’ primary color. As a rule, though, default to solid black, especially if you are going out on the hunt. Also, stick to solids without any prints, logos, or designs (unless your fashion is inspired more by Clary).


If you plan on dressing the part on a day-to-day basis, feel free to vary the “all-black” look with more color. But if this is a one-time deal, like for a Halloween party, stick to all-black to make your costume easy to identify.

, Since Shadowhunters often find themselves brawling with demons, always dress so that you are ready to fight. If you can afford it, opt for leather pants and jackets, since Shadowhunters often wear these because they look bad-ass AND stand up to serious wear and tear. If the cost of leather is too much (or if you have a moral objection to animal products), go with another durable material, like denim.


Also, choose form-fitting clothes rather than loose ones, since you don’t want to give those pesky demons any extra handholds to seize.
Some characters, like Isabelle, stray from the rough-and-tumble look and dress more femininely. So whether you're dressing up for one night only or every single night of the week, go ahead and stray from the Sarah Connor aesthetic if you like. However, be sure that whatever articles of clothing you choose fit comfortably and allow you a wide range of movement so you're ready to kick some butt at any time.

, Unless you plan on wearing no jacket at all, wear short-sleeves or sleeveless tops. This way you can slip your form-fitting jacket on and off without anything bunching up along your arms. Also, if you take the time and care to draw some authentic-looking runes on your body like a true Shadowhunter, be sure to keep your arms clear so you can easily show off your fantastic body art!


If you take your fashion cues from Alec, only wear sleeveless tops, since Alec wears a sleeveless leather jacket, too.
If you plan on dressing like a Shadowhunter all the time (as opposed to a one-time costume), feel free to disregard this step and wear long sleeves, since Shadowhunters generally try to keep their runes hidden from view.

, Remember: they’re not just made for walking. Keep your feet well-protected with a tough pair of black boots when you go out stomping evil creatures. If you opt to wear a mini-skirt instead of pants, and if you happen to be very petite, choose a pair of knee-high boots to catch other people’s eye.

, Draw runes on your body. Wear military-style belts, or even a utility belt. Bring a dagger or sword with you to stand in for your seraph blade (which magically extends from a dagger to a sword with an incantation). Be sure to only carry replicas, however, for physical safety and legal purposes.


If you are going out as any characters, carry a stele with you, since every character has one.
If you are dressing up as Isabelle, find a bracelet that resembles a whip, since she wears her whip as a bracelet.

, In The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, none of her siblings believe that she had found a magical land. But the professor convinces them to believe her because she has always told the truth in the past. So be really honest.

, Lucy is lovable, so you should be really kind. Also, in the movies, she is a peacekeeper between her siblings, so you should be too. Be really loving towards your family, and don""t start arguments. Also, when Eustace is a brat, she is still always nice to him, so treat others the way you want to be treated.

, Lucy has a special connection with Aslan, but the others don't believe her when she thinks she's seen him. Still, she knows she's right.

, Believe in the supernatural, magical creatures, and Narnia.

, You really have a lot of options for this, depending on whether your going for her description in the book of how she looks, or how she looks in the movies. Also, each movie has a different hairstyle. If your going for book looks, flowing golden hair is necessary. In the movies, though, she has brown hair. Either get it straight and at the chin, straight and just below the shoulder (she wears it half up half down or in braids), or medium-long and wavy with a headband or ribbon (in England) or in a side ponytail (on the Dawn Treader).

, Buy lots of hair ribbons, blouses, cardigans, vintage dresses, plaid skirts, khaki or chino pants, and low heals or ballet flats. Go pretty preppy, but don't wear oxford shirts or polos, because those aren't Lucy-like. Don't wear much makeup.

, Lucy is smart.

, Lucy offers to do things for other people.

, According to Eustace, Lucy reads lots of fanciful novels and fairy tales, and probably romance too.

, This is probably most important.

Pick a design.,
Choose its placement.,
Use cutouts.,
Draw your tattoos freehanded.",How to Look Like a Shadowhunter2," Search online or in companion books for runes that are specific to the Shadowhunters universe. Since runes are the source of Shadowhunters’ powers, decide which powers you would personally like to have. Examples include Angelic Power, Clarity, Courage in Combat, and Mental Excellence., Since Shadowhunters often try to keep their runes hidden from sight, pick an area that would normally be covered by clothing. Even if you plan on hitting the streets without long sleeves, keep your character authentic and avoid areas like the back of your hand, neck, and face.


If possible, ask a friend to draw the runes on you, since this will allow you to cover more area with more runes than you could manage on your own.
If you don't have anyone to assist you, stick to easy-to-reach places like your chest, stomach, arms, as well as the tops of your thighs. Depending on your flexibility, you could also possibly include more of your legs.

, For runes with more intricate designs, or even simple ones if you would rather not attempt drawing them freehanded, print each design from your computer. Use scissors to crop the paper until you have a rough square around the image. Then trace around the edges of the design, both inside and out, with a utility blade or exacto knife to create a cutout for stenciling. Tape the outside edges of the cutout to your skin and stencil yourself first with waterproof eyeliner, which will help prevent your rune from running should you start to sweat or otherwise get wet.When you create your cutout, be sure to save any blank paper that has been cut from the inside of the design (such as the squarish piece in the center of the Angelic Power rune) so you can tape these pieces separately to your skin in order to complete the stencil.
Do not use kohl pencils, since this material will rub off onto your clothes.

, If you don't have a printer, practice drawing your rune on paper a few times before you attempt to draw the rune directly onto your skin. Once you feel confident, tattoo yourself freehanded with black eyeshadow, since this is easy to wipe off your skin in case you slip up. Once you are happy with the result, trace over the eyeshadow with waterproof eyeliner for a longer lasting temporary tattoo that will keep its shape despite sweating. However, before applying any new products that you haven’t used before, apply a little bit to a small patch of skin to test whether or not you have any adverse reactions.If you are drawing your runes on your own body, be sure to practice drawing them according to your view of the area where it will be place. For example, if it will be on your chest, practice drawing the design upside-down since this matches your view of your own chest.

Cut a wooden dowel into three pieces.Since you want one long piece and two shorter pieces of equal length, measure and mark the dowel first.,
Tape the three pieces together.,
Reinforce the stele's body.,
Create texture.,
Color your stele.",How to Look Like a Shadowhunter3," Divide the total length of the dowel by five. Then mark each fifth along the dowel. Use a folding saw to saw off one fifth for each of the two shorter pieces, leaving the longest piece at three-fifths of the dowel’s original length.


Measurements do not need to be perfect, as long as the two shorter pieces are roughly equal and the third is considerably longer.
A dowel that is roughly a foot long before cutting is an ideal length.

, First, tear a short strip of packing tape from your roll. Lay it on your worktable horizontally, with the sticky-side up. Set the dowel pieces on the tape, in the middle, with the longest piece in the center and the tops of all three lined up. Fold the excess tape over the dowel pieces to secure them together.The shorter pieces should pinch together when you tape all three together.

, First, fix a pen to your stele’s body.Lay another short strip of packing tape on your worktable, sticky-side up. Lay a pen or thin marker on top of it. Then lay the longest dowel piece alongside it, so that the pen’s tip extends a little bit past the bottom of the dowel. Fold the excess tape over the pen and dowel to secure them. Then wrap more packing tape around your stele’s body, excluding the pen’s tip.Secure the end of the tape to either the top or bottom the dowel. Wrap the body with tape in an over-under action until the body is roughly of a uniform thickness.


If you plan on actually drawing runes on your skin or someone else’s, consider using a henna pen so avoid ink poisoning.

, Use strips of duct tape to shape runes on the stele’s body. Search online for specific Shadowhunter rune designs. Sculpt the duct tape into your favorite designs and stick them to the stele’s body. Then tear off enough strips of packing tape to cover the rune sculptures. Use your fingers to gently mold the packing tape to the shape of the duct tape underneath.If you prefer having a smooth stele, skip this step and simply ink your runes onto the body later.

, For quickest results, spray the packing tape with silver, gray, or white spray-paint. Allow it to dry for the amount of time indicated in the direction (usually anywhere from five minutes to one hour, depending on the product). Then use markers to color the raised sculpted runes with darker shades, such as black or dark gray. Or, if you chose to keep your stele smooth, use a fine-tipped marker to design your runes.You can also use oil based paints to detail your stele, but these will likely take a very long time to dry. Watercolors will most likely be too thin to effectively coat the packing tape.

Eat healthy.",How to Be Like Remy Starr from This Lullaby,"  Luckily, Remy's style is pretty laid back and easy to emulate.  Her wardrobe mainly consists of tank tops, black pants, jackets, jeans, plain T-shirts, sweaters, sandals, and boxer shorts for lounging around.  Her go-to color is red.  It was mentioned in the book that Remy shops in the clearance section at the Gap, which sells many of these types of clothing articles.  It has been said by Remy's friends that Remy has ""really nice clothes,"" so be sure to stock up on some fashion-forward pieces as well!
,  Remy was a total neat freak.  Keep your closet organized and have a section for each type of clothing.  Don't leave dirty laundry laying around, and fold your clothes immediately after washing them.  Never leave your bed unmade.  Vacuum and clean your room and car regularly.  Keep C.D.'s, books, etc. alphabetized.  Staying organized is worth the extra effort if it makes your belongings easier to locate.,  Remy's goal was to get into Stanford, and she did.  Be sure to challenge yourself like Remy did, and put in the effort it takes to get good grades.  Remy took several AP classes and honors seminars and studied a lot.  She took the SATs three times to get the score she wanted.  Don't get too distracted with extracurriculars.  If you struggle with a particular class (like physics, in Remy's case), do not worry.  Try to find a tutor and remind yourself that you can do this.,  Remy said herself she was known for having an active social life.  She went to parties and night clubs on a regular basis. In high school, Remy had a reputation for partying.  Don't be friends with everybody.  Remy had a small, but close-knit group of girls that were her best friends.  So be supportive of your closest girls, and they will be there for you.,  Remy may have been somewhat of a slut, but she knew what she was doing when it came to guys.  Go out with guys, but still try to have standards.  For example, if a guy cheats on you, make it clear that things between you are over.  Try to have the upper hand and don't get too committed unless he is really worth it.,  Remy was smart and beautiful and she knew it. Many guys find confidence an attractive quality in a girl. However, don't go around bragging about yourself. Remy knew she was one-of-a-kind, and so did others; she didn't need to go around talking about it.,  Remy was not afraid of bullies, and she definitely knew how to stand her ground.  So stick up for your friends and family members, even if you guys have your differences.  Look people in the eye during confrontations so they know that you are a force to be reckoned with.,  If there was one thing Remy hated, it was a loss of control.  Don't get falling down drunk all the time; that is not being in control.  And don't let hookups go further than YOU want them to, regardless of what the guy wants.  Don't be a doormat.  Remy was easily able to say no to people because of her experiences with her mother. Not catering to people helps maintain that ""cool"" image Remy wanted to project. Remy rarely lost her temper, and she was good at keeping her emotions in tact. Try to emulate her calm demeanor.,  Remy was described and being ""blond and thin"" more than once.  She drinks lots of Diet Coke and coffee with milk in the mornings.  She eats a healthy breakfast, like oatmeal with bananas and muffins.  If you really need to slide, treat yourself to some cake and champagne.  Also, try to avoid ginger ale and mayonnaise.  Remy hated them."

Get Hanna's style.,
Learn your brands!,
Carry what you need in your purse.,
Be up-to-date with the world.,
Emulate Hanna's personality.,
Be independent.,
Be self-motivated.,
Have some class.,
Be confident.",How to Emulate Hanna Marin from Pretty Little Liars," If you're already blonde, you're good to go! If not you can still get highlights or even dye it completely! However, getting Hanna's hair really isn't all about the colour - what's more important is that it looks great and will flatter your natural skin tone and face shape. Hanna's hair is always styled in curls. Alternate the way you curl them around your curling iron for a messier ""Hanna"" look. When you get to the front of your hair, though, curl the hair away from your face. For makeup, her eyes are always rimmed in black eyeliner, and she always sports a pink lip shade. In season 3 she has more natural eyes with a smoky look at the lash line. Hanna also gets her hair cut short in season 5 so if it is short look at season 5.;
, Hanna borrows elements of everyone’s wardrobe to create looks that are strikingly chic with touches of trendiness, femininity, and glam. Hanna looks like she’s heading to a hip soiree every day, even when she's just going to class. Her look is very young Hollywood: it’s flirty and girly with a trendy edge. To get Hanna's style you don't necessarily have to shop at expensive stores, but you absolutely need to be unique!


Try ruffles or brightly-colored blazers.

, Just because you don't have to dress in expensive clothing doesn't mean you shouldn't know all the brands by heart! Spend some time looking at websites online for brands like Tory Burch and Splendid. If you comment on fancy brands, people will think you have them.

, Hanna loves her cell phone, so always carry yours with you! Also, keep light pink lipstick, lip gloss, a flashlight, and a nail file at all times.

, Hanna is especially savvy in fashion, so be sure you know what is going on and stay up-to-date on trends. You should also be informed about political events, music, and things of the sort. This doesn't mean you have to be a girl who only shops at exclusive stores. You can find cute things anywhere if you look.

, Hanna is hot, and she knows it! Her confidence makes her sparkle. She can be very sarcastic, but she's always up for a good time. Try to be confident and independent, and let people know your rules. Fun-loving and a little wild, she is all kinds of feisty and tough. Being popular is important to her, but being a true friend to her girls matters more to her than anything.

, Hanna is never one to conform to something she doesn't believe in. Being independent does not mean being sassy and rude to authority, though. Follow your heart and what you believe in. And follow your instincts - you never know when they may come in handy.

, Don't wait for others to initiate anything. Do it yourself and get things going when no one else will.

, Be tactful and have standards; they will get you further than you may think. People will always be mean, no matter how nice you are, so don't think about it.

, No matter what your hair or makeup looks like, being confident will always draw people to you. But don't be cocky! There's a border between confidence and arrogance.

A solid pink long-sleeved sweater works well, but you can also choose one with a pattern on it. Another option would be to wear a short-sleeved pink sweater or pink sweater vest over a long-sleeved white shirt.;
, Look for a bright purple skirt that stops at or around the knee.


The skirt should be bouncy and fun.
Just like the sweater, you can have fun with the skirt. A solid purple skirt works, but you can choose one with a print if you like that option better.

, Once you have the sweater and skirt on, you need to cover your feet with knee-high white socks.


Mimic Junie B. even better by pulling one sock up to the knee while allowing the other sock to crumple down into a heap above your ankle.

, Even though Junie B. is often shown wearing other types of footwear, her original favorites were classic black Mary Jane shoes.


If you can't find Mary Jane shoes, wear simple canvas sneakers instead.

, If you want your hair to match, too, you might need to wear a brown wig.


When she was in kindergarten, Janie B. had short brown hair cut into a bob that stopped just above her shoulders.
After becoming a first grader, her hair grew down to her shoulders and became a little messier.

, In kindergarten, Junie B. almost always wore a bow in her hair. By the time she entered the first grade, she stopped wearing hair bows and started wearing purple glasses.You can pick one accessory or the other, or you can wear both together. The choice is yours to make.
Any hair bow should work. For a twist, you could even wear a big flower hair clip. If you do not have a bow or flower that you want to wear, though, you can make one simply by following the instructions provided in the “Hair Bow” section of this article.
If you cannot find purple glasses, you can make your own using purple pipe cleaners. See the “Purple Glasses” section of this article for more information.

, One piece of ribbon should be about the same length as the wearer's forearm—the portion of your arm between your elbow and your hand. The second piece of ribbon should only be about 4 inches (10 cm) long.


Cut the ribbon using scissors or sewing shears.
This project should be completed with the help of a teenager or adult. Steps that require the use of scissors or hot glue should not be performed by a young child.

, Lay the longer strip flat, then fold the two ends in toward the center of the ribbon.


You'll fold one-third of the left side in followed by one-third of the right side. The two ends should overlap at the middle of the ribbon.

, Carefully apply a dot of hot glue to the top of the left end (or whichever end is on the bottom of the stack). Press the bottom of the other end into this dot of glue.


Allow the glue to cool and dry before continuing.
If preferred, you could sew the two ends together instead of gluing them in place.

, Take the second, smaller strip of ribbon and wrap it around the center of the first piece.


This piece of ribbon should cover the seam of the longer piece.
Wrap tightly. You should wrap the second piece so tightly that it squeezes the center of the first piece, giving it a bow-like shape.

, Once you have completely wound the second ribbon around the first, apply a little hot glue to the bottom side of the second ribbon's loose end. Press it in place over the center of the bow.


The seam of this second piece should be at the back of the bow, where the hidden seam of the first piece is.
Allow the glue to dry before continuing.
You can use a needle and thread instead of glue if you would prefer to do so.

, Apply a small dot of glue to the bottom center of the bow. Press the glue-covered portion onto the top side of a plain plastic headband.


The exact placement of the bow is your decision, but to mimic Janie B. Jones as well as possible, you should position it toward the top of the headband yet slightly off toward one side.Let the glue dry.

, When the bow is firmly attached to the headband, your accessory is complete and ready to wear. Put it on when you wear the rest of your Junie B. Jones outfit.

, Take one purple pipe cleaner and cut it in half using a pair of wire cutters or sharp, durable scissors.


Set the two halves aside for now.
Note that an older child or adult should take care of this step. The remaining steps can be performed by adults and children of all ages.

, Take a second purple pipe cleaner and bend one end so that it forms a ""P"" shape.


The closed part of the ""P"" should come down to a place just above the mid-point of the pipe cleaner.
Lock the bend in place by wrapping the end around the straight part of the pipe cleaner once.

, Take the other end of the same pipe cleaner and bend it into a backwards ""P"" shape.


The rounded part of the backwards ""P"" should face the same direction as the rounded part of the forward facing ""P."" It should also be approximately the same size.
These two ""P"" shapes will form the eyes of the glasses.

, Take one half of the cut pipe cleaner and wrap one end around the outer side of one glasses eye.


Position this piece at the center of the eye piece's outer edge.
You only need to wrap the end of this pipe cleaner half around the eye frame once or twice to hold it in place.

, Bend the free end of the attached pipe cleaner half slightly, creating a ""J"" shaped hook.


The point of the hook should face downward.
This piece forms one stem of the glasses. The hook needs to be able to sit on top of and behind your ear.

, Take the other cut pipe cleaner half and wrap it around the other glasses eye in the same way you wrapped the first.


You also need to bend the free end of that pipe cleaner half into a hook so that it will fit behind your other ear.

, Your purple glasses are now complete. Try them on, make any necessary adjustments to improve the way they feel, and wear them with the rest of your Junie B. Jones outfit.

, This is a Stacey trademark. Her clothes always match, but she would not think twice about wearing clothes in, say, magenta or bright orange, or about wearing unusually patterned clothes. Extra points for New York City themes, as Stacey is from New York City.

, Stacey is type 1 diabetic, so she cannot eat sweets.


That said, do not object when people around you eat sweets. Stacey doesn't care about that.

, Don't look down your nose at people, but have an air of big-city sophistication.

, Stacey is known for having pierced ears (just one hole in each ear, though). That said, if you have a septum piercing, disguise it. Stacey tries a clip earring in the nose in one book, but then vows never to have any part of her nose pierced at all.

, Make sure that Goobaw has either no clothes at all or just a bow tie. Also make sure that the teddy bear you use is of the right size to hug and is a color that a real bear would be. This is mentioned in a special volume in the series, Stacey's Book. Stacey holds on to Goobaw when she is scared, and he goes with her when she goes to the hospital for her diabetes.

, A protractor, a ruler, or a four-function calculator would work great for this. Stacey is a math whiz, and she loves anything to do with numbers.

, Write numbers, not letters. Stacey is the treasurer of the club.

, The Chronicles of Narnia are set in the 1940s, during the Second World War, so the characters dress really old-fashionably. Wear plaid skirts with blouses and cardigans, and knee-high or ankle socks with lace-up shoes to give off that 1941 feel.

, Susan is incredibly intelligent, and can often be found with her head in a book. It doesn't have to be a boring book - make sure you like it.

, As mentioned, Susan is incredibly intelligent, and does very well in school. So, study hard for tests and exams, complete homework on time and pay attention during class.

, Throughout The Chronicles of Narnia, Susan is seen as the voice of logic and common sense. Keep calm in the face of a crisis, and think of the best solution to solve it. Be quick-witted and alert, and always trust your instinct. Susan is very down-to-earth and finds it hard to believe in the impossible. She is the most surprised to find out that Narnia exists.

, (If you have one, of course). Susan and her sister Lucy are very close, and she is very protective of her. Give your sister at least one hug every day, and depending on what age she is, do fun stuff together - go to the mall, give her a makeover etc.

, Susan fights during the battle scenes in the movies, not only shooting arrows, but spinning them too, and using her bow as a shield and knocking Telmarine soldiers out of the way with it.

, All the Pevensies and most of the other characters in Narnia can horse ride, so if you're not already doing so, sign up for horse riding classes.

, She doesn't have the title High Queen Susan The Gentle for nothing. Treat others like you would like to be treated, and never, EVER be the one to start a fight. However, if you disagree with something, state your point calmly but also try to see the other person's point of view."

Understand Yoda's sentence structures.,
Practice rephrasing common sentences to fit Yoda's style.,
Study some of Yoda's most famous lines.,
Practice the sound of his voice.,
Be mindful of Yoda's vocal cadence and tonality.,
Record yourself speaking like Yoda.,
Hone Yoda's appearance.,
Learn when to use the impersonation.,
Collect audio of Yoda speaking.,
Watch the Star Wars films.",How to Speak Like Yoda," It is theorized that Yoda's grammar is very similar to how ancient humans spoke in 50,000 B.C. Yoda tends to structure his sentence in the subject-object-verb agreement manner instead of our modern way of structuring sentences with the subject-verb-object agreement. For example, ""I play soccer"" becomes ""Soccer, I play."" when Yoda says it.
""This is my home."" --> ""My home, this is.""
""I will stay and help you."" --> ""Stay and help you, I will."";
, Choose some simple sentences that you use daily and restructure them to conform to Yoda's ancient grammatical tendencies.


""Have a good night."" --> ""A good night, have.""
""I feel great."" --> ""Great I feel.""
""You look tired."" --> ""Tired you look.""

, Here are some common phrases that people often associate with Yoda:""If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did to Obi-Wan's apprentice.""
""Difficult to see, always in motion is the future.""
""Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you, it can.""

, Yoda has a slightly croaky, throaty voice that occasionally cracks and breaks. Try forming your voice in the back of your throat to give it that throaty, gargling sound.

, Yoda's pace of speaking is very important to be aware of. He speaks quite quickly at times but with an intelligible rhythm. Yoda's words and sentences are also full of rises and falls in tonality. Practicing this helps express meaning, especially when tricky grammar is involved. Mimic accordingly.

, Once you feel like you are executing a good impersonation of Yoda, record yourself impersonating a line of Yoda's and then compare it to an actual clip of Yoda speaking the same line.

, Making an accompanying Yoda pose can add to the effect of your impersonation. He is slightly feeble, but is capable of surprising physical feats, so don't overdo the crippled appearance. To really seal the deal, wear the following items:


A burlap sack wrapped around your shoulders
A dark orange turtleneck
A brown, wooden cane
A green lightsaber

, There are many social situations when doing an impersonation is funny or appropriate, but there are also many social situations when an impersonation can be seen as poorly timed or bad taste. Be prudent in choosing when and where to show off your Yoda impersonation.

, At this point in the learning process, don't worry about trying to sound exactly like Yoda yet. Focused listening is an essential first step for your mind to begin to process the recognizable garble and grit of Yoda's voice.


Watch video clips of Yoda online
Peruse this compendium of Yoda audio files: http://www.yodajeff.com/multimedia/sounds


, Assuming you've already seen all of the movies, return to them to find particular scenes that heavily feature Yoda and his signature verbal mannerisms. Pick from one of the following films, or just watch all of them!


Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999)
Episode II: Attack of the Clones (2002)

Have a healthy diet and stick to it.,
Exercise daily to stay fit.,
Get plenty of sleep.",How to Be Like MacKenzie Hollister from Dork Diaries1," Mackenzie is very healthy. In fact, in Dork Diaries Book One, it is said that Mackenzie eats tofu salad! If you don't already have a healthy diet, construct one using the food pyramid. Make sure you include a variety of healthy foods in your daily diet to ensure you get all the nutrients you need. However, depending on what types of food groups you consume the most (like grains), you may have to alternate the amount of nutrients you ingest to get the wonderful body of Mackenzie Hollister.


For example, if you are eating too much from the fats/oils group, you should try to replace a sugary snack with a healthy fruit or vegetable.
If you aren't sure what nutrients you're lacking, it's best to ask your doctor and/or parents for advice on what to eat.
Drink lots of water! Drinking more water can improve your complexion, increase your energy, stop headaches, and make you feel better. You should drink at least a 1/32 your body weight of water per day.;
, Mackenzie is in very good shape. Make it a habit to exercise for thirty minutes every day. If you find that you don't have enough time or energy to exercise for the entire thirty minutes, split the thirty minutes into three ten-minute sessions, spreading them throughout the day evenly―ten minutes in the morning, ten minutes in the afternoon, and ten minutes in the evening.


Look up workout routines to learn how to strengthen and tone certain parts of your body.
Most schools have the Presidential Fitness Test in gym class. Try to pass each category as (at least) national.
Work on your splits. In Dork Diaries Book One, it specifically notes that Mackenzie ended her dance routine with a split. To stretch for a split, you should do the following every morning and night:


Straddle stretch―do this for two minutes total.

Butterfly stretch―do this for one minute.

Pigeon stretch―do this for one minute per side.



, Go to bed at a reasonable time and get up right away in the morning when your alarm clock wakes you up. If you lounge in bed or go back to sleep, you'll have lots of trouble falling asleep that night, and you'll also be late for school. Also, exercising daily will help you fall asleep faster at night because you will have used up all your energy and there will be none left to keep you awake.


Avoid cramming and doing homework late at night, as this will deprive you of the sleep you need and affect your entire day.
If you find that you have trouble sleeping, look up suggestions and try different methods to put yourself to sleep faster.
Don't set your alarm clock too early. Instead, adjust your morning routine a little so that you can get all the hours of sleep that you need. For example, take away five minutes from styling your hair so that you can get a bit more sleep.
Start setting out your clothes for the next morning before you go to sleep so that you aren't rummaging through your closet for an outfit to wear in the morning. You can do different things every ten minutes to prepare for the next day. For example, in the morning, Mackenzie would do yoga for ten minutes.

Wash your face twice a day―once in the morning and once at night.,
When washing your face, use an effective cleanser that isn't too harsh on your face.,
After applying the cleanser to your face, gently rinse it off with lukewarm water.,
Follow up with a toner to close the pores on your skin and give it a refreshing feeling.,
After the cleanser and toner, you'll need to apply a good moisturizer to prevent your skin from becoming dehydrated.,
If necessary, apply face scrubs and creams to your face.,
Take vitamins for teenage girls, such as ""Take One a Day Teen Advantage For Her"".,
If you wear makeup, immediately wash it off when you get home to prevent clogged pores and dirty skin.,
A healthy diet, daily exercise, a little sun, and plenty of sleep will also help to keep your complexion clear and pimple-free.",How to Be Like MacKenzie Hollister from Dork Diaries2," Mackenzie has a flawless complexion, so establishing this habit is very important. If you go one day without washing your face, the chances of your skin and face breaking out into nasty pimples are greatly increased.

, If your cleanser is cheap or ineffective, you may still end up with pimples. Also, be sure you aren't allergic to any of the ingredients in the cleanser. One safe and effective way to see if you're allergic to the cleanser is to gently rub some onto your arm to see if you get a rash or bad reaction after twenty-four hours. If your skin remains clear, that is a good sign that you might be able to use it on your face. If your skin reacts negatively to the cleanser, purchase a different brand. The best type of cleanser is the kind with all-natural ingredients.

, Never use cold or hot water on your face, since they may irritate your skin and cause flare-ups, especially for people with severe acne.One of the ways you could make sure you effectively rinse off the cleanser is to use a cotton pad that is gentle on your skin.

, Facial toner is important, as it also helps clear oil and dirt from your pores. Your facial cleanser may be in charge of cleaning off the grime, but you'll want to make sure the job has been completed before turning in for the night.

, You don't need to avoid moisturizing your pimples. While you may believe that giving your pimples moisture prevents them from healing and going away, your pimples cannot heal at all unless if you provide them with the right amount of moisturizer. However, be careful about applying oil-containing moisturizers, and avoid applying too much moisturizer, as these could result in more pimples.

, But make sure you don't apply too many or you may get more pimples. However, if you're already washing your face twice a day with an effective cleanser, toner, and moisturizer that is appropriate for your skin, then masks, scrubs, and creams are not entirely necessary.

, These vitamins will help keep your face healthy and provide your skin with the necessary nutrients it needs to keep your complexion clear and shining. However, read all the instructions pasted on the label to prevent yourself from overdosing on them. Also, make sure you aren't allergic to any of the ingredients used in the vitamins.


Make sure you don't try too many new things at once, for if you have a bad reaction to one of them, you will be unable to tell which one was the cause of your reaction! Use one new thing per week and let your skin slowly adjust to the new items you're introducing to it.

, If you don't wash it off right away, make sure you at least remove it before you go to sleep, no matter how tired you are. Otherwise, it may result in dirty pores and more pimples in the morning.

, Although the results won't happen overnight, you'll most likely be able to gradually see the changes in your skin if you use the right products and eat the right foods.

Follow the old rule: brush your teeth twice a day and floss once a day.,
Take a shower every day.,
Limit your hair washing to three times a week.,
Prevent chapped lips by applying lip balm onto your lips frequently.,
Keep your nails trimmed at an appropriate length.,
Show up at all of your doctor and dentist appointments, no matter how much you hate going there.",How to Be Like MacKenzie Hollister from Dork Diaries3," As boring and time-consuming it may sound, it's necessary for you to follow this rule in order to ensure good health and a beautiful smile that's free of yellow teeth and unattractive stains. Brushing your teeth will also help keep your breath fresh. Purchase an effective toothpaste and make sure you change your toothbrush every few months, because your toothbrush's bristles will eventually wear out.


For an extra layer of good breath, swish mouthwash around your mouth for a minute before you leave the house in the morning. Using mouthwash at night isn't necessary, but it still kills odor-causing bacteria in your mouth.
You can also chew minty gum during the day to get gunk out of your teeth and maintain fresh breath.

, Use a good-smelling soap that will effectively clean the dirt off of your skin without irritating it. Adjust the water until it's lukewarm, and limit your shower time to six minutes.


Be sure to use a shower cap on days that you are not washing your hair.
Hot water harms your skin and damages your skin cells, since the blood vessels in your face have to expand/contract. Cold water is too cold for your skin.

, If you wash it every day, it will wear out easily and become dull and dry. Use an effective shampoo and conditioner appropriate for your hair type while making sure it brings a pleasant smell that will prevent your hair from reeking. Do not postpone washing your hair if desperately needed. This will cause dandruff and oil to form on your scalp, resulting in greasy, dusty hair.


If you have naturally oily hair, wash it four times a week.
Refrain from blow-drying your hair or using heat on your hair often. Heat is your hair's worst enemy, and frequent usage of heat will cause your hair to form split ends, go limp, and become very dry. Try air-drying your hair since this is both healthy and more comfortable.

If you're afraid of getting your clothes wet, wrap a towel around your wet hair while it dries.



, This keeps your lips moisturized, especially during the cold winter days. Avoid licking your lips to moisten them. While it may be effective for a while, your lips will begin to chap and become inflamed. Ripping off dried skin on your lips will also damage your lips and possibly result in bleeding.


A great method to ensure moisturized lips throughout the night is to apply lip balm to your lips before you go to sleep. In the morning, your lips should feel moisturized. Apply lip balm throughout the day to lock the good, moisturized feeling in.
Use a smooth, good-smelling lip balm. Burt's Bees brand lip balm is a good choice. It comes in lots of flavors, and it works really well.
Even though EOS lip balm comes in a cute container, it is expensive, and it actually dries your lips out more than it moisturizes them.

, Clean out any dirt and grime from your nails every day. If you want to go even further, go to the spa to get your nails done every two or three weeks, or give yourself your own manicure and pedicure at home, using natural ingredients and household items.

, They are there to keep you healthy and make sure you look good―it's not rocket science! If your teeth aren't perfectly straight, get braces to straighten them out. This will ensure that you have a beautiful smile.

Grow your hair long if it already isn't long since Mackenzie has long, wavy, blonde hair.,
Since Mackenzie has blue eyes, wear blue eye contacts to change your eye color without getting surgery.,
Curl your eyelashes if they aren't long.,
When you wear makeup, make it look completely natural.,
Although Mackenzie purchases loads of expensive items, you don't necessarily have to splurge on a bunch of items that you will never use.,
Mackenzie wears designer clothes, shoes, jewelry, perfume, and other accessories, so consider wearing them as well.,
Mackenzie wears designer handbags and has lots of them, so consider getting your own.",How to Be Like MacKenzie Hollister from Dork Diaries4," Temporarily dye your hair blonde in case you don't end up liking the color. If you permanently dye your hair blonde, you won't be able to change it! Curl your hair with a good curling iron or wand to get Mackenzie's waves. However, for natural waves, sleep in with a tight French braid overnight, and in the morning, you'll have natural waves when you take out the braid. You don't have to curl your hair every day, though. In fact, in the books, Mackenzie styles her hair a variety of ways!

Style your hair nicely, but not too fancily. Make sure to brush it in the morning, and maybe take a brush to school if you need to. Pinterest has lots of good hairstyle ideas, but here are a few.

Simple braid(s)
French braid(s)
Dutch braid(s)
High/Low/Side ponytails

Fishtail Braid(s) (might fall out or get too loose during the day, so be careful)

Simple Bun(s) (can be difficult and might fall out during the day)
Half up/Half down
Experiment with the place you part your hair
Curled/Straightened
Wavy high ponytail



, If you don't want to do that because of the cost of eye contacts, you can skip this step.

, It is stated in the books that Mackenzie always bats her long lashes. However, refrain from curling your eyelashes too often, since it can be harmful to them! Instead, stick to wearing fake lashes or using volumizing mascara that will help thicken your eyelashes and increase their length.

, To ensure you get the good, natural results you desire, be sure you have purchased makeup that perfectly matches your skin tone. (Even if you think no one will notice, a wrong color will stand out more than you think!) Wear a little bit of eyeliner, mascara, and―most importantly―Brand lip gloss. Mackenzie is completely obsessed with lip gloss and always wears it.


Be sure to wear colors that complement your face. Don't wear colors that look bad on you, even if Mackenzie wears them.

, It's best to save your money for other items you might want in the future instead of spending it all just to be like Mackenzie.

, Some brands that Mackenzie wears are ""Juicy Couture"", ""Vera Bradley"", ""Jimmy Choo"", and ""Prada"". Wear pink clothing, and make sure they don't have any designs on them (like a plain pink blouse).


Remember that Mackenzie loves fashion. She drew fashion illustrations and entered them in her school's Avant-Garde Art Competition. She also did a Fashion Column for her school newspaper. Consider becoming a Fashion Expert.
If you are unable to go shopping or don't have enough money to purchase designer brands, you could ask someone you know if they have any designer clothes that they cannot fit in or don't want anymore.
You don't need to buy a lot of designer clothes if you can't afford or find any. Clothes that look good on you and match other things you have are just as good.
Consider buying a small Vera Bradley cross-body bag. They are not too expensive, and people will easily recognize it as a Vera Bradley product.
Other brands you could purchase items from are ""Michael Kors"", ""Neiman Marcus"", ""Burberry"", ""Fendi"", ""Tom Ford"", ""Yves Saint Laurent"", ""Coach"", ""Guess"", ""Louis Vuitton"", ""Kate Spade"", and ""Gucci"".

""Tommy Hilfiger"", and ""Ralph Lauren"" are other brands you could wear.



, You really only need one or two, and they do not have to be a designer handbag. It is a good idea to purchase a plain black one first. If you have enough money and confidence, you can move on to more colorful ones.


Buying a Vera Bradley crossbody bag is a good idea. They are relatively cheap and colorful, and they stand out. Everyone will notice it and know that you are wearing a Vera Bradley bag.
Obviously, if you are not allowed to bring bags to school, do not bring them.

Try to add some of Mackenzie's likes to your own.,
Mackenzie has an excellent cell phone, and she is one of the biggest gossipers in school.,
Mackenzie has an awesome and girly bedroom that screams her personality, so remodel your room and add items/posters that express yourself.,
Have the attitude and act the part.,
Be as popular as you can by being a social butterfly in school.,
Be a good role model and be the person everyone looks up to.,
Do well in school.,
Surround yourself with friends.,
Have a table that you and your friends always sit at.,
If you like a boy, go and get him.,
Decorate your locker on the inside and/or outside.,
Always have a change of clothes in your locker that is not embarrassing.",How to Be Like MacKenzie Hollister from Dork Diaries5," Also, try to be good at the things she is good at, but it's fine if you find that you don't have the talent she has in some areas. Some of the activities Mackenzie is good at are the following:



Ballet (Dork Diaries Book One)

Speaking French (Dork Diaries Book One)

Dancing/Choreography (Book Three)

Ice Skating (Book Four)

Swimming (Book Six)

Skiing (Book Seven)

Dodgeball and Other Sports (Book Eight)

Drawing (Book Nine)

Take interest in all these things and take lessons for any activities that you might need help in, such as dancing, ballet, and ice skating.









, Therefore, in order to be able to gossip and chat easily with your friends, you will need your own cell phone (if you don't already have one). Try to avoid cruddy cell phones.


Some suggested cell phone brands are:

iPhone
Galaxy
Titan
HTC
Nokia
Huawei


Some good service providers are:

Verizon
Sprint
T-Mobile
At&t
Metro PCS


If you can't afford a cell phone, or if your parents won't let you buy one, use a different device. Your parents will most likely let you buy any device that isn't a cell phone. Then, download Skype, Facebook, Twitter, Musically, Youtube, or other social networking apps your friends use. You can have a Mackenzie whining episode in front of your friends if your parents won't let you have a cell phone. Or, you can tell them that your parents are super overprotective of you and won't let you have one.
If you do have a cell phone (or a camera or small device), keep it on you at all times. If something embarrassing happens to someone (specifically, your enemies) you need to be able to document it with pictures or videos. Having dirt on someone is a great way to get what you want. However, if you are going to blackmail someone, do not take it too far, as this could get you in serious trouble.

, The walls of her room are painted in different shades of pink. She also has a laptop, a flat-screen television, and a canopy bed. She also owns an enormous closet and has a bathroom attached to her bedroom. You don't have to splurge your money when remodeling your room. There are many inexpensive options available.


Have yummy-scented items in your bathroom. Consider getting some strawberry scented soap and cupcake body spray.

, It isn't only about the material items and the look―you also have to have confidence in yourself and know you're beautiful while loving yourself! How do you expect people to love you if you can't even love yourself?

, Befriend all the cool and popular people at school. While avoiding conversations with geeky or unpopular people at school, act neutral towards them without any signs of disdain or arrogance towards them so that they can't say you're snobby or mean towards them. However, do not be too nice to them or the popular people will dump you! Reserve your compliments for your close friends or family.


Do not be mean or cruel to anyone, no matter how much you dislike that person. Everyone wants to be friends with Mackenzie. Although it isn't guaranteed that everyone will want to be your friend, make sure you are nice and neutral to those that aren't your friends so no one can accuse you of being mean.
Becoming popular at school is hard. But there are some strategies you can use to put yourself in the popular circles (it is recommended that you spent a few days scoping out the people in the school and the groups you want to be a part of if you don't already know the people):

Walk up to a smaller group of populars (when a break in their conversation occurs), point out a weird, gross looking girl (especially one you have seen them fighting with or insulting), and ask them, ""what's her deal?"", or ""why is she wearing that?"" This strategy works because it establishes a common enemy, and populars are often big gossipers. If you point out the right girl, they will tell you all the things they don't like about her. Then, just keep a conversation going, and agree with what they have to say.
If you get lucky and get to talk to or work with a group of populars (like in a group project), say things that they will agree with or bring up juicy topics. Let them state their opinion first, and agree to what they say. Just to be safe, do not discuss religion or politics (unless you are absolutely sure they will agree with you).
When you talk to populars, always agree with them, compliment them, and ask them questions (everyone likes it when others are interested in their lives.)
Some interesting conversation topics:

Celebrities and celebrity relationships
Makeup, and how much makeup is too much
Weird things that parents hate
Stories about adorable dogs/siblings
Curling/Straightening your hair―hairstyles
How nail polish chips off your nails right after you paint them



Make sure that your conversation topics leave room for people to add their own comments so that they can do so (this prevents you from just awkwardly standing there after saying something).

Do not just walk up to a group of populars and interrupt their conversation. This will make them automatically dislike you.

Do not walk up to a popular circle and stand there in the group. This is super creepy because the girls don't know you.

Do not only talk to the ""queen bee"". Talk to other girls when she is distracted or away. Make them feel special. You need their support, too.
The ""queen bee"" of a popular group is usually the one that talks the most. If you see people looking up to you, saying things you have said before, or imitating your style, you are on your way to becoming queen bee. The best thing to do from here is to talk more.



, A lot of people admire Mackenzie, so act like you're a model and strut through the hallways as if you're at a Paris fashion show. To be sashay like Mackenzie, flip your hair like you know you're gorgeous, and smile prettily. However, do not overdo it or people will either laugh at you or think you're arrogant and snobby.

, Mackenzie does well in her French class and likes to be especially and genuinely nice to her teachers. She gets good grades and is perfect in her schoolwork and projects. Although there is no such thing as perfect, strive to do well in your schoolwork and projects and give it your all. If you get good grades, you might be liked by the teachers and become a good role-model. However, do not talk about your grades with your friends, or talk about assignments without them asking you first. It's a cruel world out there, and you may be labeled as a nerd or a know-it-all.


Being smart is also part of being Mackenzie, especially when she comes up with schemes to get her way. However, most of the time, Nikki is the main character and Mackenzie is basically the ""bad guy"". Therefore, don't think about this if you want to make schemes against your enemy.

, Make sure your friends are not too different from you, and share some of your interests. They should have cell phones so you can communicate with them. Hang out by your locker before school and during passing periods (if possible).


If you don't have lockers, find somewhere else to hang out together.

, Don't sit with any nerds, dorks, or total losers. Watch who you sit with and avoid food fights. If someone gets food on you, shout at them, and strut very quickly towards the bathroom with two of your friends on both sides so that you can clean up.

, Since you're acting like Mackenzie, twirl your hair, bat your eyelashes, act sweet and nice to him and say ""Oh Hon!"" If you want to, crack good jokes to get him laughing. However, if you're not acting the way you truly would act, he might see straight through you and dislike you.

, If the outside of your locker isn't allowed to be decorated, however, just stick to decorating the inside. Paste cute stickers (make sure they can be easily removed) and pictures of the guy you like, but make sure you don't have too many so that you have room for other things.


If you don't have any time to decorate your locker during school, quickly do it before and/or after school.

, Also, have a few pairs of necessary shoes, such as high-heels, flip-flops, ballet flats, or wedges. Also, have hairbrush and an extra purse. You could also put fancy lotions in your locker. However, don't forget about your school items. Have books for studying and reading in your locker so that you can grab one in case you forgot to study for a test―you can quickly study before class starts.

Be dramatic.,
Be spoiled, bratty, and a little whiny.,
Show off and brag about everything you have.,
In the books, Mackenzie often says things like ""OMG"" and ""hon"".",How to Be Like MacKenzie Hollister from Dork Diaries6," Mackenzie would make a big deal if she broke a nail. However, if you're too dramatic, people will begin to think you're a loon. You can be dramatic, but if you're too dramatic, who knows what might happen?


In Dork Diaries Book One, Mackenzie made a big fuss when she got a bruise on her leg.

, But if you overdo it, it gets very annoying. This should happen only on rare occasions.

, Talk about yourself a lot, but not too much unless you want to be very bratty. However, people might think you're too self-centered, so don't talk about yourself all the time, or else people won't like you as much. Avoid being selfish.

, You can copy this if you want to, but some people may find it annoying. Mackenzie is known for giving ruthless insults to people. It is not recommended that you do this, but if you choose to, be very careful.

Smile!",How to Be Like Isabelle Lightwood from Mortal Instruments," Isabelle is incredibly confident and she knows what she is doing, and that is what makes her seem so cool to those who think she is cool. For a detailed look at that topic, check out How to Be Confident. It doesn't really matter how you increase your confidence to emulate Isabelle Lightwood, you just have to be confident or at least appear to be confident. Remember Isabelle is a fictional character so nothing unexpected can happen to her, she can be prepared for any situation just by saying she is. As an observer of a fictional story, we believe what the character's tell us. If a Isabelle needs to pick a lock, she is confident she can do so because she's made up. We believe she knows how to do anything she says she can do. If you want to be confident you can do anything you set your mind to do, learn how to do it. Being prepared to do something is the only way to be confident you can do it.


To aid your self confidence, you must be sure of yourself. Write affirmations you can repeat to yourself, dress how you want, and put out an air that says ""I'm comfortable with myself.""
Walk with a confident stride. When you want to show others how confident you are, you generally develop the confidence to go along with it. So hold your head high!;
, Just because you aren't the most graceful person now doesn't mean you can't be. Do exercises to help with this, such as working on your balance.

, Isabelle is one strong female, and you can be just as strong. Don't let people get you down, just remember to have confidence! Nothing and no one can get you down without your consent. ""Strong"" can be emotionally or physically, or both, it is up to you.

, Do what is comfortable for you, but remember that Isabelle is no plain jeans and tees kin of girl. Develop your own sense of fashion, whether it's based off of Isabelle herself, or the internet or magazines. Explore and have fun!

, The more you find out about her character, the fictional world she lives in, the author of the stories and even the actress who portrays her on screen the better your understanding of her will be and the more equipped you will be to understand her strengths and incorporate them into your own behaviour.

, Isabelle knows how to charm, and smiling is the number one rule in charm.

There are 5 books in the Percy Jackson and The Olympians (PJO) Series, and 5 books in the Heroes of Olympus (HoO) series. You should also read the Demigod Files, The Demigod Diaries, Kane crossovers: The Son of Sobek, The Staff of Serapis, The Crown of Ptolemy, extra books: Percy Jackson's Greek Gods, Percy Jackson's Greek Heroes & Percy Jackson: The ultimate guide.

, This is Uncle Rick's official Twitter account, and you can get important information here. You can also follow him on Facebook and Instagram, but those aren't as important as Twitter.

, Fanfiction is really fun. You can meet other fangirls and read stories to tide you over until the next book. You could also join Deviantart (original fan art), or any other Percy Jackson related websites. 

, There are lots of really cool Percy Jackson related blogs, and you can meet other fans.

, Fangirls use a lot of weird words:Ship- To ship someone is to think they have a good relationship or would be good together. A ship name is the two people's names put together. Example: I totally ship Percabeth! OTP stands One true pair. The couple you ship most of all. You can have more than one OTP. Cannon- Cannon is what actually happened in the books, the real facts not fanfiction. If a ship is canon, that couple actually exists in the book.These are just a few of the crazy words fangirls say. You should also start saying things like ""Oh my gods!"" and ""Holy Hades!"" Make sure you don't go too weird though. And of course make references to the books.

, You can have more than one, but most people only have one or two. Some common ships are Percabeth (Percy and Annabeth), Frazel (Frank and Hazel), Jiper (Jason and Piper), Caleo (Calypso and Leo). You can ship anyone you want. Your ship does not have to actually exist in the book.

Flirt a little.",How to Emulate Ashley Spencer," Ashley has a well-stocked wardrobe and body features any Vogue models would envy. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables and only have the occasional chocolate behind your friend's backs. Give people the impression that your diet is organic, even if it's not. Keeping in form is a must. Do a sophisticated sport like tennis or pilates to hush those thunder thighs.;
, Golden blonde hair is not a must, but it is preferred. Try a temporary dye at home to see if it looks good on you. Always use a good-quality shampoo and conditioner. Suggestions include Bumble & Bumble, Redken, or, if you can't afford any expensive hair products, Clairol.

, You've probably heard this many times, but hygiene IS important. Brush your teeth with a whitening paste twice a day, and use an electric toothbrush for better results. Use mouth wash and floss, and get braces if you need them. If you do get braces, make sure you get them in a chic colour, like silver or lavender. Never have yellow/stained teeth. Carry a pocket mirror around with you and check your teeth after eating meals. Always wash your face every night with a good scrub, toner and moisturiser. Some people use Clinique or Clarins. Use an acne scrub if needed. Use deodorant and a perfume of your choice. Nice perfumes include Daisy by Marc Jacobs, Dior Miss Cherie and any Britney Spears perfumes. Always have beautiful makeup. Glossed lips, rosy cheeks and long eye lashes are the look you should aim for. Use makeup brands like MAC, Clinique and Estee Lauder. Buy blushes and glosses that suit your skin tone. Avoid wearing bright lipstick with bright eye shadow. You can have a dramatic eye OR a bold lip, but NEVER both! It just looks clownish, and queen bees can never be clowns. Fact.

, Keep it fresh, clean and organized. You should own at least 5 pairs of jeans in different colours and styles, at least 10 different shirts, and at least 5 skirts in different lengths and styles. Never be caught dead in tacky clothes! Juicy Couture sweat suits come in handy, too. When you get home from school/shopping, change into some Juicy sweats. These are comfortable yet stylish. Have at least two pairs. Have a few designer items in your closet too, like GUESS, Hollister, Coach, basically any of the popular brands. Remember: As long as what you're wearing looks expensive & chic, that's all that matters. It doesn't matter if your high heels are Dior or Target - it only matters how you wear them and whether or not they are in. DO NOT be caught in anything featured in last season's Vogue. If your school has a uniform, customize it with cute socks, hair accessories and bags.

, Convince your parents to renovate it if it isn't quite luxurious at the moment. A nice house is important for when guests stay. Make sure your bedroom is alpha-worthy. Is it nicely decorated? Does it have modern technology 'extras'? Does it have a nice atmosphere? Leave a few scented candles in your bedroom and it'll smell great in no time. Display your shoes and purses for a boutique vibe, and add a mannequin for serious glamour. Have all the latest electronics such as a huge TV, a DVD player, a CD player and not to mention your own iPod and phone. DO NOT have a crummy phone. Get something like the iPhone or HTC Desire. Get your electronics covered in Swarovski crystals for an added touch of glamour.

, Save up for one over Christmas or your birthday. Recommendations include Guess, Juicy Couture, Coach, and if you're willing to go the extra mile, D&G or Chanel. Fill it with cute things - You never know who will go through your bag! Carry around the following: Your phone, your Kindle (If you have one), your iPod, at least two tubes of lipgloss, some mascara, an emergency sachet of foundation, a mini bottle of perfume for touch-ups, an agenda (Fill it with parties so anyone snooping thinks you're Uber popular), some pens, bobby pins, and, of course, your wallet!

, These aren't required, but they will gain you extra alpha-credit. Have gorgeous photos of yourself on facebook. Show those losers at school that you know how to work the camera! Do beauty tutorials on Youtube like Juicystar07. Get famous for it! Try to get yourself in a magazine or something, that way people will envy you HEAPS.

, Take yourself to the beauty salon every now and then, or get a subscription to a hot magazine, like DOLLY or Vogue or Seventeen. Never let your confidence levels drop! If you need a confidence recharge, type up exactly 100 reasons why you rule. Vain sounding, I know, but it works!

, Stand up for yourself when people are being total bitches. Have loads of good insults, such as: ""I would slap you, but that would be animal cruelty"" or ""Learn from your parents mistakes. Use birth control"" or ""Yeah, I've seen people like you before, but I had to pay an admission fee"". Crush anyone that gets in your way. If someone says something rude to you, make them miserable. Get everyone on your side and make THEM be the one to apologise. Never openly attack someone, though. Only the commoners do that.

, Your clique should consist of 2-4 other girls. They must be loyal, stylish and popular. Forming a group of losers is un-acceptable. Take your clique to the mall, give them makeovers and be the alpha. Have slumber parties with them every Friday night or so. Paint each other's nails and gossip all night. Provide amazing snacks and make it a time to remember. Have a set of clothing rules that are easy to follow, and create a few stickers saying, 'S.O.A.', which stands for 'Seal Of Approval'. Give them to all of the cool girls in your school, but don't tell them what it stands for. Keep them guessing! Give your clique a cool name, too, like 'The Coutures'. And NEVER let anyone else join.

, Make sure your birthday parties are always fantastic, and have them really exclusive. Only give 15 invites out to all of the S.O.A.'s in your grade. Hand the invitations out in an in-your-face sort of attitude.

, Keep mommy proud. Always put on an innocent act when you're around with your parents. That way, they think you're just a kind, popular girl. Which you are, right?

, Something cute like a kitten, pug or mini pig. Dress it up in cute collars and give it a sweet name like Chanel, Lulu or Teddy. Spoil them rotten!

, Make boys fall head-over-heels for you. Have a boyfriend, if possible. This will boost your ranking.

Decide why you want to be like Tris.,
Conquer your fear of heights if you have one.,
Learn how to fight, and stay in shape.,
Be careful when it comes to guys.,
Maintain good posture.,
Show curiosity from time to time.,
Try to feel what she feels.,
Wear colors like black, blue, and green.,
Stay calm.,
Make your room look like a Dauntless hideout.,
Organize a group of people to act like the other characters in the Divergent series.",How to Act Like Tris from Divergent," If you are trying to become her instead of you, then by all means abandon this article. But if you view her as a role model and want to adapt some of her personality traits into yours, then this article might just be for you.;
, In both the book and the movie, you can see that Tris is involved with heights a lot. She can jump out of trains and off the tops of buildings. She also climbed to the top of a Ferris wheel without falling. If heights only freak you out, but aren't a phobia, practice rock climbing or anything else that involves being up high without hurting yourself. If it is a phobia, start with small things like a balcony, a roof, or a roller coaster and work your way up to activities like rock-climbing.

, If you don't know self defense already, take a class such as karate, kung-fu, or taekwondo and work your way up to a black belt. Eat healthily too and drink lots of water. For days you don't have practice, set aside twenty minutes to practice at home. Before you start, warm up with running, pushups, and situps. If you really want to, you can join a gym and use the equipment there too. Don't worry about your weight, because the point is to train to become stronger if you ever need to defend yourself. Make your exercise schedule reasonable for you, but try to push yourself only a little bit past your limits.

, Tris' seventh fear is that Tobias only wants her for her body. Be sure that any guy you like makes eye contact when you talk to him. If he looks any lower than your head more than 25% of the time, the best thing you should do is either confront him or ditch him depending on how well you know him. If you're dating a guy who wants to always make out and doesn't seem to need anything more than that from you, then that's another sign he's not the one. Don't take this step too seriously, just try to be careful. Don't give him unlimited chances, just a few. A lot of guys can't help themselves so just try to figure out which factor of you he likes more: your body, or your personality.

, Tris always stands up straight, being as it will show that you're both brave and attractive. Practice sitting up straight. Check your posture each meal, each class, and each time you sit down in public. Not only that, but it'll help you and benefit you in the long run, whether you're trying to be like Tris or not.

, If a fact someone told you seems interesting, don't just think about it but get on the computer and do some research. Ask questions, ask questions, and ask questions some more. Also, don't be afraid to experiment with what you've learned, whether you're making a new type of smoothie, a making a new type of cookie, or registering to a new website.

, Love your family more than anything. Try not to hurt people too often, unless it's in self defense. Don't trust too easily, and don't be gullible. Also, keep your fears a secret. Give some thoughts to some of her quotes, and figure out what they resemble in your life. Examples of quotes to think about are, ""I am aware of how little space there is between us--six inches at most. That space feels charged with electricity. I feel like it should be smaller...""; ""It's easy to be brave when they're not my fears..."" and at the end of book one when she says, ""I am no longer Tris, the selfless, or Tris, the brave. I suppose that now, I must become more than either...""

, Don't buy designer clothes, and don't worry too much about what you wear each day, because you'll forget a week later. Wear stuff like oversized shirts, skinny jeans, combat boots, hoodies, leather pants, or a dress and high heels with some bracelets if you absolutely have to be fancy for an event or something.

, In difficult situations, don't cry, scream, or freak out. Just take a deep breath, close your eyes, and think of some solutions. If the situation involves others, run your plan by them before taking action. Everyone should agree, no matter who comes up with the plan.

, Dauntless is the faction Tris is part of. Paint it a color like black, red, or gray. Keep your lights off most of the time, and open your window as a source of light. If you can, make your curtains the same color as the wall. Whichever of the three colors you chose, get stuff like a rug, blankets, a chair, a beanbag, and pillows in that color. Make a poster to put on your door. It could be 'Dauntless Members Only', 'You Are Now Entering Dauntless', 'Dauntless', 'Knock Before Entering Dauntless', or 'Dauntless Rules' with your own bedroom rules underneath it. You could alternatively make your own phrase.

, Think about a job as a teacher or doctor, if you're a student take up a part time job as a librarian or at a bookshop.

Donate all your clothing you dislike to a charity.,

Always be kind and cheer people on.,
Never, or rarely, lie.,
Give yourself original, unheard-of nicknames.",How to Act Like Stargirl from Stargirl," Get rid of all your conservative clothing and make your own clothing, or buy clothing from thrift shops and be creative. Wear what makes you happy and what feels nice to wear, and try not to shop for brand names instead of what you actually like to wear. Being unique and in tune with yourself isn't about big brand names and designer labels!;
, Stargirl wears no makeup, she loves the outdoors and nature, and she doesn't really care about what she looks like, for the main part. Let go and just be yourself--don't give in to peer pressure, and never do anything that is against your personal values (not smoking, not drinking, not doing drugs, etc.).

, Stargirl would cheer for random strangers for doing things like throwing a candy bar wrapper away. Cheer for everyone and everything! Be random; extremely and wonderfully random! This doesn't mean that out of the blue, you should say things absolutely random words, which is just stupid. Say whatever comes to mind or what you want to talk about, not just what people want to hear. Stargirl is NOT stupid, just a bit dreamy, so be free and don't think what the rest of the world wants you to think just to make them happy.

, Be extremely nice to people, and be very aware of your surroundings. Read local newspapers, but like Stargirl does, skip the headlines and go to the seemingly insignificant 'filler' articles. Send cards and gifts to people when it is their birthday, leave coppers on the pavement for little kids to find and doodle away to your hearts content on paper, card and anything else you can get your hands on! Sing 'Happy Birthday' to people and cheerfully greet someone who looks upset.

, Stargirl has gone through several throughout her life, as she believes that a person can shed their name if it doesn't 'fit' anymore and take on a new one. Her birth name was Susan, which seemed too plain for her, so she shed it. A few names for herself were, Pocketmouse, Mudpie, and Hullygully. However, if you happen to like your name, or feel that it still fits, feel free to keep it. Nonconformity is all about doing what you like.


Some tips on how to give yourself a good nickname can be to go on a username creator. Type in things that remind you of you, and it comes up with all kinds of different names!

Save up some money.,
Ask her out.,
Bring a single rose to your date.,
Break the touch barrier.,
Listen.,
At the end of the date, give her a kiss on the cheek.,
Schedule another date.

,
Always be out to seduce your woman.",How to Be Like Casanunda," Shower every day. Whether you decide to go clean-shaven or wear a beard, make sure it's tidy. Wear a small amount of cologne and always make sure your clothes are clean and neat.;
, Basic etiquette rules: pull out her chair, and open the door for her. Say please, thank you, and you're welcome. Remember these rules at all times!

, Become a good flirt. Smile at girls and give them compliments; make them laugh. Break the touch barrier gently- a touch on the arm or shoulder. Flirt just enough to make them hope for something more.

, You want to target one specific woman at a time- you don't want to be labeled as a man-whore by messing around with multiple women. Women should also think that you're serious about them. Select a woman who you think is well-suited to you and has been responsive to your flirting.

, The process is more complex than one would believe. Buy her six or a dozen red, purple, or pink roses. Red roses symbolize passion, desire, and love. Pink roses symbolize poetic romance, and purple symbolizes eternal love (lighter shades of purple represent first love or love at first sight.) DON'T buy her yellow roses, which symbolize friendship, or black, which symbolize death. the number also matters: six is infatuation, a dozen shouts ""be mine!""

, This part is easy! Find out what she likes- white chocolate? Dark? Milk? Is she allergic to nuts? Coconut? Once you know, buy her a nice box of chocolates in a simple, not cheesy, box.

, DON'T deliver them to her house unless you have a legitimate, not-creepy reason to have her address (it was in the work directory, you went there once for a party, etc.) Include a small, sweet note: ""I was thinking of you. From, your secret admirer."" ""I'm falling for you. Signed, your name.""

, This is in preparation for the big date. Save up some money for an expensive restaurant or a date to a drive-in movie and coffee after.

, Don't be clumsy about it. Avoid tripping over your words, stammering over her name- you want to look very confident. Practice saying it aloud a couple times. Go up to her at a time when she isn't busy and the environment is quiet. Ease up to it: ""I heard you talking about that bistro earlier. I happen to know another really good bistro. Do you want to get dinner there sometime?"" is better than ""Wanna go out to dinner with me?"" Great lovers do NOT ask women out to coffee for the first date.

, A single rose says, ""I'm infatuated with you.""

, Play a little footsie under the table; hold her hand on the arm between the theater seats. Brush her hair away from her face- that kills women like you would not believe.

, Lean in; act like you're drinking in every word she says. She'll love the attention.

, If it feels right, move onto the lips.

,, Be madly flirtatious, lavish her with gifts, respect her, and treat her like she's heaven on earth. She'll LOVE it.

Convince everyone to call you either 'Dr.,
Now, if your school has a uniform, wear it dead perfect.,
Work on your grades.,
Carry around a small make-up-mirror-sized mirror, and glue in a picture of Hyde.,
Be dead serious, all the time.,
Now, work on HYDE.,
Replace the image of Hyde with one of Jekyll.

,
Again, argue with it, but ruder, and less often.

,
People are scum, remember - you're above them!

,
Have explosive anger!

,
When you are Jekyll again, go around and apologise to everyone!

,
In arguments (This may or may not be useful) follow these ideas:


Jekyll: Stand up for yourself, but if someone brings up something to do with 'Hyde', (e.g.",How to Act Like Dr. Jekyll in School," Jekyll', 'Jekyll', or 'Henry'. Henry is only for close friends, others may call you 'Jekyll' or 'Dr. Jekyll'. Make it clear that close friends can call you any of the three.;
, If a skirt has to be a certain length, do it. If you need a tie to be a number of stripes, yes, DO IT. If you don't have a uniform, wear a white blouse, black trousers, a black waistcoat, and, if you can, a Victorian style black jacket. Or, just look neat and smart.

, You will need good grades - Jekyll is, after all, a doctor/scientist! It is important to at least act as if you like science. Find out random scientific facts, and also case studies of people with dissociative identity  disorder ! Occasionally (about four - twenty times a week), tell people one of the facts. If they ask 'how did you know that?' or similar. act confused: 'Why, (insert name), I thought you knew I got my university degree! I needed to learn it!'

, Every now and then (about two - ten times a week) argue with 'Hyde' while look at the mirror. Or snap a comment at it. Here are some ideas:


Just shut up! I won't be tricked again!
No! I just want a moment without you taunting me!
It's all your fault that you're wanted for murder! I had nothing to do with it!
What? Why? Why did you... WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO?!? Excuse me... (leave)
(After turning back into Jekyll) Ok, where did you put my (pencil, maths book, ruler, etc.)
Look, people are staring... just be quiet... please?
I am not weak!
At least I have friends...you do need friends!...yes, I get by with a little help from my friends!
(When a friend comes by)Look, all I want is-oh, hi, uh... just a minute, (back to mirror) calm down, ok? You're making me stressed.

, It may seem boring, but wait for the next step! Well, not ALL the time, but, well, I hope you know what I mean, A scientist/Doctor doesn't USUALLY go running around like a lunatic (unless they ARE a lunatic...)

, Hyde is important. Why? Well, he drives Jekyll insane, so act insane, grouchy, even mean. Just don't go too far.

,,,,,, ""Just yesterday you called me a (weirdo, idiot)""), respond, nervously, but as if you are genuinely sorry, and didn't mean to (which, of course, you didn't) such as, ""I...I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean it offensively...I-It was meant to be...a nickname. Not mean, or, or anything!"" Argue your case, but if you think you're losing, just sigh, apologise for wasting their time, and leave, muttering comments like 'Oh, shut up' or 'You go and argue then, go on', (after saying that one, try 'exactly, so shut up and be quiet).
Hyde: Argue until you win. If need be, make things up (a few WHITE LIES ONLY won't hurt...) and point out truths which may embarrass people, just don't go overboard. Shout if you really want to, and tell them exactly what you think (unless it's rude and you'd get into personal or non-personal trouble) Just be careful about what you say.

Read the books of Harriet the Spy.,
Watch the movie.,
Write down notes from the movie and the books that might help you on your way.,

Use the notebook to write down the things you see when spying.,

Use a toy to distract people.,
Have a telescope than you can carry in your pocket to see better.,
Wear gloves.,
Carry a flashlight.,
Have good shoes that have good fitting, in case you'll need to run.,
Bring dog bones, if possible.,
Never get caught.",How to Pretend to be Harriet the Spy," If you read them, you'll know how to write notes down when spying. Also, go to your library and check out other books that might help you on how to be a great spy!;
, There is only one movie, which is called, ""Harriet the Spy,"" and it is in movie style of one of the books. You learn about the things she does, and you can get a good glimpse of the spy gadgets Harriet wears on her spy belt!

, What is important to you will help you more than someone else telling you how to do something! You can then study how the spy acts and does things. This will help you become better.

, Don't wear a dress or skirt. You'll just ruin it, and look weird when spying. No frilly clothes or shiny jewelry, or regular jewelry, because it can make noise, and if you have bright sliver and gold colors, the sun reflects, and it gives away your hiding and where you are.

, Harriet M. Welsh has a green composition notebook, but you can use any color or notebook (see below for ideas,). What kind of a notebook should you get? Not a very fancy one, and one that the paper doesn't come out, and that sticks. It also shouldn't have to be that fancy on the top. You could have a plain notebook with your favorite color on it and you can call it good.

, Then you can know what you found on that day, when spying. When you fill up your notebook, you might have enough information on some people to make a file on them. Just don't let anyone see your notebook.

, Having a gadget belt is great to have! Why? It carries your things in a manner that no one will notice. But having an oversize coat that covers your gadget belt would be great, because people won't suspect there is your spy notebook and gadgets underneath your oversize coat.

, That way, you can see around corners without peaking your head, so nobody knows that your still there.

, Pencils are more recommend, because ink can squirt out, and wash from rain, but Pencils can have the led come out, and ink used up from pens. That's why you should keep a set of them in your gadget belt.

, A yo-yo or some kind of distracting toy, to distract other people to think your doing something else when you're actually spying. This is recommend, for Harriet M. (M stands for middle name) Welsh has it, and if you watch the movie, she uses a ping pong paddle toy, or similar one.

, Then you can see straight and clear ahead. Especially if your spying from a tree.

, You'll need them so you can climb trees and ropes, just like Harriet did in the movie. Then you won't be crying, or get hurt, because you'll be caught. Also, when climbing trees be careful not to fall. Learn how to climb like a pro, but with Safety First!

, Just in case you have to go in a dark street, or something. You might also use it to look at something with dim light.

, Then you won't stop and get blisters. Flip flops and high heel shoes are instantly off limits, and so are dressy shoes. Boots are okay, but loud, and hard to run in, because you might fall.

, Sometimes dog bones are great on hand for a barking dog that won't stop barking. A dog that barks non stop, is like an alarm, and will make people become suspicious, and your cover will be over.

, The number one rule. ""Good spies never get caught,"" ~ Harriet M. Welsh. Try not to get caught, or your spy career, might be just over with your notebook caught, and your identity that was secret.

, If you already have a pair, perfect! Jeans that are tight at the waist and flared at the leg are most popular in the movie 'Thirteen.' Jeans with studs, sparkles and grommets are perfect. If you want to jazz up the jeans you have, add some sequins or diamante studs to the pockets and legs.

, The girls in the movie wear lots of black Converse shoes. While the brand is not important, a pair of hightops is ideal. Feel free to add sparkled and studs to the shoes and to scrawl writing all over them!

, The girls in the movie are seen out in tight, navel baring black vests through much of the movie. These vests can be purchased at stores like Hot Topic.

, The girls are never seen without low slung, metallic belts. These belts can be bought at almost any teen clothing store. Black ones with silver grommets are most popular.

, Get a flashy bag that stands out. A silver, gold or black purse is ideal. Brands like Bebe and Guess make cute purses that are flashy and perfect for an urban scene!

, Silver chains, flashy cross necklaces and huge hoop earrings top the look off. Don't be afraid to over accessorize! Add flashy bangles, layers of thin and shiny necklaces and hoop earrings to any look. If you don't like jewelry at least buy a pair of hoop earrings as the girls in 'Thirteen' always have a pair on.

, If you don't feel comfortable doing so, you can skip this step. Nikki Reed and Evan Rachel Wood sport navel and tongue piercings in the movie.

Get studs with chains or flashy colors., The key for this look is over the top. Lots of eyeliner (black) and eyeshadow. It is important to buy some glitter to adorn your eyes and lashes with. Lise Watier makes a great sparkly black eyeliner. If you are going to wear lip gloss make sure it is pink or red. Use blush and bronzer to look sexy and healthy. Flawlessness is not the goal for this look; you want to look pretty but also tough and cool.

, If you don't already own a curler or straightening iron it would be good to buy these tools now. Curls and glamorous hair accessories are popular in the movie. If you feel comfortable, buy some hair extensions and hair pieces. Hot Topic sells extensions in a range of colors. Buy some shiny bows and hair clips and don't be afraid to tease your hair, curl it and make it look dramatic! In the movie, Evie often has relaxed and wavy hair but straightens her hair and adds hair pieces when she's going out. Tracy curls her hair and ties it up in dramatic buns when she is going out.

, G-strings are the most popular in the movie.

, Paint your nails mostly dark colors. You'll usually see the girls in black, purple or dark red nail polish.

Be loud and laugh with your friends in public. When you are out act tough and unafraid. Act intimidating and make other girls want to be you. Flirt with boys but act unavailable and never act desperate.

Change your attitude first.,
Develop the skills that Lyra has.,
Dress as Lyra would if she were in this world.,
Apply makeup sparingly.,
Keep your hair long.,
Get a daemon.,
Study the way she acts, note what she says in certain situations.",How to Act Like Lyra," Lyra is clever and canny. Learn as many things as you can and answer every question thrown at you. Don't think that Lyra is loud-mouthed, she is quite quiet but is a little louder around adults. Be cheeky, lie about things that you have done. Try to make people laugh, smile as much as possible but glare at people who are boring/annoying/insulting you. Be rebellious and do the opposite of what others ask of you. Don't follow orders that you don't see sense in.;
, She can read the alethiometer, so study symbols from the book and from other sources (of course, if you learn them off by heart then even better!). Remember that the alethiometer has a millions- or in fact infinitive- meaning. If you know all of them then perhaps consider getting a real alethiometer. Lyra lived at Jordan College for a very long time and was taught many things, while with Mrs Coulter so know a lot on subjects like science (particularly atoms and electrons), Greek mythology, history, and mathematics. Lyra knows how to sew, so practice sewing, embroidery, or knitting. Try reading books on a lot of facts (useless and can be used facts).

, Obviously it would be silly to run around in long brown dresses, aprons and furs. Instead, ask yourself what you think Lyra would wear. She's a tomboy, so comfortable clothing and not too decorative clothing is a good idea. Come up with new ideas and play around with styles until you find something you like. (In fact don't wear any makeup, unless you need to.) It is against Lyra's world for girls to wear trousers so try wearing skirts, dresses even better. If you hate dresses and skirts do not be afraid to wear what you think Lyra would wear if she was in this world.

, Lyra does experiment with makeup whilst living with Mrs. Coulter, but she wouldn't have time for it on an everyday basis, especially when rescuing Roger from Bolvangar! Keep your look natural. Wear brown eyeliner instead of black, apply blusher, blend light brown and lilac eyeshadow on your eyelid, and use a small amount of light pink or clear gloss. Use a foundation with moisturizer or sunscreen.

, It's best if your hair is naturally wavy or curly, but if it's not, curl it with an iron if you really want to. In the books, Lyra's hair is blonde, but in the movies, it's a brownish-reddish color. Of course it isn't really what you look like, it is more how you act that makes you like Lyra. But practice looking innocent and slightly rude and rebellious.

, Pantalaimon is Lyra's daemon, who takes the form of an ermine most often. However, you must be very careful about doing this. Don't buy a real pet and carry it around with you! Instead, either find a small stuffed animal you really like or make an imaginary daemon, and name it something exotic. The latter might be the best to opt for, as this type of daemon will seem much more real than a simple stuffed toy, and you can decide what animal it is! Remember the forms that Pantalaimon is, which are mainly: ermine, wildcat, moth, forms of birds, even a dragon and a lion!

, How she acts to what other people say, watch the film or read the books and write down things you could say in real life to similar situations.

Dress in clothes that you find comfortable, but when the situation calls for it, it's important to show people that you can look fashion-forward if you try!,
Have a cap.,
Be natural.,
Try to read as much as you can.,
Try to excel at athletics.,
Learn about architecture.,
Stay informed.,
Don't forget Annabeth's gift of combat.,

Be confident.,
Think outside the box.,
Take pride in yourself, maybe even a little too much pride.,
Fear spiders.,
Be brave.,
Be good at sports.",How to Act Like Annabeth Chase from Percy Jackson," For example, Annabeth might wear things like:


Loose T-shirts
Camp Half-blood T-shirt
Solid colored, layered, tank tops in colors such as white, black, gray, orange, or blues.
Jeans or Jean shorts
Converse, sneakers
Running/jogging shoes
Solid coloured flip-flops
Small silver owl earrings (those given to her by her father)
No jewellery at all except for her bead necklace and her silver owl earrings.
A bead necklace (the one she wears from Camp Half-Blood)
Hair in a ponytail or possibly in a braid
Hair down and curly.;
, If you want to go all out in being authentic, keep a navy New York Yankees cap in your pocket or carry it around with you. And if you get a pocket knife, look for a bronze or gold-colored one. For Heroes of Olympus, you could get an Athenian coin.


This applies unless you are trying to act like her in Heroes of Olympus, when the Yankees Cap loses its powers.

, Annabeth is very down-to-earth, she doesn't wear makeup, and looks don't matter very much to her. But, you should still take care of yourself! Annabeth is a very hygienic and clean person and was described by Percy in the fourth book as ""smelling like lemons"" so you can use lemon scented products if you want. And she easily took the opportunity in Water World to take fresh clothing from the gift shop (in the first book), so this shows she is a very clean person.


If you don't have blonde hair and gray eyes, you can use lemon juice while you suntan in your hair to lighten it up.
For the eyes, If you have a reflective eye color such as blue or hazel or light green, then wearing something that is gray or black near your face, it will make them look grayish. Or, if you already wear contacts for sight purposes, get gray colored ones, instead.


Just remember to be yourself, and don't get so caught up in imitating someone else that you lose sight of who you are.

, Although Annabeth has dyslexia, she is also a Daughter of Athena, and that means the more knowledge, the better! Some good reading lists are:


classics and other prestigious titles, such as: http://www.goodreads.com/list/show/6.Best_Books_of_the_20th_Century )
Greek mythology---a lot of it!

, Many people are not exactly athletically inclined; if you are, that's fantastic, but if not, it really doesn't matter all that much. If Annabeth were to play sports, she would probably excel in things such as:


Fencing
Archery
Rock climbing
Karate
Contact sports such as soccer, etc.
Be a strong swimmer.

, Annabeth is really into architecture; she's also the Architect of Olympus, after it's been ruined (Percy Jackson: The Last Olympian). If you also find this topic interesting, it might be a good idea to read up on how to be an architect, famous buildings, etc. Even better, why not visit them? If architecture is not your thing, find something you're good at and perfect it; any skill can be useful if you can do it well, and you don't have to be a daughter of Athena to excel at something! One of Annabeth's most prized possessions is a laptop full of ideas and inventions that her half-sibling, Daedalus, gave her. If you admire someone's work, don't be afraid to use their style as a foundation while you develop your own. Just make sure you don't copy anyone!


If architecture is not your thing, find a different passion. No matter if it's acting, sketching or basketball; stick to it and always be interested and excited to do it. Don't force yourself to like something, you don't actually want to do. Find a hobby that you love to do and don't care what others think of it!







, Annabeth would watch informational television programs. On channels such as National Geographic channel, Military channel, History channel, biography channel, or the science channel.

, You probably don't own a sword and truthfully that's good. But, instead have fast reflexes. You might not use them in battles, but since Annabeth's mother is Athena, goddess of war strategy and wisdom, she is fast and agile., Annabeth is really smart and does a lot of planning. Feel free to carry a planner around with you at school or wherever you go in case you think of a great idea to jot down. Annabeth uses a lot of big words that the average person doesn't understand. Flip through a dictionary and work on increasing your vocabulary and using big words on a daily basis.

, Confidence is very important, and Annabeth was seen as slightly pompous at first impression but turns out to have lots of depth and be a really sweet person. She isn't afraid to be herself and stand up for what she believes in. Also, don't be afraid to use intelligent sarcasm. Never be afraid to show your true self, just like Annabeth.


Be both smart and confident. If you're already smart, great! Get outside, do some sport, meet up with friends. To achieve great confidence, stand in front of the mirror and list up the things that you like about yourself. Ignore the small imperfections. Get off the cell phone or any other device. If you don't feel like going outside all the time, read a book! Annabeth is a huge book nerd, since she is the daughter of Athena.







, Annabeth never seems to go with the obvious answer to things; she comes up with wiser, more creative solutions. Take the time in the Mark of Athena when Annabeth is trapped in a cavern and forced to choose death by fire or dagger. Unlike many children of Athena before her, she chooses neither. Instead, she creates a trial of her own.

, Annabeth's fatal flaw is hubris, or deadly pride. She believes that she can do anything, even run the world, better than others.

, If you want to act like any child of Athena, you've got to hate spiders. If you know the legend of Arachne (the woman who challenged Athena to a weaving contest and was then turned into the first spider), you'll know why.

, Annabeth is known for her wisdom and her courage.


Be cautious as well as brave. Annabeth is both cautious and brave. When you first meet her, she might be a little weird to be around, but when you get to know her, she's actually a really sweet and caring person. You can achieve this, by not immediately trusting anyone with your deepest secrets or with your friendship. Take small steps and if the person begins to get used to you and warms up to you, then you might have just earned a new friend!







, You may not be the most sport person out there, but don't forget that you're not the only one. Annabeth is extremely sporty, which also leads to a good body, which leads to confidence. So you're kind of supporting three positive things, by doing only one thing. If you don't like to go running, try something else. Maybe your thing is rock climbing. Or maybe it's yoga. You won't know unless you try it out. You don't even have to be a huge sports fanatic, you can just do some simple exercises, maybe take your dog for a walk now and then. Take small steps, and one day, fitness will just be another thing in your everyday routine.

Piercings are quite popular among the Dauntless as well, but make sure if you're a minor that you have permission from parents before getting any piercings. If you are afraid or uncomfortable  with piercings, you can always get ones that are fake and non-body piercing.

, This is very crucial. Just wearing black, chains and tattoos don't make you Dauntless. Achieve self confidence. Walk confident and careless. It makes you noticeable.

, Most of the Dauntless are confident in themselves, and they don't talk themselves down.  The members may have their issues with themselves, but they don't tell people because it causes a negative environment, and Dauntless is quite a positive one. If you're the kind of person who typically talks themself down, try and stop, because that only makes yourself less confident and brings your self-esteem down.


Surround yourself with people who bring you up. If you're hanging out with people who are constantly telling you all the negative things about yourself, stop hanging out with them. Make new friends that tell you the truth when you need it, but don't tell you all of the negative things about yourself. This really helps bring your confidence level up.

, Since Dauntless is the warrior faction, they're tasked with defending and fighting. This means that everyone in Dauntless is physically fit.


Make your own workout routine that fits to your body needs. Don't look up some hard workout that works your arms when you already have strong and muscular arms. Work the weakest parts of your body to help them become stronger.
Take a self-defense class. During Dauntless initiation, the initiates go through a whole stage of learning to fight. Take up a taekwondo class, and start boxing. Anything related to helping defend yourself will be worth it.

, The whole second stage of Dauntless is finding out your fears and overcoming them. If you don't know what your fears are, think of all the things you've been afraid of and write them down. If you're afraid of the dark, sit in a dark room for an hour without any flashlights. If you're afraid of heights, try climbing a tree, then go on the roof of a house, then maybe try a roller coaster that doesn't go to high. It's all about facing your fears, and knowing how to quell them.

, The thing the Dauntless do the most is I've there lives how they want to, not how someone else is or wants them to. They do the things they love and they're loud and don't hold back when they're having fun. Don't try to be like a specific person and copy everything that they do, because that's them, and not you. Don't limit yourself and try your hardest at things, because being happy is the best thing you can be."

Hair--Sienna's hair is healthy, shiny, and gorgeous.,
Makeup--First of all, keep your skin looking fresh and soft by washing every day with a cleanser and putting on skin lotion.,
Style--Sienna's style is very unique because she mixes and matches high-end designer pieces with vintage thrift-store finds.,
Personality--In most pics you see of her, Sienna is smiling brightly and sweetly--and genuinely.",How to Look Like Sienna Miller," You can get your own hair to look this way by using products like moisturizing shampoo/conditioner. Sienna usually goes for a natural look, so try not to use too many products, but if you want to then try an anti-frizz/shine serum; it will make your hair look sleek and beautiful. Sienna does have blonde hair, but that doesn't mean you have to dye your hair if you're not a blonde! Keep in mind that Sienna also tends to change her hairdo quite a bit--long and wavy one week, short and cropped the next. If you're not quite as daring, that's no problem--just experiment with different hairstyles that don't require a trip to the salon (Ex: ponytails, braids, buns, curled hair, straightened hair...);
, If you need it, use concealer or foundation, but it's better to have a natural look, so try to keep your skin healthy without cover up makeup. As for the makeup you should wear, be sure to keep it nice and simple--Sienna is very beautiful and she uses makeup to enhance her natural features, not cover them up. Try: black mascara (or dark brown for a less dramatic look), a peach-colored cream blush that goes with your skin tone, and a shiny lip gloss that matches the blush somewhat. If you want to, add shimmery nude eyeshadow...and to make this look more dramatic for a special occasion, add lightly smudged black or charcoal gray eyeliner or a darker lip color (like fuchsia or red)...but never do this both at once!!

, It's OK if you can't afford designer clothes, though (honestly, who can??)--just go to the stores you usually shop at (Ex; Kohls, Target, Abercrombie, Wet Seal...). Then, go to a thrift store (Goodwill, Salvation Army, to name a couple) and pick out some funky vintage clothes...it will all be really cheap! Mix and match your thrift store finds with your more contemporary clothes for an awesome unique look! Ooh, and don't forget your accessories: Sienna is rarely seen without a beaded necklace, a colorful scarf, or funky metallic boots. For accessories, it's okay to go all vintage since they're just the little bits that complete an outfit...it would be too much to be in head-to-toe vintage clothing!...but for accessories it looks funky and unique. Remember to choose colorful pieces to complement your outfits; Sienna sometimes tends to wear a lot of neutral colors like black, brown, white, gray, etc., and she uses brightly colored accessories as great accent pieces.

, Never one to be fake or obnoxious, Sienna is one those celebrities who earns millions of fans by being kind and real. To come off this way to others, smile and laugh a lot, but make sure to always be very genuine about it. Always be polite and treat others with kindness and respect. That being said, don't be afraid to have a sense of humor! Sienna often makes humorous comments when being interviewed, and it just makes people love her that much more. Plus, cracking a joke gives you a chance to use that laugh of yours! If you follow these tips, you'll be beautiful both inside and out--just like Sienna Miller!

Get lots of sleep.,
Don't overdo the drama.,
Don't act up.,
Remember: being Beezus is hard work.",How to Act Like Beezus Quimby," No-one likes a silly-head. Don't mess around in class; the teachers will love you and you'll get a whole lot more work done.;
, It makes life a whole lot easier in the long run; you'll know where everything is and what you've done to it. Don't leave your homework to the morning before; you'll be rushed and get the answers wrong. Always spend an hour on your homework, even if you finish it in ten minutes. It will be complete and beautiful, and even if you get some of the answers wrong the teacher won't mind because it contains lots of effort.

, Nobody likes a meanie-pants. You don't have to smile and simper at everybody, just the occasional 'hello' or a nice smile can brighten up your day and someone else's.

, Every teacher will love you if you really try your best. Practice or study before exams or even normal lessons, if you've had to skip out on a lesson because you had a music lesson or you were sick, always find the teacher before the next lesson to ask for the work that you missed; its saves them a whole lot of time chasing you up about that essay or sum that you didn't complete, and it will make their life easier as well as yours.

, Get plenty of protein and fruit and vegetables, these can really boost your mood in the right quantities. Also, exercise helps with your mood control, so get plenty of it and you'll be fresh and awake for ages!

, Sleep is golden when you are growing, it helps to stimulate your brain and helps you to grow. Drink a glass of milk before you brush your teeth in the evenings, it'll really help you drift off.

, It's okay to get frustrated sometimes. Beezus is a drama queen, so it's fine to feel like a volcano occasionally. But just don't explode like one. It's better to just walk away from that mean girl at school, or it's better to do what your mom says instead of throwing a tantrum.

, Beezus Quimby is polite and well behaved. She isn't rude or sulky in public, so try to be the same. If you feel really annoyed with someone, just straighten your back and smile, and excuse yourself before you make a rude comment.

, You have a million things to think about; so when you feel like you're about to faint, take a deep breath and plaster a smile on your face, you'll feel so much more pleased with yourself, and you'll be in a better mood!

, Ask your parents if you could lease a horse or buy one. However, this may not be realistic for some. If you already have one great.

, Show Jumping, Dressage, Cross Country (Eventing) (optional). If you want the blue ribbons like the CanterWood Crest girls this is a must.

, Sasha, Heather, Alison, Callie and Julia have to keep their grades up to be on the team. Always have school come first then horses. If you need help ask the teacher or friends. Maybe even a tutor, whatever it takes.

, Whatever flavor you want, you could order online or at your local store. Target has a good selection. When it comes to business the Canterwood Crest Girls always have their game face on, and lip gloss.

, You don't have to blow a bunch of money like Heather. Go to a used clothing store, or swap your old clothing with a friend.

And remember, being a Billings girl is about strength, determination, loyalty, and courage.",How to Act and Look Like a Billings Girl," Being a Billings Girl is definitely way more than just appearance.. but it does in fact play a huge role in it. If you're going to be representing Billings, we want you looking your best.;
, We don't want zits all over your face! No one wants to look like or be the girl with the pizza face. If you have naturally beautiful skin, than you're lucky, but still make sure to keep good hygiene and wash your face. However, if you're like 95% of the girls in high school, you're going to want to invest in some products.

, Straightening, curling, scrunching, whatever you want. Just make sure you look presentable. At all times. You never know what important billionaire you might run into next. Also, we're not going to want some frizzy afro girl representing the Billings name. Use frizz-preventing shampoo, conditioner, and products. And another thing, you don't want dull hair color... no one does. Try going to the salon and getting low-lights or high-lights, and make sure you don't have any dead/split ends. Gross. Get a nice cut that will compliment your face frame.

, Even though every girl is naturally beautiful, the whole point of make up, is to simply enhance one's features. Not paint a new face on. Try some mascara, eyeliner, eyeshadow, and skin makeup. Google ways to play up the color of your eyes, and how to properly apply eyeliner. Remember with skin make up, to use primer, foundation, and cover up. It might sound like a lot, but it isn't. It all depends on how you apply it. Don't cake it on, distribute is evenly across your face in the right places, to make it look like you have naturally, beautiful, blemish-free skin.

, Probably the most important key thing to any Billings girl's reputation. If you have money, you probably don't need much help in this department. However, if you're middle class like the rest of us, there's no need to dress like it girls! There are plenty of designer brands that are cheap and cute. Stores like Charlotte Russe, Forever 21, Hollister, American Eagle, Aerie, and Abercrombie are places you can get Billings approved clothes for a decent price.

, Let's get one thing straight, Billings Girls know what they want, and they always get what they want. Why? Well, being popular rich and pretty obviously plays a part.. However, the way they present themselves plays a HUGE role. You must present yourself as confident, cool, calm, and collected. Billings girls are level-headed about everything.

, Billings girls know everything about everyone, so make sure you do too. When big news hits your school, do you want to be the last to know? Absolutely not. You wanna be the one spreading it... (or keeping it a secret.)

, Considering you're looking to be the girl everyone else wants to be, you're going to want to be well rounded. When you see that pretty girl, who's athletic, and gets perfect grades, don't you wish you could have all that? Exactly. So be that girl. Don't wish you were her. (Hint: This doesn't come easy to anyone. You're going to have to work your ass off for this. But if you can't live up to it, then you're just not Billings girl material...)

, No matter what. Mistakes they've made, secrets they have, you're going to want to stand by them no matter what, through thick and thin, and protect them, and the Billings name.

, Good luck!

Watch a lot of South Park episodes.,
Watch Trey Parker demonstrations.,
Understand his accent.,
Listen carefully to the voice.,
Hone in on the pitch.,
Memorize popular phrases.,
Pick your favorite.,
Practice, practice, practice!,
Get into character.,
Develop comedic timing.,
Keep nothing off limits.",How to Talk Like Cartman from South Park," You’ll need to do this to truly understand his voice and his character in general. Make note of the subtleties and nuances in his voice. Note the type of words he uses, phrases he says often and how he relates to others., Who better to learn how to mimic Cartman’s voice, than from the voice actor himself? Replay his videos a lot.


Observe how he holds his mouth, how his jaw is positioned, how his tongue stays flat when saying most words, etc., Cartman has a slight lisp and tends to jumble letters together. Instead of saying, “Cool!” and pronouncing all the letters in the word, Cartman says, “Ku!” He also tends to speak from behind his teeth. For example, when saying the word “tomorrow,” he pronounces it, “Tuh-muh-ruh.”


He’s a loud talker and often sounds like he’s yelling at everyone, even during normal conversations.

, Remember, Cartman is still a kid who hasn't gone through puberty so his voice is really high. He also sounds super nasally which is a distinct sound. Notice as well that when he speaks it almost sounds like he has marbles in his mouth.


Practice by squeezing your nostrils closed to imitate the voice.
Notice the squeakiness in his voice too. This is especially noticeable when he’s crying.

, The pitch is the noise created based on the rate of vibration of the vocal folds. The sound of the voice changes as the rate of vibrations varies. Meaning, if you want your voice to sound higher pitched like Cartman's, you will need to train your vocal cords to tighten and/or relax, depending on your natural sound.


Computer software can be used to manipulate your voice as well. While Trey Parker does a great job on his own creating the iconic sound, his voice is further altered by technology to produce an even more extreme pitch., Cartman has several go-to phrases he uses over and over again. To truly mimic the character, learn some of these in his accent. Among the ones you should work on first is: ""Respect my authority,” which he pronounces “Rus-pec muh uh-thor-a-tie.""


Another popular one to try would be, “Screw you guys...I'm going home!” He typically pronounces this like, “Skruh yuh guys… ahm guin’ hum!”, As a Cartman fan, you probably have your own Cartman-ism that you love to hear. After watching dozens of episodes, determine which ones you want to reproduce and go for it.


Choosing ones that are easily recognized as a Cartman phrase will help you win over your audience.
Consider creating a word or phrase that you may not have heard the character say but think it would be funny. Perhaps it’s something you say often but want your friends to hear it in the South Park’s character tone of voice. It will be hilarious!, You may not get it down on your first ten tries but it will come over time, and that’s part of the fun.


Find those who have mastered the Cartman voice and use their tips and tricks too., Part of Cartman’s appeal is his bratty attitude towards those around him. Create this persona by putting yourself in his shoes. Think about what he would say to a friend or someone he despises.


If you’re having difficulty, consider saying and/or doing the rudest, most inappropriate thing you can think of and you’re there!

, Cartman, perhaps unwittingly, has great rhythm and pace when dishing out some of his spot-on observations about life, current events and friends. You can learn this skill by not only watching him in action but also by observing other humorous personalities you enjoy.Note the pace and delivery of jokes. Cartman, like many comics, pauses before sharing the punchline. This tactic builds anticipation.
You can also try repeating things for added emphasis.
Speak slowly, allowing people to really hone in and focus on what you’re saying, then hit them with a witty Cartman zinger.

, If you really want to sound just like the beloved, animated character don’t hold back. Feel free to say exactly what’s on your mind, just like he does. If you notice, Cartman comments on race, religion, politics and everything in between!


Know your audience. Some may be offended by these antics and a bit peeved.

Learn the controls.,
Familiarize yourself with the map.,
Master the combat system.,
Study enemy model types.,
Use gadgets to your advantage.,
Upgrade wisely.,
Defeat Death stroke.,
Watch out for collectibles.,
Play the multiplayer mode.",How to Play Batman Arkham Origins," In order to beat the game, you should familiarize yourself with the game’s controls. Luckily, if you have played the game’s predecessors, you will have an easy time getting used to the controls since it is similar to the previous layout.


Regardless of your system, you can configure the controller's setup to your liking.;
, Without a doubt, this game is huge. You can easily get lost when you don’t pay attention to what the map indicates. The map is very important because it shows you the exact locations of places where you should go next.


The map is especially useful in completing game collectibles and side quests.

, The fluid combat system returns in Batman Arkham Origins, but this time, there’s a bit of twist. It’s not mere button mashing but instead, timing of the attacks is required to successfully land those deadly combos.


One of the most effective ways of attacking is to counterattack enemy attacks. Find each enemy’s vulnerable points in their attack flow and know when to strike when you see an opening.
Learning to continuously chain combo attacks can be enhanced by using your batarang and vault-dodge.
You can use the bat grapple to take down enemies easily. While they are dizzy, you can apply a melee attack on them to totally eliminate them. Just make sure these enemies are away from the group so you won’t get bombarded with enemies afterwards.
Sometimes it helps to use detective mode while in combat just to fully see your surroundings.
Predator takedowns in Batman Arkham Origins are better than ever before! Usually triggered by the triangle button, these takedowns are expanded and should help your stealth kills improve.

, Different types of enemies have different weaknesses. It will be helpful if you can identify which enemies you are dealing with so you can adjust your fighting style accordingly.


Certain enemies should be prioritized to be eliminated first such as enemies with weapons. Taking down these enemies will make it easier for you to eliminate regular enemies with combos even in groups.

, Batman’s gadgets are back in this game like the batarang, bat claw, and the explosive gel just to name a few. These gadgets are necessary to get pass through certain puzzles and some can be used to eliminate enemies.

, Like the previous Arkham games, Arkham Origins also allows you to upgrade you weapons and skills with experience points.


It is advisable to prioritize improving your melee skills and your health. These two aspects will be very important especially as you reach the game’s final parts.
Some of the skills that you might want to unlock are the ability to disarm enemies with shields and some stealth predator skills which are again, melee based.

, Defeating bosses in Batman Arkham Origins is really challenging. Among the most difficult ones is Deathstroke. He may be hard to beat at the beginning but with proper strategy – you will eventually win the encounter.


At the start of the battle, just keep on attacking him since at this point he won’t pull off any fancy moves on you just yet.
After a while you will have to wait for him to initiate attacks. When he does so, that’s the time you should counterattack! This is the most effective way of inflicting damage to Deathstroke at this point of the battle. Be sure to recognize if he’s already done attacking before executing your counterattack.
When Deathstroke finally uses his smoke bombs, you should mash the triangle button (or Y button on the Xbox). Remember, mash the button – not press.

, Arkham Origins offers collectible-hunting as bonus when trying to complete the game 100%. Some of the collectibles are really hard to find so better keep your eyes peeled as you explore this game’s vast locations.


There are four collectibles in Arkham Origins, namely Enigma Data packs, Anarchy Tags, Cyrus Pinkney Plaques, and Network Relays.
There are also a bunch of things that you can unlock upon completing challenges in Arkham Origins. Some of these are unlocking costumes, trophies (PS3), and achievements (Xbox).
Completing challenges such as Predator, Combat, and Combat Training challenges are some of the challenges that should be cleared in order to unlock trophies/achievements.

, Multiplayer is a brand new addition to the Arkham series. On this mode, two gangs battle it out for turf supremacy. You can apply what you have learned in playing the campaign mode when battling it out with other online players.


One good strategy to win online matches is to avoid being isolated. You should stick with your group especially if you are on the evil side of the match.
Chatting with your teammates can also help your team execute a solid plan on defeating your opponents.

Megan has stated that she adheres to a strictly raw, vegan diet. This means eating a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables, and staying mostly away from meat and animal by-products, like eggs and dairy. Megan will still eat some meat and non-vegan ingredients, but she eats them in strict moderation. Her health-conscious eating habits are a large part of why she's able to maintain such a good figure.


Most raw food diets include fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds, sprouts, root vegetables and squashes, fresh herbs and spices. Try working these foods into your diet as much as possible. If you're used to a meat-heavy diet, you may have to eat larger dishes than you're used to, but you should notice a major difference in the way you're feeling within a week. Megan stays away from processed foods, like potato chips and white bread. These 'empty snack' foods are notoriously low on proper nutrition, so it's recommended to replace these common snacks with healthier substitutes like almonds. Not only will this make you more like Megan, you'll most likely find you have far more energy than you used to!;
, Megan eats three meals a day, with two smaller snacks in between. Eating throughout the day gives your digestive system time to consume at a more even rate, ensuring you'll have consistent energy. The times and rate at which you eat are almost as important as what you eat, so evenly distributing your food throughout the day is an important part of achieving Megan's health.


For breakfast, Megan eats eggs. Usually she eats two egg whites with avocado. She also may have a smoothie for breakfast. If you follow this routine, make sure your smoothie has a variety of high-nutrient vegetables. As eggs are animal by-products, it is recommended you keep them as a secondary part of your breakfasts; this will keep your cholesterol low, and have you feeling your best for the day!
For lunch and dinner, Megan is big on salads, with a minor helping of meat, like grilled chicken. Her bigger meals revolve around sources of protein, fibre and healthy fat. For snacking, Megan is big on hummus and fresh vegetables. Nuts are also an important part of snacking; they are rich in protein, and easy to take along with your during the day. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to rid your body and skin of toxins. Health is a way of life for Megan, and her fine shape is a result of her daily routine.

, In order to look like Megan, you'll need to follow a pretty intense exercise schedule. She does one circuit 3 times a week for 60 minutes a day. She also has days where she works out for 2 hours.While Megan enjoys the help of an exercise trainer, you won't need professional help to approximate her regimen. Making stretching, and cardio-intensive exercises like running and dancing a regular part of your routine is an necessary step towards getting a toned, athletic physique. Setting an hour each morning to work out will be enough to see strong results quickly.


Megan does interval training, and this particular method has been shown to be most effective with weight loss and maintenance. Try alternating between a minute of intense exercise and a minute of rest. This will jumpstart your metabolism, allowing you to burn more calories throughout your day. Applying this to your subsequent exercise routines will make a significant difference in the visible results.

, Don't be afraid to incorporate strength training into your workout; sit ups and some rep-centered weight lifting will tone and accent your natural figure. Megan's exercise schedule incorporates intense core muscle training. Adhering to lower and upper toning exercises (like crunches) will tone your body without adding masculine bulk.


Focus on exercising your abdominals. Megan is big into abdominal exercises.
Make running a consistent part of your daily routine! Whether in the morning or evening, running to train your endurance is an important method of slimming down and burning whatever excess calories left in by your diet.

, One of the most glamorous things about Megan Fox is the pristine glow of her skin and hair. While some of this can be attributed to Hollywood makeup magic, there's no denying that Megan adheres to a very savvy health routine. Getting a healthy shimmer to your skin requires patience and devotion to a regular cleansing routine. While getting better-looking skin will undoubtedly have you looking more like Megan Fox, regular care routines should be based around the characteristics and issues of your own skin.Washing your face regularly is a must for most beauty programs, especially if you are prone to oily skin.
Use a good chapstick or lip balm to avoid dry lips.
Use a face wash that matches your skin type. If you have dry skin, try using a moisturizing face wash. On the other hand, i your skin is oily, you might want to try an astringent cleanser.
Exfoliating your skin on a regular basis will ensure your skin is silky smooth. A build-up of dead skin flakes is one of the most common reasons why your skin may not be as radiant as it should be.

, Get the base of your face ready by using the correct foundation. Use a foundation brush to apply it to your skin. Make sure to match the color to your skin tone so your makeup looks fresh and natural. While Megan Fox has preferred foundations that work for her, it's likely that other pigments will work for your own skin tone. It is important to note that following Megan's cosmetic routines closely may result in a less successful look if your skin is any different from hers. The best thing is to use her style as an aesthetic inspiration whilst trying to formulate your own.


Megan's makeup artist has used Cle de Peau Silk Cream Foundation on her face.
She uses NARS Radian Creamy Concealer in Custard for her under eye circles.
Megan has also stated she likes Giorgio Armani's Luminous Silk Foundation., One of Megan's most famous features is her long, luscious eyelashes. Because she naturally boasts such strong lashes, she doesn't need to use a lot of eye makeup.

Megan pairs her dresses with super high stiletto heels. The added height from heels has a slimming effect on the wearer.

, Although you might think to get glamorous if you're trying to look like a movie star, Megan Fox is arguably even better known for how casually she tends to dress away from the red carpet.

, Primer is not necessary, but you can powder, if you can't bear not to, but ensure it is non-comodegenic and won't look cakey.

,, If they are very dark, however, fill them in with a brown eyebrow pencil, as, although Julie's brows are un-plucked, they are a beautiful beige colour. If necessary, you can shape them, but that is all you should do.

, Again, recreating Julie's flawless complexion is crucial, so invest in a good BB cream or liquid foundation. Squirt a little on the back of your hand and apply evenly around your face either with a stippling brush or a cosmetic sponge. If you feel like you need to apply powder, use is sparingly - you really don't want cakiness or cracking makeup here.

, If you have features that you want to make smaller or accentuate, contouring is a great way to make that happen. Select a bronzer or eyeshadow one to two shades darker than your natural skin tone. You'll also need a good highlighter. To make your nose smaller, like Julie's, take a small, fluffy brush and run the bronzer along the sides of your nose. Blend it in really well. Then slide a little highlighter along the bridge of your nose. She also has amazing cheekbones, so brush a little bronzer along the hollows of your cheeks. Then highlight the tops of your cheekbones to make them stand out a bit.

, Julie has very minimal eye shadow. Before applying anything, use an eye shadow base or a good concealer all over your lids. This will help the color to stay on longer without slipping. Take your highlighter and apply dots of it on the inner corners of your eyes, the middle of the eyelid, and along your brow bone to brighten your eyes. Then use a mild taupe color to accentuate your crease by brushing it along the fold on your lid. Bring the color out a bit to form a subtle shadow, and then sweep a small amount on your lower lash line. It should look subtle but make your eyes stand out, which is exactly what we want.

, Skip the heavy duty, coal-black mascara and go for something in shades of dark brown or grey, and preferably waterproof. Curl your lashes and apply mascara on the top lashes only - we don't want your eyes to be at all bottom heavy.

, Skip the blush altogether - remember, this girl hangs with zombies and you don't want to look to bright.

, Julie has full, nicely arched brows. Get hold of a wax brow pencil for blondes and fill out the front part of your brows slightly, arching them out but keeping the two sides relatively straight. If you already have full brows, gently tweeze the ends a bit.

, Dab a bright, delicious-smelling perfume on the insides of your wrist and on your neck. In the book, R can always smell Julie's ""life scent"", the thing that marks her as one of the living. Choose something not too sweet or flowery - preferably citrus or fruity.

, If you have naturally blue eyes, you can, of course, skip this step, but, if not, it is necessary to do if you long for this zombie lover's exact look.

, Blend it in, and be sure to have moisturised your eyelids (and the rest of your skin) before performing any of these steps. After this, use a beige mascara, brushing out any clumps with an eyelash tool.

, Research bronzer for different face shapes, and be sure to apply some, as Julie has a warm glow to her skin. Avoid blusher, even if it's just used to contour. I mean, this girl hangs with pale zombies!

, Although Julie's lips aren't chapped, they certainly aren't bright, and look beautiful in their natural state.

, Get Julie's tousled look by letting your hair air-dry, straightening it and then using the straightener creating loose curls at the bottom. Be sure to spray with hairspray afterwards, which promises to give your hair that healthy sheen Julie's has.

, Jennifer Lawrence’s brows are dark and full, and not overly arched. Unlike many celebrities, hers typically look natural and product-less. If you aren’t blessed with brows that look just like hers, however, you’ll need to imitate hers with some brow powder, pencil, or pomade.


Using your brow product of choice, fill in areas of your brows that look sparse or uneven. Don’t worry about creating a defined arch or sharp edges, because these should look low maintenance.
If your eyebrows are naturally darker than J.Law’s, brush a bit of light brown eye shadow into your brows.

, Jennifer Lawrence has a slender nose, and a bit of strategic contouring can help you recreate it. Use a small blending brush to sweep the dark contour color down either side of your nose.

When she pairs black with another color, it’s often a white or tan shirt. For awards shows, she often chooses long black dresses in classic styles, although she’s also been photographed in deep red and green.

, When she’s at a serious event, Angelina is a fan of blazers with slacks. Her clothing doesn't draw attention to itself, keeping the focus on her message and her causes.


She favors monochrome for this look as well. She’s been seen in black suits and white ones, most commonly.
Because Angelina wants to be taken seriously, her business look is not too fussy. She won't wear big necklaces and usually pairs a blazer with a simple scoop-necked T-shirt.
She sometimes pairs a blazer with a short skirt.

, When Angelina is not at a big event, you will find her dressed down. She isn’t too dolled up like she is posing for the cameras when she goes to a toy store with her children.


Wear flats. Angelina’s often seen in flats. She dresses for comfort during the day, and you won’t see her going to the grocery store wearing high heels. Nude toned ballet flats are a favorite shoe of Angelina’s, often paired with black clothing.
Don’t wear too many accessories. Angelina never looks too fussy. You aren’t going to find her with big earrings or a lot of bling. She’s more likely to wear simple, but classy, diamond solitaire earrings. Wear leather. Although you saw her in leather more before she became a mother, it’s still one of Angelina’s favorite looks. Who can forget the leather dress she wore to the Mr. and Mrs. Smith film premiere? She wears leather pants, too.

Confidence is everything.,
Get tattoos.,
Show passion for something bigger than yourself.",How to Look Like Angelina Jolie5," Her head is high and body straight. Learn how to build or strengthen your confidence. Remember: We all have flaws, even Angelina herself. Not only would having more confidence make you look more like Angelina, but you will also instantly seem more attractive.


Angelina has a strong sense of who she is. This carries through in her posture and overall appearance. You have to believe in yourself.
Because she is confident, Angelina has a consistent and unique style that is all her own. Although you can follow tips to look more like her, if you don’t let some of your own natural beauty and personality show through, you’re not really going to capture her free spirited, confident vibe. So have enough confidence to stay true to yourself.

, Angelina has had many tattoos over the years. Usually, these are strategically placed on her arms. And they always tell a story.


Make sure your tattoos have meaning. She has tattoos of the coordinates of her children’s birth, for example. She used to have a tattoo that said “Billy Bob” in the name of her former husband. One of her tattoos is a Japanese kanji symbolizing death, but she said she got it to remind herself to live life to the fullest. She is fascinated with death, and used to wear a vial of blood on a necklace.
She also has tattoos on her stomach and wrist. One was to honor her brother and another was a Tennessee Williams’ quote.

, Part of Angelina’s appeal is that she isn’t a vapid celebrity who seems to only care about herself. She is always involved in a cause that is bigger than her own ego.


Angelina loves children. Obviously, she has adopted several children from countries around the world, as well as having children of her own. She is often photographed with a child in tow. The mixture of wild child with mother figure has given Angelina a very earthy appeal.
Angelina has causes. Whether it’s helping people suffering in war-torn countries or those who don’t have enough to eat, Angelina embraces causes and charities and she’s not afraid to roll up her shirt sleeves and go to dangerous or troubled countries on her own. This is a key part about her image. She really cares.

Her hair sometimes tapers off to a slightly lighter colored brown at the ends with a deeper chocolate color at the roots.The color is slightly graduated subtly, though, so that it doesn’t look intentional.
Wear your hair straight. Victoria’s hair is usually straight, and it’s not too layered. You can get this look with a flat iron.;
, Victoria often wears her hair parted in the middle, although she occasionally wears her hair parted on the left side and swept to the right.


She has said that she thinks side bangs don’t work with her face because they make her hair look too thin.
Victoria Justice doesn’t have bangs. Her hair is all one length. She usually wears her hair long, falling past the breasts. Occasionally you will see her with somewhat shorter hair, but still past her shoulders.

, Although Victoria often has very straight hair, occasionally, she will put long, loose waves in her hair.


Sleeping with a braid in your hair or using a large-barreled curling iron can help you accomplish this look. Try sea salt spray to create a beachy look, and use dry texturing spray for finishing touches.Victoria’s hair never looks overly styled and is never too stiff. Her hair is natural, shiny, and flowing. Don’t use too much hairspray if you want to look like her.

, Because her hair is so long, it’s very versatile when it comes to styling. She’s almost always seen with her hair down, but occasionally she mixes that up.


You might see Victoria with her long hair pulled into a side ponytail, with the fastener falling where her shoulder line meets her neck.
She is a fan of romantic looks, and has worn her hair braided at the top or her long hair pulled back off her face.

, Victoria is usually seen with lipstick. However, she doesn’t overdo the makeup, preferring a natural look.


Often, you will see her wearing neutral hues on her lips, such as taupe or mauve. She sometimes wears lip gloss or lip stain, but she also wears matte makeup.
Occasionally, but not as often, Victoria brightens up her lips, generally choosing dark red lipstick or a deep berry color.

, Choose a neutral palette. Victoria usually plays up her eyes, and she favors earthy hues when she does this.


Choose eyeshadows in light and dark brown. Sweep the lighter color over the lids, and apply the darker brown color into the creases.Apply black mascara, and use kohl eyeliner in the waterline of the eyes. Victoria also has thicker, shaped brows. Waxing and threading can create a shaped look. Apply brow powder over the brows, and seal them with brow gel. She prefers what she has described as a bolder brow look. She has said she uses Telescopic mascara by L’Oreal.
Use dark gel eyeliner on the top lash line, and use softer pencil liner underneath the lower lash line and in the waterline of the eye. Victoria has also said she covers up pimples with brown eyeliner, to make them look like beauty marks!

, Victoria is not a person you will always see with makeup caked on her face and in high heels. When she is running around doing errands, she lightens up on the makeup.


She has said she will put on a little lip balm (she likes Burt’s Bees Pomegranate lip balm). She curls her eyelashes.
She wears a little concealer and a little blush, and that’s it. Those are the makeup staples that she is never seen without.

, Victoria is a television star, but she has a big social media following. She has said her favorite social media platform is Instagram.


She loves taking photos and sharing photos of herself, using different filters. Victoria is an active person, so her Instagram site is filled with photos of her life. However, you will often notice that she plays up her eyes in photos. They are dark black, and she uses makeup to bring them out as the dominant feature on her face.

, Victoria’s clothes are usually monochrome colors. She isn’t big on wearing loud patterns, although you will occasionally see her in something subtle, such as a tiny floral pattern or geometric design.


Most often you will see her in vibrant, dark colors, like navy blue, dark green, black, and red. You won’t often see her in looks that are too girlie or pastel.
Victoria occasionally mixes it up with a bright lemon yellow or powder blue, but that’s not the most common look for her.

, Victoria doesn’t often go out with a lot of bling. She accessorizes but only subtly


For example, you might see her with a headband that she wears across her forehead or with a hat on, but these looks are not her most common.
More likely, she wears small silver earrings, clutches a small purse, or wears a small silver necklace.
Her jewelry is not loud. Her smile and beautiful face draw people’s attention, not her accessories.

, Victoria is in great shape, and she often shows that off by wearing cropped tops. She pairs them in different ways to capture versatile looks.


For example, she pairs crop tops with short skirts. She’s also worn them with shorts and blue jeans. Get some fun shirts. Victoria likes to wear cute and random graphic tees, or over-sized plaid button-up shirts.
She likes to show her legs too. When she’s on the red carpet, she often favors shorter cocktail dresses that highlight her legs.

, Victoria is in great shape. One way she keeps in shape is by using different dance routines in her workouts.She has also said that she does lunges and goes for walks. Generally, she stays active.
Victoria is a fan of staying in shape through light exercise and by eating healthy. She is not too thin. She has an athletic, slim build.

, Looking as good as Victoria takes discipline. She has said that she eats a clean and healthy diet that is heavy on protein and low on processed carbohydrates.


For breakfast, she might have toast, fish oil, egg whites, and a protein shake of rice milk and greens. For lunch, she eats protein (she loves bacon) and green vegetables.
For dinner, it’s back to protein, such as grilled steak. She again loads up on the green vegetables, such as spinach. Eat a lot of protein and a lot of green vegetables to look like her, and avoid excessive amounts of sugar.

, Victoria’s look is not too high maintenance, and she always has a younger vibe. So be able to let your hair down and dress down at times.


She is a fan of blue jeans. She will often pair them with a cool T shirt or nicer shirt. She favors the skinny jean look, often in light denim tones. She also enjoys wearing blazers, which she will pair with statement T-shirts.
A fitted denim jacket is also something that she would wear. She also likes pencil dresses with a relaxed waistline. Her look is sexy, but she doesn’t show too much cleavage., Victoria’s shoes add a splash of creativity to her outfits, and they are often chosen for comfort. She isn’t a person always running around in spiked high heels.


She once posted a picture on Instagram of a pair of sneakers she turned into watermelon using DIY. She is also a fan of ankle boots, a look she will often pair with short skirts or blue jeans. You will see her wearing sneakers.
Victoria is always seen in Converse. Buy a couple different pairs of high-top and low-top Converse in whatever colors you'd like. Be original and creative with one of the pairs - mess them up a little! Draw on them with Sharpies and fabric markers, or get your friends to sign them. Victoria loves doing this!

Hygiene: Robin is always seen looking neat, clean, and beautiful.,
Get Fit: Robin has a very nice body type and she works out a lot.",How to Look Like Robin Scherbatsky from HIMYM," The longest she had her hair was a little past her shoulders at the beginning of HIMYM, but towards the end she started cutting it shorter; so you can choose to either have it a little past your shoulders or shorter. Color- Robins hair is usually either a dark brown or black so keep your hair a dark color. Style- Robin either styles her hair in loose curls or sometimes she'll wear it straight. She usually wears her hair down but there are sometimes when she wears it up. On special occasions she will put clips and headbands on to accessorize but usually she doesn't keep anything in her except maybe a few bobby pins. And for a part she usually parts in on the side or sometimes in the middle.;
, Only wear foundation and or concealer, eyeliner and mascara (not too dark or too heavy), a lipgloss or a natural looking lipstick (she does wear red lipstick sometimes though), and MAYBE a little bit of blush and natural looking eyeshadow like a brown or a pink.

, I recommend shopping at places like Nordstrom. However if you can't afford that you can shop at places like Gap, Nordstrom Rack, Marshall's, TJMaxx, or even places like forever 21 (or any place in the mall), also Abercrombie sometimes has really great sales; its just all about buying the right things. Some of Robin's signature pieces are:


cute blouses
classy sweaters
dark jeans
skirts
classy capri pants
nice dresses
long trench or wool coats
blazers
ballet flats
classy heels
short boots
leather boots
tights

, Some of her casual signature pieces are:


skinny jeans
dark leggings
tank tops
classy t-shirts
casual (but still classy) sweaters and blazers
jean shorts
and for casual shoes she will usually just wear some comfortable heels, boots, or ballet flats

, She'll just wear a nice necklace, some classy earring, and maybe a watch or bracelet.

,


brush your teeth and tongue, and floss at least twice a day (also consider whitening products)
bathe at least once a day and use a deodorant
wash your hair as often as needed (some people need to wash their hair everyday, some only need to do it once a week; whatever is necessary for you)
also for your hair consider going to a salon every so often just to get it cut or trimmed or styled or even just checked on to make sure it's healthy
make sure your clothes are always clean and neat
for your face get a facial cleanser, acne treatment (if necessary), a toner (if necessary), and a moisturizer with SPF
moisturize your body
take care of your nails whether you get them done at a salon or do them yourself make sure you cute them, clean them, and get a nice nail polish (try some classy solid colors or a french tip)

, Try getting a gym membership. If this doesn't work for you there are others ways to work out. Join a sports team, buy workout DVDs, go for a walk or a run, ride a bike. Whatever you choose to do just make sure to do it at least 180 minutes a week. Also try to eat healthy: follow the food pyramid and write down what you eat. It is very important to be healthy

Maintenance.",How to Look Like Cameron Diaz," If you smoke, stop. Now. IMMEDIATELY. Cameron quit smoking in a bid to help her acne. If she can do it, so can you. Get into the cleanse-tone-moisturize routine. It sounds cheesy, but your mother always did know best... Use products that match your skin type; i.e. dry - cream cleanser/non-drying toner/rich SPF moisturizer. Combination/Oily - foaming cleanser/toner/light oil-free moisturizer with SPF for day and slightly richer at night. Spotty skin is often sensitive, so natural products are best. Pore strips are a God-send if you have a blackhead-ridden nose. Zinc tablets are rumoured to be helpful with acne.;
, Moisturize beforehand with a moisturizer that matches your skin type. Get a foundation that matches your skin tone, preferably two different shades (before and after tanning). Next, use foundation just enough to even out your skin tone. Blend a creamy concealer into any blemishes or under-eye dark circles. Apply loose powder with a large powder brush, or pressed powder with a sponge for the most matte coverage. Sweep a naturally rosy pink blush into the apple of your cheeks. For a day look, wear neutral colours on both eyes and lips. Use a a shimmery gold/brown eyeshadow, lots of jet-black mascara and a barely-there brown pencil eyeliner, with rosy pink natural lip gloss and lip liner (if you wear liner). For a little more glamorous night look; red lips can be used with the neutral eyes described above, or grey/black smokey eyes and the natural lips.

, Wear low rise, floor-skimming jeans all the time. Her denim is usually more washed-out for daytime looks and darker for evening looks. Own many casual tops/tees. Vertical stripes, head-to-toe colour and long dark jeans make you look taller, a prerequisite for looking like 5'9"" Miss Diaz. Cameron is all about t-shirts and tanks. Incorporate some surfer into your style.

, Cameron loves hats, and usually wears them perfectly with casual outfits. She includes fedoras, berets and baseball caps (among others). Her jewelry is usually simple and minimal. She may wear one necklace or earrings with a splash of color, often turquoise or green which suit her colouring. Again, be a little edgy/surfer with your style.

, Do wear shoes with a rise or heel of around 2 inches (5.1 cm). Platform, wedge and square heel styles are the most practical for regular use. Sling backs, pointed and low-cut toe-cleavage shoes are elongating to the foot and leg, so you look taller.

, Cameron has a round face, so hopefully you do too! If not, her cut is quite adaptable, but take a picture to a salon and talk to your hairdresser beforehand. Get side bangs, layers and create a deep side part and sweep your bangs heavy to the other side. Change your hair color from highlighted blonde to brown if you want. For a casual look start with wavy dry hair, then pull your hair loosely back and twist it into a loose/messy bun. Secure into place with Kirby grips and spritz with hairspray to finish. For a more put-together finish, use straight hair, leave your bangs out and direct the rest of your hair into a ponytail. Wrap your hair around the elastic band at the base of the ponytail, tuck in the ends and pin into place. Alternatively, you could put the bangs into a quiff. Also for a curly look, use mousse to give volume and blow-dry upside-down, finishing by using straighteners/tongs to curl the hair from the top of the ear down. Don't forget to use heat protection and a weekly intensive hair mask.

, Be bubbly and sexy. Don't worry that you don't have the biggest boobs or the most on-trend fashion (Cameron is B-cup and dresses to her shape rather than the catwalk). Be confident and nice. Smile all the time. Be really happy. Keep your thoughts reasonable and think positively. Lighten up. Don't take yourself too seriously. Try not to over-analyze things. Stress can cause many mental, physical, and spiritual problems in your life. One of the major causes of stress is worrying about things that are out of your control. Learn to recognize these things and if you can truly do nothing about them, then just let them go. Take time to laugh at yourself and the situations you find yourself in. Laughter is a powerful, positive medicine and the calmer and more peaceful you can take things, the happier your life will be.

, Get some inspiration on how Cameron walks, talks, acts, looks and dresses from the films she has starred in. She first found fame in The Mask; and has since starred in films like The Sweetest Thing, Charlie's Angels, There's Something About Mary and In Her Shoes. She is also the voice of the fabulous Princess Fiona from the Shrek trilogy. Do some movie research!

, Get clean. Bathe/shower once a day. Feeling and looking clean is important. Wash with a scented body gel (soap is drying) and a loofah/bath scrubber and it will smell great. Get out and pat yourself dry with a towel, rub in some rich body lotion and use deodorant/antiperspirant. You need to be soft and cuddly at all times (do not neglect your knees and elbows). If possible, try to layer matching scents on your body; such as citrus shower gel, citrus body lotion, citrus deodorant, and citrus perfume. Musky or floral scents are also delicious.

, Create a work-out plan. Lunges/crunches/squats/weights etc twice a week and cardio three times a week. Cameron is well-known for her lean and toned body shape. Crunches equal flat, hard ab muscles, lunges equal toned legs, and squats a toned backside. Running or jogging works for cardio and utilizes all the muscles of the body and increases your stamina, but get some decent trainers if you run on tarmac. Cameron is famed for her surfing, which she learned for the film 'Charlie's Angels'. She also enjoys hiking and snow-boarding, which are great for all-round toning. Go on her trainer's (Teddy Bass) website for help.

, Get a gorgeous, glowing tan. Use FAKE TAN lotion only, not a sunbed. Definitely wear bronzer and always wear sun-screen every day. Exfoliate and moisturize thoroughly a couple of hours before a spray tan or home tanning.

, Keep neatly groomed and shaped eyebrows. Have a perfect arch. Get them waxed/shaped professionally. The skinnier the better, but not so skinny that you only have 6 hairs left. NATURAL skinny, not hugely chubby/non-existent brows. If you keep them well groomed (tweezing every fortnight) it will make your eyes pop and make you look more youthful (not baby-style, but pretty). Lightly fill in any uneven patches with a matching brow pencil.

, Weekly; use a clarifying shampoo, an intensive hair mask, exfoliating body scrub and a face mask (to match your skin type). Also weekly, have a bath and give yourself a pedicure & manicure. Polish colours that are popular with Miss Diaz include chocolate brown, fire-engine red and au natural clear. Regularly have your hair cut and coloured/re-highlighted (about every 6 weeks).

Get blue contacts.,
Dye your hair brown.,
Wear little makeup.,
Look neat and clean.,
Dress fashionably and girlishly, but with a conservative slant.,
Adopt some of her mannerisms.",How to Look Like Rory Gilmore," Blue eyes are by far Rory's most prominent feature. This is not a must, though. If you already have blue eyes, rock them! Rory's eyes are a bright, crystal blue, so buy fluorescent light bulbs and avoid places with awful lighting if you can.;
, Having brown hair makes you look serious and mature, and you would not look too outstanding, which is something Rory is well known for. You could even use a brown wig.

, Rory does not really wear much makeup, but if she does, she would keep it natural and light. A light pink blush and tinted moisturiser is all that is needed. Follow suit.

, Have brains and beauty if you can, but don't try too hard because Rory is pretty but isn't obsessed with her looks. She also always keeps her appearance neat and tidy.

, Try to keep your outfits quite simple, and don't be materialistic. Rory doesn't really seem to care about having the most expensive clothes. She has a classic look, which would definitely be taken away if she began shopping at only designer places. Buy plain colored, button down shirts, slacks, and a few funky shirts for the weekends. Be creative, but conservative. Be light on the accessories, but add something different for a soft touch. For example, Rory will add scarves and leggings/stockings to add something unique to her simplistic style.

, This would complete the Rory Gilmore look, or attitude.

Get straight A's, or at least the best grades you can. Rory is academically successful. Rory is extremely intelligent, and would never let her grades drop. Work to form excellent study habits. If possible, apply to an exclusive private school. This isn't necessary, but it would help.






Be organized and punctual.






Set both short-term and long-term goals for yourself - daily, weekly, monthly, etc.






Learn to drive. Rory likes to drive a car, that strengths her independence.






Read a work of literature a week. If you are choosing novels that are more trying and/or longer in length and have a busy schedule, going for one a month is a good idea. Have also an easier, enjoyable book to alternate with if you need a break from a more difficult book. Rory tends to read many classics: a couple of examples from the show are: The Art of War (one relatively short in length, by the way), Moby Dick. She also goes through a phase of choosing Russian authors. But any books with some kind of substance will do. Don't forget to carry around the book!






Keep busy by studying, volunteering, working, watching movies, and spending time with family and friends.






Drink coffee. On evenings, drink decaf. If you don't like coffee, try a chai latte or green tea when you visit your local coffee shop. (In fact, Alexis Bledel, the actress that plays Rory is so sick of coffee that she only drinks tea now.)






Perfect your etiquette. Rory has good manners. Avoid using vulgarities and slang.






Make lots of lists. Rory is always writing lists. She also makes her classic ""pro-con"" list to aid in decision making (eg. when she was choosing between Harvard and Yale and Princeton).






Be witty and keep up with the humor. You either have a similar sense of humor to Rory or you don't, so if you don't have a witty or dry humor naturally, then don't bother trying to. You might end up sounding dumb--like you don't know what your talking about. You can learn to Talk Like a Gilmore Girl however.






Read a lot; any kind of book. It is a must, because it is her main hobby, and she spends a lot of time doing it.






Be nice to everyone.

Wear a sparkly top.,
Wear the right bottoms.,
Consider adding a maroon kimono.,
For makeup, add pale purple shades, and red lipstick be creative but DO NOT go overboard.,
Make your hair look like Elsa's.",How to Look Just Like Elsa from Frozen1," Good places to look are Macy's, Lulus, Amazon, Pacsun, and Aeropostale. Blue and purple are the preferred colors.;
, A maxi skirt that fades is probably your best option. You can get maxi skirts from the places listed above.

, This goes with a lot of outfits. Maybe add some gloves to dress up the look a bit.

, This can easily clash with your outfit. You have to remember that Elsa is animated and most likely has a different complexion and face ""genetics"" than you do. Add a pretty, rosy blush to the apples of your cheeks.

, Twist your hair up above your left eyebrow to the back of your hair and secure it with an elastic. Leave half of your bangs on your forehead, just like Elsa does.

Try to wear long sleeves.,
Consider short sleeved tops instead.,
Put on a sheer blue/white kimono with rhinestones on it.,
Add purple hues to your makeup.,
Make a French fishtail braid in your hair.",How to Look Just Like Elsa from Frozen2," It fits more ""Elsa"" as she is not very open about herself, plus she doesn't expose much skin. Places to get good long sleeves are:


Aeropostale
Macy's
Hollister
H&M

, If you like short sleeves more than long sleeves, you can also go to the Disney Store to buy ""Let it go"" graphic tees or one with Elsa on it.

, The rhinestones will look like snowflakes. You can even get a kimono with a big snowflake on the back with little snowflakes around it, or even make your own snowflakes out of rhinestones.

, However, if you don't wear ""crazy"" colors, that's totally fine! You can wear natural makeup if you like, as it is all about being confident in yourself. You can also wear lots of mascara, but not so much that your lashes become stiff and caked.

, This braid starts at the middle of her head, so keep that in mind. Here is what you do to make it:


Pull out your bangs.
Grab a section and divide it in two.
From the right side, take a chunk and cross it over the left.
Now from the left side, take a chunk and cross it over to the right.
Repeat until the remaining hair is about the size of your other pieces.
Take the remaining hair and cross it over whatever side you are on.
Now you have 3 strands.
Braid until you reach the ends.

"
Make your skin blue.,
Take a darker blue colour for the almost zebra stripes the Navi's wear and line them along your legs and shorts, arms and all the way up your torso on the tank top.,
Buy a pair of tight Lycra blue shorts (cycling shorts are perfect) and a body hugging tank top.,
Put lots of natural jewelry like feathers, wooden beads, maybe some brown or tan shells, or other natural things.,
Braid your hair into tiny strands, this will take forever but it will look amazing!,
For the ears buy some ready made ""Star Trek Spock"" pointy ones from a joke shop and paint them blue.,
For the tail, take a piece of garden wire about 6 feet (1.8 m) long.,
For your face, use this image as a guide.,
For shoes, just attach some beads and feathers onto a regular pair of brown sandals or even cheap flip flops.

,
And there you go, a completely realistic, stunningly gorgeous, definitely eye-catching and individual design!,
However you choose to achieve this look, have fun with it and go as crazy and over the top as you like!

",How to Look Like a Na'vi," A lot of people tend to use blue tights or even go as far as wearing a full body morph suit to achieve the gorgeous blue skin of an avatar. If you wish to do this, fine. However, it doesn't look half as amazing, realistic or striking as using your own skin! Or, you can paint your entire body including your face a vibrant blue colour. Use a tanning mitt or sponge to get a more even coverage! Try snazaroo paint. It's clean, easy to apply and the vibrant, long lasting colours are perfect for partying!;
, Be careful to leave the tummy area clean with the lines pointing inwards!

, This sounds ridiculously ""cringey"" but you really want it to blend into your skin and make it look like you're not wearing clothes! When you're finished, everybody will be too stunned by your awesome creation to care if you're wearing tight bicycle pants.# As far as clothes go, Ney'tiri wore very little! As you are already wearing a tank top and so are fully covered in that respect, you can leave your top area bare as she did. However, if you're feeling a little shy you can always wear a brown bikini top!


She had a kind of brown ""flappy"" material piece over her bottom half. Wear a pair of brown bikini bottoms and temporarily sew a patch of brown suede material onto the front like a flap. Cut the bottom edge in rough zigzags like hers. Remember, thanks to the cycling shorts, you are covered up anyway so this flap just makes the shorts look even more skin-like and realistic! If you are not feeling so brave and bold, you can always opt for tan/brown shorts instead of the flap and blue cycling shorts!

, This is the key to this costume and put LOTS of it! Simply attach feathers and random beads to a string. It looks incredibly realistic this way! You can get moonstones and gems bracelets, anklets, anything with leaves or natural designs is great!

, If you don't have black hair or it's too short, you can always get a ready braided wig. It would save you a lot of hassle! String a load of coloured beads onto some braids at the front and attached some feathers onto your earrings!

, They are much easier, comfier and more convenient to use than a piece of folded blue fabric.

, Bent it in half so you have a gap about an inch thick inside and then wrapped blue material like felt around the wire to create a realistic and possible tail! Paint dark stripes on the end of the tail then attach to the costume!

, Remember to get an even, smooth face paint coverage and use a darker colour for the stripes. The white dots should be tiny and dainty like hers!

,,


You can be even portray the personality of Ney'tiri- fierce, independent, wild-spirited, up for anything, bold, fun and brave!

Dye your hair.,
Get into a good skin routine.,
Brush your teeth after breakfast and dinner.,
Wax your eyebrows so they're very neat.,
For make-up, get a foundation that is about one shade lighter then your skin tone.,
Make sure you smell great.,
Katherine has very good dress sense.,
For your hair, when it is fully grown and most like Katherine's, you will need to start styling it.,
Make witty and sarcastic remarks.,
Put yourself in front of others.,
Don't be clumsy at all.,
Only ever smirk.,
Be mysterious to everyone around you.,
Be focused.,
If you are involved with someone, be immature and playful.,
Don't have any close friends.,
Be focused.,
Put yourself first.,
Have your own rules.,
Be fun and flirty.,
Be impatient.,
Be secretive.,
Don't be afraid and do what feels right:) You Don't have to change yourself.",How to Look and Act Like Katherine Pierce," If you are blonde, or any other shade of hair colour apart from dark brown, get it dyed by a professional hairdresser, although if you've read the books both Katherine and Elena are blonde. Try to grow your hair long like Katherine's. Whilst you're growing it try not to heat style it as this can damage your hair a lot and cause split ends while you're growing it. Also wash your hair at LEAST every second day because if you wash it everyday it will remove the natural oils from your hair. If you have a fringe or something, pin it back while you're growing it. If you want more instant result get hair extensions.;
, Katherine wears very natural make-up so if you want to pull this off you need to have a good base. Cleanse, tone and moisturize every morning and night. Scrub your face about three times a week and do a facial mask once a week. Also moisturize your arms, legs, front, back and your hands so your skin is super smooth. It might take up some time in the mornings and nights but it will be worth if after you start seeing results.

, It's important to keep your teeth super white. So go to the dentist to get them cleaned every 11 months and if you need it get a teeth whitener. To be a ""vampire"" you should have very white teeth.

, Also shave any unwanted hair on your legs, arms (if you need it), down there (Down there is optional..) and underarms. Hairy legs and underarms isn't very attractive so shave these areas at least every day or every second day.

, It can be liquid or powder, whatever you're more comfortable with. Apply foundation all over your face and make sure you blend it in on the edges so it looks natural and you don't have that horrible line. Next apply a thin layer of liquid eyeliner on your top lids as near to your lashes as possible. Curl your eyelashes and apply about 3 coats of clump-free mascara to them. For lipstick get a fairly natural colour or you could use lip gloss. If you want the masquerade look do the same for everything except give your liner a bit of a thicker line with a small wing and apply red lipstick.

, Use a deodorant that has really no smell but is an antiperspirant. This will stop you from sweating excessively. Next find a perfume that you like and that gives off a really nice and kind of sexy scent. If you're shopping for a perfume, sniff coffee beans in-between about every two perfumes so your smell doesn't get mixed up.

, Buy a couple of different tank tops in different colours. Make sure they're well fitted and hug your shape. Next buy a couple of different leather jackets and black tights along with dark wash jeans. For shoes high heeled boots will work best as this is what Katherine always wears. Soon you can add onto your wardrobe and get your own peaces that remind you of Katherine. For formal events get a nice little black dress of some sort and pumps. When buying your own pieces, look around the darker types of clothing.

, If you don't want to heat style it, there is a thing such as curling your hair with a sock. Youtube it, the results are great. But if you want a more instant result, buy a curling iron. Section off the top half of your hair and curl your hair away from your face. Then pull down the top half and do the same. If your hair is more thicker, you might need to pull down about 1 more part or so before you curl the top half of your hair. Remember to always curl away from your face.

, You don't always have to be serious with people unless you really need to be. Be sarcastic, and don't be afraid to be a little mean too. Katherine has never gone out of her way to be nice with anyone.

, If you really want something, don't be afraid to put them down for it. Make sure you have plans for everything that you want to achieve and even if that means pushing someone aside. Don't kill anyone like Katherine, this is murder and you can have serious charges. You just don't have to be nice. But be careful who you say what too, because if you threaten someone in any way they could press charges.

, Don't let anyone scare you, and at like nothing surprise you. Don't walk around sharp corners right near the wall, walk around corners far away from them so no one can jump out. Be very weary but don't look like you're scared or anything. You have to look powerful like nothing could phase you.

, It's not like Katherine to show any facial expression except for a flirty smile or evil smirk. So if you're up to something or have something on your mind smirk and if you're with a guy give them a flirty smile. Flirt with guys, even if they're in a relationship but don't swoop low, only flirt with really good looking guys. Play mind games with them, get close when you're flirting with them, not emotionally, just physically. Keep them guessing if you want a relationship or if you're just playing around.

, Not mysterious as in I'm a weird loner that goes weird places and does weird things that no one understands. But be mysterious as in, no one knows what you're really up too and what you're going to do. You can't be an open book. Always look like there is something you're sort of occupied on other then the situation you're in. Like you want something.

, Look like you're constantly focused on something even if you're not to people you're not really involved with.

, Giggle and make evil jokes in the wrong time. Just be very immature but not childish immature.

, Don't give out advise, and act like you don't care if someone is seeking for advise. You can be that fun mysterious girl that is really good to be around at parties and stuff but don't be close to anyone. Even family really, although you should have at least one good friend for support. They can be your partner in crime.

, Katherine knows exactly what she wants and isn't afraid to go for it. So make yourself clear what you want and always look at the bigger picture. Don't let your feelings get in your way. But you have to know what's worth it and what isn't, so you don't end up losing control.

, Katherine doesn't care whom she hurts as long as it's in her own interest. She would do anything to get what she wants, like manipulating people. So she is often described as cruel and self - centered.

, Katherine never does anything just because somebody told her to.

, Katherine always finds a way to have fun. She is very beautiful and uses her beauty and attraction to get what she wants. For example pretending to love or like somebody because he has something you want or can help you get it.She loves attention and wants to be in the centre of attention all the time.

, Katherine gets bored easily and often loses her temper if something doesn't work right away. Sometimes she acts impulsive but also knows how to reverse it.

, Never let anyone know what exactly you're up to. Katherine doesn't let someone peek into her cards as long as it's not necessary for her plans. If anyone asks just simply say ""you'll see."" and walk away.

, its simply being 'inspired' !"

Her hair is flat at the top, but by all means not straight. It has curves and slight waves at the ends, and sometimes she will wear it in tight little pin curls. Any of these styles are easily established with a flat-iron or curling-iron.;
, As far as make-up goes, Rachel is known to wear natural makeup: foundation the color of her natural skin, light pink or tan eye-shadow, dark mascara, and light pink lip-gloss. Keep it natural like Rachel does - nothing bright or bold. Don't overdo the make-up! You don't want to look like you were just in an opera.

Rachel Berry has at least a dozen different plaid skirts!

Line the eyes with the black eyeliner on the top lash line and on lower lash line. Mila also usually puts black liner in the waterline of the eye. Her eye liner slips inside the inner eye rims. Mute the eyeliner on the top lid a bit, perhaps by going over it with gray eyeshadow.She finishes off the look with a coat of black mascara on both the lower and upper lashes. Mila’s look is all about smoky eyes. False eyelashes could help get you Mila’s striking eyes if your lashes are not naturally long.;
, To continue playing up the smoky eye look, Mila favors eyeshadow in gray, white, and tan color schemes. You might see her with dark purple eyeshadow for a big night out.


Mila favors sparkling eyeshadow at times. Dust the taupe eye shadow all the way around the eyes and up to the creases on the top lids. Take three of your favorite eye shadow colors, but focus on neutrals.
Apply the lightest color first and sweep it over your eyes up to your eyebrows. Then, take the next darker color, and put that in the center of your eyelid. Then, take the third darkest color and put them on the outer edge of your eye. Make sure you blend with a brush., Mila’s eyebrows are dark and shaped. They aren’t too thin. Although they are on the thicker side, they are neatly shaped.


To better shape the brows, take an small angled brow brush and use dark brown eye powder. This will create a natural look.
Use transparent brow gel after you apply the brow powder, in order to seal the look and retain the shaped eyebrows., Mila’s hair is a dark chocolate brown with only the most subtle of golden highlights threaded throughout. She usually wears her hair parted in the middle.


Mila’s hair is straight. It flows well past her shoulders to her breast line. Her dark hair is very shiny. Apply a shine spray to get the look.You won’t find Mila with very short or very curly hair. Every now and then, she plays with her part and will wear the part to the side. However, usually her part is in the middle. When she dresses up, you will sometimes see Mila with long waves in her hair. These can be created with a large barreled curling iron.

, When her hair isn’t down and straight and long, she’s likely to pull her hair into a tight ponytail. If she’s dressed up, she will often pull her hair up into a more formal updo.


When she’s out for a night on the town, Mila will sometimes wear her hair in a less stark updo, in which she allows soft waves to frame her face.
If wearing the hair up to go out, choose a pair of statement earrings in dark colors such as ruby red or deep emerald. If it’s a more casual day, Mila will often wear her hair in a ponytail without earrings at all.

, Because Mila puts the emphasis on her eyes, she doesn’t overdo the lipstick. It’s all about balance.


The key is to put just a touch of color on the lips. If she’s dressed up, she might put a light orange-red on her lips. She’s been spotted with neutral lips more often. You will often see Mila with glistening lips in neutral hues and tan, even when she is dressed up and out on the town.Wear nail polish. Especially when she’s dressing up to go out, Mila will be seen with nail polish. Blood red is a color she likes., Mila has a natural olive and golden hue to her skin. If your skin looks ultra pale, you won’t look exactly like Mila.

Try a spray tan or tanning lotion to get Mila’s slightly olive glow. If spray tanning, make sure you wear the recommended safety gear.
You could try using bronzing powder to get the Mila glow. Put translucent powder on your face first with a makeup brush in order to get her flawless complexion. Use blusher only lightly., You won’t see Mila in pastels or frilly girl clothes. You’re more likely to see her in hues of black, charcoal gray, and white.


Mila has a bit of the goth in her. She’s described herself as having an inner geek side. She’s never seen in overly complicated patterns or frilly lace. She likes simple lines and neutral or dark colors.
Dress in a solid color and, if in doubt, choose black. It’s the color she’s seen in most often, and it looks great on her. Mila is a fan of short jackets, especially jean jackets.

, Mila dresses up nicely, even though she likes to dress down a lot. When she dresses up, you’re likely to see her in form fitting sheaths.


Usually, Mila chooses dresses in black. Sometimes, she will choose a white dress. The only color she really goes for regularly is red. She would favor a cocktail dress in sparkly gray.
Mila favors a V-shaped neckline. She favors strapless dresses to show off her shoulders. She also likes silk dresses and pantsuits.

, Mila is often seen in blue jeans and in slacks, when she’s dressing up. She mixes sex appeal with seeming like she would be fun to hang around with. Be a free spirit; Mila is the kind of person who’d be game for a road trip at the last minute.


She is not high maintenance. You could imagine her sitting around and playing video games as well as heading out to an awards ceremony. You might see her in a baseball hat or even a flannel shirt.
Black trouser slacks are a good look when dressing up, perhaps with a white buttoned-down silk shirt., Don’t always be dressed up. You won’t see Mila in high heels when she goes to get coffee. You’re more likely to see her in leggings and tennis shoes.


Mila often wears statement T-shirts. She will often pair them with leggings or blue jeans, her hair in a ponytail, and wearing a pair of sunglasses.
She has been seen in skinny jeans. She has also been seen in baggier blue jeans. Be the kind of girl who can be ""one of the guys."" Play video games. She loves them.

, Mila got into tip-top shape when she was in the movie Black Swan. To do so, she worked out five days a week (when not in a movie, she works out three). Mila appears athletic, and she is in great shape. However, it doesn’t seem like fitness is her entire life.


She ate a well-balanced meal that included low glycemic carbs, proteins and essential fats. Mila says in interviews that she likes more outdoorsy activities like snowboarding or dancing. When it comes to dieting, it’s healthiest to eat lots of fresh fruit and vegetables, and even eat the foods you love, just in moderation with smaller portion sizes.
She combines strength and endurance workouts, consisting of six movements in a 40-minute circuit without rest."

Be extremely academic and intelligent.",How to Look Like Lana Lang," Lana's raven hair is perennially long and naturally straight with an occasional feathered or layered cut to frame the face. Hair can be dyed a deep chestnut colour and the use of straightening irons or permanent straightening chemicals will achieve a sleek look if hair has a natural wave or curl. Keep hair always clean as greasy hair is anything but fresh, and interesting with the use of exotic clips to pin hair back.;
, That means washing/showering daily with soap.

, If you want soft skin like hers, moisturize with a body lotion after showering. This help make you skin look and feel super smooth.

, Lana wears a kryptonite stone that is similar to an emerald which brings out the colour of her eyes. Birthstones are also a good option.

, Keep them in prime condition by cutting them back to promote healthy growth and using a cuticle and hand cream regularly. File them across and rounded off at the edges and keep neat with a coat of clear base. Never wear bright or outlandish colours.

, Lana uses Neutrogena Deep Clean facial cleanser followed by Aveda Tourmaline Charged Hydrating Creme or a moisturizer by Kiehl's. Drink eight glasses of water daily to clarify skin, and use specific acne treatment to combat blemishes (Clinique's Anti-Blemish Solutions is a good beauty system to use for a clear, healthy complexion) However skincare need not be expensive, by simply using a cleanser and moisturizer regularly, this will help to make skin clear and bright.

, Use a light foundation or tinted moisturizer to disguise any blemishes, but only use where needed or else it looks too obvious. The idea is to fake natural skin perfection. Finish with one coat of brown mascara, a peachy cream blush, a lip balm, and a sheer brown eye-shadow. Use blotting sheets during summer.

, Wear a fitted vest but make it more appropriate with a loose shirt on top.

, Boot-cuts flatter her petite figure, and are unsurprisingly teamed with leather boots.

, Clothing need not be designer or high-end, simply easy, comfortable clothes that are appropriate for school and hanging out with friends. Pretty floral shirts and classic henleys, tanks and t-shirts are every day essentials.

, Read classics such as Dr Zhivago and Shakespeare.

, Kim's signature look is her smoky eyes. For this look, you need eyeshadow in a mixture of gold and nude tones. Find an eyeshadow combination that goes from light nude brown to gold to darker brown.


Start by applying the bright highlight color in the inner corner of the eye. Spread it from the tear duct to the middle of your eye. Go no higher than your natural crease.
Next use the gold shadow. Brush the gold color over the eyelid from the crease down. Start at the outer corner of the eye and blend with the highlight color as you go inward. Because of the white highlight color, the inside of the eyelid will be brighter than the edge.
Use a small brush to line the crease with a darker brown shade. Then, use a blending brush to blend the crease color with the rest of the lid.

Section your hair into small 1-inch sections. Using your curling iron, curl each section. Make sure you curl the hair away from the face.

Show cleavage.,
Stay fit, but retain your curves.,
Eat healthy.",How to Look Like Kate Upton1," Let’s be blunt here. One of the main things – if not the signature thing - that Kate Upton is known for is her cleavage. Kate is very well-endowed, and her breasts are full and natural looking. If you don’t have large breasts, you won’t look like Kate Upton.


You should ask why you really want to look like anyone else, but, if you’re determined, and you’re not naturally as endowed as she is (frankly, almost no one is), then you could use an old beauty pageant trick, and tape your breasts. Use surgical tape or sports strapping tape.Put one end of the tape under your left armpit. Pull, and lift your breasts together. Bring the tape under your breasts to the right armpit.
Stand upright, and push your breasts together. Take another piece of tape, and apply it from the outer side of the left breast over the nipples and through to the outer part of the right breast. Apply another piece of tape above that one to reinforce it. You can also put a strip of tape under the breasts to lift them.To obtain the cleavage look that Kate is well known for, you could also try purchasing a push-up bra with padding. You can put silicon chicken cutlets in the bra to boost cleavage.;
, The thing about Kate is that she is healthy and fit, but she still has curves. She has endured her share of body-shaming by people used to stick-thin models.


Embrace your curves with confidence. Kate does. In that way, she is a positive role model for women who come in all shapes and sizes.
Don’t work out so much that you sand off and lose your curves. Kate does not have a gaunt look. However, her body is toned. She enjoys circuit training routines that focus on a combination of upper body, lower body, compound and sprint exercises. In circuit training, you complete a circuit, rest for 60 seconds, and then move on to the next circuit.Kate enjoys Pilates, Yoga, martial arts, and Zumba. She usually uses an exercise program that contains a mixture of those programs. Try doing squats and dead lifts., Kate stays fit with a healthy diet that doesn’t allow for junk food. She is known for avoiding red meat.


You will find Kate eating oatmeal and salad. She has also said that she eats scrambled eggs with spinach for breakfast, quinoa with grilled chicken and grilled vegetables, and grilled salmon.
Her diet avoids processed carbs like white bread, white rice, and white pasta. If she’s hungry for a snack, she reaches for a protein bar or 10 raw almonds."

The juniors section is a section of a department or clothing store that sells items for preteen and teenaged girls. Even if you're older and do not still fit into juniors size clothing, browsing the juniors section can give you a sense of the proper Hannah Montana attire. Hannah Montana was meant to be a preteen girl, so her tastes would be fitting with the juniors section.Hannah Montana was known for wearing bright colors or pastel shades of pink and purple.
Keep in mind, however, Hannah Montana is a somewhat dated show. While the juniors section can help, avoid any trends that have been popular in recent history. This will not mesh with the style at the time Hannah Montana was on the air.;
, Hannah Montana was the child of a famous country stare in the show, so shirts with a country-western inspired look can help. Go for something like a plaid button down top. This can help give off the country vibe Hannah Montana is known for.As Hannah Montana was a preteen girl, a brighter western shirt may help. A pink button down plaid top, for example, would be a good choice.

, Hannah Montana was known for layering her outfits. Grab a jacket, cardigan, or blazer to throw over your top.Once again, girlish colors are best. Go for shades like pink, purple, yellow, and pastels.
If you're going for a blazer or jacket, look for one with clunky buttons. Hannah Montana wore a lot of blazers/jackets with big, metallic buttons.
Some of Hannah Montana's blazers had decorations. A beige blazer with flowers or butterflies embroidered on the sleeves can be a nice choice.

, Hannah frequently performed somewhat casually. If you're doing a cowgirl look, go for bootcut jeans or similarly casual pants. For example, capris could work as they're generally cut in a way that can show off cowboy boots., Hannah did occasionally wear skirts over jeans. If you want a more girlish iteration of Hannah Montana, a colorful miniskirt can help. This can be worn with bright tights or leggings underneath.


If you're wearing your costume to school, check your school's dress policy. Skirts may have to be a certain length to be appropriate for school property.

, Hannah Montana was known for her cowboy boots. Make sure you add a pair of cowboy boots to your costume if you want to dress like Hannah Montana.


If possible, make sure the boots are specifically sold as cowboy boots. In a pinch, any knee-high boot can work, but cowboy boots will truly solidify the Hannah Montana vibe.

, You can buy Hannah Montana DVDs, watch Hannah Montana online, or use a video steaming service to watch episodes. If you need some inspiration for your outfit, watching some Hannah Montana episodes can help give you ideas. If you find a particular outfit you like, you can try to copy that outfit for your Hannah Montana look.

, If you're doing a Hannah Montana costume, carrying around a microphone can really help. Most costume shops will sell fake foam microphones you can add to your costume. Having a microphone on hand during a party can help signify to people that you're imitating the fictional pop star.If you don't have time to run to the costume store, you can easily make a fake microphone. Take a cardboard tube and glue a ball, such as a tennis ball, to the end. Then, paint the tennis ball and cardboard black.

, If you have long, blond hair, you already have the Hannah Montana hairstyle. Use a flat iron to straighten your hair before going out in your costume.Wash your hair with a volumizing shampoo before straightening it, and use a heat protectant on your hair. You can find these products at a local beauty salon. Make sure your hair is completely dry before you begin the straightening process.
Make sure you select a lower heat setting. Setting the heat too high could damage your hair.
Work with one section at a time. Move the flat iron from the root of your hair to the tip, moving slowly. Go over each strand only once.

, You may not have hair that can be easily turned into Hannah Montana hair. If this is the case, you can buy a large blond wig. In fact, this may be more realistic as Hannah Montana wore a wig in the series as her natural hair was brown. You can find a wig at a costume shop or buy one online.

, Add a scarf to your outfit. Hannah Montana is known for her girly, preppy attire, and scarves can really show this off. Go for a thin, sparkly scarf that you can tie around your neck for the party.You can find a lot of scarves by browsing the juniors section at a local department store.
Make sure to choose a bright colored scarf.

, You should also browse the juniors section for bright jewelry. Somewhat over-the-top jewelry can help you look like Hannah Montana. Opt for colorful, dangly earrings with a lot of sparkle and shine. You can also buy bright bracelets and necklaces.


Keep in mind dangly jewelry can be painful for some people. If the jewelry is causing your earlobes to become sore, it's a good idea to remove it. While earrings can help add flare to your costume, if you commit in other areas, you can still look like Hannah Montana.

, Hannah Montana did not wear a lot of makeup, but she was known for her eye shadow. She usually used somewhat neutral shades to match her skin tone. You can choose a shade to match your skin for a Hannah Montana look. However, sometimes Hannah Montana had more dramatic eye shadow.


A blue shade or a purple or pink shade can help with the Hannah Montana look. This may be particularly apt if you're going as Hannah Montana during a performance.Pick a series of colors so you can layer your eye shadow. You should not use a single color. At a drug store, you may be able to buy a shade of eye shadow with three separate sections: one for the lid, one for the corners, and one for the crease. However, you can also simply select three shades of a similar color that range from dark to light.

, Once you've chosen your eyeshadow, you can start to apply it. Start with your darkest shade and use a makeup brush, or the brush that came with the container, to gently dab that color along your eyelid.From there, apply your second lightest shade to your brow bone. This is the area of skin above your eyelid and just below your eyebrow. Lightly spread some lighter eyeshadow along your brow bone.
Take your lightest shade and apply it to the crease between your brow bone and lid. Then, spread a clean brush along your eyelid, crease, and brow bone to blend the colors together slightly.

, Hannah Montana did not wear a lot of makeup. Much of her makeup was toned down, so you do not need a bright lipstick. A neutral shade of lipstick, such as purplish shade similar to the natural color of your lips, will do. Simply run the tip of the lipstick along your lips until they are fully colored. It can help to rub your lips together when you're done, as this will blend the colors slightly., Once you've finished with your eye shadow, add a small amount of black eye liner. You can use liquid eye liner or pencil eyeliner. Make sure to only apply a small amount, as Hannah Montana was not known for her excessive makeup. All you need are a couple of thin lines outlining the lids of your eyes.Start with your upper lids. Draw a thin line of eyeliner running across the top of your eye, just above your eyelashes. Start near the pupil and slowly draw the line to the outer corner. Make sure to work slowly and carefully, as it's easy to smudge eye liner.
You can also draw a smaller line on your bottom lid, running about halfway through the bottom lid to the corner. You'll want this line to merge with the line on your upper lid.

, If you want more makeup, you can add a light layer of liquid or powder foundation. You can also dab some blush on the apples of your cheeks to brighten your face. However, this is strictly optional. Hannah Montana did not wear much makeup beyond eyeshadow, so this may not be necessary to get the look down.


If you opt for foundation, just focus on covering blemishes and smoothing over skin discolorations. Do not apply a heavy amount as you do not want the makeup to look caked on.

, Kate has dealt with bullies. She wasn’t always so desirable. She has talked openly about having braces as a child, for example.


The key to Kate’s vibe is that she stays true to who she is even in the face of critics. She doesn’t fit the stereotypical model’s body type, but she refuses to change to fit a stereotype.
Kate has spoken out about the fact that she is proud to be an example of a person who is comfortable in her own skin. Kate is said to be 141 pounds, but she is also 5 feet 10 inches tall."

Place a Batman figurine on top of the cake.",How to Make a Batman Cake," Whether you choose chocolate, vanilla, strawberry or red velvet, any flavor can be used in a Batman cake. If you're unsure, browse the baking aisle at your local grocery store for ideas.


You will need three boxes of cake mix and triple ingredients for this cake.;
, While you're still at the store, look at the instructions on the back of the cake mix box. The mix probably calls for ingredients such as eggs and vegetable oil. You will also need to purchase black fondant, yellow sugar paper and three cans of frosting.

, You will need five round cake pans for this recipe: three large, one medium and one small. Grease your pans to avoid cake sticking to them. You'll want to use about a half of tablespoon of butter or vegetable shortening on a paper towel to rub the inside of each pan. You can also sprinkle about a tablespoon or two of flour on top of the oil. By flouring the pans on the sides, the cake will better adhere to the sides as it bakes.


The best sized cake pans for this recipe are one 6-inch, one 8-inch and three 9-inch round pans.

, Once you have all the ingredients, you'll want to mix and bake the cake. The instructions are right on the back of the box. Make sure you preheat your oven to the suggested temperature.
Mix the ingredients and pour the batter into the greased cake pans.
Bake for the instructed time. The cakes are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Be sure to let them cool completely, preferably on a wire baking rack for 15 to 30 minutes.

, Run a butter knife around the pan edges to loosen the sides. Place the wire rack over the top of each pan, invert it, and tap it lightly to remove the cake.


For best results, stick the cooled cakes in the refrigerator or freezer until they are nice and cold.

, Spread frosting in between the layers. You can either use the same flavor of icing you choose for the outside of the cake or a different kind, whatever is your preference. , A crumb coat is a thin layer of frosting that prevents crumbs from getting into the final frosting decorations. , While it's not absolutely necessary, chilling the crumb coat makes it easier to apply your final frosting decorations.

, Cut an oval circle out of black fondant. Top it with a smaller oval circle of yellow sugar paper. Then just top the sugar paper with a fondant cut-out of the Batman logo.


Apply a little bit of frosting in between the logo layers so they stick together.

, Cut out various-sized rectangular shapes from the black fondant, no taller than the bottom cake layer. Then cut small squares of the yellow sugar paper to use as windows. You can space the windows around the ""buildings"" as you see fit.


Apply a dab of white icing to secure the windows to the buildings.

, If you cannot find the right color icing at the store, just buy two cans of white icing and dye it with blue or black food coloring. If possible, use a frosting knife to spread the icing as smooth as possible.

, While the icing is still sticky, attach the black fondant buildings around the perimeter of the bottom cake layer, ensuring they reach all the way around. Lightly press the fondant into the frosting until it sticks.

, Cut a long strip of black fondant equal to the circumference of the top layer, probably about 20 inches. Wrap the strip around the bottom edge of the top cake layer.

, Press the logo into the frosting on the front of the cake right above the black fondant ribbon.

, You can use any Batman action figure. Even better, place a toy Batmobile or a Robin action figure on top with Batman.

You have to have long hair, but not 70 feet (21.3 m).,
Rapunzel wore her hair in a beautiful whimsical braid in the movie, because she had to stop people from standing on it.,
Make sure you act like a princess.,

Be happy and cheerful.",How to Look Like Rapunzel from Tangled," Rapunzel's hair is long and blonde, it is what she is mostly known for. You can dye your hair if you like, but it isn't necessary. Just let your hair grow and take good care of it. Rapunzel's hair is always flawless. It glows when she sings, but putting glitter in your hair can seem fake, so let it shine with health instead!;
, So what you can do is take to sections of your hair in the front and French braid them loosely and put your hair in a big braid at the back of your head. Put flowers in it occasionally.

, Be kind to all people. Rapunzel, like most other Disney princesses, is very gentle and gracious. Due to her living isolated from the world all her life, she is incredibly innocent, almost naive.

Probably one of Jessica's most recognizable and iconic features is her long, fiery red hair.,
Jessica also has very long hair (about mid-back) with hardly any layers at all.,
When it comes to makeup, Jessica keeps it relatively natural apart from emphasis on the lips and eyes.,
Now, for Jessica's figure, it should be clear to you that no one can possibly hope to look like her exactly.,
Although Jessica is know for her iconic red dress, you can't walk about grocery shopping or attend your classes in a floor length sequin gown!,
You can imagine Jessica Rabbit smelling divine, can't you?,
If you want to go all-out, why not study Jessica's presence too.",How to Look Like Jessica Rabbit,"


You may dye your hair if you wish, but you must remember that she is a cartoon, and dyed-red hair often looks unnatural on normal people who are not born with it. However, if you can find a suitable colour, don't hold back: Jessica wouldn't be Jessica without those flaming locks, right?;
,


Normally, this look would be quite boring but to add the volume that Jessica sports, use rollers at the roots of your hair whilst drying to give them a lift. Not forgetting the famous front curl that falls over one eye. This adds great amounts of mystery and sex appeal, so pop a roller in a long piece of fringe if you have one. Remember to keep it smooth and styled so that it remains in place. Jessica's hair stays put and does not fall too far forwards into her face, this would make her look silly.

,


The lips are red but enough to suit her skin and hair tone. Go to a local beauty counter and ask an assistant to help you find one of the darkest red colour you can pull off. For the eyes, Jessica has a shade of smokey purple. Apply a similar colour to the edges of your eyes and into the outer socket to maintain the large 'cartoonish' eye. Too much shadow could close your eye in. Lastly, the eyebrows are very strong and defined. Don't change your eyebrow shape as this could lead to disastrous consequences, but keep them very neat and preened. Fill in the brow with the darkest eyebrow pencil or filler you can pull off.

,


If anyone was really made like that, they would fall over! Don't go through plastic surgery like some other Jessica fans have done. It is a permanent change and will you still want to look like Jessica Rabbit when at a respectable 60+? The decision is up to you, but this guide focuses more on the natural way to achieve her essence and style.
Investing in a good push-up bra, no matter what bra size you are, will greatly improve your confidence and resemblance to Jessica. If you wish, you can purchase chicken fillets to put in your bra to give them a bit more of a boost but try to remain true to what you've already got. Jessica is all about confidence in her own self; you should radiate this too!

,


Her style is very classy and glamorous. It takes practice to mix the two. You must feel like you are not exposing too much or too little skin, you must reveal a little but cover the rest with form-fitting clothes. Make sure that nothing is too tight; retaining elegance and class is essential. Wear clothing that is classic but will catch the eyes of those around you. Wearing low heels out and about will draw attention to your legs and give you a bit of height, a lowish-cut top will draw attention to there, nice fitting jeans will emphasize your body shape, etc.

,


Find a perfume that is sensual, with maybe a hint of floral tone. Make sure that it is not too girly but still has a sexy, feminine feel to it. Something mysterious and alluring would be perfect. Ask at your local perfume counter for some expert advice. It goes without saying that regular showers and personal hygiene should be meticulous.

,


As a character, Jessica Rabbit is very cool and collected and generally does not let small things sway her out of her comfort zone. Bend to problems and deal with them calmly. She would not be one to break down whenever an issue might arise. She is headstrong and knows what's best for her, and often does not let anyone tell her otherwise. This does not mean you must be stubborn and closed to advice, just stick to your morals!
Being a bimbo is just not very appealing. Clapping and giggling at the smallest of things will end up being rather irritating. Give yourself a sense of mystery; don't give yourself away to a stranger all at once. Allow them to come forwards to you. If you open yourself up in one go, they will not be tempted to dig deeper and find out more about you. This is one of Jessica's best tricks; mystery. Don't, however, become stuck up and seem like you don't want to be spoken to. Just keep them guessing!...

Wear black false eyelashes with lots of mascara.,
Apply red lipstick that matches your skin tone, clear lip gloss over top, and foundation.,
Dye your hair either black or dark brown, curl it, and get a flapper haircut.

Wear a short red dress, red heels, gold bangles, and hoop earrings.,
Wear sexy lingerie and corsets.

Be very sexy, sociable, very playful and a bit of a tease.",How to Look Like Betty Boop," Make sure they are good quality and that they look natural.;
, Don't wear any other makeup, aside from maybe some black liquid eyeliner on the top lid, but this is optional. Paint your nails bright red and grow them long.

,, Add in fishnet stockings, but stay away from the garter! It also helps if you're lucky enough to have a perfect, hourglass figure, although you don't have to have her exact shape, but do make sure you are in shape.

,, Also, be somewhat coy at times, it makes you seem cute.

"
Control your emotions.,
Be somewhat secretive.,
Be loyal and kind.,
Learn the fine art of sarcasm.,
Read, read, read.,
Look like her.,
Stay out of the sun.",How to Look and Act Like Raven from Teen Titans," Raven controls her emotions, so her powers don't destroy everything. Now, you most likely don't have telekinetic or empathic abilities, but it affects her demeanor more than anything else. So if you want to be like her you're going to have to control them as much as you can. Although let your emotions out sometimes, on very good occasions, or when you can't contain it let it out in a small smile and a hug.


Meditate. She's very in touch with her spiritual side. So, meditate. Close your eyes, sit in either a lotus or a cross legged position. (She is most seen doing this. If you're having issues doing these poses lay down in a comfortable position, your legs and arms not crossed) Make either a Shuni Mudra with your hands or a Surya Mudra. She's seen doing both. Look up what they both mean on Google. Relax your mind, don't let it wonder off into it's usual ""monkey minded"" state. Calm yourself. Eventually you'll be able to start visualizing things and doing things.. But for now, just do this. Research meditation, once you have this down and start meditating for at least 20 minutes a day.






Drink herbal teas. She has been seen in the Teen Titans episodes drinking a lot of herbal tea. I don't know if she does in the comic books, but I know for a fact she does this to calm herself in the TV show. In an episode of Teen Titans Go, she mentions that she drinks chamomile tea.






Write in a journal. This will help you solve your problems, and make you more introverted. Raven would never boast about her problems, or ask someone desperately trying to fix a situation because she couldn't handle it on her own. She solves things herself. It'll also help you not talk as much. Raven is extremely introverted and is more of an observer than anything. Dedicate to this and begin writing every day in it.






All these things will help you calm your mind, and control your emotions.

;
,


Most spiritual people are deep within themselves, and know to keep most of their things private. If you're young, your parents will probably think something's wrong. Tell them calmly that everything's okay, you just want to start keeping things more to yourself. Keep your room to yourself. Don't let people in it, unless necessary. Make your room dark, and mysterious. Put white or black candles in sets of three around the room. Have a large bookshelf with books in it as well. Stick to Dark blue, purple, and black colors.

,


Be loyal to those who are closest to you, and don't trust those that you don't know fully well. Distance yourself from them just a tad, and don't tell them everything. Do this slowly, but try not losing the friendship. Raven cares about her friends and family a lot.

, Sarcasm is your new best friend. Yes! Be sarcastic. Sarcasm usually comes with some degree of wisdom and years of knowledge and experiences. So, be smart about your sarcasm. Don't say things that have nothing to do with the topic.. Also be ironic, make ironic remarks on things that you find.. well... Ironic!

, Read as much as you can. Read spiritual books, books on the ancient religions. Books on symbols. Books on history. Books on math. I don't care. Just read. Be curious about things and build up your knowledge base. It'll help you with sarcasm, but it'll also open you up as a person. Raven would never be seen with a kindle so try reading just plain books. Put black covers on them if possible, and keep what you're reading to yourself. Never close your mind about things, no matter what religion you're in.

,


Now wearing a cloak and a long sleeved leotard might be a little much. In the comics she wears a long dress with a long piece in the front and back and a cloak. Save this for Halloween or a special spiritual occasion (depending on how much you got into the spiritual aspect of Raven). Sometimes she wears a simple short top with her stomach showing and a pair of nice jeans with a belt. In colder weather, she wears a fur-trimmed cloak, top, and boots in a matching color, with black leggings. She wears symbolic spiritual jewelry as well. Also, it's easier if you just get a nice blue hoodie, and a pair of jeans. It helps you fit in more and it still looks like Raven. When dressing like her and decorating, remember to stick to mostly dark colors. She's been known to say things about her ""affinity for a darker color scheme.""
Get purple or blue contacts. She's seen with having both eye colors so you have it easy if you have blue eyes. If you want to go purple then that's okay too.
Dye your hair dark if it isn't already, and/or get short purple hair. If you can't decide then you could just simply go with dark hair with some purple stripes.

, Wear sun protectant (won't make you paler, but it won't get you tanner) soak in baths of milk, oatmeal, lemon... etc. Other home remedies to make you paler safely.

When training in the Himalayas with a Zen warrior monk, he meditates outside in the bitter cold wearing little clothing and is able to control his body to the point that he melts the ice on which he sits.Some exercises you might try to improve your willpower:


Meditation
Setting and accomplishing deadlines
Tempting yourself and not giving in
Making and completing to-do lists;
, One of Batman's greatest skills in combat is is ability to out think his opponents. This can be observed in his battle with Dragon, a martial arts master of comparable ability to Batman, where the Dark Knight dispatched his foe without having to lift a finger.To gain more strategic ability, consider:


Playing chess
Taking up Go

Studying great generals in history
Taking part in team sports
Playing board games
Practicing with Real Time Strategy (RTS) games, Tactics differ from strategy in that tactics are the particular measures taken in combat while strategy is the overarching plan.Excellent use of tactics is displayed throughout the Bat's career.You can train your tactical skills through:


Playing chess
Taking a tactical response course
Playing a team sport
Playing paintball, One reason why the Dark Knight is so rarely bested by his adversaries is that he plans for every possibility. This is illustrated quite clearly by the Kryptonite he carries with him in case Superman turns against humanity.Develop your contingency planning by making a habit to think of every outcome possible for a conflict. Think carefully the location, your opponent, tools, and environmental factors, like rain. Now plan on how you will use these to your advantage, or counter these if used against you.

, While mastering his body and mind, Batman gained superb control over pain.Even when is back is broken by Bane, the caped crusader pushes through the pain to train with Lady Shiva to restore his physical abilities.To accomplish this goal, try:


Starting with something that makes you uncomfortable, like physical exercise, but only push out of your comfort zone a little bit. Never do something that could put you in physical harm; the goal of this exercise is to help build your tolerance through exposure.
Increasing the intensity of your training over time to push the upper limits of your tolerance.
Regarding your discomfort as a way of reaching your goals and smile through the pain., The only way that Batman could become one of the greatest, if not the greatest, martial artist in the DC Comics universe is through the dogged pursuit of his goals. Batman would go to any length within his code of honor to accomplish his goals - and for you to fight like him, you will need to as well.To do this:


Meditate on and evaluate your goals regularly.
Develop, and keep, a training regimen.
Test your abilities against recognized masters and experts.

, The reason Batman does not kill and does not use a gun is because he adheres to a strict personal code.A personal code is something only you can devise. Think about the principles that matter to you, where you draw the line between right and wrong, and ethical concerns, and use these to guide the formation of your code.

, To move with the speed of the Batman, and to respond to the violence of your enemies like him, you'll need your reflexes to be top notch. Use a speed bag, reaction ball, and a jumping rope to begin sharpening your reflex response., There are four main kinds of punches in boxing: jabs, crosses, hooks, and uppercuts. You can rest assured that Batman had perfect mastery of these techniques.A brief description of each strike follows:


Jab: executed most often with your weak, leading hand. These are intended to keep your opponent at a distance. Twist your arm and wrist in a quick snapping motion just before hitting your opponent for maximum effect.
Cross: a blow you deliver with your strong hand with a slightly upward motion that moves across the body.
Hook: a blow intended for either the head or body. You should bring your punch in on your opponent in a sweeping motion, from the side. This strike works well with combinations, but is susceptible to counters.
Uppercut: an upper blow from either hand to the head of your opponent. This punch is very effective in close quarters.

, When in a martial conflict, your footwork will determine whether you are ready to evade or strike and can be the deciding factor in your balance.Poor balance can put you off your guard, which may result in a battle ending not in your favor. Batman would never allow this, and neither should you. Some general tips on keeping good footwork:


Keep moving while engaged in combat.
Never cross one leg over the other (cross-step).
Keep on the balls of your feet and ready to move.

, Even a martial arts master like Batman will take a punch every now and then, or worse.In the event that an opponent proves too fast, too skilled, or too stealthy and gets off a punch, you'll need to:


Block with a limb, like your hand.
Parry with a strike of your own, like a short, quick blow to the forearm.
Tense your muscles before being hit.
Maintain your stance.
Move with the motion of the punch (""roll"" with the punch)., Bruce Wayne learned his Karate from an ""ascended"" master of the art while training in Korea.His master would be sure he knew all the basic stances. If you want to fight like the Dark Knight, so too should you. Two common stances are:


Natural stance (shizentai-dachi;自然体立ち): have your leading foot point forward and your following foot at a 45° angle. Your feet should be a approximately walking width apart.
Front stance (zenkutsu-dachi;前屈立ち): keep both your feet at a 45° angle to your line of approach, approximately walking width apart., The precise movements of Karate require tremendous balance and physical coordination. Batman developed this naturally over the course of his training.Spend time in each Karate stance you learn. Take into account stance weaknesses, your center of gravity, and any deepening of your stance or extension of your body that might improve your balance while in stance.

, You'll have to attain master level proficiency before you are able to claim you have equaled Batman in ability. But to begin with, you'll want to begin training:


The straight punch: from your stance, push off with your back foot toward your opponent, twisting your hips and shoulders as you do. Envision and aim at a spot beyond your opponent, punching through the space that he occupies for maximum delivery of force.The open-hand palm strike: keep your fingers together. You may curl your fingers slightly or adopt a straight finger shape. Push off with your back foot, aim beyond your opponent to strike through the space he occupies, and strike his body with the exact heel of your hand., In perfecting the various martial styles that he did over the years, Batman also learned various philosophies, including Tao, energy manipulation, and the use of shadows and stealth.To have mastered Karate, Batman would have also had to master its tenets. While you train, take note of:


The harmony and physiological balance expressed in Karate. Harmony between the parts of your self (heart, mind, body) is thought to lead to greater overall control.
The refinement of spirit attained through physical training. By exercising your mind and body in pursuit of martial excellence, you strengthen your will and learn the limitations of it.
The respect and courtesy required in the art. Every match begins and ends with a bow of respect to your opponent. This is termed reigi (礼儀) in Japanese, and is thought to promote harmony and humility., A gi (pronounced ""gee"") is a necessary part of training in Judo, and throughout Batman's backstory, he can be seen wearing this traditional martial arts garment. Once you have your gi, you'll be ready for action.

, The throws in Judo can be brutal if you do not fall correctly. Batman's ability to fight many opponents over a prolonged period of time, even after sustaining damage to himself, is proof of his mastery over this area of martial arts. There are many techniques you can employ to lessen the pain of being thrown, but in principle:


Do not fight the force of your opponent. Move with him, and try to allow the force to expend itself in motion, like through a ground roll. Relax while doing this, and exhale as you reach the point of shifting balance, when you can no longer resist and are in the process of being thrown., Many Judo bouts are decided on the mat, where groundwork proves its worth. These include various Batman favorites, like hold-downs, chokes, and joint locks.These should be studied with a suitable teacher at an accredited dojo (traditional training hall). Improper technique can result in injury for you and/or your training partner.

, As a known Judo expert, Batman would have learned the throws of this martial art inside and out.These throws can be dangerous if improperly executed. Practice your Judo throws at a proper facility, under the proper supervision. To perform the One Arm Shoulder Throw (ippon seoi nage; 一本 背負投), wait until:


An opponent grabs the front of your gi.
Cover his hand with your own and hold it in place.
Bring your free hand under the arm of your opponent and hook it under his arm at the armpit.
Twist your body to the opposite direction while still holding the hand on your gi.
Bend slightly at the knees in a balanced stance.
Use your back as a pivot and begin bending forward, leveraging your opponent with your arm beneath his armpit.
Bring your opponent across your back and launch him over your shoulder."

Stay in shape!",How to Look and Act Like Princess Ariel from the Little Mermaid," Ariel has long, beautiful red hair that turns heads, including Prince Eric's. Look for a shade of red that will complement your skin tone. If this is your first time coloring your hair red, get it done at a salon. Heat stylers can fade the color too, so stay away from those at all costs. Also, grow your hair long, at least a little bit past your shoulders. If you happen to be one of the rare natural redheads, then you have nothing to worry about.


Red hair tends to fade faster than other hair colors. Keep your color from fading by using products for colored hair. There are shampoos and conditioners on the market that are especially for bottle redheads. It's best to only shampoo once or twice a week to keep the color in. Try to avoid using heat styling products like curling or straightening irons, as well as direct sunlight and chlorinated pools.
If you don't want to dye your hair, you could try wigs, extensions, or semi-permanent hair coloring kits.
You don't have to dye your hair at all to be like Ariel.;
, Ariel is a natural beauty; therefore, she does not need a lot of makeup. If needed, use eyeliner on the top lashes only, drawing thin lines as close to the lashes as possible, or tight-line. Dust white eyeshadow/liner onto your waterline to make your eyes look bigger. Follow with a coat of mascara and finish it off with red lip color. If red though doesn't work on you, go for a rose-color! That's what Ariel sports in The Little Mermaid 3: Ariel's Beginning.

, Ariel does not sit around all day waiting for something fun to do. She's always out looking for the next adventure and living her life to the fullest. She is a daredevil and is never afraid to try new things. Do the same by always keeping your agenda open to new experiences. Spend time doing things you enjoy, just like Ariel, who's always singing, laughing, collecting treasures, and looking for adventure.

, Like her mother, Queen Athena, Ariel has a passion for music and was blessed with a beautiful singing voice. Listen to as much music as possible and know your favorite bands or singers. Also, be open to new ones, giving every one of them a chance. Sing along and dance with friends. Listen to it when you're just hanging out in your bedroom, while cleaning the house, or sleeping. If you're eighteen or over, go out to clubs and dance your butt off. Sing along with friends in the car. Go to concerts whenever you can. If you want, you can learn to play a musical instrument if you don't already play one.

, Ariel likes to collect interesting things that were left over from humans. If you want, you can do something similar by collecting antiques.

, Ariel has a lot of questions about the human world and wants answers. You can do the same by researching any topics that you're curious about and learn as much as you can about them! Google is a great place to begin. Or you could look up books at your local library.

, When in love, she's very dreamy and hums to herself.

, Go after your dreams and ambitions. Ariel let nothing stop her from being with Prince Eric!

, Ariel saved Prince Eric from drowning, after all.

, Ariel can act a bit shy, but she's still a flirt. So the next time you talk to your crush, subtly bat your eyelashes and smile. Ariel would also twirl her hair!

, Ariel has a great body. Don't idealize her though; she's animated so it's physically impossible to achieve her figure. She's very curvy with her tiny waist and wrists, decent bust, wide hips and slender legs, so don't starve yourself. Instead, work out regularly - about three times a week, go running, do crunches, an always remember, drink water!

Although Aurora is blonde, it doesn't require you to dye your hair blonde to be like her. Take your own, natural, beautiful hair color and work with it. If you're a brunette or a ginger and you think you have dull hair, get your hair colored, it'll look fantastic! For that summery hair look, try sun lighteners! You could start by taking as many chunks or small strands from your hair as you want, spray them on with a spray on hair lightener, such as Sun-In, and leave it on out in the sun, long enough for them to lighten into sun-kissed streaks. Don't forget to use a good conditioner right after and rinse with cold water to make it shine.
Aurora has quite a bit of hair, so, if you are interested in having those classic long locks, but don't have them yourself, hair extensions are a great way to go. If you have shorter hair, then flatter it! Short hair curled always is a beautiful, classy look.;
, In the film, Aurora has a classy, minimal amount of makeup on. A sheer red or pink lip stain, mascara, and possibly some foundation or eyeliner will work great. Lips are important, for Aurora is said to have lips that shame the reddest rose. For a more daring lip color, trace your lips with a matching lip pencil to define the lips and prevent your lipstick from bleeding. Lightly sweep some translucent powder over it to make it last longer. Matte lipsticks are best for their long lasting power.

, Flowing skirts, flowy blouses paired with figure-flattering vests, thick headbands, bows, pastels, floral sweaters and such are all options. Aurora is very connected with nature, so earthy accessories is also recommended.

, Aurora has a talent for singing. You don't have to be born with a set of excellent wind pipes to do this but at least try. Do it little by little each day. It's okay if you rather do it whenever you're alone. If you want, you can take singing lessons or join the chorus in a church. Sing your favorite songs or whatever comes to mind! She has an operatic style, so practice your head voice!

, This means to carry yourself with grace, elegance, kindness, and poise. Always be polite to others. Don't be rude, lash out of anger, or curse. Have a gentle, caring voice and a lot of patience for everyone. Be friendly! Be sure to still have a great time around your friends and to have a good sense of humor as well. Stand up for yourself if necessary, but know how to handle it maturely. For example, ask to be excused before leaving the table when eating at a restaurant or dinner party with a group of people.

, Believe that if you dream of something more than once, it is sure to come true. So, follow your dreams and believe in their coming true!

, Every princess needs a ""Prince Charming""! He doesn't have to be the ""hottest dude"" around, but at least he needs to be good to you and treat you right. Aurora's happiness lies in her being with Prince Phillip, the stranger she met in the woods.

, Aurora loves them all!

, Aurora is ever stimulated in life and eager to learn new things.

, Aurora is always dreaming about her prince, and even if you don't have a prince yet, always be optimistic and follow your heart., Use sophisticated vocabulary and talk gently and be articulate. People will respect the way you speak your mind."

Guys and Girls: Make yourself a set of wings.,
Think about your footwear, you can really do whatever you like, for guys I would suggest white trainers and girls some metallic/green/purple heels.,
You may also want to think about Buzz Lightyear himself, there are many features on his costume such as the gloves, helmet, buttons etc which you may choose to have or not.,
Now for the costume.,
Makeup.",How to Dress Like Buzz Lightyear," You can do this by cutting out a length of cardboard about the length of your arm and then painting it purple, but don't forget to leave space along the top and sides for red and white stripes across the top and green down the sides. Then fold it in half and attach some straps, these can be anything from two pieces of duct tape taped together or some random pieces of string /ribbon.
, If you can afford Silver Ugg Boots then go for them. Moon boots would also be a good alternative. If all else fails buy some cheap ugg-like boots and cover them in tin foil., for glove you could just buy a pair of coloured gloves cheaply in white, purple or green. You could maybe even try to make some yourself, they do not need to be the same as Buzz's, you don't even need them, it might just add to your outfit. You could even make them out of a pair of old long white socks and cut 5 holes in the toe for your fingers. For a helmet you could use an old bike helmet then customize it how you wish. The buttons can just be added onto your costume out of cardboard or felt - its as simple as that., There are many different options for the costume, for guys you could wear white trackies and a white t-shirt, then make a cardboard cutout of the chest and back panels. You can do this by measuring your upper chest and shoulders, and the upper part of your back, don't forget to leave a lot of space for the head to fit through. You can add the buttons appropriately, just look up 'Buzz Lightyear' on Google Images. Wearing a purple hat could also add to the look. For girls there are other options: a dress look with tights or they could go for the guy look. For the dress buy a large white t-shirt from a cheap store. Cut off the sleeves. It may help to be handy with a needle and thread, I've seen a wonderful Buzz Lightyear outfit that was fashionable and feasible, consisting of shoulder pads and a body-con dress in the appropriate colours, and sewed together with some extra bits here and there for the full effect. With the large white t-shirt you can choose to fit it to your body shape or just to leave it box-like. You could add cardboard green shoulder pads and buttons. You can then make the body panel like the guy's or just sew onto it for a more fitted outfit. It depends if your going for the fashionable or the structured look. You can then add some tights, in either purple or white, personally I think the purple looks better on this look., For guys you can add the spiral goatee. For girls complete your look add some fluttery eyes with eyeshadows in green and purple. Glitter also looks good in liquid eyeliners and then thick black/ purple mascara. You could even do your nails purple, green or white."

Believe in yourself.",How to Look and Act Like a Starlet," Stand in front of your mirror and say ""I'm beautiful, smart and sassy"" five times out loud while looking at yourself (even if you hear your parents laughing, or your brother says you look like a loser doing this). You have to understand that you are beautiful (because every woman is in their own way) - and you've gotta feel like a starlet before you can act like one!;
, A lot of the time, having confidence in your appearance comes with knowing that you've done all you can to make yourself look as good as possible. Do you have to be super-skinny to look beautiful? No! But a little effort can make you feel truckloads better about yourself (and people always notice a person's energy and vitality), so stop moping and get moving! You can play Dance Dance Revolution if you have it - or join a dance class. (Salsa or belly dancing, anyone?) You can go jogging around your neighborhood while listening to tunes on your MP3 player, or even join a gym with some girlfriends. It also pays to eat healthier. In the cafeteria, instead of a greasy piece of pizza, grab healthier food such as a turkey burger. Instead of soda, grab fruit juice or mineral water. For snacks, ditch those chips and try delicious (and way healthier) fruits. Those little changes can make big differences to the way you feel and see yourself!

, Nothing says more about a girl's self-worth than how she looks after her skin. Regular cleansing and moisturizing should be the cornerstones of any girl's skincare regime - and weekly exfoliation and masks don't hurt, either. Always wear some kind of sunblock (at least SPF 15 and one that blocks both UVA and UVB rays) to prevent uneven pigmentation and freckles/sunspots. Never trade your beautiful skin for a bronzed hue done via a solarium - alabaster-white or porcelain skin is just as gorgeous as darker shades of caramel and olive, only in different ways!

, let's get to the more exciting parts:

, Sexy underwear makes a woman feel, well, sexy. It's a fact that all starlets are aware of. Well, nobody would notice them unless you are in school and you are changing in the locker room, but it does help to boost a woman's self-confidence. (Most of us can do with a little extra something!) Imagine flirting with your hot coworker whilst wearing a pair of ivory granny knickers. Not exactly a great confidence-booster. On the other hand, if you're wearing a pair of slinky, lacy black hipsters by Victoria's Secret.... see the difference?, When it comes to makeup, starlets often wear sheer, natural makeup that play up their best features. If you are unsure, makeup counters at good department stores often offer sound advice - and you can even ask for a demonstration! Can't be bothered? One can never go wrong with a little foundation to smooth out your skin tone; curled lashes; mascara; eyeliner on the top lash line; clear or pink lip gloss, and a touch of blush on the apples of your cheekbones. (Of course, make sure that the foundation matches your skin tone - you don't want a ghostly face or an orange one now, do you?)

, Many people love French manicures, because they go with everything. However, long French nails can look tacky - and if you closely examine fashion magazines, you'll see that celebrities often forgo these, and instead prefer short nails in red, black, pink or nude. Starlets are working girls, you gotta remember. You don't want people to think you're a do-nothing who just primps and preens herself all day long, so lose the flimsy nails and get a manicure that's cute and practical - totally worthy of a starlet! (Check the tips section for a general guide to doing your own nails.)

, The key here is to play up what you've got. Curly hair can be played up to your advantage - and as long as you keep those frizzies away, it can be hot! The same can be said for poker-straight hair and kinky waves. Whatever your natural hair texture and colour, make sure you a) get haircuts that complement your face shape and hair texture, b) take good care of your hair by using mild shampoos and the occasional hair mask or conditioner, and c) get regular trims to keep split-ends at bay, and your hairstyle looking healthy and fresh. A tip: there are a large variety of hair products to add volume, shine and whatnot - but whatever you do, don't overdo it! It will make weigh your hair down and make it look more like a sad mop than a mane of glossy, flick-worthy locks, which is what we are aiming for.

, Red-carpet looks don't have to be expensive, or even particularly trendy. A wardrobe worthy of a red-carpet event is comprised of clothes, shoes and accessories that a) suit your body type and look good on you, b) reflect the kind of person you want to portray yourself to be, and c) make you feel like a star. Starlets always have to-die-for clothes (which are, a lot of the time, designer brands), but we have to remember that these girls have personal stylists - not to mention that they score many of those designer clothes for FREE. Since we're not Hollywood stars, we have to make do with what we've got. If you're on a budget, try going to Forever 21, Target, H&M, or if you are young, then Aeropostale and Old Navy. All of those stores mentioned above have very fashionable (and pretty good quality) clothing, shoes and accessories. Be creative, and be yourself!

, A true starlet needs a statement bag - and it doesn't need to be Hermes or Fendi! You can buy inexpensive (and adorable!) bags from stores like JCPenney and Dillard's, but you can virtually buy cute handbags from almost any store depending on your own personal style. Don't get caught up in the hype and buy cheap knock-offs if you can't afford the real thing. Starlets would rather cart around a no-label bag than one of those. And if you need an incentive, remember this - the production of fake designer items often involve child labor, so the cute Louis Vuitton knockoff hanging on the shelf may actually have been pieced together by a five year-old. Sad, much?

, How to act like a starlet? Read on., No matter how glammed up you get, there's always something about swearing that messes up the perfect picture just a little. Lose the swearing! It's tacky and downgrades other people's opinion of you. If you have to swear, reserve it for when you're not in public, and don't yell it out for everyone in the vicinity to hear.

, Starlets don't judge other people, because they've been judged enough by people to know it's unfair to do that to others. Don't be prejudiced against others, and try to be genuinely kind to everyone you come across even if they don't deserve it. (Within reason - sometimes you need to stand up for yourself or for other people.) It's not easy - but being a starlet means you have to learn to control your emotions and project a classy image even if it's not always convenient.

, Some celebrities may make drugs, sleeping around, alcohol, wild-partying and cigarettes look glamorous and very 'in', but this is as far from the truth as you can get. If anything, it makes you look cheap and nasty - not to mention it wrecks havoc on your skin, body, mind and soul! True starlets stick to their values, and would never do something just because everyone says it's cool. They lead the crowd, they don't follow it!

, Guys may like the dumb-blonde act, but starlets never do anything just to please guys! Intelligence is a virtue, and don't let anything convince you otherwise. Beauty and brains? A match made in heaven!

, Starlets don't always party or go to nightclubs. (Or at least, that's not all that they do.) True starlets, those who are worthy of carrying the name, help other people. They volunteer; donate their money to charity; attract media attention to the places and people that need them; actively fight for or support good causes. That's what makes them shine, not those super-expensive dresses! Well, if they can make a difference, then why can't you? You don't have to start a foundation. There are some easy things you can do, like donate your hair for charity (for more information, go to locksoflove.com), buy cosmetics from animal-friendly lines such as Hard Candy and Bonne Bell, support our troops (give $25 to USO and a soldier will get a prepaid phone card to call his/her family in the US - more info @ uso.org), donate canned foods to your local food bank, things like that. There are heaps of ways to help and make a change, so take the first step and do it!

, Have you noticed that starlets are always confident? They don't care about what their anti-fans or those crazed Hollywood gossip blogs and magazines have to say about them, and they don't care if anyone gives them mean comments about their looks. Don't hide behind your hair. Show your beautiful face! Hold your chin up high (but not TOO high), and sit up straight. Pull your shoulders back and walk like you're worth a million dollars, because you are. Believe in yourself and your abilities. Be confident. If you are not confident, then fake it. When others start believing it, you will too!

Wear a Black Jump Suit.,

Have a nice, sexy Belt.,
Have some good Bracelets.,
'Arm' yourself.,
Style your Hair.,
Wear the right Civilian clothes.",How to Dress Like Marvel's Black Widow (Natasha Romanov)," This forms the majority of Black Widow's outfit. It has a V shaped neckline, long sleeves and is tight fitting. In the comic books this is made out of a PVC-type fabric, but I wouldn't recommend trying to find one online - try looking out for more cotton based ones, spandex at a push. If in doubt, use plain black leggings, and a zip up, plain black, long sleeved jacket.;
, Black Widow wears a S.H.I.E.L.D eagle patch on both upper arms of her jump suit - these can be found online.

, If you want something taller, try black wedge trainers, or black boots with a heel - avoid anything taller than 4"", and stiletto heels.

, In the comic books, Black Widow wears a belt around her hips made of a series of gold disks, the center one having an hourglass engraved into it. In the films, she wears two belts made of black webbing. The bottom one, around her hips, is attached to two gun holsters on her thighs, and the top one has a red hourglass buckle, with black utility pouches.

, She wears 'Widow Makers' on both of her wrists - her main weapon. These bracelets can deliver a fatal electric charge. You may have to make them - you can get cheap strings of fake plastic bullets from fancy dress shops, to go with military outfits. Often the bullets can be unclipped from each other. Unclip two sections big enough to go around your wrist , and use black (for the film) or gold(for the comic books) paint to colour them. If you can't find the bullets, make your own by rolling up strips of paper, roughly two inches wide, and long enough to make a bullet shape. Use elastic tread and a needle to fasten them together after they've been painted.

, Aside from her Widow Makers, Black Widow tends to favor pistols over larger guns. Look up some fancy dress shops - most fake guns will not be black, so you may need to paint them.

, Black Widow's hair has a slight curl to it, and is naturally dark red. Use overnight rollers, or a curling iron, and a wash-in-wash-out dye if you need to.

, While posing undercover as Tony Stark's assistant, Natasha favors plain dresses, with short sleeves and knee length, straight skirts with black high heels. At the end of Avengers, we see her in combat boots, dark skinny jeans, a red t-shirt, black sweater and a brown leather jacket.

Wear an orange beanie.,

Wear black boots.",How to Dress Up As Spinelli from Recess1," Spinelli is always caught wearing her orange beanie. Find an orange beanie laying around or you can buy one from a local clothing store.;
, Spinelli wears a red dress in the show. To mimic her dress you can either wear a red dress or a red shirt that is too big for you. If you decide to wear a dress avoid wearing a girly one since Spinelli isn't all about that.

, Find a pair of tights from an old costume or you can buy a pair at your local clothing store. If you're not into wearing tight wear pants instead and if you can find the proper tights use black fabric paint on orange tights or pants to create stripes.

, Spinelli often wore a leather jacket making her look tough and intimidating. Any faux leather jacket will do just make sure it's black.

, Find a pair of plain black boots making sure they don't look too girly or fancy.

, Greens, purples, and almost EVERY shade of blue!

, If it doesn't work with your shape, Ariel still wears gowns that cinch in at the waist for a flattering figure.

, Shell jewelry is fantastic. Also, sailor knots on a top or a rope belt can suggest the ocean as well.

, This can be achieved with long, layered hair washed and towel-dried. Apply a wave-enhancing creme and let dry. Hair should be worn full and down, as if you had gotten back from the beach.

, Take good care of your toenails and feet, just as Ariel would- they're too precious to mistreat!

, Wear concealer, top eyeliner, mascara, white eyeliner on your waterline and natural red lip color at most. In the nighttime, feel free to experiment with different looks and colors!

, Spinelli has straight hair but that being said you don't have to straighten your hair to look like her. If you do decide to straighten your hair use a heat protectant to prevent split ends.

, Use a temporary hair dye or spray dye to get Spinelli's hair again you don't need to dye your hair black but you will look more like her if you do.

Watch the film and read the book for a better grasp of Leslie Burke's character.,
Be happy-go-lucky.,
Read plenty of fantasy books to fuel your imagination, and to inspire your creative writing skills.,
Learn to be fantastic at running.,
Find one good friend.,
Create your own magical fantasy kingdom.,
Acquire a unique sense of fashion.,
Express tomboy behavior.",How to Imitate Leslie Burke," Take notes on anything from her fashion to the way she uses language. Afterward, sit down and read through your notes. Contemplate about how Leslie would behave every day.;
, Leslie has a very positive outlook on life and seems to always have a smile on her face, and a twinkle in her eye. Surround yourself with optimistic people like herself and this will help you maintain that happy attitude. Don't be in any hurry to grow up. Keep your inner kid alive!

, Practice writing imaginative things in your own time, or for school. Over time, you will begin to see this skill grow.

, Leslie is an outstanding runner; in the book, her run is described as beautiful. At her school, Larkcreek Elementary School, she took part in a running race and won against all the boys in her grade. Practice running everyday. In doing this, running should gradually become natural.

, Even though Leslie was the new student at Lark Creek Elementary School, she still managed to make herself a friend- Jess Aarons, her best and only friend, and also her next door neighbor.

, Jess, Leslie, and her dog Prince Terrain (a gift from Jess) would run down to the back of their properties into the woods everyday, where Leslie invented the magical fantasy kingdom of Terabithia. In Terabithia, Jess and Leslie would reign as king and queen. They would both swing across a creek on an enchanted rope to enter Terabithia, and they would play in an old tree-hut (aka- the Terabithia Castle Stronghold). Leslie dreamed up all sorts of mythical creatures. It was all imaginary of course, but in Leslie's mind it was quite real. The next time you and your best friend are hanging out, at school or at your house, try finding a special place to create your own imaginary world with a cool title. Just make it up as you go, like Leslie did. All the imagining will become easier the more you do it.

, When it comes to fashion, Leslie is all about originality. She loves to layer colorful clothes. There's no need for you to purchase a new wardrobe- simply work with what you have in your closet. Try layering a colorful print tee over a long-sleeve top, or capri pants and knee-high socks. You can go D.I.Y with these ideas, too. Got an old pair of canvas Converse sneakers? Decorate them with ribbons and jewels! What about a long-sleeve top with a print on it you love, but can't wear in summer? Chop the arms off and you have yourself a new tank top! Be creative; Leslie was all about being an original.

, When Jess first met Leslie Burke, he was surprised that Leslie wasn't one of those girly-girls. Surprisingly, she was a true tomboy. Try participating in more activities a boy would usually do. Climb trees! Participate in sports! Don't be afraid to show off a tomboyish demeanor!

Don't judge right away!,
Get that Lily personality!,
Don't overdo your make up!,
Get the Lily look!,
Don't forget to be yourself!",How to Emulate Lily Evans," From what we know about Lily Evans she didn't judge people from what they looked like, and she could see good things in people that other people couldn't, as we have learned from Remus Lupin. So if there is someone at your school for example, that seems kinda lonely, try to get to know them. If you are too shy for this, have no fear! If they don't seem to wanna talk, you could just shrug and say that they can always come and talk to you if they want/need to.;
, We might not know many details about Lily's personality, but from what we've heard from various characters, she was open minded, incredibly kind, and was a good student. However, she did not tolerate bullying and had no problem standing up for herself! When James bullied Sev, she showed no fear, but walked right up to them, and told James to stop. Although, she could be rather sensitive. She got really, really sad when Sev called her a ""mudblood"". Understandable, the guy was her best friend, but still. She tried not to think about it too much though, and tried to stay positive even in harsh situations.

, Lily seemed to be the kind of girl that liked to show her natural beauty. So skip all those products that you may use right now, and show the world that pretty face of yours as it was meant to be! I'm not saying that you shall skip make up entirely, just don't overdo it. Put on some natural coloured eyeshadow, some mascara and if you'd like, some light blush. It's definitely enough!

, We all know that Lily had that beautiful, ginger hair. She also had olive green eyes that Harry later inherited when he was born. If you don't want to, or are not allowed to completely dye your hair red, get highlights if you can, but only if you want to. As for the eyes, I think it's uncomfortable to wear contacts, so skip them if you don't like the thought of wearing contacts!

, Lily is perfect as a role model, and I'm trying to think like her in various situations, but it's also important not to loose yourself!

You don't have to dye your hair blonde if you don't want to – try wearing it like she does. She lets hers hang loose, then rakes her hand through it for volume. Towards the end, she wears it in a ponytail.;
, Cher's father is super-rich and she has amazing things. You don't need to get your parents to buy you a masseuse or anything, but you'll need to try harder than cheap things.

,, Cher, for school, looks super-neutral. Foundation if you need it because Cher has flawless skin, a little mascara and you're done, really. But draw attention to your lips. Use lipstick and plain, non-sparkly colours because Cher is super classy. A nice pink or pale pink colour will be pretty, or for nights out, bright red.

, Cher is a '90's girl and shows it. Wear white blouses, with either a shiny miniskirt or pencil skirt and black heels, or a white blouse with a skirt suit, so a matching jacket and skirt. Cher's not much of a jeans person.

, For nights out, dresses! Darker, classy colours like maroon, indigo and deep red will look nice, or just a white or black dress.

, She also has checked pyjamas.

, Have one best friend who stands by you through everything – your personal Dionne. Have other friends, but make sure they're cool and popular – and know that you are too.

, Cher didn't get friends by being obnoxious. Be a good friend – if a buddy goes through a break-up or something, take them shopping! Buy them ice-cream! Be sweet and mature.

, Cher likes cartoons.

, Clueless is a comedy.

, People may find you a poser.

Wear a belt, but only as a fashion accessory!",How to Dress Like the Olsen Twins3," A lot of bracelets and bangles are a must have and adds a bit of a twist to the look. Long necklaces and natural beads or shells are nice too. Earrings aren't that great, however dangling earrings have been making an appearance lately. Rings are also good, but again they have to be over-sized and natural colours.

,, Over-sized obviously, which must include;


Phone
iPod
Keys,
Over-sized sunglasses
Purse
Bottle of vitamin water

, Belts are rarely worn, but if so, waist belts or hip belts of brown and black colours only and only ever used as a fashion statement.

Start with your hair.,
Moisturize and cleanse your skin daily, exfoliate twice a week, and use a toner once every one or two days to keep your skin as clean and fresh as Emma's.

,
Emma's makeup is pretty simple, so your makeup should be too.,
Emma's clothes are sexy and sometimes provocative.",How to Get Emma Stone's Sexy Look in Easy A," Emma curls her hair in loose, long ringlet curls throughout the movie. To do this, you need to curl your hair with a straightener or a curling iron. Put your hair into two sections, tie one half back with an elastic, and curl one side of your hair at a time. Be careful not to make the curls too tight, because Emma's are loose. She also has a side bang, so ask your stylist to cut your hair in that way if you want to look exactly like Emma.;
,, You can try a simple black, grey, and white smokey eye with a thin line of black eyeliner on your lower lash line. Apply white eyeshadow in the corner of your eye to brighten your eyes and make them look bigger. For lips, use a light, shiny gloss. Use a liquid foundation that provides light coverage and make sure it matches your skin tone. Over that, apply a light powder foundation for a flawless look.

, Look for tight, dark jeggings or skinny jeans. You'll also need several pairs of heels, in black, red, and other colours. Emma wears tops that are similar to corsets or lingerie, so look for tops that look like corsets or even wear lingerie as a shirt. Go to stores that specialize in or carry club wear for a variety of options with clothing. Always carry a pair of large, dark sunglasses and a purse.

, Petra was described as being so tough and boyish that they had to check her DNA. Don't let those nasty girls pressure you into wearing short shorts and high heels. If you wear shorts, make sure they're Bermuda shorts, or they go down to at least mid-thigh.

, Petra always has a comeback on hand, and she isn't afraid to offend anyone in her frankness. Don't go overboard on the insults, but always have one at the ready when a mean girl approaches you.

, Petra is always above people, and she isn't afraid to show off. Show off your skills at every chance you get, and don't be afraid if you lose.

, If you aren't already, start learning. You can't be arrogant if you have nothing to brag about. Always practice strategic games. Go join the local chess or book club.

, If not in a good way. People were always teasing Petra for her faults, but she kept her head high and walked right through it, knowing the nastiness was just jealousy. You do the same. Don't be one of those annoying kids that say to everyone who is mean though, ""That was a compliment to me!"" That will just sound stupid.

, If you aren't and can't change that, don't be ashamed of it. Petra never was. When she was back on Earth, she couldn't run and always came in last, but she still loved exercise. Be proud of yourself.

Decide which version of Erik you want to dress up as.,
Get the proper attire.,
Find a long, black cape that looks like your version of Erik's cape.,
Find a white half mask (or a whole one) that looks like your version of Erik's mask.,
Find some black dress shoes that look like the ones that your version of Erik's.,
Get some black gloves (Any type of glove will do except for hand knitted, or hand crocheted.,
If desired, you can put make up on the side where the mask will be placed to look like your version of Erik's deformed face.,
Put on the whole outfit and enjoy!

",How to Dress up As Erik (the Phantom) from the Phantom of the Opera," There are several versions you can choose from. Some of them include the movie version, Broadway version, book version, etc... If you don't know what each look looks like, then Google ""Erik from the Phantom of the Opera"", and click Images. For example: Erik from the Phantom of the Opera, Broadway version"";
, Once you have decided which version of Erik you wish to dress up as, then find a black dress coat, black dress pants, and a white dress shirt that looks like what your version of Erik is wearing.

, You can find a black cape at a thrift store, Party City, or at any other Halloween store. If you prefer to make your cape, you can also do that as well. A good place to find materials to make your cape is a fabric store, or, you may be able to improvise with some old velvet curtains.

, You can also make a white half mask for a lot less trouble depending on how much time you have. To do that, you must first find a white full mask with a rubber band along the back. (You can often find them at Michael's.) Then, carefully remove one end of the rubber band from the left side of the mask. Next, you cut the mask from left to right across the forehead to the bridge of the nose, around to the underside of the nose and continue down to the mouth, around it, and down to the chin. Finally, reattach the rubber band to the top of the mask with a stapler. You may need to use trial and error to make sure the mask will stay on your head.

, Again, you can find them at pretty much any thrift store for a good price.

, Gloves that are a leather type work well for any version of Erik that you are dressing up as. You can also find these at the thrift stores or, you can make them. If you can't afford leather gloves, you can also use ones that are made out of fabric. Example: Cotton, silk, ect...

, You can do this by using purplish make up to make your eye with the mask off look like it is messed up. You can use red and/or pink make up to make small circles that look like scabs. (You can put the ""scabs"" anywhere as long as the mask is hiding all of them!)

Don't look trashy.",How to Emulate Mike Teavee from Charlie & the Chocolate Factory," In the 2005 movie adaption, Mike Teavee is an obsessive gamer who plays video games non-stop. To be like him and for a plus, make sure you play some video games, too. Mike's video game style is violent, but if you are not one for violence, tone your gaming style to more action/adventure. Also, know your old games such as pac-man and Zelda. When playing, pretend that your attention is only on the game and nothing else. Occasionally, yell comments such as ""die!"" to your opponents whilst playing. Be serious.;
, Mike Teavee -- Mike T.V? Get it? I think so. Watch television! If you're looking to be like Mike, you have to watch TV. Watch actions/adventure films, or maybe some thriller.

, In the 2005 movie adaptation, Mike is shown to be extremely intelligent. Pay attention in school, especially in subjects such as Math and Science, which is the subjects that Mike would excel in. When explaining something that someone doesn't understand, roll your eyes as if it was the easiest thing to understand and make your explanation complicated. For example, say something like: ""all you had to do..."" and add: ""...even an idiot could figure it out.""

, Know your computers! Make sure you know all the codes and complicated details about the machines and latest gadgets. Show off this particular skill.

, Wear black skull t-shirts with red long sleeves underneath. Wear sneakers. Mike usually wears dark colours; try navy/dark blue, dark greens, greys, blacks, reds and purples.

, If you're a boy, spike your hair slightly. If you're a girl, wear your hair in a loose braid over your shoulder, or maybe a low ponytail. Mike isn't really one for fashion, so don't worry about it!

, When needed, raise a single eyebrow in certain situations. Use this when expressing a curious feeling, a concerned feeling, or maybe even a creeped out feeling. Fold your arms simultaneously (for an example, check the image in this article's introduction).

, Don't care about what other's think about you. Express your feelings, even if you have to lose your temper at times to make a point.

, Even if you don't, act the part. Don't act dumb. Mike knows exactly what he's doing. When explaining something, throw some facts if comparing (for example: ""...that'd be the equivalent to like five atomic bombs!"")

, Don't let anyone stand in your way. Know what you want and when you want it.

, This is best done in private. Find something to take your anger out on and really put your heart and soul into doing so.

, Know lots of things. Impress others with this.

, Be on time to class though, and always follow rules. If it violates what you believe in, stand up for it!

, Don't act like a nerd. Be really intelligent and smart, but remember, don't forget to look hot, hot, hot! This prevents you from being classified as the geek or nerd. Don't be afraid to spill your brains out, but make sure you also look super cool when doing it. If you are required to wear school uniform pop your collar up and leave it like that, roll your sleeves up and walk with style.

,, Keep your cool and don't look trashy.

Rock it with confidence.",How to Dress Like James Bond," Even if your tux costs you $2,000 for a night's rental and was worn by Christian Bale at the Batman premiere, if it doesn't fit, it doesn't work. This is primo to being Bond-esque. If you're wearing what clearly looks like someone else's suit, you're not owning the clothes.


Bond is all about refined manliness. The suit that you wear should give your torso a definite V shape, if at all possible. If you can, go to your tailor and get the button placed at the narrowest place on your waist. That will make those manly shoulders look as broad as possible.;
, If you have the druthers and ability to do so, find a suit that's made of the right stuff. You'll be best off with a material that's 9 to 11 oz in weight -- it's not so heavy that you'll be sweating even before the girls arrive and not so light that it loses its shape when you start taking down ninjas.You'll also want fabric that's Super 100-120 superfine wool or wool-blend. Anything too coarse and you won't be touched by the ladies and anything too fine and you'll feel the heat from that explosion you set off., As for color, you want to stick to black or at the most colorful, midnight blue (that's dark, dark blue). But black is your standard, is the safest, and is the most classic. Midnight blue might be used as dinner ensemble and that's about it.


Patterns are a no-no. A big no-no when it comes to jackets and trousers. You may have a faint pattern in your cummerbund or bow-tie, but that's it.

, You'd think this would be simple, but there's even detail to getting the white shirt right. You want a shirt that's clean, pressed, and not a button-down collar. Both single and double cuffs are okay, so long as they stick out just a twitch from beneath your suit jacket.


Daniel Craig is often found sporting a shirt with a high neck. This is a good look, but a lower neck is fine, too (Craig doesn't have the longest neck in the world).And speaking of the collar, it should either be point or wing., Alright, so you know what color, what material, and the general basics of what to look for when it comes to your suit. Now let's talk about the details:


Keep it single-breasted. It's easier to find and it just looks better.
Go no vent or double-vented. Just...do it.
Wear suspenders, not a belt. It's not dated, it's classy as all get out.
Wear a cummerbund or waistcoat. You want the transition from your pants to your shirt to be utterly seamless.
Shawl or peak lapels only. Again, just do it.A neatly-folded pocket square in either white or red (red if you're feeling frisky).Mother-of-pearl cufflinks or simple, basic, small silver studs.

, To complete the suit, you need the right shoe. You'll look best in a pair of shiny Oxfords that match your threads -- so black will clearly be the easiest choice. Just make sure they're not scuffed and you could start fires with them, they're so shiny.


Need more details? Okay, go for a basic, thin lace-up, with a thin leather sole and a defined heel.Think simple. Always simple.

, Dressing like Bond is not the time to bust out your velvet maroon fedora. He must remain classic and understated so his coolness takes the spotlight. There's nothing boring about a great tux or suit, so don't feel the need to ramp it up with color or patterns.


If you absolutely must show your creativity, mix up your pocket square, get a barely-there pattern on your cummerbund, or mix it up with a vibrant lining in your jacket.

, To be frank, dressing like Sean Connery in ""Diamonds are Forever"" is a much different look than dressing like Daniel Craig in ""Skyfall."" And let's not even touch George Lazenby in ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" However, there are options. Whether fashion likes it or not.


The casual look for each Bond is different. It could be a pair of khakis and a fitted sweater or the sports gear Pierce Brosnan donned in Goldeneye. However, if you want everyone to know you're 007, you'll probably want to go black tie.

, Again, while a Bubblegum pink suit may have been appropriate in '71, you'll be better off getting your point across if you stick to neutrals in this day and age. Think in blacks, greys, and tans.


Think Roger Moore in ""Moonraker."" A simple black shirt with nice pair of black trousers. Easy as pie, yet still refined and dressed to kill.

, Bond isn't super-human; he's still subject to hot and cold. When he's gallivanting on the beaches of Fiji, he can be spotted in lightweight, light-colored linens. If it's hotter than hell on the face of the sun, drop the jacket. You can still drink martinis.


In ""Skyfall,"" we see Daniel Craig in a peacoat. There's a touch of femininity to Bond that's somehow masculine. Don't be afraid to get trendy -- in this case, it's a very good thing.

, In Goldfinger, we saw Sean Connery in his baby blue swimwear. In Casino Royale, we see an homage to that with Daniel Craig's baby blue swim trunks. Not every Bond would rock the £125 swim trunks, though. What's the style of yours?


Clearly, Bond exists outside of his fine formal wear. You can still maintain your Bond-ness in any setting -- it just might take a prettier penny. And lots of ironing and dry-cleaning!

, You know those Axe commercials where the women get woken from their slumber and follow their noses to the nearest guy donning the cologne? That guys needs to be you. Use your signature scent, whatever it is. James Bond doesn't smell like garlic. Maybe vodka once in a while, but never anything other than that.


It should go without saying, but you need to be squeaky clean. Hop in that shower, lather up, rinse down and style your hair.

, You can keep your leg hair, but everything else needs to be...taken care of. You won't be tempting the ladies with a hobo beard, that's for sure. Nor a fu manchu 'stache. Hate to break it to you.


The entire thing needs to go. No sideburns, no pork chops, no five o'clock shadow. Clean, clean, clean. And the chest hair peeping out from underneath your collar? That too.

, Watches! You don't need high tech watches that can detonate bombs (though if you have one laying around, by all means!), just one with style, like Rolex or Omega. Just find a good watch. A watch with class.


As for socks, long and black. Find a good pair from a good store and buy them for the rest of your life. Remember: long and black. Short and white? NO. Long and black.
Have a holster on hand? Awesome. Shove that onto your side. No questions asked.

, If you're walking down the street, what does your shadow on the pavement look like? Are your pants the right length? Does everything come together at your middle, giving you a slight triangle shape? Are your sleeves not too long and not too short? We're not playing Goldilocks here!


All the parts need to be great on their own, but they also need to be great together. Take a look at your entire outfit once you've pieced it together. Does it seem to gel?

, Odds are you don't don a tux all too often. However, you gotta rock it like it's just a normal Tuesday. You know nothing besides Tom Ford and Brioni. This is what you wear when you're feeling down. This is what you wear when you want to convey indifference to the ladies. This is what you wear by yourself when you're watching the latest episode of ""Orange is the New Black."" This is nothing. All this effort? That just comes naturally to you.


A tux (or other fancy formal wear) will look odd if you don't feel comfortable. Odds are if you have a tux that fits well, you look awesome. So strut your stuff! After all, what would James Bond do?

Speak when words are needed, stay silent when they are not.,
If you go to school and have a school uniform, do not alter it.,
If you go to school, listen to your teacher(s).,
If you go to school, take your education seriously.,
Listen to the kind of modern music that Cosette would enjoy.",How to Emulate Cosette from Les Miserables," Take notice of Cosette. How does she speak? Try to adapt your way of speech to emulate Cosette's. Cosette takes a gentle and respectful tone with her ""father,"" Jean Valjean. She addresses him as ""papa."" Don't change what you call your father or male guardian if you already call him something else, but do try to address your parent(s) or guardian(s) respectfully.;
, Cosette is described as a ""burst of light"" by Marius. She is a ray of hope in the darkness, a paragon of virtue and purity. Growing up in a convent, Cosette was raised a Christian. If you are not Christian, don't pretend to be. Substitute God with your parents and respect them instead! Cosette is demure and lady-like, so copy this to the extent you can or want to. She is hopeful and content, so try to keep an optimistic view on life. Cosette is a polite young lady, respectful of others. She is curious and wistful. She is joyfully naive and very intelligent. She has a heart full of love and is a true romantic!

, Cosette is a sheltered and innocent girl, so to keep this innocence you may want to consider spending more time with adults and those who will protect you. Perhaps try to limit your exposure to anything crude or sexual. Stay honest and loving to any partners you have.

, Show them you love them through actions and affection towards them. Follow the family rules and stay out of trouble as much as you can. If you wish you could do little things to show them how much you care, such as write them a poem or make them a little card. Remember their birthday and go all out for mother's/father's day. Be obedient, but share your feelings and viewpoints with them. Communicate with them if you disagree with something they have said/done, but do so in a polite and respectful manner. Do not throw a temper tantrum or scream and shout as Cosette would not do that. However, remember you should not have to put up with cruelty towards you from adults - Cosette may have had to deal with the Thénardiers, but that doesn't mean you have to!

, Cosette is famed for her black dress with the white lace collar, so you could buy this. If you want to modernize it you can buy a knee-length one and you could style it with leggings or black jeans. For those of you who want the full Cosette look, dress like a 1832 female. Cosette is also famed for her long tresses, so try a longer hairstyle if you want. Her hair colour in the novel is dark chestnut brown, and in he musical/movie it is blond, but don't worry if yours is different. Embrace your natural hair colour, shape and style, or you could try dying it.

, Cosette likes to read. She also loved to play with her dolls as a young girl and she sings. Practise your singing! If you cannot sing, perhaps you could dance or learn an instrument. Try out some old-fashioned hobbies, such as baking, gardening (Cosette loves her garden), or jewellery-making. If you do not enjoy any of these, it doesn't matter too much so long as you embrace what you love.

, Respect your partner and treat them equally and lovingly.

, That sarcastic comment that has entered your mind, is it REALLY worth voicing? If you have nothing nice to say, say nothing. Do not give insincere compliments. Do not talk back to adults, they are your elders and should therefore be respected! Consider the consequences of your words. How will this affect those around you? Will it affect them in a positive or negative way? Be as nice, kind and well-meaning as you can be.

, You may wish to go with the more feminine uniform if you like (for instance wearing a skirt instead of trousers), although this is obviously not mandatory. You could add a nice headband or a single ring to add a touch of femininity.

, Avoid mixing with the ""bad"" crowd. Always do as you are told. Remember to remain demure and polite. If someone hits you, you should stand up for yourself, but never hit them back or act impolite. Be as respectful to your classmates as you would be towards anyone else.

, Do not give into temptation, boredom, or peer pressure.

, She'd listen to a lot of classical music and soft lyrical songs, but would avoid anything vulgar and sexual. Also listen to some of the Les Miserables Broadway soundtrack; this can offer greater insight into Cosette's character.

Work out.,
Carry yourself well.,
Get sleep.,
Use minimal makeup.,
Messy long hair is quite an asset.,
If you are biracial, work your individuality here!,
But never fear.,
Beyond the AA look, be more socially aware.,
Try to not look too put together.,
American Apparel models ooze a particular type of sexuality- the ongoing themes are about individualism, sensuality and approachable appeal.,
Smile.",How to Look Like an American Apparel Model," Not all the AA models are skinny. The trick is that while they have actual curves, they are healthy as well. Yoga, Pilates, cardio...whatever. Preferably something that lengthens and tones without adding too much bulk to your body. Try eating some healthy food. That means no soda, French fries, or twinkies. Believe me, it pays off.;
, Posture is important, and so is your general demeanor- try to be genuine and speak in an uncontrived and confident manner.

, Seriously- 8 hours will have you well on your way to looking youthful and fresh before you have even tried.

, Like the clothing at AA, the cosmetics are simply there. No fuss, no frills, yet a statement nonetheless, in an ironic sort of way. That means no caking on the bronzer, eyeliner, foundation, eyeshadow, mascara, etc. You can start by taking good care of your skin, and applying a primer. (GOSH have a great one). Next, try to use base only where you need it to even up, not cover up, your skintone. Generally, stay away from strongly pigmented products, and aim for a youthful sheen. Bright eyes can be enhanced with brown mascara and a dot of white highlighter on the inside corner. Keep lips nude and matt, or stick to a soft peach or pink stain. Keep eyebrows well groomed and strongly shaped. Just buy quality products, you won't need as many and they will provide the dewy, sensual look you are aiming for.

, Make it scrunchy, bed-heady. Don't straighten naturally curly or afro hair- and if you have flat hair which needs a little help, use your straightening irons, clamp sections of hair between them, and pull them downward while you zig zag them to create a kink. A quick tip is to mix up a little salt water, hairspray and lemon juice in a bottle, and give it a quick skoosh and scrunch. Wear it long and free, or pile it on your head. Try to not look neat or severe- your hair should frame your face and create delicate tendrils around your features.

, For instance, if you're Norwegian/Arabic, flaunt it! Biracial is simply beautiful. The uniqueness really sets off your beauty.

, If you are not biracial, find some unique feature (a mole, large nose, thick eyebrows) and draw attention to it rather than hiding it. Freckles, an individual smile, a square jawline and brightly coloured red hair are just some examples of the kind of beauty Apparel are looking for. Because AA is not about synthetic beauty.

, Find a cause and work for it. That's the biggest component of beauty. Don't be a wuss and follow something just because it's trendy. Tap into your passion and then go for it.

, Your clothes, including any Apparel you wear, don't have to match, but should rather convey your energy and originality. Try to pair pieces of vintage wear, reworked items, ebay finds and Apparel with high street brands, and show attention to detail in acccesories- don't overdo it.

, Thigh high socks, hotpants and skin tight mesh wear can look garish on some- but if your confidence is based more on inner beauty and your face and hair are kept undone and clean- you can pull it off. It's about showing off some parts and covering up others, wearing sensual and soft materials, exuding touchable and desirable qualities- you don't need fake tan or false eyelashes to achieve what you want here.

, It may or may not be in right now- but it's attractive to anyone, fashionable or otherwise.

Get the Agyness' crop.,
Collect vintage pieces.,
Adapt her makeup style.,
Accessorize like Agyness.",How to Look Like Agyness Deyn," Agyness is well known for her hair, a cute pixie crop bleached an ash blond. If you really want to go all out to achieve the Agnes look and you're feeling brave, then go for the chop as shown in these images. Spike it up sometimes, try a light forward ""faux hawk"" (Styling your hair into a Mohawk without actually shaving your head). To get this look, try some hair wax but make sure it's not too sticky, as this will make it harder. Try to avoid clear hair gels for this, as they will give you a wet look, whereas Agnes goes for the bed-head look.;
, Agnes clothing is eclectic. To copy her style, you can't go wrong with such clothing as braces, men's pants, bowler style hats, scarves, glasses, faded t-shirt and leather jackets. Try old style shoes and dresses worn with sneakers. Wear boyish clothes, but always team with something girlie. For instance, team a baggy boy's tee with skinny jeans; it's all about balance.

, Darken your eyebrows a little, even and perhaps especially, if your hair is bleach blond. Wear a little mascara and eyeliner and aim for a paler skin look. On occasions, try brighter lips with plainer clothes. Either a flawless face with a simple slick of liquid eyeliner, or a flawless face with red lipstick and no eye makeup. However, if you prefer wearing a fair amount of eyeshadow, take a look at her catwalk shows or clothes shoots for inspiration.

, If your outfits are looking a little bland after a while, accessorize with interesting objects. Maybe a guitar or an interesting vintage handbag. Also buy some union jack stickers and stick them on your guitar or transfer them onto clothes.

Mix up traditionally masculine and feminine looks.,
Wear heels and trainers.,
Combine baggy tops with tight bottoms.,
Wear a lot of denim and leather.",How to Look Like Cara Delevingne1," Cara's personal style ranges from very femme to almost butch, often in the same outfit. She's not afraid to wear trousers and suits to special events, even though she wears elegant dresses in equal measure. Pair a leather biker jacket with a flirty skirt and heels. Don't hesitate to wear beanies and baggy sweatshirts with skinny jeans and flawless makeup. A baseball cap over long hair and a floral dress? Very Cara., When dressing for a formal event, Cara has a penchant for slick, black ultra-high heels. In day-to-day life, however, she favors a wide variety of athletic shoes. She wears a range of brands and styles. While her collection features many different colors, she seems to prefer white sneakers., Cara generally favors this combination of fits. For tops, she loves baggy t-shirts, oversized varsity jackets, and billowing crop tops. She pairs these with skinny jeans, accentuating her trim, waifish looks., Cara's style takes a lot of its cues from 90s grunge and rock fashions. As such, she's often spotted in denim and leather both on and off the runway. Her outfits make heavy use of skinny jeans, denim shorts, and leather leggings. While she most often sports a black leather jacket, she occasionally trades it in for blue denim."

Look chic.,
Have a skin care routine.,
Wear natural make-up.,
Eat well and live well.,
Wear comfy clothing.,
Choose your jewelry carefully.,
Don't slouch.,
Have confidence in yourself.",How to Look Like a Model Off Duty," Off duty models look chic from head to toe, so let's start with the head: Hair should be clean and carefree. No high-maintenance styles, or super-polished looks. Try parting your hair down the middle and letting it dry naturally. Or, pull half away from your face and let some strands frame your face. If your hair is unmanageable, add a frizz serum or cream to help tame it. If it's raining, humid, or you didn't have time to wash it, a high, messy bun is a great option.;
, Models always have beautiful, clear skin... and you can too! Start with an exfoliating cleanser three times a week. In between, use an acne controlling cleanser. Apply a light moisturizer or BB cream (or tinted moisturizer) for daytime, (preferably with an SPF) and a thick, rich night cream right before bed. If your skin is oily, try applying an oil control cream to your T-zone, and only apply moisturizers under your eyes and wherever else needed. If you break out, get an acne cream or gel to help soothe pimples, and refrain from wearing heavy makeup.

, Models spend a lot of time in front of cameras and on runways, covered in makeup. Usually an off-duty model sports a natural look, to let the skin breathe. Try dabbing a bit of concealer under the eyes, a coat or two of mascara, and some lip balm. If you need or want more, experiment with soft eyeliners, bronzers, and blushes.

, It's a fact- most models are thin. If you want to look like one, try to get in the best shape you can be in. This does NOT mean stop eating or turning to bulimia or anorexia. This means eating well (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, etc.) and exercising. See the tips sections for snack ideas and exercises you can do right in your own home. For your skin, exfoliate in the shower three times a week and use a normal body wash in between. Slather on a nice, thick moisturizer right before bed. You will wake up with supple, soft skin! Another note: models ALWAYS protect their skin from the sun!

, Models spend a great deal of time wearing uncomfortable, possibly ill-fitting clothes. When they have some down time, they usually turn to basic, well-fitting staples. Think tank tops, camisoles, V-necks, off-the-shoulder tees and hoodies, skinny jeans, Capris, not-too-tight shorts, and flats. Chances are, you already have most of these in your closet! Tie a look of staples together with a boyfriend style cardigan, trench coat, or loose sweatshirt. Nothing too tight, high maintenance, or ill-fitting!

, Off duty models are rarely seen wearing huge, plastic, costume accessories. Pick a few signature pieces: a gemstone ring, pendant, and a few bangles are all you need. If you're wearing all solids and want to funk it up, add some cool, chunky jewelry... everything is okay in moderation - just don't overdo it.

, Off duty models stand out even wearing the most basic of clothing. If you are slouching or slumping, you will look like you're trying to hide. Stand tall, put your shoulders back, and hold your head high! It WILL make a difference! Walk down the hallways of school or your workplace like it's a runway... work it!

, The trick to looking awesome is LOVING yourself! Look in the mirror and write down 5-10 things you like. Do you like your hair color? Is it thick and lush? Do you have beautifully colored eyes? Do you like your eye shape? High cheekbones? Clear skin? A strong nose? Soft skin? A nice figure? Pick out what makes you unique, embrace it, and learn to love it!

Grow your hair out and dye it if necessary.,
Keep your makeup simple but flawless.,
Go for full, pouty lips.,
Keep your nails short and painted.",How to Look Like Cara Delevingne2," Cara generally keeps her silky, wavy hair at chest length. While it's usually a color that strides the line between light brown and dark blonde, she has been known to dye it wild colors on occasion.Like the rest of her look, she keeps her hair in a myriad of different styles that aren't easy to imitate. When she wears a part in her hair, it tends to either be dead center or dramatically to the right., While she almost always wears a full face of makeup, Cara tends to keep it relatively simple, contrasting with her rebellious personality. She has two major looks when it comes to makeup:


When doing your makeup day-to-day, go for a mostly natural look with neutral lip color, blush, and eye shadow. You can go a little heavy on the eye shadow if you'd like, as Cara often sports smoky eyes. Use one that is either dark gray or a tone a few shades darker than your natural skin color. Avoid true blacks. Accentuate your eyes with mascara on both your top and bottom lashes.
For dressier occasions, try a darker (but still neutral) eye shadow to give yourself an even smokier look. For this style, black eye shadow is fine to use. Finish it off with some classic bright red lipstick or a neutral pink., Cara has naturally plump lips and emphasizes them with her choice in makeup. You can either get fuller lips or accentuate the ones you have using one or more of these methods:


Make sure to keep your lips moisturized. Dryness can make your lips look much thinner than they actually are. Simply wear a layer of lip balm underneath your lip gloss or lipstick. The balm will also give you the added benefit of longer-lasting lip color.Use lip gloss, either as your main lip color or to make lipstick pop. When pairing with lipstick, simply dab a small amount of clear lip gloss in the middle of your lips. This will give them a much poutier look.Contour with multiple shades of lip pencils to give your lips more dimension. Start with a very dark outline of a tone similar to your desired main lip color, such as chocolate or maroon. Then, pencil in the rest of your lips with a brighter color. Blend the two together using a still brighter pencil. Finish up by dabbing or brushing on a tiny amount of cream highlighter to the center of your bottom lip.Overdraw your lip line with lip liner. Trace just slightly beyond your natural lip line. Then, either fill in the rest of your lips with the liner or use a lipstick that matches it as closely as possible., Cara is rarely seen with bare nails. Instead, she sports nail polish in a wide range of colors from quirky silver to classic red. She also occasionally wears nail wraps and appliques with complex designs.


The most important thing you can do to your nails when trying to look like Cara is to keep them short. She almost never lets her nails grow more than a couple millimeters past her fingertips. In fact, she often trims her nails back to extreme ""nubs."""

Stop plucking your eyebrows.,
Use gel to tame wild brows.,
Fill in thin eyebrows.,
Dye lighter eyebrows.,
Consider eyebrow extensions.",How to Look Like Cara Delevingne3," Cara's eyebrows are iconic because they are thick. While most models wax or pluck their eyebrows into perfect thin arches, Cara lets hers grow out naturally.


If you have a unibrow, go ahead and keep plucking or waxing the center. Cara herself would have a unibrow if she didn't pluck it. In fact, the center is the only part of her brows that she does pluck.Many people cannot achieve Cara's eyebrow thickness naturally. Luckily, there are many tricks you can use to make your eyebrows look much fuller and denser.

, If you've successfully grown out your bushy brows, you still want to keep them more-or-less in the same shape. Cara uses a dab of gel to hold hers in place.Many cosmetic companies now manufacture clear holding gels specifically for eyebrows. They come in tubes with brushes similar to mascara. Simply brush the gel on in one direction away from your nose for all-day hold.
It's a good idea to use specially formulated brow gel over hair gel. Hair gel is more likely to flake or be too sticky to use comfortably on your face., If you already have dark eyebrows that are simply a little thin in patches, just fill them in. While common makeup wisdom suggests using a dark powder as a foundation, for a more natural look go for a pencil or cream-based brow products.


Use a color that either matches your natural brow color is only slightly darker. If it's too different a color, your eyebrows will look drawn-on.
Avoid products that have a red tint.Even if your hair naturally has some red pigment, this is difficult to reproduce exactly with cosmetics. Find a more neutral color that is otherwise close to your natural shade.

, Darker eyebrows look fuller than lighter ones. If you have particularly light eyebrows, consider tinting them. You can either get this done by a professional stylistor use a kit at home.In addition to the basic clear variety, brow gels also come in tinted versions. If you want to kill two birds with one stone, temporarily color and tame your eyebrows with a single product., In the wake of the thick eyebrow trend that most credit Cara with starting, more and more stylists are offering eyebrow extension services. Like other types of hair extensions, fibers are added one by one to your existing hairs to make your eyebrows longer and thicker. Keep in mind that this process takes a lot of patience and skill and consequently typically costs hundreds of dollars."

Make-up - Its quite natural and bronzed.,
Hair - wavy.,
Clothes - Think a bit grungy.

,
Jeans - pick distressed light wash or dark or black.

,
Shorts - pick worn in ones, either buy some already distressed looking ones, or cut a pair of old jeans into shorts.,
Tops - Layer up.,
Dresses & skirts - don't pick too girly dresses and skirts, but if you do add a touch edge.,
Shoes & boots - Pick flats mainly, a pair of ankle boots or cowboy boots.,
Jewellery - have a few little bracelets, like a few friendship bracelets, you can find really good jewellery in the men's section it looks quite tough but not too much, just a bit edgy, and add a lot of rings just random ones, don't match them.,
Accessories - find original bags and scarves.,
OPTIONAL - personality - she is quite tough.",How to Dress (Look) Like Amber Heard in Drive Angry," So wear foundation if you want to, and remember to bronze your face, but not too much just so it looks natural. Focus on the eyes. In the film she mainly wears brown smoky eye, which looks very natural due to blending and not using dark eye-shadow on all of the lid. YouTube the style, and find out how to create a brown smoky eye. Lips - Keep it natural. lip balm/natural coloured lipstick. If you can't live with out lip gloss. apply it then blot it on a piece of toilet paper, so that you have a slight sheen.;
, if you have naturally curly hair just flatten it a bit and apply anti-frizz balm. If you have straight hair, you could just add texture to the layers, or curl it loosely with an inch curling iron, or whatever you have. If you have wavy hair, then you're all set. If it is an uneven wave then apply sea salt spray (you can make it if you want or just buy it).

,,, To get the distressed look you could grate the denim with a cheese grater or cut it, Google ways to distress jeans.

, So if you buy a few tank tops in neutral colours and then you can layer them up or wear them on their own. Then you could layer a cardigan on top of that or a checked shirt. Then a leather jacket or something to that effect. This would look good, but in summer you would overheat. So just wear shorts, and a tank top. and if its cold you can find 3/4 length button down tops (which she wears a lot in the film

, E.g. A floral skirt, with a grey tank top tucked in, a thin cardigan and a pair of ankle boots would be a perfect example.

, For normal shoes, pick plimsolls and other shoes like that. For heels, you could pick wedge boots, or anything really. just remember not too girly.

, Finally, long necklaces, layer them up or you can buy them already layered.

, Fringing looks great on bags, just look for whatever style you like. remember to put your style in everything, and don't just copy mindlessly. I personally think that borrowing from the menswear section looks quite good, but not with everything. I think that if you were wearing a skirt, you could buy a men's belt and either just tie it round your waist, or get a hole puncher for belts and this will emphasise your waist and make it look even smaller. :)

, so get in shape and even if you don't want to act like that. it will reassure you that if you were to get in a fight you could protect yourself.

Alex is quite pale, perhaps more so in series 2.,
The hair you use depends on personal preference.,
One distinctive feature about Alex is the makeup that she wears, especially the bold blue eyeliner and the strong blush.

",How to Look Like Alex Drake in Ashes to Ashes (Series 1 and 2)1," While this doesn't quite mean embracing your inner goth, it might require more sun-cream than usual and for faster paling, lemon juice.;
, Do you like the series 1 (tight curl look) or the series 2 (outgrowing perm) style? Either way may involve curling tongs. If you're stuck, look for some things on how to perm and/or how to curl. Also, the cut of your hair depends on what series you're looking at - whilst on series 1 there is a slight fringe that's parted and curled, in series 2 there is a much more obvious solid fringe.

Alex's trademark item of clothing for her tops has to be her white leather jacket.,
The 80s really were about tight jeans.,
No one can forget the dress Alex wore when she first burst into 1981!,
Alex had a pair of white boots to compliment the white jacket as well as a matching black pair.,
Alex always wears accessories that compliment the outfit she's wearing.,
And there you have it - your very own Alex Drake standing before you as your reflection!

",How to Look Like Alex Drake in Ashes to Ashes (Series 1 and 2)2," This is one of the things essential to her 80s look. In series 1 she also wears a lot of off-the-shoulder tops, including one off-the-shoulder dress. In series 2, the look is far more based around button-up tops and slouchy jumpers (which she teams up with the jacket for her CID look, but makes the jumpers go solo for her home look). Also in series 2 Alex's tops begin to sport more patterns, like the sailor striped top (shown in the introduction) and the patterned top in the finale of episode 8.

, This means that your bottoms should consist of tight/skinny jeans, leggings and jeggings. Alex does occasionally wear a skirt to work, but this does not happen as often as the skinny denim look!

, Unfortunately that dress doesn't seem to be something that's readily available from anywhere, but it's the concept that counts - a short red dress with the stockings, red heels and the fluffy coat. (Obviously you need to find an occasion where it's suitable to wear this sort of thing, i.e. wouldn't recommend it for a formal dinner party.) Alex wears a couple of other dresses through the course of the two series as well - these include an off-the-shoulder dress in series 1 and the golden dress in series 2.

, She also is famous for her heels that tend to feature more on the going-out style list, but she sometimes wears them during work-time and CID.

, Her main accessories though are the beads she wears around her neck and the large earrings, usually studs or loops. One distinctive outfit involved her wearing a belt - in series 2 episode 8, her final outfit that she wears before going 'back' to somewhere, she used a red belt that went well with the top she was wearing (that was a very oriental look - cream and red top, red belt, red fan earrings etc.).

Dean insists on taking the wheel at every opportunity, and while you should be responsible when driving, you too should have a close connection to a classic car if you want to be like Dean.


Give your car a cool nickname. In honor of his love of classic rock and, in particular, the band Metallica, Dean christened his car ""Metallicar."" Similarly, you might use one of your favorite bands to name your classic car.
Although Dean is almost always seen in his '67 Chevy Impala, he has on other occasions driven cars that might inspire your classic car selection. Two models worth mentioning are the 1976 Dodge Aspen and 1972 AMC Gremlin.;
, When driving around, Dean is almost always enjoying some good old classic rock. Some artists he is fond of include Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Blue Oyster Cult and Metallica. Or you could train your musical sensibilities in that genre by tuning in to a your local classic rock radio station.


Dean isn't just a fan of the classic rock sound; he knows his favorite bands in the way only a true fan can! Pay attention to the trivia you hear from classic rock DJs so no one will think you're a less dedicated fan than Dean.
There are many different sub-genres in classic rock. You might benefit from a class on the history of music at your local community center, community college, or university. You could also devote some personal research into the different kinds of classic rock., Flannel is rugged, masculine, and is a regular part of Dean's wardrobe. Being more of a typical man's man, you won't see Dean wearing the nicer clothing his brother Sam does unless he has a good reason for it. Dean isn't afraid, however, to proudly wear items that have emotional significance to him, like the amulet/necklace he wears daily that he received from his brother.You might fashion an item a sibling or loved one gave you into a memento necklace. For example, you could weave a coin given to you by a favorite grandparent into a bracelet.

, He may be fighting evil and looking cool while doing it, but Dean's main job is to help people. This is evident from the Winchester family motto, ""Saving people, hunting things - the family business.""Always reach out to help those in need, even if they don't ask. Dean would do everything in his power to help someone who was in dire straits, and you should too if you want to emulate Dean.You might want to spend some time fine tuning your ability to perceive things around you. A heightened awareness of your environment will prepare you better for the task of helping others.

Prepare yourself for worst case scenarios. Knowing how to respond in an emergency situation will help you respond without missing a beat when you're needed most.

Build your mental and emotional fortitude. Dean sometimes has to confront dark and evil things that might make normal people run in fear. You'll have to be able to stand your ground emotionally and mentally to help those who need it most.

, Dean may act tough, but he still puts family first.Dean and his brother Sam are very different people who sometimes intensely disagree on what to do and how to do it, but even so, Dean always looks after his little brother. He also makes sure family friends, like Bobby Singer who is a father figure to Dean, are taken care of. This shows just how much Dean cares for his friends. To Dean Winchester, you don't need to be a blood relative for a person to be family.It can be hard work, especially if you and your siblings don't get along, but just like Dean you should make every effort to be a good brother. In your life, this might mean helping with homework, encouraging your siblings in their sports, or offering advice.
You won't be able to take care of the important people in your life if you are holding a grudge! An important part of taking care of friends and family is taking care of your relationships with them. This might mean you have to forgive certain things and accept others.

, Dean has been in some sticky situations where all has seemed hopeless. This has never stopped him from giving his all, and it's thanks to his tenacity that he's pulled through some of the more difficult challenges he's faced. To truly be like Dean, you'll have to develop the same resolve in the face of difficulty.It may take time and effort, but you can train your will so you can persevere in the face of difficulty. The more you train your willpower, the stronger it will become and the more you'll be able to persevere, just like Dean., Even though Dean has an intense fear of flying, he doesn't allow this to stop him when other people's lives are on the line.Depending on your situation and the kind of fears you are dealing with, you might find that the encouragement of a friend all you need to overcome. Severe fears or phobias, on the other hand, might require the assistance of a mental health professional, like a therapist, before you're able to conquer your fear.

, In many situations Dean has outwitted stronger and more powerful opponents through strategy.Although you might not be heading into a dangerous situation with demons or monsters, you should have a backup plan for situations that call for it. You can backup your computer, plan alternate routes when traveling so you know what to do when traffic is at a standstill due to an accident or closed road, and you can even come up with backup plan for your job just in case you realize your not suited for the one you've been applying for.


In today's world, one of the most important and expensive decisions a young adult is asked to make is that of a college major. You might be uncertain what you want to do in college. If so, be like Dean and come up with alternatives so that not matter what comes to pass, you have an option ready and waiting.
Dating can be nearly as serious as hunting mythic creatures and demons. If you are unsure whether your date will be a good time, you might want to arrange for an ""emergency call,"" where a friend calls during your date to give you a potential excuse to escape.

, Dean is extremely funny and sarcastic. He doesn't shy away from crude humor and sexual innuendos, either.This use of humor has helped him and his brother pull through some difficult situations throughout the TV series, and to be like Dean, you'll need to make use of it as well.


Some aspects of humor are naturally a part of your personality, but that doesn't mean you can't develop your sense of humor. You might be able to train your comedic timing at a stand-up comedy class at your local community center, community college, or comedy club.

, Dean's first experience shooting targets proved that he was a natural shot.Even if you find you're less naturally apt when it comes to handling a firearm, you should take a firearm safety class so that you know how to handle a firearm safely. If you're a beginner when it comes to shooting a weapon, you may want to start with something a little less dangerous, like an airsoft gun.


Many sporting goods stores, firing ranges, and hunting supply stores offer hunter's safety/firearm safety classes. Once you know how to safely handle a gun, you can start target practice.

, Dean is a skilled driver and a accomplished mechanic.You don't have to to master these skills in particular to be like Dean; it's likely that he would appreciate any practical skill that helped fighting the supernatural. Some skills you might consider:


Tracking animals
Camouflaging yourself
Welding

, Dean and Sam have little time to work honest jobs while running around the country putting evil down. To make ends meet while on the road Dean will often hustle money out of bar patrons in games of pool. If you decide to try your hand at hustling, you should be careful! Many places have laws against this sort of thing, and if you win big you might make someone upset enough to start a fight.


Instead of pool, you might find that you're stronger at playing darts. But even where darts are concerned, hustling may be illegal where you live and may get you into trouble.
Dean is also quite fond of cards. Playing poker won't require a billiard table or dart board and requires little space. Carry a deck of cards around with you and perfect your poker skill so you can win the pot just like Dean., While Dean might come off as a womanizing meat-head, according to his brother Sam, aside from being one of the best hunter's of the supernatural Sam's ever met, Dean is also one of the best educated in lore.Without a knowledge of monsters' and demons' weaknesses, Dean would never be able to stop them from hurting people.


For more historic information on fighting evil, you might look into reading the medieval witch hunter manual, Der Hexenhammer, also called the Malleus Maleficarum or ""The Hammer of Witches."""

Check out fan sites for Jade West and research her style.,
Stick to dark colors and cool tones in versatile pieces.,
Pick out comfortable and flat military-style boots.,
Choose accessories that are simple and bold.,
Stay casual with jeans and t-shirts.,
Go for a full goth look with tights and a skirt.,
Wear a dress layered with a button up.,
Add temporary color to your hair.,
Keep your eye makeup classic and simple.,
Apply a soft lip color.",How to Dress Like Jade West," Look on blogs, social media sites or even simple search engine queries for images of Jade West’s outfits on the show. Her character dresses simply but with a distinct sense of style favoring dark colors over pastels or light colors, balancing a feminine yet gothic sensibilityNotice how Jade combines a solid yet detailed bottom -- like blue jeans -- with a patterned top. She keeps the focus on the details by pairing the distressed denim with solid colored checkers. The large squares prevent the outfit from looking too busy while providing a fun and edgy look. By keeping the shirt unbuttoned, the look remains casual and young. Using the solid black tank top underneath plays up the black in the buttoned shirt without being too dressy. Examine how she accessorizes using variety. Jade will choose a basic accessory color and run with it by applying the color and it's neighbouring shades to her belt, shoes, and jewelry. In order to keep her look polished, she maintains the desired shades into her nail polish. Her accessories have clearly been thought of as a finishing piece to her outfit, and are put together carefully. Note that less can be more when pairing accessories, such as wearing a chunky ring with a minimal necklace.Brainstorm where the inspiration for Jade West's style comes from. Often wearing hair extensions, studs and thick-soled boots harken to punk and motorcycle fashion inspirations.;
, When choosing key pieces for your Jade West wardrobe, look for items that are fashionable yet adaptable. Especially while working within a budget, choose items for their versatility so that you can style them many different ways.


A pair of dark denim skinnies with distressed details can be used as a focal point to several outfits. Choosing a well-fitted black pair will allow you to get many different styles from a single pair of jeans.
Jade is often seen wearing leggings. A soft, comfortable legging can be dressed up or down, while being worn with conventional tops, skirts or tunics. A tutu style skirt layered with tulle can be a welcomed change from West's more body hugging styles.Cotton t-shirts are an inexpensive way to keep variety in your outfits while being cost effective. Aim to fill your drawers with solid dark colors such as forest green, navy blue and grey. These fairly neutral colors can be interchanged with many different overlays.

, Jade West doesn't shy away from combat looks and stays away from frills and ribbons. Instead, she often favours more sturdy footwear like laced combat boots or black riding boots.


Check military consignment shops because they often have a variety of military style boots. Look for a rounded toe with grommets up the entire boot as well as long laces.
Go simple with tall black boots. Watch for small details such as buckles, to give a motorcycle-like feel. Buckles and studs will add dimension to an outfit and give a more personalized look. Be careful not to choose an overly-studded style so as to prevent an outfit from looking overwhelming.

, Jade always wears plenty of accessories and it's important to have accessories that can be matched together with ease. Choose accessories within a color range that work for you, such as mostly silver or gold.


Jade often layers her necklaces. By choosing several necklaces in solid metallic hues, they can be mixed and matched together. A bellybutton-length necklace can be easily paired with several shorter necklaces. Don't be afraid to look for geometric pendants, stones and feathers.
Watch out for bangles and bracelets composed of leather. Jade often wears her bracelets similar to her necklaces: layered. Pick up a twenty pack of solid colored, skinny bangles for an easy accompaniment to a single focal bracelet.
Use simple earrings. Jade mostly wears studs in black and grey. Encourage yourself to expand your horizons from studs by checking out faux pearls and glass studs. Dangly earrings may look beautiful however they can be heavy. Starting with a simple stud is a sure way to let your earlobes adjust to the weight.
If you don't have your ears pierced, opt for stick-on or clamp earrings. Small stickers make an easy earring substitute and clamp earrings are a gentle alternative to having your lobes pierced.
Wear statement rings. Go for large dark stones on a simple band, or several thin silver bands that you can stack on top of each other on one finger. Explore all your fingers and watch for smaller bands to fit before your second knuckle, higher up on the fingers, to create a unique look.

, For simple day to day looks at school or work, go Jade-simple. Pair your skinny jeans with a t-shirt. To get more out of your outfit, try layering a patterned, button-up shirt over top your tee. Tuck your jeans into your boots for a final finish on your Jade look.


If you don't have a patterned button-up, try a graphic t-shirt in dark colors. Another variation is a dark legging with a tunic-style top or long sweater. If it feels too boxy, try adding a skinny belt around your waist.
Pump up your accessories. When going with a casual outfit, explore your accessory collection. Try pairing layered necklaces with a chunky ring, or stud earrings with an armful of bangles.
In the colder seasons, try adding a dark colored scarf. The scarf will add a new dimension of texture to your casual outfit.

, Jade isn't afraid to wear a skirt and she often pairs it with leggings. Try wearing a solid color skirt with colorful leggings or vice versa: a colorful skirt with solid black leggings. Finish the outfit off with a neutral grey top.


When pairing tights with a skirt, try to stick to a neutral top to prevent the outfit from looking too busy. It can be easy to get carried away with color.
Skirts and boots aren't a faux pas! If it feels comfortable, wear it.
Remember to stay classy. Jade doesn't show large amounts of midriff or cleavage. Keep yourself covered and classy like she does.
For a different look, try tucking your shirt into your skirt. This can look especially cute with a skirt that sits at the waist.

, Jade tends to keep her shoulders covered in a strappy dress. If you have a simple black dress at home, you can do the same by simply picking your favorite West-style button up and wearing it under or over the dress. Experiment with what feels comfortable to you. If the button up doesn't feel right, try a pull-over sweater. This can also add warmth to an outfit in Winter.


Another option to add to a dress is a black jacket. Military boots with a zippered and studded jacket can make even the frilliest girl dresses look punk rock.

, Avoid your parent's punishment by investing in inexpensive, clip-in hair extensions. Clip-in extensions are available in many colors and are an easy way to change up your look. The extensions are an easy way to prevent your hair from being damaged and dry from coloring. If you can't find the length you like, don't be afraid to clip them into your own hair and carefully cut to your desired length.


Focus on adding color to the front of your face. Jade's extension frequently frame the front of her face. If that feels too brave, try starting in the back of your hair.
Be cautious when styling extensions. When inexpensive, they are often synthetic and can melt when heat is applied.

, Regardless of your eye color, Jade's neutral yet bold eye makeup will look stunning. Be cautious not to over apply eye makeup because it can easily look messy and sloppy with so much dark color. Don't be discouraged if it take many attempts; makeup is about experimentation.


Apply a neutral shadow all over your lid. Keep in mind Jade's lids often look skin-toned and you want to keep a natural look.
Try using a thick eyeliner pencil to get Jade's eyes. While maintaining a dull end, use the pencil to softly line your entire eye. When first learning, you might find it easiest to apply to eyes and tidy with a cotton swab. Use the swab to remove excess makeup and prevent a black-eye look. When detailing the lower portion of the eye, only apply a small amount of liner and gently smudge using the cotton swab.
When applying mascara, rotate the brush outwards from the roots of your lashes. Gently wiggle the brush back and forth horizontally to get a thorough coverage. This keeps your lashes looking thick and natural. If your lashes end up stuck together, gently and carefully separate them with a cotton swab or tooth pick.

, Jade's makeup favours neutral and pink lips. Traditional lipstick can be hard to maintain and manage, therefore try using a colored gloss or balm. Lip balm will keep your lips looking fairly matte and only add a tint of color to your natural tone, while keeping you moisturized. Gloss will add plenty of shine and pucker to your pout.


If you'd like to attempt Jade's red lip look, you may need to experiment depending on your skin tone. Red tones can be finicky and it may take experimentation to find what works for you. Try cherry, fire-engine or coral colored glosses.
To prevent color from appearing on your teeth after applying, make a sucking “O” shape with your lips around your finger. Quickly pull your finger from your mouth while maintaining the shape. Next kiss your lips onto a flat piece of paper towel. The “O” shape will allow your finger to remove any lip color on the inside of your lips, and the paper towel removes excess lip color to prevent it from moving back into your mouth.

Khloe loves leopard-print.,
Be BOLD.,
Shoes are what she lives for.,
She loves maxi dresses.,
She might have an edge, but she's SO not goth.,
She likes jumpsuits.,
Follow trends, but add a twist.,
The three Kardashian ladies (Kim, Kourtney, Khloe) started a clothing line at Sears.,
The three sisters have a store: DASH.,
Take inspiration from the clothes of Khloe's favorite designers.,
Be confident and work your outfit.",How to Dress Like Khloe Kardashian," ""My grandmother told me that leopard will never go out of style. It's a classic.""(Khloe). She loves leopard-print shoes, and she's not afraid to wear a leopard-print dress.;
, Be unique and daring in your style. The Kardashians are so loved for their style. When Kim stepped out in an all-white outfit after Labor Day, it was talked about... in a good way. Khloe takes even more chances. Be bold, be unique in your style.

, She owns 235 pairs of shoes (71 of them Louboutins). They're all EXTREMELY high high high, and tons of them are leopard-print. She's got so many leopord-print heels in different shapes, or a different shade, some with hints of black on the back, etc. In her closet she arranges each pair of shoes so she sees the front of one of the shoes, and the back of the other. Khloe is a no-flat girl; she's rockin' heels. ""When I have babies, I'll probably wear heels to the delivery room."" (-Khloe)

, They're like the every-day throw on sort of thing for her. She has her closet made specially to suit them. Invest in lots of maxi dresses. ""I'm a connoisseur of long flowy dresses. I throw them on when I'm running around and don't have time to think about what to wear."" (-Khloe)

, She's spunky but CHIC; she makes it work. She's not a biker-chick. ""I think skulls can be spooky, unless they are covered in rhinestones."" (-Khloe) She wears black in a classy way.

, They're stylish AND comfortable. She sometimes plays up a black jumpsuit by adding high detailed heels. You could wear a solid coloured one and play it up with accessories. ""A jumpsuit is so easy to wear! Throw it on and you're good to go."" (-Khloe)

, Make it YOUR OWN twist, not necessarily Khloe's. Khloe is all about being unique and changing the trends, so do that. Add your own spin to a unique outfit!

, You can dress like them for something much more affordable. Check it out.

, It's pricy but they carry some of their favorite designers there. You can save up money for some stuff from there or take inspiration.

, She loves Missoni, Dolce and Gabanna (D&B), and Michelle Mason. They do carry Michelle Mason in DASH. Don't try to copy it or find a look-a-like. The point of inspiration is to use it to make your own outfit- it's what Khloe does, makes it her own.

, You can't pass a bold outfit if you don't own it. Khloe is a little plus-size, but she owns what she's wearing and does it so confidently, she has that glow that makes her look beautiful. Wear figure-flattering clothes!

Get your hair layered.,
Don't overdo the makeup.,
Try to find some shoes that resemble hers.,
Save money when you shop.,
Accessorize!,
Go over how to get the ultimate look.,
Remember Liz's outfits revolve around her shoes!

,
Layer your clothes!,
Remember to add your own something to your new style.

",How to Dress Like Liz Lee," Liz has very layered hair that is straight yet a little wavy. Some good advice is to take a picture of her to your hairdresser and get it cut that way. You don't have to dye your hair dark red like hers. Remember, no one said you had to look exactly like Liz, you could dye it light brown maybe or auburn if you wanted, or just not even dye it at all. Try wearing really really sloppy ponytails and buns, but it'll take time to perfect the Liz sloppy ponies!;
, Liz wears very natural colors except for lipstick. Try browns and greys, but she does sometimes wear light pink and gold. She also wears her glasses. So, if you have bad vision but you never wear your glasses, try wearing them a little more.

, Liz always seems to have on a pair of Nike high and low dunks all the time. Now, for some reason these shoes are insanely expensive so try getting a couple pairs that are on sale. And try to get a pair of moccasins, too. She is somewhere between indie, tomboy, and a hint of girlie so get a pair if you want. And Liz hates high heels. She once said in an interview that she thinks their torture and would never do that to herself. But you aren't her, so add anything you want to your new style because remember Liz likes to be different and unique, too.


Center of outfit. Liz said in an interview that she centers her outfits around her shoes. So if you have purple shoes on one day, center your outfit around the color purple!

, Now, Liz doesn't like to buy things expensive so she has said before she mostly shops and thrift stores and at smaller stores that you will find in the mall and have lots of accessories and jewelry.

, Liz wears necklaces that are knotted and she has a cute little golden locket she wears and sometimes even lets it hang open. She doesn't wear earrings a lot but when she does she wears these silver dangly ones that look like leaves. She has two pairs of Ray Bans sunglasses, she has a red pair and a yellow/white pair. She also has those beanies that slouch in the back and she has a bright yellow flat bill hat.

, Now, Liz is really skinny. But she's not anorexic. She probably just has a high metabolism and a small bone frame. If you think you're too big, go on a diet and exercise. But you don't have to, if you like your body the way it is then don't go on a diet. Try doing things that no one does, like wear your jacket around your waist or not use like in every sentence! She is very different and cute.

,, Liz seems to layer almost every outfit! She wears vests over t-shirts and one time in an episode she was wearing a sweater vest over a plaid shirt. Try to think outside the box with what you pick to wear. Also try different color combinations, like orange on top of purple or blue and green...things that pop.

Opt for sensible but flattering styles.,
Buy versatile and timeless clothing.,
Co-ordinate your colours like Belle does.,
Be sophisticated.,
Look for clothes that mimic the castle she lives in.,
When it comes to dressing up, don't be afraid to do it right!",How to Dress Like Belle from Beauty and the Beast1," Belle's style is very simplistic and sensible, but it's still flattering. Take Belle's simple white and blue dress, for example - it's very simple, but it's still flattering. To adapt that style into the modern-day world, think about buying a solid-colour dress and adding a belt at the waist, then pairing it with a solid-colour cardigan.;
, Belle's style is very versatile and effortless - she's able to pair up simple things and pull them off. To mimic this, wear blouses, cardigans, and skirts which are classic and timeless. Instead of buying clothes that are very trendy, go instead for items that are always in style and that you know you'll be able to wear a lot.

, Remember that there's a difference between co-ordinating and matching the colours; you don't want to literally match every part of your outfit, stick to just a few solid colors that compliment your eye, hair, and skin color and that go well together.

, This style should be put together and sophisticated. This means that short-shorts and tanks should be worn only at the beach or for a jog, and opt instead for classier, more put-together outfits when out with friends, at a restaurant, etc.

, Items that suggest a gothic, vintage style are perfect, like intricate embroidery, brooches, or old-fashioned buttons.

, Wear a bright-colored dress that fits in at the waist and has some nice detailing on it, such as ruffles, ribbon, or a bit of beading. Although you don't have to go all-out with a ballgown, you can incorporate touches of her beautiful gown into a modern-day sundress or another shorter dress.

Achieve a dark color for your hair.,
Wear a hair bonnet.,
Use makeup.,
Use lipstick that appeals to your type:


For fair skin: Light orange, light pink, coral, cherry red, or natural nude.,
Use a teeth whitener to make your teeth celebrity-like.

Dress like Blair Warner:


Dress conservatively, leaning towards preppy if possible.",How to Look Like Blair Warner from the Facts of Life," Warner's hair in real life is naturally dark. Get your hair to be a shoulder-length or longer, but no more than 8 inches (20.3 cm) long.


Wash your hair with a good shampoo that will give you that lush shine and bounciness. You can try using Pantene Pro V or Herbal Essence produces. You can also just choose products that is best for your hair type.
Use a volume spray and spray it on your wet hair. Don't use spritz though, you want a bouncy look, not a stiff one.
Take a round brush and a blow dryer. Take the brush, roll, and blow each section as you go. Continue this until you get everything rolled. The round brush should help curl out the ends. When you're done, use lots of oil sheen and spray your hair. Aqua Net is the best hair spray to do this with.;
, Warner always wears one and it helps to avoid dryness or breakage in your hair. You can get bonnets at beauty supply stores or at local drug stores.

, Get Proactive Skin Solution to achieve a blemish free face. Depending on your skin type and how oily your skin is will depend on the kind of product to use; no one's skin is the same. Get tans on a regular basis or use a self tanner. Be careful when using tanners and try to avoid those orange and streaky looks. You'll also want to achieve a natural looking tan, something that doesn't look like you have tried to get.

,
For olive tanned skin: peach, coral, light brown, berry wine color, terracota, or mauves.
For dark skin to golden brown tones: Gold, plums, burgundy, brown, deep wine colors

,,
Keep your clothes neat and clean.
Wear floaty blouses, long skirts, and cowgirl boots.

, Don't put anything in it. Also, get bangs if you don't have them.

, Make sure it is black. Name it one of Emily's cats' names, such as Miles, Mystery, NeeChee, or Sabbath. If someone tells you that your cat has the same name as Emily's cats, just smile mysteriously and leave.

, Her favourite ones are ""That sucks rocks"" and ""Gibbering bumfarks"".

, Emily was an awesome skater but if you really can't skate or you are bad at skating , don't be a poser and carry around a skateboard. Be a thinker instead.

, Emily is an inventor.

, Don't smile at a joke. Only laugh or smile at something scary or really goth. And make sure you have an evil laugh.

, If you're in a public place such as the mall, look mysterious and sit around petting your cat. But if you don't have a cat don't bother with fakes etc. It looks stupid and won't have the same effect.

, Emily is loyal to her mother, cats, Jakey and possibly Raven., Be yourself. Don't give a damn to what others say., Emily travels heaps. Embrace (if you can) your travelling idk spirit.

Admire your drawing.",How to Draw Deadpool," Sketch an evenly proportioned circle near the upper edge of the paper. Draw a horizontal line across the bottom quarter of the circle.This circle will act as a guide for the shape of Deadpool's head.;
, Draw an elongated curve beneath the bottom of the circle, then draw a vertical line down the center of the entire structure.This curve will act as a guide for his jaw and chin.
The curve should connect to the circle at both ends of the horizontal guideline, and the bottom should be somewhat narrowed. The vertical span of this curve should nearly match the height of the original circle.
Draw the vertical guideline down the center of the face if you want a front-facing sketch. For an angled sketch, you'll need to position the vertical guideline further to the side facing away from the viewer.

, Lightly draw two vertical lines extending down from either side of the chin curve. Draw a diagonal line coming off each of these vertical lines.


The two vertical lines should start slightly above the vertical middle of the chin curve, and they should stop shortly before the bottom of the same curve. These two lines will form the character's neck.
The two diagonal lines should point downward and away from the head. They should begin two-thirds down the neck lines and be approximately three-quarters the diameter of the head. Together, these two lines form the shoulders.

, Draw two pointed ovals, placing them in between the bottom edge of the head circle and the enclosed horizontal guideline.


These will become the eyes, and they should have a horizontal, narrow football-shape.
Make both eyes the same size if creating a front-facing sketch. Each eye should be roughly one-sixth as wide as the head circle.

For an angled sketch, make the ""closer"" eye slightly larger than the ""further"" eye.


Place each eye oval an equal distance away from the vertical guideline. Each eye should also should hit the enclosed horizontal guideline.

, Trace back over the outer perimeter of the entire face structure (head, jaw, and chin). Add more definition to the face where appropriate.


Draw a small triangle at the top of the head, placing it next to one side of the vertical face guideline and pointing the tip of the triangle away from the same vertical line. This small peak represents the crease of Deadpool's mask.
Flatten the curves of the initial head circle so that the sides of the face seem straight.
Add small, shallow curves to each side, starting at the horizontal face guideline and extending down over the top quarter of the chin curve. These new curves will become his ears.
Angle the chin curve, making it narrow at a sharper angle as it reaches the bottom. Flatten the bottom of the curve to give the character a sturdy, square-like jaw.

, Trace back over each eye. Follow the same basic shape, but make one eye wider than the other.


Expand the top curve of the right eye to make the overall eye appear wider.
Keep the oval shape of the left eye along its outer edge, but sharpen the inner end of the same eye so that it forms a more narrow point toward the inside of the face.
Doing this gives the shape of the eyes a more expressive appearance. If desired, you could also swap the two eyes, making the right narrow and the left wide.

, Sketch a line above each of the eyes to mimic the brow bone. Add two smaller lines beneath each eye to complete the bone structure of the eye space.


The outer portion of each upper brow line should start shortly before the outer point of the eye and just slightly above it.
For the brow above the wide eye, follow the basic curve of the eye until you reach the inner eye point. At that point, draw an upward curve that extends toward the vertical face guideline while pointing away from the eye.
For the brow above the narrow eye, follow the basic curve of the eye but gradually move the brow down as it reaches the inner tip of the eye. The brow curve should touch at the inner eye tip, then curve upward and away from the eye like the other brow does.
For the two small lines beneath each eye, simply draw a small downward diagonal dash. It should start near the inner corner of each eye and point away, extending only one-third the length of the eye.

, Draw a large, vertical oval around each eye to create the eye portion of the character's mask.


Each oval should extend from the vertical middle of the original circle down to the vertical center of the chin curve.
Technically, these should not be perfect ovals. The outer side of each patch should curve like a proper oval, but the inside should be wider; the top and bottom lines of the inside should meet at the patch's vertical center in a wide, curved point.

, Sketch the first line from the lower endpoint of one neck line to the lower endpoint of the other neck line. Place the second line above the first.Both lines should curve slightly upward, and the two should run parallel to one another.
The middle third of the top line should be hidden beneath the character's chin. Overall, the line should extend over the vertical middle of his neck.

, Draw a pair of inward diagonal lines extending down from the right of the collar. Mirror this pair on the left side.


The inner line of each pair should start at the edge of the chin, and the outer line of each pair should be halfway between the inner line and the edge of the neck outline.
Both lines in each pair should run parallel to one another and match the angle of the chin on that side of the face.

, Sketch a nearly horizontal line beneath each neck line. These lines should extend from the inside of each inner neckline to a point just outside the original neck perimeter guidelines.


Each line should be nearly horizontal, but it should actually fall at a gradual downward angle from the outside to the inside.
At the inside end of each line, draw a sharper, small line pointing down and inward. These sharper lines should roughly match the angle of the inner neck lines.

, Sketch a long diagonal line starting at the upper left shoulder guideline. Mirror this line on the upper right shoulder guideline, too.


Each diagonal should extend upward and away from the head.
Start the diagonal roughly one-fifth down from its respective shoulder. Extend it upward at an approximate 30-degree angle until a point just beneath the top of the head.
These two lines will become the guidelines for Deadpool's katanas.

, Place a short horizontal line across one-seventh of the bottom katana guideline. Draw a rectangle around the top sixth-sevenths of the guideline. Repeat for both sides.


The short horizontal line will be the guard of the hilt, and the rectangle will be the hilt itself. The rectangle should follow the angle of the original guideline, but it should be less wide than the horizontal guard line.
Draw a second horizontal line inside the hilt rectangle near the top. This will be the pommel of the hilt.

, Draw a second horizontal line just beneath each original guard line. Place two vertical lines beneath this new horizontal line, extending them down from the guard to the shoulder.


Close the sides of the upper and lower guard lines to complete the guard shape.
The vertical lines should roughly match the size of the hilt lines, and they should follow the angle of the original guideline. Together, these lines form the sword sheaths.

, Trace over the permanent lines of the character. Press harder to make the lines darker and more defined.


The permanent lines include any line that defines some feature of the character.
You can use a pencil or an ink pen, but if you use ink, make sure that the ink dries completely before continuing.

, Once you define the permanent lines, go back through and erase any temporary guideline you no longer need.


This includes the guidelines of the katanas, the bottom of the face circle, and the vertical and horizontal guidelines inside the face. It also includes any unnecessary line segments that remained after redefining the shape of his face, neck, and shoulders.

, You can leave this drawing as a simple sketch, but you could also add color if you wish to do so.


If you do add color note that the main portion of the mask and neck will be red. The collar and eye portion of the mask should be black.
The swords should also be black or dark gray.

, Congratulations! You've just finished drawing Deadpool.

For everyday shoes, go for the most comfy style.,
Be more daring when going out.",How to Dress Like Belle from Beauty and the Beast2," Belle spends most of her day exploring her town or the castle on her feet. Choose shoes that are comfortable but still feminine, like a pretty ballet flat or a small kitten heel. Again, go for versatility and choose shoes in solid, neutral colors such as black, brown, grey, or blue. If these shoes are too boring for you, consider buying some with pretty bows or sequins on them.

, Although Belle is sensible, she definitely has a bold and daring side! When going out, wear some high heels in a bright and eye-catching color.

"
"
Be practical and classy with your jewelry.,
Consider getting a book bag.",How to Dress Like Belle from Beauty and the Beast3," No chunky, over-sized pieces. Keep it extremely simple, such as a necklace with a small charm on a simple chain. Try to incorporate Belle's love of reading into your look by finding book-themed accessories.

, Hold all of your necessities in a book bag rather than a frilly purse. A simple, over-the-shoulder satchel should go with everything.

"
"
Makeup (if any) should be kept simple.,
For daytime hair, make it look effortless.,
For more formal hair, go all-out.",How to Dress Like Belle from Beauty and the Beast4," Stick to the basics by using a light foundation to even out your skin tone. For your eyes, use a soft beige eye shadow and a chocolate brown or black eyeliner on your top lid only. Finish off with chocolate brown or black mascara on your top lashes only. Add a light rosy blush to make you look naturally flushed. Finish off with a light pink or nude gloss.

, For Belle's daytime look, draw your hair into a low-slung ponytail with a pretty ribbon. A great modern alternative to a ribbon is using a headband with a bow on it. Make sure to leave some hair out to frame your face. It should look effortlessly pulled back, like you didn't try too hard.

, Curl your hair, then pull it back in a half-ponytail. Put the top half of your hair into a bun, and leave the rest down. If you'd like, adorn it with pretty clips.

Know that there are many types of fan-made Vocaloids.,
Think of the idea for your Fanmade Vocaloid.,
Name your Vocaloid.,
Make your Vocaloid's design.,
If you can, give your Vocaloid a voice configuration.,
Give your Vocaloid a character item.,
Put your Vocaloid out there!",How to Create a Vocaloid," There are genderbend Vocaloids, which are Vocaloid designs redrawn to look like the opposite gender, and/or voicebanks edited to sound like the opposite gender, or songs with the pitch edited for the same reason. There are human Vocaloids, who are human singers with Vocaloid-inspired avatars, who cover Vocaloid songs. They are also known as Utaite (for Nico Nico Video) or YTSinger (for YouTube). There are Voyakiloids, or ""grouching Vocaloids,"" such as Yowane Haku or Honne Dell who are ""failure versions"" of existing Vocaloids. There are fan-made Vocaloid Mascots, who are derived characters that are only meant as mascots and do not sing. There are Original Vocaloid Characters, who are not based off of any existing Vocaloid - and a lot more!;
, Maybe you want to make Miku's ten-year-old cousin, or a companion to Nekomura Iroha that's based off Kerroppi, similar to how she's based off of Hello Kitty. Whatever it is, be original - and be careful that your idea isn't done yet!

, Make sure you check out Utaus at this point- you might be in a big mess if your Vocaloid has the same name as an existing Utau. If your Vocaloid is based off of a Japanese Vocaloid, it's best to give them a Japanese name in correct order (surname, given name)

, This is the fun part! Make sure you style their hair, give them an eye and hair color, and of course a cool outfit. Don't just recolor Miku or Kaito - it's overdone, and not as fun and creative! Try making a whole new outfit for them, or blend parts of existing Vocaloid outfits. You can even have them be inspired by anime characters, real life clothes, anything~

, If you have a Vocaloid, try playing with their settings and make your new Vocaloid's voice. Don't worry if you don't own Vocaloid programs and can't give your fan-made a voice! The fan-made can be a previously mentioned Human Vocaloid and use your voice, or it can just be a mascot.

, All Vocaloids and fan-mades have their iconic item: Miku has her negi, Kaito has ice cream, Gakupo has eggplants... it can be anything! Typically, Japanloids have food items while English Vocaloids have more materialistic items, but don't be afraid to break the mold!

, Depending on what you are best at, there are a number of things you can do. Of course, there is the obvious answer of making songs for it: you can try to compose your own songs for your fanmade, but you can also have it cover existing songs by either Vocaloids or human singers. You can also post drawings of your Vocaloid, make an MMD model for it, or write fanfiction starring your Vocaloid. It's your Vocaloid, the possibilities are endless!

Kick your left foot behind your right knee.,
Kick your left foot out.,
Kick your right foot behind your left knee.,
Kick your right foot out.,
Pick up the pace.,
Get your hands into it.",How to Do the Spongebob (Dance)," Lift up your left foot and kick the foot just behind your knee, so you make a figure four shape. Keep your weight steady on your right foot. You can think of this as the position you would have if you were to sit on the floor with your legs crossed, except you're only crossing one leg behind the other in this case.


You can also start this dance move with your right foot instead of your left. It really doesn't matter, unless you're coordinating your moves with other people.;
, After you kicked your left foot up behind your right knee for one count, kick it out to the left, so it just barely lifts off the ground. As you do this, hop to the right a bit with your right foot. You don't have to hop far, just a few inches. It takes some coordination and practice to master this.

, Make sure to land that left foot on the ground first as as you lift up your right foot. Just mirror the motion you already did with your left leg. Continue to maintain your balance as you execute this move.

, Just as you did with your left foot, keep it lifted off the ground a tiny bit. Make sure to jump to the left a bit with your left foot. Doing this on both sides will essentially keep you in about the same place as you continue to do the Spongebob dance.

, Continue doing this 4-step dance while picking up the pace and going faster until people can't even see exactly what you're doing with your feet. Part of the fun is to pick up the speed and look like you're really rocking your dance moves. This will take some practice to get perfect.


If you really want to go wild, you don't have to stay in almost the same place the whole time. Move around the room, turn while you do the Spongebob, or alternate between moving around and staying in one place.

, Though there's no set move you have to do with your hands to execute the Spongebob, adding your hands to the mix will give the dance more flair and flow. The easiest thing you can do is to move your hands in, toward your center (you can cross them for emphasis), when you kick your leg in, and move them out, palms facing away from you, whenever you kick your leg out.


You can also just move the arm opposite the foot that is kicked out up, and move the other arm down by your side, alternating as you alternate feet.
You can also just keep your hands up by your chest while you show off your moves to draw more attention to your feet.

DON'T STOP THERE!!!",How to Draw Comic Book Heroes1," Before you get to drawing, have a picture in your head on what you want your hero/ character/ villain/ exc. to look like! Remember, there's no such thing as limits for imagination!
, The BEST materials to draw are:

Mechanical Pencils
Eraser
Colored Pencils
Print Paper (no lined paper)
A good place to draw at, a flat surface will do you good!

, Now if you read those ""How to Draw Blah Blah Blah"" books, you really don't need to follow the books guide lines. For example, you don't have to do those lines in the beginning and other weird stuff, just get to drawing! Also, if you ever get stuck on something like hands and muscles, look up other characters from other resources (Superman, Batman, Spiderman, exc.) This always helps in case you ever get stuck., and allow whatever your mind comes up with!, After you're done, try some more! You may be asking why, and I will tell you why!And have fun with it!

Don't be afraid to crack a joke.,
Act a little over-the-top.,
Think psychotic cheerleader.,

Develop your analytical skills.,
Give into your passions.,
Don't be afraid to change your mind.",How to Cosplay as Harley Quinn," This villain is a Goldilocks, so if you're going to copy her style, you'll need to go blonde. Depending on which version of Harley you want to recreate, you may also want to add some other colors. In some iterations, such as in the film Suicide Squad, she has blonde hair with pink and blue pigtails.When her hair is showing, it's usually in pigtails.
In other instances, Harley has joker-style hair. When her outfit is a black and red joker costume, then her hair is often black and red, too. Her hair will be split down the middle with one side being red and the other black, usually opposite the colors on her outfit. In other words, if her right shoulder is in black, then the hair above it will be red, while the left shoulder is red and the hair above is black.;
, Once again, you'll need to choose which Harley Quinn you're going to go with, as her makeup varies depending on what iteration you're looking at. You can choose between classic Harley Quinn, or one of the more updated versions, such as the Suicide Squad Harley, though almost all of them start with making your face look paler.Classic Harley has a pale face, dark red lips, and a black mask.
If you want to go for a simpler version, skip the black mask, and go for dark eyeliner and eye shadow instead.
For Suicide Squad, you'll start with a pale face, then you can add eye shadow to match your hair. For example, if your left pigtail is blue, add blue eye shadow on that side. Add pink eye shadow on the other side. You can add a little black heart on one cheek, if you'd like. Add a pink-red lipstick, and you're done.

, You have a few options when choosing to dress like Harley Quinn. You can go all out with a red and black joker's outfit.On the other hand, you could take a line out of the 2016 movie's book and go for a red and white baseball tee, short black shorts, fishnet stockings, boots, and a fancy black belt. Don't forget to add some black gloves either way you go.She also sometimes wears a red jester's hat., Harley has a penchant for strange weapons. While you shouldn't wield an actual weapon, you can carry a convincing fake version. Since Harley's weapons are strange anyway, a fake one will probably be more convincing than the real thing anyway.Some of Harley's weapons include a giant mallet, a baseball bat, and a gun that shoots a cork.

, Harley Quinn is a superb gymnast, so if you want to move like her, try working on your own skills. While you don't want to attempt anything too crazy, particularly if you've never done any acrobatics, learning something simple like a cartwheel can help you be more convincing as Harley.A cartwheel involves standing with your feet shoulder-width apart and then flipping yourself to the side. Start by working on mats or somewhere with a soft landing place. Have someone spot you the first couple of times you try it.If you really want to up your acrobatic game, consider finding a local gymnastic gym to learn some new skills.

, One of Harley's defining traits is a sense of humor that is hard to kill. Even in the most serious situations, she's not afraid to crack a joke. To be like Harley, try to use humor to diffuse situations, especially if they seem a little too serious.In fact, much like Marvel's Deadpool, she tends to poke fun at other characters in the D.C. universe.

, Harley is known for her outrageous personality. In fact, some have described it as ""cartoonish."" To be in line with this character, you've got to be willing to act a little silly, maybe even a little crazy. Harley certainly would.For instance, in ""Super Power Beat Down: Joker & Harley Quinn VS Deadpool & Domino (#1.16),"" Deadpool says, ""Hey, cutie! Time to die!"" Harley responds with, ""Wait! Want to see a movie?"" and then proceeds to use her cleavage to try to get out of the situation., DC actually describes Harley as ""bubbly and psychotic,"" which is a somewhat odd combination when you take it at face value. However, it's her bubbly personality in conjunction with her villainous acts that sells the psychotic part of her personality. So play up the girly side a bit (think giggly), but don't be afraid to throw a seriously scary look at times.For instance, one quote from Harley in Suicide Squad is ""What was that? I should kill everyone and escape? Sorry, it's the voices. Haha, I'm kidding! That's not what they really said.""

, While Harley Quinn plays a villain (most of the time) in the DC universe, she actually started as a psychiatrist. Therefore, to get started on your journey to acting like Harley Quinn, make sure you brush up on your knowledge of the mind.If you don't know where to get started, try checking out a book from your local library.
Another option is to take a free online course from a place like Coursera or Princeton's online free courses.

, As a psychologist, Harley started out trying to figure out the Joker before becoming his sidekick. While you probably shouldn't join the dark side, Harley's analytical skills are an important part of her character that you can emulate.One way to develop analytical skills is to think about books as you're reading them. Try to figure out what's going to happen next, or try to figure out what the book would be like if it was written from another character's viewpoint.
Focusing on your math studies can also help, as math helps you build solid analytical skills. If you're not in school, consider picking up a book to learn some new math or checking out online tutorials.

, While you don't want to go over the deep end like Harley does, she's not afraid to be passionate. She throws herself into the things she loves. Just be a little cautious, as this trait is what lead her to be obsessed with the Joker, and eventually drew her to the dark side., While classically, Harley was a villain and a sidekick to the Joker, she's become a more ambivalent, almost good character in recent years. In fact, she often tries to help people, even if her attempts fail. Therefore, to be like Harley, don't be afraid to turn away from bad decisions."

Walk with sass.",How to Cosplay As Meg from Disney's Hercules," Meg looks like a beautiful Greek goddess, and Hercules even states she's ""more beautiful then Aphrodite"". If you have ever read any Greek mythology, you know this is a good way to tick
, Meg has her hair long and brown in a ponytail. She also has a beautiful purple gown and strappy sandals. Her lips are ruby red and her eyes sparkle. Try your best to achieve this look.


Meg's hair is brunette, with a tiny hint of red. You can dye your hair if you want to achieve this color. She has side-swept bangs with a tiny curl at the end, and to tiny little curly pieces of hair by each of her ears. If you want, you can bring a picture of her to your hair stylist to get this same hair, but because she *is* a cartoon, you might want to find a similar style to achieve. She always wears her hair in a high ponytail, so make sure you do, too. Also, curl your hair if it isn't curly already.






Try to wear mostly purple clothes. Also try to wear more pretty and elegant clothing that's a bit flow-y.






Wear a tiny bit of purple eyeshadow, some black eyeliner, and black mascara to achieve similar eyes. Use ruby-red lipstick with a tiny bit of clear gloss.






Wear purple contact lenses.







, Get boys to crawl all over you by doing cute things like winking and playing the damsel in distress act. Get what you want by being flirty. Also be a bit sarcastic.


If you play 'damsel in distress', be careful with what guy you play it with. If there's a guy you don't care too much, when he tries to help you, state that you can handle yourself unless you really can't. If he doesn't listen, you may need to stab him a little to get his attention. When Meg first doesn't know Hercules too well, when he tries to help her, she is feisty and states ""I'm a damsel... I'm in distress... I can handle this. Have a nice day!"" and ""I'm a big tough girl, I tie my own sandals and everything."" (Even though this is a lie and her sandals are actually Velcro.) But as she got to know him and began to fall in love with him, she started letting him help her.






Meg is constantly saying sarcastic and witty lines throughout the movie. You can use a few lines from the movie, and make sure you come up with your own, too. Puns from 4Chan are to be avoided at all costs.







, Meg has Hercules. Try to find a man like him: muscular, tall, and a total sweetheart.# Always be careful with who you fall in love with. When Meg went out with her first boyfriend, he soon became in horrible danger, so she sold her soul to Hades to save her boyfriend. But shortly after, he broke up with her to go out with a different girl. After this, Meg vows not to fall in love but ends up falling in love again. Don't stop falling in love! Just be very careful with the man you choose, because you can totally control exactly who you fall in love with and no one ever has problems with this.


Try to choose a guy who will love you for who you *are*, not for what you look like. He should be cute and muscular, but still sweet and optimistic. Just remember this rule of dating: ""Attractive, nice, sane: pick two.""







, Meg sways her hips this way and that, try doing this. Meg's walk is very important.

But because you can't believe in every little thing, you have to make your own philosophy whether you agree with Vash or not. Write it on a piece of paper so you won't forget. You don't have to make it long or complicated. You could make your philosophy as simple as what you think is right and wrong. DON'T FORGET TO SHOW YOUR PHILOSOPHY IN YOUR ACTIONS. That doesn't mean to tell everyone you meet your philosophy, but actually live by it.;
, From what you decided your philosophy to be, your catchphrase should have do with it. Vash's famous catchphrase is: ""Love and peace!"". Make it simple and catchy! Have fun with it!

, If Vash was to be one thing, it would be funny! You should have a sense of humor to cheer people up, too! Remember though, when being comical you should be serious in the inside, too. He uses his comical skills to help lighten the mood, so you should too.

, Along with being comical, Vash can be dead serious. You can't joke around all the time and being serious is a must. When in a dangerous situation, you should never joke around and keep a straight face.

, Vash always helps people out in their time of need without any thought of getting a reward. Help people here and there. Pick up someone's books they dropped; help a senior get across the street; give directions to lost travelers. If someone is being bullied, stop the bully! It will give you a good reputation and become like Vash! Do good in other people's lives.

, Vash is never in distress. He owns a gun and knows how and when to use it. Don't just go out a buy ANY type of weapon. You need training and a license to use a weapon. Learn how to know when to use it. Vash lives by the rule: ""No one has the right to take another life."" So he never kills. Don't use weapons to look cool; use weapons to defend yourself or others.

, Learn how to get out of nasty situations safely without hurting yourself or others. Vash always has a plan up his sleeve and when he doesn't, he thinks one up real quick! DON'T GET YOURSELF IN DANGEROUS SITUATIONS JUST TO SEE IF YOU CAN GET YOURSELF OUT! That's dumb and could get yourself in a lot of trouble.

, Give everyone hellos and good mornings! People will want to be around you and even become your friend. Talk to everyone who wants or needs a friendly greeting. They can be your teacher, boss, or even a lonely classmate. Just be as friendly as you can!

, Vash is a man who cries and doesn't care who sees. Don't bottle up your emotions (it's not good for you anyway). Smile when you're happy. Cry when you're sad. Don't hide yourself from your emotions.

, Vash doesn't stress out and is usually carefree. Stop and look at the sky once in a while. Listen to the birds sing their songs. Or do what Vash does: Sit down and eat some donuts! Stop and relax so you won't become overwhelmed by school or work.

, Vash doesn't do something just because others are doing it. Do things because YOU want to do them. Also, there is another way to be an individual than just doing actions. You should also dress like an individual! Wear what you want to wear because it is conformable.

, Be confident when you see someone picking on someone else or even you. Vash wants to stop violence and keep peace, so make sure to tell everyone who does something unjust that it's wrong. Don't get scared; speak your mind!

Get Tess' Makeup Look.",How to Be Like Tess Tyler from Camp Rock," Getting the attitude is the most important part of playing any rich girl. You don't have to be rich, but you need to act like it. Look down at anyone who is less fabulous than you, (and who isn't, right?)


You can choose whether to be up-front rude or only bratty when you're alone, but either way, you'll need to be a bit ""snobby rich girl"" at some point. Take Mitchie, for example. Tess was up-front rude to her until she ""found out"" that her mom was in charge of the most popular pop music TV Show in China. Tess never trusted her, and neither should you to anyone. Although you are most likely a poser, act like you're not and make anyone else who is act like they never met you.;
, They can be designer, they can be bargain-fabulous, or they can be a mix of both. Either way, you need to keep up the I'm better than you and you know it attitude, so act like you're wearing a Versace evening gown all the time. If you don't know who the heck Versace is, you need some magazines. Maybe start out with CosmoGirl! or Seventeen. Move on later to Teen Vogue, Ellegirl, or Elle.


It depends on what's popular where you live, but some things are always fabulous. A few top designers (for people with a bit more cash than others) are Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Dooney & Bourke, Louis Vuitton, D & G, Versace (as mentioned before), and Juicy Couture. All are fabulous.
Some other, not-as-couture, more budget-friendly, brands are American Eagle, Hollister, Abercrombie, Abercrombie & Fitch, and (sometimes) Tommy Hilfiger. It's really easy to find all sorts of designers at discount stores such as TJ Maxx, Marshalls, and, if you're lucky, thrift stores, (the Goodwill, etc.).

, Okay, not good, astoundingly amazing. You can polish that ""good/great"" voice with school or professional chorus classes. If you're a pop-person, listen to actually talented singers (aka, not Britney Spears, Madonna, or Ashley Simpson) like Leona Lewis, any American Idols, or any other people who actually sound like they could sing without a microphone, mixers, or sound technicians.

, unlike Tess Tyler. You can have some popular friends who are rich like you, but make sure your real BFFs are people you could trust if you gave them $25 not to spend it. Really.


Well, if you really don't have any friends at camp or wherever you are, you could get some temp-friends, or BFFNs (best friends for now). That way you aren't too lonely, and you won't have to worry about having long-distance relationships.

, Tess doesn't let everyone know she likes Shane, but still tries to get him. Don't try too hard to get him though, otherwise you will end up like her.


Again, if you are going for the total-Tess, try so hard to get the guy that you crash and burn in front of everyone who thought you couldn't.

, It will make you seem a billionaire who just turned into a hobo. Everyone who envied you will realize that you are not totally flawless, which will completely ruin your rep. Exceptions are:


If you don't it will hurt your reputation
Someone just came up from behind and told your deepest, darkest, and most shallow secret and now everyone is either laughing at you or badly gossiping about you.
You absolutely need to look like a saint to prove you're not the backstabbing, lying, mean, bratty, witch that you actually are.
Or, for some other reason that you feel in your gut that you absolutely need to apologize because you just made a huge mistake that everyone will hate you for otherwise.

,,, Tess has very natural looking makeup and does not overdo it. If you want to get lots of makeup, you should wear foundation, light pink blush, eyeshadow, black pencil eyeliner on the upper lid not winged, mascara, and lipstick. If you don't want to wear lots of makeup, you should wear mascara, eyeshadow and lipstick if you wish.

, Think ""I want it all"" and ""I want fabulous!"" and ""Everything's got to be perfect for me!"" expect perfection and no less, and expect perfection in yourself, though you are already beautiful.

, But try to get some of the things Sharpay has in her locker,like mirrors and try to get some other girly and glamorous things in your locker, too. If you don't have a locker and have to carry around a school bag, get a shoulder bag, NOT a rucksack and make it pink, girlie or sequined.

, and don't forget your cute school bag or handbag!

, Try giving orders sweetly, but get angry if they are not obeyed.

, In the unlikely scenario that you come across someone with the potential to upstage you, get them out of the way, distract them, do ANYTHING! Oh and practice for HOURS EVERY night! Take Singing/Acting/Dancing lessons if you can, join your local theatre group, anything!

,, Come TOP but do it with STYLE! Come top in everything but don't be a nerd, do it fabulously and subtly hint your superiority.

,, She really likes salads and pastas, anything fancy you can think of, such as caviar or crème brulee. At free period, she drinks a non-fat no-foam soy latte with one packet of organic sweetener. You can go to Starbucks and ask the barista to make it, or you can make one at home! Sharpay is most likely to drink vitamin water or smart water.

, Also consider asking your sibling(s) or mum/dad to give you a massage.

Always wear tasteful clothing.,
Care about your personal style, but not too much.,
Be happy in your own skin.",How to Be Like Miss Congeniality's Gracie Hart," Take self-defence classes so you can beat up even the beefiest of men if you need to. Remember Gracie's SING self-defence (kicking your assailant in the solar plexus, instep, nose and groin).;
, Gracie does lots of exercise for her job, and it pays off. Try to go jogging or go to the gym every day.

, Read up on the news, and be observant.

, Be happy to hang out in your baggiest of clothes and have a laugh with the guys.

, Gracie always eats whatever she wants, whenever she wants. That's not to say you should pig out on junk food all the time, but make sure you get at least three healthy meals a day.

, Gracie is friendly to everyone she meets, and ends up with many friends at the end of the films as she is kind and caring and genuinely values her relationships with others.

, Gracie risks her life to save others, as she is a kind and selfless person.

, Gracie always wears clothes that cover her body, and when she had to enter the swimsuit competition, she didn't enjoy it! Make sure your clothes cover up everything they should.

, In Miss Congeniality, Gracie learnt to value her appearance, but then learnt the hard way in the sequel that caring too much about how she looked could be a bad thing. Embrace your natural beauty, and just use a little makeup to accentuate it if you want.

, This is the most important part of Gracie's character - she doesn't care what other people think - she's just happy being herself. Love yourself for who you are, and surround yourself with people who love you for you.

Make the most of your space.,
Develop a girlish sense of style.,
Purchase shoes that are nothing but fun.,
Wear eye-makeup.,
Obsess over boys.,
Be girly, bright, and happy-go-lucky.",How to Be Like Molly Gunn," Whether your chateau is large (like Molly's penthouse in the beginning of the film) or small (like her shoe-box apartment in the end) you can still make it great.


Regardless of the size of your bed (and whether or not you even have a bed frame) any bed can have a canopy. Measure the height (floor to ceiling) and the length of your bed (both sides) and then purchase some cheap tulle. If you have a frame, move your bed away from the walls, but do not center it in your room. If you do not have a frame, place your bed in a corner, but at an angle, so that the edge of the bed is parallel with the corner. There are four sides of your bed. The short sides, and the long sides.
Pin tulle to the ceiling so that it is parallel with each short side. Also pin tulle between these two sides, along the ceiling, but leave slack, so that it hangs nicely. Ivory tulle with glitter is very similar to the tulle on Molly's bed in her penthouse. If you can afford it, invest in a circular gold canopy hanger (like the one above her bed in the opening scene). If you are shopping for a bed frame, purchase a white iron one, but shy away from a canopy bed, because Molly's canopy is not hung from her bed.
If you are able to paint your bedroom, or entire apartment, use two shades of orange. In the beginning of the film, Molly's bedroom is striped with two shades of orange. The stripes are about six inches wide each. Molly's bedroom ceiling is midnight blue, with gold-leafed stars. Gold leaf is real gold, but spread thin, with a consistency similar to paint.
Use mainly orange and white shades. Make these colors your main palate. Mix in a bit of reds and pinks and purples as well. When using metal, gold is best. For windows, Molly has red velvet drapes. If this is too expensive, make your own, improvise; substitute fabrics, but not color. Stay as close to Molly's version as financially possible. Think warmth.
If your doors are white, leave them. Many of the doors in Molly's penthouse are white, or a deep brown.
Scatter your haven with candles. Molly has lots of candles, especially in the scene where Neal comes over. But be cautious, never be foolish with open flames.
Floor pillows are a must, use reds and purples and rich patterns or beading with floor pillows.;
, Molly hardly wears pants or shorts. We always see her in skirts or dresses. Wear skirts everywhere, even to go grocery-shopping or to the laundry-mat (like Molly does). Wear loose, swishy fabrics, like chiffon, or silk. Wear fun patterns, like paisley. And have at least one sequined dress (this is what Molly's wears to her birthday bash, a definite must for all Molly admirers). Color is also a big part of her wardrobe. A few dark pieces are alright, but keep them fun with little details, like dark patterns or dark shimmery fabrics. Molly also has a denim dress, covered in patches; if you can find one (in a thrift store, that's your best bet) buy it.

, Molly only wears fun shoes, or no shoes at all (like in the scene when she (temporarily) quits her job as a nanny and wanders around NYC barefoot). The pink shoes with stars that she wears at her birthday are great. If you can't find shoes like these, try pink shoes with feathers.

, Molly plays up her big eyes with either shimmery or black eye shadows and liners. Mascara in basic black, but also white or silver is a must.

, Be melodramatic about them. At the beginning of the movie, Molly HAS to have Neal. When he leaves her apartment, she cries and begs him to stay, then becomes delirious with love and doesn't clean her apartment.

, In one scene, Molly says 'I live off of water and sunshine!'. Make that your motto. Be happy and fun. Look for fun in every activity. But learn to be responsible too. This is something even our free-spirited Molly learns. Have fun, but learn fundamentals too.

",How to Cosplay Zoey Stevens from the Movie Zapped," It is shown in the movie that Zoey wore pink lip gloss on her mom's wedding and on her ""date"" with Jackson. On regular days, just wear all-natural lip balm or Chapstick to keep your lips healthy.;
, Zoey has a very unique sense of style, even when she's just simply at dance practice. Try wearing jumper pants, small jackets, knee-length skirts, and colourful tops. For shoes, wear girly sneakers and ankle boots.

, Try wearing gold chain necklaces, gold or silver hoop earrings, silver rings, and metallic bracelets. If you want to wear a watch, make it a gold, silver, or white watch.

, Wash it 3 days a week (more or less, depending on your hair type) with a good quality shampoo and conditioner. Let your hair air dry naturally, and then comb and brush your hair once it dried. Put in any hair styling products needed.

, In the movie, Zoey's nails are about 2 inches (5.1 cm) long and are painted white. Drink 3 glasses of milk a day to keep your nails strong, and paint them one plain colour instead of a bunch of different colors. One main, simple colour will really help with your outfits.

, Zoey loves to dance, especially hip hop. Try going to a dance school or join your school's dance team. If you don't want to, simply just freestyle dance to whatever song you hear on the radio!

, Simply just brush your teeth two times a day and rinse your mouth with mouthwash for 30 to 45 seconds. It will really help.

, Say ""please"" and ""thank you"" to people, help them out of situations, don't curse or swear to people. The basics of manners, really.

, In the movie, Zoey's best friend is Rachel. Making friends is actually easy. Just walk up to the person you want to be friends with, say ""Hi, my name is (whatever your name is), chat for a while, and then ask that person to be your friend.

, This is kinda optional, but if you want one, go for it!

, Wash your face two times a day with a cleanser and use a toner and moisturizer. Get 8 hours of sleep at night. You may wonder how that could possibly help your skin, but having no dark circles under your eyes can actually help your skin. So can eating healthy foods, and drinking 6-8 glasses of water a day. You can try natural masks and scrubs on your face once a month, if you want.

, Pick up your trash, pick up your dirty laundry, make your bed, keep your desk organized, and make sure there are no sticky substances in your room. If you have posters in your room, make sure they're straight, and are framed.

, After going back to school shopping, try making homemade covers on your binders, folders, and/or notebooks. There are many videos on YouTube on DIY School Supplies, so you can check those out. If you're not allowed on YouTube, you can just be original and do whatever comes to your mind.

Smile a lot and ""Keep your mind wide open""!,
Try to be calm, relaxed, gentle and in no hurry to grow up.,
Wear lots of layers- tights under capris, arm warmers and t-shirts, etc.,
Cut your hair short, if you would like.,
For accessories, you need army caps, arm warmers, and shoes like Leslie's.,
Express tomboy behavior like Leslie Burke from the movie was a tomboy.,
Have imagination!,
Be kind to everyone, even if they are mean to you.

,
Never bully anyone or brag about anything.,
Don't worry if you're lonely.",How to Be Like Leslie Burke," Also, have a special glow (be upbeat) and be happy. When you enter a room, try to brighten it up!;
, Don't be afraid to let your imagination run wild!

, Don't be afraid to clash colors and make interesting color combinations!

, Don't dye it because Leslie was all about being yourself, and dying your hair would imply that you don't like your original hair color.

, To make arm warmers, cut up socks (in the commentaries of the movie they said that the arm warmers were made of cut-up socks!). Those sweet shoes she wears are white Converse (Chuck Taylors). If you can't find white converse, then you can always bleach a pair. Customize them with different laces, baubles, etc.

, She wore clothes that weren't too girly, and easy to move in.

, Don't be hypocritical and pretend to always be picturing things when you're not, but think in your mind occasionally. ""this was really something else."" This is what Leslie would do. Another thing is to pretend that you're a fictional character. And if you're so inclined, find a space and make up a secret world!

,, Try to be innocent and don't act all snobby just because you got something that nobody else has.

, In the books, Leslie was described as lonely (until she met Jess). This doesn't mean to break away from your friends, but when you're along, enjoy your solitude and make something good out of it.

Be good at Math and Science.,
Be a total fashion designer.,
Jade has a double life.,
Don't be selective about your friends.,
Jade has black/brown hair.,
Don't go overboard with your makeup.,
Now you've mastered the looks and personality, it's time to think about the friends!,
Jade has many different hairstyles.",How to Be Like Jade from the New Bratz Movie," Jade is really good at math, and can add numbers really quickly. If you are bad at maths, keep practicing!!!! If you are bad at Science, keep practicing!!!! Seriously, do you think Jade divided the first time she picked up a pencil? Keep working on it!!;
, Jade can make almost anything! She goes to Home Ec classes, so you might want to as well. If you don't have material big enough for a human, you could buy a Bratz doll, and practice on that. If you don't have any material at all, you might want to start something like ""Barbie clothes cut them then your Barbie will be fashionable Throw any old doll clothes here!"" Then, you can cut them up, and get designing! Jade loves all kinds of fabric, so be creative!

, She wears plaid skirts and sweater vests in front of her parents, but when she gets to school, she changes into totally cool fashionable clothes. You don't have to do this, but you will be more like Jade if you do. When she is in her ""fashion"" clothes, she wears tight trousers, blue hair extensions, high heels, mini-dresses, leopard stilettos (they have laces which reach halfway up your leg) and tons of stuff like that!! In her closet, she has her ""plain"" clothes, but she also has a button which opens into her ""fashion"" closet.

, Jade spends her time with geeks, but calls them interesting people. Don't make fun of anyone, and be really kind. Jade is really accepting people for who they are.

, If your hair is blond, you don't have to dye it. It would make you more like Jade if you did, but if your parent/guardian doesn't want you to, or you feel uncomfortable about it, just get a wig. You may not want to wear it in P.E. at school, as it may fall off. Make sure to wear a wig cap. If your parent/guardian doesn't let you dye your hair, you can ask for highlights.

, OK, Jade does have a lot of black eyeshadow and mascara around her eyes, but you can pull the look off without your Mom screaming. Here's how:


Put a light shade of pink onto your eyelid. Don't put it up any farther.






Put a slightly darker shade (just a small bit) above. Then keep going, until you reach your eyebrow. Then come back down, but doing the opposite of what you did before. Put your lightest shade on the darkest, etc. etc. Then do the same on your other eyelid. Then, put some light eyeliner and mascara on. You should be starting to look a little like Jade.






Add a light touch of bronzer or bronze colour blush to your cheeks. Don't put it on anywhere but your apples (the part that sticks out when you smile). Add a lighter shade of brown, dissolving into your ears. If you have done this properly, your bronze should look a little darker than it really is. You can also use this technique for faking a tan.






For the lips, you can use any color! Depending on how dark you want the finishing result to be, you can choose from white to brown. What you should do, is put your shade on your lips, then use a darker shade for the outline. Put the darker shade on your lower lip, and your lighter one on your top lip. Then, smack them together, and you should have a darker shade. If you don't, then you may want to put a little more of the darker shade on your top lip.







, Jade has three BFF's: Yasmin, Sasha and Cloe. If anyone is like them in comparison, you my want to be their friend. If you are shy, try not to be shy! Think to yourself, that you are Jade, and she is the most sociable person ever!

, One minute it is loose, and includes blue extensions, and the next, it is cropped, and black. Not to mention brown in a side ponytail, and 4 plaits in each side (small ones, taken off from the top layer of hair). So get experimenting, girl! You can look through fashion magazines, you can surf the Internet (type Bratz Jade into Google images, and you should find loads of her looks. If none come up, you can also type Jade the Bratz movie), you can do anything to get the latest trends!!

Highlight the eyes by using eye shadow heavily.,
Use black eyeliner to make your eyes pop.,
Finish the eye makeup with black mascara.,
Wear pink or neutral lipstick or gloss.,
Go brunette and straight with your hair.",How to Look Like Adriana Lima1," Her blue-green-gray eyes are one of Adriana's most memorable features, and she usually uses pretty heavy makeup to bring them out. The key is to use shades of peach, black, and browns on the eyelid and under the lower lash line as well in the corner of the eye.


Take a pretty gray eye shadow. Sweep that under your brow area and on the inner corner of your eyes. It’s her eyes that she’s remembered for most.
Sweep a darker brown eye shadow on your lids. Add some bronze eye shadow in between the brown and white eye shadow on the lower eye. Add blue contacts to look more like Adriana if you don't have eyes her color.
The final eye shadow is black. Put that on top of the brown, but let the brown peak up from the corners.;
, Adriana favors black eyeliner, and she uses it to create a rock look. Shape your eyebrows, too, to further dramatize the eyes.


Put the black eyeliner in your eyes’ waterline, and in the corner of the eyes, as well as on top of the lash line.She suggests moistening the eyeliner pencil before applying.
Use an eyebrow pencil to create distinct, shaped brows. Her eyebrows are brown, and she has them neatly waxed and tweezed.

, She also has long and thick dark eyelashes. Curl your eyelashes with an eyelash curler.


She has said she never takes her mascara off. She just keeps adding to it. She puts it on top and bottom lashes. “The more you apply the better.”You might occasionally see Adriana without all of her heavy eye makeup when she is running errands, but she usually has a bit of mascara on even then.

, Finish off the look with pink lipstick. She models for a lip gloss company, so you could use that look.


She does not have dramatic lips, almost always favoring nude or pink shades of lipstick or lip gloss. Her trick is to emphasize the eyes, while downplaying the lips. Her top lip is smaller than her fuller lower lip.
Sometimes she takes a little red or pink lipstick and dabs it on her lips and cheek to give it a slightly tinted but natural look.
Use browner blush and brush it on the hollows of your cheek bone. Brush it on your temples too. It will make your face slimmer.

, Adriana is a dark brunette whose hair is chocolate-brown to almost black. You could get some slightly golden highlights, but not too dramatic. You’ll have to go dark to look like Adriana.


Use a hair straightener because she often wears her hair straight. Her hair is very clean and never overly styled. Sometimes she pulls it back.
She takes a flaxseed oil pill to keep her fair shiny and long. Check with your doctor first. To keep her hair healthy, she doesn’t wash it every day. Oils will help your hair look better.
If she styles her hair at all, she will create longer waves in her hair. When she wears her hair styled, it’s usually beachy hair waves. Try spritzing your hair with sea salt spray. Part your hair in the middle and wear it very long. Adriana’s hair often cascades past the bust line.

Find a great face wash. Victoria’s Secret Angels need to have great skin, so finding a face wash you love is very important.,
Don’t pluck your eyebrows.,
Contour your cheekbones.,
Apply a nude lip.,
Add a glow to your skin.",How to Look Like a Victoria's Secret Angel1," Find a face wash that works with your skin and make sure to use it every night before going to bed.If you have oily skin, look for an oil-free face wash.
If you have dry skin, look for milk, cream and oil cleansers.
If your skin is a combination of oily and dry, you can use any cleanser.;
, Thick, natural eyebrows are having a moment on the runway right now, so to emulate your favorite Angel, leave your eyebrows alone. If you have naturally thin eyebrows, try filling them in with an eyebrow pencil.Sculpt your eyebrows by running your eyebrow pencil up over the arch and out away from your face.
You can also pay to have your eyebrows tinted. The treatment will cost about $20 and will last 4-6 weeks.

, Pronounced cheekbones are a huge part of the Victoria’s Secret Angel look, and they have the power to completely change the shape and look of your face.Use your fingers to find the dip just below your cheekbones. Use a dark stick foundation to draw a line under your cheekbones, up to your hairline.
Blend the foundation, then dust the rest of your face with loose powder.

, Angels generally opt for a nude lip, so as not to draw attention away from the rest of their makeup. Look for a pink-nude lip gloss with a hydrating element to prevent your lips from getting too dry.Stay away from lipstick. Lipstick tends to be too messy for runway, so Angels avoid it.
Make sure to blot your lips to keep the shine to a minimum.

, Angels always look like they just got back from a tropical vacation, and you can too, with a little help from some makeup. Swap out your regular foundation for a tinted moisturizer or a bronzer with a light finish.Try brushing a little bronzer across your cheekbones, nose and forehead for an added glow.
Use a highlighter or illuminator above your cheekbones to make your skin appear dewier.

Don't be afraid to show off who you really are.",How to Be Like Lena from the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants," Lena is drop-dead gorgeous! In the book she has straight, shiny black hair and 'green eyes, roughly the color of celery.' In the movie, Lena has wavy, shoulder-length dark-brown hair, and electric blue eyes. Dye your hair a dark shade and straighten it. Get green colored contacts if you can. Only curl your hair on events that are very special.;
, She is said to have 'a bland uniform of J. Crew khakis'. Get clothes like her. In the movie, Lena wears very classical pieces, and almost always wears white clothes. Lena loves bland outfits such as a cardigan with a brown turtleneck and sandy pants. She also prefers sort of being seen but not heard. She is also tired of being called beautiful, so she wants her outfits to be drawing away from her.

, Lena is said to be the most maternal of the foursome. She is also very shy and thoughtful. She , like Carmen, wants her friends close. Lena is very sympathetic.

, Lena doesn't like to show off her beauty, and makeup would do just that. For very special occasions, she wears a little mascara. No eyeliner! For this girl, let your inner beauty shine!

, Lena doesn't try to hide her Greek heritage, even though her parents do. Travel to your homeland, if possible.

, Lena, for example, loves art- painting, sketching, etc. Let others see your skills and respect what you can do.

, After all, it's about what YOU love, not what others love!

Notice every detail.,
Be logical.,
Don't be idle.",How to Be Like Jamie Moriarty1," Moriarty doesn't just notice little details, she notices every detail. Symmetry, patterns and the little things that make a person tick. In any given situation, force yourself to focus all your attention on the details. However, this doesn't mean focus on boring details. When you first start to train your brain to do this you may be tempted to go for easy details such as counting the number of buttons on someone's shirt, but that detail is unlikely to matter. Instead, get in the habit of asking yourself questions about the situation and trying to answer them, such as:


""Is this person acting differently than usual? How are they different? What could be causing them to act like this?""
Do I smell something different? What kind of perfume/cologne do they use? Are there any other smells?
Are they lying? How do I know? What are they lying about? Why would they lie?
The ""trick"" to noticing details is to question absolutely everything. All those questions and their answers are as natural to Moriarty as breathing. She asks herself dozens of questions and comes up with their answers for absolutely everything, people, paintings, literature and business deals.;
,


Have a logical understanding of your skills. Know exactly what you can and can't do and to what degrees.
Make logical decisions, for each decision weigh up pros and cons. Do not let your feelings play a role in your decision-making process.
If you do find yourself too emotionally involved in anything, a deal or a person, make logical countermeasures to keep you level headed.

, For a brilliant mind like Jamie Moriarty's, mind-numbing activities like endless scrolling through Tumblr or daytime TV marathons would be akin to torture. Make sure the ways you spend your time benefit you in some way, even when not working.


Put your time spent online to good use. Don't mindlessly scroll through memes or fandom posts. Don't spend hours on Facebook. Don't troll people on 4chan. Use the internet to read up on things that interest you or find information. Better yet, try to get a little deeper into the net than just what Google has to offer. Try to teach yourself rudimentary hacking or check out the deep web.
Don't just read for the sake of saying you read. Either read something artful or read something with proper information. Put down the young adult fiction and read a classic or find a fascinating piece of nonfiction.
Overall, Moriarty can not be comfortable if her mind isn't busy. If you truly wish to be like her you can never let your mind rest.

Many men would like to look like the fitness models you see on TV and in the magazines.,
To help you answer the first question, I gladly refer you to the following documentary ""I wanna look like that guy"".,
As for the second question; You must realize that the guys with the rock hard bodies you see on TV and in the magazines have that body only for some period.,
Once you know the truth about how to be that muscular, and you are still willing to go for it you may proceed.

",How to Look Like a Male Fitness Model1," Before you start however, you will need to answer 2 questions.


Are you willing to pay the price for it.
Do you actually realize what you want.;
, During the documentary, the guy transforms himself from a chubby man into a true fitness model. It is a film without the nonsense products. It will show you what it takes to really become a fitness male model.

, There is nobody out there who is able to maintain a status of ""great shape"" for a long period. This is due to the fact that you will need to have a dangerously low fat percentage to look muscular, workout hard, eat well and take supplements. Something a human can not keep up with all his life.

Walk with perfect balance and grace like any vampire would.,
Hold your head up high to show you are not afraid of anything.,
Look like you don't care about anything.,
If you can, get dark red contacts to make the Jane look real.,
Put some pale make-up on your face to get the vampire effect.,
Wear dark, stylish clothes that look Victorian and vintage.,
If you really want to look like Jane dye your hair blonde and keep it up in bun or ponytail.,
When you get mad keep it in and don't start screaming.,
Be sarcastic with dark humor like Jane in New Moon when she says, ""This may hurt just a little.""",How to Be Like Jane from the Volturi," Jane is a vampire, therefore she is very graceful and steady on her feet. Make sure you practice having good posture.;
, Jane is very confident and sure of herself. You need to love yourself just the way you are, and knowing yourself is a very important task. Jane isn't shy and insecure, so to be more like Jane you need to appreciate who you are.

, A blank look on your face would work. Jane often doesn't seem to care about anything at all. She isn't enthusiastic often and keeps her emotions to herself. She is very reserved, so try keeping your thoughts only to you and make people want to know you better; don't spill it out to them. One of the biggest trait Jane has is how mysterious she is, so instead of not caring about anything, try acting upon that trait.

, Of course, that would be for a costume idea. If you want to act like Jane in your everyday life you shouldn't wear red contacts unless you feel obligated to, or if you feel confident with them on. If you don't like contacts, you don't need to wear them.

, Jane has very fair skin and wears dark eye makeup. You can find many tutorials that teach you how to have a Jane inspired makeup on the internet that can be a basic guideline on how to look like Jane. If you do not like makeup and do not want to wear it however, it is your choice. Whatever you feel comfortable with the better.

, If you are reading this article because you want to use it as a guideline for a costume, you should definitely wear a long, black robe that has a hood. If you are reading this article for an everyday look, you should try wearing black dresses, dark shirts and jeans, skirts, and antique looking jewelry. You do not need to wear very expensive and luxurious clothes; a lot of thrift shops have great pieces of clothing too that you can put together to make a marvelous outfit. Just stick to blacks, grays, dark reds, maybe emerald, etc.

, Jane usually wears her hair in a bun, but of course to integrate this look into an everyday fashion statement, a ponytail can look just fine. Her hair is always elegant to match her dark style, that is what you need to know. Find different ways to put your hair in buns and ponytails, get creative when you put your hair down, etc. If you do not wish to dye your hair blonde, though, you can always keep it your natural color. Jane in the books doesn't have blonde hair, it is light brown.

, Try to control yourself unless you get permission to get crazy mad. Jane, as said earlier, is very mysterious and reserved. She doesn't show her emotions very easily, and doesn't get furious over nothing. When you are angry, just calm down and keep it in, put on your best smile and try not to get it to you. If you really can't, stare at the person with the most hatred in your eyes as you possibly can. Jane is good at giving furious glances when she is mad, and always leave an impression. Practice to show your emotions in your eyes.

, Jane is very sarcastic and has a very sick and dark humor. Try fitting that in your everyday life, as she uses her sarcasm quite often.

Don’t starve yourself.",How to Look Like Adriana Lima3," Adriana is in great shape. She has to be. She’s a Victoria’s Secret model. She hired a professional nutritionist, though, to help her lose 50 pounds after she gave birth to her daughter.


Buy a scale. Hold yourself accountable for what you eat and how you let yourself go.She thinks high-intensity workouts are best. She likes to sweat and to jump rope. Ten minutes of jumping rope equals 35 minutes of running. She says you can burn 1,000 calories per hour long jumping rope session.

, To look as fit as Adriana, you have to clean up your diet. Eat a lot of steamed or raw vegetables, especially green ones like kale and broccoli. Season them with olive oil and sea salt.


She doesn’t snack. But if you must, eat fruit. She suggests blackberries and blueberries. She eats green vegetables usually, steamed or raw. Things like asparagus and spinach.
Eat every two to three hours. Drink at least two quarts of water daily. Take supplemental vitamins. If you get hungry, try a rice bar., When she’s about to go on a show, she works out twice a day with a personal trainer. She jumps rope, boxes, and lifts weights.


She also sees a nutritionist who measured her body’s muscle mass and levels of water retention. She drinks protein shakes, vitamins and supplements. She drinks a gallon of water every day. For nine days before the show, she drinks only protein shakes that include powder egg.
She was once quoted as saying that, two days before a fashion show, she stops drinking extra water. However, she claimed she was misquoted.

, Not only is this dangerous, but it’s not Adriana’s look, either. She stresses to her trainers that she wants to retain some curves.


One exercise she did to get into shape after she had her baby is called the Aerosquat. To perform it, bend down. Touch the index and middle finger of both hands to the ground. Keep your hands on the opposite sides of your left foot.
While keeping your knee bent, raise your right foot off the ground. Tilt your weight to your left side. Squat with your left leg. Keep your fingers touching the ground. Straighten your leg again. Repeat for one minute per leg on both legs the first day, then 30 seconds per leg on both legs the second day. Try this daily.The move will lift the butt and sculpt your upper quad. She thinks drinking a lot of water and exercising regularly are very important. Water is a natural detox."

Apply big waves to your hair.,
Curl your hair early.,
Condition your hair before shampooing.",How to Look Like a Victoria's Secret Angel2," Angels generally favor long, bombshell curls for their walks down the runway, and you can easily achieve the same look by investing in a curling iron and some hairspray.Before blow-drying your hair, use your fingers to comb a body-building mousse through your hair.
If your hair is short, clip in extensions. If your hair is long, skip this step.
Curl your hair using one-inch sections. Curl the portions by your hairline away from your face.
Gently tease your hair using a boar bristle brush.
Spray your hair with a flexible hold hairspray to hold the do in place., Angel hair usually skews more towards beach waves than ringlets, and the secret to achieving the former look is time. The longer your hair is curled, the more time it has to fall and look natural.Curl your hair several hours before you plan to go out. This will give curled hair time to relax into beachy waves.
Add a pinch of salt water spray to the roots of your hair to increase volume.

, Conditioner is great for making hair soft, but it also tends to weigh hair down. To combat this, apply conditioner before washing your hair.If you have fine hair, use a basic shampoo and conditioner.
If you have dry hair, forgo conditioner in favor of a pre-shampoo oil treatment.

"
"
Eat a clean diet.,
Find a workout that you love.,
Cut out alcohol.",How to Look Like a Victoria's Secret Angel3," Angels are known for their amazing bodies – after all, their work clothes are lingerie- and their diets reflect this. There is no clear diet for an Angel body, but all models stress healthy eating.For breakfast, eat something high in protein, like Eggs Benedict or oatmeal.
For lunch, eat a protein like chicken or fish, with some vegetables and fruit.
For dinner, eat sushi and rice.
Occasionally treat yourself to carbohydrates and desserts, but eat them in moderation.

, Eating right is not enough; to have the lean, toned body of an Angel, you’ll also have to make working out a priority. Angels differ in their preferred exercise regimens, but they all have found methods of working out that they really enjoy.For long, lean muscles, try yoga, pilates and ballet.
To burn fan, try biking, running or boxing.

, Some Angels will cut out alcohol in the month preceding a big show. Reducing alcohol intake is a great way to cut empty calories, and will also go a long way towards improving the quality of your skin.In addition to cutting out alcohol, make sure to drink water every day.
Drinking a half-gallon of water will aid in digestion and help cut tummy bloat.

"
"
Pick the right underwear for your body.,
Choose comfortable clothing.,
Never leave the house without wearing sunglasses.,
Never forget the heels.",How to Look Like a Victoria's Secret Angel4," Angels spend most of their time at work rocking lingerie, so they know a thing or two about picking out underwear. Avoid lingerie that is on trend and instead pick undergarments that flatter your body-type.If you have an apple shaped body, look for bodysuits with deep V-necks.
If you have an athletic body, try a halter neck bra with matching thong.
If you're busty, look for fashionable underwire options and pair them with high waisted briefs.
If you're short waisted, look for low-rise bikinis.
If your body is wider on top, try a baby-doll chemise.
If you have a small chest, try a racerback bralette., Angels are used to working it on the runway, so it stands to reason that off the runway, they look for clothing that is comfortable, while still being stylish.Look for skinny jeans and boyfriend jeans that make your legs look long and lean.
Look for fun basics, like leggings and tunics, that you can easily mix and match.

, Sunglasses are functional – they protect your skin from the sun and keep fans from recognizing you on the street – but they’re also very stylish and add some sophistication to even the most casual of outfits.Look for classic styles, like aviators and half-frame sunglasses.
If you're wearing a show-stopping pair of sunglasses, choose a subdued outfit to balance them out.

, The average Victoria's Secret Angel is 5'9"", so adding heels to your outfit is a guaranteed way to get one step closer to the runway. In addition to classing up your outfit, heels help improve your posture and are a great workout for your calves and butt.Spring for a stiletto. The higher the heel, the better.
If you're breaking in a new set of heels, walk around in them at home to get comfortable before trying them out in public.

Be practical with an appreciation for quality and artistic flair.,
Buy suitable work-out clothing.,
Buy a suit for business endeavors.,
Chose your casual daywear carefully.,
Style your hair and makeup in Moriarty's style.",How to Be Like Jamie Moriarty2,"


Moriarty has exquisite taste. Her clothes are good quality, expensive and most likely designer.
Since you're looking up how to be like Jamie Moriarty we are going to assume you aren’t a billionaire...yet. So consider saving to buy some staple clothing pieces.

, One doesn’t look like Jamie Moriarty without quite a few hours in the gym, and her occupation requires a certain level of fitness. As such she would need a nice set of workout clothing,


Jamie isn’t exactly the modest type so your outfit should be revealing yet tasteful. A tank top or sports bra with some long yoga pants would work.
As for price range, workout clothes ruin quickly, so there's no sense spending too much on them. Consider Lulu Lemon or some other vaguely expensive brand.

, A nice suit is an essential staple of any businesswomen's wardrobe, especially a woman like Jamie Moriarty. Expensive restaurants won’t even let you in without a nice suit and no associate would take a business partner seriously if they wore jeans.


You can’t avoid spending on this one. All the other outfits on this list you can substitute with cheaper brands as long as you get the style right. However, a cheap suit costs around $200/£160.
For this step, where you are in your life matters. If you are still in high school or a first-year college student perhaps skip the suit until you're ready to enter the business world where you will need a suit.
Consider buying a suit worth around $1000/£660. Jamie probably spends more on hers, but a $1000/£660 suit that is well tailored gets the point across that you have money and you mean business.
Of course, just because a suit is worth $1000/£660 doesn’t mean you have to spend $1000/£660. If you're tight on cash there are plenty of ways to use that Moriarty charm to get a deal. Don’t mention you're tight on cash, mention you need the suit for a first-time business venture. (For example, a Law student going for an interview at their first firm.) Then once you find a suit you love, play coy and suggest the salesperson could knock a few hundred off. Salespeople in high-end stores make their living on commission.
As for the style of the suit, go for nice yet subdued colors: a black top paired with a deep blue or purple suit, the kind of deep colors found a Samy Charnine or a Van Gogh. Add a harsh geometric cut for the full effect.
Pair this exquisite suit with a long thin stiletto in a matching color.

, Casual Moriarty daywear is pretty simple but contains multiple pieces.


Everyday outfits consist of loose blouses in deep blues or purples. The occasional pastel or perhaps a red works well too. Pair these with black slacks and a low heel. Never wear sweatpants. You never know when someone might come knocking on your door so you must look good.
In the colder months you’ll need a nice trench coat. Find something in a warm practical fabric which is a dark color like a black or dark gray and calf length.
You may also need an outfit for more strenuous activities like hiking or investigating a murder. For this find a nice leather jacket pair with a black singlet and black pants. Leather is good for protecting yourself from falls or even knives. For shoes pick something dark with thin yet sturdy sole.

,


Moriarty's hair is easy. For business go for an elaborate updo. For a personal call, wear your hair down in neat curls. For something physical put your hair in a sleek ponytail.
As for makeup Jamie knows how to keep her look natural while emphasizing her features. Makeup is like painting so naturally she’s brilliant at it.

"

Train yourself to react with secondary emotions, not primary.,
Limit your facial expressions.,
Moriarty is a skilled liar and her face will not betray her.",How to Be Like Jamie Moriarty3," Doing this is a very good way to seem cold and emotionless but is a lot more workable than trying not to feel anything.


Act with lust, affection and longing instead of love.
Act in a contented way with pride and enthrallment instead of joy.
Use rage, irritation and exasperation instead of anger.
Act with shame and disappointment instead of sadness.

, The lack of expressions are a key feature of Moriarty's face, for instance:


Moriarty's face is usually set in a cold blank look when thinking or explaining things, but she finishes each sentence with a coy smile or smirk. This is a calculated manipulation tactic as most facial expressions don't come naturally to her.

, She is also blunt and to the point. However, she may act coy to get a point across or as another manipulation tactic.


Moriarty will always tell people what she wants, with absolutely no shyness or doubt.

Get in shape.,
Have natural looking hair.,
Wear the clothes you'd expect to see one of the Hollister models in.,
Don't overload on the makeup.,
If you really want to, you could decorate your room like a Hollister shop.,
Be happy.,
Skin and Teeth.",How to Look Like a Hollister Model (for Girls)," Most of the Hollister girls are toned and in shape. They are not stick thin or very curvy. Most people think of exercising as sweating and huffing and puffing. You can exercise while having fun. Some example are: surfing, dancing, running, walking, swimming or going to the gym. Some people won't even notice that they are exercising.


Another good idea is to make a 20 minute exercise plan. In this plan you could put in crunches, lunges, lifting weights and press ups. Do it around 5 times a week otherwise you will get bulky muscles, and you don't want that.
Don't go on a strict diet but remember not to overload on fatty foods and sugary foods. Remember to drink 8 glasses of water and eat 5 fruits and veggies daily.;
, A good hair color is your natural color, with blond highlights that look like you've been on the beach all day. When you are happy with your hair color, find the style. One way to prevent having un-natural hair is to not straighten you hair too much, if it's curly. Doing this too often will make the color fade away. It's OK once in a while, but not everyday.


Most of the workers have long hair with a few layers and a grown out side bang. Hair shouldn't look over styled, so pretty much stick with your naturally flowing style. Also, you shouldn't put in any product that you don't use everyday.
Try a leave in conditioner, just no mousse, gel, or too much hairspray. You could also french-plait it after a shower and when it's dry take it out. When you put your hair up, put it in a ponytail or plaits.

, The models wear Hollister, but also have things that aren't from Hollister. Get some basic items (from any store) including: tank tops, flip flops or bags. Hollister employees rarely wear any jewelry other than a pair of earrings and sometimes they get away with a watch or a bracelet. Don't overload on too many slogan tees, cardigans are very popular amongst the models working at Hollister. They usually wear a simple white tank underneath or a v neck.

, Try to keep things natural. Hollister models are only allowed to wear mascara and some cover-up if needed. You can wear a light gloss or balm to the lips to keep them moisturized and healthy looking as they do as well; but just keep everything light and natural/ beachy looking.

, Make sure your parents approve before you do. Plus shop at places that sell chic but cheap things as it will be costly.

, Smile and talk to everyone. Don't hold grudges and don't judge people by their appearance. Sometimes the Hollister workers do, but those workers are not liked by everyone. Remember to be confident in what you wear and make sure it's comfortable. Most of the models wear their clothes by comfort and it always looks stylish.

, Hollister is a very diverse working place, and the models that are hired usually have really good skin and fairly good teeth. Drink plenty of water, and stay away from fast foods to improve the appearance of your skin. Also, if you're fairly active, you probably already have fairly good skin. Be sure to brush your teeth after every meal to have nice pearly whites.

Find a good exercise program and stick with it.,
Change your wardrobe.,

Keep your makeup subtle.,
Don't wear a lot of jewelry!,
Carry around a beach tote, preferably from Hollister.,

Get a tan.,
Finish off the whole look with good posture.",How to Look and Feel Like a Hollister Model (Bettys)," You can find a sport you enjoy or even a dance. If sports aren't your thing, try BeachBody exercise programs. Especially the ""Yoga-Booty-Ballet"" which helps you feel GREAT about yourself.;
, Hollister Co. Models are either required to wear all HCO. clothes, which is the easiest, or have a strict wardrobe:

Bottoms have to be denim shorts, skirt, or jeans.






Jeans can be Abercrombie or from another company, but only if there is no distinct pocket design or label.
Tops have to be in white, gray, or navy.






Shoes have to be neutral-colored or leather flip-flops. Depending on the Hollister near you, Vans and Converse are acceptable.






By all means you DO NOT have to dress according to this policy. The policy will help you look more authentic Hollister, but if you don't work there there's no point in stressing over what to wear. Hollister Co. is all about the laid back surfer look. That means that shorts and tank-tops are your new BFF's.

, The models at Hollister are required to make their hair look like it came from their own head. You can't straighten your bangs and then curl the rest of your hair. Keep your hair down and, if possible, always natural. Deep condition and trim it often to keep it fresh and healthy.

, This is a stake to the heart when a teenage girl hears this, but it's what keeps the look laid-back. You should only need:

Foundation






Concealer






Powder






VERY light eye makeup






Lip balm







, Small diamond studs and a ring or bracelet are more than enough, as you don't want to look too overdone. Only wear a clear coat of nail polish if you want to wear any at all, and keep your nails manicured nicely. Don't get acrylics or any colored nail polish, as this doesn't look natural and looks a bit too done-up.

, It's less fancy than a purse and it's more pretty than a backpack.

, This is the Hollister Model's secret to being a true Cali Girl. Brush your teeth regularly and keep some mints in your beach tote. Get braces and have your teeth whitened to keep them looking as perfect as possible.

, Nothing says ""I feel good about myself!"" more than a healthy glow. Don't stay in the sun too long or you'll be way to sunburned to put on your HCo. clothes. Be careful not to spend too much time in the sun, or this can cause potentially fatal problems later in life. Try using a self-tanning lotion, they are better for your skin than the harmful UV rays from the sun or a tanning bed. Some tanning lotions even have moisturizers! However, if you are very fair skinned naturally, just embrace your skin color, and do not ruin it with damaging or fake-looking tans.

, Having good posture will boost your confidence and will help you have less back problems in the future.

Get the clothes.,
Get the style.,
Get the makeup.,
Act Like a Lady.No matter how you dress, do your hair or do your makeup, you cannot pull of the J.,
Overall Appearance: Female J.,
Pick up a J.",How to Look Like a J. Crew Model," Obviously, if you want to look like a J.Crew model, it would be very helpful if you actually shopped at J.Crew. However the store can be quite expensive, and so if you don't think you can afford a whole new wardrobe from there, then try picking up a J.Crew catalogue from your local store or online, and attempt to find cheaper pieces from other brands that closely resemble what you might see in the catalogues. Some staple clothing items to have around should include:


Light sweaters or cardigans, slouchy tee shirts with subtle detailing in pastel or happy colors or artsy designs, elegant dresses for nice occasions, a beach dress, oxfords, frilly camis, V-neck tees, a pair of leather flip-flops, chino shorts in khaki as well as a bright color, brightly colored flats, a pair of heels that go with anything
A coat in a bright color.;
, Try wearing happy colors all the time and never wear black. J.Crew models also like to wear a single piece of bright clothing against several more subtle ones. (For example, a bright yellow clutch purse with pastels.) Also, before you attempt to buy anything from J.Crew, you must understand that the store is designed for women (and men) of many different ages. Therefore, some of the pieces in the store may be intended for an older women, and no model wants to look older than they're supposed to.

, J.Crew models are clean-faced and classy. They do not under any circumstances wear bright eyeshadow, dark eyeliner, caked foundation, or false eyelashes. Anything that looks fake or unnatural is completely un-preppy. Try wearing minimal makeup. Use concealer sparingly to even skin, a light pink blush for that ""innocent"" appearance, and mascara. (Double check to make sure that the mascara is not clumpy at all, and that the concealer is not noticeable whatsoever.) It is also OK to wear eyeliner if you really need it, but take care to make sure the line is thin and very close to your upper eyelashes only. You want people to notice your eyes, not the eyeliner itself.

, Crew look unless you ACT like J. Crew material. Always walk tall, walk slowly, with purpose and with your head up. Sit with your shoulders back and legs together. Do J. Crew models look like they've been rushing around or would be caught sitting with slouched shoulders or showing their underwear? Also, ditch the ""ghetto slang"" and speak like you were raised by the Queen - with good grammar, pronunciation and like you have something important to say. Be warm and kind to others, never bossy or demanding. Above all, keep your cool in all situations. A J. Crew model would never cry and stomp around or have a fit. Acting classy is the most essential element in pulling off the J. Crew look.

, Crew models, of late, are looking more like college students who are in the midst of finals, who haven't bathed, and whose hygiene is questionable. Their hair is contrived to look ""messy"" and their poses are surly. Shirt-tails are not tucked in, they stand pigeon-toed to affect innocence, boots that have laces are untied....the list goes on and on. In essence, J. Crew models appear as if they are trying too hard to be *cool* without being *cool.* Male models in J. Crew have been sporting five o'clock shadows, now, for some 8 or more years - sort of like the Farrah Fawcett hairdo that simply won't go away. When, oh when, are they going to feature clean-shaven men? The tired Don Johnson phase of no socks and unshaven faces has run its course.

, Crew catalog from about 8-9 years ago, and there you will find a distinct classiness that has since disappeared.

Search the internet for pictures of Darth Vader to use as guides.,
Make a list of everything you will need.,
Purchase inexpensive black clothing.,
Make or buy boots and gloves.",How to Make a Darth Vader Costume1," Use a search engine such as Google or Bing for pictures of Darth Vader that show his entire body, as well as close-ups of different parts of his costume (e.g. mask, cape, suit). Use these as a guide when purchasing or finding supplies.;
, You want to make sure you are prepared and acquire any necessary materials or supplies you might not have at home. Divide the costume into 6 sections: helmet, dark clothes, dark boots, dark gloves, cape, and accessories.


Decide what type of costume you want - something that is 100% accurate, something that is comfortable, or something that is quick and easy to make.
Decide what parts of the costume you can make at home, and what you need to buy from a toy or costume store.

, Black is Darth Vader's signature color, and black clothing is a key element of the costume. You can save money by buying black clothing from a thrift store. You will need a long-sleeve shirt or sweatshirt, sweatpants or cargo pants, and socks.


Think about where you will be wearing the costume when selecting clothing items. Purchase heavy, bulkier clothes if you plan on wearing it outside as a Halloween costume. For a costume party, look for cotton items that are thin and loose to help keep you comfortable indoors.
If you are planning on adding armor or padding (e.g. football pads) underneath your clothes to give you a muscular look, consider buying things in a size or two larger than you normally wear.

, You will need thick black gloves and boots. As a result of his deformities, Darth Vader kept his body covered-up at all times, including his hands and feet.Motorcycle gloves and boots work very well because they are big, thick, and typically black. Large leather or pleather gloves, and/or cheap black snow boots work as well. You can also make your own ""boot"" covers to wear over your shoes. Here are the directions:


You can sew your own boot covers using pleather material, 1/4 inch elastic, and a sewing machine.Make a pattern by tracing your shoe and pants from the bottom of the sole to your knee. Do this for your right and left leg.
Trace the pattern onto your fabric, making sure to include the width of the shoe at the toes and heels, and adding fabric as needed. Leave a 1/2 inch of fabric along one side for a seam. Do this twice for each side and then cut-out your tracings.
Sew the two halves together for each boot, only sewing along the sides and keeping the top and bottom open.
Cut four pieces of elastic that are the same length as the bottom of your boot. Place one end of the elastic near the right seam and the opposite end next to the left seam. Secure with flat pins and machine stitch elastic to the bottom of your boot. Put the boots on by pulling them over your shoes and pants.

Cut out cardboard shapes from the cereal boxes to make Darth Vader's face.,
Deflate the balloon and cut out holes for the eyes and mouth.,
Spray paint the helmet and add the final details.",How to Make a Darth Vader Costume2," Paper mache is a great for making a helmet that is 3-dimensional, hollow, durable and light-weight.While you can always buy a Darth Vader helmet from a toy store or costume store, making one from paper mache is easy and fun.You will need:


Newspaper
Paper mache mix (1 part flour to 5 parts water)
Saucepan
Mixing bowl
Balloon
3-4 empty cereal boxes
Masking tape
Recycled plastic container
Hot glue and glue gun
Black spray paint
High gloss spray varnish

, Mix together 1 part flour to 5 cups water in a Saucepan. Boil for three minutes and let cool. This method produces an even, smooth paste.You can also add equal parts water and flour, and then stir together in a mixing bowl.
Do not add salt to the mixture as it makes the paper mache difficult to mold.

, You will use the balloon to create the base of your paper mache sculpture/helmet. Inflate the balloon and place it in a plastic bucket to prevent it from moving around. Add a single layer of paper mache to the balloon by dipping strips of newspaper into the paste and sticking them directly onto the balloon. Let everything dry before starting the next step.


Paper mache can get messy. Use a flat working surface, such as a table or kitchen floor, and spread newspaper over the entire area before you begin.

, Build-up the face by cutting-out geometric shapes (squares, rectangles, triangles, and circles) and attaching them to the paper mache base using masking tape or hot glue. Once you are finished modeling Darth Vader's features with cardboard, add another layer of paper mache and let dry.


Don't forget to create a visor that sticks-out over the eyes and juts out from the side of the face.
Darth Vader breathes through a triangle-shaped respirator that projects out from his face and covers his nose and mouth.

, Carefully remove the bottom and back of the mask and use a pin to pop the balloon. Add additional paper mache to smooth out any rough edges or fill any gaps. Let dry before cutting-out two wide pie-shaped holes for the eyes, and a triangular hole in the respirator for the mouth.


Cut-out plastic strips from a recycled container and glue over the mouth to create the vented slats of the mouthpiece.

, Spray the entire helmet with black pray paint followed by a high gloss varnish. Poke a hole on either side of the helmet in the back string a piece of elastic through them to hold the mask in place.


After you are finished painting, use hot glue to attach lenses from old sunglasses over the eyes.

Hem the collar and bottom of the cape and add velcro.",How to Make a Darth Vader Costume3," Measure yourself in three places: while wearing shoes or boots, measure the distance from the nape or your neck to the floor; stretch your arms to the side and measure the distance between your finger tips; and measure the circumference of your neck at its base. Bring them with you when you go to the fabric store, and ask someone to help you determine how much fabric you need to purchase.


Allow yourself extra fabric, about 2.5-3 inches on two sides, for hemming.
Fabric is usually sold by the yard.

, You can find patterns for a basic super hero cape online or at a fabric store.If you don't know how to use a sewing machine, there are a variety of cape designs available for different skill levels. Additionally, Darth Vader's cape is different from a standard super hero cape in that it doesn't ""swoosh"". You want to use heavy fabric to weigh the cape down. For a basic cape design, you will need:


At least 1 yard heavy black fabric (this is to make a child's costume, adults will need more based on height and weight)
At least 1 yard additional fabric if you decide to include a lining.
Pattern paper
All-purpose black thread
2-3 inches of velcro
Erasable fabric marking pen or chalk
Sewing machine

, Using chalk or an erasable fabric marking pen, transfer the pattern from the paper onto the fabric. Adjust the pattern to accommodate your measurements (height from nape of neck to floor, and width of outstretched arms). Measure the width at the base of your neck to determine the collar size, adding several extra inches for comfort. When finished, cut-out the fabric.


Repeat this step if you want to add a lining to your cape.
Alternatively, you can draw, cut-out, and then sew two semi-circles together.Fold the fabric in half and pin together. Double your neck-to-floor measurement and mark it on the fabric, leaving about 2 inches from the base of the semi-circle to the edge of the material. Use a piece of chalk attached to a string to draw a perfect arch. Cut the material out. In the center, draw and cut-out a smaller semi-circle for your neck. Use a sewing machine to stitch the two halves together.

, Use a sewing machine to hem the collar and bottom of the cape using a simple double-fold hem.Fold the fabric over about 1/2 inches, and then fold it again another 1/2 inches. Secure with straight pins. Sew the hem about 1/8 inch from the second folded edge. When done, flatten the hem with an iron.


When taking initial measurements for your cape, you want to add several extra inches for a hem. Hemming your cape will make it more durable and prevent the edges from fraying.
Secure the collar together by sewing or gluing a 2-3 inch piece of velcro on each side. If your cape is heavy, you might need a slightly larger piece of velcro.

Give yourself 10 to 15 minutes to get into the costume.,
Put padding on first (optional).,
Put on the black pants and long-sleeve shirt.,
Tuck your pants into the boots and put on your gloves.,
Add the cape and helmet.,
Add a lightsaber or make your own.,
Make your own control panel.,
Breathe deeply and make rasping noises.",How to Make a Darth Vader Costume4," Try everything on separately first to make sure it fits. Make any necessary adjustments before putting your costume on. Make sure you have everything you need to become Darth Vader. This includes: padding (optional), helmet, black long-sleeve shirt and pants, black cape, black gloves, and black boots.

, While padding is not necessary, it adds bulk and gives the impression of muscles. You can use old football or hockey gear, such as shoulder and chest pads, shin guards, and/or an athletic girdle. To avoid chafing, you should wear a t-shirt and briefs under the pads.If wearing one, put the athletic girdle or shapewear on first.Next, position the shoulder pads so they are comfortable and have someone help you secure them in the front and back.Finally, tie or strap-on knee of shin guards.


Pads can be bulky and make it difficult or uncomfortable to move around in. If you are not used to them, practice wearing them around the house for a few hours over several days.
Use duct tape (attached to clothing - not skin) to help secure pads that feel loose or shift too much.
Sports equipment is expensive. If you do not have pads of your own, ask to borrow them from a friend or check a second-hand store or consignment shop for clean used items.

, You pants and long-sleeve shirt or sweatshirt should fit snugly but not be too tight. If you decide not to wear pads, but still want to create a bulky look, consider wearing a thick sweatshirt or layer several shirts. You can do the same for pants - wear two pairs of sweatpants, or pull black sweatpants over a regular pair of jeans.


Layering clothing is also a good idea if you will be wearing the costume outside in cold weather.

, Pull your boots up over your pants or tuck your pants into your boots. If necessary, lace-up and tie your boots before putting on your gloves. If you made boot covers, you can simply pull them over your sneakers. Try walking around. Stamp your feet when you walk so you look more intimidating.

, Tie or Velcro your cape around your neck. Adjust it so it is comfortable and not too tight. For the final touch, put on your helmet. Make sure your helmet fits properly and you can comfortably see and breathe. Try walking around your house to get a feel for the costume before going out.

, If you have a lightsaber, carry it around by tucking it into a belt. You can also make your own lightsaber using a foam pool noodle.Use a knife to cut the pool noodle in half. Wrap silver duct tape about a quarter of the way around one of the ends. Finally, use black electrical tape to wrap three horizontal rings around the top of the silver tape, and two vertical strips between the horizontal rings and bottom of the silver tape.

, Darth Vader wore a control panel on his chest that monitored his vital signs and bodily functions.You can complete your costume by painting or spray-painting a cardboard box black. Next, create buttons and switches by either drawing them on with different colored metallic paint pens, or gluing buttons, beads, game pieces, or toothpaste caps to the front of the box. Use black duct tape to attach the control panel to your shirt, or tie black yarn or rope to each side and wear around your neck .

, Darth Vader was equipped with mechanical lungs and a ventilator following his near-fatal battle with Obi-Wan Kenobi. As a result, his breathes are very loud and raspy. In Episodes Iv, V, and VI, Darth Vader was voiced by the actor James Earl Jones. Despite his heavy breathing, his voice is deep and commanding.Prepare yourself by watching the movies in which Darth Vader appears. These include: Star Wars Episodes III, IV, V, and VI.Record yourself talking like Darth Vader. When in full costume, practice walking, talking and moving like him in front of a mirror.

Understand that Valeria is a New Age guru.,
Be thankful for your food.,
Eat lots of vegetables.,
Take care of your nutrients.,
Drink lots of water.,
Consult your doctor about your diet.,
Exercise.,
Imitate Valeria's makeup.,
Wear clothes that make you feel cute and doll-like.,
Don't take her looks too seriously.,
Recognize and accept the limits of your body.",How to Be Like Valeria Lukyanova," She can often be seen with ""bindi"" on her forehead - the Indian decoration that symbolizes the purity of one's mind. She teaches spirituality and finding your own right way in life, anti-alcohol philosophy, and much more. She's interested in out-of-body experiences, breatharianism, and spirituality in general. She's an educator at ""the school in which the instructors show students how to leave their physical body and travel in their spiritual body"" (her own words).


Watch some of her seminars on Youtube or go to the local library and borrow a book about New Age practices, out-of-body experiences, lucid dreaming, and things like that. You might find a new interest.
Consider meeting Gurus like Valeria and attending classes they offer. You can also meet people online and talk about spiritual experiences or learn something new from them.;
, Take time to eat your meal slowly and chew every single bite. Your food is your fuel and your medicine. Appreciate it. This will help you enjoy your food more, and it will keep you from overeating.

, Valeria maintains her incredible weight and body fat percentage with her clean diet. She has said that in order to be healthy and beautiful, you have to eat vegetables and herbs. Eat small portions 5-6 times a day. Eat any kind of fruit and vegetable - kale, cabbage, carrots, lentils, beans, apples, oranges ... The ideas and recipes are numerous.


If needed, you can add a small amount of lean meat and dairy products. Valeria prefers a vegetarian, raw food diet, but if you are not comfortable with being vegetarian, feel free to add into your diet anything that's healthy and clean.

, Make sure you eat enough proteins! If you don't eat meat, eat lentils, beans, peas, spinach, broccoli and corn. If you wish, you can eat meat substitutes like tofu and seitan. They are super healthy and contain proteins.


Eat oats, nuts, almonds and hazelnuts. They contain fatty acids and are a perfect snack.

, Drink at least 8 glasses a day. Every morning when you wake up, drink a big glass of water - your body needs it after you have slept. Continue drinking throughout the day to remain hydrated and healthy.


Water helps flush the toxins from your organism and, along with a nutritious diet, makes your skin, hair and nails pretty and healthy.

, Tell him what you're currently eating, and consider providing him with a food diary listing everything you eat in a week. He might give you some food supplements and vitamins to make sure that you are as healthy as possible.

, Not only is Valeria thin, but she is also extremely fit. Event though Valeria's exact workout plan isn't known, there are some obvious things that you can do in order to look similar to her. Try jogging for basic cardio work, do basic weight training to boost your metabolism and improve your strength, or perform high intensity interval training, which burn lots of fat and are considered the most efficient way to work out.

, She is known for her Barbie doll look. Search for some tutorials on Youtube that will help you achieve her look. Such tutorials teach you how to exaggerate your eyes, make your skin look flawless, change the shape of your lips, and much more. These are all methods that Valeria uses. There are many photos of her with and without makeup and the difference is enormous.

, These can include cute, patterned dresses, tight-fitting shirts to show off your figure, and accessories such as hair-bows and wreaths.

, Valeria indeed says some right and positive things about spirituality, but even Valeria doesn't look in real life like she looks in photos. In the interview for V Magazine, she said: ""I won’t deny that I play along with people’s perceptions. I’m amused by the reactions. I don’t take it seriously.""

, Valeria's proportions are one of a kind and not completely natural: she has admitted to getting breast implants. It's impossible to fit a 34DD bra and have an 18-inch waist naturally, so don't feel bad if you can't achieve this. Shoot for more realistic, healthy goals instead. Don't compare yourself to her, and don't strive for a figure as drastic as hers. As long as you are fit and healthy, you should be perfectly satisfied with your own body.


Work out and eat healthy to get your own, unique figure and stay true to yourself.

Express yourself.,
Most importantly, be intelligent.",How to Look Like Luna Lovegood," If you're not, then explore new things, try new things. Start by considering new ways of thinking, and then explore them. Luna's open-mindedness was one of her strongest qualities. Always trust the people you care about, and never shut anything out based on logic.;
, Even in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, she managed to remain calm. Don't ever panic or get frustrated about anything. A lot of people will tell you to practice meditation to calm yourself down, and while it's a very calming experience for a few minutes, it can get boring. Do whatever works to keep yourself calm and if you're about to panic, just tell yourself that everything will always work out somehow.

, Speak about any of your ideas and opinions in class. Luna shares what she thinks with people through the series. Even no matter how strange or on the contrary it is. Don't care what others may think. Oh and remember to follow the above step (stay calm). Luna was never angry or ""strong"" on her points and ideas. Just act natural.

, Though you should listen to people when they're talking to you, if you don't find a conversation interesting, feel free to think of something you find more interesting.

, You don't have to be Monet, but a little drawing once in a while can be fun, and if you really try, you never know, you might come out with something quite impressive.

, Luna's quirky fashion sense was one of her trademarks, so if you find a particular hairstyle, make up style, or item of clothing nice, then don't hesitate to wear it. No matter what people say, you are you and have the right to wear what you want. Fashion isn't just something to make you look good to Luna, it's a way of expressing yourself. If you do want to emulate Luna's clothing based on the movie, then you may want to wear layers such as cardigans, light jackets, skirts, tights, and sneakers. Wear what ever colors you wish. Luna was all about color and mismatching. She had very unique hand-made jewelry as well.

, If you are someone who is a follower, it's time to step away from your group. Just because a lot of girls are in cliques doesn't mean you have to be in one!

, Think with your head and not your heart. Get good grades. After all, she was a Ravenclaw.

Try some non-fiction books, like history about your school or town. For fiction, try the classics, or realistic fiction, Hermione would read the most realistic books (but Harry Potter works, too). You can get an old fashion book bag that's maybe tan or light brown. Sling it over your shoulder when carrying it.;
, Hermione is an avid reader and will read up on all sorts of subjects. When you go to the library, consider perusing the non-fiction section on subjects such as philosophy, history, culture, science, animals, literature. Reading widely will make you a more cultured and refined person.

, Hermione is extremely organized. She does more subjects than anyone else in the grade, yet she seems to have time to read widely, advocate for the welfare of elves and helps friends such as Hagrid in need. Hermione has a homework planner and good work ethic.

, Hermione has an innate curiosity to learn and better her mind. She approaches her studies with interest, which allows her to better immerse herself.


Value education, learning and culture. Hermione values these traits in her education. Try to enjoy them; they might even be fun!

, Hermione takes more challenging and varied subjects than others, however the result is that she comes out with a well-rounded knowledge. However be wary of a heavy workload, while Hermione is very good, even the best of people will suffer under pressure and stress. Hermione takes so many subjects in her third year she becomes stressed, irritated, snappy and upset due to the immense pressure of stress due to her school work. Don't take more than you can handle.

, You can achieve this by doing your homework, studying for tests weeks in advance, doing extra credit, and finishing projects on time. Hermione studies whenever she gets the chance. When a teacher asks a question, stick your hand up as far as it will go (even if it means standing up) and try to get called on. Just remember not be too annoying, otherwise you could be sent out of class, get detention or even worse a bad mark on your report card. Doing this at every question will show your teacher that you are paying attention and are getting good grades. You want your teacher to say, ""anyone else besides (your name)?"" Hermione would be delighted that the teacher would say that.

, As Hermione once said, extra credit is always nice to have just in case, it shows your immersion in the subject and as an individual you reap the benefits of knowledge and effort. If you finish your schoolwork earlier then everyone else, start on your homework. If you ever feel like you didn't get enough homework, go up to your teacher and ask for extra work. If she doesn't have any, ask her if she can start early on a new project. Your teacher will be shocked.

, Shush them real big and keep your eyes on the teacher. Turn a little so you're not facing them. After class, go up to them and say in a rushed voice, ""It's not worth getting in trouble during an important lesson to talk about video games!"" and prance away.

Name your Pygmy Puff.,
Feed the Pygmy Puff.,
Play with the Pygmy Puff.,
Find a medium sized cardboard box, a blanket, and a marker.,Write the Puff's name on the box

,
Fold up the blanket so that if fits inside the box.,
Place the blanket in box.,
Decorate the bed box however you and your pet want it to look.

,
Tuck the Pygmy Puff in each night.",How to Care for a Pygmy Puff," You might try to look at lists of baby names online. Another suggestion is to name is after your favorite fictional character. Maybe try a name starting with A to carry on the tradition from Arnold, Ginny's puff.

, Pygmy Puffs, like Puffskeins, will eat almost anything. So do not let your pet go anywhere near your wand... or your phone. Maybe just some crackers and water.

, You might not want your Pygmy Puff to feel alone and abandoned because it will probably eat your things. You should spend time playing with your Pygmy Puff. They are nearly indestructible so you don't have to be as careful with it as you would another animal such as a rat or an owl.

, A shoebox is an ideal box.;
,, If you don't have a small blanket, use a piece of fleece fabric cut into a rectangle or square shape.

, Make sure it's nice and soft.

,, Every night read your Puff a story. Make sure you don't read violent stories, otherwise your puff might have nightmares.

Think logically and with reason.,
Be a know-it-all.,
Stand up for everything and anything you believe in.,
Be ambitious...to a healthy extent.,
Be disciplined.",How to Be Like Hermione Granger from Harry Potter2," Hermione has a scientific mind. She thinks logically rather than simply through magic which is important in deducing problems. She never accepts things without solid fact or evidence which is why she has difficulty engaging in divination.

, If people say things with incorrect grammar or have gotten an answer wrong, always correct them. You can do this nicely by saying, ""(Their name), Albert Einstein didn't create the light bulb, Thomas Edison did, just thought I would like to correct your resources so you don't get confused."" Don't overdo it though, people may start to think you're annoying. If you see something misspelled or incorrect on a test or in a book, go tell your teacher. If your teacher said something wrong, go up to her\him and tell them what they said wrong. Always give them more information on that subject, and speak in a strong voice that shows you know it by heart. Always start this by saying 'did you know'. Your teachers will be impressed. Hermione is always happy to punch mean students, too. If somebody is mean to you, pretend to punch them in your imagination. Keep in mind, if you really punch somebody, you could get in BIG trouble.

, If you think the school lunches are detrimental to the student body's health, speak out about it and try to incorporate fresher, greener foods into the mix. You can do this by going in the lunch line and saying, ""You know, I would like to have a word with you after lunch, if you you have the time"" and see what they say. Or if you are interested in helping with genocide, start a club. Hermione started S. P. E. W. to promote elf rights. Don't be afraid to speak up. Always think of someway you can make your school or a place a better place.

, Hermione's academic record does have benefits. She is able to score a top position in the ministry of magic, doing something she likes and that she is respected for. She also does something that benefits the lives of others. A good education has positive impacts for others.

, Without discipline Hermione would not be able to completed work, stay focused and take notes in class. Discipline is the key to learning.

Wear minimal (or no) makeup.,
Wear comfortable clothes that also look neat and presentable.,
Don't really worry about your hair or clothes.",How to Be Like Hermione Granger from Harry Potter3," Hermione doesn't wear that much makeup She might wear a little blush and a skin-color eyeshadow, but nothing too fancy. For movies, Hermione likely wears makeup. If Hermione was a real live human being, she probably wouldn't wear any makeup. You can wear a little makeup or no makeup at all.

, In the Deathly Hallows, Hermione was wearing a white collared shirt under a striped blue and black long sleeve shirt. On top she wore a navy blue sweater with it unbuttoned at the top. This type of clothing shows you know the rules and dress code.

, Don't dress inappropriately, if you wear crop tops, too much makeup and very low-cut dresses you will not be taken as seriously as someone dressed in a more toned-down fashion. People may consider you superficial. To avoid this, dress casually and neatly. Have good hygiene and you should at least look presentable. Hermione cares more about her brains than her looks. This was something she declared once. Hermione was described as a girl with lots of bushy brown hair. Try this: don't dry your hair after a shower; instead, let it air dry. This will leave it flowy and bouncy. If you have thick hair, try to be careful with this step.

"
"
Be kind to everyone, no matter their social status, clothing preference, or looks.,
Don't let bullies bully you.,
Never let your friends down.,
Act maturely and sophisticated.",How to Be Like Hermione Granger from Harry Potter4," Hang out with boys as well as girls and try to make friends. In the Sorcerers Stone, she met Ron with a simple ""And, you are?"" (Ron introduces himself) ""pleasure."" Watch the video at the bottom to see. If you want new students to know you are smart and quirky, then go up to them after class and with a smile and say, ""Hello, (their name), I'm (your first and last name), and I'm here if you need any help with work. I can help you choose the right path to go for learning the work of the world."" and hold out your hand to shake theirs. That student can count on you.

, Just stick your chin up in the air, stand straight, and walk away like nothing happened. Hermione would ignore them. To really annoy them if they do this to you often, say, ""You used improper grammar when you said shoes, and your posture could go with a little, say, yoga. I can help you there."" Walk away a little, ""And, you have something on your nose, just to inform you so you don't go walking around like a fool. Good day,"" and walk off. Let them try to figure out what you said, as this will likely confuse and surprise them.

, Always stick up for them and help them with their work. Never just give them the answers though, Hermione would never do that! Help them like a teacher would, and after, even if the student didn't say thank you, say (in a loud and harsh voice) ""You're welcome!"" and smile just a little to show that you're joking. They will get the idea.

, Speak maturely and sophisticated and also education. Try to get rid of ""like"" and other colloquial terms and expand your vocabulary to sound more educated and informed. Don't swear! Hermione is not the type to use profanity, unless of course there is a good reason. But Hermione usually is polite, and will not resort to swearing if she meets a problem. She thinks through problems calm and calculated. Swearing makes you sound uneducated, and if you do it often, you seem immature.

Curl your hair so that it looks ""bushy,"" as Hermione's hair is often described.,
Mimic her wardrobe.,
Wear minimal and very natural makeup.,
Carry a few books you are reading (or just haven't returned to the library yet) with you in a tan, satchel-style bag.,
Obtain some sort of wand.,
Consider adopting a cat.,
Accessorize!,
Always be hygienic.",How to Look Like Hermione Granger," In the movies, Hermione's hair varies from wavy to crimped, but it is genuinely curly and bushy in the books. Any naturally curly hair will work, whether your natural hair is wavy, spiral curls, big curls. It will all be fine. Stay natural! If your hair isn't already curly and you don't like the idea of using hot irons, then try these methods:


After you shower, leave your hair slightly wet and part it into a few sections. Twist each section up into a little bun and sleep on it. You should wake up with some nice waves in your hair.






Split your wet hair into a few sections (with more sections for thicker hair) and braid it. You could either sleep with the braids in your hair or keep them in for a half-day. You will end up with nice waves.






Curlers can also give you nice Hermione hair.






You can also dye your hair a shade of medium brown and wear brown contact lenses if your eyes are not already dark.






As a last resort, in the last film Hermione has her hair plaited so just a single braid down your back will work.





;
, Fashion is not something that Hermione worries about - she's more about books than looks. However, that doesn’t mean she lets herself look disheveled. Just remember to keep things tidy, simple and modest.



School uniform: This consists of a V-neck sweater, a white collared shirt with the Gryffindor tie, a pleated skirt, stockings or tights, Mary Jane shoes, a black cloak, and a wizard robe. (The first- and second-year uniforms are grey; thereafter, they are black). You may want to add a Gryffindor beanie and scarf in the house colors (gold and red), which you can knit yourself. Perhaps you could add a Prefect badge.

Casual dress: Because Hogwarts is rather chilly, Hermione opts for warm clothing when she dresses like a Muggle. This includes thick coats, jackets, striped or patterned knits, jeans, cords, cargo or chino pants, and a good pair of sneakers. You can also imitate Emma Watson's wardrobe from the movies by wearing sweaters, hoodies, and chinos that have a cute and classic flair.

Formal dress: For dressy occasions, Hermione straightens her hair and curls the ends. Make sure your hair has lots of volume. (This will have the same effect as the Sleekeazy's Hair Potion that Hermione uses.) She also wears an elaborate dresses for special events. In Hermione's fourth year, she attended the Yule Ball wearing a periwinkle blue dress; in the film, the dress is dusty pink. In the Deathly Hallows book, she wears a light purple dress to Bill and Fleur’s wedding; in the film, she wears a red dress.

Pajamas: Wear either a long nightgown with a light-colored dressing gown and a pair of slippers, or a plain tank top and pants with slippers and a dressing gown.

, Hermione does not care a dreadful lot about her appearance, so remember that it's your personality that counts - no matter what you wear or how you look. However, a light foundation, lip balm, natural-colored eye shadow and mascara can make your features stand out without looking too harsh. Hermione also has nicely shaped brows; you can use an eyebrow grooming brush and hold gel for this look.

, You could even include Quidditch Through the Ages, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, or The Tales of Beedle the Bard, which have been published (or you could just make fake covers).

, Hermione's wand (before it was stolen) was made of vine wood and dragon heart-string, and was fairly dark. You can use a twig for a wand, make one out of clay, paint a pencil or use whatever you like.

, Preferably one that is large, long-haired, and has a squashed-looking face so that it resembles Hermione's cat, Crookshanks. Crookshanks is a ginger Persian, but those cats can be expensive. You could also carry around a stuffed cat that has the same appearance.

, You might wear a SPEW pin, a lumpy, wool ""house-elf"" hat, or a golden chain with a small hourglass charm (to represent the Time-Turner).

, Hermione is always hygienic.

Watch and make notes on Alan Rickman in the Harry Potter movies.,
Grow your hair to your shoulders and dye it jet-black.,
Go for a pale, almost sickly complexion.,
Work on your glare.,
When talking to others, draw yourself to your full height and loom over them like a ""giant, overgrown bat"".

,
Wear long black robes all the time.,
Tattoo the ""Dark Mark"" on your left forearm.,
Talk in a low voice; it must be silky and smooth, but not whisper-like.,
Be formal: Snape's formality and dignity are imperturbable, his sarcasm is always from a superior, critical position.,
If you do talk, however, keep it to non-personal subjects and never get emotional.",How to Dress Like Severus Snape from Harry Potter," How does he dress and act? How does he move around, what is his posture like? How does his voice sound like? Practice his movements and perfect them everyday. Also look in the books for additional information on this.;
, Don't wash your hair for long periods of time- that makes it greasy. Make sure it looks lanky, straight and not curly. If you don't want to do this you could always wear a wig.

, Spend most of your time indoors;somewhere cold, dark and gloomy is especially good. avoid the sun as much as possible and do not get a tan, no matter what. Snape is known for looking sickly and sallow.

, Snape has ""cold, black eyes"", so wear black contacts if you don't have dark eyes, and tilt your head forwards as you tense the muscles around your eyes and eyebrows. Do not smile anytime, whatsoever, try out a menacing smirk instead.

,, Do not forget the ""billowing black cloak""! This is essential and Snape's trademark. No matter what, do not wear colours. Snape is very moody, any other colour except black would make him too cheery and happy.

, If you can't get a real one, get a temporary tattoo or draw it on with ink.

, Practise this everyday before you try it out in public. Make comments that are brief, direct and sarcastic. Do not say anything too long, spontaneous or has positive connotations. It is best to remain silent most of the time. Keep your diction formal and practice a southern English accent with slight upper class overtones. Do not let it lapse into Cockney or Northern English (Beatles etc.), remain upper class and formal. Sound slightly posh, and don't forget to add slight pauses between your words when you want to get your point across. Don't forget to properly pronounce your T's.

, Even with superiors, dignity and formality are his way of facing criticism. When addressing inferiors including students, use salutation and last name. ""Mr. Potter, are you quite finished?"" ""Miss Granger, your assistance was expressly forbidden."" Take points from anyone not Slytherin for anything, including breathing offensively. It's all right to parody Snape! Judge non-HP characters at the party by what House they would be in if they were in Hogwarts. Magical creatures and monsters are your social inferiors. Evil Overlords are potential allies.

, Avoid anything sentimental.

Put on black trousers and a white shirt.,

Hide long hair under a hat.,
Make a pair of ""broken"" glasses.,
Make a red and gold scarf.,
Make a red and gold tie.,
Draw the lightning bolt scar.,
Turn a stick into a wand.,
Carry a stuffed white owl.,
Make a quill.,
Get a broom.",How to Dress Like Harry Potter," If you can, use slacks and a collared, button-up shirt. The Hogwarts dress code requires everyone to look smashing.


Wear a burgundy cardigan (red sweater) in cold weather.;
, Harry Potter doesn't wear this all the time in the films, but it's required for all Hogwarts students in the books. Besides, a shirt and trousers aren't too wizardly by themselves. There are several ways to track one of these down:

, Ask whether they have old ones they will sell cheaply for costume purposes.

Thrift stores, charity stores, and costume shops might stock these.
If you know any professors, judges, or lawyers, ask to borrow their robes. (Note – lawyers in the United States don't wear robes.)
Wear a long, black coat back-to-front, or a long black skirt over your shoulders.

, A pointy black hat isn't necessary for Harry Potter, but it is easily recognized as a wizarding hat. The main use for a hat like this is to hide long hair, if you have it.

, Find a pair of round glasses with black frames at a used clothing store or drugstore. Put a piece of clear sellotape (scotch tape) over the middle of the glasses, like Harry does when his glasses break.


Toy stores sell fake glasses along with a nose and mustache. Cut off the extra bits, and they're the perfect shape.If you have your own glasses, you can make the rims black with puffy paint. For a quicker costume, cut out empty circles from black construction paper and tape them over the rims.

, If you're lucky, you can find a scarf with red and gold stripes at a clothing store, or have someone knit or sew it for you. Otherwise, you'll need to start with a plain red scarf. There are a couple ways you can add the golden or yellow stripes:


Wrap a yellow ribbon around the scarf in a spiral. Staple or sew it in place.
Cut yellow felt or construction paper into rectangles. Lay these out on the scarf. Staple or sew them on.

Paint the fabric with fabric paint.

, Find a red tie from a thrift shop – you probably don't want to paint on your own or your family's. You can make this the same way you did the scarf, but fabric paint will look best.


In the films, the Gryffindor ties are red with diagonal gold stripes. Draw a thin gold line. Skip 3 cm (1.2 in), then draw two thick lines with a thin gap in between. Skip another 3 cm (1.2 in), and repeat with a new thin line.

, Draw the famous lightning bolt running down your forehead. Use red lip liner, lipstick, or a nontoxic, washable marker.


The scar is sometimes shown and described as running down the middle of his forehead, or running down the right side., Find a strong stick from any tree, about 11 inches (28 cm) long.Decorate it however you like with paint, or make spiral patterns with puffy paint or a hot glue gun. Harry Potter's wand looks pretty simple in the films, but your version doesn't have to be.


You can use a thick wooden dowel from a hardware shop instead.
For a quick and easy wand, tape together a few pencils, twigs, or chopsticks. Tape brown or black construction paper over them.

, Carry around your own Hedwig perched on your arm or shoulder. (Tie her on with a bit of string if you need to.) Look in the toy section of department or charity stores.

, Any feather with a stiff base can be made into a quill. For an easier version, tape a feather from a craft shop onto a pen or pencil. Craft shops might also have fake parchment or scrolls to write on with your quill.

, Harry the Quidditch player has to have a broom to fly around on. Choose a wooden one with real bristles for the best look.


To complete the look, carry the Golden Snitch as well. Paint a table tennis ball gold and glue on wings from yellow construction paper.
Try convincing your friends to play Quidditch with you.

Select your house.,
Obtain the ordinary clothing.,
Obtain the robe.,
Obtain the accessories.",How to Dress Like a Hogwarts Student," Choose one whose traits you admire, or take an online quiz. Every single student has a house that they belong to at Hogwarts, so make sure you choose a house first thing. Each house has its own house colors, which affect the colors of the uniforms. Gryffindor's colors are red and gold, Slytherin's are green and silver, and Hufflepuff's are black and yellow. Ravenclaw's colors differ between the book and the movie – In the book, they're blue and bronze, but in the movie they're blue and silver. Although it may be tempting, trying not to pick a house based only on the color scheme – Other Harry Potter fans may judge your character based on your choice of house. (This is assuming you want a house-specific uniform, anyway – In the books, students don't actually have different uniforms. They all wear plain black robes, and wearing clothing underneath seems to be optional. If you go this route, you'll really only need to find a robe and a hat, but it'll be harder to tell you're from Hogwarts.);
, The Hogwarts uniform has many separate components, so pretty much all of the small details are optional because it would hardly be noticeable if they were missing. Be as thorough as you want to be with this. (If you have difficulties finding some of these items in stores, remember that Google is your friend.) The items you can find in an average clothing store are:


A plain white button-up shirt
A dark gray knitted v-neck sweater, a cardigan or a sleeveless sweater vest (with optional house color detailing on the cuffs and the waist, as seen in the picture)
Dark gray trousers, or a skirt around knee-length
Black tights or stockings (with skirt)
Black shoes
Dark gray socks

, The easiest way for you to find a Hogwarts robe is to search online. If you want a serious heavy duty one it can get pretty expensive, but you can get a lower quality one for under 25 dollars. If you'd rather it look more professional than a Halloween costume, but you don't want to spend a hundred dollars on it, it may be better for you to simply buy a black robe that's unrelated to Harry Potter and alter it by sewing. It's possible to buy house patches to sew onto robes, too. (You could also attempt make your own entirely from scratch if you have a good amount of sewing ability and patience.)

, Now that you've got the main parts of the costume, it's time to accessorize. (Once again, you're probably going to need to use a search engine.)


The first thing you need is your house tie. You may purchase a house tie (striped red and gold, green and silver, yellow and black or blue and bronze/silver, according to whichever house you're in) for a large variety of prices ranging from $7 to $130. Use your best judgment, see what other people think of the same product, and please don't use all your money on a tie. Remember that only the part near your neck will really be visible anyway since it'll be under your vest.
The second accessory you'll need is your pointed black hat. Luckily the hats aren't specifically colored, and it's very easy to find an inexpensive black witch hat in stores around Halloween, or online at other times of the year.
The third is your wand. Now, of course the wand isn't going to do much magic, but it can LOOK like it would! There are two ways to obtain a wand. Option one is to purchase a wand, and option two is to Make a Harry Potter Wand yourself. The second option is more work, but it's also more fun (and less expensive).

Act formidable and cold.,
Always appear to be silent.",How to Be Like Severus Snape," Never raise your voice on most occasions. Even while angry, Severus remains calm and cold, so if you're put into a situation where you feel like shouting, do the opposite, answer calmly, but coolly instead.;
, It helps if you try not showing your teeth at all. Severus had mastered the art of speaking without opening his mouth much, so it will help the over all effect if you practice it too. Try doing it in front of a mirror, until you get it right.

, If you have a habit of talking really fast, this may be hard, but with time and patience, you can learn anything.

, Show it in your actions, words. Just try to be actually better than others, in at least one thing. Severus things is potions, but since that's hardly going to impress any muggles, how about you try the thing that's closest to potions by becoming brilliant at science?

, Snape has a cold, calculating way of speaking to others, and most of his conversations are based on sarcasm.

, Listen carefully before speaking. Think before you say something, always choose the best response. Severus never wastes words, and when he speaks, he usually has a very good reason to do so.

, Severus Snape, is very good at hiding personal things, such as he was a Death Eater and other facts like that. Be extremely secretive, don't even tell anybody what your favorite food is.

, Do things in such a way that it makes others curious to find out what you're doing, and when they try to do so, regard them coolly and avoid further interactions.

, That is Severus specialty, and it is a useful skill to have. So next time when someone asks you what are you doing, ask them the same thing without offering an answer.

, Severus Snape hardly hugs anybody, or even waves. When meeting someone new that your respect, merely offer a hand shake. If you consider that person to be less than you, regard them coolly.

, You do not want people to know what you are thinking. This may be hard to do when you're feeling emotional, but give it a shot. Practice your poker face in front of a mirror, until you get it just right.


Smiling or laughing is not acceptable. Not even a sarcastic smile can be traced on your face. If you really want to be like Severus Snape, lose your happy face and replace it with a rather glum one.
Do not express joy or sorrow with your expressions or face. You need to make sure that people do not have a clue about what's going on in that mind of yours. If you feel the need to cry, and you can't control it, excuse yourself and go to a place where nobody can see you, and then you can cry to your heart's content. Just make sure you really are alone.

, Do things that people wouldn't expect.

, If someone is rude to you, don't get angry, just calmly talk back to them.

,, Severus has an extremely intimidating glare, and if you could master it, you would be able to scare a lot of people.

, Make little kids get out of your way and those older than you to keep their distance.

, Straight back, keep your head up, you want to let them know that you're not afraid of anything.

, This means not smiling much. Try to perfect a glare.

, Practice walking quietly and popping up in places where people least expect you to.

Ginny was considered to be very attractive as she became a teenager, but didn't cake on make up and use endless products on her hair.,
She was known as a forceful, independent young woman who knew her own mind.,
She was also very brave, tough, and thick skinned.,
Just because you're a forceful, brave girl doesn't mean you're a moody brute.,
Ginny was also an accomplished flier.,
Okay, I'm not one for promoting her bad side, but let's face it, Ginny was a very good liar.,
Ginny was an animal lover too.,
Ginny wasn't a complete bookworm like Hermione, but she was a good student.",How to Be Like Ginny Weasley," You have to make the most of what you've got, but naturally. Glow from within. For example: If you have got curly hair, don't straighten it just to look like Ginny. That isn't the kind of thing she would do.;
, Which basically means, don't let anyone tell you who you are or what to do (the latter has the exception of parents of course, this is reality). Know who you are, what you think and don't let anyone decide that for you.

, You can't let little things get to you, or scare you. It just stops you from doing the things you want to do. Stand up for what you believe in, take risks and don't forget, bravery doesn't mean never being scared, it means overcoming the things that scare you. Eventually, through doing this, you'll become nearly fearless.

, Ginny also had a lively, energetic personality. She was only ever otherwise around the early years of Harry Potter. She then grew more confidently, and more lively and energetic. She rarely cried, so like I said before, don't let the little things get to you; laugh!

, Obviously in our world (For us muggles who don't know a thing about magic), that means being good at sports. But she also kept it a secret from her family for years. So maybe sneak a bit of football/basketball/soccer/rugby... practice by yourself, and then wow your family when the occasion presents itself.

, She was able to lie or act herself out of many situations. Don't lie all the time, only when it's necessary to protect yourself or others. Don't look down, shake, sweat or stutter when lying. Instead of lying, you could practice being a good actress.

, If you have a pet, take good care of it, play with it. Love it.

, Study and get good grades, but don't turn out to be a know-it-all.

Next time you're out shopping, try to buy some funky and colorful clothes.,
Now onto the fun stuff!,
Sometimes CeCe's closet is made of crop tops and shorter shirts!,
Jeans, jeans, and more jeans!,
Stylish hats, suspenders, big purses...all super CeCe, but these are pretty extreme fashions that may not be so suitable for you.,
CeCe has extremely gorgeous shoes, such as black and brown leather booties with slight heels and sequined sneakers.,
Necklaces that have several layers of chains are really nice, especially the metallic kind.,
Stay comfortable when shopping for clothes and try creating your own fun, unique style instead of copying too much!

",How to Dress Like Cece Jones from Shake It Up," Don't be afraid to wear bold patterns and of course, loads of sparkly glitter! If this isn't your style, maybe you shouldn't try to dress like CeCe or just buy a couple of outfits like her.;
, You totally have to grab yourself some glittery vests, jackets, sweaters, and varsity jackets. CeCe has this one glittery vest that she wears with lots of her crop tops. (You can see it in the episode 'Auction It Up'. She also has some other thin sparkly jackets that she wears (Unzipped of course! Why cover the glamour?) with other fancy shirts. She also wears a white blazer over her crop tops sometimes. White can really pull an outfit together, and CeCe Jones is living proof of it.

, Paired with a bold colored tank top underneath,these shirts are fanta-bulous! If you were shopping for CeCe wardrobe, definitely pick up a good supply of tanks and crops, but that would be too monotonous. You should also buy bold and colorful off the shoulders, synthetic fashionable tops, and other funky styles! However, if you're going to do CeCe, stay away from florals and soft colors. That ""would"" be going more to the Rocky side. However, I did mention in Step One that you should add your own touch to your outfits, so if florals work, you work it, girlfriend!

, CeCe loves to wears lots of cute jeans. All of them are skinny jeans, and she is definitely not afraid to go bold. Hey, normal is boring. Let's talk regular jeans, first, meaning that they extend to the bottom of your leg. (Buying too many of these pants can get a little expensive, so find sales as often as you can and don't buy too many jeans or anything you won't really wear.) She has a few that are classic blue denim, but also lots of colorful pants! Dark and bold blue, red, white, and even animal patterns! I've found that the store Forever 21 has a beautiful and reasonably priced selection of these, so check them out!


CeCe sometimes wears short shorts with leggings underneath, or bermudas (shorts that hug your thigh and extend till your knee). Both of these she has in denim, and she has only one of each. Great for your wallet, right? (In the special 'Made in Japan' episode, CeCe wore gold short shorts with black synthetic leggings underneath, FYI). When wearing shorts, it's always a good idea to wear long socks and boots or booties. It's a pretty style that definitely doesn't let your outfit look plain.

, Wear what looks good on you, and only use this article as a guideline to develop your own rocker style.

, If you're wearing a CeCe outfit, stay away from cute flats or sandals or anything too girly. Just rock and roll, baby.

, H&M, Claires and Forever 21 have lots of selections. Plus, these don't only go on CeCe outfits; you can find lots of other clothes to pair these pretty necklaces up with, no matter if they're girly, punk, preppy, or rocker. Bangles are great, but not too many. Maybe just one or two at a time, and definitely metallic.

Try wearing a sleeveless vest with a tank top.,
Wear patterned tunics.,
Buy some patterned shirts, tank tops, and blouses.,
Buy some shirts with lace features.,
Wear some striped shirts.,
Be creative.",How to Dress Like Alex Russo in Season 41," In the picture to the right, Alex Russo is wearing a striped tank under a vest. Wearing a striped tank (any solid color would work) under a solid colored vest would be good. A long, draped vest would be best.;
, In the Season 4 Wizards of Waverly Place episode ""Alex Tells the World"", Alex is wearing a taupe-colored, ruffled, patterned tunic that has a purple diamond pattern with a black neckline. Of course, you don't need the exact top, but something similar would be good.

,


In Season 4, Alex loved wearing floral blouses, for example, in the episode ""Alex Gives Up"", she wears a black blouse with a purple and white floral pattern. In ""Journey To The Center Of Mason"", Alex wears a short sleeved patterned blouse. The blouse is lavender, dark purple, and red with a wide black belt at the waist with a rose on the right. The hem is dark purple and wavy. The blouse is short so you can see a bit of Alex's white tank top underneath.
Another top Alex wears in ""Journey To The Center Of Mason"" is a grey and white floral tee. The sleeves, neckline, sides and back are light grey while the front of the tee is white with purple and dark blue florals. The bottom is sparkly silver. You could also add a little something extra to your outfit by wearing a patterned short sleeved shirt under a tank top. In ""Lucky Charmed"", Alex wears an almost see-through v-neck lavender short-sleeved shirt with light yellow oval patterns and a dark blue floral pattern on the neckline. Alex is wearing the shirt over a white solid tank top.
Get some patterned tank tops. Another top in ""Lucky Charmed"" is a white tank top with thin straps, a ruffled neckline, and a red and brown circular pattern.

Style your hair.,
Do your makeup.,
Get the figure.,
Be confident.,
Remember to remain mysterious.,
Mimic Effy's style.",How to Dress and Look Like Effy Stonem," Effy has medium-long brown hair. She usually wears it down in loose, messy waves or curls, although she occasionally has it straightened. You can use straighteners if you prefer that style, or if you want her more trademark look, scrunch your hair when its damp with a little mousse to make it look effortlessly wavy. Alternatively, use curling tongs then run your fingers through to break up the curls and make them more loose. Either way, Effy's hair is generally shiny and glossy so use a shine-enhancing shampoo and conditioner, and a little serum to finish. You can put your bangs up if you want. Always make sure that your hair is full, voluminous, and natural looking.;
, Effy basically has three makeup styles. Barely there, light dark, and super smokey eye.



Barely there: Apply a light foundation that matches your skin tone. Apply a light pink blush on your cheeks and up your cheek bones. Apply black mascara on the top lashes. Pat a bit of white eyeshadow on your top lid and right under your bottom lid.

Light dark: Apply black eyeliner to your bottom lid. Apply a grey shadow from the middle to the outer corner of your eye. Apply black eye shadow on the very end of your outer lid and smudge it into your crease. Apply a light pink blush to the apples of your cheeks. Apply a light pink lipstick on your lips.

Super smokey eye: Apply black eyeliner to your top and bottom lid and meet them at the corners. Apply black eyeshadow to your top lid, fading as it reaches your brow bone. Apply a little black eye shadow under your eyeliner on your bottom lid. Smudge them together a bit. Apply black mascara to your top and bottom lashes. Leave your lips bare, or apply a chap stick or clear gloss.

, Effy is very slim. Bear in mind that the actress who plays her is a model in real-life. If you're already skinny, fine. If you want to get a bit thinner, exercise and eat healthily, but generally it's good to appreciate your curves the way they are and don't try to get as thin as Effy because it could be dangerous. Just be fit and healthy and you'll look as sexy as Effy instantly.

, Technically nothing to do with appearance, but if you feel confident and gorgeous that will come across. Walk tall, smile, be proud of yourself and know you look good, and your attractiveness will boost massively.

, Talk less but make your words powerful and meaningful. Effy's lines always have an underlying meaning to them.


Keep in that mind that Effy has some emotional issues that trigger her quiet yet erratic behavior. Her depression shows later on in the show, but know that she is in fact depressed. She doesn't really care about anything and what happens.

, Effy has a very edgy, grunge, semi-goth, rocker-chick style. She wears a lot of dark colors, very short dresses, quirky T-Shirts, leather jackets and miniskirts. Watch the show for inspiration. Anything short/grey or black/alternative should be perfect. However in series 4 she does begin to inject a little more colour into her wardrobe so don't be scared to throw in a bit of colour if that's more your thing. Raid Topshop, it's a very Effy shop, and search around vintage shops for unique pieces. Effy rarely, if ever, wears skirts or dresses below the knee. Keep skirts and dresses above the knee. Effy likes wearing quirky t-shirts, loose fitting tanks, shirts, and dresses, ripped skinny jeans and leggings, leather jackets, and oversized sweaters.


Accessories are important. Chunky necklaces, pearls, long dangly pendants, bangles, earrings - anything goes really. Socks, shoes, boots, belts and bags also complete the look, just have a look around and see what catches your eye. Again, think dark colors, indie style, alternative, bold prints.

Think about your personality.,

,
Match elements of your personality to clothing.,
If you'd like, find a character's style to emulate (but not completely copy!,
If you're a girl, try to do your hair and make-up like the characters.",How to Dress Like a Character off Skins," Skins characters are always dressed with their personalities in mind, so think of what kind of person you are. Are you sweet and childish, or are you more grungy and dark? Perhaps you're outgoing or maybe you're shy? All of these things, and more, can contribute to your outfits.;
,, If you're very scatter-brained, you might want to add a lot of clashing colours, such as a polka-dot dress with floral tights, whereas if you're angsty or dark, you might want to wear a lot more dark clothing like t-shirts with wolves on it or fishnet tights.

,
Unwanted hair: tweeze eyebrows, shave arms/legs, shave armpits etc.,
Weight.,
Smell good.",How to Behave and Look Like Serena Vanderwoodsen," Be charming. Serena is easy and pleasant to talk to. She doesn't make people afraid of her, instead she is very welcoming (unless she has a reason to be mad at you or hate you.) Try to model after her.;
, Love yourself. Tell yourself that you're pretty, funny, smart, everyone loves you, etc. and believe it. Don't go around telling people that you are great, or you will come off as conceited. Instead, act very modest and don't talk about yourself, but secretly know/believe that you are awesome.

, If you already have the traits above, then it should be easy for people to like you. Talk to lots of different people. Don't ignore someone because they're not ""cool"" that's not a very Serena-like thing to do. Talk to all kinds of people, you'll make lots of friends this way. However, don't try to make friends with people. If it happens it happens. Don't randomly walk up to someone and start talking, make it seem more natural. Ex. If you are working with someone you rarely speak to in science, then strike up a conversation.

, Have a certain air of mystery around you. Even Serena's scent is mysterious.

, She is also not fake, so if you don't have some or any of these things don't get them. Just make sure you look great with what you have. Serena looks like a goddess, because she knows what looks good, what looks tacky, and most importantly what looks best on her.

,, Make sure to get rid of all unwanted hair.

, It may have been said that Serena has a ""hot body"", and a lithe, long figure. Some easy tips on weight loss coming up. Eating tons of fruit, can help (make sure it's fresh fruit). Exercise, no kidding. Eat foods you like, but make sure you eat very slowly. This means you can eat whenever you have a craving, but eat it very, very slowly. Wait at least 30 seconds (estimated) between each bite, chew slowly and take smaller bites. Drink LOTS of water, this can help you lose water weight, you'll see results very soon, and don't worry about going to the bathroom all the time, it'll go away by a few days. Wear a good padded bra as well if you feel your boobs are too small.

, This goes along with hygiene. Wear deodorant..DON'T FORGET--SUPER IMPORTANT. Take a shower every day. Don't wear the same clothes twice in a week, (wash every week). Brush teeth. And to top it all off, spray a little light perfume on (too much can be gross).

Have fun with it.",How to Create Your Own Naruto Character," Including how they look, act, BF, BFF, what the other characters think about them, etc.;

If you're worried about not having enough interaction with the other Naruto characters or your planned love interest, don't fret! You'll most likely be living in the same village anyway so you'll be able to see them all the time!

, How would they respond to your character? Use the answer to edit your character's profile if necessary.

, Using your OC's personality, come up with an outfit (that you can run around in, your OC's most likely a ninja, after all)!

""Shop"" in your closet.,
Be creative!,
Don't overdo the Color.,
Shop at THRIFT STORES AND VINTAGE CLOTHING STORES.,
Layer, layer, layer.,
Girly meets edgy.,
Don't be afraid to be quirky.",How to Copy Aria Montgomery's Style Without Spending Hardly Anything," So first, make sure you have the right pieces. If you don't, a substitute is pretty easy to find, such as a denim jacket if you don't have a leather one lying around. So what are some staples of Aria's style?


Black leather jacket. It's Aria's signature, plus it really provides that edge. Use a bomber, a motorcycle jacket, or something else entirely.
Feather Earrings: Aria's got a tad of boho in her style. If you don't know where to find a ""peasant blouse"" or a ""maxi skirt,"" these earrings instantly add the hippie-vibe. Plus they're stylish and super-easy to find (If you don't have pierced ears, try clip-on feathers or a feather headband).
Daytime Dresses: Aria loves her dresses! They add the girly part to her style. Aria is often seen in floral, vintage-style dresses. You can get them super-cheap at thrift stores (Aria loves them, and you will too!). But any simple dress will work. Plus, a cute dress is what every girl has in her closet!
BOOTS: In case you haven't noticed, Aria is obsessed with boots, no matter what season. Whether they be knee-high slouch boots, high-heeled ankle booties, or edgy combat boots, she is always seen with some sort of that footwear. No dainty flats for this girl! (But check out Spencer). If you don't own any, it's a good idea to save up. You don't need the most expensive sheepskin UGG boots, any are great!
Leg wear: Have you noticed Aria's leg wear? It's crazy and awesome and creative. Get tights and Leggings in bold patterns and colors. Leg Warmers work as well, and show that you're bold.
Jewelry: The more the better! Aria loves to layer, even with her jewelry. Wear a bunch of necklaces all at different lengths. Or invest in a funky ring or a set of bangles. Be creative! Vintage stores have all sorts of cool jewelry, so you can be original. Ethnic bling is also her style.
Bags and Hats: A big leather hobo bag is just Aria's style! But don't worry, you don't need it.;
, Add your own personal spin on things! Aria didn't need to raid someone's closet, she just was herself. Toss in a studded bracelet, a fedora, or a kooky belt. It'll look cool and creative. It might even make YOU a style muse.

, Aria is the most mature of the pretty little liars, so she's not really into bright colors (But check out Hanna or Emily). No, this girl tends to embrace the dark side. This doesn't mean you CAN'T wear bright colors (It's all about being yourself) but keep an eye out for clothes in black, brown, plum, and gray.

, But if you're stuck in a mall, there's a few places that might have some Aria-style clothes. Such places are Forever 21, Urban Outfitters, Free People, Anthropologie, and H&M. But also check out smaller boutiques you haven't been in. You might find cute stuff! If you can, try to stay away from the big-name stores. Shop at independent stores, boutiques, and Aria's favorite...THRIFT AND VINTAGE STORES! Also, if you're traveling, pick up a few items there. Foreign clothes are really cute!

, This is Aria's favorite, and it gives your outfits a boho vibe. Plus, layering can really alter an outfit. Let's say you have a white tank top and plain skinny jeans. Well, a grey cardigan, chunky layered necklaces, a leather bomber, a braided belt, and a knit scarf can really change it, can't it? Plus it's Aria's key fashion secret, and it always looks great.

, This looks brilliant, and you'll see Aria using it a ton. The idea is simple: mix feminine items like floral rompers or girly skirts with edgy items like a leather jacket or some punk jewelry.

, Aria was always the ""weird"" one in the group, but it also made her special. She was also brave. Be ready to mix bold colors, textures, and patterns. It will look fantastic.

On one of the episodes she said, ""If the doll is not in the right place, I have to move it over at least a centimeter to make it look right!""

, Blair always has the perfect thing to say to anyone that insults her, right away. Make sure what you say is quick, witty, and makes total sense. Here's a tip: you have to hit the opponent where it hurts the most. Find out what makes them squirm,and use that in a comeback. Don't let anyone get away with insulting you. Being quick witted and smart is always respected. If for some reason you can't think of a good comeback on the spot, stare your opponent down. Give a tiny eye roll, smirk, and look them up and down. This would make them feel insecure without you doing anything. Then you would have won the battle.

Want to achieve Zoe's look?",How to Be Like Zoe Davis from Surviving High School," An important part of emulating Zoe Davis is her positivity. She likes for herself and everyone around her to see the brighter side of things. That said, it doesn't mean you be positive about every little thing, but try getting people excited for events or situations one of your friends may be nervous about.;
, Zoe is a kind-hearted person, and that's why she gets to be so well-liked by people at Centerscore/Twin Branches. Not only that, but her kindness is said to rub off on others, making them better people. Make an influence by being a nice and caring person.

, In the episode The Last Straw (Circa late 2011), Zoe mentions that she gets all A's in school, with an exception of a B in Biology her sophomore year. If you're not an honor student, try making it your goal. Don't try to get straight A's right away, but start out slow with A's and B's.

, Zoe is pretty talented when it comes to sports, and she has been a cheerleader since her sophomore year. If cheerleading isn't your thing, that's perfectly fine! And if you're not very into sports, that's okay as well! Try joining a club that sounds interesting. For bonus points, offer to lead a group discussion, as Zoe tries out being head cheerleader for about a week.

, One of the things Zoe does a lot is bake cupcakes! Whether it's for an event or a just-because thing, there will be a fresh batch of cupcakes by her! Also, try baking cookies. If you've never baked by yourself, you might want to ask someone to help you.

, This somewhat relates to her being positive, but Zoe goes after what she wants. It's how she made the cheerleading team, got Howard as her boyfriend, and is currently trying to win Social Chair. Also, being passionate means you're dedicated!

, If you also want to look more like her, read on - but just so you know, you are beautiful the way you are. So maybe your parents won't let you dye your hair brown, no big deal! Zoe's current look is curly hair with a green headband, and a green top to match. If green isn't necessarily your favorite, try matching your headband and top from another color. If you're not into headbands, try wearing bright colors and skirts sometimes. Zoe's look basically matches her personality.

First you need to get the look.,
The clothes.,
Roxanne's hair is definitely the key to making her look like Roxanne.,
Roxanne's eyes are a deep dark brown.,
Her body is very feminine.,
She likes to hang out with her friends in and out of school.",How to Be Like Roxanne from a Goofy Movie," Roxanne is always playing a very optimistic, cute face. She is neither overly happy or sad. Also, she seems to be very thoughtful!;
, Roxanne doesn't under dress, and she doesn't overdress. Her clothes are very simple but girly, and basic colors. In the film, she is always wearing a blue-green short sleeved shirt with blue jean shorts that have a roll at the knees. On her feet are white slip ons, and she also has ball earrings.

, Her hair is big and bouffant, wavy and not curly or straight. Her bangs are cow licked, and swoop down, and one side of her hair is sometimes pulled behind her ear. If you really want the whole Roxanne look, dye your hair her color. It is a nice shade of reddish orange.

, If you want to go all the way then get brown contact lenses. Korean circle lenses would make your eyes look even bigger and more Disney like.

, She is definitely not skinny, and definitely not fat. Roxanne has curves and a round face, big hips and very nice legs. If you are not skinny then don't worry! Roxanne isn't either, and she still has a very nice body and shape for a cartoon character.

, This includes parties, school dances, concerts. Her best friend is Stacey, and if you are looking for a new best friend then make sure its someone like Stacey! Don't become friends with someone who is into drugs or alcohol.

Have a garden filled with flowers, trees(big or small), fruit, vegetables, Have a little forest in your back garden just with a bit more plant life.,
If you want to get really creative, create your own clothes with real plants sewn on.,
Wear Makeup.,
Be smart!,
Read comics with poison Ivy in them.",How to Be Like Poison Ivy," Wear a lot of green with a splash of red and wear flowery things, but keep it green and red! A flower in the hair or bracelets made of old twigs or daisies, whatever! Just keep it with nature, the colour green and red( if you want to treat yourself to a bit of bark brown go ahead!).;
, If you're ginger headed, keep it natural, which is probably best but this is for ginger headed people. If you want to dye you hair red(if your hair isn't ginger), highlight your hair with different shades of red!

, Not to the point of injuring yourself and others around you, just be very eco-friendly. recycle, plant trees and flowers and all types of plants, talk to plants(but don't be creepy), spend a lot of time at botanical gardens, join a local environmental club, make your own fruit and vegetable garden! Be as eco-friendly as possible!

, But don't be creepy or weird. Telling someone/thing something can take a lot of stress off you(this may not work for everyone). It's like telling your friend something! You don't have to do this step, or just not do it in public. If your going to be bullied/tormented over this, don't do this step!

, Learn about all types of trees, flowers, every type of plant life.

, This is not needed but if you want you can. Make your own little garden filled with fruit and vegetables. If you want, you can say ""Thank you, Mother Nature,"" or something like that every time you take/eat something from your garden example:""Thanks earth,"" ""Thanks mother nature""

, Again, this is not needed, but you can talk seductive.

, Remind them this is a game/pretend and they can't commit crime. They could just be your BFF'S and you all stand by each other yet still do your own thing.

, To add a real Poison Ivy affect, have a little chair made out of stone/wood and cover it in flowers/leaves/branches so you can't see the wood/stone(if made of stone, you don't have to cover it fully)and hide it behind other trees and bushes in your garden so the only one who can find it is you. This could be a great place to relax/read/clear your mind/etc. Try not to tell people about this special spot.

, Get a green sleeveless vest and sew on leaves and flowers on it. Get green shorts and green tights and sew leaves and flowers on your shorts too, tie flowers together and wrap them around your tights.A weird and wacky idea is to tie leaves and flowers together and wrap them around your arms. make jewellery out of twigs and flowers. Make your own natural headgear out of flowers. With shoes, either don't wear any(only if on safe, soft ground with no sharp objects) or wear sandals with flowers on them.

, If you don't want to, that's okay. But try to wear green makeup. Put green eyeshadow on, red or green mascara with little fake flowers on and a green lipstick. If you want to, put a green blusher on. Also, green nail polish would be a real plus!

, Poison Ivy was a scientist who researched in plants, this helped her in her new plant-human hybrid life

, Don't do her criminal activities though.

Wear dark clothing.",How to Be Like Batman," Batman is a super-hero, which means he fights against injustice in all its forms. He fights against evil. Batman has been known to take on gangsters, super-villains, human penguins, genetically-engineered monster alligators, evil clowns, and frozen men. Pretty much the basics. If you want to be like Batman, you've got to be good and fight for the side of justice.


You probably don't have any Two-Faces or Penguins in your neighborhood, but that doesn't mean there's no injustice in your own world. Keep a close eye out for other kids being picked on, or anything unfair. Stand up for fairness and equality.;
, Bruce Wayne became Batman because his parents were killed in a robbery attempt. His parents were good, honest, hard-working people who cared about him very much. As Batman, his job is to defend those kinds of people. If you want to be like Batman, defend the innocent.


To be like Batman, you need to have a good sense of right and wrong. Look out for examples in your own life.

, More than any other super-hero, Batman has the most cool gadgets. If you want to be like Batman, stay up to date on new technology.


Learn to use the computer and mobile phones very well. Try to understand how the Internet works and how to use new software. Get your parents permission to do these things and stay up to date.
Batman is rich, which helps in the gadget department. But you don't have to be. If you want some pretend gadgets, use an old broken calculator, old clocks, and other broken electronics that have been thrown out in place of gadgets. Take them apart and use the components for fun. Ask permission first.

, Every Batman needs a space to call their own. Batman's cave is where he hides his Bat-gear, changes into his costume, and does his Bat-research. You don't necessarily need a secret passageway to get to your Bat-cave (or a mansion to hide it under), but it's still good to have a space that's yours.


Turn your room into your Bat-cave. Keep it private. Put a sign on the door that says, ""Bat-Cave: No Penguins or Evil-Doers.""
If you don't have your own room, find a closet to play in that you can call one. Keep your costumes and your gadgets there, and disappear in when you change into your super-self.

, Batman picked the bat as his symbol because he was afraid of bats. He wanted a symbol that would strike fear into the hearts of his enemies, just as the bat struck fear into him. Even if you're not scared of bats, you need to find and face your own fears, like Batman did.


What are you afraid of? Snakes? Spiders? Heights? Think about what scares you, then find a way to face that fear, safely. Talk to your parents about it and come up with a plan.

, Sometimes, Batman has to live outside the law. He's not a policeman, but he sometimes works with the police. Sometimes, though, the police want to arrest him. However, he's always fighting for the side of good. Are you willing to do what it takes? Even if it'll get you some heat?

, Batman's voice is always very rough, as if he just drank a quart of sandpaper. It helps to give him a different voice than his secret identity, Bruce Wayne. This is an essential part of being like Batman. Keep your secret identity separate from your own.

, Batman can fight his way out of any situation. He doesn't use guns or violence, he just fights to defend himself when necessary. If you want to be like Batman, learn how to keep yourself safe if you're attacked.


Take a martial art. These are commonly offered for all ages and skill-levels, and can be a great way to get some good Bat-training. That's what Batman did.Some recommended martial arts are:
MMA
Krav Maga
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu
Muay Thai
Boxing

, In all of the 'Batman' Series of films, you can see that he is very flexible. He jumps a lot and does cart-wheels, flips, and huge leaps.


Try to stretch each day to keep your muscles loose. You'll avoid pulling muscles while you're running around, and you'll stay nice and flexible. Touch your toes, and stretch out your arms. Go slowly and hold it for 15 seconds.

, Batman's tough and strong. You can't get that way sitting in front of the TV. You might try jumping, squatting or running to get yourself in shape. Play a sport you like with your friends. Go outside as much as possible and run around in your Bat-costume. Great way to stay active.

, Another part of staying fit like Batman does is eating a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables. When you want a snack, have some nuts, an apple, or some carrots instead of fruit snacks or candy.

, Batman would look kind of silly if he walked around sloughing in his costume. Stand up, like you're proud of who you are. Stand up, like you want to make people intimidated. It'll make you look bigger, like Batman is.

, Batman's definitely tough and strong. You never see Batman doing weak and slow movements. When you decide to run, run like you invented it. No doubts. When you jump, jump like a boss. Jump like Batman.

, Batman has actually been around since 1939, and his costume has changed a lot over time. If you want to look like Batman, you can learn how to pick the right costume:


The Dark Knight version is a vigilante who lives outside the law. His costume is metal-like and hard-looking, like plastic. It'll help to have some plastic gear if you want to look like this.
The old DC version is the iconic comic-book version of Batman. This batman costume is more playful and colorful (with the bright yellow accents) and follows a more detective-style way of fighting crime.
Another version of batman is grey and black one which was introduced in 1990s and has lost the underwear on the outside after 2011. this batman has taken a more serious approach and has stood toe to toe with gods such as Superman, wonder woman and Darkseid.

, Batman costumes are pretty common and widely available at costume shops and Halloween stores. If you want to look like Batman, this is the best way to do so.


For something creative, try to build your own Batman costume out of old clothes.

, All Batmen need to have their face covered with a mask, that covers the eyes at least. This is an essential part of keeping your secret identity a secret.


If you don't have a full Batman mask, you can get a regular plastic Zorro-style mask that covers around your eyes, or use a black strip of cloth and cut eye-holes in it.

, Batman's cape is an important way of keeping his identity hidden as well. He uses it to shield his face, deflect things, and glide through the air. A good dark cape is important for a Batman costume.


Other types of costumes will often come with capes. You could borrow the cape from a vampire costume, or some other super-hero's costume.
If you don't have a wearable cape, get permission to use an old sheet or a cloth of some kind.

, Batman, like a bat, hides in darkness. To make this easier, Batman almost always wears black clothes. Make your costume out of black, dark gray, and navy clothes to keep yourself shrouded in darkness as much as possible.


The old-school Batman costume was mostly light gray, with a black cowl and cape. If you want to look like this kind of Batman, wear a set of old gray sweats, and add a Batman emblem to the front with marker.

, Think about your future and how your actions affect others.

, If you live near forests or woods, explore them.

, You need to realise that nature is a complex, living organism. To do this, you should observe it every day. Even if you live in a city, you can connect with the flora and fauna in your surroundings. People connect with their pets and plants every day without realising.

If you're a girl you can use blue eyeshadow. Use it normally on your eyelids and use it as face powder on the rest of your face. Don't use too much highlighter on your face, and make sure the final look seems ""natural,"" not painted on (this works best if you have a pale complexion). If you don't like the effect, then use the eyeshadow only on your eyelids. Also try braiding your hair in any way.






For boys and girls: if you can, dye your hair black. Wear natural-looking clothes but nothing too revealing. You don't want to get into any trouble.







, The most important thing is to remember that you are a human, and the Na'vi aren't real. The movie Avatar has many lessons, and can teach the human race many things, make sure you watch it.

Be open to different types of training.,
Vary your workouts constantly.,
Learn martial arts – the Bruce Lee way.,
Train the arms and feet.,
Strength train.,
Condition yourself.,
Focus on core training.",How to Be Like Bruce Lee1," Lee approached physical training in an open and flexible way. He embraced many different traditions, and he didn’t like training regimens that were one-size-fits all.


Instead, Lee borrowed from many disciplines, including martial arts, bodybuilding, and other types of training. He used barbells, kettle balls and circuit training regimens on different days of the week.
Lee believed in organizing workouts by similarities; he would train differently on each day. For example, some days would be devoted to punching, and some devoted to kicking.It’s said that he could hold a barbell that weighed 40 kilograms (88 pounds!) for 40 seconds at arm’s length and that he could punch his finger through a closed can of soda. He could swap a coin in your hand before you had time to close it.;
, Bruce Lee was not a person who found a single workout to stick with forever. He was constantly changing his workouts and trying new things to push his body to every limit and to prevent his body from being able to adapt.


He ran, rode bikes, and jumped rope as well as practiced kicking and punching. In other words, he was interested in all-around training.
Bruce Lee was an all-around athlete with an extremely defined body and an incredibly impressive combination of speed and strength.
Lee did enjoy martial arts, but he didn’t want his body to get too used to any fitness regimen. Check your ego at the door. The goal of Lee’s training was not to physically look great. He wanted a functional body and described training as “the art of expressing the human body.”

, Although Bruce Lee practiced many different physical fitness regimens, he is clearly defined in part by his ability to excel at martial arts. To some degree, he used other fitness styles in order to become a better martial artist.


He started learning the Wing Chun style of Kung Fu from a grandmaster and then he formed his own method, Jeet June Do, which was not bound by rigid rules.
Lee defined this as “a style without a style,” meaning the fighter was open to fight in whichever way he or she thought would be effective.
He practiced martial arts rigorously though so that he had all kicks and punches at his disposal if needed. Some martial arts studios in your area might use the Bruce Lee style of fighting.

, Lee put a lot of emphasis on training the muscles in the forearms, which he felt were extremely important for any martial artist. It was by no means the only training he focused on, but he considered it important.


Lee would hit heavy bags as aggressively as he could. He was always on the move, side-stepping and feinting, even when hitting a bag, because he believed you shouldn’t leave yourself open to attack.
He used jabs, crosses and hooks when punching. He felt the feet were also incredibly important, and that it was important to be able to move fast and lightly with them. He used side kicks, hook kicks, spin kicks, rear and front thrusts, and heel kicks when training.

, Bruce Lee knew that martial artists also needed to build their strength. He was one of the visionaries who first made this connection.


Thus, he worked on developing his arm and leg strength with weight training. He didn’t only punch and kick bags. He used weights in his workouts.
Lee would use kettle balls and barbells to do squats, pullovers, and bench presses. He is known for his extremely well defined muscles, as his body was in the best shape that is possible.
He was also known for being able to do two-finger pushups, which is where he used the thumb and index finger of one hand, with his feet a shoulder-length apart, while he performed a push up.

, In addition to strength training and martial arts, Lee was a big fan of conditioning the body. He felt that endurance training mattered too because increased stamina would make him a better fighter.


To condition his extremely finely tuned body, Lee would run. He considered this a form of meditation to bring inner peace as well as conditioning. He would typically run about 40 miles per day three times a week, changing tempo as he ran.
Lee enjoyed jumping rope because he thought it would increase his stamina as well as build the muscles in his legs. He jumped rope three times a week for about 30 minutes a day.
Lee enjoyed stationary cycling, again to focus on his stamina and his legs. He could get an exercycle up to high speeds for 45 minute at a time and would try to do this for three days a week.

, Lee felt that the abdominal muscles were really important to an elite martial artist because they enabled the martial artist to withstand even the hardest punches.


Lee’s famous six-pack abs were not about looking great. They were about creating a shield that could ward off tough punches from opponents.
In order to strengthen his abdominal muscles, Lee would have a person drop a medicine ball on his stomach, while he was lying on the ground. Be careful with this maneuver if you are not already in impeccable shape so you don’t get hurt.
Side bends, leg raises and sit ups were some of the ways that Lee worked his abs. He would usually do 5 sets to failure.

"
"
Show extreme focus.,
Study wu wei.,
Read a lot.,
Be confident.",How to Be Like Bruce Lee2," One of the most famous quotes often attributed to Bruce Lee is “absorb what is useful. Reject what is useless.” Bruce Lee was known for his extremely focused intensity.


Even if the quote wasn’t actually said by Lee (that’s debated), it captures a lot of his philosophy. He used this ability to focus to his advantage while fighting, but he employed discipline and focus through all aspects of his life.
While being focused on the task at hand, Lee was extremely open to experimentation. He was focused on achieving top physical and mental fitness, but he did so with a wide range of activities and ideas.Bruce Lee was extremely disciplined. Be unpredictable when fighting, though. Bruce Lee had a legendary style of fighting that relied on what was called “the way of the intercepting fist.” That meant that he was an unpredictable fighter who altered his strikes depending on his opponent’s incoming attack. He was entertaining because he was not predictable.

, Bruce Lee believed in internal balance. He was interested in wu wei, which is a term in Taoist philosophy that means “not doing.”The goal of wu wei is to only undertake natural action, and to, thus, allow things to come easily or naturally, rather than partaking in activities that involve struggle or extreme effort.A lot of people misunderstand wu wei. To practice it, clear your mind and get in the flow. Wu wei does not mean laziness. It means not overthinking things and making them more difficult than they need to be. Bruce Lee was known for his metaphysical wisdom.He once wrote that wu wei was “not being without emotion or feeling, but being one in whom feeling was not sticky or blocked. Therefore in order to control myself, I must first accept myself by going with and not against my nature.”

, In order to be like Bruce Lee, you should exercise the mind, not just the body. Read books about philosophy because Bruce Lee merged his philosophical beliefs with his fighting. In fact, while a student at the University of Washington, Lee studied philosophy.


Lee was an atheist who was influenced nonetheless by religious traditions like Taoism, Joddu Krishnamurti and Buddhism. Bruce Lee believed that knowledge led to self-knowledge.
He expressed himself through martial arts. He wrote poetry that spoke about the deeper and darker areas of human psyche. He was interested in human enlightenment.One of his most famous quotes is “Be formless… shapeless, like water.”Bruce Lee once wrote in admiration of water: “Water is so fine that it is impossible to grasp a handful of it; strike it, yet it does not suffer hurt; stab it, and it is not wounded; sever it, yet it is not divided.”, Bruce Lee didn't back down from what he believed in. Primarily, this was because, above all, Bruce Lee believed in himself. He had the confidence to set his own path in life.


Don't confuse that with arrogance. He had enough humility to know that he, himself, did not hold all of the answers, so he turned to many other teachers and disciplines in his quest to find them.
He mastered his own mind and body, taught himself everything he wanted to, and loved himself for it. So you need to know what you want to do in your life, start doing it now, and believe in yourself!
One way to describe Bruce Lee accurately is to say that he was a knowledge seeker. He had an unquenchable thirst for self-improvement, both physical and of the mind. Lee didn’t let oppression hold him back. He shattered cultural barriers and fought back against those who would hold him back.

"
"
Eat right.,
Devote yourself to fitness.,
Learn about Asian culture.",How to Be Like Bruce Lee3," Bruce Lee knew that total fitness excellence must also include eating right. He had a list of banned foods that he never touched, and he enjoyed protein-rich drinks. He didn’t put anything in his body that he considered empty calories.


Lee was trying to gain weight in muscle, and he went from 100 to 130 pounds. He made weight-gain shakes that mixed powdered milk with things like royal jelly, vitamins, and ginseng. Lee wouldn’t eat baked goods or things made with refined flour because he didn’t think they added anything important to the body.
Lee did not eat food he thought could harm his body. He didn’t drink coffee, choosing tea instead. He enjoyed Chinese food, though. He was not a vegetarian or vegan and enjoyed eating meat, but the Chinese dishes he ate most were vegetable heavy.In contrast to some modern diets which have turned carbohydrates into the enemy, Lee tried to eat carbs because he thought they were needed to maintain such a high level pf physical activity. Thus, he would eat them in 4-5 small meals a day. He liked Chinese food because of its emphasis on vegetables and rice versus proteins and fats.

, To really be like Bruce Lee, you have to turn fitness into a livelihood. It wasn’t something that he just did once and a while. It was a lifestyle to him. It was something he did every second of every day.


It would be difficult to be completely like Bruce Lee, in part because his level of devotion to fitness was almost unparalleled and because it takes so much time. Many people are too busy to basically make fitness their careers.
However, you could still engage in training that is inspired by his general philosophies. The key is to go for a full body workout by mixing up your routines, and to do it consistently, even if, for you, that means several days a week.
To really be like Bruce Lee though, fitness needs to permeate almost everything that you do in your life, and mental fitness should be part of it. Bruce Lee was a deep thinker. Sadly, though, all of this devotion did not provide Lee with the gift of years. He died young of a cerebral edema at age 33.

, Bruce Lee was of Chinese descent (he was born Lee Jun-fan), and Asian culture remained important to him during his entire life.


He was the son of a Cantonese opera star. Lee himself was also an actor, known for revolutionizing how Asian actors were seen on screen. He was born in Chinatown in San Francisco, in the year of the dragon.
His mother was half Chinese and half Caucasian in descent and his father was Chinese. His father introduced him to martial arts after he was involved in street fights with gang members.
Lee trained in martial arts in Hong Kong. He began teaching martial artists in the United States in 1959. Lee’s movies focused on amazing fight sequences. For some movies, he merely choreographed the fight sequences. His films turned him into a martial arts legend and helped interest young people into martial arts.

Have a couple of friends, but not too many.",How to Emulate Twilight Sparkle," Getting bangs would be a good idea too, only if they look good on you.;
, If you can't, then either buy a wig or straighten your hair to get a similar style. If you really want to get into the look, you can even add the darker purple and pink stripe she has down her mane onto your own hair!

, Twilight is a bookworm, so get only a slightly muscular shape.

, Because Twilight's main scheme is mostly lavender and royal purple, wear those colors often. In addition, go for clothing that looks professional and has the look of a classic school girl (think pleated skirts, collar blouses, vests, etc).


Dress appropriately. Try to dress smartly, and avoid shirts with the words 'LOL', or other things like that printed on them.

, Wear purple, pink and blue eye shadow, with a silver lip gloss. Make sure to keep your skin free of acne too.

, Twilight is into books, not fashion. If fashion is more your thing, look for articles on how to be like Rarity.

, It's also a good idea that when you buy them, you make sure they are either washable, or are able to be washed by a cloth.

, Try to buy your clothing in violets, lavenders, and light blues!

, Twilight Sparkle is very into books. She even lives in a library! Read and study a lot.


Read fact books, or non-fiction.

, Because Twilight Sparkle reads a lot, she is also very smart. Build up on your grammar and writing skills.


Choose something you're interested in (History, Culture, Architecture, etc...) and study it! Find out who started it/invented it, what it used to be like when it was first started/invented! Some good ideas are: Math, Physics, Chemistry, Astronomy, History, Biology and Culture.

, This is the most important step. Twilight would never get a bad grade, and always studies. So, do your best in school, and study away.

, Even if she is the princess of friendship, she's still a bit of an introvert.

Try to act like Belle.,
Embrace your natural beauty.,
Try to mimic Belle's fashion sense.,
Accessorize with style.,
Walk with elegance and grace.,
Just enjoy being a princess!",How to Be Like Belle from Beauty and the Beast,"

While it's important to just be yourself, if you are looking to really be like Belle from Beauty and the Beast, it is important to always be kind. She is never rude or mean to anyone, not even the Beast who kidnapped her and her father. Although it is important to be kind to everyone, make sure that you aren't mixing up being kind and being flirtatious. Don't flirt with everyone you see, but rather treat them like friends. This makes you a more genuine, down to earth person. Treat everyone with respect and care.
Always smile! Belle, from the beginning of the story right through to the end is always smiling and being positive, so try to smile whenever and wherever you can, and not only will you find yourself automatically feel better but people will gravitate towards your sunny, positive attitude.



 


Read a lot! Belle is always seen with a book, and her love of libraries is one of the factors that bring her and the Beast closer together. Belle is very intelligent, and this is mostly due to the large amount of books that she reads, which leaves her with a very large vocabulary and very vivid imagination.






Be respectful to your parents. Belle would do anything for her father and she knows how important it is to listen to your elders. Manners is definitely another point - make sure you are always thanking others and using please, and avoid arrogant, cocky tones. Make your voice sweet and lady like, enunciating every syllable.






Be strong and honest. She always states her opinions, never keeps them hidden, and she demands to be treated like an equal. Look people in the eye when you talk to them and that'll make for a much more engaging conversation, as they will feel that you are really listening and appreciating what they have to say.
And most importantly - don't judge someone by how they look. The primary theme of the story is not judging a book by their cover and only by what's inside. Belle didn't judge the Beast and instead became very close to him, developing a strong friendship that later turns to love. Try to go out there, meet new people and learn about themselves, their personality and characteristics, and you might find that you'll meet someone who is just like you and create a lifelong friendship.





;
,

Hair: Belle has long, luscious brown hair, which she usually ties back with a ribbon into a low ponytail. Regularly wash and condition your hair, every day if you have oily/thick hair or every other day if you have finer hair. Tie your hair back with any colour ribbon, particularly blue or yellow. She also has layers at the front section of her hair, as one of her trademark quips are short strands of hair falling from her ponytail and framing her face, which she is often seen brushing away when nervous.






Skin: Belle has smooth, clear and fair skin. Try to stay out of the sun or use a sunscreen with high sun protection, and wear a hat. She, as well as majority other Disney princesses, has incredibly flawless skin so it is important to maintain a clear complexion. Cleanse, tone and moisturize twice daily, using products suited for your skin type. If you have dry skin, moisturize more and if you have oily skin, blot your face frequently with blotting papers.






Makeup: Belle has an amazing, natural makeup look. In the film she doesn't wear any makeup, however on a day-to-day-basis her makeup is very suitable for all ages from 14+. - Skin: Apply a light foundation, tinted moisturizer or BB cream all over the face, making sure that it is blended in well. Then apply a small amount of concealer on any problematic areas, and a lighter shade just under the eyes to hide any bags or dark circles. Lightly powder the face with translucent powder if you have oily skin, or if your makeup leaves a dewy finish. Belle's skin isn't too matte and isn't too dewy, but rather the perfect balance in between. Make sure the application isn't too cakey. Then, finish off the face makeup with a dusting of peachy pink blush across the cheeks.- Eyes: Begin by grooming the eyebrows through with a spooly or eyebrow brush. Fill in your eyebrows using a shade that's 3 shades darker for light hair, and 3 shades lighter for dark hair. Set eyebrows using an eyebrow gel. Moving onto the eyes, apply a small touch of concealer to the lids just to cover any veins showing through the thin, delicate skin. You can then, optionally, add a very light matte brown shade into the crease to add some extra definition and a smudge of brown eyeliner (very light and very thin) to the upper lash line just to thicken the eyelash line. Finish off by curling your lashes slightly and applying a few light coats of brown mascara. - Lips: Belle's lips aren't too red or pink, but rather a very soft rosy shade. Apply a moisturizing lip balm that has a rosy tint to the lips. Do not apply lip gloss or lipstick as it is too harsh for Belle's soft makeup look.






Body: Belle is very lean and toned, and well in shape. Make sure that you are eating a good variety of fruits and vegetables, as well as keeping up with consistent exercise. Running, long walks, Pilates and aerobics are a good start.

, Obviously, she lived in a time where large, poofy dresses were all the rage, but she still has a very consistent, elegant style.

Don't wear clothes that are too revealing. Make sure that your chest is covered so no cleavage is showing at any time, and definitely don't wear any item of clothing that shows too much leg. Go for skirts that stop around mid-thigh to knee length, and shirts that have a sensible neckline.






Wear quite feminine clothing. Dresses and skirts are the obvious ones, however it's also acceptable to just wear jeans. It is very easy to imagine Belle in a modern-day world wearing a simple pair of blue jeans and a simple white button-up shirt. Find a nice, bright blue pair of skinny jeans (not too tight) and pair it with a long sleeve, white button-up shirt. Fold up the sleeves and bottom of the jeans for an even more effortless look. For shoes, go for a light pastel pair of moccasins (without tassels or bows), or a nice simple pair of brown worn-in boots. It's also a good idea to have one special, princess dress for you to wear on very special occasions, something elegant, sweet and age-appropriate that compliments your features and figure. Make sure that all the pieces co-ordinate, so it's not overtly frilly or poofy. Simple, basic yet elegant and sweet are key to Belle's look.






Go for light, muted, pastel colours. Blush pink, light sky blue, lilac/lavender, mint green, faded yellow, white, cream - all the colours that Belle would wear. For the days where it gets chillier, go for a coat with a deep, rich brown colour or a deep velvety red. 







,

Belle doesn't wear that many accessories, apart from the pair of gold/yellow pearl earrings she wore after going to the Beast's castle. Go for cute, simple and elegant accessories, such as pearls, lace and flowers in your hair make a very sweet touch. However, the main hair accessory you should use is a ribbon in your hair, as Belle wears that always.






Don't go for heavy, clunky metal pieces or spikes. It is too retro and punk for a simple sweet Disney princess look.







, Imagine there is a rope pulling your head up, so keep your shoulders back and walk like a swan, smoothly and gracefully. Don't slouch or saunter either., Belle is so classy, sweet and elegant, so just enjoy acting and looking as her and you'll find yourself becoming more and more like a natural princess every day."

Learn the basic requirements.,
Gain acting and performing experience.,
Consider a college degree.,
Stay in physical shape.,
Familiarize yourself with different Disney princesses.,
Get headshots.,
Prepare a resume.,
Sign up for an audition.,
Prepare for your audition.,
Attend your audition.,
Attend training.,
Follow Disney protocol.,
Understand the extent of your obligation.,
Be prepared to improvise.,
Prepare for uncomfortable situations.",How to Be a Disney Princess," If you're interested in becoming a Disney princess, there are a variety of basic requirements. Some of these requirements are based on unchangeable qualities, such as your height and age. If you wan to pursue work as a Disney princess, make sure you meet the basic qualifications.


Disney princesses need to be between 5'4 and 5'7. This is to make sure princesses resemble the characters on screen.You have to be at least 18 years old to be a Disney princess. The oldest a princess can be varies. Most Disney princesses are between 18 and 23. However, princesses who have worked successfully for Disney in the past may be between the ages of 24 and 26. It is rare to find a Disney princess older than 27.In terms of size, Disney princesses can not be higher than a dress size 10.;
, Disney has no specific requirements regarding past work when it comes to hiring princesses. However, acting and performing will be a large part of your job. Having experience in these fields can help you audition successfully.


In high school or during college, join a theater group. You might also want to take classes like drama in order to learn the craft of acting and performing. If you're not currently in school, see if there are any acting classes available in your area.
Look for performance experience. Audition for school plays or community theater. See if you can find a job that requires that you perform. For example, you could work at a restaurant, like Medieval Times, where you have to play a character as part of your job.
Learn a bit about improv. Take an improv class at your local theater or art center. Join an improv group to get hands-on experience. As you'll be answering questions in-character while working at Disney, you'll need to learn basic improvisation.

, Disney has no specific degree requirements for princesses. However, a college degree in something like theater could bolster your chances of career success.


The one downside of gaining a college degree is Disney's age requirement. Most people graduate college around the age of 22. Remember, most Disney princesses are between 18 and 23.
However, there is one upside to a college degree. Disney offers a college program where you spend a semester working at a Disney theme park. You'll get invaluable behind-the-scenes experience and have the opportunity to meet cast members. This may lead to work with the Disney corporation later on, providing you an in for a princess role., As Disney princesses cannot be higher than a size 10, work on maintaining a healthy weight. Toned muscles may give you an edge as well. The audition process is largely non-verbal, so your physical presence makes a big difference.


The Department of Health and Human Services recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of strenuous aerobic activity a week to stay fit. Moderate aerobics include things like brisk walking or light biking. Strenuous aerobics would be things like running or jogging. It's also recommended you incorporate strength training twice a week.If you're trying to lose weight, you may need to be exercising more each day. Talk to a doctor about how to lose weight as he or she will be able to give you advice that takes your current weight and medical history into account.
It's best to pick activities that you enjoy. If you loathe running, for example, don't plan on getting fit with a daily jog. Instead, try something you enjoy like swimming or biking.Strength training can come in the form of classic weight lifting. However, activities like Pilates and yoga help you build your core muscles simply by using your body as weight.
Eating a healthy diet can also help you get fit. Aim for a diet that includes a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables. You should also eat whole wheats and healthy, lean proteins like those found in poultry and fish.

, You do not get to choose which character you play as a Disney princess. If you love Belle and know every detail about her, you may end up being asked to play Mulan. Therefore, try to have some familiarity with all the Disney princesses before beginning the audition process.


There are 13 Disney characters officially recognized as princesses by the Disney franchise. They are Jasmine, Ariel, Rapunzel, Tiana, Belle, Merida, Cinderella, Pocahontas, Aurora (Sleeping Beauty), Mulan, Elsa, Anna, and Snow White.Disney does provide an extensive training process for those chosen to be princesses. It involves extensive viewing and analyzing of the films to help you better match the character's mannerisms and voice. Therefore, you do not need to memorize everything about each princess as Disney does not expect you to be an expert going in. It's still a good idea to watch all the Disney princess films prior to your audition. This will show your commitment to the Disney franchise., Headshots are an important tool when auditioning to become a Disney princess. Quality photos printed on standard, letter-sized paper are ideal. Make sure your photos accurately represent your current appearance.Choose the right outfit for headshots. Go for a solid color over something patterned, as this can be distracting on camera. Plain white, however, might produce a glaring effect. A V-neck is usually flattering. Keep the outfit somewhat professional but also fun. A tank-top or sleeveless shirt can be a nice touch. Avoid jewelry, as this can be distracting.Do your make-up how you usually wear it for an average. Take some extra time and apply carefully. Do not apply make-up heavily, as clumped mascara or smeared lipstick will show up in a headshot. Shiny eye shadow or lipstick can cause camera glare so it should be avoided.Avoid cutting or dyeing your hair before a shoot. Wear it as you usually do. Drink a lot of water in the days leading up to your headshot to help you skin look hydrated and healthy.You can pay to have professional headshots taken. This can be expensive, however, and there's no guarantee you'll like how the photos turn out. Consider asking a friend with a nice camera to help you take some flattering photos of yourself. Go to a local print shop to make copies.

, A resume highlighting your acting and performing experience can be helpful. Disney recommends keeping your resume to one page. They also mention a lack of experience is okay. Much of your training and learning will come after you've been hired.An actor's resume is slightly different from a standard resume. As with a regular resume, list any basic contact information like your name, phone number, and address.You should also list any special performing skills you have. For example, if you have professional vocal training, this is something to include.You should list any performances you've been in, and include the time, location, and the roll you played.Some actresses list their measurements, height, and weight on a resume. As Disney does have specific size requirements, this could be helpful information to include.
Bring a copy of your resume with you to your audition. Keep it in a folder so it stays in good condition.

, You can find a list of auditions on the Disney auditions website. Look for auditions for ""Female Disneyland Character Look-a-likes"" in areas near you. When you click on the link, it will outline the requirements for that role. As long as you meet these requirements, you can sign up to audition online.

, Disney princesses do not speak during auditions. You will imitate a Disney character and use gestures to communicate. The selection process is based on coordination, attitude, and movement.Work on your smile. Disney princesses have to smile frequently on the job so spend some time practicing a smile before a mirror.
It can help to record yourself moving and then study your form. You can compare your movements to a scene of the princess you're portraying.
You do not need to come in costume. Disney recommends you wear comfortable clothing to the auditions as you'll be asked to complete a specific set of movements. Choose clothes you can easily move in when planning your auditions wardrobe.Get a good night's sleep the night before your audition so you're energetic in the morning.

, When you get to the audition, there will always be a cast member present to help you check in. They will take down your name, your time of arrival, and you'll give them your headshots and resume.Time is very important to the Disney corporation. You should aim to arrive at least 15 minutes before your scheduled audition time.The audition room can be somewhat intimidating but try to stay calm when entering. A Disney director will introduce him or herself. Then, you'll be given a few instructions and asked to perform.All Disney auditions are closed. You cannot bring family members or friends into the audition room with you., If you're chosen to be a Disney princess, you'll attend a five day training process. You will be assigned a character and analyze any films involving that character. By the end of training, you should be able to successfully mimic the mannerisms, voice, and other aspects of your character., Disney has a variety of protocol princesses are expected to follow. Breaking any rules could result in your position being terminated.


You are not allowed to talk about the character you play for Disney. You cannot post anything about your character on social media. This is a very strict rule so make sure you follow it properly.When you're playing a Disney princess, you cannot reference anything outside the Disney universe. You cannot, for example, talk about a TV show on Cartoon Network while portraying Mulan., If you're chosen to be a Disney princess, it's at least a yearlong commitment. While the job may seem fun, it can get frustrating at times. In some roles, you're working outside all day and must learn to tolerate both very hot and very cold temperatures while still in costume. Make sure your committed to staying a Disney princess for at least a year before signing any contract., As a Disney princess, you'll have to be in character all day. On occasion, you may have to answer questions from fans. Make sure you are able to think of an answer off-the-cuff. For example, if you're playing Ariel a child might ask you where Flounder is. Be prepared to respond with something like, ""Flounder is hanging out with Sebastian in the ocean today."", Many former Disney princesses have admitted older men at the Disney park often hit on them. Men may ask you when you get off work, pass you phone numbers, or otherwise behave inappropriately. Inform your supervisor if anyone gets out of hand."

",How to Act Like Veruca Salt from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,";
, Never wear make-up, although if you have freckles, you might want to use some foundation to cover them up.

, Gold has a wealthy aura. Owning one decent piece is better than a box full of junk pieces. Earrings should be little gold or silver studs, or maybe precious gems. Use real pearls; these are the only acceptable sort for the wealthy look.

, Just because you got some clothes from an upper class store doesn't mean they are preppy. Buy clothes that are classic, and clean-cut. Don't be afraid to splurge on these a little, as preps tend to hold onto clothes for a long time. Remember to make sure your clothes are always clean, and always match. Good fabrics are very important. Get rid of any polyester. Buy mostly 100%cotton, wool and cashmere. Wear preppy colors. Bright and happy, like green, pink, light blue, nautical red, white and navy blue and preppy patterns such as plaid, stripes, gingham, polka dots, argyle, floral, paisley, nova checks, and tartan.


Here are some suggestions for that type of clothing:






Polo shirts






Oxford shirts (unlike polos, oxford shirts should always be long-sleeved if it is warm outside simply roll up the sleeves)






Rugby shirt






Cable-knit vests and sweaters (traditional cricket sweaters)






A jacket or blazer (navy blue is a staple; try seersucker or madras plaid in summer, tweed in winter)






Chino pants-could have cuffs






Khaki pants. The prep equivalent to jeans






Bermuda shorts (khaki, madras plaid, seersucker, linen or preppy prints and patterns)






Skirts (khaki, madras plaid, seersucker, linen, preppy prints and patterns)






Tea dresses and summer dresses (in madras plaid, preppy colors, seersucker, or linen). A-line dresses, halters, and flowy dresses are acceptable.






Tennis- and golf-inspired shirts, skirts, and dresses








Know the right stores and the right things to buy. Go to outlet malls where clothing is a bit cheaper than at the retail stores. Tommy Hilfiger, Abercrombie and Fitch, Armani Exchange and even Dolce and Gabbana clothing can be purchased for a lower price. Also, check wholesale stores that sell gently used clothing for a much cheaper price then at the actually store(check tips for a minor addition to this section).







, If you're unsure about how to put together outfits, Google ""preppy outfits"".

, Remember to always be clean: run a comb through your hair, keep your nails dirt-free and neat, brush your teeth and bathe/shower. When spraying perfume, be sure to use just enough, but not too much. Excessive use of perfume isn't attractive and does not improve your hygiene, despite popular belief. Being clean is important; being grubby isn't classy and isn't pleasing.

, It will make you look, annoying, and is sometime insulting to real Brits.

,, If you want to be like the one from ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" the 2005 film, don't worry too much about it.

, Did someone use the last napkin? Did someone forget to put the toothpaste cap back on? Remember that you're only pretending; there's no reason to flip a table over a pretend grudge

, Otherwise, your bad reputation (see warnings) may make people accuse them of being ""drunk.""

,, Always have it on you.

,, Most people will be jealous if you have money and no worries in life. Get good grades, look nice, act nice, and always enjoy yourself when you're out. Never tell people about ""bad things"" in your life, this will make people think they are better than you if they have something you don't. If someone has something you don't have or is going somewhere nice, than don't act like it is a big deal, just stay cool, make it seem like it is something normal in your life.

, Post adds on a neighborhood website offering babysitting and pet sitting. If you have a lawnmower, offer to mow peoples lawns or rake leaves. Do something to get money whether that is simply asking your granny or you having to work for it.

,, Work really hard at your schoolwork and make sure you get grades no lower than 'B+'. If you do, pout and kick up a fuss (but not to the teacher!) A 'C' is unacceptable!

, It is a must. Use big words. Rich people are often well-educated and thus have good vocabularies. Learn a new word every day like ""aberrant,"" ""culpable,"" or ""capricious."" Having a vocabulary like this increases charm and wit, which can be considered a MUST in higher circles.

, Aside from good hygiene, you have to dress classy/posh. T shirts and sweatpants will not cut it. A golf shirt and plaid shorts will work at the least, or some designer. If you cannot afford a lot of designer clothes, get some ""minor designer"" clothing. Some examples are Isaac Mizrahi, Mossimo, etc. A bit cheap sometimes, but some will work.

, Some good wardrobe basics would be a Louis Vuitton handbag, a Burberry scarf and a pair of pearls or diamonds. Also, convince your dad to dress well. Some good choices would be Lacoste/Tommy Hilfiger/Nautica polo's and 2 or 3 Pierre Cardin jackets. An Armani suit would also be good. If you can't afford all these, just convince them to look elegant.

, When friends come over, make your ordinary house look 'rich' by printing poster sized pictures of famous paintings, or you and your family dressed in beautiful clothes, or your parents' wedding and frame them. Then hang them up. On your desk keep all your things neat and tidy. Have a pink or white bedspread, and for your computer, put a cover, (pink or white), over it. The house should be tidy.

, As cliched as it sounds, learn about wines and cheeses. Learn how to pronounce words like Béchamel and Beaujolais. And learn good table manners. Otherwise you will look like a complete fool at dinnertime. Read etiquette books(American Girl is good).

, Having a coffee or tea at hand also makes you look rich.

Keep casual. You may prefer to wear a sweater - make sure it looks very homemade and lumpy. If you can, add a big ""R"" to the sweater. Also wear jeans and tennis shoes. Again, this is part of Ron's casual look.







,


Friendship is very important to Ron. Ron and Harry have been friends forever and always will be. If they fight, Ron doesn't apologize unless he really wants his friend back.

, Some examples of how Ron is include:


Have a don't care aura if something bothers you. This is really Ron-like.
Have something funny to say most of the time. If the people around you are sad or depressed, find something that amuses them. Try not to use jokes from websites. Try to make some up on your own. Some people have a natural sense of humor, which is great.
Be afraid of spiders. Ron is deadly scared of spiders. He finds them gross and scary. If spiders don't already scare you, try to be scared. Ron says spiders are ""disgusting"".
Don't be emotionally expressive. Ron doesn't let his feelings out easily. If he has a crush on someone, he just looks at her from afar and makes jokes. Ron finds jokes way more fun than flirting.

Wear black when you're serious.,
Wear sunglasses, even when inside.,
Put your hair in a ponytail.,
Work out for better cardio but don’t develop a muscular body.,
Wear boots no matter the circumstance.",How to Act Like Steven Seagal1," When you’re about to take out the bad guys or you're going to go interrogate a criminal's lackey, make sure that you are wearing black at all times. Typically a black leather coat is the best option, but if it’s hot outside you can wear a black button down shirt.


If you’re not being serious then you can wear a brightly colored Hawaiian shirt or a kimono.
Never wear shorts, instead wear dark slacks.;
, You can read someone when you can see their eyes.Instead of giving away your intentions, wear black sunglasses to obscure them from your enemies.


Be careful when walking around inside with sunglasses, you could trip into something and hurt yourself.

, Even if you don’t have enough hair to put it up into a suitable looking pony tail, you should do it anyway. Make sure to fasten it to the back of your head with a rubber band or hair tie.


Use gel to slick back the rest of your hair. You don’t want it getting messed up when you’re fighting the bad guys.

, You need the cardio in order to perform your amazing martial arts moves, but you don’t want to look like a bodybuilder or a professional wrestler. Running on a treadmill, but never working out your core, while eating a lot of fatty foods will help you attain this look.


Don’t lift weights. Instead use a wooden training dummy to sharpen your skills.

, Snake skin or leather boots are ideal footwear for those acting like Seagal. Even though sneakers or shoes may seem more practical depending on the circumstances, boots are the only footwear that are acceptable.

Whisper when you speak to people.,
Learn and master the art of Aikido.,
Practice Buddhism.,
Have a love for animals and the environment.,
Keep cool under pressure.",How to Act Like Steven Seagal2," When you speak to your enemies in a whisper, it makes you seem tougher, and forces them to concentrate on what you’re saying. When you’re using it on a love interest, it makes you seem sexy and mysterious.


Never repeat yourself if someone asks what you’ve said, ignore that they even mentioned it.

, Seagal owns his own Aikido dojo in LA and has practiced since he was a teen,so if you haven’t started yet, you have some catching up to do.


Aikido is a Japanese martial art that centers around self-control and self-discipline. In Aikido, a person’s momentum is used against them for throws that are similar to the art of Judo.

, You must become a diehard Buddhist, and practice Eastern philosophy in Asia. You must always talk about Buddhism in a positive light and become a figurehead of the religion in the U.S.


Buddhism’s core belief system revolves around virtue, self-control, and wisdom, much like the art of Aikido. , Try creating movies that revolve around trying to take down polluters, and raise the awareness of environmentalism to the public. You must also have a love for animals, and be willing to defend them at a moment's notice.


In movies like “On Deadly Ground” and “Fire Down Below” Seagal takes on toxic polluters.
Seagal once crashed a tank through a person’s house because he suspected that they had a cockfighting ring., To act like Seagal is to be like the calm before the storm. Even though everything seems normal, it can dive into chaos at any moment. No matter what the circumstance, keep a cool demeanor.

"
"
Practice a raspy New Jersey or New York accent.,
Squint your eyes at all times, especially when thinking or concentrating.,
Act like you’re not trying, ever, even when in a fight.",How to Act Like Steven Seagal3," Even though Seagal was born in Michigan,he has developed what resembles an accent from New Jersey or New York City. Try practicing this accent while speaking in a low, raspy, whisper.


Watch Seagal movies and listen to his interviews if you have trouble emulating his voice.
Practice short one-liners first, then start to incorporate it into daily dialogue.

, Even though he wears sunglasses most of the time to prevent him from squinting, when your shades are off, make sure to squint your eyes and look somewhat annoyed or uncomfortable. This is the key Seagal look in most circumstances.


This look may also be applied when speaking to someone who you're mad or disappointed in.

, Maintain a quiet demeanor. Never look like you're putting forth any effort, even when you're disposing of hundreds of henchmen at once. Your goal is to appear as emotionless and chill as possible at all times.


Practicing Aikido and Buddhism may help you with this.

Determine if you can carry this look or not.,
Get a short pixie like hair cut.,
Bring out the eyeliner and mascara!,
Lightly Shape your brows.,
Try mixing cute T shirts with ""casual skinny jeans"" or boot-cut jeans and wear a short denim jacket, leather jacket or something ""boxy"" on top.,
Wear clear lipgloss or nude lips.,
Develop an artsy hobby or read interesting books!,
Play an instrument.,
Laugh a lot, have a good sense of humor, and want to show your playful and inspiring sides.,
Have fun with your new style!,
Hang out with boys!,
Wear earrings and deep red lipstick colors at night!",How to Be a Gamine,"  Most Gamine Girls are already naturally ""gamine like"" and they don't even know it. Are you playful? Cute? Fun to be around? Skinny or thin? Sometimes gawky or clumsy? Youthful in appearance? Have wide eyes? Men seem to like being around you? Then you can be a Gamine Girl!;
, You can get a cut that is multi-layered, some bangs, and get some side bangs or straight bangs. You must have your hair short in the back so your full neck is exposed! Look at 1920 Girls and then ask your hair stylist for a cut that she or he thinks will flatter your face shape. Your hair has to be short to be considered a True Gamine Girl.

, Your eyes have to be flirty and you must play them up to get all the attention on your eyes! If you have green eyes, light eyes, or blue eyes....use shades of light brown or deep sable browns on your eyes to play them up. If you have dark eyes use black, dark browns, or natural slate gray shades. If you use purple use only as a liner. Your eyes should not be obviously wearing eyeshadow. You can use eyeliner to shape them in a flirty way if you choose by adding a slight wing at the top end of your lash line.

, You might consider getting them waxed thinner to open your eyes more. Gamine girls usually have very shapely brows. You can tweeze them carefully at home as long as they are neat and have extra room underneath to open your arch. You want ""doe eyes"" and the brows must be thin and or very neat and groomed to be Gamine.

, Gamine girls look ""feminine"" but have a tomboy appearance. So don't wear sexy over the top dresses or clothes. Instead look for long soft flowing skirts, v-neck t-shirts, short styled jackets and blazers. Try to look as if you don't waste time on ""fashion"". Gamine Girls focus on their NATURAL beauty.

, During the day you must wear very light shades of lipstick if you choose to wear any at all. Or you can wear lip balm instead. Gamine Girls do not wear an obvious amount of make up. At night ...you can wear a bold matte color of Red because it appears like a French 1920s cute girl...who is trying on red lips for the first time. Gamine Girls are not aware of their ""powerful beauty and appeal"" so you must be playful with it.

, Gamine Girls are unusually talented in something. Most Gamine Girls love to paint, draw, dance ballet, are actresses, *drama class* and do something intriguing and interesting. Reading many intelligent books ( like Sophocles, philosophy, Aristotle, religious books, and other ""spiritual and intellectual"" pursuits are what make Gamine Girls so extra appealing! Most artists used ""Gamine Girls"" as their muses in art, drawings, paintings and other creative endeavors like classical music.

, You must be able to sing, write music, or play guitar, bass, drums, or anything that is not very common or deeply feminine. Playing something exotic like ...the harp, the violin, the cello, and anything inspiring will win you Gamine points. You can play the piano but you must be very good at it if you do.

, You cannot be depressive, dark, evil or anything of that nature if you want to be loved as a Gamine Girl. Say little at first then slowly open up to your friends, dates and whoever else in your life. You must show ""mystery"" at first and then show your fun sides so the person thinks you only opened up to them! This is what makes a Gamine Girl so irresistible!

, People will start treating you as a Gamine Girl if you look the part. The true Gamine Girl is ""kind of tall, thin, gawky at first, funny, sweet, playful, and always effortlessly pretty, no matter what she does. She has a tomboyish appeal because she likes to do boyish things and she is adventurous and willing to get her hands dirty. This is what makes her so appealing to men! Have fun being Gamine!

, Gamine Girls are naturally invited to boy circles and usually they are the only girl hanging out with the boys and or men. You can have a few girls who are friends but true Gamine Girls are the ultra cute looking tomboy in every crowd!

, Then when the boys see you...they think she is so pretty even though she is cool like us! That's Gamine for you!

Carefully study her facial expressions.,
Spend hours practicing.,
Watch her videos.,
Practice her movements in front of the mirror.,
What would Marilyn do?,
Always check yourself in the mirror.,
Learn from mistakes of others.,
Be charming.,
Look like her.",How to Act Like Marilyn Monroe," Marilyn Monroe image is not just makeup and hair. If you carefully would study her facial expressions on every picture, you would notice how kind and open she looked. Also, if you look at her pictures and ask yourself how do they make you feel, you will probably find that her facial expressions evoke feelings of love and warmth. You almost want to hug and kiss her when you look at her pictures.;
, At the beginning of her career, Marilyn Monroe dedicated hours in front of the mirror carefully practicing her body language and facial expressions. She looked for and found that perfect image that everybody liked and still likes. If you want to even come close to how this actress acted, do the same. Practice, practice, and practice. Take a picture of her and put in front of you. Stand in front of the mirror and try to copy the exact same facial expression as on the picture. Do that with as many pictures as you can and until you are satisfied with your results.

, Try to find as many interviews with her on YouTube or wherever as possible. If you really want to act like MM, then make it your daily routine to watch her interviews at least twice a day. But do not just watch it. Pay close attention to her facial movements. Ask yourself: ""How does her eyebrows move? her lips, her eyes?"" Practice smiling like her. When watching you will notice that whenever she laughed she tended to tilt her head up a little bit, so the teeth will be seen. Her eyebrows would always be slightly raised while her eyelids would be slightly down, so her eyes are half open.

, Just like you practiced her facial expressions, trying to mimic her expression on the picture, do the same thing, but in motion. Marilyn Monroe was not only picture perfect. She was always perfect, when she talked, when she walked, when she smiled, always. So when you watch her interview, pause it and try to repeat what she just said with the exact same body movements and facial expressions as she just did in her interview. Try it until you reach perfection.

, Wherever you are, make it your priority to always think what Marilyn Monroe would do and how she would react to certain events happening to you in the moment, whether you are buying an ice cream, getting out of the car, being late somewhere or meeting an old friend or a new person. Of course, you have never met Marilyn personally and do not know how would she act if she were you, but you can gain some of this knowledge by doing step number 3 and also, by watching as many of her movies and as many times as possible.

, No matter if you are a teenager or an adult, you probably already have a certain behavioral style. As your day goes, you might forget about Marilyn and her expressions and her movements and that you are supposed to act like her. Well, do not forget about that. If you are passionate about acting like her, then constantly remind yourself to make that face and check in the mirror if the desirable expression comes out good. If not, then practice.

, You are not the first person in the world trying to act like Marilyn. Many many stars have tried to channel her (Nicki Minaj, Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Lindsay Lohan), but miserably failed. Even other stars are inspired by her like Anna Nicole Smith, Courtney Stodden, Mariah Carey and more. And they look beautiful. Try to see why. They all had incredibly talented makeup artists, stylist, and photographers to make them look like her. They still could not manage it. Why? They lacked the most important thing: her feminine softness and kindness. Take one picture of Marilyn and one picture of the trying star and see what's wrong. You will see that it is the facial expression.

, Marilyn was simply charming. She was described as a kind, affectionate and sympathetic person who hated to see anyone hurt. She was also described as a sexual magnet, who evoked the desire and passion. To do that, you should change your mindset. If you are always stressed, nervous, unhappy, you won't be able to act like her, simply because she never acted like any of those things. She always looked exact opposite-- relaxed, enjoying and happy--even in her hardest days. She was a great actress for not ever letting her feelings show. You can try to do the same. Each time you are irritated with something or stressed, remind yourself that you should act like Marilyn Monroe and make that angelic face that she always had on. Again, look in the mirror and see if it comes out right.

The Goa'uld are megalomaniacs.,
They believe others are below them, thus they are extremely arrogant.,
Behaving like a Goa'uld is a lot about perception and presence.,
If you look at a Goa'uld like Apophis and the way they took SG, they had clothing that looked inspired by Ancient Egypt, but took it a bit far and made it look more sci-fi than anything.,
Either style is fine, many prefer the look of the sci-fi, other die hard fans of the movie will prefer the traditional look.,
If you look at the MMO that was in development, Stargate Worlds, you can decide how you would operate based on the three (the first two are the important ones here) Goa'uld play styles.

,
Servant Lord: This is the one that would wear the elaborate style clothing, relying mainly on their technology and troops to own their enemies.,
Battle Lord: This is the style that you mostly see Apophis in when he goes off to another world or on a mission.,
Looking more in-depth at it, you could say the characters from Unreal Championship were based on Stargate characters.,
Acting like a Goa'uld is mainly about your presence and your look.,
However, this will probably lead to most people just thinking you are a jerk.,
Goa'uld do not take crap from anyone unless they think it will benefit them.,
Goa'uld would be rich.,
Goa'uld strength comes from their followers as well, battle lord or servant lord.,
These are just a few guidelines, but to be taken as fun.",How to Act Like a Goa'uld from Stargate," They are self-serving, arrogant and a bit intimidating. They command people left and right, even when they are not in the position to be giving the orders. (See the Enemy Within, char: Charles Kawalsky);
, Be arrogant, but do not be a bastard. There is a difference.

, They are known for their elaborate clothing. Take a look at the clothing of people today if they go into battle. Tight, form fitting, usually pants. The Goa'uld (even the male personality ones) wear things like long dresses and loose clothing. They don't fight using strength and hand to hand combat because they have technology that allows them to pwn your face from afar. It's kind of ridiculous seeing that the symbiote gives the body increased strength and everything.

, They wore chain mail looking outfits showing no more than their hands and face. In the movie, Stargate, the guards wore schenti, sandals, a top (usually midriff bearing) and their totem masks.

, In today's world, that's your choice. Many people are starting to get interested in the older style of things, so you may not look too alienated if you went the elaborate clothing style versus the war mode style.

,, They'd be very commanding and intimidating, blasting people around with their hand device and ribboning everyone into submission.

, This is the chainmail style that looks reminiscent of Ancient Egyptian style, but updated for the sci-fi look.

, They achieved the blend of sci-fi and Ancient Egyptian culture very well. I think it was probably the colors and the fact they wore actual loin cloths instead of a weird rigid schenti.

, Take an acting class to learn how to speak more fluidly and move in a controlled manner. Walk and talk slow as if the world needs to slow down and move at your pace. Learn to control conversations you enter into. Act mostly non-interested in other people and as if you have more important things to attend to.

, Acting like a Goa'uld can lead you to be loved by many people because if done correctly, you can come off very strong and sure of yourself rather than a tyrant and rude bastard.

, Apophis was not above making Sokar think he was all loyal and following of him. Therefore to be a Goa'uld you must be cunning and sneaky. Never let anyone in on your plans unless they have undying loyalty for you. Note: This can not be a person who is of very high self esteem or arrogant themselves, it may eventually lead into a battle of who is more powerful of the two of you, literally. Conceal your motives.

, Money is power in today's world. Money can earn you the loyalty and respect of people because they follow the person with the most paper in their pockets. These are the flunkies that eat out of every rich person's palm. Get wealthy and then protect your wealth. Invest and build a literal empire.

, So, do not neglect your followers. Goa'uld mostly played on their claim to divinity and using their technology to look Godlike. Unfortunately, this tech is not available to do that. So, do not treat your underlings like crap. That's why there are many revolts going along. Listen to your followers, do not allow them to get out of line, but listen to them. People will follow a reasonable ruler who is down their in the fray with them rather than a removed ruler who makes it appear as if they do not matter to them.

, Goa'uld are not real and neither is Stargate. Behaving too strictly to this list may earn you a beating from people who don't like your attitude. Don't pick up behaviors that you can't back up.

Learn how to strike one pose for all your photos one that makes you look great!",How to Be Inspired by Paris Hilton," Though this step is not completely necessary. If you decide to dye your hair, try a light platinum blonde.;
, Ever notice how Paris's hair is long one minute, and short the next? If you can't afford to get it cut and get extensions all the time, just make sure you do it differently every day. Alternate from straight to curly, tied up in a high ponytail to in low pigtails. Paris has actually always been short, but she often wears hair extensions. Try to get a plain extension that you can style yourself. The best thing to try is clip-in extensions, you can get them anywhere from eBay to Sally's.

, Don't put too much on. Don't make it streaky and don't let it turn you orange. The point is to look like you just got back from Barbados, instead of looking like you put on self-tanner.

, Paris is known for her great shoe collection. You do not always have to wear heels, as long as if they are really cute flats (tennis shoes have to be cute and clean -- not dirty). Most of your shoes should be pink. Pink high heels are essential. If you're not that comfortable with high heels, cute pink flip flops will work too! Try to get a huge selection of shoes, even if they are not very expensive.

, But make sure whatever you wear, you started it, not anyone else!

, If you make yourself the ultimate party essential, then you will get automatic invites! Be known at a party; as Paris said in episode number 2 of The Simple Life 4: ""Don't be a floor hog, stay in the VIP room for a while, or else you will look desperate.""

, If you do, you can do whatever you want instead of having one steady boyfriend.

, Don't hesitate to liven up a party or draw attention to you or act a bit selfish and bossy.

, Paris never gives a flying fish about what people think about her. Go ahead and wear a crazy hairstyle, or something that people wouldn't expect you to wear. Be that trendsetter, go do crazy, stupid things, laugh at your mistakes, and you'll be a Paris in no time!

, You always need your girls, to hang with at the parties, talk about those dreadful rumors that just started about you, and of course - the boys! You must have one best friend that you do everything with! Fall out a lot and have a lot of arguments! Be seen everywhere with them, and do exactly the same thing! Never, ever be on your own! This friend is like your assistant, they should follow you and be willing to do anything for you! Don't treat her like rubbish! And make sure she is a brunette, and wears all the latest fashion!

, When you need help with something, (which, if you're really like Paris, would be everything.) Playing dumb isn't always bad. It's actually a good flirting technique. It's what Paris does!

, ""That's hot"", ""that's beyond"", and ""oh baby"" are all good ones! Toss it into any sentence and people will automatically think of you as a little Paris! But whatever you do, don't steal Paris' name; that's just not cool.

, Paris is popular for this,and everyone will think that you're a socialite!

, Everything you own must be pink! Pink is your friend. Like it, and wear it. Everything you have in your wardrobe should relate to pink in some way. Own pink minis, and pink camis. If you are still in school, flaunt your love of pink with folders, bags, pens...all in pink! Make sure everyone knows your fave color!

, Paris style glasses would be pink with diamonds, or white framed! You can find these in most shops! If you want to accessories further, try cool headbands or cute dangly earrings with some sparkle on them!

, Paris has the same pose in 97% of all her pictures, so you need to do the same. Use one that will always make you look great no matter what you are looking like that day. Every time someone wants to snap your picture use that pose.

First things first- you need to look the part!,
OK, we've gotten to the really important part- clothes!,
You need the personality!,
Skye is the most popular girl in the 8th grade.,
Skye takes dance lessons and is very good at it.",How to Look Like Skye Hamilton from the Clique Series," Skye has shiny, long, wavy blonde hair, Tiffany box-blue eyes, and clear, tanned skin.


If your hair is not already long, get extensions. If you can't afford them, get the clip-on kind. Dye your hair blonde if it isn't already. It's fine if you want to keep your hair the way it is- whatever looks best on you. Use a good-quality curling iron to get cute curls, but be sure to apply heat-protectant to your ends, first. Try using a clamp-free one, or just wrap your hair around the barrel of the iron instead of using the clamp. You're aiming for a cute, beachy curl, more of a tight wave than a perfect ringlet. Flip your head upside down and back up, then arrange your curls with your fingers. Use good shampoo to make your hair glisten, and good conditioner to make your hair smooth and tangle-free. Use cold water and a teaspoon of vinegar while shampooing to make your hair ultra-shiny. But remember, being like her isn't all about pretty appearance. You just need the alpha confidence.
If you don't have blue eyes and you want them, get a good pair of contacts.
Use a good zit treatment to keep your skin from any potential breakouts. If you have dry skin though use a good moisturiser and cleansing soap. Put on some good sunscreen too! To get a healthy, glowing tan, use self-tanning lotion or spray, or go to a spray-tanning salon. Bronzer is a good option also. (In small amounts.) Don't cake bronzer on. You'll look over done, and the opposite of the fresh, pretty look that we're going for. Too much self tanner might turn you orange. You really don't want to look like Lindsay Lohan. Trust me. Tanning from the sun can be dangerous. And NEVER EVER go to a tanning booth!! They cause premature skin aging, wrinkles, age spots, and skin cancer. It is not worth risking your health to be tan! Use very light, natural colored makeup. Bronze or tan-colored eyeshadow is good. Use one or two coats of mascara. Make sure it doesn't clump. If it does, buy a non-clump mascara or invest in a high-quality eyelash comb. Also have a few tubes of lipgloss on you. If you have a few blemishes, it's best to let your skin breathe instead of covering it with makeup. But, if your skin is noticeably uneven, Bare Minerals is perfect for foundation, it looks great but doesn't clog pores.;
, Skye's wardrobe is absolutely AMAZING. Her parents own a dance boutique, so she gets clothes from there for free. Shop at the cutest boutique near you. Skye is also known for her glamour-dance style- Aka dancey couture. Cute, dance pieces paired with adorable details, such as a mini-tutu over a pair of super-skinny jeans, legwarmers, a decorative tiara, etc. If you want want something a little less bold, try a pair of cute black yoga/dance pants and a baby pink or sky blue ballet tee. All of these pieces can add some Skye to you. Skye is a dancer, but if you aren't, you can add something from your sport to your wardrobe if you would like. She also has a few expensive designer pieces, such as Coach handbags, Juicy sweats, Prada shirts, etc. So, if you can afford it, add some designer items into your wardrobe. Also, try to add a bit of your own style to your outfits and Skye's style.

, Skye's attitude is a lot sweeter than Massie's, but she can be tricky when she wants to. Be nice to everyone you can possibly stand to be nice to. But, if someone makes you mad, don't be afraid to snap a little. Skye is also very flirty and has kissed a long list of boys, multiple times. If a guy gives you a ride, give him a Hershey's kiss.

, She is the leader of the DSL Daters, known for their super fast connections with boys. Find five other girls that are already close with you and popular (It helps if you all have something in common, like the same hair color) and gain their respect and devotion. They'll make you their leader... their alpha.

, Sign up for as many different types of dance as you are able too, such as ballet, modern, jazz, hip hop, tap, and any other type you enjoy!

Put together Peyton's everyday style.,
Put together her ballet/dancing outfit.",How to Act Like Peyton from The Game Plan1," Peyton is a ballet dancer and therefore dresses with class to represent that. She wears blazers, mini jean skirts over thick tights. Some shoes to go with Peyton's outfit would be UGG boots, penny loafers, and other cute shoes. Jeans and cords would also go great with her outfit. Peyton loves pink, so try to find any cute pink shirts to go along with her outfit. Take this into mind when dressing, because you won't go wrong. Since her dad was Joe Kingman, a pro football player, she occasionally wears football jerseys.;
, She wears ballet leotards in pink, white, blue, and purple colors. Tights are usually worn underneath. Her hair is always pulled back into a ballet bun. Occasionally, a skirt will be worn over the leotards.

Decide who you want to be.",How to Look Like the Clique Characters1," Do you want to be the witty fashionable alpha Massie, the sweet but clever Claire, the gossipy exotic beauty Alicia, the funny super-crazy Dylan, or the sporty smart chick Kristen? After you have decided which character you want to be, move on to the appropriate section below.

Massie is classy, so obviously when planning a wardrobe like Massie Block's, it MUST be classy.,
Once you have the clothes, you need the accessories.,
Don't forget the shoes!,
Put your outfit together.,
Don't forget the handbag!,
Top the look off with some neutral makeup.,
Do your hair.,
Consider the weather.",How to Plan an Outfit Like Massie Block," Classy doesn't mean that it has to be designer. Massie may have the money for a designer wardrobe, but you may not. Massie shops at Saks, Marc Jacobs, Tiffany and Co. etc., so if you have enough money to shop at these places, that's good. If you can't afford designer clothes, try stores like JC Penney, Wet Seal, H&M, or Macy's. When planning outfits out like Massie Block, never shop at Abercrombie, Aeropostale, Hollister, or any other stores where the brand is written on the clothing in big letters. Your clothes should not have any writing or pictures on them, because to Massie, that's tacky, and un-Alpha.;
, Like said above, Massie shops at stores like Tiffany and Co, but if you can't afford a Tiffany charm bracelet, go to stores like Sears and buy jewelry from their jewelry department. Buy some diamond/crystal earrings, or if you can't afford them, buy some cubic zirconia earrings (they look like expensive diamonds, but are really cheap fakes, but nobody needs to know that!), as well as a silver necklace and a charm bracelet like Massie's. Silver and gold are the only colours your jewelry should be.


Avoid stores like Claire's, because the jewelry there is too tacky and cheap for Massie.

, Massie would never be seen in shoes like Keds. Buy some kitten heels or pumps that look expensive and would make Massie proud.

, The colors must co-ordinate without looking too matchy-matchy. Add some accessories to make it all come together. Be stylish and make your outfit look as expensive and mature as possible.

, Massie always has a handbag with her to carry her credit cards in! Make sure that your purse looks as classy as possible.


Keep that purse clean and organized. Luna bar wrappers and expired lip gloss look tacky and gross.

, Don't overdo it. Make it look as natural as possible so that you don't look like a clown. When Massie wears makeup, she wears it in good taste.


Don't forget a quick swipe with some lip gloss (Massie never goes out with out her Gossip Girl lip gloss!) to make your lips shiny and kissable.

, Either straighten it extremely well or curl it in loose curls. Try as hard as possible not to make your hair frizzy, because Massie would never have frizzy hair. If you hair looks good, your outfit looks great.


Use a thermal spray before heat styling to prevent excess damage.
Some other cute styles include french braids, flirty ponytails, beachy waves, etc. Look at youtube for style ideas.

, The humidity, temperature,etc. can all play important roles in your outfit choice.

Wear your hair in a simple fashion.",How to Act Like Peyton from The Game Plan2," Peyton has thick, curly, dark, and is usually worn just down. You could also pin a piece on either side of the head back.

"
"
Be polite.,
Speak your mind and stand up for yourself.,
Be very brave and know how to get what you want.",How to Act Like Peyton from The Game Plan3," Peyton is very polite and acts like a young lady should.

, Peyton is not afraid to stand up for what she believes in, and will speak her mind when it matters.

, Peyton knows how to get her way very well. Peyton sneaked around and lied to her Aunt Karen so that she could meet her father. She was very brave to get what she wanted!

"
"
Learn to accessorize like Peyton.",How to Act Like Peyton from The Game Plan4," Peyton is very good at accessorizing; she has charm bracelets, a pink leather wrist watch, head bands, and even quilted pink hats. She carries a quilted tote bag to carry her notebook and her doll, Camille, and Camille's clothes. Peyton has a Sidekick cell phone that is bedazzled pink and white stones.

Act like Massie.,
If you want to act exactly like her, you have to develop a taste for fashion.,
Write a Current State of the Union.,
Have a sidekick pet!,
Her favorite color is purple!,
Have your signature thing!",How to Look Like the Clique Characters2," If you don't have them, try a hair dye and colored contacts, but this isn't a necessity.;
, Massie wears subtle, trendy, and natural-looking make-up, like lip gloss, eyeshadow, blush, mascara, and bronzer. Get what you think will look good with your colors. If you have a strict family, or can't afford make-up right now, Massie is not the character for you (try Claire or Kristen). If you think you have what it takes and this is the only dilemma you have, use chap-stick. DO NOT buy any cheap make-up. Don't buy foundation, cover-up, or powder from Claire's, because it could severely ruin your skin.

, You may want to get really expensive clothes if you can afford it like Prada, Gucci, Chanel, Juicy, etc. But if you can't, try cheaper (but still fashionable) cute clothing lines, such as L. A. M. B., A&F, American Eagle, PacSun, Hollister, and Forever 21. Don't go any lower than that, and you need at least a few designer items, namely: at least one pair of designer jeans, at least 3 Juicy Couture tracksuit hoodies, a few designer jackets, a few designer tops, and ALL your shoes NEED to be designer. Coach actually has pretty cheap shoes when they go on sale sometimes. You also need Juicy sneakers, a few pairs of Nikes for any intense sports, at least 3 pairs of REAL UGGs Australia and at least 2 pairs of designer heels, like Manolo Blahnik, Jimmy Choo, or Miu Miu.

, She is the queen of come-backs. She can outdo you in a flash. She has numerous catchy come-backs.

, Try being part of a local community Lip Gloss Club or a mini fashion shoot. Don't act too snobby, though, or your parents may ground you, and then you wouldn't be able to go to the mall. That would be a total nightmare! However, if that is a thing your parents would do, Massie probably isn't right for you. Massie's parents are REALLY, chill!

, In the books and movie, Massie has her own private (and sometimes public, as she does publish them to a blog and share them with others sometimes) way of sharing what is in and what is out. Try writing one everyday, and reflect it on that day's events (i.e., if your friend was mean to you, she can be marked OUT, while someone else could be IN. Same with adults, activities, objects, clothes, accessories, anything!).

, Massie is the only child, but in all the books, Massie has a sidekick: her cute dog, Bean. She also has a white horse, Brownie. If you have a pet, make him/her your sidekick pet. In one of the books, her ringtone was even Bean barking! Also, in all the books, Bean is included whenever the girls are at her home. Try to include your pet whenever your friends are at your house!

, Make sure you have purple everything! Massie also lives in a huge mansion and has a gigantic room with TONS of walk-in closets. Her room is pure white with a few accents of purple. As stated in the book, her room would look terrible if it were ALL purple!

, Massie has a Tiffany&Co. charm bracelet that became a major hit at her school all because of the trend SHE started!

Attain dirty blond hair and sea-blue eyes.,
Look rich.,
Kristen is extremely sporty!,
Kristen doesn't wear too much make-up since she is so sporty, just the light and simple bronzer, concealer/foundation, lip gloss (a must!,
Make your own trends.,
Act like her, too.",How to Look Like the Clique Characters3," If you don't have these, try getting contacts and dying your hair. If you don't prefer dying your hair, or getting contacts, then you can start your own trend and be a Kristen with your own look. If you still want to dye your hair but can't afford it, try squeezing lemon juice in a cup and putting it in your hair. Let it soak in and then wash it out after about 10 minutes. After you dry and brush your hair, it should be a little lighter.

, Kristen may be poor, but she definitely throws people off. She wears designer make-up and always looks like she came from a model shoot. She wears red lipstick so people notice her eyes more. If you don't have red lipstick and don't feel like buying any, then you may try to get a dark pink. Kristen has long eyelashes, and to keep from looking like an LBR, she wears mascara.

, She's the captain of her soccer team. Be involved in one of the more tomboyish sports. If you're not the captain, at least be a good player!

,), mascara, and sometimes eyeshadow. She also uses a lot of toner.

, Kristen is an only child and has very strict parents that make her go to school instead of the mall, but that doesn't stop her. Use ties as belts, jeans as beachy shorts, and earrings as pins. Trust me, no one will ever notice!

, Since she is very athletic and loves soccer, she is formally fit and is the hottest person out in that field.

Alicia always wear Ralph Lauren, is as gorgeous as a model, and is half-Spanish, half-white.,
Be picky.,
If your parents are strict, this is not the girl for you.,
Alicia is known to be even more beautiful than Massie, who is already too gorgeous for words!,
Alicia wears a lot of make-up.,
Be sneaky.,
Be kind of nice, but mean at the same time!,
Get a nice tan, but it should be natural!,
Become obsessed with the news.",How to Look Like the Clique Characters4," She has long, straight black hair with natural highlights and big, bright chocolate-brown eyes. She has a gorgeous natural tan all year-round! If you don't have these features, you are better off being someone else, because you cannot get this look out of a spray tan and a can of hair dye. Try to keep it natural.

, Alicia is always getting asked out and asked to go to dances, but she turns almost all of them down because she has way too much fun with her best friends (the PC!) You should also only settle for the best, and try to boost your popularity, but not to often. If a really hot guy asks you out, then say yes and dump him a week later. Don't dump him too early or you'll be seen as someone who dumps people really fast.

, Her dad is a famous celebrity lawyer who can get her everything and anything she wants, and her mom was a Spanish model who gives her everything!

, Alicia is the only child who lives in a giant mansion like Massie's. However, Alicia is known to be a tiny bit richer than Massie.

, Always wear lip gloss. It is usually a light pink, nude/peachy-cream, or clear color. She always wears mascara to make her eyes pop. Go exotic, but still cool. She also always wears eyeliner, blush, and sometimes eyeshadow. Try light blue eyeliner. Keep it to a minimum.

, Alicia is a total gossip queen and always has the best gossip about anyone. That sneak! The secret is simply talking to people, or doing something funny in class. You learn a lot more.

, Meaning really think about the right time to be nice, and the right time to be sassy. Be coy and nice, but not too nice, to your crush. Let him know that you prefer him over everyone else.

, If your skin color is very, very light, get a spray tan.

, Alicia loves knowing the latest news (how else would she be a major gossip?) and wants to be a reporter. Read the newspaper (or magazines hehe), and join your school's yearbook club, newspaper/journalism class or morning news show. Make your own broadcasts, and always end with a cute sign-off (Alicia's is 'I heart you').

Massie has sleek, shiny, beautiful hair.,
The frequency of washing your hair requires will depend on your hair type, but it's recommended that you limit your hair-washing to three times a week.,
Try air-drying your hair as much as possible, for heat is your hair's worst enemy.,
Since Massie has chestnut brown hair with caramel colored streaks, you may want to ask a professional to dye your own hair in a similar shade to look even more like her or dye it yourself.,
Massie mainly has her hair curled, although she sometimes straightens it.",How to Look Like Massie Block1," To achieve this, you'll need to purchase a very good shampoo and conditioner that will help bring the desired results to your hair without hurting it. Ask your hair stylist for advice on what to get for your hair type. You can also try some drugstore brands, such as ""Herbal Essences"". As mentioned in some of the books in the series, Massie Block usually has her hair parted right. This can be seen on the book cover of the book 'Charmed and Dangerous.


If you have some money, purchase a few of those salon products that your stylist mentioned.
If you have not enough or no money, purchase one or two of the products that your stylist has on sale. Then, wait for the rest of the needed products to go on sale.

For example: When that deep conditioner you've been eyeing goes down a few dollars, immediately purchase it!

;
, Purchase different brands of shampoo and conditioner to get soft, shiny hair, but make sure you stick with the correct hair type. If you find that one brand isn't working, try another!


If you have oily or greasy hair and washing it three times a week isn't working, try washing it four times a week, but never wash your hair every day or you'll wear it out.
Try rinsing your hair with cold water, as it will give it some shine.
Avoid using hot water when showering, as this is bad for your hair. Water that is too cold isn't good for your hair as well. Therefore, it's best to stick with lukewarm water when washing your hair.

, Too much heat applied to your hair will cause damage and possibly split ends. However, if it's necessary for you to use a blow dryer on your hair, purchase one of good quality that has been well-made, but still keep the amount of heat introduced to your hair as low as possible.


After blow-drying your hair, run your fingers through the ends of your hair with a little bit of oil-free lotion. Not only will the lotion help eliminate frizz, but it'll also give your hair a non-greasy shine and contribute in getting rid of those split ends.

, However, if aren't comfortable with dying your hair, you aren't allowed to, or you already have her hair color, you can skip this step. Keep in mind that it's best to use temporary dye on your hair in case you change your mind about the color or looking like Massie.

, You should style your hair according to what looks best on you. Make sure you also have plenty of hair accessories to have a cute and functional style.


If you want curls, get a light perm, good quality curling iron, or you can twist a section of your hair over a chopstick and secure it with a rubber band. Do this all over your hair and leave it in overnight for spiral curls. Make sure you do it over damp hair and use a smoothing cream beforehand.
If you want straight hair, get a good quality straightener.
If you want waves, it's recommended you get some hair curlers and curl-enhancing mousse. However, if you want to naturally get your waves (this is much better for your hair than curling it):

Shampoo and condition your hair.
Once your hair is dry, ask someone to braid your hair into a tight French braid, or do it yourself.
Leave the French braid in overnight.
Take the French braid out in the morning.


Note that in the summer collection series, Massie has a streak of purple hair below her right ear.

(Act) Now that you've got the look, you need the attitude.,
(Act) Personality is important.,
(Act) People won't think you're somebody if you don't think that you yourself is somebody.,
(Act) You need comebacks.","How to Look and Act Like a ""Clique"" Girl"," You always have to have cute hair if you want to look like a 'Clique' Girl. Your hair must be something that people will copy. If you have hair you dislike, I have listed ways to fix your hair:


Oily hair? Oily hair is not cute. If you have oily hair, then wash your hair frequently, but not every day. Washing your hair everyday can damage it. Use shampoos that say that it prevents oily hair. Also, use conditioner for your hair. Do not apply the conditioner near your scalp as it will make your hair look greasy. After you rinse, comb your hair and apply small amounts of hair lotion or serum.
Dry hair? Wash your hair and immediately apply conditioner. Make sure your shampoo is a moisturizing shampoo. Make sure the shampoo has no sulfates. Sulfates cause your hair to dry out quickly. After, apply hair lotion or moisturizing serum.
African American hair? Wash your hair and condition. Then blow dry and style to however you like. You must use a flat iron first! Then you may curl or wave your hair, but you do not want the top of your head to be frizzy! Always flat iron first! Just comb your hair and then use the flat iron so that your hair is even. This makes better straightening.
Straight hair? After washing and blow drying, you can crimp or curl your hair. This will give you a cute but subtle look.;
, Bad hygiene is one of the gateways to ""losership"". To avoid this, brush your teeth twice a day (or three times a day) and floss after every meal. You do not want to have stuff between your teeth while you are talking and you definitely do not want bad breath. Also, you need to wash your face at least twice a day to get rid of pimples. Don't forget to wash yourself. If you have odor/sweating problems, wash yourself twice in the morning and then use body wash. After, put on a perfume that smells good, shave armpits if needed, and then apply deodorant. PUT ON LOTION. Being ashy is one of the nastiest things ever!

, Clothing is simple. Find something cute that people will copy after a while of wearing it. If needed, iron jeans and blouses for a fresh clean look. If you need help with clothes, look up a list of clothes that are 'in'. If your family is rich (and I mean RICH) then you can wear some of those designer pieces. If your family is middle class, shop at department stores like Topshop, Love Culture, Papaya, Macy's, Kohls, or Gap/Old Navy. If you are on a budget, shop at Sears, Forever 21 (very in-style!) or work with what you have. For make-up, go to MAC or Sephora. They give you free makeovers as long as you buy one of their products. Try to copy the make over they gave you with products you have at home. If you have sensitive skin, use Neutrogena Products.

, Every 'Clique' Girl has their own way of taking somebody down. You have to be confident and clever. Don't let people take charge of you. Confidence is key!

, If you are weird, then keep your thoughts in your head. JUST DON'T BE NORMAL! NORMAL IS BORING!

, You need to convince people you're amazing. Looking the part will only get you halfway there. Walk the halls with your head held high and ooze confidence. Make a statement that says, ""Yes. I am all that and don't mess with me.""

, Comebacks are important. That will show whomever is bothering you that they can't push you around anymore. Just DON'T USE PROFANITY. That is not lady-like in any way. A good way to get comebacks is to write them down and develop creativity. Also, study the dictionary so your comebacks will work better.

, If you have your mom or dad or an older sibling check your answers, you'll get the answer more often. They'll probably tell you what's wrong, what's right, and help you with what you need help with.

, The best way to get things right is to pay attention in class. By listening, you will have enough knowledge to get the top marks. Don't pass notes or chit-chat in class: be the one who knows everything.

, That way, you appear to know everything. This will also help you understand the topic better, and therefore you will find class work and home work less difficult.

They get pricey, but the pricier they are, the longer they last. Contacts won't be a breeze because stores rarely have shiny emerald contacts, but you can try a tealish-blue.

, Dylan is very tall, a whole head taller than Massie, so she naturally has long legs. Dylan is obsessed with her weight .

, Dylan has a famous mother, the host of the talk show ""The Daily Grind."" She gets whatever she wants and her make-up is gorgeous. She has access to her mom's celebrity wardrobe and stylists! Her mom's H&M (Hair and Make-up, NOT H&M the store!) stylist usually does her H&M for her, so she always looks great! Her favorite color is reddish-pink. She usually wears quite a bit of make-up, but still maintains that fresh, rosy, natural, glowy look! She usually wears green or rose-pink eye shadow to bring out her eyes/hair and either light red lipstick or light pink/clear gloss. She wears light orange blush, and to keep the burst of color going, she wears pitch black eyeliner. Don't worry, it doesn't look gothic at all!

As the series progresses, however, Claire gets TONS of hand-me-downs from Massie, so she gets a bit more fashionable. Buy at least one pair of Keds. Claire always wears them.

Make sure you have nice eyebrows.,
You can also get your eyebrows electrolyzed.,
One technique that is virtually painless and has amazing results (better than plucking and waxing because you will get perfect and straight lines) would be threading.",How to Look Like Massie Block2," Well-groomed eyebrows can make your pretty face totally stand out and help your makeup look just right. Bushy eyebrows - while not necessarily bad - aren't the best, but neither are over-plucked ones. For the best results, go to a salon to get them waxed or plucked.


If you are younger and getting your eyebrows done for the first time, try getting them plucked to avoid damaging your eyebrows.
If you want to pluck them at home, use good pair tweezers with slanted ends to get all the unnecessary hairs and be very careful not to damage your brows. It takes a while for the hairs to grow back.

It will help a lot by asking someone with experience with tweezers, such as your mom, big sister, experienced friend, or a beauty counter assistant. You should always pluck the hairs between your eyebrows and use some brow gel to get a clean finished look.



, It may hurt a little, but the hair won't grow back. However, keep in mind that you may have to get a few appointments set up because it takes about 3-5 sessions for it to work.

, It takes only a few minutes and has beautiful results that will last for weeks. It's also done by a professional to eliminate possible accidents that come with plucking and does not have the redness after waxing gives you.


How you choose to get your eyebrows done is your choice; either way, you'll get beautiful results!

Massie wears the full out makeup: eyeliner, mascara, eyeshadow, lip-gloss, foundation, and blush.,
Always brush your teeth.,
Shop for clothes at the right places.,
Get a designer purse, and wear it everywhere.,
Your purse is like your room, but in a bag!",How to Look Like Massie Block3," She makes it looks natural to bring out her features and doesn't overdo it. Natural make up is important. If you use too much, you will either look like a clown, an LBR, or somebody else - not yourself. As the queen herself always says, ""Your beauty must seem effortless, or people will stop wanting to be you.""

, Massie always makes sure she has a clean mouth (because bad breath turns people away!) Make sure your teeth are white too. If your teeth are stained, use whitening strips or a whitening toothpaste. Using an electric toothbrush (like the Spin-brush) helps because it removes more plaque more efficiently than manual toothbrushes.


If you have braces, get clear bands so they are less noticeable. You could also pick some pretty colors.

Be careful with green; it might look like there's something stuck in your teeth (ex: salad).


Chew teeth-whitening gum and always have mints on hand.

, Even though Massie may have the money to afford a new wardrobe, you may not. You could go to Abercrombie, Hollister, Wet Seal, Delia*s etc. or find clothes elsewhere that at least look designer. Marshalls is a good place to shop; they have secondhand designer clothes that are way cheap. You can create runway-worthy outfits even if they're not designer.


Stores like TJ Maxx and Nordstrom Rack also have discounted designer clothes.
Read ""Teen Vogue"" and ""Seventeen"" to know what’s in style and what's not.

, If there's anything Massie-like that's truly worth the splurge - and that you know you'll like it even after your Massie phase - make sure to get it if you have enough money.


Hobos and satchels work best, for they are perfect for storing anything and everything!
Small purses or cute clutches can also be considered handbags and are probably a better idea for going out.

, However, make sure you don't overpack. Keep your cell phone in your bag in an easy place to reach at all times; an alpha never ignores a call or text. Always keep in your bag:


Your favorite flavor of lip gloss
Your cards
Pictures
A mirror/compact
Time of month things (pads,diva cup,tampons,etc.)
Personal organizer or a password diary/journal

Note: Massie will never use a diary that comes with lock and key because she says it can easily fall into enemy hands


Pens and pencils (go for mechanical pencils, they look nicer)






A notebook (for any random thoughts or brilliant ideas)
Extra makeup for touch-ups
Anything else you need or want.

Make sure you have a lot of technology ""extras"" too.,

Get fit.,
Massie has flawless skin.,
Try getting a cute pet.,
Get your sleep!",How to Look Like Massie Block4," The cell phone, PalmPilot, computer, music player and entertainment system will help you achieve that impeccable Massie Block sophistication. Massie has a Motorola phone in the earlier books and upgrades to an iPhone later on. However, it doesn't matter what kind of cell phone you have, as long as it works well and looks cool (try to get a touchscreen or iPhone).


You need a cell phone, so don't text during classes or at inconvenient times like Massie does. Otherwise. your teacher, principal, or parents will most likely take away your phone.
For computers, a laptop works best because it takes up less space than a desktop and is usually less expensive.

, You can also get a cool Mp3 player. The Palm Pilot is something worth the splurge, as popular people are very social and busy. If you are not allowed to get both a Palm Pilot and a cell phone, get a smart phone.


Add Swarovski crystals to your items for a touch of glamour.

, Massie's signature accessory is her charm bracelet - they're timeless, pretty and - depending on the charms you add - you can make it on your own. Buy a chain (Juicy Couture has great starter bracelets) and look for charms that define your personality (ex: a soccer ball if you like soccer). Your signature item can be anything you want if you don't like charm bracelets.


Massie gets her charm bracelet from Tiffany and Co., but if you can't afford it or simply dislike charm bracelets, then don't buy it.
Buy a good watch, bangles, rings, earrings, and plenty of necklaces that you know you'll still wear after your Massie phase.

, Obviously, use your favorite color if it isn't purple, but you should consider re-doing your room to add to the Massie persona. Go to Macy's or Bed Bath & Beyond to get a few of these items. Ordering off PB Teen is a good idea, too. Your room should look be a fabulous reflection of the fabulous you! If you can't get rid of your kiddy bed or can't afford a couch at the moment, smaller items like accent pillows, rugs, curtains, flowers, chairs, a clock and blankets will ice the cake in no time with minimal effort.


Massie's room is completely white with touches of purple! She has white walls, a purple duvet cover on her bed, white sheepskin rugs, a chandelier and candles for lighting, entertainment system, white desk with a bulletin board above it with pictures of her and the clique, white chaise, a sleigh bed (and a smaller one for Bean), and a shelf with horse-riding awards and trophies.
Also, don't forget a mannequin! Massie's is custom made to fit her every year, but you could just purchase one from PB teen. If you can't buy a different one every year, then don't buy one at all - firstly, it's not a necessity. Secondly, your clothes won't fit it anymore so it will just clutter up your bedroom.

, Massie has a huge collection of Glossip Girl lip glosses. She uses a different flavor of gloss every day! Since Glossip Girl doesn't really exist, you should use a nice brand like MAC, Shu Umera, etc. You can also try lip gloss from Victoria's Secret Beauty Rush. It is not very expensive and they have some great deals like 2 for $15 or 5 for $20. They have tons of flavors and usually come on sale around Christmas time. If you cannot afford those brands, try drugstore makeup brands like Maybelline and Cover Girl.


Also, a lot of the lip glosses Massie has in her collection (Red velvet cupcake, cotton candy, and a bunch of other cute stuff) are available at Bath and Body Works, the Liplicious brand. The cupcake collection isn't on the website now, but try amazon.com for red velvet cupcake lipgloss and so on. Bath and Body Works even does special Halloween brands like Treacherous Treats!

, Massie is quite skinny and does all she can to keep her frame fit and trim. If you are a bit overweight and want to drop a few pounds, try eating healthier snacks and exercising. Take up a sport (Massie rides her horse, Brownie, by the way) and eat smaller but more frequent meals. Working out in a gym or on a treadmill is a good way to lose some weight and stay healthy too. You can also go online and watch videos on how to make your body looked toned and fit. Massie does Pilates, yoga, and has multiple exercise DVDs.


When you're bored, and ""think"" you want a snack, chew gum, it gives your brain the illusion that you're eating something (plus it keeps your mouth fresh).
Don't lose too much weight, and don't, under any circumstances, be as obsessive about your weight as Massie's BFF, Dylan.






Go to your doctor. If he/she says you're at a decent height and weight, then you are! Whether you're trying to lose weight or just trying to maintain that adorable figure of yours, eating healthier and exercising is the best way to go.
Ask your doctor before going on a diet. If people are saying things that makes you uncomfortable about your body, ignore them and stay focused on your mission. Don't deprive yourself of the nutrients you need! This can lead to many health problems, such as anorexia or bulimia, and that is totally not good.
Try not to eat snacks with artificial flavors (Red 40, Blue 1, etc) and always check how much sodium and sugar is in whatever you buy at the grocery store.
Avoid eating those frozen meals that you microwave; they aren't healthy.
It's also a good idea to avoid tons of diet soda. It's been linked to bloating, loss of bone strength and even cancer. 12- 16 oz a week at the most.

, We all know that flawless skin won't happen overnight. You need a good skin care regimen that you stick to. It should consist of cleanser, toner (optional), and moisturizer. To find the right products for you, ask your dermatologist.


It is a good idea to look at products online so you can see the ratings people give the product. Sort the reviews from the most critical to avoid wasting time. The person can give the product only 3 stars just because of the packaging, but if a lot of people give it bad reviews for making them break out or something, then don't get it.

, It doesn't have to be a dog! Cats, rabbits, and guinea pigs are also very cute and are good pets. Pamper your pet like Massie does with Bean, it helps if you talk with your pet to get it to know your voice. Try not to leave your pet alone in a house by itself for a long time, it'll get bored and sad. If you must leave it alone, provide it with food, drink, clean bedding, a clean cage, and some toys.

, Dark circles and bags are NAWT in fashion. Aim for at least 8-9 hours.

Be open-minded.,
Wear unique clothes.,
Be your own person.,
Wear her jewelry.,
Talk like she does.,
Don't listen if someone tries to put you down.,
Be smart.,
Aim to be very creative.,
Be inspired, but don't copy her blindly.,
Be kind.,
Listen.,
Don't be arrogant.",How to Act Like Luna Lovegood," Luna accepts peoples' ideas, especially her father's. Think about something someone tells you before you shoot it down. Luna takes a minute to process what someone tells her, and when she makes up her mind, she replies.;
, Luna wears quirky, unique clothes. She never gets embarrassed with what she wears. Just be creative and look like you just stepped out of a Random Clothes Box. Somehow, she always manages to pull it off. Luna puts together outfits with pieces of clothing you never would have thought of.

, Do and wear what you want to; Luna does. Luna simply doesn't care about what people think of her. She is very comfortable in her own skin. Luna never tries to change who she is, and she never changes because someone says something about her. If you don't feel comfortable wearing your own clothes then search for some things Luna wears (and rocks!) in the movies and see if you have anything like it!

, Luna is known for her trademark butterbeer cork necklace and her radish earrings and her crazy Spectrespecs glasses. She enjoys them, no matter what anyone says. You can also buy some interesting jewelry or make your own. To buy some, you could go to a store that sells girl stuff or fun stuff. Claires' has good earrings for this type of jewelry.

, She always talks in a dreamy voice and stares into space with a slight smile when she talks. It's usually calm and soft, with something positive to contribute. Speak in a quiet, sing-songy, drifty, thoughtful sort of voice, and even if she's mad, she speaks in the same voice. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, she yells at Harry. But just remember who Luna is.

, It's okay; You're beautiful as you are no matter what they say. Just stare up and smile slightly when they say it; They're sure to realize you're not listening and then they'll stop. When they're done talking, say, ""Oh well, I like your shoes "" then walk away like nothing happened with your head up and your smile still on. This should leave the person bullying you stare at you and think, ""what?"" Who knows, this person might even grow fond of you! When Ron talks about Luna and calls her ""Loony"" she pays no attention.

, Always pay attention in class. Luna has good scores in tests and always get good grades, though some teachers may occasionally get upset when she insists that Wrackspurts and such exist. Luna was in Ravenclaw,and so she was smart and fun. Luna also reads. She reads her fathers magazine called ""The Quibbler"". Try to read a bit more if you don't already. You could subscribe to a magazine or newspaper if you wanted to read a magazine instead of a book.

, She once wore a lion hat to support the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and an eagle hat to support Ravenclaw. So don't be afraid to come up with an idea and wear it proudly. Luna also is creative with her bedroom, which had portraits she painted of her friends and stuff. You could get into the act of painting or decorating stuff, and spend some time doing some art and craft!

, Luna is Luna. Luna Lovegood might be your role model, but don't forget to be yourself too. If you don't want to follow these steps, then that's okay! Feel free to be yourself anytime, anywhere! Remember that no matter what you wear, do, or how you act, you were meant to wear it or do it. It's who you are. So don't change yourself.

, Luna is a very kind person, you never read about her mocking or being mean to another. She treats everyone as a equal (including house elves). No matter if it is a younger sibling, or if it is the person you look up to, be kind!

, Luna is a listener. She is the kind of person you could tell a secret to. You could tell her about your struggles or anything. Contribute to the conversation, but don't take it over and make it about you. That also comes from being a Ravenclaw; Ravenclaws listen so they can learn more.

, Luna was never one to brag about herself. After the 5th book where she went to the Ministry of Magic to fight Voldemort, she never really mentioned it as self praise. So if you get a 100% on a test, or help someone, don't go around telling people for self praise.

Add something purple to your uniform.,
Make sure your hair is neat, but simple.,
Wear only a little makeup and keep it natural.,
Try to smell nice.,
Now that you have the look, it's time to get the attitude.,
Be a good sport but not to enthusiastic.,
Act appropriate around your opponents.",How to Look Like Massie Block when You're Playing Sports," If purple is a school color, consider yourself lucky. If not, always ask permission from your coach to see if it's acceptable and if your coach doesn't mind, add something purple to your uniform. Good ideas would include purple scrunchies for your hair, a purple bracelet (plastic/rubber ones are good for this), or purple socks or shoelaces. Also, have a purple bag (preferably designer if you can afford it over purple, but both is even better) to hold all your stuff if you can. If none of these work, you can always get a purple water bottle and maybe add Swarovski crystals for more glamour. Purple happens to be Massie's favorite color, but if you hate purple and it's not mandatory (school color), you can skip this step.;
, Remember, you're going out for sports, not a party. If you have shorter hair or bangs, a skinny headband is perfect and for longer hair, pull it back in a high ponytail or bun. Above all, make sure your hair out of the way, neatly in place and make sure hair ties and headbands are in school colors, purple or your favorite color. Dry shampoo may also be a good idea in case it gets greasy, odds are likely. Tresemme and Aveeno both make great dry shampoos.

, ALWAYS wear sunscreen if you're outdoors. Avoid foundation, black eyeliner and lipstick at all costs, it will look SO bad when it runs. Try some sheer lip gloss, cheek stain (I LOVE Benetint and Posietint, you can also use them as lipstain) and curling your lashes. To prevent shine on your face, use blotting papers (Clean and Clears is the best) because oil-blotting powder will get cakey and could run, which looks awful.

, Like it or not, sports will cause you to sweat, especially if you're outside. During half-time or when you get the chance, go into the bathroom and dab yourself with a napkin, moist towelette or paper towel. ALWAYS wear a good-quality (preferably girlie scented) antiperspirant designed for sports. Dab a little bit of perfume behind each ear, just make sure it's not too heavy or you may cause a teammate to gag and we don't want that, do we?

, If you're sitting down on a bench, sit and casually look at the game. If the team scores, cheer and clap, but don't go too crazy. If you're playing, smile and stand confidently, no slouching! Be as focused as possible, be ready for anything, have excellent sportsmanship and follow all the rules, period. Never be caught any more than 6 feet (1.8 m) away from the ball if your playing in the field.


If you're a goalie in soccer, keep yourself focused on the ball and be ready to act at the drop of a hat. If that ball gets into the net, you're going to look stupid.
If you're a cheerleader, make sure you're doing all the movements correctly and keep your body tight. Never lose focus during stunts or when you're doing the half time dance, you could embarrass yourself or (even worse) get hurt.

, Smile when your team makes a point and if your team wins, get in a circle with your friends and jump up and down and giggle and what not. If the other team scores, look bemused but not like, ""CURSES! DRAT! They have made a point and now we will lose!!"". If they win, keep the bemused look but applaud lightly. Whatever you do, don't boo at your opponents or laugh at anyone who gets hurt. Alphas may be witty and clever, but they aren't THAT rude. No matter how popular you are, people WILL look down on you if you stoop down to that level

, Don't say anything more than what's necessary. Say 'good game' at the end, especially if your whole team does it, but don't do much more than that. But don't go to the other extreme and show complete disregard for them or even worse, laugh at their misfortune or make them feel bad. If they visibly need help carrying something or have hurt themselves, act on it and don't pretend it's not happening.

Keep up with your studies.,

When in school, put up your hand as high as it will go and try to answer EVERY question.",How to Act Like Hermione Granger," Hermione is very intelligent and does well in school. She loves to do schoolwork. Use your summer holidays to study everything that will come up next year. As Hermione once said, ""I've learned all the course books by heart, of course. I just hope it will be enough."";
,,, Except about study...always criticize how they haven't studied enough!

, Don't tell him of course, but keep to your studies while he messes around with a few Lavender Brown-type girls. Wait around for him and have faith that it will work out, he'll realize you're the one in the end and you'll have your education. And I don't mean this in a ""let him walk all over you"" way. I just mean, don't give up on him. There's only ever one perfect guy for us Hermiones!

, Always listen to everybody who has that kind of power over you (e.g., teachers, parents, etc.) except when they are most certainly in the wrong...eg., Professor Umbridge.

, That's what the real Hermione Granger would do.

Get the hair.,
Take good care of your face, and consider adding a little makeup to enhance your natural beauty.,
Be very well groomed.,
Dress like Alicia.,
Take good care of your nails, and wear white nail polish.,
Have stylish clothes.,
Her attitude is super nice with a dark side.,
Get some exercise, so you can have a healthy body like Alicia's.,
Alicia is the beta in The Clique so she doesn't copy, act like, or imitate Massie.,
Alicia is a gifted reporter and always knows what's going on.",How to Look Like Alicia Rivera from the Clique," Alicia's hair is glossy, long, and dark. While you don't have to create a perfect imitation of it, using a hairstyle inspired by hers will help you feel in touch with the character.


Take good care of your hair. Use deep conditioner to make it look look smooth. Using cold water instead of hot will make it shiny and seals the hair cuticle. Avoid heat styling when possible, and use a heat protector if you do.
Wear your hair long. Grow your hair about a inch above your elbows or 2 inches (5.1 cm) under your shoulder.
Be sure to get a shampoo and conditioner for your hair type. For example if you have dry hair get a shampoo and conditioner for that. If your hair is fine then consider getting a thickening shampoo and conditioner. In the Clique book Revenge of The Wannabes. It is said Alicia uses shampoo and conditioner from the brand Glisten.
Wear your hair wavy. Try washing your hair in warm water (cold makes your hair straight). Once it is dry, curl it with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) curling iron. This will help your hair feel soft and voluminous.;
,


Take good care of your skin. Wash your face twice a day, use oil-free cosmetics, and put on facial sunscreen each morning after you wash your face. (Sunscreen will protect your skin and make your makeup base look better.) If you're having acne trouble, consider going to a dermatologist.

, Always brush your teeth, and if you can use a teeth whitening kit. Pluck your eyebrows; it will make you look richer. Michelle Phan has some good eyebrow tutorials on YouTube. Give yourself a manicure and pedicure at least once a week. Moisturize all over your body after the shower, and also shave your legs and wax your under your arms. You don't want to wear a skirt, dress, shorts etc with hairy legs or have hairy underarms. That is gross!


Try wearing a little mascara, lipgloss, and blush.

, You'll want fashionable clothing that compliments your colors and personality.


Shop at designer stores. While Alicia's favorite designer is Ralph Lauren, you can also try Aeropostale, Hollister, Forever 21, H&M, and other trendy stores.
Try wearing V-neck sweaters, cargo pants, and dark jeans.
If you have money, try a purse by Coach, Michael Kors, Louis Vuitton, Prada, etc. If you don't have a lot of money, Juicy Couture has good purses at a good price. In your purse should be a cellphone, some lotion, perfume (Alica likes Angel by Victoria Secret), a nail file, makeup, an organizer, a flat iron (depends how your hair is looking that day), a magazine , lip gloss, a pen, and sunglasses.
Alicia avoids ""cutesy"" layers and always uses her own style.

, Alicia loves white nail tips.


If you bite your nails, try to stop. Find something else to do with your hands or mouth, and picture how beautiful your nails will look when they're neat!

, Alicia's favorite brand is Ralph Lauren, so be sure to purchase a couple cashmere sweaters, coats, jackets, and tops from Ralph Lauren. For jeans, purchase True Religions, Sevens, or Citizens of Humanity. Don't wear jeans everyday, wear jeans one day, a skirt the next, and maybe a cute dress the day after that. For lazy days, Juicy Couture sweatsuits are good. One suggestion is to read the Clique books and pay attention the outfits Alicia wears in the books. Watch the movie to get a visual idea, and google ""Alicia Rivera Inspired Outfits"" to know exactly what to buy. Alicia has big boobs but if your boobs aren't that big DO NOT STUFF your bra with tissue or anything. If anyone finds out you stuff, you are gonna look ridiculous, and who wants itchy tissue paper in their bra? But if you do have big boobs, then flaunt it. Also have a signature scent. Alicia's is the Angel perfume by Thierry Mugler. But you can choose any scent you would like.

, Be quick and snappy, and prepare a few good whiplash fast bite backs if someone dares to violate you. Say words like Point, I Heart __, Eh-Ma-Gawd, and Given.

, Don't forget that Alicia cannot run!


Alicia loves to dance, so consider signing up for a local dance class.

, That means don't copy a hair style from your Alpha, accessories, or outfit, even if it's to DIE for (unless she insists you need to). Another thing is if your alpha is thinking up a scheme, don't ask her ""Are you done yet? Are you done yet? Are you done yet?"" like the ah-nnoying kid in the back of the car going, ""Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?"" In other words don't be the cause of her anger.

, Maintain a network of friendships so you can stay on top of news.


Know the difference between telling news and gossiping. Never spread hurtful information about another person, and don't let your friends do so either.
A good guideline is to imagine the person whom the news is about. Would they be pleased or okay with your sharing it, or would they feel hurt? If it would upset them, don't do it.

Keep the clothes loose.,
Try wearing neutral, colors for a simple, basic, yet flattering wardrobe.,
Have as little accessories as possible.,
Always wear sneakers or converses.,
Choose Bella's colors.,
Wear your hair in a natural style.,
Keep makeup to a minimum.,
Wash well.,
Bite your nails.,
Have a signature fragrance.,
Have low self esteem.,
Walk gracefully.",How to Look Like Bella Swan from Twilight," Bella's never seen in anything bright or tight, she prefers loose and stark. Some key pieces in your wardrobe should be colours such as black, brown, purple, green,blue, grey, cream, beige, and white.


Wear what she wears: boot cut jeans, skinny jeans, hoodies, denim jackets, hooded coats, knit hats, stripey tops, converse, comfy shoes, blouses, checked shirts with a plain vest underneath, some dressy clothes like a blue dress and shrug that she wore to the prom (If you wear uniforms try to wear pants and dark colored shirts with sneakers or flats) . For your pajamas wear a plain vest/ t-shirt and loose patterned bottoms.





;
, Go for subtle pieces that don't make people wonder what you are wearing. Try finding basic t-shirts, jeans and simple jackets.

, Just have your iPod/mp3 player (she likes music), school books for studying, a laptop/computer, your camera (Charlie gave her one, Renee gave her a scrapbook), a plain school backpack in a block color, some gloves , some thin headbands, not too much jewelry: a silver (moonstone) ring and some black bracelets, a charm bracelet maybe and, knowing Bella, some plasters.

, Bella doesn't like dressing up much, so maybe when you have to wear a dress and perhaps a lot of jewelry, tone it down with a cool, casual pair of converse.

, Bella likes the colors blue and purple, so you could try wearing a lot of those colors, although this is not a must.

, Bella always wears her hair naturally (straight in the book but wavy in the movie) wavy with a cute thin headband. Never curl or straighten your hair. But if you have curly hair then straighten it. At a special occasion maybe have it in a loose curly hair do. If you have straight hair leave it in a bun/plait overnight and you will wake up to natural waves, but this is bad for your hair because then it will lead to dandruff and downfall. If you have curls leave them down but if you have frizzy hair either use non-frizz products.


She also has brown hair so if you have medium brown, dark brown or light brown hair that will be fine. Dye it brown you want to look like Bella. Any brown color will work.






Bella has long, brown hair, but if you like your hair type then there is no real need to change that. The biggest thing is to stay away from over the top styles (don't go around everyday with a red carpet-worthy up-do or anything of the sort); keep it natural.






Drool-worthy waves are achievable with both a flat iron and a curling iron; but if you don't want heat to damage your hair, try tying your hair in buns after shampooing and conditioning your hair. After your hair has dried you should have gorgeous waves! However, don't sleep with wet hair because it increases chances of dandruff and hair fall.
Alternatively, wear your hair straight like Stephenie Meyer pictures Bella.

, Bella doesn't wear much visible make-up so for your beauty regime, just brush your teeth (floss, use mouthwash), use face wash and apply moisturizer. If you need it apply a foundation that matches or is a shade lighter then your skin tone (remember to blend so it matches your neck). Apply a little bit of black/brown eyeliner (not like Jane's) and some black/brown/clear mascara (you could curl your eyelashes). Apply a clear/ beige/ light lip gloss or have nude lips but Bella usually has pink/dark pink lips so maybe just use a chapstick. Remember to remove your make-up at night with a face wash/ face wipes to avoid spots/pimples and if you get one don't pick at it just leave it and apply a little coat of concealer.


If you absolutely have to wear make-up, avoid things like primer, eye-shadow, lipstick, and eye-liner. Since Bella is very pale, don't go for bronzer, either (If you are dark-skinned then forget about trying to be pale, love your beautiful skin the way it already is). Instead, stick with small amounts of some basics, like:






A foundation in the same color of your skin tone, applied only in the places where you need it.
A concealer, applied over pimples and under the eyes.
A loose powder to prevent shiny skin. You can also carry blotting paper on the go if you wish.

, Shaving is optional, moisturize body + put on a deodorant and light body spray. Bella always smells nice!

, She bites her nails but that doesn't mean you should if you don't want to. Just keep them medium and natural.


Avoid nail polish.







, Bella's fragrance is nearly the main component in the first book and mentioned in all the others. She smells irresistible to vampires and slightly floral. You'll be surprised at the compliments you may get! Since Bella is basically a no-fuss person, go for crisp, clean scents. Musk is also the way to go. Go to your local mall to check out which scent is for you. Or if you want, you can apply a sweet-scented fragrance as in The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner she describes Bella's scent as ""seriously sweet"", but put on just a little.

, Bella is a very shy, timid person, her dominant personality trait is low self-esteem, but be confident in yourself. Wear things that you feel comfortable and happy in although, in Twilight and part of New Moon, Isabella's look can be described as plain. In the books Eclipse and Breaking Dawn, Bella finds part of her feminine side.

, Bella may be clumsy, but it's a graceful kind of clumsy. Improve your posture by keeping your back straight and your chin up.

If not possible, just dress a little more formal in public school than sweats and a tee.,
Be blonde.,
If you are just dressing like her for Halloween or a costume party, just get a platinum blonde, long wig.,

Have a boyfriend.,
Take a martial arts class.,
You are smart.",How to Act Like Fleur Delacour From Harry Potter," This is the more ""human"" step. Fleur Delacour is French, so this is the most necessary step.""Slip"" in French/English words in your sentences. Also read up on France as it is today, so you know a little about the background, but you're not writing a research paper! If you can, try learning a bit of French in school or read a book on how to learn the language. Don't actually talk in a French accent, besides what you've read, because it can make you look like a poser, something Fleur is not.;
, Fleur is gorgeous and would never have a zit. If anything, try to put on some concealer. If it's huge, yellow, and filled with ick, get it treated as soon as possible.

, No giddiness or foolishness, or you will quickly be identified as a poser. Be proud of your culture. Walk with your head up high, but not too high as to seem obnoxious.

,, These types of schools generally try to make you more disciplined.

, Try nice pants, wear blue for Beauxbatons, a skirt (or dark-wash jeans if this step is too formal), and a polo, an oxford, a sweater, etc. with either clean sneakers (not tennis shoes, but the sneakers that are a little more classy) or nice flip flops, short heels, boots, etc., Fleur has silvery-blonde hair. If you are trying to act like her, then dye it platinum blonde from a box, or get it done. At the least, get honey highlights if your hair is brown. If you don't want to dye your hair, then you don't have to.

, But, anything that isn't blonde will not be classified as Fleur.

, When someone asks you a question, using the example, ""What did you do today?"" do NOT say nothing. But, do not answer with a geeky Harry Potter answer either (""I learned a rather charming spell today!""). Instead, smile politely and say more of, ""I had a simply delightful French dinner and read up on my history."" Be outspoken and opinionated, but extremely romantic and girly.

, Pamper her with trips to the mall, get your nails done together, or just read a book to her (if she's young). Make sure she loves you, and would tell you everything about her life, as if you were one of her really good friends.

, When Fleur gets older, she marries Bill, but since most likely you are too young to get married, get a boyfriend (does not have to be the ""hottest guy at school"") and be extremely devoted to him (according to age). Always talk to him like a friend. This is not necessary, though. If you don't fancy boys, don't force yourself to get one.

, Fleur fights grindylows and escapes, survives torture, and eventually fights in a major battle. If you really want to be like Fleur, you'll need to learn to kick some butt.

, As it says in the books, Fleur, along with her other students sat at the Ravenclaw table, read up on how to be one of them as well, if you're not already. Being smart doesn't hurt you know.

",How to Act Like a Hogwarts Student," Harry and Ron always break the rules, but Hermione used to be really sensitive about doing so.What you need to do in most cases is find out what the majority of Hogwarts does. In this case, they have not got a problem with breaking the rules, but don't do it too often.;
, Take online sorting quizzes, but make sure to add your opinion. Do you wish that you are not in Slytherin? Do you absolutely detest Ravenclaws? Are Hufflepuffs too annoying? Are Gryffindors too stubborn and narrow minded? Consider your house carefully and choose.

,


What house are you in? What's your patronus? Figure it out by taking quizzes on these topics or just choose. Once you've figure out your house, try to brush up on the house's traits. For example, if you're in Gryffindor and you want to be more brave, take a risk, or be more friendly! If you are a Slytherin, put hard work into everything! Don't do anything you don't want to though!

, The Hogwarts students are very fun, brave, and adventurous, but down to earth at the same time. Go to unique places, try new things, and just have fun! Don't jump off a cliff, but maybe try a new, spicy food.Try it and you will learn to love it!

, Voldemort thinks he is above having friends, but he is a cruel person! Spend time with your friends, and don't betray them! If you do it would be very un-Hogwartsish and not nice either.

, These are the common hobbies at Hogwarts. Spell Battles might sound lame, but it honestly is fun when you duel with a friend for fun, or you could try the pottermore version. Some muggle hobbies wizards do are read, paint, play an instrument , bake, play outside, do crafts, goof off with friends, knit, etc.

, Hogwarts students usually dress comfy. If you're a girl, just dress classic. Think button downs, sweaters, blouses, cardigans, oxfords, scarf's, vintage jewelry, etc. Not too much makeup though. Just keep it natural. Since Hogwarts is chilly, they usually wear jumpers, jackets, coats, sweaters and so forth. This is optional, since this is not a part of your personality. Just be yourself.

, Think rustic and old fashioned pieces of furniture. Put up house pride banners, organize it nicely, have a wooden trunk, and put up some Harry Potter Merchandise. If possible, have a four poster bed, coloured with your house colours.

, Who doesn't want to eat like a Hogwarts Student? Buy the Unofficial Harry Potter Cookbook and cook up some food! There's recipes from Pot Roast, to Knickerbocker Glory. You can search online for chocolate frogs, all flavour beans, etc. There are multiple recipes online for butterbeer you can Google.

, Playing Quidditch is a hobby of almost all Hogwarts students, and there is no reason to avoid it. Don't get upset if you lose, but try harder!

So smile, and let others do the same.;
, The Weasleys were known for flaming red hair. If you have blonde hair, you can leave it. However, it makes you a true Weasley if you have their hair. Dye your hair, or even wear a wig.

Get your own signature scent.,
Get very pale skin (optional).",How to Look Like Bella Cullen from Breaking Dawn Part 11," One of the first things that Edward notices about Bella is her tasty smell; apparently she smells very 'sweet'. Take some time to find a perfume that you like so you can smell nice too. Don't apply too much at once - you don't want it to be overpowering. Make sure you smell good by using deodorant as well as perfume.

, In Breaking Dawn Part 1, it is vital that Bella looks even paler than usual as she is turning into a vampire. You don't have to have pale skin to act like Bella, but if you do want to have pale skin, there are a few different ways to do so.


Use sunscreen with a high SPF. When you're outside, especially in the summer, use sunscreen with a high SPF (45 or higher) to keep your skin pale. Avoid tanning or lying in the sun for a long time.
Use a foundation that isn't any darker than your natural skin-tone
One night a week, take a bath with 2 cups of milk in it. Then put 1/3 cups of baking soda in the bath. Bathe for 30 minutes - 1 hour. It will make your skin paler.
Use skin lightening cream.

"
"
Prep your skin.,
Apply primer (optional).,
Put concealer over any blemishes and under the eyes to make you look fresh and awake, like Bella.,
Apply foundation.,
Use highlighter; this will give a really nice effect.,
Apply small amounts of powder.,
Apply the mascara of your choice.,
Apply the eyebrow pen, filling in your eyebrows where needed.,
Finish with natural lip-balm (optional).",How to Look Like Bella Cullen from Breaking Dawn Part 12," Washing your face with water, then apply a little moisturizer all over your face and let it sink in. Don't apply too much as it won't ever sink in and you can't put make-up over the top.;
, Primer gives your makeup a smooth surface to glide over, but it isn't necessary. If you want to use it, apply it like the moisturizer - all over the face. Leave this for a minute and make sure that your skin is only a little dewy before continuing to apply more makeup.

, You may also want to put it around the nostrils and in the corner of your eyes. Make sure that the concealer matches your skin tone.

, You can apply this with a foundation brush, a makeup sponge, or with your hands. Using a foundation brush is recommended as it gives an even finish. Apply all over the face and make sure that it is blended in (so it doesn't look streaky). Again, the foundation should be the same colour as your skin tone.

, Applied on brow bones, eyelids and cheeks most commonly, it will make you look pale and elegant, like Bella.

, Take a powder brush and put a little on it. Get a paper towel and tap the excess powder off of the brush before you sweep it around the face. Only use in places where it's too shiny as we still want a bit of a natural dewy effect to look like Bella. Be sure to apply a little over the eyelids to make them nude, clear and matte.

, Use sweeping movements up to lengthen and curl your lashes. Dark brown or black mascara is preferred.

, Work with the direction of the hair to make it look as natural as possible. Make sure to choose a colour that is as close as possible to the colour of your eyebrows.

, Go for a neutral coloured lip balm such as light pink, or nude for daytime. Go for slightly darker colours for night like berry colours. Finish with some clear gloss over top.

"
"
Shirts.,
Pants.,
Shoes.,
Dresses.",How to Look Like Bella Cullen from Breaking Dawn Part 13," Bella is known for her checked shirts and plaid shirts, so buy a few that you like. You can get them in many colours and sizes and they suit anyone and everyone. Bella also wears simple, long-sleeved shirts in dark colours like blue, grey, brown and sometimes even green.

, Jeans are what she always wears, because Bella's style is so comfortable and laid-back. Buy a few different pairs of jeans that fit perfectly. Buy some jeans in different washes for variety.

, Bella loves easy-to-wear, comfortable shoes such as Converse, Keds and other ""sneaker""-style shoes. She usually wears them in solid, dark colours such as black, grey, and navy blue.

, Although Bella is more of a tomboy with her clothing, she gets more feminine as the series progresses. In Breaking Dawn Part 1, she certainly looks more elegant in what she wears. She wears sophisticated dresses such as the one pictured above. Consider buying a simple dress that will suit your figure and fit you well. Because Bella doesn't wear bright colours, opt for a dress in ivory/white, black, or navy blue.

"
"
Consider dying your hair.,
Use electric styling products to get loose waves.,
Get loose waves yourself.,
Finish it off.",How to Look Like Bella Cullen from Breaking Dawn Part 14," In the films Kristen Stewart (who plays Bella) has long dark brown hair. If dark brown is not your natural hair colour, consider you could try to dye your hair so you look more like Bella, but it is optional.

, The easiest way to achieve Bella's signature ""loose waves"" hairstyle is by straightening completely dry hair with a straightening iron (if it's not already straight), and then taking sections of your hair and using a curling iron to achieve these loose waves. Remember to put a heat protectant spray or cream in your hair before using electrical styling products - this protects your hair from the damage that the heat from the styling products gives off.

, If you cannot afford any electrical hair styling items, you can do achieve the ""loose waves"" look naturally. Wash your hair, then towel-dry it. When it's only a little damp, put it in a French braid/french plaits. If you don't know how to do this, take large sections of your hair and braid them normally. Leave it in for a few hours and when take it out of the plait/braid, you will have beautiful wavy locks. They also sell twilight hair brushes to get her exact curls/waves. It's a big round brush, get one! They are very cheap. You can find them in Walmart, etc.

, Bella's hair is polished; there are no fly-aways on her head. After styling your hair, apply a bit of de-frizz-er to your hair to keep fly-aways in place, and then spray a little bit of hairspray in your hair to hold the waves in place.

"
"
Go to the beauty salon, and dye your hair golden blonde, or a light blonde.,
Make sure you clean your face with soap, or some kind of cleanser every day.

,
Go and get a foundation that's actually a 1-2 shades lighter then your skin tone.,
Go out and buy some contacts.,
Get some Kohl eyeliner, make sure it's the solid liner, and not liquid that you put on your bottom lids.,
Get some blood red lipstick, and apply it on your lips.

,
Wear shirts that show some cleavage and that are in style.,
Get some purple eye shadow and rub it underneath your eyes to get the no-sleep look.,
Rosalie always wears the family crest necklace.,
Be super skinny.",How to Look and Act Like Rosalie Hale1," In the books, her hair is golden blonde. This is only if you actually want to look like Rosalie, not Nikki Reed. If your hair is any blonde but dirty blonde, don't get it dyed. If it's dirty blonde, use John Frieda Blonde Go Blonder shampoo and conditioner, and the lightening spray.


Take some bobby pins, and pull the longest parts of your hair up, and pin them to your head. Straighten, or curl the bottom part. When that's all done, take the bobby pins down, then pull the very longest part up again, and get the part under it. When that's done, do the top part, then pull half of your hair back.
Another look is to just put it in long, wavy curls, as this is Rosalie's normal style.
On I think October 1st, they're releasing Twilight hair products. There's a Rosalie brush to get her waves, and hot curls to get her curls. Buy them.;
,, Make sure when you apply it, you rub it in, and it looks natural. Next, get powder that is the same color, and apply it with a brush, not the pad that comes with it. Then, if you want to get the ""just fed"" look, get the lightest shade they have in blush, and apply it on the on your upper cheeks.

, If you don't need contacts, you can purchase a pair that only change your eye color and don't change your vision. Choose either gold or black contacts. You can even get both, so that gold means you just fed, and black means you haven't fed in a while.

, Apply it under your eye lashes, and then on top. Make this in an even line. Then get some Liquid eye liner, and put it on your top lids. Start in the middle, with a thin line, and then bring it all the way out to the corner of your eyes. But make this look natural. Then fill in the line in the corner of your eyes. If you aren't good at putting it on your top lids, or you just want a more natural look, put a little more than usual on your bottom lids and squeeze your eyes shut. This will make the eyeliner go on your top eyelids too and it won't look so dark on top. Take an eyelash curler, and curl your eyelashes BEFORE you apply mascara, or you will rip your lashes out. Then apply as much mascara as you can to your top lashes, but none to the bottom ones. It looks much better and more ""perfect"" when there is no clumps so either smooth it out while it's still wet, or buy a non-clump mascara. Also, buy a mascara that really volumizes each lash.

,, Buy pants that are dark, and tight. Wear high-heel shoes with skinny jeans, that looks hot. Rosalie tends to wear white jackets and dark pants, so try to get that look. Some of the things that Rose wears are (simple) designer clothes, but if you can't afford the kind that she wears, just get look-a-likes.

, Make sure it has no sparkles on it! Then apply a cranberry or plum color to your eyes.

, You can find her necklace online.

, Don't stop eating and starve yourself. Just lose weight if you need to. In the books, Rose looked skinnier than anybody else, so you should shoot for that (but do not starve yourself).

Always walk with your chin held high, and your chest out.,
Always talk, no one wants a loner.,
Act popular, even if you're not.,
When people start to bleed, don't spend one more minute in there, flee the room.,
Be proud of yourself, as Rose is proud of herself.,
Always look like you're watching people's necks, and look like you're restraining yourself so you won't jump at them.

,
When you get to play sports (especially baseball) don't look clumsy or weak, always look strong and fast.,
Hide your feelings.,
Use eye contact.",How to Look and Act Like Rosalie Hale2," Walk with elegance, and act like you know it all. And very importantly, walk gracefully - like a MODEL. Models walk with their chin up, back straight, and one foot lands in front of the other (not baby steps). That's how you should walk. To walk gracefully, sort of roll up from your heel to the bottom of your foot. Glance in mirrors at least 20 times a day. And when you do, stare at your self in the mirror, and occasionally smile at yourself, and tell yourself how beautiful you are. Even speak it out loud, Rosalie never held anything back. Be shallow, but not too shallow that you end up without any friends. But make people want to be like you. Wave at people you don't even know. Flirt with guys, and soon they will be following you like puppies.

, But don't talk too much or be loud or annoying, because that's not like Rosalie.

, You can be popular in some peoples eyes. And be an idol: don't cuss and don't bag on people behind their backs. Be nice, but mean if they mess with your family., And if people ask you why you have circles underneath your eyes say ""none of your business."" and walk away.

, But don't be too stuck-up and talk in a rich-kid voice. When your best friend gets hurt or they are going through a crisis, hold them tight, while acting like you're holding your breath, and cry with her.

,, Every time you run or something, do it with all of your strength. Look hot at the same time.

, If someone upsets you, pretend you don't care. If you are mad about someone, act like you are a little bit interested. Be believable. Don't complain and mutter about it.

, And when somebody talks to you, act like they broke your train of thought. Also, when you're talking, talk with dignity and as if everything you say is a fact. Be sure to never say something that's not true, because then you'll look like an idiot, and Rose isn't an idiot.

Have a unique style.,
Wear lots of accessories.,
Cut your hair, but only if you want to.,
Wear minimal makeup.,
Be healthy.",How to Look Like Alice Cullen (from Twilight)1," Alice was born around the turn of the century and grew up in the Victorian era, turning into a vampire in the early 1920s. She never really wears the same outfit(top, jacket or anything) twice and she is horrified at the thought of wearing anything ""off the rack"". She is very fashion-conscious. In the books, her style is a cross between punk and chic, with some vintage thrown in for good measure.Alice always keeps an eye on current trends, but she doesn't wear what anyone else would( as we take notice of in The Twilight Saga). But make sure to have your own style and stand out from the crowd. If you truly want the Alice look then sticking to shades of grey,black, purple or white would be a good idea. Alice loves to party and have fun, and she incorporates this funky flavor into her everyday style. In the movie, Alice's style could be described as modern-Victorian: vintage chic, a throwback to her 1920s human life. The Victorian era was all about the minor details, and the color palette consisted of understated, muted tones in rich fabrics. Wear ivory, black, grey, and navy, with lace, silk, or smooth cotton. Wear dark wash jeans in a trouser cut for a more conservative style, or go for her look in the movie with grey skinny jeans. Be sophisticated, yet young and sweet. For everyday, try Alice's knee-length dress with a cropped cardigan, leggings, and flats. For a party look, take her shiny red sequined tank-top (from the Eclipse graduation party) and pair it with tight black pants and high heels. Have fun with your clothes! If you are worried you won't be able to wear those bright clothes, don't be! You can always wear them underneath your dark clothes. Before going on a major shopping spree, look what you have in your wardrobe,. You will be amazed on how much Alice-styled clothes you have!;
, In the movie, Alice wears old-fashioned rings and metal bracelets/bangles. The rings that she wears are subtle, with gems that are not as flashy as a diamond. In the movie, she also wears the Cullen crest, the family's signature ""symbol,"" on a ribbon around her neck. This Twilight trinket is available on the Internet, along with other jewelry pieces from Alice's wardrobe. You might be able to find look-a-likes (or the real thing!) at Boxwish. This site is also useful for finding other pieces from Alice's wardrobe.

, Alice has short, spiked, ""pixie-like"" hair. It's one of her most outstanding features, and is therefore important. You need black hair, or in the least, dark brown. You could consider dying if you want to, but you don't have to; you could just cut it. Go to your hair cutter and bring a picture of her with her spiky hair and ask them if they will cut it and do it like that for you. Pay a bunch of attention when she's styling it; you will need to know how to do this. Also, you'll need to buy good hairspray and a flat iron.

, Use light colored foundation to achieve the paleness of all Twilight vampires. Use a shade lighter than your natural skin tone if you aren't already pale. Sweep a purple or light black shadow under your eyes to get the ""recovering from a broken nose, need to feed"" look. Topaz-colored or golden contacts are an option for those with the money and desire to attain the ""well-fed vegetarian"" look. To help with the pale look, cover up with clothes or sunscreen, or stay out of the sun completely. Take care of your skin. Use moisturizer, keep out of the sun (for paleness and for health reasons), and take care of pimples and breakouts by having a skin-care routine and eating the right foods.

, Since you're not a vampire (yet), eat the right foods! Take care of your body, and don't go for crash diets. Everybody hates diets, but these are the worst! They mess up your body and make it hard for you to stay healthy afterward. Opt instead for balance, and if you really need to lose weight, just eat less and exercise more. Get plenty of rest, drink lots of water, and incorporate some fun exercise into your routine. Try ballet (for Alice's graceful movements) or a more contemporary dance. Karate, running, bicycling, or even baseball (!!) and other sports are great ways to get moving! Why not get a group of friends together for some vampire baseball action?

Alice is bubbly, lively, witty, and very optimistic.,
Be graceful.,
Be funny!,
Be nice!,
Walk fast.,
Look like a nice person (vampire).",How to Look Like Alice Cullen (from Twilight)2," Be positive and cheerful, a friend to everyone. Alice looks on the bright side of things, and always thinks the best of her family and friends.

, She has a very graceful ""prance"" or skip and her run is described like a gazelle's run. Try ballet lessons to become more graceful--and after all, Alice's movements are like a dancer's--or simply try not to channel Bella when you walk.

, Alice is considered very sarcastic and funny. With her quotes: "" Stop worrying Bella, you're going to go prematurely grey,"" ""I think she is going into hysterics, maybe you should slap her!"" and ""It sounded like you were having Bella for lunch, so we came to see if you would share,"" Alice is known for her quirky sense of humor. However, she has tact and knows when to be serious.

, Alice is never mean! She is kind and sweet to everybody, except when they mess with her family! Always smile when people are talking. But when they are talking about something serious, listen, very carefully, and then they will want to be around you.

, But don't overdo it. If you walk too fast you'll most likely fall over, so walk in a decent speed, but faster than usual.

, Always smile. Don't make it look too obvious and make it look like a vampire.

Keep yourself warm.,
Make up.,
She has long eyelashes, just like her dad.,
Contacts.,
Be healthy.,
Personality.,
Be lovely with your friends, even giving them a soft kiss on the cheekbone reminds a lot of Renesmee's attitude.

,
Don't judge others nor laugh at bad things your friends might say about the ""freak"" of the school.,
Be intelligent.,
Never get tired of new things.,
Be selfless.,
Have a particular smell.,
Be protective over someone.",How to Look Like Renesmee Cullen," Go to the hairdresser and choose the bronze color that mostly fits you. Then buy an iron to curl it. This is not very necessary.;
, Renesmee has pale skin, which has a blush to it because her heart pumps blood (though it beats faster than a normal human heart). Buy a foundation 1 or 2 tones lighter than your skin color and then a soft pinkie blush which you'll be slightly adding to your cheekbones with a big brush.

, This might be tricky in winter, when anyone else will be shaking because of the cold. Never say you're cold, cause Renesmee's temperature seems to be unusually warm, only a few degrees below that of a werewolf. Clothing with many warm layers will help you.

, Her skin is as tough as a vampire's, so as perfect flawless.Due to the blood flowing in her veins and her heart beating, she has red rosy cheeks, shell-pink lips, and pale lavender eyelids.To achieve that look, always apply a moisturizing cream every morning. This will help you protect from the sunlight, too.Then mix a lavender eye shadow with a brown one, blending 'til you'll get a good and not too marked smokey eyes effect.

, Spend some money on a good mascara, and apply fake lashes if needed.For the final touch, wear a shell pink lipstick with a light blush.

, Renesmee has chocolate brown eyes, just like her mother Bella when she was human. Buy contacts if you're eyes are any other color. Golden ones will be good too, to remind the Cullen's lifestyle.

, Renesmee's figure is described to be quite thin. As Charlie says when he meets her one day. Go on a HEALTHY diet and practice in a gym, a lot. Basically follow a correct lifestyle.

, Renesmee is depicted as a kind, overwhelmingly intelligent, and fun-loving child. She has a competitive streak that prompts her to accept Jacob's hunting challenges, which keeps her motivated to drink animal blood.Never be gross when you speak, as she's described to be educated and intelligent. Just like Edward. At school, always respect your teacher and this will help with your marks.

,, You will stand out and remind a lot Bella's ways of doing

, Don't focus on silly stuff, like nonsense gossip. Be aware of what's going on around, and try to be as much informed about everything as possible. Learn things quickly. Remember Bella describes Renesmee as more intelligent than most of adults, and has better control (on thirst) than the rest of them.

, Just like every kid she likes to read books and listen to music, something she shares with her parents. She likes to hear Bella reading bedtime stories, but hates hearing the same ones twice, expecting therefore to hear new ones.

, Renesmee for example blamed herself for causing trouble to her family merely by existing, or when she takes Kate's advice to help her mother, despite Bella's protests.

, Renesmee's scent in a mix between a vampire's and a human's. Buy particular and rare bath foam or mix two of them together, so that you'll get your own smell. Use it often.

, Like a male cousin or a friend. It will look like he's imprinted on you.

Get golden blonde hair.,
Make sure you clean your face with soap, or some kind of cleanser every day.,
Go and get a foundation that's actually a 1-2 shades lighter then your skin tone.,
Go out and buy some color contacts in either butterscotch, gold, or black.,
In an even line, apply solid Kohl eyeliner under and on top of your eyelashes.,
Apply blood red lipstick to your lips.

,
Wear shirts that show some cleavage, that are in style.,
Wear something like: Grey jeans, a light top and a dark jacket.",How to Cosplay Rosalie Hale," Her hair is golden blonde in the books, but it's more bleach blonde to light blonde in the movies. You can dye your hair golden blonde if it isn't already. Don't use an at home bleaching kit. It may ruin your hair, and you won't get the color you're looking for. If your hair is any shade of blonde though besides dirty blonde don't bother dying your hair.


Be sure to type your hair the right way. Take some bobby pins, and pull the longest parts of your hair up, and pin them to your hair. Straighten, or curl the bottom part. When that's all done, take the bobby pins down, then pull the very longest part up again, and get the part under it. When that's done, do the top part, then pull half of your hair back. If you don't have much time, just curl your hair in long, romantic locks, as this is Rosalie's normal hair-do.
On I think October 1st, a line of Twilight hair products are coming out. There is a Rosalie hairbrush to get her waves, and hot curls for her curls. Buy these. You can go online to instyle.com to find out more, as they have an exclusive sneak peek about it.;
, Rosalie has perfect skin, so keep it clean. Get a washcloth, wet it with warm water. Get some white sugar and some salt, and some soap. Pour the salt and sugar on the washcloth, then scrub your face every day with this. This works wonders. Do whatever you have to to make sure you don't have any blemishes.

, Rub it in as you apply it, so it looks natural. Next, use a brush to apply similarly-colored powder. To get the ""just fed"" look, apply the lightest shade of blush available to your upper cheeks.

, You can even get all three, so that yellow/gold means you just fed(animal), and black means you haven't fed in a while. If you don't have time to do this step, you can skip it.

, Next, put liquid eye liner on your top lids. Start in the middle, with a thin line, and then bring it all the way out to the corner of your eyes. But make this look natural. Then fill in the line in the corner of your eyes. Take an eyelash curler, and curl your eyelashes BEFORE you apply mascara, or you will rip your lashes out. Then apply as much mascara as you can to your top lashes, but none to the bottom ones. Get a good mascara that volumizes every lash.

,, And pants that are dark, and tight. Wear high-heel shoes with skinny jeans, that looks hot.

, Or black jeans; a white/light Grey top and a light or dark jacket. NEVER WEAR LIGHT JEANS/PANTS AND DARK TOP; it doesn't have a Rosalie style. Great colors to wear are cream, navy, brown, grey, or black as long as you're not very tan. Wear muted, understated colors in your clothes, but throwing in bright red or blue stilettos doesn't hurt. And save up your money for designer brands in stuff like jackets, designer jeans, big name brand shoes, and name brand purses. This makes you look rich- The Cullens are rich.

Dress like Bella.,
Consider her outfits in the books.,
Remember her outfits from the movies:


dark, long-sleeved tee shirts
jeans
black-and-white Keds
boots
green dress

,
Think of Bella's overall style.,
Dye your hair dark brown(chocolate color) if you want, but you if you don't feel comfortable with it, then don't do it.,
Style your hair like Bella's.,
Also in the movies, she wears a lot of thin headbands.

,
Do your makeup like Bella's.,
Get brown contacts if your eyes aren't brown or at least dark.

,
Keep your skin it's natural color.,
Bella goes for plain clothes that are dark colours, she doesn't wear frilly dresses her style is boy-ish but with little pieces of jewelry she makes it look more feminine.

",How to Dress Like Bella Swan," Don't be overly fancy. Bella almost always wears long sleeves because she lives in Washington. If you live in a hot area like California, Texas, etc., dress comfortably for you. Wear short sleeves that blend in with a crowd, so you aren't the center of attention. Bella is not known to get dressed up everyday(remember, Bella only has one skirt). She is, however, known for wearing comfortable, practical clothing. She mostly wears dark colors such as black, navy, dark green, grey, brown, and sometimes white. Navy blue would be a good pick because blue is Bella's favourite colour and Edward mentions several times that Bella looks very pretty in blue.;
, In the books, Bella wears the following items:


white eyelet lace shirt
plain black jacket
navy jacket
jeans
boots
beige turtleneck sweater
khaki skirt
And then, of course, her infamous prom outfit: a frilly blue off the shoulder dress (with french tags that Alice put her in), flowers from Edward in her hair and 1 stiletto held on by satin ribbons and a cast with walking boot on the other foot.

,, Her look would probably be classified as preppy and tomboyish. She wear stripes, she loves plaid, she wear her hair loosely curled, and she wears skinny jeans. She often dresses in a tomboyish style, but she does occasionally wear pretty, girly dresses. Bella likes comfortable shoes and didn't enjoy it when Alice made her wear stilettos to prom.

, You don't have to be an exact duplicate unless you want to. If you have black hair, that will work fine as well.

, Bella is very natural. She just brushes her hair and she's done, except for on special occasions. There's three ways you can be like Bella Swan in this category; a middle part or sideswept bangs is best for all three looks.


Keep it natural. Just brush through it and you're done.
Wear your hair in loose waves like she does in the movie. There are all sorts of ways to do this. You can put your hair in buns after you shower, curl your hair with a pencil, and then run your fingers through it. You can also use a large barreled curling iron. Choose whichever one works best for your hair. Also, you can put a headband in it like she does in the movie, or simply put in hair clips.


Straighten your hair. Stephenie Meyer actually pictures Bella with straight hair(mentioned on her website), But whatever looks best and what you want with your hair is what you should do with it.

,, In the book, Bella doesn't wear makeup. In the movie, she wears very natural makeup like foundation, brown eyeshadow on the lids, and pink lipstick. You can choose which you want to do. If you like the look in the movie, check out this and similar YouTube videos.

,, Bella doesn't worry about becoming more tan. If you have the potential to have pale skin wear lots of sunscreen when outside, it will keep you pale and keep your skin healthy. If you like your skin colour, you don't have to.

Consider dying your hair.,
Work on lightening your skin: Paleness is key.,
Wear the right makeup: Foundation that is the powder kind is probably best.,
Put some thought into getting the right clothes: The wardrobe is very important.,
Rosalie is very rich, like all of the Cullens, so get a job.",How to Re Create Rosalie Hale's Look from Twilight,": If you don't already have blond hair, now would be the time to get it! If you're absolutely sure you want to recreate the look of Rosalie, then you will need to go to a salon and dye your hair golden blond or any shade of blond is fine. In the books, she is pretty famous for her beautiful ""golden hair"", so I would do golden. Make sure this color will look good on you first please. If your hair is already any shade of blonde don't mess with it unless it's dirty blonde. If that happens use John Frieda Blonde Go Blonder shampoo and conditioner, and lightening spray.


You will need to have loose, soft, romantic waves that make you look like you stepped out of a salon that very morning.
Also, get layers in your hair. If you wear your hair down, part your hair in the middle. If you need a style to brush it up into, I would suggest the half up half down look.
Sweep each side of your hair up and also the crown or middle of your hair where your part would be. Secure with bobby pins that blend in with your hair color or an intricate, old fashioned style metal large clip.;
, If you are already pale that is wonderful and continue to wear sunscreen when outdoors so you don't risk tanning or burning. If you're not as pale as you could be, wear a foundation that 1-2 shade lighter than your real skin tone depending on how dark your skin tone is. A good way to look and be paler is to soak in a bath (no bubbles) with a relaxation soap which loosens and softens your skin, then pour in 2 glasses of milk and stay in a further 10 minutes. This should make your skin tone a bit lighter. (DO NOT MAKE YOURSELF CHALK WHITE, this would make you look ill.) And flawless skin is important, did you ever see Rosalie with a pimple? In the mornings wash your face and neck with water and gently pat dry, the rub in small amounts of moisturizer on your face and neck (up and outward motions)it will make your skin smooth and help reduce spots.

, You will look weirder if you use the liquid foundation because it's kind of like a mask. Blood red lipstick will make all the boys stare. A quick swipe of gloss over the lipstick is perfect for parties and formal events.However light pink lipstick will look good for a chilled day. Curl your eyelashes BEFORE you apply your mascara or you will rip out your eyelashes. Then, apply 2 to 4 coats of mascara to your top lashes and just one to your bottom lashes. Eyeliner should always be black and applied to your lower lids just above your lashes and then underneath your lashes from the center of your pupil out to the corner of your eye making slight wings out the sides but don't make them too big. Then, squeeze your eyes shut to make the eyeliner go onto your upper lids too. Then, you must reapply one coat of eyeliner after that.

, The time Rosalie grew up in was the Victorian era which had very muted and understated colors in rich fabrics like silk, velvet, cotton, etc. There was lots of lace. Rosalie typically wears dark wash skinny or boot jeans with a blazer, sky-high heels, and of course, her Cullen crest necklace. You can get this necklace anywhere online. Rosalie also wore a white scarf just draped over the shoulders of her blazer in Twilight the movie. She wears something simple always with her signature necklace and in New Moon at Bella's birthday party she wore a flattering solid black dress with a chunky bracelet. Earrings are a must and must always make a statement. Be sure your wardrobe includes the following colors: ivory, cream, navy, purple, black, and gray.

, The oldest is really 12 because then you can babysit, but go for high-paying jobs. Then use the money to make you look more rich by buying expensive clothes and such. However you don't need to much money to get her style! Go searching in Charity shops (they have great bargains) or you and your friends could have an old clothes swap where you gather your old clothe and go through each others.

Don't be materialistic.",How to Act Like Bella from Twilight," Bella doesn't have a very high self esteem, but she still has the confidence to stick up for herself and what she believes in. But beware, you may end up with consequences like near death from pregnancy! She's often described as stubborn, especially by Edward.;
, If you want to truly act like Bella, this is actually pretty important. Don't fall or break things on purpose, of course. But if you do fall or trip, shake it off and don't worry about it. Bella is also described of being extremely non-athletic, which sort of ties in with the clumsiness.

, Bella is physically beautiful, but she never spends time on her looks. She always wears jeans and t-shirts in muted or neutral colors, and sneakers. You could try Converse or flats as well. Bella has long, dark brown hair. Stephanie Meyer has said that she pictured Bella with straight hair, but in the movie she has wavy hair. Either one is fine, but sticking with your natural hair would be best. Wear a headband or small clips to keep your hair away from your face. Makeup is a no-no, but if you do wear it, it should be kept natural. Foundation, lip balm and maybe a little mascara is enough. Keep the look fresh and clean. Effortless beauty is key. Bella is beautiful naturally and so are you.


Bella has pretty pale skin. This really is not essential, especially if you have a darker skin tone, but always remember to wash your face in the morning and at night and wear sunscreen. The sunscreen won't only help keep a paler complexion, but it will also protect from skin cancer and signs of aging from the sun.






Bella has a habit of biting her lower lip.







, Bella is very shy and introverted. She's a lone wolf who hates attention and blending in with the crowd. If you are outgoing, however, you should not attempt to stifle such antics, and realize that it is folly to ever try to be anything that you are not.


Bella is a softly spoken girl, don't be loud while talking to people.







, Bella is very curious, loving, headstrong, sometimes sarcastic, persistent with meaningful things (not materialistic items), and only scared of things that she thinks will hurt her loved ones/ family (when she met him she believed Edward had the strength not to hurt her).

, Bella is an excellent student because she works very hard. It's mentioned in the books that she was in AP classes back in Phoenix. Study hard and do your homework.


Bella is dumb, but tries her best at school. She doesn't do very well, though she also enjoys reading school books and doesn't have other interests!







, Bella helps Charlie often, even when she isn't asked. Just keep your room clean or offer to wash the dishes after dinner. She also cooks dinner every night since Charlie is pretty much incapable of cooking an edible meal.

, It's Jane Austen, Shakespeare, Chaucer, and Faulkner. All authors were on Bella's reading mentioned in the books that Bella likes to read and reads quite often. Try reading Wuthering Heights or Anne and the Green Gables. Both are great classics, not to mention reading makes you a lot smarter.

, Bella is not wildly popular in Phoenix or in Forks, but she does have a few good and trusting friends like Alice, Jacob, Eric, Angela, Mike, and Jessica. Even though Bella is very reclusive, she does have a few good friends to talk to and spend time with.


Although Bella is shy, people still love her, but she hates to talk.







, Remember, Bella is a loner. She wasn't even interested in having a boyfriend until she met Edward. Be patient: eventually the right guy will come around.


Bella spends most of her time with the Cullens, with Edward, studying, listening to music or reading. But occasionally she does go out with her girlfriends and other friends to go shopping or to see a movie. Neglect any friends but also do the right thing!






Bella doesn't go out with a lot of guys, but she's a romantic who prefers to wait until true love comes along.







, Bella is always soft, gentle, reticent, peaceful, and diffident unless someone is mean to her or her loved ones. She also stares a lot sometimes. She comes across as shy but when she slowly gets to know you she loosens up and becomes less shy. Bella isn't outgoing, doesn't like being center of attention and would rather be unknown (she doesn't like drawing attention to herself). She is also sarcastic when she opens up!

, Bella is fine with what she has and helps out around the house, does a lot of chores and everything without being asked. Seeing as her dad's a bad cook, she knows how to cook (ask your parents to teach you some basic meals).


Bella hates birthdays (because of aging) so she is ungrateful for her presents.

",How to Look Like a Cullen from Twilight," Don't try to look like a Cullen if you've never read the books. Also, watching the movies can help to give a some-what visual, but read the books, too. They tend to change things in the movies.;
, You should pick your character based on who you really look like. You should think about how long your hair is. If it's short, consider Alice and if your hair isn't black, you could dye it. If your hair is about shoulder length (and light brown or caramel), Esme is good. If your hair is longer and golden blonde to very blonde, go with Rosalie. If you're dirty blonde, use a lemon to lighten you hair some. If your hair is long and darker brown, be Bella. Remember that Alice's hair is short (pixie-cut), black, and spiky, Esme's is medium-length, wavy, and caramel, Rosalie's is also wavy, but longer and blonde, and Bella's is straight, long, and is mahogany in the books but dark brown in the movies.

, It's simple, but effective. Even in the dead of winter, use sunscreen.

, Unless you're very pale, get a foundation about two shades lighter than your skin tone. Then, apply a couple coats of mascara to your top lashes. Apply deep blue eyeshadow under your eyes, and a little plum-ish color on your eyelids. You want your eyes to stand out as a great feature, but don't want it to look like you applied a bunch of makeup. Next, apply lipstick. If you're going for Esme, wearing a pink lipstick or red is good. For Rosalie, blood red- don't get confused- just blood red. For Alice, nude, red, or orange works. For Bella, light pink or a clear lipgloss (she doesn't wear too much make-up). NO BLUSH.

, Exercise a lot to make sure you're skinny. Drink 8 glasses of water to give your skin a ""glow."" Eat healthy foods, too.

, Always make sure your hair looks perfect-no exceptions. If you're going for Alice, keep it in it's proper spikes with some hair spray. If you're with Rosalie, you need to keep it in long wavy curls-always; that means that if during a break or before lunch you have to sneak to the bathroom and re-curl with a curling iron, do it. Also, wash your face every morning and night, exfoliate 1-2 time a week, and use a face mask 1 time a week. Use lotion after you get out of the shower, wash your face, and before you go to bed. Shave. Make sure you're very strong and very fast. MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HAVE ACNE or pimples.

, Wear deodorant and shower every day so you smell great. Wear a beautiful perfume, but nothing too strong. To get the vampire smell wear a floral smell or a spicy smell.

, Get some contacts- either a butterscotch, gold, or black. Black means you need to be fed, butterscotch is just-fed, and gold is the ""didn't-just-drink-but-doing-perfectly-fine"" look. Don't get red contacts, because that is not a Cullen look AT ALL!

, They should have fabrics like lace or satin in them, and should look like they cost quite some cash. If you can't afford expensive clothes, buy clothes that look similar to wealthier fabrics. If you're trying to look like Alice, wear flats; If you're trying to look like Rosalie, wear stilettos. Wear muted colors like cream, white, navy, ivory, grey, and brown. If you're already pretty pale, wearing black can make you look paler.

, Brush your teeth AT LEAST twice a day, floss, use mouthwash, and take mints very often so your breath smells like heaven. Use either Whitening Strips or get your teeth whitened.

Be afraid of commitment.,
Keep yourself looking in top condition.,
Be a bit of a prankster.,
Be managerial.,
Watch movies a lot.,
Be loyal and caring.",How to Be Like Tony Dinozzo from NCIS," You could pick up a few traits to incorporate into your own actions.;
, Tony is over-confident. Basically think very highly of yourself. Don't go over the top though and start acting as if you are better than everyone else though.

, Tony has no reservations about flirting with women he finds attractive. This sometimes gets him in trouble on the job. Flirt with everyone but tone it down at work.

, Tony has only officially been 'in love' once, and it was a result of an assignment. Tony is very afraid of commitment and doesn't think love's a good idea. Tony isn't as emotionless as Ziva and Gibbs but he doesn't like emotions like love.


Never get too serious with anyone. Play the field. Realize that doing this will make people angry and will cause you to live a half life.

, Tony is super fit, and he wears clothes that complement his body. He's usually casual, in a t-shirt and jeans, or slacks. He keeps his hair healthy and cropped short.


Watch all the seasons of NCIS to pick your favorite Tony look, and take your inspiration from that.

, Tony loves pulling pranks. Think of pranks and even write them down if you have too. Then use them! Don't, however, overstep your mark. Tony wouldn't prank someone higher up than him.

, Make sure everyone knows you think you're in charge. This doesn't mean that you suddenly become the boss of everyone, it simply means that you portray the image of someone who is willing to take on someone's duty if they fail at it.

, Tony loves movies. Watch lots of movies and learn lots of movie references. Then use them. All the time!


Tony likes quoting movies with everyday things, not to mention often finding similar situations with them. Though it's great hobby, it might be difficult to take up if you have a busy schedule, or if you can't afford to watch movies.

, Tony may be annoying and he may pull pranks on everyone but he still has a good heart. He still cares about his team and shows this in certain episodes.

It's all about the hair.,
Accessorize!,
Be girly.,
Shoes.,
Make-up.,
Act like a celebrity.,
Have good people around you.,
Be classy.",How to Be Like the Girls from the Hills," How your hair looks is very important. Don't wear it messy. Straight and neat looks best. Although Lauren, Heidi and Whitney have blonde hair, don't go crazy over it and dye your hair blonde. Lauren loves wearing her hair in a low ponytail, with it curled, and pulled to the side to hang over her shoulder in the front. if you have short hair, extensions are always classy,but make sure they are the exact same colour as your hair, and that they aren't too long (if your hair is shoulder length, cut the extensions to be about as long to your elbow).;
, Wear cute accessories. They should match your outfits. Pearls or pearl earrings match everything, make sure they are cleaned and neat. Don't over accessorize, you'll look cheap. just a necklace and little diamond stud earrings, bangles are in right now, so wear a few (Chanel has them at Chanel.com).

, None of the girls have even the least bit of tomboy in them. Make sure to stand up straight, and never ever slouch. Stand firm and with grace. When you walk, be sure to graceful. When posing for a picture with friends or singly, place your hand on your waist, and stand tall. Smile, but not too big, or smile without showing teeth. SMILE a lot, and greet everyone with a hug, or if workers, shake hands. Be classy not trashy.

, Go buy some shoes! They don't have to be expensive, but they should look nice. Flats are in, and they probably will be for a while. Flats have been in since the 60's, and will probably will never go out of style. Be bold with the colors, silver and white ones, plenty of black ones. Keep them clean, and stop wearing them when they start wearing down. Flip flops are a good choice as well but not the chunky ones, those are cheap and not classy. Also, high heels are always good. Stilettos are the most chosen style, albeit, potentially more uncomfortable.

, This one is optional, because there's no point in caking on make-up just to look like someone else. If you're going to wear it, don't wear too much. Bare minerals is the BEST choice for makeup. You should always wear this everyday, it's even safe to sleep in. Then wear a little mascara, and bronzer, nothing too fake, just enough to give you that California glow.

, Well, these girls are considered celebrities. It will make you feel good about yourself, and other people will see it too. Act like everyone is important to you. Dress well wherever you go. Make sure you don't gossip about people UNLESS it's positive. Maintain a positive image, and people will think you are classy, and sweet.

, When you have good people around you, it is easier to deal with things. If this means opening up to people, go for it. Choose one or two of your closest friends, you don't need 100 friends that will end up hurting you and gossiping, just a few.

, This one is very important. You should look AND act classy and sophisticated. That's about it.

, Tori always sports a beachy, effortless look. If you're pale, sweep on some bronzer. Wear a tiny bit of blush, eyeliner, curled lashes with 1-2 coats of mascara, and gloss. If your skin is in a bad condition, feel free to reach for a concealer/foundation.

Don't mess up.",How to Act Like Rosalie Hale," You MUST get the best grades in the class. Always turn in homework- no exceptions. If you're sick and have a sibling, make them turn in your homework. This will really impress. Study a bunch, because you have to ace everything. If there is somebody who gets better grades than you, find out what they do to be so great. Create your own study plan, and balance out school and sports/activities, because ""I didn't have time"" is no excuse, as vampires have all night to do homework, and are also very quick at everything they do. Your teachers have to like you, so you need to be very nice to them. Also, pay attention in class, because if the teacher calls on you, you must perfectly have the answer. Raise your hand in class for almost everything, but not too much, or your teacher will get annoyed, and never volunteer to answer unless you're 100% positive you have the correct answer). However, don't volunteer after school for stuff, as Rose would never waste her time at school-she's had enough of it in her near-100 years of existence.;
, She's not very talkative, so you need to adjust to not talking much. Also, when people talk to you, talk with dignity and make eye-contact. Improve your vocabulary- constantly learn new words. Pronounce everything perfectly, and don't use slang words. Don't say ""dang"" and ""what the fudge"" either. DO NOT CUSS- this would've been considered horrid for when she was growing up.

, You need to have your own small group of friends with whom you share more than you do with others (but not too much, as close or not, Rose doesn't get too personal). However, make sure everybody admires you and would welcome you. You just have to be popular to be Rose.

, Don't bring a water bottle to school. Do not eat when anybody's watching, and don't eat everything on your tray, as people will notice that you ate then. Don't pack a lunch, because this shows you're eating.

, When you go to sleepovers, don't fall asleep until everyone else is. Also, set your watch-alarm (sorry, you'll have to get one, or some device that wakes you up besides an alarm clock) to wake you up early- way earlier before anybody else, so you can get perfectly ready. Bring a curling-iron so you can do your wavy, romantic, Rosalie-curls (because of course you do that.) Take a shower a couple hours before you go to the sleepover, so you won't have to take one there or in the morning (vampires don't shower, & you'd wake people up if you showered in the morning). Bring your makeup and do it, and brush your teeth before people wake up. Also, wash your face, apply deodorant, perfume, and lotion, too, so you'll look fresh. When everybody wakes up, you'll just be smiling with clean teeth, perfect hair, and clothes on. You'll look like you never slept. Also, it adds affect if you're just sitting up on your sleeping bag when people wake up, so it looks like you've been sitting there all night. Also, when you wake up (before you brush your teeth), eat like a granola bar you packed, so when breakfast is served, you can do what you do at lunch. If they ask, say you're ""not very hungry.""

, Even before and after gym. Also, look in a mirror at least 20 times a day, and every now and then when you're doing it, whisper ""I'm so beautiful"", or ""My hair looks wonderful"", or something like that, just loud enough for others to hear. You can also add something like ""as always"" to the end of your statement.

, You two need to act like you truly love each other (hopefully, though, it's not acting). Get physical, but if you're not comfortable with that, it's okay; you only have to be physical when people are watching, and you can only go so far while people are watching, so you're safe.

, This goes against how Rosalie is. She rides more ""solo"". If somebody invites you to a party, accept. However, if it's a dinner party and you KNOW you can't get by on ""I'm not hungry"", consider going, getting food, just doing it like lunch-eating when nobody's watching. If the person hosting it has already commented on your eating habits, it might be reasonable to say you have plans and can't go. If the person asks what the plans are, you don't have to tell them. Think about it, would Rose tell them plans? NOPE, so you shouldn't either. In fact, Rose would reply with something sassy, so do just that. Try something like ""Mind your own business"", or (this one is VERY Rosalie-ish) ""What is it to you?""

, It is not advised you act like Rosalie Hale if you are overweight. You need to be VERY skinny. However, don't stop eating and get anorexic, because you'll look unhealthy, and that's unlike Rose. Instead, just eat healthier and exercise. You must be very fast and strong, too. Run so you'll get faster, and lift weights, do sit ups, crunches, push ups, and the such to get stronger. If you think or know somebody is stronger than you, please don't arm wrestle them.

, When you see a baby, get all sweet and soft and admire it. Compliment the mother by saying something like ""What a beautiful baby you have."" Then it helps to say ""How old is s/he?"" and get into a conversation. Don't get very deep, though, as Rose doesn't get deep. Also, don't talk about things you don't know. Now, Rose dreams about marrying a husband, having many kids, a sweet house, and a loving family, so talk about the future (but remember you don't talk much, so only talk about this if it's brought up, and it's best only to talk about it if somebody else addresses you on the subject).

, You should be able to point at a random car and say what it is. And you should be a mechanic queen. Rose is the car person of the family, and anything that's only hers, she's carries with pride. If you're at school or something and your friend says her car isn't sounding right, after school or during lunch you should be able to go out and fix it, or say the problem with it.

, At school or social gatherings, stick with your group of friends. When you go out alone, though, don't make conversation with others. Quietly stay to yourself (but make an entrance if you know what I mean). Only speak if you see somebody with a baby, and only if they're right beside you, and it won't be awkward to talk to them.

, Always look like there's something others aren't getting from you. When somebody talks to you, act as if they just broke your train of thought. Use eye-contact. Also, be very persuasive. Find ways to make your features (especially eyes & voice) be very persuasive to where you can get almost anything you want. Look at Persuade People

, Rose is exceptionally confident and proud of herself, so you must carry yourself like that. Walk with your chin up and shoulders back. Walk like a MODEL- that is very confident and looks great...very Rose-ish. When you talk, never talk like it's a question; talk like the words from your mouth is a fact. Carry your whole body with purpose. Walk with dignity, because in Rose's mind, she is the definition of ""dignity"", ""confidence"", ""grace"", and ""beauty"".

, It helps to take dance class in this category, so I would recommend that. Learn how to walk elegantly and gracefully. When you walk, sort of roll up from your heel onto your toe. Walk with your head up and shoulders back. Absolutely never slouch- when Rose was growing up, she probably never let her back touch the back of the chair, so you shouldn't either. Sit up straight and tall. Also, walk one in the front of the other (I don't mean take baby steps). NEVER TRIP.

, Always look very aware of your surroundings. Use peripheral vision. Never let anyone sneak up on you, or scare you. Don't turn sharp corners into a room, in case somebody is going to scare you or run into you. Also, brace yourself when you turn (not sharply), so that your reflexes are quick. That being said, have quick reflexes. Don't trip- watch where you walk. Really focus when you have to use hand-eye coordination, so you don't end up messing something up. You simply can't be clumsy- This is Rose's article, not Bella's.

, Try out for every school play, take classes from your local theater, and do plays there. You have to be the best actress, and, well, a good liar. Also, you must be a beautiful singer. I'm so sorry (I really am, I don't want to be mean), but you have to be a good singer. Ask your friend to be honest about your voice, and tell them that you don't mind if you can't sing (lying of course, I told you you had to be a good liar). If they say you're good, record yourself and listen- you'd be surprised at how much friends lie to spare your feelings. If your voice is good, you should probably take vocal lessons to be the best.

, Not second best, the best. This is especially important.

, Don't mention your knowledge unless asked, or it's being talked about in a discussion you're included in, though. It's great to stay up-to-date, so when somebody mentions a piece of news, you'll look very impressive when you know all about it. It also makes you look smarter, and all of the Cullens are very smart.

, It MUST have a mirror; look at yourself in the mirror every time you open the locker or pass through the halls. There should also be pictures in there, and many other cool locker things. You have to have a makeup pouch, but only apply makeup when nobody's watching. Looking in the mirror and brushing your hair when people are watching, though, is great. Use a hair pick instead of a brush, though. Of course you curl your hair in the long romantic waves, and a brush will take them out. Therefore, use a hair pick so the curls won't come out. Also, reapply hairspray if necessary about lunch time, but do this when nobody is watching. Don't forget, you have a makeup pouch; reapply you're makeup when necessary (as long as nobody is looking).

, This song is exactly Rose's life story and is beautiful. Look up on youtube the songs with the lyrics and you'll see what I mean. Download it onto your IPod, listen to it, memorize it, don't talk about it. It's okay to say you're favorite song is Beauty from Pain in a 'What's your favorite song?' discussion, but don't mention it at other times. Make this your audition song, too, for when you try out for musicals.

, Vampires don't leave things lying around- they keep it neat and tidy. Make sure your locker, purse, house, everything is neat. Have a very neat room. Rose doesn't have people over, but it's a good idea, in case you do end up having your best friend over (but don't do that often, because it's not Rose-ish). Think about it, would Esme let her ""kids"" just throw things around without picking them up?

, Read Classics (they're actually SUPER good). This would be what Rose read growing up and probably even after she'd been changed because it was something to hold to from her past. Honestly, they didn't have ""Lord of the Rings"" or books about wizards or books about whatever Warriors and Percy Jackson is about. Some of my favorite classics are Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre (impressive to read this), Wuthering Heights, Sense and Sensibility, and my all time fav, Gone With the Wind (this one is SUPER impressive to read, and everybody will be like ""how?""). The BEST possible one you can read is War and Peace, because it's gigantic (but it could be too advanced).

, So, it could be a good idea to get a job so you can use money to buy expensive things so you'll seem richer. Just don't flounce around your job, or better yet don't even say you have one, because obviously Rose wouldn't need a job.

, Rose is very close to the Cullen coven. So be very kind to your parents and siblings. If you have or a sibling close to you in age, see if they'll start being like Alice.

, Of course, it's impossible to be ""perfect"", but to be Rose, you have to be un-ordinarily close. So just don't mess up, okay? Rose doesn't like it when people disgrace her name.

Discover your power.,

Stick to the rules.,
Make it official.",How to Become Like a Halliwell," Learn first hand what it's like to be a Halliwell. Observe their lives from a non-based perspective and mentally take notes of the sisters and their attitudes towards what's happening around them.;
, Study your family tree, observe which parent you get your specific qualities from, know your hometown, etc...

, Take into consideration what you think of yourself as well as what others think of you. Draw out your habits/quirks, likes and dislikes, and what makes you unique. Take all of these qualities and embrace them enthusiastically.

, Each Halliwell has to have their own battle. It could be love, friendship, family, work, school, even yourself. Remember that these battles are not permanent, the goal is to overcome them and become a better person. For example, in Charmed, Phoebe's battle was love.

, Look deep within yourself and feel what your power may be. Pick a supernatural power you feel is right for you and give it a real-world emphasis. Examples of powers can be mental persuasion (implicating ideas in others' heads), weather control (changing the mood of a room), telekinesis (getting things done without the usual effort), shape shifting (channeling different traits and/or attitudes willingly), or premonition (choosing the right choice or path to follow). Look at your life and determine what your good at. Be creative. Remember, powers can grow, so it's possible to have more than one power. Three is the usual limit.

, This can be a talent, an addiction, a belief or all of the above. Find something that makes you, you. This should be so individualistic that when others are reminded of this certain ""thing"" the first thing they think of is you. For example, Piper's thing was cooking and cleaning.

, When you are out and just happen to witness someone get hurt or someone crying, don't ignore it. These are innocents and you must try to help as many as possible. This includes teachers, co-workers, and in some cases evil bosses. Helping others helps yourself. The goal is to overcome your selfishness and at the same time make the world a better place even if it means sacrifice. For example, the sisters would rather save five strangers than one sibling.

, Give everything negative in life a name...a demonic name, such as the Demon of Laziness, the Demon of Bad Credit, the Demon of Backstabbing, or the Demon of Uncooperative Households. As a Halliwell, it's your duty to get rid of the evil in the world. If your a humanitarian, more power to you. Don't pick your battles, simply tackle them one at a time, you have to vanquish as many demons as possible to live that life you dream of living one day.

, Personal gain is a no-no. Refrain from stealing, cheating, and hurting other people. Remember these essential quotes: ""Everything happens for a reason"", ""It's our job to protect the innocent, not to punish the guilty"", and remember to ""Treat others as you'd like to be treated"" and that ""Everything that goes around, comes around.""

, You're a Halliwell now! Celebrate by having a little party for yourself or create a Charmed Ego for yourself. You can also start a diary which can be like your real-world book of shadows, change your facebook/IM/E-mail last name to Halliwell, or even legally change your name.

Think about your personality!,
Look at your hair!,
Your makeup is important too!,
Wardrobe time!,
Be social!,
Show off your talents!",How to Be Like Roberta Pardo from Rebelde," Many people like Roberta because of her stylish hair or her wardrobe, but the best about her is definitely her rocking personality!



Roberta's not your typical protagonist. She is recalcitrant, she always gets what she wants, she's plain-spoken, mean, and rebellious. However, her classmates really admire her. She's also really strong, and a kind of troublemaker!







Be kind! Roberta has a very big heart. She always helps out her friends, sometimes even her enemies.







Think about your own personality traits. How are you different from her? Do you have something in common with her? If you do, then good for you. If you don't, you can take steps to be more like her. Just keep in mind, that Roberta is a fictional character, while you are real. You are an individual, and you shouldn't be exactly like her. Stay yourself, and try to spice your personality with something you really admire her for.







Do what you feel like to do! Roberta often doesn't even think about the consequences.







Be independent! You can't always count on your friends. If you get into trouble, you should get out of it too!






While watching the series on YouTube, or on DVD, look at her gestures, sayings and study her reactions in different situations. If you focus on these, it can be quite useful.





;
, Roberta is also known for her wild hairstyles! It's always very cool and absolutely matches her style! There are a few ideas about what can you do about your own hair to look like her. You don't need to be exactly the same looking to be like her.



Color it! Roberta had two main hair colors during the series. Of course she always changed it somehow, and we could see her simple brown hair in the first episode.






You can put streaks in your hair, it doesn't need to be exactly the same like hers. Her first hairstyle had coontails in it.






Her second hair color was bright red, and towards the end, it became even brighter and wilder.









Style it! Roberta always liked changes, she always tried a new hairstyle, and sometimes she got a new haircut!






At the beginning, she had a simple medium-length haircut with coontails. Later, when she dyed her hair red, she got some layers and a short fringe too. Then she let her hair grow, and around the end (when Miguel had an amnesia, for example) she got a cool mullet hairstyle. In the wedding, she wore extensions.






Experiment with new hairstyles! Roberta often braided her hair or made a ponytail. It's really up to you!









, Try to find the colors that you wear really often, and make your face colorful with it! You can find a lot of tutorial on YouTube.


While she had dark brown hair , she kept it simple. She applied an eyeliner, and a sparkly lipgloss.






Later on, when she dyed her hair red , she still used black eyeliner, and peach eyeshadow with nude lips.







, Roberta's wardrobe is just as crazy as she is. She really likes black, but there are a lot of colorful pieces in her dresser. She often wears neon colors, prints and blacks, but we can mostly see her in the uniform of Elite Way School .

, You should make your voice heard. You can be known by a lot of people even if you don't befriend with those you hate. Be a rebel and be someone who don't join those dumb popular girls like Mía Colucci!



Make sure you have some friends on your side. They make the most important part of your highschool years. Even if you'll forget them, and even if they have their own mistakes, they'll always be on your side.







Always stay strong. In this society, stronger people will trample on weaker people.







Don't be afraid to argue. You are an individual, and it's natural to have your own opinion and point of view. Maybe some people won't like it, but it's completely natural too. Just don't let them to manipulate you by being huffy.







, Roberta is a singer in the band, RBD and she also was a member of the dance club.



Find something you do well and enjoy doing it. You don't have to be an excellent singer to be like Roberta. Do what you like and that's it. If you're an excellent writer, photographer or you can paint, or even if you are good in sports, that's really good too.







Rock your ideas! Roberta always knows how to get out of trouble, and also, how to get in it!

Be true to yourself, and try to express your own feelings. But if you don't want to do this, you can maybe find something like writing poems, or something else.;
, Peyton listens to a lot of punk, rock and lots of alternative bands. She also listens because of the lyrics, sometimes listening to different music depending on her mood. Music such as the bands below are places to start. Peyton doesn't go to any concerts, or at least not so much.

Be yourself.",How to Be Like the Girls from Alpha Academy," Are you good at inventing? Dancing? Art? Writing? Acting? Cooking? Singing? Modeling? A particular sport?


Find your talents, or take lessons in things that appeal to you and see if you are good at them. When you find the things that you are good at, work hard at them.
Take as many lessons as possible and practice all the time when you don't have class or other work to complete. Consider applying for specialized classes or schools that help you focus on your talent. (Triple Threat is an amazing dancer, and she practices all the time and is a rule-abiding Alpha).
Look for careers doing those things your are good at and enjoy. If what you are doing seems 'uncool' to others, forget them; they'll be cheering for you someday.;
, Be the best at everything you do, or become good at it. As an example:


Triple Threat is the ultimate law-abiding Alpha, who follows the rules and does amazingly in everything she does.
Skye Hamilton was the best dancer in Westchester, which is what landed her at Alpha Academy.

, An Alpha is not stupid; she does not use excessive vulgar language or fail classes. At Alpha Academy, the only way you can buy anything is to get As. (As Shira said, ""You could live off an A for a week, but an F will leave you skinnier than salmonella. That's just like life m'dear: You fail, you starve."")


Aim to get straight As throughout the entire school year. If that's too easy, get an A+. Bs are acceptable, but they aren't the best.
Expand your vocabulary, read books, and make sure your grades are up.
Never use vulgar language, because it makes you look stupid.
Apply for scholarships if you are starting your senior year. Apply to as many as possible. Get sponsored, and participate in school extracurriculars and philanthropy. It will get you most recognition and having different activities looks great on college applications.

, Do you think those girls made it every time? No! They had to try to be the best, they had to work for it. If you can't land that pirouette, practice every day till you can.


Skye Hamilton said Triple was like 'a social-less robot,'but it allowed her to be the best dancer in the class.
Shira would have never tolerated crying during failure. In Belle of the Brawl, she said ""Failure should make you TRY, not CRY.""

, No matter what you're doing, always come out on top. It may not always be a competition, but the only way to be the best is to beat the rest. That's what being an Alpha is all about: hard work paying off. You can't be an Alpha as a number 2 - unless you're a pencil- which is highly unlikely. Number 2. The letter B. Second place is spelled B-E-T-A. Not Alpha.


Study for those tests to get the highest grade.
Practice your instrument so that you can be the best in band class.
Dance extra hours so that you can be the top ballet dancer in your class.
Beat the rest, be the best!!

, In real life, the stakes are not so high when it comes to being the best. Instead of being brutally competitive toward your fellow Alphas and trying to be better than they are, focus on the only way to truly be the best – to be better than your past self.


When it comes to your friendships with other girls, it is best to support each other because there are going to many Alphas out there and there is no way to truly be ""better"" than someone else.
Do NOT go out of your way to sabotage your competition, even if you have a personal vendetta against them. You may knock them down a few pegs at first, but people will eventually find out and it will backfire majorly.

, At Alpha Academy, everything is tailored to their special dietary needs. If you're a singer, you will probably need some tea sweetened with honey to improve your vocals. If you're a dancer, you will need protein bars and shakes. If you're an inventor, songwriter, actress, or writer, you will probably need brain food like fruit smoothies and low-fat popcorn.


Eat healthy meals, and skip fatty foods and avoid too much red meat. Stick to poultry, seafood and plant-based proteins for the most part.
You don't need to eat like an anorexic person (nor should you develop an eating disorder), just eat and pay close attention to each bite, and when you have even the slightest feeling of being full, even if you haven't finished your food, put the fork down.
Include a wide variety of healthy food in your diet. They serve plenty of exotic and vitamin/antioxidant rich food at the Alpha Academy: curry, croissants, chamomile hibiscus tea, acai berry sorbet, etc.

, Every Alpha needs to be in good health and good shape to perform her duties. The Alpha is a machine with a heart. She has a sharp mind, and a toned body. Find an exercise regime if you aren't doing anything physical. Participate in a sport; any sport or physical activity should do. (Alpha Academy has like, every sport/club in existence) Whether it's practicing extra for ballet or playing soccer, you need to be in shape.

, An Alpha is on top of everything, and is immaculate! (Don't be like AJ - in the books it says her bed and night table is a complete mess! Foundation on her sheets! Allie even mistook AJ for being a ferret hidden in her bed! )


Carry around mini bottles of Purell like Allie A.
Shower every day, shave, and wear antiperspirant/deodorant.
Wash your hair at least every other day, condition, and use leave-in conditioner if you have to. Rinse your hair with cold water when washing and conditioning your hair to make it shine. Let it air dry, or give it a perfect blow dry.
Never have any acne or skin problems. Get a tan if you want, and find facial/body products that leave your skin smooth, soft, and blemish free. Tailor your use of skin products according to your needs. Dull skin? Facial scrub! Acne? Salicylic Acid wash! Lackluster? Vitamin/antioxidant rich moisturizer. If your skin problems are persistent or painful, go to a dermatologist for a regime tailored to your needs. Always wear sunscreen and makeup with SPF in it to prevent premature aging- even if you don't burn in the sun.
Have a manicure and pedicure that looks beautiful and professionally done.

, Perfect skin, rosy cheeks, plump pink lips, and doll lashes are all ideal (the Alpha Academy girls know what looks best on them).


Never use too much makeup. All you really need is: #**concealer/foundation or tinted moisturizer

lip color/gloss/balm
mascara (fake lashes if you want thicker ones)
eyeshadow (if you want)
blush (a highlighter can be used to accentuate your bone structure)


You can use brands from Sephora, which is usually what the girls use. However, there's some drugstore products from Loreal Paris, Revlon, Maybelline and Cover Girl that work beautifully. Try different brands to see what works best for you.

, Make sure your hair is perfect and beautiful every time. Always look gorgeous wherever you go.


Use hair products that work for your hair type.
Carry a mini hairbrush/comb and a travel-size hairspray in your bag to touch up your tresses throughout the day. This is especially helpful if you're prone to flyaways or frizz.

, (Have you ever seen an Alpha in sweats and a hoodie? And if you have, what were they wearing? Probably a cute hoodie from Victoria's Secret Pink and skinny Abercrombie sweats tucked into expensive limited edition Ugg boots).


You don't need to be rich to have a great wardrobe, and it doesn't need to be entirely designer either; save the splurging for a special occasion or a practical item you'll use a lot, like a handbag.
Have a pretty extensive wardrobe, and include flattering dresses, jeans, tops, bottoms, lounging clothes, weekend clothes. Just be in style, and make sure the clothes look beautiful on you.

, Buy an iPod Touch (the real life version of the aPod) and use it as an organizer. Don't let the little things others do bother you. Have a designer handbag/backpack (or at least a super cute one that goes with all outfits) and keep all your stuff in it: your makeup bag, cell phone, iPod, chewing gum, hairbrush, elastics/bobby pins, etc.

, Learn how to flirt, and how to attract the guys you want.


Remember to keep your priorities in place. You can have a relationship with a boy without failing a class or missing a step in ballet. 'Boys are toys--only to be played with after the important things are done'.
Read articles about boys online and in magazines like Cosmopolitan. Learn how to talk to guys, and be confident. Talk to boys all the time, and look good for the fellas! Flirt, girls, flirt like mad!

, After you've completed all these steps, you need to actually go out and DO something with it.


Sign a contract with a talent agency, go to casting calls, try out for your ballet school's Nutcracker when you know that scouts are going to be there.
Remember to start off small before you go big - that's just how it is.
Make as many connections in your area of expertise as possible, you never know when they may come in handy or offer once-in-a-lifetime opportunities.

, Just because you are super-efficient doesn't mean you can't have a bit of fun once in a while. Go and meet your Brazille boy late at night, text him, flirt, take risks. Not only is Alpha Academy a Paradise, but the girls have fun doing everything they do. (The Jackie O girls sneaked out to meet the boys in Alphas, and they almost got caught. But they had fun doing it.)

, Make yourself known throughout school so that even if you don't know everyone, absolutely everyone knows about YOU. (The Alpha girls are known throughout their school - and the world - as the best).


Be fun and outgoing, very social and sweet. Be confident and talk to people, ask them questions about themselves, or compliment them on an outfit. Smile at people. Talk to absolutely everyone you come in contact with.
At the same time, keep a good head on your shoulders and avoid being manipulated by others, especially guys.

, At the end of the day, the only way to truly be an Alpha is to BE YOU. Alphas are all unique individuals with one thing in common – the drive, desire, and determination to WIN.


The Alpha's journey is a tough one, filled with challenges and obstacles. This is why it's extremely important that you don't lose yourself along the way.
You are you – and that's what makes you special. You have all the raw materials. Now all you need to do is go out and work for what you want. That's what makes you an Alpha.

,
Be attractive to boys.,
Most important of all, be a rebel.

",How to Be Like Mia Colucci from Rebelde Way," In the first season, Mia has a simple haircut: long light brown hair with even ends and thin bangs. In the second season, she cuts her hair in scales, but the bangs and colour stay the same. Her hair always looks the best, so you can use your flat-iron or your dryer to achieve the smooth straight look. Go to the hair salon as frequently as you can. Remember, one of Mia's favourite things to do is cut her hair.;
, To achieve this look, use face wash and moisturizer daily. Also, drink plenty of water and eat fruits and vegetables. Visit a dermatologist at least once a month. Spa treatments are also great for your skin.

, Try to make it seem as natural as possible. Mia never goes with tons of make-up. Use only foundation, some mascara and lip gloss for the day. At night you can use some harsher make-up.

, Mia takes very good care of her body. She eats very healthily and avoids carbohydrates. For breakfast she eats mostly fruits. Mia also exercises to maintain her sleek, sexy figure. To achieve this body, focus on eating more fruits and vegetables and limit the carbohydrates and the processed foods. For exercising, it is not necessary to go to the gym! Mia does exercises in the privacy of her own home.

, She wears either a white nail polish or a French. As long as the colour is soft and girly and feminine, it's alright to wear it. You can do your own nails or you can go to the nail salon. You should also put cream on your hands so they are always soft.Wear a lot of rings on your fingers, but make sure they are thin and delicate ones.You can also find a nice watch to wear on your hands, since Mia always has one.

, You don't have to spend tons of money to achieve her look. Just look for more girly and ladylike clothes, like for example shirts and tees and jeans. Just make sure you get mostly clothes with lively colours, especially pink, since Mia rarely wears dark clothes (except for the nights, sometimes).

, It's important that you keep your shoulders back and move your hips. If you need help, you can look on the Internet or go to dance lessons.

, Mia is the leading choreographer of Elite Way School, so she has a natural talent for dancing. You can attend dance lessons to learn how to dance well.

, Mia is nothing if not confident. Even when disasters happen to her, she puts on a big smile and keeps her shoulders back, and doesn't show the world she is down. She discusses her private things only with her closest friends. Try to have more confidence in yourself and be positive, because life is a great adventure. And don't be afraid to desnude yourself in public. Just don't do this very often.

, Mia loves her friends and helps them whenever she can. Try to be there for your friends. If you don't have any, then make some! Mia is generally nice to people (except ones that disagree with her) and has a lot of friends. Have best friends and share all your secrets with them.

, Mia has a very strong personality and stands for what she believes. Don't let people run you over; be a leader! Let them know you have principles - they will respect you for that. But don't get too bossy, because you might be thrown away.

, Room is a very important part of being like Mia. Your room should be in girly colours. Pink, purple or red are all acceptable. Put a lot of stuffed animals and pillows on your bed. Have a pane where you put all your pictures and keep your desk organised.

, Even though she is not very interested in school, Mia maintains good grades. You don't have to be on the top of your class - just don't get bad grades and you'll be fine.

, Mia loves her daddy and she'd do anything for him. She loves her mother also, but she is dead. Love your parents but don't get overly attached to them.

, Since Mia is very rich and has got almost everything she wants, she is spoiled and snobbish, but not too much. She is very nice to people that are nice to her and are not rich, like Luna for example. Seem snobbish at first sight, but be a good person inside.

, Mia is very romantic. She daydreams a lot and fantasies about something (mostly including Manuel). She also gets very excited when something happens to her that's connected to love (and mostly that includes Manuel).

, Whether it's a broken nail or something that she really doesn't like, trust Mia to turn it into a drama. She is very whiny and hates things like insects, dirty objects, clothes out of taste or really anything that's out of fashion.

, Mia is the typical girly girl who appreciates everything girly. She likes everything that has taste and is pretty.

,, Flirt with them by walking seductively, pulling and twisting your hair with your fingers, giving sexy mysterious looks - whatever you prefer! Be picky about who you go out with - you don't want to be labeled an easy chick. If aren't very pretty and boys don't notice you, just be confident and tidy - you'll see how they'll suddenly notice.

Don't be a pushover.,
Be sarcastic and snarky.,
Don't care what people think of you.,
Dress in gothic styles.,
Make friends with a range of people.,
Have a boyfriend that understands you.",How to Be Like Jade West from Victorious," Jade always has strong opinions, and is never afraid to voice them. She's quite vocal and sometimes rude, which you may want to avoid, but she stands up for what she believes in - even if it's just telling Tori to get out of her chair.;
, When Jade is in the picture, she's never totally polite to people. Even when it seems like she's going to say something nice, she always ends her statement with a line that earns her a weird look. Learn how to be witty, and don't be afraid to be a bit rude to get your point across.



Don't be too rude. Jade doesn't flat-out insult people, and being rude just to be like Jade is just going to get you to lose friends. Rather, she's quite coy about how she insults people, but you probably don't want to insult people, either!

, Jade is a rebel, and doesn't give people's opinions a second thought, or even give them a thought at all. Don't care about people's opinions of you, and if someone tries to say something rude about you, either don't respond or give them a snarky answer, such as, ""I didn't know the trash in your head could come out of your mouth"".

, Jade wears mostly dark-colored clothing, and is never seen without color in her hair. Try reading up on how to dress like her to get a better understanding of what to wear to look like Jade.

, As odd as it seems, Jade is on friendly terms with just about everyone. She's dating Beck, is friends with Cat and André, and while she's not really friends with Tori and Robbie, she's friendly (for her personality, anyway). The only person she's shown to legitimately dislike is Trina, due to her lack of talent and how snobby she can be. You don't have to dislike people just because they don't fit a certain image, but try to make friends with a diverse group of people.

, You don't need to have a boyfriend to be like Jade - she and Beck spent quite some time apart, after all - but it can certainly help your image. Be softer-spoken around your boyfriend and don't be rude to him.

If they don't look good on you, don't use them. Just stay with the jest (natural, professional look) and don't overdo your make-up.

, Kate is extremely smart, otherwise she wouldn't have such an important job. If you want to be like her, work on your education to improve your career chances.

, She exudes confidence without being arrogant. You can do that by being aware of your personal strengths and weaknesses and working hard. This will keep you feeling in control of your life and proud of your achievements. Also, Kate has a strong sense of humor and does not get ticked off easily. You can try improving in that area if you feel that you need to.

, Go for a Red/Brown, it will look more natural! If you want, you could give yourself a light side fringe and flick your hair out with a straightener! It also looks really cool if you put a small, vintage clip in your hair with your fringe!

, Now, you may think that you should wear an oversize black top with stripe socks, but that's not the case. Shop online or look around for black, interesting 'Gothic Lolita' dresses, and find some really cool stripe socks to go with them! You might want to get some cool shoes to go with them too. Find variations of her style. If you want, instead of wearing a dress, you could wear a puffy skirt and a pretty top with stripe socks and shoes if you want. Or you could wear shorts/skinny leg jeans with an over-sized top with the 'Ruby Gloom' logo painted on it! (you will have to do this yourself, but more on that later). It's all up to you, do what you like!

Watch the film, closely re-watch scenes that include the Joker and how he behaves.,
Practice the Joker's posture and mannerisms.,
Imitate his voice and manner of speech.,
Practice The Joker's laugh.,
Do things for no apparent reason.,
If you do have reasons for doing things, hide them!,
Have no fear.,
Never take anything too seriously.,
Gain more intelligence.,
Be charismatic.,
The Joker is known for being, well, a joker.,
Emulate the Joker's dress style.,
If you really want to take this one step further, you can also change your facial appearance.,
Most of the above instructions have been inferred from the movie.",How to Act Like The Joker," Notice every little detail. This will help you to absorb his character and understand the way he thinks.;
, Learn to walk the odd way he does and make a habit of licking your lips and contorting your mouth like he does.

, The Joker's voice in the Dark Knight is quite hard to copy at first, but you can soon get the hang of it. At times it is quite husky, and other times his voice drops to only a whisper. Learn when to talk loudly and when to talk quietly. When learning how to copy the way he talks and the types of words he uses, keep everything you say brief and to the point. Never drone on about anything, and make sure everyone you talk to is always listening.

, The Joker is known for being crazy and what do crazy people do most often? Laugh. Learn when to laugh, and when not to laugh. The Joker's laugh is a sort of husky cackle that is hard to imitate, but just like his voice you can soon get the hang of it if you practice. When you laugh, exhale first instead of inhaling like most people. This is how you achieve the Joker's cackle.

, The Joker does things just for the sake of doing them. He has no plan or motive, and he doesn't care about the consequences. He just thinks of something and does it without giving it much thought. However, don't do anything dangerous like walking into oncoming traffic or jumping off buildings.

, Never let people know what you are up to, and always hide your intentions.

, This may seem a bit ""Batman-like"" but it's also essential if you want to become the Joker. The Joker is not afraid of being locked up. He's not afraid of Batman. He's not afraid of the police. He's not afraid to die. When Batman beat him up while interrogating him, all the Joker did was just laugh.

, Always see the light-hearted and funny side of everything. The Joker makes loads of funny jokes and comments but keep in mind that he doesn't overdo it. Make sure you have the right timing for your jokes and only say them in the right situations; otherwise people will think you are just trying desperately to be funny.

, Even if you are already smart, become smarter. The Joker is extremely intelligent and cunning no matter how crazy he seems. He always has backup plans and people doing his dirty work.

, The Joker is an evil, murdering sociopath, yet whenever he's on the screen one can't look away. The Joker has an air of confidence and is very interesting from his mannerisms to the things he says. Try to emulate this.

, He is known for being mischievous and cunning, and always has a thing or two up his sleeve. Make sure you carry some prank items with you at all times, and keep them in weird places, like in your shoes or in your sleeves as the metaphor says.

, You don't have to go and buy a Joker costume, but just dress formally. Make sure the clothes you wear look classy but a little shabby at the same time. They don't have be purple and green like the Joker's suit, but make sure they are unique and original.

, However, this step is not recommended and only do it if you are really desperate to be the Joker. You will probably be ridiculed, but then again you are now the Joker; why would you care? The Joker has medium long wavy green hair, wears loads of white makeup, has dark eyeliner around his eyes, and of course his signature red grin. Make sure you apply the dye and/or make up messily, the Joker is not neat and tidy. Don't completely dye your hair; have parts of it not dyed to look more shabby. When applying the make up, make a lot of smudges around the red grin and black eyeshadow.

, This is an interpretation of how to act like the Joker. There's not a whole lot to cite except for the movie, but then again, it's pointless to cite that. Why so serious?

To act like her, be friendly and outgoing, and introduce yourself to lots of new people.If there is anyone in your school classes you don’t know, for example, introduce yourself. Ask them questions about themselves and their lives. Make an effort to say hello to people you pass by.

Shout things like “Yay!” or “Awesome!” and clap your hands when you feel excited.

, Starfire has a reputation for really falling hard for her crushes. She has a tendency to be really flirtatious with the people she has crushes on. She even has a habit of kissing men she doesn’t know very well in order to learn their language, which is one of her abilities. To act like Starfire, try to be more flirtatious, especially with your crush.Standing close, giggling, and gently touching your crush’s arm are all good ways to flirt without being too forward.

To act like her, you should be courageous and stand up for yourself and your beliefs. Stay loyal to your friends and family, and let them know you’re there for them no matter what.Starfire never wants anyone else to go through the bad feelings and experiences she has been through herself. Protect the people you care about and be a good friend and confidant for them.

, If you are going to a convention, or just want to do a cosplay of Starfire, you can purchase her costume. There are many different online websites that sell versions of her costume, or if you’re handy at sewing, you could put one together yourself. Depending on how provocative you want your costume to be, there are more modest versions available online, or you can make a modest version of Starfire’s costume on your own.You can also buy separate pieces of clothing and alter them to be your costume. For example, you might buy a purple skirt and add a purple cut-off top to make her clothing.

, Starfire’s comic book character definitely dresses a bit more on the provocative side. On the Teen Titans cartoon, her costume is a little more modest, but still shows her midriff, and her short skirt reveals her upper thighs. Starfire’s character finds the clothes on Earth to be “prude” and prefers not to wear them. To act like Starfire, you might consider showing a little more skin or dressing a bit more provocatively.Starfire requires the power of the sun’s energy in order to fly. So, she shows more skin so she can absorb more of this energy and have the ability to fly., If you don’t want to go all out and wear Starfire’s costume, you can simply dress in purple clothing. Starfire’s costume is purple, so wearing purple clothes will at least resemble it in some ways. If you are trying to build your own Starfire costume, make sure each piece is purple.

Starfire is very feminine and girly. However you choose to dress to imitate her, try to make sure your purple clothes are also feminine. You might avoid boxy t-shirts or masculine cuts of pants.

, If you already have long hair, you could dye it the brown/auburn color of Starfire’s with semi-permanent or temporary hair dye. Or, you can purchase a Starfire wig. You can find wigs online that are modeled directly after Starfire’s hair, or you can purchase a regular wig that looks close to it.In her comic book form, her hair is much bigger and poofier than on the Teen Titans cartoon. Depending on which version of Starfire you’re trying to emulate, you should style your hair or wig accordingly.

, Starfire has a long, interesting history prior to even arriving on Earth.

Try reading about her online, or reading the Teen Titans comic book series to learn more about her story and history. That way, you can really channel her character that much more.


The internet is a great source of info on the individual characters from Teen Titans. You could even try asking people on Teen Titans message boards or forums about information on Starfire.

, Starfire can absorb the sun’s energy, or ultraviolet radiation, and use it as her powers. She uses this energy to fly, as well as to fire assaults at enemies when in battle. She always uses these powers for good, and to protect people in need.Starfire is an alien who came to Earth after being trapped and enslaved. She has experiments performed on her; this is how she became able to use her powers for destruction as well as for powering her flight.

, Over the years, Starfire’s different manifestations have come with varying backstories. She originally appeared in the New Teen Titans comic book series in the 1980s, and has since popped up in different story universes since then. If you want to act like her, it’s important to identify which “version” of Starfire you are emulating, so you can keep up with any changes to her character."

Be at ease with yourself.,
Be stealthy.,
Know what version you wish to follow of Natasha.",How to Act Like Natasha Romanoff1," Natasha is generally a very confident, easygoing, firm woman, with the ability of dry wit and humour. You don't exactly have to radiate charm, but try loosening up a little and being more confident - although not to the point where you're offensive to anybody. She is also a bouncy, sprightly woman, and very mature, so attempt to work these things into your manner. Don't go over the top - try to be subtle and mysterious!;
, Natasha is a trained spy and assassin, capable of any task given to her. This doesn't mean you have to attempt to spy on your next-door-neighbour as they hang out their washing, but it is always a good idea to be on top of everything that is happening in the world and in your personal life, such as school or family. A good activity to do is people-watching - go to your nearest coffee shop or mall, and watch the activity.

, Natasha's comic-book version is a more closeted, colder version of her, whilst her movie counterpart is more sassy and outgoing. You can follow one or you can combine the two.

Get confidence and power, and don't be shy about it.,
Dante can be very harsh and cruel to his enemies, (the DMC2 novel had him about to torture a helpless Devil to death, but he was interrupted) but is, at his core, a kind and caring person.,
Joke frequently and in all forms.,
Dante likes to be the center of attention all the time.,
Dante acts for the good of others as well as himself.,
It wouldn't hurt to pick up some physical and mental abilities.,
Be stylish.",How to Act Like Dante from Devil May Cry," Dante can face down the King of Hell, the Savior, and his twin brother Vergil in a fight without showing even a sliver of fear, so you should be confident in everything you do as well. Don't be afraid to taunt someone if they piss you off. Dante is famous for saying things to antagonize demons just for fun. In DMC4 Dante revs his sword like Nero leaning over implying ""test me with that sword"".;
, He let Nero keep Yamato(The sword given to Vergil by Sparda), comforted Lucia, and wept for Trish, He even gives Nero the sign of ""I'll see you later"" with a hand motion. Almost implying that he would look after Nero. You don't have to be a boy scout, but remember: Sparda was more powerful than any other Devil because he learned compassion. Which is a human emotion. Dante has, and you should too.

, In his youth, Dante was very sarcastic and comical.Taunting his brother on top of the tower in DMC3,he says ""You've got some fun planned for me RIGHT Vergil?"" He became more serious over time, but never completely lost that part of himself. Anytime a demon tries to attack Dante, he will make fun of their attributes. When facing Cereberus he made the joke that he was going to take him for a walk. After killing Berial he says ""What a shame, I was expecting more than just a few fireworks"", implying that he was barely challenged by him.

, (this may have faded in time as well, but it shows more than once during DMC3), so conquer your stage fright and be a star. Dante always aims to be stylish in all actions, and you should be too.

, There's nothing wrong with making sure you get some, but don't be a hoarder at the expense of others.

, Dante is half Devil from his father Sparda and is capable of extraordinary physical feats, so it wouldn't hurt to learn parkour, royal guard techniques,using Yamato, gunslinging, or sword fighting with Rebellion or Alastor to come closer to his techniques and skills. He's also displayed well above average intelligence when it comes to fighting anyone, so don't be a careless(or foolish)fighter. Dante uses Trickster to move at high speeds, so make sure to exercise your legs and learn to replicate his Trickster dash. Try forward at first, and then learn all four directions. Dante is also a master of all Devil Arms, if it a Devil Arm, he can basically fuse with it if he destroys the demon using them,and understand it almost instantaneously. Aim to understand all uses of a weapon uses rather than just one way of using them.

, Dante dresses in outfits that he considers extremely stylish. He's well known for mainly wearing red, but is frequently seen wearing brown (2,3) and black (1,4) as well. He also performs actions simply because he finds them stylish (think of how he answers his phone for a great example). Dante is infamous for taunting everyone. Practice his taunts and what he says during them. Taunt when you want to get a rise out of someone, but expect something back. Nero threw Rebellion through Dante's chest after Dante taunted him. So be careful who you taunt.

"
"
Be clean and groomed.,
Be fit and healthy.",How to Act Like Natasha Romanoff2," Natasha's hair is naturally red/auburn; if you wish you can dye your hair or wear it straight or curled. As long as you look well-kept and clean, there is nothing to worry about. Some appearance suggestions would be:


A black PVC zip-down jumpsuit/catsuit with the S.H.I.E.L.D logo on both of the upper arms, black boots, and a utility belt containing her various spy gear;
A beige leather jacket, silver arrow necklace, white t-shirt, black jeans, and high-heeled brown boots (Captain America: The Winter Soldier);
A red t-shirt with a black sweater over the top, a beige leather jacket (different to the one worn in Captain America 2), black jeans, and black heeled ankle boots;
A black cocktail dress (Iron Man 2)
Getting booked in for a haircut; a trim and clean-up will do;
A french manicure or painting your nails with clear polish (make sure your nails are short but not bitten - long nails would break on spy missions!);
Pale pink lipstick or chapstick, with a little foundation and mascara.

, Natasha is often running towards danger or fighting danger. Go jogging or running, and lift weights to improve your arms. Learning how to fight is not recommended, but a useful skill if you want to be as much like the Black Widow as possible. Suggestions would be karate, kickboxing, or Muay Thai martial arts.

The Cane.,
The Pills.,
The Clothes.,
The Look.",How to Be Like Gregory House1," Get a good quality cane made of wood or one made of black metal with flames at the bottom. Hold it in your right hand and limp as though your right leg is in constant pain.;
, While House takes Vicodin whenever he is feeling pain or stress, Tic-Tacs or other breath mints will work just as fine.

, Dress in sports coats over oxford shirts or t-shirts with a logo or design on them. Never wear dress pants or shoes; instead, opt for jeans free of holes, but can be distressed and a pair of tennis shoes or sneakers. The overall look should be put-together, but still very casual.

, House always has permanent five o'clock shadow, so shave often enough where you do not have a beard but no so often you look clean-shaven. Keep your hair trimmed, but long enough to look somewhat messy. Wear contacts instead of glasses, but if you are on the computer, glasses are fine.

Ride a racing motorcycle, such as a Yamaha or Suzuki, not something like a Harley Davidson or a chopper.,
Get a hand-held video game system, such as a Game Boy or PSP and play it if you are bored or waiting for something.

,
Keep up with the pop culture and make references to it in everyday speech every now and again.,
Seek education to expand your mind.",How to Be Like Gregory House2," Wear a helmet that covers your entire head and a leather motorcycle jacket - yes, even someone like House makes sure to be safe!

,, Some of House's favorite shows are General Hospital and Monster Truck rallies.

, House can play the piano and guitar and can speak languages such as Hindi, Mandarin and Spanish. While learning these specific skills would be most House-like, simply always looking for something new to learn -and using it!- would be fine.

"
"
House's motto is ""Everybody lies."",
Be a very diligent observer and use your observations to draw conclusions.,
Be quick witted and be able to think on your feet.,
Be sarcastic whenever necessary, which is very often.,
Do not try to be polite or kind.,
Only do things if it benefits you in some way.,
Do not seek to have a large circle of friends, but rather a few really close ones.,
While you may have emotions and pain, be stoic and do not express your emotions other than anger, irritation, etc and only complaining about extreme physical pain.

,
Be the best or one of the best at something you enjoy.",How to Be Like Gregory House3," It is just a matter of what they are lying for, which may be for good or bad. As such, do not believe everything people tell you and instead use your own observation and intuition to tell you what is really the truth.

, House is a such a good Diagnostician because he is able to see very subtle clues about people and be able to determine underlying factors from them.

, It is very rare that House does not have a snappy comeback for something.

, Make sure it is true sarcasm and not simply adding, ""...not!"" to the end of phrases or starting them with ""NO!"" in an over-the-top way.

, Say what is on your mind and do not be afraid to offend people. Of course, this only applies to people who deserve it, such as stupid people or people you work with all of the time.

, If you do not get your way, manipulate people by finding something that annoys the particular person the most and doing that. For example: Sally hates squeaky shoes. So, whenever you are near Sally make your shoes squeak. Usually this is something that requires some amount of planning and is not something as simple as making an annoying sound or face.

, While many times they will anger you and you do the same to them, they prove to be more loyal than most.

,, House is the best doctor there is, for example. It would be extra House-like if you did it not to help people, but because you enjoy solving puzzles or figuring things out.

, If it's bad, it's bad. Oh well. Move on. It's easier for some, but for others, it's nearly impossible. Try focusing on the good aspects of the game (music is a good example) instead.

, If you see someone making blatant rude remarks about a Sonic couple, leave it. Let them have their own opinion. Many shipping wars are baited, anyway.

, You're not always going to agree in such a diverse fandom. Bite your tongue and leave it alone. Respect each universe and the properties contained within. You don't have to like them, just acknowledge them.

, This is a major part of why the Sonic fanbase is disliked. Educate them politely and properly, correct their mistakes, and provide proof.

, Explain to them the main game canon, its properties, story and characters. If they ask about a specific universe, then proceed to go further. If you yourself are not that familiar with the series, just say, ""Sorry, I'm not really the person to ask.""

When you attack your target your victim is on his back. one leg is on one side the other is on the other side of your victim.

Now generally when a hunter is in this position he will be clawing at he's victims abdomen in the hunters blood frenzy. Now that pretty much covers pouncing, face clawing.

Always help out your friends, and keep a cool head, even when someone annoys you. Fluttershy has a temper, but it takes a lot to get her mad. Most important of all, be kind; Fluttershy is the Element of Kindness, after all.


Fluttershy sees beauty in everyone and everything. She gives ""everypony"" a chance, even Discord.
Fluttershy gives nice opinions, especially she thinks the truth will hurt her friends' feelings. However, when pressed hard enough, she will be honest.;
, This is Fluttershy's most notable trait. When Twilight Sparkle first meets her, she had trouble hearing what Fluttershy is saying. When you talk, speak softly, as though you are talking to a cute forest critter you would not want to scare away.


Fluttershy speaks very softly to people she does not know. Her voice is more normal around those she trusts or is close to.
Fluttershy also has a very soft giggle and sneeze.

, Fluttershy is uncomfortable when she gets too much attention. She would be the last to put herself out there and volunteer. Try holding yourself back, and not talking unless called upon. Here are some other ideas for coming off as shy:


Keep your hands close to you, either clasped in front of your lap or cupped by her collar. These are common Fluttershy stances in the Equestria Girls movies.
Play with your hair, as though you are nervous. Fluttershy often does this in Equestria Girls.

Skip on the scary things, such as haunted houses and scary movies. Fluttershy does not like them either!

, In ""Green Isn't Your Color,"" from season 1, Rarity points out that she is fond of Fluttershy's grace and beauty. If you trip over your feet once or twice, that's okay, but for the most part, try to have some grace. Keep your movements smooth (like a dancer's) and not sharp or jagged (like a martial artist's).


If you have troubles being graceful, try taking some dance classes.

, Help out at animal shelters and have some pets of your own if you can. Animals are Fluttershy's main priority, as she likes to take care of them.


Try volunteering at your local pet shelter.
Consider getting some notebooks, folders, and pencil cases with cute animals on them.
If you have a pet, hang a picture of him or her in your locker or bedroom.

, Despite her love for animals and nature, Fluttershy actually knows a fair amount about fashion—or at least the sewing part of it—as is evident in several episodes, including ""Suited for Success"" in season 1. She is also Rarity's spa buddy, and enjoys treating herself, as seen in ""Green Isn't Your Color,"" from season 1. Unlike Rarity, however, Fluttershy goes for the simple options.When going for a manicure or pedicure, go for the basics. Let your fashion-loving friend spoil herself with the mud wrap and rose-petal foot bath.
Teach yourself how to sew.

, Fluttershy loves to sing, but she hates showing off—which is a shame, because she has a beautiful voice. She is very shy, so she only sings when she's by herself or with her animal friends. Try singing something soft and sweet—nothing too loud or fast or energetic.

, Fluttershy often has troubles standing up for herself. This is one of Fluttershy's flaws, and it's not one you should try to replicate. The other ponies often bully Fluttershy and force her into doing things she does not want to do. Many of her episodes end with Fluttershy learning how to stand up for herself. They also end with her friends learning that it's not okay to force others into doing things they don't want to do.


Learn from the mistakes Fluttershy and her friends make. It's okay to be shy and timid like Fluttershy, but it's also okay to stand up for yourself and say ""No.""
As the series has progressed, Fluttershy has gotten better at standing up for herself.

, Fluttershy is associated with all things airy, fluttery, and natural. You can give off the Fluttershy vibe by wearing anything that is flowing, billowy, and loose fitting. This does not mean that all your clothes have to be loose-fitting. For example, you could pair a fluttery skirt with a girlish shirt. Here are some clothing styles that work well for Fluttershy:


Peasant blouses and shirts with loose sleeves
Long, flowing skirts
Skirts with petal-like hems
Other boho/bohemian styles

, Yellow and pink are Fluttershy's colors. But the shy, animal-loving pony also likes to wear green when she dresses up for special occasions, such as the Grand Galloping Gala. Her Equestria Girls counterpart also wears green.

, Fluttershy can be girly, and her Equestria Girls counterpart is one of the few girls who does wear eyeshadow. Go for a soft look with pastel colors, such as: pink, light green, or baby blue. Fluttershy also has long lashes, giving her almost a doll-like look. Consider wearing lengthening mascara.


If you are a child, be sure to ask your parents for permission first.

, This is Fluttershy's mane and tail color. You don't have to dye your hair pink if you don't want to. Even some pink ribbons or highlights will do.


Avoid bright or dark pinks. Aim for something soft, like baby pink, pastel pink, or even bubblegum pink.
Try some hair chalk. It washes out easily, and doesn't clump your hair like colored hairspray.
Try pink clip-in extensions.

, If you have straight hair, try adding a soft wave to it. This will help make your hair look more ""fluttery."" If you want, you can try adding a simple, pink butterfly clip or a delicate flower wreath.

, Fluttershy has three pink butterflies as her cutie mark. If you want to give off the Fluttershy vibe, add a pink butterfly patch or two to your jeans, skirt, or backpack. Many of Fluttershy's styles also feature yellow or blue flowers. These are usually in her hair, or sewn as embellishments along the hem or collar of her dress.

Read like crazy! Bring books to school and talk about them with your friends!

, Twilight has the ""Adorkable"" look, one of cute but nerdy and dorky. Knee socks and argyle or plaid patterns are ideal, and you should try to wear accessories with stars on them! Glasses would be cute and add to the effect as well. Wear mainly purple or pink accessories, as well as white and maybe some blue. Try light purple eyeshadow but nothing else that is flashy in that way. Bangs are very good.

, It takes skill to dress as Applejack would without looking as though you might be in a costume.


Don't wear a hat; that is too over the top. Wear plaid boyfriend shirts in warm colors.
Keep the look simple. Light blue jeans or jean shorts are all you need for pants.
Loosely ponytail your hair. Bandana around the girl's neck is cute as well.

, Put yourself out there; if something silly or random pops into your head, don't hesitate to say it loud and proud! Cheer up anyone who needs cheering up, and try your best to be funny.

, Throw a party! There are some wikiHows for how to do this; just try to keep guests entertained and do things such as dancing, games, and serving cake. Nail those little quirks of bouncing up and down, talking quickly, and giggling, but tone it down a notch if people begin to find you annoying.

Compliment your friends on things they do well, and even if they don't do it well, don't insult them. Babysit or pet sit; looking out for those who are small is important.

Find what looks good on you.,
Watch a few Audrey Hepburn films for an idea of her elegance and styles.,
Keep your choices simple.,
Avoid following trends.,
Pay close attention to your grooming.,
Consider Audrey Hepburn's basics as possible basics for your wardrobe.,
Consider casual wear as Audrey wore it.,
Select some suitable accessories.,
Maintain good posture.",How to Have an Audrey Hepburn Influenced Style," From an early age, Audrey had a clear mind as to what looked good on her and she stayed true to her own style all her life, even arguing gently but stubbornly with those who saw fit to request otherwise.She had a dancer's eye for self-knowledge, knowing both her finer points and her lesser ones. She wasn't afraid to acknowledge what didn't work for her as much as what did. And it's good for you too to find your faults, because we all have them. But also find at least one thing about you that you really want to accentuate and love about yourself. With Audrey it was her daunting 22 inch (55.9 cm) waist.She wore clothing cinched at the waist to show it off, and enhancing is what you should do with whatever you like about your body.



Tailored clothing looks great because it is made to fit you. Consider having some classic, timeless clothes tailored individually for you; the difference in how the clothes sit on you is simply remarkable.;
, Her defining movie is Breakfast at Tiffany's,a film in which you can see many elegant shots of Audrey. Other good films for fashion ideas include Sabrina, Paris When it Sizzles, Funny Face, Charade, and Roman Holiday. Also, read some of the many books dedicated to discussing and showing Audrey Hepburn's style. A lot of them will give you a good idea of the types of clothes she wore, her general style, and how she accessorized.


Another good way to get a feel for Audrey's style is to also focus on her philosophy of life. Do this by reading biographies about Audrey Hepburn and read the many quotes attributed to her. Audrey believed most in the power of love over everything else, and that gave her an inner strength guided her through life constantly and even impacted her style choices., Audrey never liked things to be complicated, including fashion and ""less is more"" was her key belief.Indeed, she once said: ""Boil it all down to what counts the most: What is the essence of what you are trying to do, what is the most important thing? Things only get complicated when you try to address too many issues.""Her match with Givenchy was a reflection of her preference for simple clothing and even today Givenchy clothing is known for its elegance, simplicity, and line.Think ""elegant simplicity"" when putting your look together.

, There is no need to be swayed by trends when you're already certain of your personal style. Audrey wasn't swayed by trends and indeed, her sense of timelessness came from her belief in quality before all else. Sean Hepburn Ferrer said that the reason Audrey has remained an icon to this day is because she stayed with her look all her life once she found it and didn't reinvent herself every season.While Audrey loved fashion, she used it as a tool to complement her looks, rather than letting fashion use her. So in your own case, stick with the classics that you know work for you and perhaps give a glance at trends by the simple addition of a colored brooch or a scarf that reflects the color scheme of the day but no more – use seasonal changes as the accessory, not as an enslavement to trends. The exception to this rule is where a trend happens to coincide with your personal style and does look good on you; in that case, buy up!


Audrey was no stranger to avoiding trends. Not only did she not jump into the latest fashion trends but she was also somewhat unique for her time. Up against icons like Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield, who were buxom and blond, Audrey was gamine, waif, thin, brunette, and decidedly flat-chested. Her response was to make the most of what she had and to accentuate it!

, Audrey's look was always unmistakably well groomed and neat. Her love of simplicity extended to ensuring that she appeared simply made up even though quite a lot of effort had gone into achieving this look. For a simple but effective look, concentrate on caring well for your hair and getting it cut regularly. Select a hairstyle that suits you and revise the look as you age. Don't be afraid to wear a style that isn't current; provided it looks good on you, that's what counts.


The first thing people notice is how you look. As such, flawless skin, manicured nails, and well-groomed hair all matter for first impressions.
Looking good helps you to feel good too. Dressing well for even a trip to the supermarket can give you an air of confidence that helps you interact well with others.
Take good care of your clothes. Buy quality and keep them in good shape with careful washing and by following the care instructions on their labels. Keep them well pressed and stored.
Audrey believed in buying shoes a half size bigger rather than smaller so that they did not deform over time or hurt the feet., There were some items of clothing that Audrey always considered essential. They may or may not form a part of your wardrobe, but it's worth considering them at least:

The white shirt: Audrey wore a white shirt in the movie Roman Holiday. After this, it became a classic in women's wear. The best white shirt is button-up, plain, and without embellishments. Audrey used to tie hers at the waist for a tiny look. It can be worn for work with a blazer thrown over it, worn with the sleeves rolled up for relaxing, or worn with a skirt and heels for a dinner outing.
A pair of kitten heels: Audrey's heels were short and elegant. At 5"" 7, Audrey felt herself taller than many actors of the time and didn't wish to accentuate her height. Her choice of kitten heels simply added to her elegance and what's more, medical specialists tell women that the safest height for heels is kitten heel height!A pair of flats: Audrey's initial dream was to be a ballerina.Circumstances prevented her from achieving this dream but she did carry over some of the ballerina style into her daily wear, and ballet flats were definitely one of these choices. Flats can go with many clothes, including pants and full skirts. They're also great for height reduction if that's an issue for you.
A fitted suit: Chic fitted suits were another one of Audrey's trademarks. One very good quality suit can be mixed and matched with a range of your other clothing pieces.
The little black dress: It was Audrey who introduced this to us, both in the films Sabrina and Breakfast at Tiffany's, showing its enduring importance as a fashion icon to this day. Her Givenchy black dress from Breakfast in Tiffany's sold for nearly half a million pounds in 2006.Now an absolute essential in any woman's wardrobe, the LBD is best plain but dressed up with accompanying items. For more details, see How to dress up that little black dress.







, When Audrey was spending time with her children, gardening or playing with her dogs, she dressed very casually but her relaxing wear was still defined by a mark of elegance as well as comfort.

Audrey preferred jeans, slacks, Capri pants, or khakis to skirts. For jeans, either a skinny fit or a bootcut fit work well. She preferred dark, classic denim, but that's because it worked for her, so be sure to find a shade of denim that works for you. As for khakis, Audrey wore the slim fit, and this looks good on mostly everyone; all the same, be sure to find a length that works for you.






When it comes to tops, she preferred polos, turtlenecks (black), button down shirts, or t-shirts. She liked them in a solid color (her favorite was white) and without any logos or print. Find a color that goes well with your skin tone and hair color.
As for shoes, a pair of ballet flats, sneakers, or Italian driving shoes (she liked Ferragamo) are perfect. They come in many shades and patterns, so find one that is versatile and that you like. Just be aware that Ferragamo shoes are not cheap! But most importantly, never, ever skimp on quality and always think about comfort. It's better to have one pair of sturdy shoes than many that are uncomfortable and easily fall apart.

, There are a few accessories that defined Audrey Hepburn's style, as follows:

A scarf: You can wear a scarf in so many ways that it's impossible to list them all. If you have one shirt and seventeen scarves, you really have more than seventeen shirts! Try silk scarves for summer and cashmere scarves for winter.






Dark sunglasses: These look good on everyone and are perfect for your gloomy, ""I didn't get enough sleep"" days.
Long evening gloves: For special glamor at night, why not wear a pair of long evening gloves with your evening dress?

Pearls: A quality pearl necklace is an essential in your jewelry box. Avoid overly large pieces or fake pearls; buy a pair of small pearl earrings over of a pair of huge fake ones. In Breakfast at Tiffany's you can get a sense of a very glamorous look of Audrey's character's Holly Golightly's jewelry; in real life however, Audrey tended to prefer a simple set of studs and not too much daily adornment.

, As well as clothes and accessories, posture does a great deal for your appearance. Audrey's ballet training taught her to never look sloppy and to always appear graceful, even when relaxing. Audrey said that ""dancers do a lot of technical things out of good habit. When we relax we never get sloppy""and she carried this gracefulness across to all aspects of her life. Carry yourself gracefully and with good posture in mind and you'll carry off any look successfully, especially when accompanied by a positive attitude about your life.


Standing up straight makes both you and your clothes look better.

She is truthful and tells things how they are. Sometimes, this gets her into trouble. Being honest is a good thing, but some people have troubles hearing the truth. If you have a friend who values honesty, but is also very sensitive, you may have to learn how to say things in a kinder way. For example:


Your friend is about to buy a dress, and it is very ugly. She wants your opinion of it. Instead of saying that it is ugly, you could say: I don't think pink is your color—but what about this blue dress? It'll help bring out your eyes, and the cut is great for you.;
, Applejack, and the rest of the Apple family, are all very close and family-oriented. They spend time with each other, and help one another out. Even if they get into fights, they are quick to make up and forgive. Family often comes first for Applejack.


The Apple family values their traditions, and tries to keep them alive.

, Applejack is always competing against Rainbow Dash, but in a friendly sort of way. She also tries to keep her competitions as fair and honest as possible. When you get the chance to compete for something you are good at, don't back down. Just remember: be a good sport about it, and play it fair. Don't ever cheat.

, Applejack is known for her skill for ""bucking"" apples off a tree, but this might not be possible for everyone. Instead, why don't you try in signing up for sports that test your strength and endurance, such as basketball, track, or swimming?

, Applejack is not a cake decorator like Pinkie Pie, but she does know a thing or two about baking—especially when it comes to apple-related goods. Try learning and perfecting some popular apple-based treats, such as apple pie and apple strudel.Family traditions are important to Applejack. If your family has some special recipes, try learning them.

, Applejack lives in a farm. Unfortunately, not everyone can do that, so a small garden will be the closest thing for some people. Ask your parents if you can have a plot in the backyard, and grow some vegetables, such as carrots, cucumbers, lettuce, and tomatoes. You can also try your hand on herbs, such as basil, mint, and thyme.


If you live in an apartment, start an herb garden in a flower pot.

, Applejack values hard, honest work. She'd rather work hard, take her time, and do a good job than take the easy way out, and end up with something sloppy. She is also the type of gal who'd fix her own things when they break, and not cringe if she gets mud on her.


Applejack also loves the outdoors and going camping. She'd be the first to help pitch the tent and gather wood for the campfire.

, These are some of Applejack's flaws, and they're not ones you'd want to copy. Applejack is proud, and very stubborn. She wants to do everything on her own, and often ends up overworking herself. Many of her episodes end in Applejack learning that it's okay to ask for help, such as ""Applebuck Season,"" from season 1.It's okay to know what you want, but you shouldn't reject your friends when they offer to help.
Don't pile too much on your plate. Applejack tends to this too often, and almost always regrets it.

, This is Applejack's trademark accessory. She wears one even to formal events, much to Rarity's shock and dismay. Look for something made from felt, leather, or straw.

, Applejack lives on a farm, so she can't wear many pretty, fancy things. She wears mostly ""work duds,"" as she likes to call them. If you'd like to give off the Applejack vibes, choose clothes that you can work in, and that you won't mind getting dirty. For example:


Cowboy hats and boots
Bandanas tied around the neck
Jeans and jean skirts
Plaid or cotton button up blouses
Vests

, Orange is Applejack's body color, but many of her outfits include the colors red and green. To keep yourself from looking too Christmasy, however, try to use a more orangey red, and a lighter, yellow-toned green.

, Applejack is a tomboy. She works hard on the farm all day, and doesn't have time to put makeup. She's also not interested in impressing anyone with her looks. If you must wear makeup, go for a natural, barely-there look with neutral colors, such as creams and browns.

, Applejack is an easy going gal, so a low ponytail is enough for her. It keeps her hair out of the way while she works. Most importantly of all, it does not get in the way of her beloved cowboy hat.


If you want to look more like Applejack, straighten your hair. Both her human and pony versions have straight hair/mane/tail.
If you want to be like Applejack, then keep your natural hair texture. Applejack is a simple pony, and doesn't have the time to get fancy and straighten her hair.
Consider dyeing your hair blonde or getting a wig if this is for a costume.

, Red or green apples will do. Applejack's cutie mark is three red apples, but many of her outfits also feature green apples. Try adding an apple-shaped patch to your jeans, vest, or backpack.

Don’t let anyone stop you.",How to Look Like Marilyn Monroe," Marilyn Monroe is known for her gorgeous, sexy dresses, and if you want to look like her, then you have to get comfortable with wearing them as often as you can. In general, her dresses served to emphasize her hourglass figure, often with a more low-cut look and a belt around her waist. Here are some dresses that you can try for inspiration:


A halter neck dress. This dress is Marilyn’s most famous, known for its appearance in The Seven Year Itch. This dress was white, with a full skirt with ruffles beneath it, that looked gorgeous when it blew in the wind, exposing her legs.
Strapless dresses
Dresses with sweetheart necklines to emphasize your bust
Red dresses. She is known for her red dresses that match the color of her lips, whether they are strapless, halters, or have sleeves that fall off the shoulder.
White or silver dresses with ruffles. Marilyn loved wearing these classy colors, and often wears white strapless dresses or dresses with clear sleeves with ruffles in the skirt. Add some sequins to your dress for a more glamorous look.
Though Marilyn mostly stuck to solid color dresses, she sometimes wore dresses with polka dots or red flowers on them. She was also known for wearing stripes.;
, Though you may think of Marilyn Monroe as always dressed up to the nines, she liked to look more casual, on occasion. You can’t always be dressed up, and for the days when you feel like having a more casual night in, you can rock her casual style while maintaining your aura of sexiness. Here are some looks you can try:


High waisted blue jeans paired with a white button-down shirt
A thick, woven oversized sweater
A jean jacket
A simple black turtleneck
A black-and-white striped turtleneck t-shirt
A simple red-and-white striped collared button-down shirt
A high-necked long-sleeved orange t-shirt
Black checkered pants

, Though her favorite shoe designer was Salvatore Ferragamo, you don’t need to wear such luxurious shoes. All you have to do is wear shoes that Marilyn was likely to wear. She is known for some of the following shoes:Peep-toe high heeled shoes, in cream or white
Black strappy stiletto heels
Cream ballet flats
Traditional cream-colored close-toed heels
Chunky black heels
Brown heels with white straps
Red heels with sequins
White kitten heels

, Marilyn wore beige, brown, black, cream, forest green, and white — sticking mostly to champagne colours — while avoiding all bright colours except red. It may also help you to know that her favourite store was Bloomingdales, and her favourite designer was Emilio Pucci. However, you don’t have to wear designer clothes to really look like Marilyn; tasteful imitations will do.


You can mix it up and wear solids as well as striped or patterned colors.

, If you want to complete her look, then you should also wear some accessories that are reminiscent of Marilyn. This can help you tie your look together and be sexy and mysterious all at once. Here are some additional features you can try:


A thick belt worn high around your waist
A thin pink kerchief tied around your head
Black glasses that are pointed around the outsides of your eyes
A white fur wrap to add a touch of glamour to any dress
A white, wide-brimmed beach hat
White sleeves around your forearms only

, If you want to look like Marilyn, then you should have everyday Marilyn clothes, if you can imagine such a thing, to complete your look any day of the week. Here are some of the things you should own if you want to really look like Marilyn Monroe:


The classic one-piece strapless white bathing suit
Pencil skirts in different colors
A pair of high white slacks
A bullet bra to get her 50s “sweater girl” look
Items with bows on them

, Marilyn knew that no glamorous look is complete without jewels. If you want to look like Marilyn, then you can go for simple, classic jewelry, such as a strand or pearl necklace, a pair of chandelier earrings, or simple studs in the ears with a more elaborate necklace. The important thing is that you look classy but you don’t overdo it.


Sometimes Marilyn did wear more dramatic jewelry, such as a chunky orange necklace.
She was also seen wearing the occasional silver bangles.

, Now, Marilyn Monroe herself was not a natural blonde. Though you don’t have to change your color or believe that “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,” you can do this if you’re really committed to the Marilyn look. Aim for golden blonde locks before you style your hair the Marilyn way.


Though her brown-haired days are lesser known, a younger Marilyn did sport her natural brown locks with more frizzy, compact curls, and looked cute and natural. She also did wear her brown hair nearly straight and past her shoulders once upon a time.

, If you really want to have hair like Marilyn’s, then you should get a layered, shoulder length cut, with shorter layers in the front and longer layers in the back. Once you’ve got this look down, you can give your hair extra volume by combing some gel into it while it’s damp and then blow-drying it dry in sections. If your hair is more curly, then you may want to straighten it a bit first.


Once your hair is dry, you should separate it in sections and spray each section with spray gel, and then set it in hot rollers. Once the rollers have set, you can remove them and brush your hair out, in a forward direction, and then add a bit more hairspray under your layers.
Marilyn Monroe didn’t have bangs. However, she did have a chunk of hair in a wave over her forehead.
For extra bounce, flip your hair back and then work a bit of styling cream through it.
Unlike today’s celebrities, Marilyn Monroe didn’t change her hair style, color, or length every other week. Her hair was pretty much always blonde and curly, falling just below her ears in the front and just above her neck in the back. However, she did experiment a bit with how curly it was, and sometimes had it more coiled and shorter and sometimes a bit longer and more wavy.

, Marilyn's makeup artist, Whitney Snyder, claims that Marilyn often wore thick layers of Vaseline on her face to both soften her skin and give it a glow. Though this is a bit extreme and can lead to dry skin, she was also said to wash her face up to fifteen times a day, in order to avoid getting any spots. She also used Nivea Moisturizer. If you want to get that Marilyn look, then you should maintain clear, soft skin.


Marilyn Monroe was a bit on the pale side. If you’d like to stay true to her look, you can avoid getting overly tan. But if you have darker skin, you can rock her vintage look too!
For beautiful looking skin, apply some foundation to your face and then cover it with luminous face powder. Marilyn used products by Anita of Denmark and Erno Laszlo, but you can find the products that work best for you.

, To get the Marilyn Monroe signature lips, you should apply several coats of crimson or red lipstick to your lips. The closest lipstick color to the shade that Marilyn Monroe used available today is Guerlain Kiss Kiss Lipstick, #522. Sometimes she wore a darker red shade, while other times she opted for a lighter, more peach-colored red. Find the best lipstick for your skin tone and for the occasion.


Marilyn Monroe had full, luscious lips. Use a bit of lip-liner to accentuate your lips to make your top lip as full and luscious as your bottom lip.
Sometimes, she exaggerated the cleft in her top lip, so you can exaggerate yours, too, with the help of some lip-liner. You can even add a bit of foundation to the center of your top lip for this effect.

, If you want to get those gorgeous Marilyn Monroe eyes, then you need to apply three shades of eyeshadow to your eyes. Apply one darker shade in the crease of your eye, a lighter one over your lids, and then a very light shade above the lid-crease and to the brow. She often used a light blue or a peach shade on her eyelids, sometimes looking like she was barely wearing any eyeshadow at all.Apply at least one or two coats of lash-lengthening black mascara to your eyes. Marilyn was known for her long lashes. You can even opt for fake lashes for fun, or use an eyelash curler to make those lashes more dramatic.
A bit of black eyeliner along the top eyelid can also help emphasize your eyes. Though Marilyn didn’t tend to wear eyeliner on her bottom lid, just brushing a touch of brown eyeshadow below the bottom lid can emphasize your eyes.

, Marilyn Monroe’s eyebrows have a high, dramatic arch and are set fairly far apart on her face. Her brows are pretty thin, though they are a bit thicker closer to her nose, thinning out a bit after the arch, which falls just above the outsides of both of her eyes. Use tweezers to get the dramatic arch of her eyebrows down, which look not curved but like two lines meeting, and use lighter brown eyebrow pencil to fill them in.


A younger Marilyn had more curved brows, if you’re more interested in that look.

, Marilyn Monroe is known for her gorgeous beauty mark, located a few inches above the left end of her lips. You can use a brown eyeliner to pencil it in. Though you can also buy a fake beauty mark, you’re better off drawing it on yourself. Just take care not to wipe it off and check on your face throughout the day.

, Marilyn was often seen wearing nail polish that matched her red lips. Apply red nail polish to those nails, making sure you pick a shade that is as close as possible to the color of your lips. You can opt for fake nails or work to develop longer, smooth nails to rock her look.

, 5 perfume. This was said to be her favorite perfume. She once said, “What do I wear in bed? Why, Chanel No. 5, of course.” She was also said to enjoy Fracas and Joy perfumes., Marilyn Monroe had what was considered a curvy figure in her day and wasn’t afraid to own it. Though her weight fluctuated between about 115 lbs-140 lbs, she was said to generally measure around 37-23-37, at 5 feet (1.5 m), 5 inches (12.7 cm) tall, with a bra size of a 36D. Unfortunately, though you may have heard she would be a size 12-16 today, with today’s sizes, she would be more of a size 4-6. She looked absolutely gorgeous at this size, and you shouldn’t try to mimic it, but rather, work to be proud of your body and your curves.Stay healthy and happy with your body by doing at least 30 minutes of exercise a day, whether you’re jogging or doing yoga.
Do dumbbell exercises daily to keep your arms toned. Every morning except for Sundays, Marilyn would workout using ""bust-firming"" moves with her 3-pound dumb-bells.
You can try eating like Marilyn on occasion, if you want to see what it was like. She would drink a cup of warm milk with 2 raw eggs whipped together in the milk for breakfast and claimed to eat steak, beef, or liver with at least 10 raw carrots for dinner. During the day she would mostly snack on fruit and veggies. After evening drama classes, she went out for hot-fudge sundaes.
Try taking ice-baths, if you can stand it. This will instantly firm up your body. Marilyn did this before her birthday song for John F. Kennedy. She actually took them quite regularly.
Marilyn was known for her curves. If you're not curvy yourself, work to create the illusion with your clothes, including padded bras and girdles. For example, a belt cinched in around your waist will instantly give you a sexy, hourglass shape.

, Marilyn Monroe is an icon known for her extreme sexiness. While you don’t have to take it this far, you should work to be a bit playful and sexy, if you want to be more like Marilyn. This doesn’t mean you should wear completely revealing clothes, but that you should show off a little leg or shoulder and not be afraid to flaunt what you’ve got.


To have sex appeal, you don’t put it all out there at once. You smile, you bat your eyes a little, you look down at the floor to be a bit coy and then straight ahead to show how confident you are. You have to know how sexy you are before other people believe it.
Part of Marilyn’s sex appeal is in her mixture of sex goddess aura as well as her innocence. You don’t need to be too forward to be sexy like Marilyn.
She was also a bit of a goofball, especially in movies like The Seven Year Itch. Don’t think that you have to be serious all the time to be sexy. Some of her sexiness lies in her silly nature.
Work on developing a low, sensual, and breathy voice. Marilyn had a very seductive voice. If you like, you can try slipping some of her sayings, such as, ""Isn't it wonderful,” into your daily conversations.

, To complete the Marilyn look, you have to show how confident you are about who you are and how you look. Don’t worry about what other people think about you and be happy doing your own thing, whether this means dating a baseball player or dancing the tango. The most important thing is that you believe in who you are and don’t let gossip or rumors make you feel bad about yourself.


Walk with a seductive wiggle in your hips, by placing one foot in front of the other. Use body language to show how confident you are.
Keep a smile on your face, even if you’re having a bad day. Work to cultivate optimism and a positive energy will radiate around you, just as it did with Marilyn. She didn’t have the easiest life, but she tried to stay upbeat in spite of the challenges she faced.

, Marilyn Monroe grew up with a mentally unstable mother who had her living with a series of foster parents; she never knew her father. She began working in a munitions factory after high school, spraying airplane parts and inspecting parachutes, before she was discovered for her beauty. She had three tumultuous marriages and many more affairs, and yet, she continued to perform, to sing, to dance, and to light up the stage. If you want to rock her attitude, then you have to keep going in spite of the hardship.

If Marilyn had listened to the people who told her she would be better off as a secretary than trying to make it on the big screen, then she wouldn't have gotten anywhere. Adopt her can-do attitude and know that the sky’s the limit.

This requires showing an interest in others, listening carefully and reflecting back that you've heard them, all the while observing their body language and demeanor. A good listener is a flatterer and charm is all about flattery.


Improve your people skills if they're not already top notch by learning the art of conversation, the intricacies of small talk and the skill of active listening. Improve your ability to read body language. And learn to read between the lines, to understand that the things that people aren't saying are just as important as what they actually say. You can learn and master every single one of these skills if you're determined.

Improve your wit. 007 can always turn a bad situation into a funny one. Wit is a game of skill, so if you haven't got it yet, practice Bond's lines and branch out with your own when you feel comfortable. The internet has many examples of witticisms you can ""borrow"" until it feels more natural.
Learn how to speak some of the basics of the more popular languages; knowing other languages will open more doors around the world and keep you culturally attuned. If nothing else, be able to say ""Hello"" and ""How are you?"" in the world's most prominent languages: Mandarin, Arabic, Spanish, French, Russian and German.

Tell good stories. Bond is a storyteller, in the tradition of all charismatic persons. Storytelling is a skill, just as good conversational skills are; it's about taking the listener to a place or situation filled with interest, intrigue, dynamism and excitement. Use strong verbs, descriptive language and leave out the boring details that hold the story back.;
, Bond is rarely disheveled, for he takes pride in the appearance that he presents. Whether it's formal or casual, his clothing is of good quality, well pressed and tailored to fit. If you can't afford tailoring, don't despair — it's about trying clothing on for fit and ignoring the sizing — brands vary so much by sizes but the test of truth is in trying the outfits on and going by feel and look. If the item sits well on you, then it's something that will bring confidence and comfort for you; if it's baggy, too tight or looks like something your grandfather might have worn, don't even think about it. Good grooming includes paying attention to the following:



Iron your clothes before wearing. Pressed clothing always gives the impression of a man who cares about his appearance.

Polish your shoes. If they're the type of shoe that requires polishing, keep them polished regularly. Shoes that can't be polished should be clean, neat and regularly maintained.
If you wear a tie, don't make a statement with it — avoid loud colors, childish or frantic patterns, and unusual widths. Keep it understated and matching with your outfit: cool, calm, and collected.
If you wear accessories, such as a watch or a shirt pocket handkerchief, ensure that they're of top quality. People notice these things immediately because they stand out. You want to be judged by others as tasteful and time-tested.

, As a spy, Bond has ample opportunities to be daring. You may not be a spy, but you will have opportunities in life to show courage and to take reasonable risks. Life is a balance of risk and caution. Know when it's reasonable to risk it, and when it's reasonable to withdraw back to safety. Step outside of your comfort zone now and then, and try new adventures regularly to stay engaged with all life has to offer.


Talk to a lady with exuberant confidence and deadpan delivery. Does Bond worry about rejection? You can bet your tail he doesn't. Don't go into the conversation expecting anything. If she's interested, your boldness will have been rewarded. If she's not, your ego needs nothing more than a smoky, peaty scotch to soothe its temporary bruise.
Consider asking for a raise. 007 knows how much he's worth. Do you? If you've been working at your company for more than a year without even a nominal raise, think about having a chat with your boss. Understand what you are doing before you try to negotiate a raise; you might not get what you want. But nothing ventured, nothing gained. Right Mr. Bond?
Flirt with disaster (in a safe way). Have you ever been skydiving or bungee jumping? How about race car driving? Consider doing any of the above with an experienced professional. When put between a rock and a hard place, Bond merely shoots out of the tangle at incredibly fast speeds. You might, too.

, Bond doesn't do complicated. Whether it's his work, his relationships or his life in general, he aims to sort things out so that they're simple enough without being too simple. If you don't want long-term relationships, be open about this from the beginning — it's unkind to leave people dangling and it's going to complicate things too much for you if you're not clear. As for your work life, avoid entangling yourself with office politics as much as possible because it makes matters unnecessarily messy, distracting you from getting on with what really matters.



Be sophisticated while remaining uncomplicated. Choose the best and discard the rest — you don't need those dollar store or sale table bargains. One coat will do instead of a whole wardrobe filled with sales knock-offs. One French champagne is better than a dozen sparkling wines from the specials bin.
Familiarize yourself with the top-shelf. You don't have to be bleeding cash to taste a little bit of the good life. Treat yourself every once in a while to the very best, the crème de la crème, of life. Save and skimp for a while so you know what it's like to taste Johnny Walker Blue Label, or what it's like to wear a Patek Philippe watch.
If you can afford expensive cars and gadgets, keep these uncomplicated too. One beautiful car to lavish your attention on is sufficient — a garage full of them is just boastful and time-sapping. Ditto the gadgets — just how many can you play with in a day? Keep it real.

, You might not be able to jet off to Monte Carlo or live it up in Rio during the carnival, but you can avail yourself of beautiful places near you. Choose places that are naturally beautiful, such as beaches, local forests, or mountains near your locale; spend time relaxing in nature with your loved ones. Whether you're camping or staying in a five star resort, you can make the most of the world's beauty by appreciating it and making it the backdrop for your vacation activities, just as Bond would do.

, Self-defense is the the art of getting out of fights as much as possible and engaging when there's no other choice. In the case of actual engagement, good self-defense skills will enable you to disarm an opponent, not simply through force, but also through anticipation and focus. A Martial art is highly recommended because you'll learn the skills of reading people, staying aware, avoiding combat and engaging artfully when the need arises. Martial arts also help to increase confidence and maintain flexibility of both body and mind.



Stay fit. Your primary defense is fitness, an ability to move agilely, to run fast, to react quickly, etc. Bond is always in good shape through daily exercise and workouts, a healthy habit to adopt in your life too.
Improve your street smarts. Be more alert and aware of your surroundings — look around and think ahead to see the things that others don't. Always be thinking one or more steps ahead of others around you, asking yourself ""if this happens, then…"". Notice things that are out of context or out of character and be alert for what this may mean. Again, noticing more about the people and world around you is a skill you can hone.

Swim. Bond is a brilliant swimmer, both distance and underwater. Swimming is great all-round fitness and who knows when you might need to swim for any length of time to escape your foes?

, Bond knows that women are his equal and can hold their own in any situation. Treat women with respect wherever you go; this mantra is important both for forming solid and loyal relationships, but also maintaining healthy self-esteem. A man with good self-esteem doesn't need to put down women to feel better.


Be a gentleman through and through. Hold the door open for her when she's nearby. Avoid barbaric displays of swearing or hooliganism. Be warm and inviting to her mother — you'll be happy you did.

, Bond upgrades as often as possible, keeping abreast of all the new developments. He isn't threatened by change but embraces it willingly, often with gusto. You will find the world a less threatening place when you're prepared to acknowledge that life keeps changing and when you're willing to give new things a go and bring them into your own life.


Read the newspaper every day. Aim for a newspaper with an international feel, so that you can learn about developments around the world. Special interest and lifestyle should take a necessary back seat to politics and world news.
Make friends in high places. Not only will friends in high places benefit your career and your social life, they might make you privy to certain information that won't appear in newspapers and news sources. And while you're probably not going to need the information for spying or selling government secrets, they do make great cocktail stories.

, Bond thrives on quality food — fast food outlets are not his style. Healthy, unprocessed food is a source of good energy, brain power and longevity. As for drinks, be a connoisseur of alcoholic drinks, not a guzzler. Bond enjoys a refreshing drink here and there (in particular, the famous shaken-not-stirred vodka martini). Yet, he doesn't over-indulge as a rule. Staying alert and healthy requires taking a sensible approach to alcohol.


Have a go-to cocktail that you can call your own. You don't need to guzzle martinis like it's Prohibition, but you should know what you like to drink and which drinks like you. That way, you can fire off a request to the bartender tout suite and start scoping the scene for villains or vixens.
If you don't know how to cook, start learning. It's yet another skill that is easy to learn when you put your mind to it. Cooking frees you from relying on others to produce your meal, as well. Best of all, cooking will keep you healthy and fed wherever you may find yourself.

Eat with etiquette. Know how to hold the cutlery, chopsticks, etc. and know how to deal with fiddly or sloppy food so that you don't make a mess. Chew with your mouth closed and avoid making eating noises. And keep your elbows off the table.
Be hospitable. Always be ready to pop the bubbly and throw an event to entertain your friends. Whether you're rich or not-so-rich, there is always time for sharing food and good conversation with friends.

, Bond always has a Plan B, whether it's a spy mission, a confrontation with the boss or a date. There's no need to vocalize your changed intentions––Bond doesn't do that, he just gets on with things as needed, to sort out a bad situation and make it good again. And apply common sense to all that you do, just as Bond would.

, A good memory makes the world your oyster, just as Bond proves. It enables you to remember all the small details about people, the conversations you've had and the experiences you've lived through in intimate detail. Knowledge is power and memory is the way to retain that knowledge and keep hold of that power. A good memory is something Bond treasures, as it enables him to speak different languages, keep tabs on the people he meets again throughout his life, and harness the processing power to crack tricky puzzles.


Play memory games when you can. Use mnemonic devices to assist in your quest to strengthen your memory: Limericks, acrostics, and acronyms are all helpful in making you a memory savant.
Sleep enough, eat healthy, and keep stress levels low. Sleep helps you boost your memory, as can certain omega-3 foods and antioxidants.Stress destroys brain cells and negatively affects the hippocampus, an area in the brain involved in memory formation and retrieval. Get good sleep when you aren't saving the world; treat yourself to a hearty salmon fillet with spinach at your finest establishment; and don't stress too much about the Russian oligarchs trying to disrupt the balance of world power.

, Even though Bond may seem free and loose with his loving ways, he is capable of nurturing love, which the case of Vesper Lynd makes clear. Treasure the people you love and care about. Realize that these people are the ones who make life what it really is — all the fast cars, sleek gadgets and chic lifestyles cannot replace the love and friendship of those who trust you and are always there for you.

First of all, Massie doesn't go shopping by herself.,
Gasp!,
Go into Gucci, Prada, buy things like a pair of D&G sunglasses or a Juicy Couture bag (only if you live near one, like in New York City).,
Go into Hollister Co., Abercrombie and Fitch, Aerie, Juicy Couture, H&M, Aeropostale, etc.,
Don't buy something you hate, just because it's materialistic.,
Go to the spa with your friends; get a manicure, but no pedicures.,
Go back to your house and make face masks and stuff.,
Go to the hairdresser daily.,
Post your outfits before you wear them on polyvore.com.",How to Go for a Shopping Trip Like Massie Block," Go with your friends, or even your mom .. as long as she's got style that makes that song, ""I got it from my Mama"" true! Don't buy the same things as your friends, because then it just looks like a uniform, and you don't want that .. and looking like your betas? Well, that's not the best idea.;
, Turns out your friends can't go shopping today! Well, hold it for a minute. Maybe you can bring another person .. maybe from another group that you've been meaning to hang out with (be a social butterfly, obviously!) or go shopping with your gorgeous cousins .. you can trick the crowd, can't you?

, Something, even just a small signature like Chanel No. 5 perfume! You don't need to buy any of this, because it's extremely expensive, but it's nice to wear something like that. Don't buy knock-offs, people will know. Especially not Fuggs .. those are so obvious, and those are starting to get out of style, anyway! And by Fuggs that means the kind that look exactly like Uggs but without the Ugg tag.

, They have really cute clothes that you can mix-and-match into a 10.


Avoid clothes with big logos across the chest as those can very easily turn tacky.

, Try on outfits, and make sure that it's not like, a one hundred dollar tee shirt. Buy fleeces and classics at Abercrombie; and find accessories that look like it's a whole new outfit when you wear it a few times in the future.

, Those places have diseases, or so we've heard, only get a pedi at a non-second hand spas. Second hand spa's are not good quality. More gossip points for you, if you let your friends know about someone who got foot fungus there! Get your eyebrows waxed, too. Make the girls see that you're brave, obviously!

, Make it an at home spa, too. I know, we all want an at-home spa like Massie does, but we probably can't afford that, can we? Get a few massages, or ask your mom if you can hire someone for the day to come to your house as a special treat, and, with your friends, get awesome, relaxing massages!

, Get different, all the rage hair styles. Nothing too short, but something that makes your hair fresh, clean, bouncy, and has lots of volume. Ask for the greatest products that will keep your hair smelling delicious, and so it'll look shiny, glossy, and smooth!

, That way people can rate them to make sure they're fabulous and alpha-licious.

Speak with up-talk.,
Use slang when you talk.,
Express your attitude in your voice.,
Talk on the phone.",How to Act Like Cher from Clueless1," Up-talk refers to the high-rising intonation that occurs at the end of speech. It's commonly thought to have become popular back in the 1980s by valley girls living in Southern California. The movie Clueless's characters, including Cher, exaggerate and exemplify the stereotypes of this speech pattern. Chances are you already do this in your speech (try listening to how your voice naturally rises in pitch whenever you ask a question, particularly one that seeks agreement), but you can also study and learn how to actively mimic the speech pattern by watching the movie.Up-talk typically makes statements sound like questions. An example of a conversation with a speaker who uses up talk might sound like the following: ""Hi, Mary? This is Shannon? From your Algebra 2 class? I wanted to let you know, I found your cell phone? I brought it home with me, you can get it from me at school tomorrow? Okay, bye?"";
, You'll probably notice that Cher and her friends have a very particular way of speaking. It's peppered with ""Valspeak,"" which is an American slang that originated from Southern California's valley girls. If you really want to sound like Cher, you'll need to use and understand her lingo, which includes terms and phrases like ""as if,"" ""whatever,"" and ""duh"" among others.When answering a question that you feel the answer is obvious, like ""Did you do well on your science test?"" respond with, ""Well, duh!""
When someone makes a rude joke and you can't think of a good comeback, instead of dignifying it, respond with a sarcastic ""Whatever"" to dismiss it.
If you and your friend see a handsome guy around, you can say ""Like, oh my God, he's a total Baldwin!"" to express how incredibly hot he is.

, One thing you will probably notice is that no matter what Cher says, she sounds very expressive. When she says ""whatever,"" it comes with a sigh and a tone of disgust; her ""totally""s are enthusiastic and chipper. If you want to sound like Cher, you will need to let your tone of voice help you to express the extent to which you mean what you say.

, In many of the scenes from the movie and promotional materials you can see Cher and her friends on their cell phones. For valley girls, cell phones are basically another accessory that they keep on their person at all times. Cher even uses it to talk to her best friend when she's right next to her, so be sure to use your phone to talk with people important to you as much as possible."

Dress preppy.,
Invest in designer clothing.,
Wear a lot of plaid.,
Dress to impress.",How to Act Like Cher from Clueless2," Cher's dress style was definitively preppy, polished, and clean.Luckily, the essential items for a good, preppy styled wardrobe haven't changed too much over the years. If you invest in them and wear them regularly, you'll have taken your first step in the right direction. These include:Feminine blouses
Opaque tights
Blazers
Thin sweaters
Feminine headbands
Mary Jane heels
Pearl jewelry and/or statement necklaces
Sheath dresses
Skirts in A-line, skater, or pencil cuts
Ballet flats
Stylish pea coats or cape-style coats
Patterned cardigans
Skinny belts
Skinny colored pants

, Cher had money, and if you listened to her talk, it was obvious that it mattered to her what brands she was buying. Some of the best-known preppy labels include Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, and J. Crew.However, other high end fashion labels like Burberry, Versace, Gucci, and Chanel are also synonymous with quality design and high price tags. They would have been exactly the kind of thing that Cher would have bought.Because designer clothing can be very expensive, it may not be within everyone's means to shop these brands at full retail price. Try saving your money and buying during sales times and/or buying from upscale second-hand clothing stores.

, Plaid is a very preppy print. It's also a very Clueless print: 53 different plaid patterns were used throughout the course of the film. So whether it's your skirt, pants, blazer or blouse, you can't go wrong if it's plaid.Sometimes you can even find plaid accessories, like a phone case, headband, or even shoes.
Plaid comes in a variety of colors, as items for both men and women, and can be worn with anything from denim to tights or maxi skirts.A sharp, bright plaid pattern is a great way to help an otherwise boring outfit pop.

, Even if you can't invest in brand new clothing from designer labels or choose not to dress preppy, you should always try to look your best. If you watch Clueless, Cher never left her house looking sloppy, dirty, or messy. Keep your hair well-maintained, your makeup flawless, and your clothes clean and tailored to fit you.

"
"
Help people who are struggling socially.,
Do meaningful charitable deeds.,
Appreciate the people in your life.,
Be picky about who you date.",How to Act Like Cher from Clueless3," Much of the plot of Clueless revolves around Cher's efforts to help a girl new to her school adjust and become popular. Have a generous spirit, and when you notice someone struggling socially, help them out. Invite people who don't have very many friends to your parties and introduce them to people, offer to show them around town, and help them find the cool places to hang out.

, Although Cher started off doing good deeds for her own benefit, she eventually learned that doing nice things for people and donating her time to worthy charitable causes was a reward in and of itself. Live your life in a way that tries to give back to causes that need your help. You can donate your time, old items you never use, or money to make a real difference in someone's life.


Blood banks are always looking for more donors; donate blood or platelets if you're of the right age. You could save somebody's life!
Homeless shelters and charities like Salvation Army will take old but in good condition clothing (especially winter goods like jackets, heavy coats, and gloves), furniture, appliances, and even cars.
Many animal shelters and animal adoption agencies can always use people who will come in and feed the animals, walk the dogs, and help give them some human companionship in the time it takes to find them their forever homes.
Consider volunteering to help with a crisis hotline for suicides, runaways, or mental health.

, Cher started off as a person who was very shallow and materialistic, and it nearly hurt her friendship with Dionne and Tai as well as her potential relationship with Josh. After she starts investing time and energy into understanding the people around her and showing them the love and loyalty they deserve, she benefits a great deal. Show appreciation for your friends, family, and significant others by becoming invested in the things they care about and trying to accept the decisions they make.


Your best friend is dating a guy that you don't care for as much. However, there's nothing actually wrong with him as a person, you just don't share the same interests. Be happy for her, show interest in their relationship by asking about how they're doing, and try to be supportive of them as a couple.
Your brother is thinking about moving out of state for college. Although you might be concerned that he won't make new friends or will miss you and your family, help him get enthusiastic about the next stage of his life by looking up different clubs or organizations he can join. Promise that if he wants to call home to talk with you all that you won't tease him.
One of your coworkers is talking about buying a dress that you're not sure is going to look good on her. Offer to go with her to look at a bunch of clothing. Let her try things on in front of you and help her pick an outfit in a cut and color that flatters her body. If she really insists on wearing something you wouldn't be caught dead in, try to say something nice about it anyway, and realize that confidence is the biggest enhancement to beauty a woman can experience.

, Cher cares quite a bit about who she wants to date. Whether it's right or it's wrong, there are a lot of people that she deems unacceptable to be seen with. However, it turns out that the person she thought she wanted to date just because of his looks wasn't a good match for her either. Find and be with someone who, like Josh, is as great on the inside as they are on the outside.


Look for someone who treats others well--maybe they hold the door open for others, or always have a friendly attitude with everyone (even people that are considered ""nerds"" or teachers), and treat waiters and retail employees well.
Look for someone who is generous and kind--maybe they're in a big brother program or they do fundraisers to help homeless kids, but a person with a generous heart is never a bad bet.
Avoid people who are crude, rude, overly angry, or arrogant, especially if they behave badly on a first date. Your date should always be trying to impress you the first couple of times they take you out, so if they're already ill-tempered or unpleasant that's a bad sign.

Get Her Look: To look like Kristen, you must be ready to sacrifice these things: Your hair color, your eye color, your figure, and your complexion.,
Now for Clothing!,
Accessories!,
Kristen's make-up is very simple- some cover up ( if needed ), lip gloss, eyeliner, and mascara,and occasionally eye-shadow but if mom doesn't allow it keep it in your locker(Blues, greens, pinks and lavenders are best) DONE.,
Social Life: Kristen is a part of the most popular clique at school, The Pretty Committee.,
Kristen is identifiable when she uses the PC vocab.Try to use these words in moderation, please.,
HAVE FUN!

",How to Dress Like Kristen in the Clique Books," Even if you do or don't sacrifice these things, you hair must be long, shiny, healthy, blonde (optional) and fab! If your hair isn't long, get real 100% extensions, and have them cut by a stylist, just so you don't get that tacky thinning out as it gets a longer look. You should have swooping layered side bangs, and your hair should be styled to a T everyday. A T means a straight part down the top of your head and have all your hair fanned out on your shoulders. Ponytails, braided piggy tails, and Ponyannas would be your best friend for physical activity, or any sport activate. Your skin must be soft, smooth, yet firm, and clear. You have to be fit, and toned.



Hair: Dark blonde hair(also known as dirty blonde), down to her to her elbows, some say to her waist, either way, Get dirty blonde hair, preferably to your shoulders. Kristen's hair is healthy, strong, and always well conditioned, even if she does lots of sports that makes her sweaty. They also frame her face, is long, and shines under the sun. Her favorite hairstyle is usually a tight, high ponytail because of daily soccer practices, but she also likes to get braids too, or just let them down loose and pin-straight. Make sure (if you already have long hair) that you have no split ends, and that the cut is NOT blunt. Try a ' U ' shape cut so that when your hair is fanned out on your back, it makes a shiny, and healthy looking round shape. It also does a great job of hiding split ends. Typical TPC styles would be straight down, side parted, curled, casual, but perfected updos, and stylish Pollyannas. You don't have to have blonde hair! Just make sure it looks great and feels great!






Brunettes: Your hair is ( usually ) brunette because it complements your skin. Brunettes tend ( not always, but tend ) to have lighter, more fair or olive skin toned than natural blondes ( or at least women who have yellow blonde ) have a slightly darker or tan complexion. If you go blonde, touch up your roots! It doesn't matter if you think it looks ok, it doesn't. If you aren't willing to commit to keeping your hair up, you aren't going be Kristen Gregory any time soon. There is a way you can lighten your hair, with the careful use of professional highlights and low lights, so look into that. Also, there are some products that you put in, and wash out, and you'll get a sunnier hue. Try looking into an auburn dye with blonde low lights, too, its more of a ""red"" shade, but it is a perfect medium of blonde and brunette.






Red Heads: The decision to go blonde is a hard one, and I suggest you DON'T make the decision to. ( Natural ) Red hair is as uncommon as blonde, and there is a chance that your hair would turn an ugly brassy color. So, please, lighten your hair, if you want, or ( again ) go auburn, or just leave it- it's okay to be a red head, your gorgeous!






Raven Haired: Blonde dye is your friend. I have a feeling that a Kristen with black hair and blue eyes is gorgeous. You don't have to have your hair blonde, just a light shade of any color.







Eyes: Kristen had narrow aqua blue eyes, or sometimes green or sapphire blue, if you want go to your eye doctor and get colored contacts. Blue eyes look good on people with fair to olive skin tones. African Americans with complexions of light to med. dark would look good with brown eyes, light brown, or sometimes green (look at Rihanna!). Some cultures (like Kikuyus) that have darker skin tones have naturally light eyes, such as blue or hazel. Your eye color is fine the way it is, but changing it will add to the Kristen persona.






Complexion: You can be fair, light, olive dark, whatever. If you like sun, fake tan, please. looking a little sunkissed and dewy would be preferable. Kristen is pale(i wonder why, 'cause she spends lots of time outdoors) so you should probably dab on whitening serum on your skin. She also has smooth, firm clear skin with a flawless, zit-free T-zone, and she doesn't like junk food.





;
, Kristen, as we all know, is poor, but not poverty stricken. She is more high-middle class. Shops she could at Abercrombie and Fitch, Hollister, Anthropologie, Juicy Couture, Macy's, Forever 21, Aeropostale, American Eagle and Sports Authority( for sports wear). Never, in a million years, get something from Abercrombie with ' A.Fitch' all over it! Kristen maintains her ' rich ' look just as well as the rest of the Pretty Committee, so please, no labels all over your shirt. Some staples you need are... She usually wears sporty-chic clothes like colorful Puma jackets and matching short shorts, but she also has a girly style too, so make sure to buy sports clothes but to also buy girl-like clothes like Juicy patterned tees or Splendid miniskirts. her favorite brand is Juicy and Puma.


Tops: Tanks (preferably solid, in colors that complement your fab sunkissed skin, and hair), scoop necks (long sleeve and short sleeve), off the shoulder tops, tees. There are a LOT of things here.





Skirts: Mini (3, dark denim, light denim, distressed), pencil skirts (2, black and pinstripe?), Tea skirts (pleated/solid/plaid, patterned). Try other styles, like pleated or knee length. Also, try to pull together a sexy school girl look like a plaid pencil skirt a white blouse with a white bra and a matching plaid tie. Shorten the skirt just to keep it long enough to cover everything up but short enough to keep it entertaining.





Outer wear: Bomber Jacket (with fur, or faux fur around the hood), Pea Coat (in Black, White, or Tan. DELIA's makes wonderful pea coats), Swing Trench coat (again, DELIA*s), and maybe fur lined hoodies.







Warm wear: Cardigans, cardigans, cardigans! Sweaters, thermals, designer scarves ( those scarves that bunch up around your neck are tacky! ), and lined hoodies (sometimes acceptable)







Pajamas: Lacy boy shorts and tanks, slips, nightgowns (never longer than knee length, and hopefully a little playful), camis/tanks (tight) fluffy robes. Kristen is a bit sporty, so if you wear pajama bottoms, try to get those sweatpants that are cinched, with words across the butt, or loose bottoms, that are solid or follow the theme of the F.N.S. She also owns lots of Juicy pajamas, like blue-and-white cotton striped pajamas or sheer pink flannel Victoria Secrets pajamas.







Shoes: Heels , Sneakers Never get Champion shoes, unless you NEED them for a sport. Flats are good too, but only on dressy days! Kristen loves sneakers and mostly wear them, but sometimes she also wears flats and kitten heels since she's got style.







, Try to get things like hobos in black, silver and white, and classy jewelry like tangled chain necklaces, a strand of pearls, a tennis bracelet.


Objects Kristen may have
Cell Phone Laptop, or CPU Portable Music Trophies for. If you're not a fabulous athlete like Kristen, that's cool, too.

, She can't afford many brands, so try other stores like Target. They have a great brand called Set, and it is wonderful. Sally's Beauty has a good mineral brand, and it's kind of cheap! Look around! She wears almost no makeup or natural clear makeup, but for her, sunscreen is a MUST for her to not get tanned when shes outdoors playing soccer!

, You don't have to be popular, but it helps if you are. If your going to a new school, or have no friends, try to find a ' TPC' like group to wedge yourself in, or get a group like that together. She is part of the most popular clique in her school, but not like, the top Queen Bee like Massie, so just try to be part of the popular crowd but don't overtake it.



A leader She should be dominant, super confident, highly fashionable with head-to-toe in designer clothing ONLY, and powerful, but not a complete control freak(like Massie is). She should be pretty though, and have ' Massie ' qualities; Shoulder length, shiny dark chestnut brown hair(which grows out long later), glowing amber ( or light ) flickering eyes, rich fair skin, laser whitened smile, and skinny(from yoga and Pilates). Try to go out on a trip with her, and guide her to Massie-esque clothes. She should be good at something ( lots of points if Horseback riding ), and it should be all her own. If you want, get her a Tiffany & Co. gold charm bracelet, and get her charms for it, like a high heeled-shoe, crystal-studded crown, a pug, etc. Also, recommend the Clique books, if she hasn't read them. She also has really witty yet sharp comebacks, so study that.







A Beta Sorry, hun, this isn't you. You are Kristen, the Gamma, or even Delta. This girl should be the watered down version of the Alpha, but be slightly prettier. She should have some ' Alicia ' qualities- Tan, perhaps ethnic(half Spanish), huge boobs(C cups), skinny, slightly toned(from her dancing), perfectly straight white teeth, red full lips, thick, super glossy, long raven hair ( black or dark brown ), rich, and the queen of gossip. It would help if she liked the spotlight, or likes to share gossip. Get her into blogging about your daily school news, or secrets ( kind of like Gossip Girl ).Make sure, or guide her to one brand she loves, so she'll stay loyal to it, and trademark it as her own. Her favorite brand is Ralph Lauren and she likes classy, high-brand, preppy, clothes that are crisp and tailored. She also is obsessed with dancing and is really good at it, so teach her dancing too.







A Delta This could be you, it's the Kristen position of the clique.







A Gamma: She is the ' Dylan'. She should have some of her qualities, like- Normal or Average body, long, ultra-thick soft fiery-red curls, sharp emerald green cat's eyes, funny, isn't afraid to be herself, truthful, and catty. It would help if she knew some one famous, or is aspiring to be some sort of socialite. Dylan's style is hard to define, so guide her wherever. She wears lots of black to make her look skinny(though she's actually average-weight) but loves to wear exotic colorful boho fashion too. Her mom is a celebrity host from the very famous morning talk show The Daily Grind, so make sure she has a famous celeb mom too.

Also try to get hair products that are focusing on fixing a certain thing, like getting rid of dandruff or making your hair softer. Paint your nails once a week with 2 coats of clear polish over it and grow out your nails so they are long and pretty. Moisturizer every time you get out of the shower to prevent scaly, dry skin. Also wash your face with Clean & Clear products and moisturize your face with non-irritating lotion to help hydrate your face but not make you break out. Coconut oil is perfect for moisturizing and making your face like bright and awake. Also buy Fitness Buddy and a yoga app that can help you get more fit and beautiful.;
, Massie rarely pigs out on sweets, so try to eat healthy. Fruit gives you a trim figure and glowing skin at the same time. Do a sport like tennis, yoga or pilates.

, Wear brands. If you can't afford these brands, it doesn't matter. Just make sure that what you're wearing looks expensive and hot. Some ideas are Zara, Forever XXI, or Nordstroms Rack.

, Massie Block has amazing hair. To achieve this, you will need to use a good quality shampoo & conditioner. Massie uses Bumble & Bumble. Redken is great, too. If you can't afford expensive shampoos, try Herbal Essences. They have different shampoos for different hair types, and it smells great. Massie Block has chestnut hair and caramel highlights. Try a temporary chestnut dye at home and see if it suits you. You don't have to have the exact same hair color, though. Just make sure it's shiny and smells delicious.

, Massie's perfume is Chanel No.19. Juicy Couture & Britney Spears do some nice perfumes. Victoria's Secret has ah-mazing ones at ah-mazing prices. If you're bold, go for a line from Secret Garden, or one of their perfumes like Bombshell, Noir, Sexy Rocks, Dream Angels, etc. If you're softer, try their natural line or pink. They're inexpensive and a 10. Just make sure you're totally committed to it and people can smell you when you're coming. Massie's signature piece of jewelry is a charm bracelet. Try to get one from Tiffany & Co. If you can't afford their jewelry, try Juicy Couture or Pandora.

, Maybe it's perfume, or a necklace, or anything. Wear it all the time, never go out in public without it. Massie always wears her charm bracelet, so it would be great if you always wore your special item too.

, Try brand names. Your handbag is like your bedroom, only smaller. Always carry your cell phone lip gloss with you. An alpha never ignores a text.

, Massie's is white with touches of purple You can choose your own signature color and decorate your room accordingly.

, Don't make it too flashy like sequins or excessive amounts of animal prints and patterns. Also don't be overly organized but messy. Massie doesn't have to worry about keeping her room clean because she has Inez, but I'm pretty sure mostly everyone doesn't have their own maid, so be sure to clean your room constantly and make it pretty.

, Remember, even the LBRs don't deserve to be teased. If you aren't nice, nobody will like you.

, Please keep it private! If it is public, jealous people can use it to scheme against you. .

, Blog weekly about your life. Do not give the website address to everyone at school. Soon they'll all start reading it, and call you a poser. However, if it is a fashion blog/ something glamorous that people will feel the need to read, go for it. If you partied it up in Beverly Hills, give the details, but leave some to the imagination, and don't post secrets or things you wouldn't want others to know if it were you. Exposing people is so wrong. If you don't want a real life blog, try a roleplaying blog. Roleplaying is when you write a blog about a fictional character.

, Massie is extremely popular at school. This may take a while. Try changing schools if possible. This is an easier solution because you can start over. Hold a lot of parties, and always make sure your birthday parties are grand and exclusive. Only invite popular people, no LBR's allowed.


Now that you're a popular alpha, don't get carried away. For example, don't majorly break someone down into tears if they bump into you, instead just give them a glare, a comeback, flip your hair in their face and walk away before they can say anything. Also, be nice to teachers and your parents and get good grades. Even though popularity may seem like everything at this time of life, you will regret not caring about school when trying to apply for college. Finally, if someone was mean to you or excluded you, get revenge, but do it subtly because if you do something major and get caught you could be in big trouble e.g. i you say, someone accidentally spills something on you don't fill their bag with goo cause if you get caught you'll be in big trouble







, Massie Block's clique is called The Pretty Committee. Unless absolutely no one at your school reads The Clique, (highly unlikely) then choose a different name. Suggestions include the Glossy Posse, Glam Clan, Glamourous etc. Make sure your clique has no more than 6 girls. An alpha isn't necessary, but if there is one, make sure it's you... Also, to get invited to parties, try playing hard to get. For example, if your friend Sara is having a party but ""forgot"" to invite you, just say ""Oh, whatever."" My other choice would be getting mani-pedis with (clique name), and that's more fun than your party will be. Later."" The person will get jealous and invite you to their party. Also have a weekly sleepover with your clique, read fashion magazines and keep caught up on the latest fashion trends.


Gather up a group of friends and slowly create a clique. Don't tell them ""I want to make a clique with you all and I will be the alpha,"" because 'clique' sounds tacky, and telling them that you will be the leader might make them feel offended by how bossy you are. Instead, make some new friends (preferably popular girls) and plan all the get togethers and everything, then soon sit at you own table and make sure you are in the middle. If you want to use your current group of friends be sure to overthrow the current leader by not inviting her to as many things and sitting in her spot (make sure everyone else in your group doesn't want her to be the leader as much as you do too).







, Make sure there's always at least one set of eyes on you. Flirt a little bit, but only with people you like, because then people will call you a flirt.

, If your clique members are already popular and have a good sense of style, there's no need to change their wardrobe. But if your friends shop at Justice or Gap, go shopping ASAP. Go to places like Aeropostale, Hollister, American Eagle, Sephora and Victoria's Secret PINK. When shopping, be the one to tell them what they would look adorable in. Give them little beauty tips too, like ""This is perfect, green is so you,"" and ""Don't buy that, yellow doesn't compliment your skin tone,"". Try to buy a ton of stuff and encourage them to start shopping there if they don't shop at the popular stores.

, Try to get your friends to take turns, like have one girl have this weeks sleepover, then another next week's, and so on. This way you aren't stressing out every Friday making sure everything is perfect. When it is your turn to host one, make sure it's perfect. Have the sleepover somewhere where your parents can't hear you, like the basement (only if its finished). If you have soft little mattresses to sleep on, make sure there is enough so everyone has their fair share of comfort. Arrange the mattresses in a flower and put snacks in the middle with cups of water and fancy curly straws in front of each mattress. When you watch movies arrange the mattresses in a half circle so everyone can see the movie without having to turn around to watch it. Make sure there is plenty to do and there are all the supplies to make crafts or anything is in the same room as you. Also, even though its fun to pull all-nighters, try to get to bed by midnight so your friends aren't too tired the next day.

Let's start with the look- you've got to look amazing, 'cause as Skye puts it, ""um, we're not exactly ugly""- so take great care of yourself, and soon you'll have a bf who wants to do the same...,
Now for the style.,
For the attitude, be super sweet, but tricky when needed.,
Flirt all the time, and kiss nearly as much, but don't get a fixed boyfriend unless absolutely necessary (do not give up true love just to be like some character in a book, obviously.",How to Be Like the DSL Daters from the Clique Series,"


If your hair is not already blonde, I seriously suggest that you dye or highlight it to the desired blondness.Or an even cheaper ""in the shower"" blonding idea for girls with dark brown hair is John Freida blonding glaze. It gradually makes brown hair look NATURALLY lighter even though its made for blondes. Once you've done that, wash and condition it every single day with either Bumble and Bumble or Aveda products. Wear it in dancey styles, like buns, ponytails, etc, but also occasionally just keep it down and wavy.
Make sure your skin is the best it can be- this means getting acne treatments prescribed and using them religiously. One or two blackheads is all right, but you just are not going to win a beauty pageant with a pimple the size of a tomato.
Wear a little make-up, from upscale brands such as Clinique (and Skye wears their Happy Perfume, so you might want to go for that, too), Sephora, Estee Lauder, and Victoria's Secret. However, if you want to get less obvious make-up from drugstore brands(you really only need expensive lip gloss and perfume- that's all other people need to see, right?) then go ahead.
Shower everyday, maybe twice a day, and use a cute smelling bath gel such as Essence of Beauty. Always wear deodorant! You never want a visible sweat mark!;
, Wear dancey clothes such as leggings, flats, shrugs, legwarmers, etc. with your basics (basics can come from stores like Old Navy or Forever21) and throw in a few expensive designer items (designer bag mandatory), such as Coach bags, Louis Vuitton sunglasses, Calvin Klein jeans, Tommy Hilfiger flip flops, etc. We are basically going for the rich ballerina look.

, Don't gossip too much, but a little is healthy fun, so go for it! Make sure your clique is at least semi-popular.

, That's pathetic.). Every time you kiss a boy, buy a new, thin silver bangle.

"
"
Get a white t-shirt.,
Wear a pair of white or silver-grey shorts/skinny jeans.

,
Wear a pair of yellow/golden socks.

,
The boots will require some modification.,
Take some plain white gloves.,
Wear some golden wrist bands over the gloves.

",How to Dress Like a Humanized Silver the Hedgehog," Wear a silver-grey vest or button-up t-shirt (leave it un-buttoned) over it.;
,,, Using clothing paint, create a white vertical stripe down the middle front leading to the toes. Paint aqua-blue over the toe of the boots.

, Again, they will have to be modified. With the same aqua-blue clothing paint, create a circle in the palm of the glove. Paint a short line underneath it connecting to the wrist.

Massie dresses very maturely, as well as cute and chic.,
The best places to shop are Macy's (if you can afford it), Charlotte Russe, H&M, Abercrombie and Fitch, Nordstroms, Wet Seal, and other stores or websites that have gorgeous and hot couture style clothes for less.,
It's essential to buy stuff that you know will go with other things, so you don't buy a red and white blazer and nothing to go with it.,
Remember that Massie almost never wears pants.",How to Dress Like Massie Block Inexpensively," Her style consists of layering amazing pieces such as blazers, ruffle tops, mini skirts, dresses, leggings, and all kinds of shoes. She wears all labels, but that doesn't mean she's hard to emulate if you have not much money to spend. Generally, she has a cross between a preppy style and a rich girl style (throughout the books this is called ""unique"");
, Pick out pieces that you like and Massie would wear, not just anything you see that looks like she would adore, if you don't like it.

, Massie would probably wear something like a slouchy gray dress with a turquoise cami underneath and a tangle of silver necklaces and turquoise flats. Also, she might wear dark wash denim skinny jeans, slouchy dark brown boots, a denim blazer, and a solid colored v-neck if she was feeling very casual.

, She usually wears a cute skirt or mini dress, even in winter. If you do wear pants, wear skinny or flared jeans. Cashmere is expensive but worth it if pursuing her look. Massie also never wears sweats, unless it's the weekend or time for bed. On the weekend she usually settles with designer sweatsuits, but you don't have to.

Tidy your face.,
Hair.,
If you want a more bigger eye look and really hot eyes then buy the NEO Seashell Circle Lenses if you search up NEO or GEO lenses in images then you'll see what they look like, popular in places such as Korea, Japan, Taiwan and HK.

Try to not wearing make-up for a week you'll see a big difference to your new clean face.
Do get a facial once or twice every week you'll feel and look more sexy.;
, Leah usually always has either brown or dark brown hair i think you should dye your hair colour a tone or two darker then your skin colour because having it to light can make your hair look unhealthy. Get a fringe make sure its one that goes to the side it doesn't have to be a side-fringe just make sure it DOESN'T hang in/over your eye's, you've heard MANY on times guys saying the main thing that stands out on a girl her amazingly beautiful eyes!

,, try for a more plump look wear some kissable lip gloss so your lips will stand out.

, Apply black liquid eyeliner on the upper rim thingy of your eye's make sure to not overdo it keep it thin then apply thin amount of eyeliner on the bottom rim. use an eyeshadow two shades lighter then your skin colour and apply it on your eyelids then all UNDER the area of the eyebrow to the eyelid. use one dab of grey eyeshadow and brush it over the black eyeliner on the upper rim so the liquid doesn't look so straight and even. just make sure the grey eyeshadow is even. apply black mascara on the top and bottom of your eyelashes. (don't use more than two coats)

, Use a natural pink shimmer blush and apply it on the cheekbones.

, loose some weight and tone up.

, look at the fashion brands that Leah Dizon wears, you don't have to empty your whole wardrobe and go shopping just get some similar or basic things to wear that look like something that Leah's style of clothing.

How to get her hair: In the book, it is described that Claire Lyons has long, straight, blond hair with bangs.,
How to get her makeup: Claire doesn't wear as much make up as Massie or any of the PC.,
Clothes: Claire doesn't have as much money to be spending on designer clothes all the time, but manages to look cool and cute in a very casual, loose way.,
Technology: Claire has Alicia's dad's mobile but you don't have to borrow someone else's phone.,
Attitude: Claire has a sweet personality, so different from Massie's.",How to Be Like Claire Lyons from the Clique," You can dye it but it is NOT recommended if you have raven hair. You can buy a wig if you want but if you don't want to, that is absolutely fine. Get bangs - you can go to the hairdressers to do this or if you think you are a hairstyling expert, you can do it by yourself but I don't suggest this. Claire tries to grow out her bangs, though, so having them is not an absolute must. Claire is mostly herself though, so to really be like her, keeping your hair the way it is is completely fine. It doesn't have to be extremely well, and professional looking, Claire doesn't care. If you brush your hair, wash your hair, condition it, and rinse it with cold water to make it as shiny as possible, your hair will be nice enough.;
, She just uses simple scented/flavored lip gloss in a fruity flavor. She has blue eyes that are beautiful and very noticeable, but no matter what color your eyes are, getting them noticed is really a matter of technique. Silver eyeshadow brings out your eyes the best, but try finding a color that truly brings out the color and shape of your eyes, as everyone is different. Claire is lucky to not have gotten bitten by the acne bug, but not everyone is as fortunate. To be like her, you can't wear any foundation, so having clear skin is a must. Clean and Clear has many great products to help you get the flawless dreamy sin you want. Use it every day, day and night with a moisturizer and in the mornings, a teeny bit of powder is a miracle worker and you'll be perfectly fresh-faced. A tiny bit of rosy blush and clear mascara will take you where you want to go. You'll be looking oh-so-natural with these tips and tricks!

, As basics, get 10 pairs of jeans. Claire likes skinnies, so maybe invest in those. Get flare jeans, bootcut, cropped jeans and capris too. Buy 5 pairs of colorful, cute shorts (Remember: Claire is from Orlando) Claire also has many graphic t-shirts with cartoon characters and funny sayings. You could find these at Walmart, Kohl's, Kmart, etc. For shirts with funny sayings, check out Snorg tees because they are hilarious. Claire's signature shoes are Keds, so try investing in some of those puppies. If they aren't your style, Converse and Vans work too and may be even better. Get accessories like necklaces, bracelets (friendship bracelets, not real jewelry, cute very small and non-dangling earrings, hats, small totes and belts, good ones can be found at Forever 21. Shop at vintage places too, they have cute and cheap things to help personalize, and make your style very unique. Claire has sweatshirts, sweatpants, and all that fun, comfy stuff so remember to have quite a few, and wear at least two each week to keep up that casual, sweet look.

, Just think what kind of phone Claire would get if her mom allows her. Cheap, but useful phones are good. Really, you don't have to get an I Phone or anything close to it. An MP3 or Walkman would be nice and you can get it in your favourite color.

, You shouldn't be forced to be someone you aren't. If you want to be popular, that's okay but remember to be yourself during the process. Try to be friends with a member of a very popular clique at school. If they reject you, don't be a totally mean bully unless you want to make enemies. Now, you don't want that don't you?

The night you get home from school before break, talk to your friends online about your ah-mazing plans.,
Make sure you look absolutely perfect at all times.,
Buy presents for your family that are ah-dorable but not necessarily expensive.,
Get a mani-pedi before you actually do anything.,
Act like Massie at parties.,
If you're hosting or going to a family party, do the following:


Roll your eyes at your parents when they do something annoying.,
Halfway through the holidays and the end of the break, do something with your friends.,
Halfway through the time you got off from school and the holidays, do something with your friends.,
Make sure you know what's going on in your town.",How to Act Like Massie Block During the Holidays," You can bend the truth a little bit, but don't make it completely unbelievable. Are you going to your mom's office party? If so, tell them you'll be going to do some major partying.;
, Catch up on all the trends for winter and wear whatever you can that's trendy.

, Some bath and body works shower gel for your mom. Some Victoria's secret lipgloss or an iTunes gift card for your college-bound sis. Some Habbo Hotel credits for your brother. Just put a nice, heartfelt and sincere note attached to them and slip them in their stockings or give them to them after you light the menorah or whenever.

, Stuck catching reruns of holiday specials on Nickelodeon? Go to the spa. Get a massage and a mani-pedi. Or do it yourself. Both are acceptable.

, Going to your mom's office party? Tip time:


Make a big entrance. The flashier, the better.
Act bored. Constantly.
When people tell you how big you've grown or whatever, accept their compliments with a smile and a thank you and leave it at that. Only return the compliment if it's your mother's boss or whatever.
Don't even look at kids who aren't cool. Chances are, if you are reading this article, you won't have many kids your age at the office. Scout for kids your age and ask your mom on the car ride over. If they are actually cool and not playing with a Nintendo, you can talk to them.

,
Hang around with your COOL. COOL. Cousins. Leave your dorky younger cousins behind. If you have no cousins, try to smooch some gossip from your mom and aunts.
Act disgusted when you see the table is filled with food you don't like and don't eat too much. Chew gum at the party or have a lighter meal before you go.
Text your friends a lot and act like you don't care.
You're going to get crappy gifts from some relatives, you'll just have to grin and bear it. Even if the sweater your aunt brought for you smells like goats, just smile and say thank you. Don't forget to write ah-mazing thank you notes for every gift!

, Ideally, meet up at Starbucks at the mall to chat about your holidays, gossip, and then go shopping for everything you didn't get during the holidays that you wanted.

, Before Christmas/Hannukah/other holiday, go shopping with your friends for Christmas presents, bake cookies, go to the spa, whatever.

, Did Ben get kicked out of school? Did Bryce and Amanda hook up? Make sure you know this.

Stand out.,
Wear unique accessories.,
Party and club lots.,
Go wild with your hair and take it for that special ride!,
Make your skin look beautiful.,
Get some clothing that give the 'wow' effect.,
Explore what life is like for Lady gaga.,
Be on Facebook or Twitter if you parents allow you.,
Come with a short but awesome nickname.,
Add bold make-up.",How to Take Over the World (Lady Gaga Style)," Lady Gaga shows people what she’s made of by standing out in wild clothing and makeup. Anything that includes glitter, sequins and bows are Gaga enough!;
, People who take over the world Gaga style do not care what people think about how they dress. Lady Gaga wears accessories that are not common. Try wearing that babyish headband that you haven't worn since you were four. If you can, wear old fashion accessories that nobody wears anymore and bring them back to life and back in style.

, Lady gaga’s life is also involved in partying and clubbing. Search for the clubs that are well known. Ask a group of friends to come along with you. See warnings for this step.

, Lady gaga recently keeps her hair a light honey blonde, but you are concerned about dying your hair you could buy a wig or keep your hair the way it is and just make it look awesomely crazy. Lady Gaga makes a bow in her hair, but if you are not sure how to make a bow in your hair, Buy a wig with a Lady Gaga bow in it.

, Lady Gaga shows her skin too much a lot of the time, but showing too much skin is inappropriate. So instead, make the skin that you already have beautiful so that you can get a similar 'wow' effect. Exfoliate often and take care of your skin well.

, This doesn't mean show as much skin as Lady Gaga, this just means get clothing that looks jaw-dropping amazing on you. Try wearing some red leather every so often for a 'bad girl' effect, or even wear an outfit that you designed and made yourself! Also wear loads of sparkles/glitter!

, Why not try singing one of her songs or even doing some research on her and her life?

, You become more well-known if you join social network sites. Also, send Lady Gaga a friend request.

, It could be anything from ‘savvy geek’ to ‘electro kitty.’ People often remember somebody just for a short, great nickname.

, Apply a thick layer of black or navy blue eyeliner around your eyes, and then on the eyelid add a shiny purple or silver eye shadow so that you look a bit like a robot (Lady Gaga often has this robotic look). Apply a rich gold or a red lipstick.

Get some sleep.,
Have good hygiene.,
Lay out clothes.,
If you can, do not buy a book bag, Massie would never have one.,
Always have makeup on at school!,
Make sure your hair looks great!,
Do not be mean!",How to Be Like Massie Block on the First Day of School," Try going to bed early for a few nights before school starts so you have your energy and can get up in the morning. Try getting up early too for a few mornings. Start doing this about 3-4 days before school starts.;
, Would you hang out with someone who smells bad? Take showers, brush your teeth, wear deodorant, etc.

, Before you go to bed, pick out an outfit for school tomorrow to save time.


Look at magazines and websites like Polyvore for outfit ideas and inspiration.
It's also a good idea to decide how you'll do your hair and pack your lunch, etc.

, Instead get cute bags like from Von Maur, Eddie Bauer, Coach, or if you don't have the money for that get a big Aeropostale bag.


Fill your bag with your must have supplies. Textbooks, blotting sheets, lip gloss, tissues, pens, tampons/pads, & snacks (Luna bars are great!) are some good things to start off with.

, It makes your face look clean and gives it a glow. But don't overdo it, or else you will look like a clown. Massie always wears makeup! But make sure you wash your face 2 times a day (morning and night) because makeup can cause acne!


Be sure to buy the correct makeup for your skin type. If your skin is oily, you don't need ""hydrating"" makeup!
Not allowed to wear makeup? Use tinted lip balm and Vaseline on your eyelashes. The Vaseline helps condition your lashes (to help them grow longer) and acts as a clear mascara.

, Look on Youtube for tutorials & scour magazines for inspiration. You can try braids, buns, curls, etc.


Flat ironing your hair? Do it the night before so in the morning, you'll just have to do a quick touch-up.
Use a thermal spray to prevent excess heat damage.
Organic Virgin Coconut oil makes a great deep conditioner for curly, dry, or damaged hair.

, It just gets you off to a bad start and you will lose friends. Even though Massie is mean doesn't mean you should do it. You could get in lots of trouble! So when you walk down the hall say ""Hi!"" to your friends and even you enemy's because they could start liking you. When you see a friend looking sad go up to him or her and ask what's wrong. Just be as nice as you can. If you do that, you have a good chance of having lots of friends, like Massie.

Make sure your hair is an off-red orangey piss color to complement your freckles, rosy cheeks and complexion.,
Wear a ""farmer"" red button-up plaid shirt, long sleeved of course.,
Find cutoff jeans.,
Wear shoes only when walking around in public areas; otherwise, just go for tube socks, especially when drumming at a show.

,
Accessorize.,
Have either a goofy smile on your face or an emotionless gaze to seemingly nowhere.",How to Look Like Tristan Tarr (Theset)," Make sure you have a random swirl at the top of the 'do, looking to the also popular eighties band Flock of Seagulls for reference. Hair must be cut around shoulder length and preferably straightened. To add on to the look, make your hair greasy and finger-lickin' good.;
, Or, if this type of shirt is unavailable to you just wear a simple red tee. Again, the red is to compliment the freckles and complexion. On those cold breezy days, a slightly ""shrunken-in-the-wash"" hoody will keep you nice and toasty.

, To create his already established look, you must wear cutoffs! Preferably, cut your jeans just above the knee with bits and pieces of jean frays at the hemline. Legs must always be covered in sweat from excessive drum playing.

,, One piercing will suffice on the left hand side of your lips. If desired, a simple red bandanna (also to compliment your rosy cheeks and complexion) may be tied around your neck or around your forehead. A water bottle for constant hydration (view: Personality, Diet) may also add to the ""physique.""

, When drumming, your emotions must all be put towards flipping your head side to side to create a great photo-op for photographers - people really enjoy red hair flopping around everywhere. Music, in some ways, influences his personality. When working with fellow co-workers you must always enjoy singing along to whatever song is playing and enjoying yourself. When at shows, your personality is very much like at the work environment - you enjoy singing along to what ever is playing. When refreshments are available, you will develop the habit of grabbing two water bottles, holding one in each hand, and air-drumming with them to the beat. Sometimes to make the effect even greater, you thrust along with the beat as well."

Smile often.,
Get the personality.,
Let the haters hate.",How to Look Like Taylor Swift," Taylor wears a fair amount of make-up, but she never overdoes it. She keeps it simple and natural, and everyone knows that Taylor has the most beautiful eyes. Other than her cat eyes and red lipstick, the rest of her look is au naturel. She prefers nude, and light pink colors around her eyes and skin, so there’s no need for overly-dramatic makeup.


That said, there’s always a bit of a difference between day makeup and night makeup. Your daytime Taylor look can be a bit more subtle, and your night Taylor look can include darker, more dramatic shadows, a bit more blush, and more vibrant lipstick.;
, Taylor’s trick is thick eyelashes, pretty shadows, and smart eyeliners. For shadows, go with sweet colors, like pastel pinks and purples, or go with bright colors; another look Taylor very often wears is a plum, brown, or black smokey eye. Use a brush to gently blend the shadow into your eyelids, using the darker colors on the outside and inner corner of the lids.

, Taylor typically wears black mascara, which goes great with her fair skin and makes her eyes pop. If you still don't have that full thick look that Taylor has, put on some fake eyelashes, then apply mascara. Just be careful with fake eyelashes — you don’t want them to look so fake that they’re distracting.


You can experiment and use dark brown or even plum-colored mascara as well.

, This doesn’t mean that you should wear loads of makeup, but that you should take care of your face. You should wash your face at least twice a day to prevent breakouts or even try acne cream or a cleanser if you need it. Though her skin is pretty light, you can aim to get a bit of a tan so you don’t look too pale. Having tanner skin can help it look more smooth, too. You don’t need to get a spray-on tan; just spend a bit more time in the sunshine!


Try applying some skin cream on every day to get the ultra-smooth skin. It's also nice to spritz on some nice-smelling perfume or lotion, but remember not to put on too much!

, Just use a little bit of mascara and some eyeliner (black is the better color). If you like eyeshadow, put on a little bit of a peachy color. This has always been Taylor's known eye makeup method.

, Do some wingtip black eyeliner and set it with a dark shadow, making an oval shape on the outer corner. Use a black liquid liner, or a thin brush and some cream liner, and try to make the line thin, at first, so you don’t overdo it and create a look that is too dramatic. The cat eyes are the most signature part of Taylor’s look, so it can be important to practice to get it down.


Just know that it can be a little challenging to get that “cat eyes” look on your first try — it’ll take a bit of practice, so try it at home a few times when you don’t have anywhere to go before you debut this new look.

, Taylor Swift is famous for her bright red lipstick and can be seen wearing it on the red carpet, or on casual hangouts with friends. Though bright red lipstick isn’t flattering for everyone — it can look best on very light or darker skin, but a bit off on tanner skin — you can still try it to see if it suits you. Taylor has nice, full lips, so you can line your lips a bit to get that pouty bottom lip that contributes to her beauty.


If red lipstick is too much for you, then you can try a lighter color, like a subtle pink, or even run a clear gloss over your lips. Taylor has been seen wearing very light lipstick, too.

, Taylor doesn’t wear dramatic blush, but she does put a little bit of color on the apples of her cheeks. After you apply foundation, take a blush brush to the hollows of your cheeks and make sure to gently blend in the blush so it looks natural. Use just a little bit of blush at first and add a bit more if you think it would improve your look.


You can skip out on the blush during the day and use it for more formal, nighttime events, too.
If you have fair skin like Taylor, then blush can really help add some rose to your look.

, If you want to look like Taylor, you definitely don’t have to change the color of your locks. However, her hair has been pretty consistently light blonde since the beginning of her career, so you can give it a try if you’ve been getting bored with your brown or red locks. You can give it a go and dye your hair blonde, or just get some blond highlights in your darker tresses if you’re really committed to owning the Taylor look.


If you have any other hair color than blonde it might not matter. Since you are yourself, we don't want your look to be too exact unless it's Halloween. So all you should do is curl it with big, buoyant locks.






That said, you can totally pick and choose which aspects of Taylor’s looks you’d like to emulate. If dying your hair isn’t for you, skip it. Taylor would tell you to be yourself and to do what feels right.

, Though Taylor’s hair has most recently been feathery and straight, if you want a more classic Taylor look, then you can use a curling iron or even rollers to get the extra-curly Taylor look. Her hair has varied in degrees of curliness, and you can try for the extra-curled ringlets first and then see if you’d like a looser, more flowing look. Here’s how you can try to get those curls:


A good way to get Taylor Swift hair: after washing your hair, separate it into parts and put it up in large rollers. Let your hair dry, and once it is, take out the rollers, and you'll see what a great result you will get. If you do not want super defined curls, then just wash your hair and add a bit of mousse. Then place your head down and flip your hair over and dry your hair slowly while scrunching it.
If your hair is really straight, then you will have to use mousse and a curling iron. Be careful not to burn your hair by making sure that your hair is 100% dry before beginning to curl. After, use a bit of hairspray to keep the look and hold the curl.

, If you want to rock the curls, then let those ringlets flow! Taylor sometimes wears hair extensions to get that extra long, curly look, and you can try doing that, or just growing your hair out past your shoulders. Just a bit of mousse and spray to hold those curls in place, and you should be fine with letting those curls flow down over your face, nice and loose.She doesn't wear her hair half up too often or use a lot of hair accessories or bobby pins normally; so, like Taylor, just show off your pretty curls the natural way.

, Sometimes Taylor puts her hair up instead of letting it flow down. She often straightens it to do this. She has sometimes put it up in a higher ponytail and rocked the straight bangs, letting a wisp of hair fall on either side of her face. This can give you a break from maintaining those beautiful curls and can add a new dimension to your Taylor-inspired look.


You don’t have to straighten it to wear it up, either. You can rock an updo with Taylor’s curls as well.

, Though Taylor is associated with her curly hair, a lot of time has passed since she sang “Teardrops on My Guitar.” While she still loves the curly-haired look, she also likes to mix it up now and again and goes for the super straight hair. You can have straight hair with or without bangs, wear it straight down, hide it under a beanie or a top hat, place it in a side-braid, or even let it fall to the left side of your face. Taylor has done all of these things and has looked fabulous every time.


She has occasionally worn her straight hair half up, half down, but she mostly goes for one or the other.

, Taylor has also worn bangs, adding a cute new dimension to her straight-haired look. If you want to try the straight hair version of Taylor, then consider getting some bangs to match. You can get regular bangs that fall just above your eyebrows, shorter, thinner bangs that are even less prominent, falling an inch above your brows, or dramatic, fuller bangs that fall just above your eyes — Taylor has rocked all three.


You can show those bangs off by wearing your hair down straight or putting it in a braid or ponytail.
When you grow them out, you can also let them fall around one side of your face, just like Taylor does it.

, Taylor has said herself that she absolutely loves dresses, and you can almost always see her wearing one. Some memorable ones include her blue dress in the video for ""Our Song"", and the long, bluish-green, off-the-shoulder dress she wears in the video for ""Teardrops on My Guitar"", and yet another stunning dress in ""Mean"". Though Taylor has an edge to her, she’s definitely not apologetic about being a girly girl.


Taylor even has her own sundress line for L.E.I. at Walmart; this is a good place to buy Taylor-inspired dresses for reasonable prices.
When you need a more formal look, try a semi-formal dress accented with a bold accessory such as a wide belt or large handbag.
She wears a lot of dresses that are peach colored or white. When she’s not wearing solid-colored dresses, she can be seen in more casual polka dot or striped dresses, too.

, Taylor wears jeans a lot, too. Light wash boot cut jeans and dark wash straight legs are what she wears. Again, you can buy the from L.E.I. or you can go to JC Penny for a less expensive pair of jeans than the top designers. Most clothing stores at the mall are most likely going to be less expensive than outlet centers.


With the jeans, she wears light tees. Like the color white, but sometimes black and brown. She wears tanks, baby doll tees, and tanks with jackets.
On chilly days, she wears long trench coats with leggings and boots.

, When Taylor’s not on the red carpet, she also wears pull-overs, preppy sweaters, long sleeved shirts in solid colors, or just cute thin sweaters with large polka dots, pandas, stars, or hearts all over them. She likes to go for a more playful look when she’s not at an awards show.

, Taylor has been seen sporting black thick-framed glasses as well as red thick-framed glasses. You can go for a more casual look and try wearing a pair of these glasses, along with putting your hair in a braid.

, Taylor has been seen with dark blue shiny nails. Try ""midnight cami"" by Essie. She also wears clear nails, pink nails, or nails with more subtle colors as well. She has often been seen with bright red nails, which match the color of her lipstick.

, Taylor always draws a 13 on her hand. Outline a 13 with a black marker, go and color it in with a turquoise/light blue marker and paint over it with clear glittery nail polish. She draws this number on the outside of her right hand because she believes the number 13 brings her good luck; she was born on the 13th of December, her first album went gold in 13 weeks, and her first #1 song had a 13-second intro. Every time she has won an award she's been seated in either the 13th seat, the 13th row, the 13th section or row M, which is the 13th letter. , Taylor usually wears cowgirl boots, flats and high heels. Her current favorites are Keds in every style and pattern, and Oxfords are another love of Tay's. Keds and Oxfords are affordable, and you can find cowgirl boots at a reasonable price at Target or on sale at BP, so Taylor’s look won’t be out of your price range. The important is that you wear the shoes with confidence, not that you wear the most expensive boots out there.


Though Taylor can be a bit of tomboy, she likes to dress up, too. She has been seen in shiny black flats, high heels with a thicker heels, and peek-a-boo heels, too. She likes heels that are silver, brown, or black.

, Think ""country girl"", but this doesn't mean you have to wear plaid shirts or t-shirts and jeans every day. Taylor Swift has a balance of tomboy and girly, and her style is very romantic. A cute skirt and shirt or sundresses make a great start — and don't forget the boots! Taylor loves wearing sundresses, and you can or should try putting an old denim jacket over that.


The important thing is that you don’t let society tell you to stop looking so “country” if you want to look mainstream. And remember that “country” isn’t just a way to dress — it’s a way of life.

, Taylor is known for her friendliness and her super sweet smile. Make sure that your teeth are in good shape. Buy mouthwash, floss, toothpaste and if your teeth are still not healthy, whitening toothpaste. Remember to combine whitening toothpaste with regular toothpaste when you use it because whitening toothpaste does not prevent cavities.


Remember that Taylor is never too cool to smile at anybody, and you shouldn’t be, either.

, Taylor is a smart, funny, friendly, and generally nice to have around. Try to be modest and have a sunny attitude. Don't be sarcastic if you can help it, and be friendly to everyone! Taylor is seen as modest, down-to-earth, and never lets fame get to her head. She keeps her close friends around and doesn’t hang out with posers.


She doesn't make rash choices and doesn't particularly care to follow what other people are doing if it's a negative influence (i.e. Drugs, alcohol, that sort of thing.) She is an honest and trustworthy person, and likes to laugh!

, Taylor doesn’t care when people are mean to her or gossip about her dating life or clothes. She understands that she has millions of Twitter followers and doesn’t hate on the haters. Instead, Taylor appreciates all of the good things in her life and treats everyone with kindness and grace. Don’t let anyone get you down or tell you who you are. Work on being like Taylor, and having the confidence that lets you do your own thing without caring about what other people are saying about you.

Have a charitable attitude.",How to Look Like Shakira," Shakira always seems to have flawless skin, and she's shared beauty tips that have helped her keep her skin hydrated and clean. Before bed, remove any makeup on your skin so that your pores do not get clogged overnight. Then, apply a vitamin C serum daily before applying your makeup, and Vitamin E when your skin gets especially dry. Shakira also stresses the importance of wearing sunscreen to keep your skin healthy.Shakira gets her vitamin E from capsules she buys at the pharmacy and squeezes them onto her skin.
Shakira is a proponent of natural products, and tries to buy beauty products that have as few chemicals in them as possible. Her favorite sunscreen is BabyGanic Sunscreen Spray.;
, Differing from many stars, Shakira actually claims to do most of her own makeup herself. To get the same look that Shakira has, focus on keeping it simple. Start by applying a foundation and then move onto makeup that accentuates your features without going overboard.Shakira prefers Tarte foundation because it is oil-free and waterproof, and then uses Origins Pinch Your Cheeks to add a soft pink glow to her cheeks.

, After Shakira has applied a layer of foundation to cover up any blemishes, she applies blush to her cheeks, but not too much. Consider using a cream blush and brush it along the apple of your cheeks. Use a shade that is only slightly pinker than your skin tone. You want your blush to look natural, as if you weren't wearing any and your cheeks just have a rosy glow.


If you aren't sure what color of blush to wear, pinch your cheeks. Then, strive for the color that you see on your cheeks.

, Use an eyeshadow that is a shade slightly darker than your skin tone. Gently swipe the eyeshadow on your eyelid, to lift your eyes a little. Then apply a mascara that is similar to your eyelash color (if you have brown eyelashes use a dark-brown mascara or a brown-black). Sometimes Shakira will just use an eyelash curler and skip the mascara.


If you can get away without using eyeshadow, try it. Sometimes natural beauty is the best, but you can make your eyes look a little more alive by applying a thin layer of mascara.

, Shakira uses a light pink on her lips, just enough color to make her lips pop. Choose a color of lipstick or lipgloss that is only slightly darker than your actual lip color. Then, apply it to your lips and blot it out with a napkin or tissue until you can't blot any more out. You can use a lip gloss to add a little shine to your lips.

, Shakira has honey-blonde hair with sun-kissed highlights. To achieve this similar look, bleach your hair, but not a platinum blonde, and add some highlights and low lights to your hair. If you hair is already blonde, then just add some low lights to achieve the different dimensions of Shakira's hair. Some of her lowlights have a reddish tent, so consider doing a mixture of dark blonde and strawberry blond low lights.Shakira does a really good job of making her hair look natural -- it doesn't seem obvious that she's naturally a brunette. When bleaching or coloring your hair, strive for a shade of blonde that looks natural with your skin tone and eyebrow color. Even if you can't get Shakira's exact color, it's better to follow her in the sense that her hair doesn't look unnatural.
Shakira has had several different hair styles and hair colors, so you may be looking for one of her darker, shorter cuts. Shakira has been a brunette with highlights, has had very short hair, and has had extremely curly hair. You can achieve any of her looks by visiting a professional to color and cut your hair, or you can do it yourself by buying a boxed dye and highlighting kit.

, Shakira is a fan of avoiding harsh chemicals when it comes to taking care of her hair. She uses sulfate-free shampoo on her hair and refrains from using products with alcohols as they can dry out your hair. To really get Shakira's hair, try to go for natural serums and products for your hair.


Aloe vera, coconut oil, shea butter, honey, and vegetable glycerin are all natural products that can provide moisture and improve the health of your hair., Shakira's most recent hairstyle that causes envy from others is her long hair. If you have short hair, overtime you can grow it out like Shakira's so that you can achieve the same wavy look as hers. To grow your hair long, follow these tips:Consider taking supplements for your hair. There are different vitamins you can take to improve hair growth, some of which are Biotin and Niacin. Take one of these supplements daily to help boost your hair growth. Keep in mind that it might promote hair growth in other places on your body as well!
Get regular trims. It may seem strange to cut your hair regularly when you are growing it out, but your hair will be healthier and it will prevent split ends from working their way up your hair. If you go a long time without trimming your hair, your hair may begin breaking off. Make sure you get a trim every 10 to 12 weeks.
Don't shampoo your hair daily, and always use conditioner. Some people feel they need to shampoo their hair every day, but in truth it is healthier for your hair if you shampoo it every other day or longer. This allows the natural oils to be restored in your hair, which keeps the strands healthy. Do condition your hair every time you shower though, as conditioner will help prevent excessive damage from heating products and coloring.
Do a cold rinse at the end of each shower. Turn your shower to cold and rinse your hair for a few seconds. The cold water will lay down the outer layer of your hair smoothly, preventing moisture loss, snags, and heat damage.
Apply a weekly oil or mask treatment. Sometimes conditioning your hair in the shower is not enough and it needs extra care, especially if you have long hair. Mix one cup of unrefined coconut oil mixed with one tablespoon each of almond, macadamia and jojoba oil. Then, apply to damp hair, leave on for ten minutes, and rinse out with shampoo and conditioner. You can also buy an oil based treatment at your local drug or cosmetics store.
Don't put your hair up too often. Wearing a ponytail every now and then is okay, but because it usually causes tension in your hair by pulling it, it can damage your hair or make it more prone to breakage overtime. So, when wearing your ponytail make sure it is not too tight. A low ponytail is better for your hair.

, Shakira has been praised for her beautiful, wavy, long locks that look so natural. If your hair has a wave to it, try styling it naturally by applying serums with natural oils. You can also achieve a naturally wavy look by braiding your hair when it is wet and letting it dry in the braid. Then, when you undo your braid your hair will have long, flowing waves. You can also use styling products to achieve a wavy look:If your hair is not naturally wavy, you can try a number of different things to achieve the wavy look. When you shower, use a shampoo that will help you achieve that wavy look like Herbal Essences Tousle Me Softly. Then, towel dry your hair and spritz with spray gel, or if you have very straight hair apply a volumizing mousse and comb through with a wide tooth comb.
Dry your hair with a diffuser, flipping your hair over and trying not to touch it so that you don't create too much frizziness in your hair. You can also use a round brush while blow drying your hair to achieve a wavy look. Roll the brush away from your face when blow drying sections of your hair, and then use a 3/4 inch curling iron to curl sections of your hair, starting a few inches past the root. For a more natural look, comb fingers through your curls once you are done curling your hair.
To achieve a really wavy look, wrap two inch sections of hair up into tiny buns and pin them to your head with bobby pins. Then, blast a blow dryer on each section until the bobby pins feel hot. Allow the mini buns to cool down before you unwind them.

, Shakira gets much of her exercise from the dancing that she does on tour, so to look like Shakira, sign up for some dance lessons. Shakira combines different dance styles like the Samba and other Spanish-influenced dance forms, hip hop, and belly dancing. Watch some of Shakira's videos and take lessons in these types of dance so that you can mimic her dance style., Even after Shakira had her baby, her body was in shape. To look like Shakira you'll want to exercise and go for a similar body type. While Shakira is curvy, she has toned hips and thighs and a flat stomach, which give her an hour glass shape. Along with exercises to target specific muscle groups you can do these routines to improve your health and body shape:Zumba: Shakira claims that she did Zumba throughout her pregnancy and after her pregnancy she did it four to five times a week. Take a Zumba class at your local gym -- it's a great form of exercise!
Eat eight small meals a day: Instead of having three large meals throughout the day, Shakira eats eight small meals packed with fiber, calcium, iron, and protein. This helped to keep her metabolism boosted.

, To get Shakira's toned stomach, do 15 to 20 minutes of ab exercises at least three times a week. Some effective ab exercises to achieve that hourglass shape and flat tummy are:Leg lifts: Lie on your back and extend your legs out in front of you. Then, keeping your legs straight, lift them into the air, targeting your lower abs. Lower legs back to the floor, but don't let them touch the ground. You'll want to keep your back flat while doing this (don't use your back strength because it can hurt your back), so if you need extra help, place both your hands underneath your tailbone.
Waist whittlers: Get in plank position, with your elbows on the ground and your hands together. Then, twist your waist so that one side hits the ground below you, and then twist to the other side. Make sure your back is flat and that you aren't arching your butt down or up.
Russian twists: Sit on your butt with your knees bent in front of you. Then, slowly lean back, keeping your stomach and back flat, and lift your legs so that your feet are a few inches off the ground. Keep your knees bent, and twist from side to side, touching the floor on each side with both hands as you go.
Cross body crunches: Lie on your back with your hands behind your neck and legs straight in front of you. Then, lift both legs off the ground and bring your left knee towards your nose. As you do this, lift your right shoulder off the ground and reach it as close to your left knee as possible. Then, do the same action on the right side, going from left to right and back to the left at a fast pace.

, Shakira has curvy hips and thighs, but they are made of toned muscle, so she looks healthy and in shape. To tone your lower body like Shakira, do these exercises:


Squats: You can do plié squats, sumo squats, or narrow squats. Either place your feet next to each other, place them in a wide stance, or stay on your toes while you squat and squat as low as you can, keeping your back straight. Do as many reps of these as you can.
Leg circles: Begin by getting on your knees and extending one leg out to the side. Then, place the opposite hand on the ground so that your body weight is on that arm. Lift your extended leg up to the height of your hip and then make small circles in the air for about a minute. To make it even harder, after you have done circles, keep your leg extended and bend your knee so that your lower leg comes back towards your body. Then, extend it out again.
Fire hydrant: Place your hands on the ground in front of you, in line with your shoulders, with your legs bent and your knees on the ground. Then, lift one leg to the side, keeping it bent, and lower back down to the ground. (Imagine you are a dog peeing on a fire hydrant if that helps).

, Shakira knows how to achieve a sexy look without being overtly sexy -- she usually wears tight fitting clothes, but in a modest, classy way. Because Shakira has great abs, she sometimes wears shirts that show her stomach, and she tends to wear tight jeans or pants to show off her curves.To really achieve Shakira's look, wear shirts that are somewhat loose, tight jeans, and a pair of sexy heals or boots. Shakira tends to wear neutral tones -- blacks, dark blues, and grays. She also loves her fun, wide brimmed hats. When it comes to dressing up, Shakira tends to wear tight fitting dresses that cling to her curves in an appealing way.
If you still aren't sure what to wear, try searching for images of Shakira and copying some of her outfits.

, One of Shakira's greatest attributes is her confidence. She believes a great smile and positivity are the best beauty tips. To truly look like Shakira you need to be confident in who you are and show people that confidence is more important than perfection., Shakira wrote her first song at age eight and signed her first record deal at age 13. Her first two albums weren't very successful, but she continued to push forward and her third album became a hit. As you can see, Shakira took risks, even though she knew she might experience failure. To really imitate Shakira, be adventurous and pursue the things that you are passionate about, even though you may not succeed right away., Shakira has a Lebanese father and Colombian mother, and in her music she stays true to her heritage, bringing in her Latino and Arabic background. Shakira is proud of where she came from, and so to emulate Shakira, you should learn to be proud of your background as well. Even when Shakira really hit stardom, she still incorporated her heritage into her music.


You can also learn more about Shakira's background and strive to incorporate her culture into your life if you want to understand her more.

, This goes beyond looking like Shakira in appearance, but is more about carrying the same attitude as Shakira, which helps give her confidence. Shakira has created the Pies Descalzos (Barefoot) foundation, which provides education to children in impoverished countries. She has also founded Alas, and served as an ambassador for Unicef. So, if you really want to look like Shakira and emulate her, find a charity to donate to and join in their efforts. Think about the things you have a passion for or find important and choose a charity based on that. Contributing to others doesn't have to just be monetarily either. You can serve your community with your time and energy as well.

Everyone is different and what looks great on Emily (Shay Mitchell) may not look great on you.Just try a foundation or bb cream,some concealer to any imperfection and set it with powder. Then line your eyes with a black liner or eye kohl, curl your lashes and apply two coats of mascara(you can try a clear mascara)Apply a peachy pink blush and then use a tinted lipbalm or lipgloss.

, Use curlers if you want to add a little more body and life to your hair, but don't over-do it. Use larger sections of your hair in order to create bigger, fuller and more natural looking curls. Lately, Emily got caramel ombre tips and she has been curling her hair from about halfway down with a straight, sleek, and silky top. Finish off with a little spritz of hairspray.

, I am absolutely in love with her transformation and hope her style continues to get even more edgy. Emily has kept a couple aspects of her wardrobe the same though. Comfort is key. The thing is, she has been looking more fashionable lately while still being comfy. Look for cute cutouts, soft fabrics, layers, etc. Emily has been adding cute patters to the pants she wears as well, whether they are metallic leggings or Aztec printed jeans. Another thing about Emily is her new favourite colour: black! Now I'm not saying you need to wear all black but definitely include it somewhere. An example could be when she wore a black tank with bright blue jeans. Add some colour to brighten up your outfit! For accessories; Emily loves bigger bags, think a hobo or cross body bag. Also, add mostly delicate accessories however some bigger, edgy, rings would be acceptable.

,)Maybe just don't do crazy nail art or extra bright shades of polish!You can try a french manicure though.

, In the television series, Emily's room is always clean and tidy. She has a large desk in her room which holds souvenirs and keep-sakes from friends, including the snow-globe Alison gave her. Her bedroom is painted with light colors, yellows and whites. If you have spare money and time, you could try to imitate her bedroom. There are stills from the show on the official Pretty Little Liars website.

",How to Look Like Selena Gomez," Selena is known for her huge, dark, shiny eyes, so give your eyes a beautiful natural shine by applying two cold cucumber slices. (or two cold, wet cotton balls) Pull your hair back, lay down, and gently press them against your closed eyelids. Count to fifty slowly, then pull them away; your eyes will have a natural shine.


Remember that your eyes don't have to be brown. Blue, green, grey, and hazel eyes are just as pretty.;
, Make sure your eyes are dry then select a quality eye shadow. (Don't go and buy some cheap eye shadow at a gas station. If you want a flattering Gomez look, you might need to pinch a couple pennies to afford it.) First apply a lighter color to the lids, then apply a darker color to the creases. Be sure the tones suit your eye color.

, Get a black or dark brown eyeliner to match Selena’s style. Line both the top and bottom of your eyelids, but don't overdo it. (especially if you really want to look like her)

, Get a high-quality mascara and dip the wand in. Set it near your eyelash and blink until there is enough mascara on your eyelashes for you.

, Selena has a naturally full mouth, but there are cheap ways to emulate the look. Get about a teaspoon of sugar or salt. Lick your lips twice and kiss the spoon of salt or sugar, until the majority of it is on your lips. Rub your lips together until they are slightly numb, then rinse them thoroughly. Also, every time you brush your teeth, brush your lips for three minutes.

, Buy a moisturizing lip balm with SPF and use it whenever your lips get dry or chapped. Don't lick your lips! It may be tempting, but it dries out your lips.

, Finish your lips off with a nice lip gloss. Go to any beauty store and buy lip gloss. When buying the gloss, don't make it super-shiny. Keep it moderately glossy, as Selena likes to keep her look natural.

, Then you have pinkish lips like her..

, Selena is very fresh-faced, so the best place to start is with a natural glow. Buy a good acne cleanser and use at least once daily. If you have sensitive skin, ask your doctor or dermatologist what cleanser you should use.

, Buy a lightweight moisturizer and apply it to your face after you've applied the cleanser. This will help keep your skin moisturized and will avoid dry, flaky skin. Make sure that it's lightweight so that your face doesn't get too oily.

, Use a sheer foundation that matches your skin color and apply it to your face, concentrating on areas like your nose and under eyes. Put on a bronze or dusty-rose blush if your skin tone is like Selena's; otherwise, go for a color that suits your skin tone better.


If your complexion is already even, avoid foundation; it may dull your natural vibrancy.

, ""Done"" eyebrows make your eyes look bigger and your makeup pop. If you don’t want to shape your own eyebrows, have them waxed. (If you’re under thirteen, you can also have them strung.)


Only pluck your eyebrows if you want to and are ready for it.

, Selena has sleek, shiny hair that looks great with or without styling. Keep your hair healthy by washing and conditioning it according to its needs (ex. thin, dry, oily, and dyed hair all have different needs).


Selena says that she uses ""Hello Hydration."" Of course, just because it works for her hair doesn’t mean it’ll work for yours.

, Luckily for you, Selena has worn her hair in a variety of styles including long, shoulder-length, layered, straight, and wavy with front bangs, side bangs, and no bangs at all. Look through some photos of her over the years to choose a style that flatters your face shape.


To achieve the straight-haired look, buy a good flat iron and some heat protection (so your hair doesn't get frizzy or damaged). Apply the heat protection to your hair. Once the straightener has heated up, straighten your hair.
To achieve a wavy look, buy a good heat wand as well as heat protection. Apply the heat protection to your hair. Wrap different sections of your hair around the wand and, when you’re done, spray with hairspray or shine-spray to hold the kinks.

, Selena has a great sense of style (and it's actually pretty affordable!). Search for pictures of Selena online to see what you like, what would flatter your body type, and what’s in your budget. Circle the items you like in certain pictures. Do you love the skinny jeans she's wearing in that picture? Or maybe the cardigan? Get inspired by her before going out shopping.

, Selena wears skinny jeans, scarves, heels, and anything else that is frilly or girly. It's a good idea to shop at teenage stores like American Eagle, Forever 21, Urban Outfitters, Garage, Aeropostale, etc., which are all fairly affordable. If you have a higher budget, try going for stores like Abercrombie and Juicy Couture. Selena loves shopping at Abercrombie and Juicy for occasional clothing.

, When you talk, sway your torso from left to right, and lean your head towards the person you are talking to. When you get upset, talk extremely fast, with a high-pitched voice. When you get angry or frustrated, say ""Frick,"" ""Frick on a stick,"" ""Frick on a stick with a brick,"" ""Mother frick,"" or any other variation. When you are happy, say ""All right!"" or ""Coolio"" in a slightly high-pitched voice, and clasp your hands together. Gasp slightly (as in very slightly) before each sentence.

, When you mean to whisper, hiss and make your eyes huge.

In regards to hair, a bolder color is better.,
If you cut your hair, the cut of the hair can be left to the discretion of your stylist- tell him or her that you want a sleek style, maybe with a bit of an edge.",How to Be Like Emily from Skins1," While Emily keeps a purplish red, other rich, expressive colors will do. Dark brown, black, bleach blond, or even deep blues and purples will work, as long as they are done with polish, are well suited to your skin tone, and are carried with confidence.;
, Emily's characteristic asymmetrical bangs are a start. Other options include a shaggy bob or even, if you're up for it, a bold pixie cut.


Bows, headbands, and cute clips are easily found in most stores and are usually cheap, so stock up- they are a key component in Emily's style.







"
"
Look for bright skirts with stripes, flowers, or other pleasing patterns.,
On top, plain or vintage tees and tank tops are always a great bet.,
Cardigans, also, are a must in emulating Emily's style.,
A nice, fitted black coat is acceptable, as is a classy scarf in blue or red- anything bright and cheerful.,
Emily has a wide variety of shoes.",How to Be Like Emily from Skins2," Bright high-waisted shorts are another lovely option. Be on the lookout for sweet dresses in quirky patterns or adorned with bows or buttons. Under these, during the colder seasons, plain black, bright neon, or cute lace tights can be used to keep your legs warm.

, Urban Outfitters and Topshop are great places to look. Collared blouses with cute patterns are also a great addition.

, Stock up on the basic colors- gray, black, and tan- and also find a few bright colors such as green or purple. If you can find a nice, vintage denim jacket, those are excellent to finish most outfits (as long as you aren't wearing denim on the bottom as well).

, Outerwear is a tricky topic to address because Emily hardly wears an actual coat and scarf. If you can find gloves or hats with a sweet pattern or bows, go for it! Go with your gut.

, She likes cute flats and whimsical heels- look for bows, and definitely shop vintage and thrift. If you prefer to wear sneakers, bright or vintage is better- Converse is acceptable, but not ideal. Bright or patterned plimsolls are great. If you live in a particularly rainy area, wellies or rain boots are fine if done right. Try to find ones that are one solid color that suits the rest of your wardrobe.

There are several different makeup looks that may be emulated when one is using Emily Fitch as inspiration.",How to Be Like Emily from Skins3,"

Lips: A natural or pink gloss is a safe bet. For special occasion or if you're just feeling particularly dressy, a deep berry or magenta lipstick could be applied sparingly.






Eyes: A moderate amount of black or purple eyeliner can be applied on the top lid, with a small wing if desired. A soft, smoky eyeshadow is optional. Make sure to keep your eyebrows groomed and neat.






Face: Keep your face smooth and unblemished- if you have zits, obviously, treat them and apply cover up. A light powder or foundation is optional- make sure, however, not to cross the line into cakey makeup. A light coat of berry colored blush right on the apples of your cheeks will give you an extra boost of cuteness.

Shirts: We usually see her wearing spaghetti straps with a sweater or jacket on top and long sleeved blouses. Her usual colours are dark blue, purple, brown, dark green, dark red, black, etc. She's not big on bright colours. Although in the episode where she's kidnapped by Trevor she is wearing a light pink sweater and a white tank top underneath.
Pants: Jeans, black or brown pants, sweatpants (only at home)
Shoes: In almost every episode Elena is wearing Converse shoes. You don not have to wear Converse everyday; you can switch from Converse to Vans, or even sandals. But remember: it's all about being like Elena.
Dresses: Buy pretty and fancy dresses. Nothing that shows too much, not too long either. Make it a little sexy but still classy. Elena is never seen showing her parts to everyone.;
, Elena has clear skin and medium coverage makeup. Not too little but not too much. Search for tutorials on YouTube based on Elena's makeup and wear the one that you like and suits you the best. For clean skin try washing your face every morning and every night with a gentle soap or face cleanser, but be careful not to dry your face too much.


Hair: Elena's hair is dark brown and sleek parted near the middle. If you have a lighter colour try dying it dark brown or you can just leave it natural. She has brown eyes.

, Elena wakes up every morning at 6:45am. She isn't lazy and gets things done straight away!

, Elena is adopted but she loved her parents before they died. She cared about them and also her brother Jeremy. She looks out for her friends Bonnie and Caroline and she's willing to die for them. She's nice and warm but strong, brave and determined when she has to. Never mean or obnoxious. She never tries to be the center of attention or make people feel bad in any way. She dislikes her real parents. She loves her boyfriend Damon and has a friendship with his brother Stefan,even though he's her ex., too.

Soon, they start dating and they had the cutest little hate love relationship ever! Damon is seen as rude and standoffish to everyone but Elena, she sees the good in him and she makes him a better person and he brings out the wild side in her, and he's willing to do anything to protect her and keep you safe from any harm. Don't settle for anything less than that. Never go out of your comfort zone or flirt with any other guy. Whether she was with Stefan or with Damon, #TeamDelenaEndgame!, she always remained completely faithful to her significant other so never go out of your way to cheat on your partner.

She has a badass vampire boyfriend, her boyfriend's brother is her ex., her best friend is a witch and her other close friend is a vampire.

Carly loves lip gloss!,
Carly cares very much about her friends.,
Carly always plans things well.,
Carly loves shopping.,
Sing!,
Always be neat and and organized at school, at home, and help others who need it.

",How to Be Like Carly Shay," Carly styles and combs and brushes it very well everyday, as to not letting it get ratty or have split ends, or at any matter, looking like she rolled out of bed. You must wash your hair only every other day because washing it everyday could cause your hair to dry out terribly and break. Always utilize a shampoo that is appropriate and works well for your hair type, and be sure to always leave in your conditioner for exactly three minutes to get a healthy, soft glow and feel while you're washing your body in the shower or bath, and rinse it out afterwards with very cold water, as cold water is better for your hair than hot water. (It seals in shine better and is more of help to your hair roots.) Whenever you want your hair to be down (Carly almost always wears her hair down), feel free to smooth it out with a flat iron. However, you must be very careful when using hot hair tools such as flat irons, as they may dry out your hair badly if you do not use them properly and efficiently. Always use a specific natural hair oil for your hair type (such as argan oil) to soften and protect your hair when using a flat-iron or other hot hair tools. Remember, your hair is a very important thing, and you absolutely must take very good care of it. Also, if you are younger, you can pin your hair back with bobby pins. Carly was often seen wearing her hair like this in the earlier seasons.;
, Carly is an extremely kind and friendly girl, but she can be sarcastic sometimes. Always try to crack jokes, because even though sometimes they're not uproariously hilarious, Carly always tries. Try to make a joke out of everything, but don't go too far. This can lead to misunderstandings and even fights. You can watch some videos to see her sense of humor, if you'd like.

, Carly is quite clean, has flawless skin, and wears very neat, key makeup. Always take showers/baths everyday, because Carly would never not take one. Do brush your teeth in the morning and at night with a decent brand of toothpaste because Carly has pearly white teeth, and always wash your face in the morning and also at night before you go to bed to make sure no pimples or blackheads show up on your skin, all the while using a face lotion with sunscreen in it to put on your face to keep it moisturized. Wear deodorant everyday as well to prevent perspiration and obnoxious odor, because Carly would never, ever, ever have sweaty, smelly, disgusting armpits. You might also want to shave certain areas of your body using a good-quality razor and shaving lotion, and apply a good-quality moisturizing body lotion to all parts of your body everyday.

, Carly is known for her brilliant ideas such as starting her very own web-show iCarly, so you might want to try to think of new, cool, and interesting ideas. She's full of creativity, so sign up for some kind of class such as sewing, crafting, or even learning a new language! If you do that one, try learning French, Mandarin, or Spanish, because Carly is known for trying to learn those.

, She is known for often wearing flats, black and white checkered vans, and nice boots. Starting in Season 2 (14 years. old), Carly loves to pair flirty skirts with mid-calf boots. Layer clothes a lot - but don't overdo it! You don't want to look like a clown. Try to also wear a lot of different patterns and colors, so you can stick out. Be creative and fun with what you wear!

, Carly tends to wear skirts a lot, so try floral or printed skirts. Be very feminine and girly whenever you wear clothes, and never dress like a tomboy (unless you are wishing to be like Samantha ""Sam"" Puckett, Carly's tomboyish best friend in the show). All of this information ties back to Step 5, so read that section again. Create outfits like Carly's and lay them all out so you can dress a little more like Carly, but remember that you are definitely your own person!

, Carly is very intelligent, and she always works hard and well in school, because she wishes for highly excellent grades on all of her exams and assignments. Try not to get into detention. If you need help in school, you could ask for help, or you could maybe try tutoring for classes in order to improve your academic effort in the class. You don't have to be the brainiest or greatest in school, nor do you have to be an overachiever, but you still need to have the best grades that you can get. Don't be afraid to ask questions, as they help you acquire knowledge and view the world in a different way. Help your friends with any assistance, too, because they might need it, and Carly would surely do that.

, Carly wears make-up everyday, and her make-up is girly and very natural. She generally wears a foundation that works with her skin tone, concealer, brown/white eyeshadows, face powder, a little brown pencil eyeliner, thin layers of mascara, and high-shine pink lip gloss. She also sometimes wears pink blush. Try wearing those cosmetics. However, if you don't want to wear any make-up at all, which is okay, always keep your face clean, shiny, and acne-free. (This goes along with the information that is in Step 3).
, Carly is very benevolent, polite, mature and respectful to adults and to children, and she never attempts to hurt anyone's feelings. However, at some times, once in a while, Carly can be snappy to people who just don't acknowledge her point of view and upset her, ex. Nora in iPsycho, Daka Company in iPromote Techfoots, Rona in iChristmas and Austin in iSpeed Date. Don't ever be discourteous to people, and think about calm thoughts if you are ever about to lose your temper and explode.

, Carly loves coffee, although she doesn't know that her supervisor always makes sure that it's decaffeinated. Also eat vegetarian pizzas and drink smoothies. Watch iCarly to find some of her favorite foods. (For example, in the episode ""iWill Date Freddie,"" she and her friends are seen eating half a watermelon with spoons.) Try to drink juice a lot, and also never drink water without ice!

, Carly is shown often sitting anywhere in her apartment, typing away on her ""PearBook"". It will also let you appear more internet-saavy, which Carly is- after all, she did start her own web-show! Try to spend a lot of time on the internet. Carly loves and always will love being on the internet! If you have a couch or a beanbag chair, always click away on that chair. Carly has lots of gadgets, such as the ""PearPhone"" or the ""PearPad"". But of course, you don't need to only use the internet for schoolwork and how-to's - have fun! Watch funny videos, play games, update your Facebook or Twitter if you have it.

, Work on your gloss collection. You often see Carly glossing up her lips. She also likes mixing flavors; she makes a piña colada gloss out of a coconut and a pineapple-flavored one.

Choose what hairstyle you want to emulate.,
Dress like Zoey.,
Get Zoey's trademark key necklace.,
Try tanning.",How to Act Like Zoey Brooks1," Zoey has two hairstyles and either one will do. One is from the earlier seasons of Zoey 101, and it is shoulder-length beach blonde. The second style is the most recent, and it is brown with a few blonde streaks, layered. Both styles are rather low maintenance. If your hair isn't naturally one of these colors, dying it is optional. Just don't go too extreme.;
, Zoey wears tank tops, mini-skirts, and sneakers. She has a typical Southern California Girl style and is really cute. Don't show too much skin - Zoey doesn't.


If you live in a cooler climate, make sure you have fall and winter clothes. Try wearing a bright sweater or thermal, dark jeans, black all-purpose boots and a parka.
Whatever the weather, the key is to appear laid back and along the lines between girly and tomboy.

, The necklace is not much more than her dorm key painted with a cute design an on a neck chain. Odds are, you're too young to live in a dorm, so you can use your house key or apartment key instead. Better yet, do something original and get your own trademark accessory like a charm bracelet or special ring.

, Zoey is very tanned. Don't go to a tanning salon, it ruins your skin. Use a good-quality self-tanner.

Speak with a slight Southern drawl or twang.,
Copy her personality.,
Get a couple of gadgets.,
Be caring towards others.",How to Act Like Zoey Brooks2," Jamie Lynn Spears is from Louisiana, so Zoey has a slight Southern twang to her voice that makes her very charming. Make sure to practice your drawl and be proud if you already have one (odds are good if you live in the Midwest or South). Just work on it gradually so it doesn't seem fake, and don't make it so thick that you sound like someone from Green Acres.

, Zoey is a sweet girl, but can be tricky and sarcastic when she needs to be. She's also full of energy and is never scared to stand up for herself or other people. If you have some of these traits already, bring them out a little more often; try to work on these things if you don't have them already.

, Zoey emails friends and relatives from PCA a lot, so a good quality laptop is a must. It also comes in handy for social media and assignments, helps you seem organized, and saves time.


A smartphone or flip phone would be nice as it resembles the Tech-Mate she had in the ""Spring Break Up"" special. Get it in a cute color or buy a nice case for it. Just make sure it doesn't end up in the water like Zoey's did.

, Zoey is always ready to help cheer people up and is particularly fond of her brother, Dustin. Have good relationships with your family and friends.

Copy Aria's style of hair.,
Try to use the same style of makeup as used by Aria.,
Consider getting into shape.,
Get the wardrobe.,
Develop the outgoing yet mysterious side of your personality.,
Travel as much as you possible can.,
Read widely and well.,
Write as often as you can.,
Get into photography.",How to Be Like Aria Montgomery," Aria has long, curly dark hair. Grow out your hair, but occasionally you can get it trimmed to avoid split ends. Change your shampoo and conditioner and/or dye it to make it more similar to Aria's.


Aria normally has loosely curled hair, so it would be best to curl your hair with a large barrel curling iron. You could also use a hydrating, curl-holding product after showering.
Aria also has long, side-swept bangs. You can keep the shape of these by combing them into position while they're wet, putting a round brush under them, and blow drying, before gently applying hairspray.;
,


Eyes: Apply a smokey black eyeshadow just along the top of your lash line to make your eyes look big like Aria's. Use flesh-toned eyeliner on your waterline to make them look doe-like. Blend a pink or brown tone into the crease of your eyes.
Face: Put on peach or light pink blush, a little cool-toned shadow under your natural cheekbones as a contour, temples and on both sides of your nose and blend well.
Lips: Either nude or pink lipstick depending on the day.
Eyebrows: Aria's eyebrows are very defined. Try shaping yours along your natural arch by plucking, waxing, or threading, then fill in any sparse bits with a brow powder or pencil.
Nails: Aria's nails are mostly darkly colored. Black is her most basic choice, although she also uses different colors like dark gray, deep plum, rich burgundy and deep blue. Always keep your nails clean and trim.

, Aria is in great shape. If you aren't quite as in shape as Aria, it's okay. Part of her personality is being different. But you can still eat healthy and exercise like Aria, who likes to do yoga.

, Aria is very unique and likes wearing clothes stand out. Her style is mainly Bohemian, but with an indie-hipster twist. Research those styles, and get some basic Bohemian clothes.


Get a signature leather jacket (Aria's is a gray bomber, which can go with almost anything).
Try out second-hand/thrift stores for unique vintage pieces.
Be bold. One thing Aria is known for is the confidence behind her clothes!

, Aria is sweet and funny, emotional but strong, and mysterious but friendly. and unique. People are drawn to her friendly attitude. She is also a total romantic. However, she is also quite secretive. Try to incorporate these things into your own attitude.

, Aria's exotic style comes from the variety of the cultures she's experienced. Try to travel as much as possible and always pick up souvenirs on the way: jewelry, clothing, and other trinkets. If you can't travel IRL, travel online by chatting to people from all around the world and learning as much as you can about their lives and experiences.


With a charm bracelet, you can show off the places you have visited. Pile more bracelets on top of it to create a very Bohemian stacked look.

, Aria's room is full of books, so read as much as you can. One of Aria's favorite books is The Great Gatsby. Some of Aria's favorite authors are Jean Paul Sartre, Camus, Beckett, and Ayn Rand. She also loves classic literature like the work of Edgar Allan Poe, William Shakespeare, and Jane Austen.


Go see some classic plays, as well, such as ""Romeo & Juliet,"" ""Waiting for Godot,"" and ""No Exit."" Plays, after all, are a form of literature.

, Aria keeps a detailed journal of her life. Start your own journal and add to it whenever you can.

, Try to get into photography classes, internships, and/or competitions.


Aria's love for film noir influences her work-- especially ""It Happened One Night.""

Develop your intellect.,
Be observant.,
Filter out unnecessary information.,
Study forensic science.,
Act smart.,
Respond quickly.,
Appear neutral at all times.,
Don't show any signs of caring too much.,
Show people what you know.,
Have your own sense of style.",How to Act Like Sherlock Holmes," While Sherlock Holmes is a lot of things, he is nothing without his mind (the rest is merely appendix). If you are going to be Sherlock Holmes, you're going to need an IQ roughly over twice your height in inches, and you're going to need to know how to use this intellect. It's all well and fair to be smart, but being intelligent (that is, the ability to process information, not just random factoids you've kept around for no reason) is key. But don't worry, you can build this up... it simply takes practice. The brain is a muscle: exercise it.;
, Notice small details, because those all lead to the bigger picture. Details are what tie together people's lives. So, if you want to have a little fun with it, maybe bring up the question of ""How's your dog?"" to a person who you noticed has obvious dog hairs left on their clothing. (This only works the way you want it if you haven't ever been to this person's house, because then it just seems like you genuinely want to know about how their dog is doing since you've actually seen the dog.)


The other half of Holmes' utter genius (apart from actually being a genius) is his ability to pick up details, and then transpose fact into conjecture, using the science of deduction. Learn to spot these details which become facts, and use intellect to narrow down possible causes until you've extrapolated something about that person which you didn't previously know.







, Some may think that mostly all information is necessary but Sherlock would disagree. He needs room for the important stuff, so he ""deletes"" or ""filters out"" the rest. So if someone is talking to you, you can listen but you don't have to remember every. single. thing. they say to you. Remember: Leave room for the important things. Remember only that which matters.

, If you really want to be a hardcore clone to Sherlock, then look into that. But basically it's a study of information from the past that ties together a crime that took place. That's the field that Sherlock studied so that's a big part of ""being like Sherlock"". The subject is fascinating.


Acquire some chemistry lab supplies, or access, and of course some knowledge of chemistry. Chemistry is utterly important to Holmes, and now especially in this day and age when chemistry can be used to analyze blood, soil, pollen, et cetera, it is imperative to have an excellent grasp of all things chemical, to aid in you in crime solving.







, This is as simple as it sounds. It works in literally any case scenario, even in group discussions. Act like the smartest person in the room. People will either admire you or flat out hate you. If this sounds like the life you want, then go for it. Use sophisticated sounding responses and big words all in a monotone voice and you're guaranteed to sound smart.

, Sherlock's responses are always fast yet perfect, because he tends to add a tad of his personality into every one of them. They're usually all in a monotone voice, so showing hardly any emotion in conversations is kind of his style.

, Avoid extreme facial expressions. You don't necessarily need to keep a poker face 24/7, just maybe... 23/7? Keeping a poker face most of the time causes people to actually want to get a reaction out of you. It keeps them guessing. It makes you unreadable. Plus, when you finally do act surprised or shocked, it balances out the blank expressions and highlights the fact that you are, overall, confident in the way you think. Therefore, making you seem smarter. And so you can easily perpetuate the illusion.

, This may sound apathetic and uninvolved and that's because it is. Sherlock hardly takes consideration into people's lives unless it is dire. So maybe use phrases such as ""I see"", ""That's nice"", ""Splendid"", but all with a touch of distraction––avoid appearing overly interested or enthusiastic. This technique helps you to maintain a clinical distance from the subjects being studied, to avoid subjectivity which could spoil examination of the facts.

, Being a genius and highly skilled is only half the fun. The most important part, and what really makes Holmes, well, Holmes, is the fact that he knows just how to go about showing it. It's not what a man has done, but a man can make you think he has done, that truly matters. Learn the art of showing what you know... without making it obvious that you are insecure about yourself and are showing off to gain approval from others. This is key.

, You may be wondering how you can have your own style and also copy what Sherlock wears. That's easy. Sherlock wears mostly darker colours, a dark scarf, long, dark coat, etc. But if you want to sort of make it your own, then you can maybe throw in a signature colour or accessory that's outside of Sherlock's wardrobe. Or you can just copy exactly what Sherlock wears.

Don't think!,
Finally.,
Finished.

",How to Be Inspired By Bam Margera," The main thing about Bam's personality is that he never seems to be unhappy or depressed. He is completely the opposite, being happy, hyper and VERY energetic! A way to do this is to do all the things you enjoy doing, whether it being skateboarding, reading, game playing etc anything and everything you enjoy doing, do it! Your mood will increase making you feel better about yourself and happier. Also it's a good idea to find a sport you enjoy doing as it will make your mood better and at the same time it will improve your physical health, hence making you more energetic.;
, Bam's reason for his behaviour is simple: in the introduction to Viva La Bam the narrator says ""Bam Margera: What will he do next?"" and Bam simply replies ""Whatever the f*** I want!"". Making sure that you don't get yourself into trouble, just do whatever you feel like! Break rules, do the opposite of what people say or ask. Even do something completely random or bizarre, like crushing a chocolate bar in your hands and throwing the remaining on the floor. If you feel like doing something either with or without a reason, then just do it! Be yourself and be proud of it!

, Bam's fashion is one of his trademarks: he wears either a black top hat or visor, wears a lot of HIM-influenced gothic clothing, and has his own brand of Adio skate shoes. Go through your wardrobe and be creative! Try on everything, experiment, and eventually come up with a style that suits you and that you feel comfortable with. And remember, it's your choice what you wear so if someone doesn't like it and complains about it, just laugh in their face and say you don't give a crap, cause YOU like it!

, Bam loves himself and his life, but he doesn't go on about how perfect he thinks everything about him is. Learn to accept and appreciate what you have and love it. And if there's anything you don't like, either find ways to improve it or just leave it. Be positive and smile!

, There are some points in life where you do need to think before you act, but most of the time, don't! Bam just goes along with it and laughs with it. He doesn't think about it. And that creates humour and confidence. Just do whatever you want and don't think about anything! Laugh the through the pain and enjoy your time!

, go crazy!

Create a new identity.",How to Be Inspired by the Smallville Clark Kent," Clark always listens to his parents and respects his parents no matter how annoying there rules can get, trust me, he gets annoyed a lot. His dad always told him not join the football team because he was afraid that that Clark would hurt someone by accident or reveal his secret. Have you ever disobeyed your parents and found serious consequences, that's why you should listen to your parents. But make sure they give you room to make mistakes and be your own person. It is all about growing up. And trust me, they been there. As impossible as this sounds, some parents actually want what's best for their kids.;
, You never know, It might be your future career choice. Clark always enjoyed journalism. It has always been one of Clark's major studies. He is a natural writer yet not as good a snoop as his friend Chloe. It is very important that you find something that interests you, it does not have to be the same as Clark, just choose something that gives you purpose.

, Your gifts make you special in your own way. You have a responsibility to use them for others. Oliver Queen had once said that with Clark's potential, you can't wait them to come to you. It takes time but Clark discovers that there is no greater calling than helping humanity. But that's totally your call. You don't have to be some hero. Just take action in helping others. You know that old saying. Watch your action, it will become your habits, Watch you habits, they become your character, and watch your character because it will become your Destiny. That's just it, you are responsible for your actions, for your destiny.

, Clark always felt pretty comfortable being the big brother figure. Help them with homework, play sports with the kid. Sky's the limit. Trust me you'll feel so awesome to help make a difference in some kids life. You never know, you might find a piece of yourself in them.

, It might be hard, but if you want to be like Clark you got to be able to trust those you tell those secrets. Clark highly values trust. But don't let it overwhelm you or you will end up like the ""Clark Relationship"". You need someone that you can be honest with, someone to share your trails and hardships, and I promise, if you find the real thing you are sure to soar. Find your Lois.

, Since you can't walk around public wearing a Superman suit (unless you were really that motivated), use Smallville's Clark as an example of what you can do. Clark is almost always seen wearing a combination of the primary colors. Most commonly it's a Red Jacket/Blue T-shirt, Blue Jacket/Red T-shirt, and a Yellow-Beige Jacket/Red or Blue T-shirt combination. Even during formal occasions, such as his graduation, he is wearing a Blue Shirt, Red Tie, and Yellow-Beige Trousers. You don't necessarily have to do that, but find a look that's exclusive to you: something that everyone else recognizes you by, even if it's something as simple as a hoodie you always wear (make sure you wash it though, Clark has a good sense of hygiene too). It's a lot less conspicuous then tights and a cape.

, Clark never put himself in a place where his classmates at Smallville High (or people in Smallville generally) ever had a reason to hold grudges against him or be mad at him (unless they were meteor freaks that were put into Belle Reve by him). Be friendly to everyone, and everyone should be friendly to you. Even if people aren't, just don't abandon the self righteous attitude and keep treating them the same way. If they continue to act unfriendly, try to put yourself in their shoes and understand if they might be going through a tough time in their life. Keep in mind all kids weren't raised by parents like Jonathan and Martha Kent, and not everyone is so lucky to have some of the luxuries of life that you do.

, Even your enemies. Clark has always been slightly too trusting, even to a fault. So yes even his enemies needed a chance. You have got to learn to forgive and forget, though even Clark has had trouble with doing that. They may just be looking for someone to save them. Who is Superman's greatest enemy? Lex Luthor. Who would have thought that they were once best friends, no, brothers. Even bad guys need someone to save them. Don't give up on them.

, In doing all these steps you find strengths in yourself that you never knew were there. You will also see what makes you weak. You can't ignore these things, or you will be doing a disservice to yourself and everyone around you. These gifts were meant to be used for the greater good. Clark had discovered that he had a purpose and was done running away from it, he was ready to walk into the world though not fully prepared. He decided to work at the Daily Planet so he could find those who needed him. But that was only the beginning, by accident he was exposed by a small degree and learned maybe the idea was someone out there saving people wasn't such a bad idea. The Red Blue Blur was born. Though you don't need to create an alias as Clark did it may be time to start a new life with a new identity, Clark was ready to take what new out into the world to make it a better place, and in doing so he was starting a new life. Maybe it's time to do the same.

Get clear skin.,
Look after your teeth.,
Get the right hairdo.,
Apply your makeup like a pro.,
Imitate her style.",How to Look Like Jessica Simpson," Jessica has incredibly clear and healthy looking skin. Her secret? Proactiv! You've probably seen Jess appearing on all the Proactiv infomercials, complimenting the product and telling people how much it helped her clear up her acne. However, if you don't like Proactiv or want to save money, don't fret. Try a range of good quality affordable products, and select what works for you. Buy a cleanser and moisturizer. That is really all you need. You can buy other products if you like, such as acne cream or face toner, but those are not essential. Make sure you drink lots of water to keep your skin looking clean and fresh. Eat a diet rich in vitamins and minerals-including: nuts, fruits, vegetables, and oils. If you suffer from acne, try seeking the advise of your doctor or a Dermatologist. Make sure you always clean off makeup at the end of the day. Also, consider providing yourself a facial routine and be sure to wash your face at least twice a day!;
, You must have noticed that Jess has a Hollywood smile-her teeth are perfectly straight, pearly white and healthy. This is an essential if you want to look like Jess. Brush at least twice a day. Your tooth enamel is relatively thin, so if you scrub too hard, it will eventually wear away, leaving your teeth sensitive. Brush gently but thoroughly. Flossing helps remove plaque that your brush can't reach. Dairy products (unless you are allergic to dairy products or are one a dairy restrictive diet) can help you have strong, healthy teeth.

, Jess has changed her hair quite a bit, so there are a few styles to choose from. You can go blonde, with wavy, long, locks or a straight, medium length look. You can also try her brunette look and keep it long and wavy. Jess's hair always looks healthy and shiny, so make sure yours looks the same. Jess also wears her hair down a lot.

, Jess obviously likes her eyeliner. Make sure your eyes are always lined in black. Keep your lips glossed, and when wearing lipstick, find a red that suits you. Get a good skin concealer and foundation, and a natural-looking blush. Choose shades that match your skin.

, Fun dresses and skirts are good if you want to look like Jess-as well as jeans and t-shirts. Colors like white, yellow, some black, blue denim, purple and occasionally some forest greens and reds are good. You don't have to get expensive designer clothing-just pick stuff that you feel good in that Jess might wear. When dressing up, stick to a 2-3 colours that work well together. Keep jewelry simple and pretty. Silver Hoops and other dangly earrings, and delicate necklaces.

Buy and apply false eyelashes, by applying a strip of glue along the line of an individual eyelash 'piece'.,

Lips: A pale rosy-plum colour is vital.,
To achieve Miko's bombshell-blonde hair in this video, there are THREE options.","How to Look Like Izabella Miko in the Killers' ""Mr. Brightside"" Music Video"," A pale base is a good starter, so use either rice powder, talcum powder, or another chalky white, dry powdered substance like translucent finishing powder (matter,not shimmery) to get the Bella Swan-like base you do so desire.;
, Perfectly arched brow's make a face! Make them bolder by,after plucking them, highlighting them with a brown eyebrow pencil,and smoothing them out. Brush with an eyebrow comb, them spray with hairspray to dry and hold in place.

, So sculpt the face, brush a small amount of a rosy blush onto a special blush brush, and brush in an upwards motion on your cheek bones. (HINT: If you smile, the apples of your cheeks will be easier to locate- that is where you brush.)

, Instructions should be in the box that contains the lashes, but as an alternative, try different types of thickening or sculpting mascara's instead (try brown-blacks and ebonies for shade variations to see which one suits you the best.)

, If you have blue or green eyes, try brown, for brown eyes - black is best, though lucky brown-eyed girls can work both. Brush a small amount of charcoal grey or smokey brown eyeshadow with either a small eyeshadow applicator or a finger.

, Avoid lipstain, a natural looking 'rosewood' lipstain, or 'blushed plum' eyeshadow (This does work!) applied to lips, with a thin layer of Vaseline coated over, is the best way to go. Don't apply to much gloss otherwise you might kill the look.

HAIR OPTION 1#- Get Wiggy! Fake it with a Rapunzel blonde wig that can be bought for $6 to $60. Curl the hair with a curling wand to achieve the 'wavy' a affect, or use a 'crimping iron' for a fuzzier look.
HAIR OPTION 2#- Hair already identical to Miko's? Just crimp, (not til crisp!), then use a manual or heat-powered curling wand to create the fuzzy, doll-like look the video's stylist has created before you.
HAIR OPTION 3#- Looking to switch from Halloween outfit, to daily look? Go to a hairdresser or a salon! Look around for tips, and definitely go to a hairdresser to have your hair bleached for the first time! If you have virgin hair (hasn't been bleached or dyed, or damaged chemically), then keep in mind; this is going to cause a fair bit of damage! If you're naturally Delta-blonde, try using plain dye, If you can't afford a hairdresser, or are stubborn about a DIY job- You'll need a box of bleach (FIRST level if natural hair, if very dark or previously dyed dark, but extreme or L++.), a blonde dye two shades later then what the bleach will colour you- various tools, and patience. You'll go through coppery-ginger-orange stages, until you reach your final colour, so don't panic! Seek professional consultation before dying your hair, and research various dying or alternative methods!

Nor do you have to copy her signature length: your hair can be as short as a pixie cut or as long as a shoulder-length bob. The key to channeling Jett’s spunky hairstyle is texture.


Ask your stylist to make your ‘do as choppy as possible. Bring a photo of Jett to ensure your stylist gets the picture. Your stylist will razor shear your hair to get that jagged look while also cutting out some bangs.;
, With the right razor-sheared haircut, your daily styling routine shouldn’t be too intense, but there are a few instruments and products you will want to have on hand.


Even if your hair is naturally straight, you’ll want to use a straightener to accentuate your jagged locks and make the look more dramatic.
Get creative with gels, hair waxes, and non-sticky hair sprays to make your spiky look more durable., If you want to try out Jett’s signature black, try a demi-permanent home or salon treatment first. This way you can make sure the change isn’t too startling for your daily life.


If you want to stay away from dark dyes, consider dying a streak or several streaks of your hair bright colors. This kind of half-measure adds a healthy dollop of punk to your look without forcing you to commit to a complete color overhaul.
When going for a bright color, get your hair professionally bleached before applying the colored dye. In-home bleaching is possible, but you’ll get the best and safest results from a professional colorist., Be bold: don't be afraid of a heavily-smudged, dark eye. It's part of Jett's signature gritty aesthetic and will complement the rest of your ensemble.


Start with a primer, which can help keep your makeup from smearing or settling into wrinkles. Then apply concealer to your eyelid and under-eye so you begin with a neutral, smooth canvas and eliminate dark circles.Apply a dark eyeshadow to your eyelid from lash-line up to the crease. Be sure to blow on the brush first to remove any excess shadow. Using a small, angled brush, apply the shadow to your lower lash-line.Blend and smudge the edges of the shadow. You can use a cotton swab or a brush for this job. Remember that a smoky eye should not have any sharp lines.
Tight-line your upper eyelid with eyeliner. This means the eyeliner is so tight against your lashes that there is no skin visible between line and lash.Then add a medium-shade eyeshadow on top of the dark shadow and blend upward toward the crease. The color should be dark by your lashes and taper in intensity as you move up toward the crease, until it is almost sheer. Make sure you blend and buff out any harsh lines.Don't forget to curl your lashes and apply mascara to complete the look.

, You don't want want your facial makeup to compete with your bold eyes, so keep this part of your look softer. Brushing on some bronzer or light blush should be enough to highlight your cheekbones while still allowing your dramatic eyes to take the spotlight.


Don’t be afraid of rocking pale skin! While a healthy tan has been in vogue for a couple of decades, Jett’s look is unapologetically fair. Embracing your pale persona will offset the dramatic colors and texture of your hair, as well as the dark and metallic tones of your ensemble.

, If you take the time to browse photo galleries of Jett's storied career, you'll find that Jett's smoldering eye was almost always paired with a matte nude lip.While the nude lip is Jett’s customary look, feel free to experiment with darker crimsons and browns. Jett’s early career placed her just as firmly in the glam-rock scene as it did in the punk-rock one, and she has frequently identified the famously lipstick-loving David Bowie as her personal style icon.Try a matte liquid lipstick for maximum stain and minimal upkeep.

, As Jett’s career has spanned several decades, she has rocked all colors, kinds, and cuts of denim over the years. Be them boot cut, flared, skinny, or straight leg, any cut of jeans can channel Joan Jett’s tough, retro style.The key to making any pair work is fit and color.


As a general rule, opt for darker washes of blue, slate gray, or black denim. Lighter washes can work if you’re going for an old-school Ramones vibe, but make sure they’re obviously stone-washed or bleached or otherwise vintage.No matter what cut of jeans you select, go for a slim fitting leg. Skinny jeans and slim straight legs look great with Jett’s signature sneakers, but boot cuts and flares can also look long and sleek if they’re fitted properly.
Get creative. Distressed or cuffed details on your denim can add visual interest and edge to your Jett-inspired outfit. If your jeans feel a little bare or simple, consider spiffing them up with a few safety pins, metal studs, or a DIY bleach job.

, Joan’s style is famously androgynous, so the key to mimicking her look is balancing feminine articles with masculine ones.For your bottom layer, pick out a black tank top or white wife-beater that goes with anything. If you’re fresh out of these undergarment staples, a lacy camisole or ripped-up band T-shirt will serve just as well.
Pop a leather motorcycle jacket, destructed sweater, or masculine blazer over your bottom layer. Dark colors should dominate your outfit, but inject flashes of color—particularly reds, oranges, and pinks—to amp up the attitude., While Jett was known to rock a heel from time to time, her signature look has to be the Chucks.Though Chucks come in all hues and prints, opt for a darker shade to complement your dark denim.
If you’re not in the mood for sneakers, a pair of combat or motorcycle boots will always work. For a cheaper alternative to real leather, pick up a pair of vegan leather booties or ankle boots.
If you’re going for Joan’s glam-rock, concert-ready look, some retro glitter wedges or platform-heeled ankle boots will pair perfectly with your bell-bottomed jump suit or other over-the-top ensemble.

, Jett’s style depends heavily on her jewelry and supplemental sartorial details. Anything chunky and metallic is a must, and you can’t go wrong with leather or pleather accents.


When selecting your neckwear, choose a black leather or suede choker. Alternatively, you could slip on a heavy chain or dog tag necklace.
More is more when it comes to bracelets. Chunky studded leather cuffs or gobs of bangles (or both!) will always go splendidly with your Jett-inspired outfit.

, Jett’s black belt has become part of rock ‘n’ roll lore, as she famously gave her favorite Runaways belt to Sid Vicious who, in turn, wore the belt until his early demise.So don’t forget this essential cog in Jett’s machine when assembling your outfit for the day.


The classic two- or three-tiered studded belt is a Jett-essential, as well as belts with two or three rows of metal grommets.

, Find a wide pin selection by browsing band merchandise online or through retailers like Hot Topic.

While chest muscles won't enlarge your breasts, they can make them look larger. Therefore, focusing part of your exercises on your chest can help you work towards an hourglass figure.One simple way to work on your chest muscles is to do push-ups. Lay face down on the floor, with the balls of your feet touching the floor. Lift yourself off the floor with arms, keeping your body straight. You don't need to go down all the way to the floor, but you should at least go down until your elbows form a 90-degree angle.You can also try dumbbell flys. On your back, hold a dumbbell in each hand. Bend your arms so your hand meet above your chest. Keeping your arms bent, bring the dumbbells outward, until you eventually straighten each arm all the way out, like you're going to give someone a hug. Bring your arms back to your chest. Try repetitions of six or eight with rests in between.;
,

Part of the hourglass figure is a trim waist. To have a trim waist, you need to lose weight overall, as focusing just on your waist is not possible.Do aerobic exercises such as biking, swimming, or running. Try to get in about 30 minutes a day.Eat well. Focus on fruits, veggies, whole grains, and low-fat protein, such as fish and poultry. Try to skip foods with processed sugar and trans fat. Stick to healthy fats such as avocado, nuts, and fish.Pick up good habits, such as getting enough sleep. Also, don't smoke. Improving your habits makes you healthier overall and helps you lose weight.,

To get a toned rear, you need to focus exercises in this area. Try doing squats and lunges to help build muscle. In addition, try to pick aerobic exercise that will build muscle in this area, such as running.,

Before putting on makeup, take some time to gently massage your face. The purpose is to get your blood pumping to your face, as well as to reduce any swelling or puffiness.Try applying a massage cream first to help with the massage.When rubbing, rub from the center of your forehead outward in circular motions. Similarly, when you rub the skin near your eyes, rub from the bridge of your nose outward, both above and below.Go down your nose and rub your nostrils in an up and down motion. Move outward from the center of your face around your lips. Move in circular motions up your cheeks. Finally, using your whole hand, move from the center of your face out to your ears. You can wipe any excess cream off at the end.,

If you're using a liquid foundation, it's important to warm it up in your hand first. That way, it won't sit on top of your skin. Rather, it will be more readily absorbed into your skin, helping it glow.,

Powder can keep you from looking shiny. However, stick to the forehead, nose, chin, and sides of your face, skipping the eyes and cheeks. That way, you won't look shiny, but you will glow in all the right places.,

Lopez often has very dramatic eye makeup. The makeup makes her eyes pop, pulling the focus there.For instance, try applying a gray eye shadow to your eyelids. Use a black or dark eye liner on both your upper and lower lids. Finally, add two coats of black mascara.If you want to go even more dramatic, try a trick that Lopez's stylists use. They often add fake eyelashes to enhance her eyes.,

That is, pick a nude or light color for your lips. Lopez often has a nude lip to help her look flawless. Pick a color in your skin tone, though it can have a hint of pink or shimmer.,

Lopez often sports a high ponytail for an easy every day look or even a look for a night on the town. She keeps it tightly pulled back, but often lets it loose in the back with messy curls or waves.,

Lopez often sticks to just wearing earrings, but they usually make a statement. Sometimes, she chooses larger-than-life hoops, but she also sports smaller versions that are elegant and classy.,

Lopez favors skin-tight dresses. Often times, they have cutouts that are a bit revealing. She's not afraid to show off her body. In fact, she often has dresses that have cutouts along the sides.,

Lopez sometimes sports dresses that use lace as a way to reveal some skin. Other dresses she chooses use other sheer fabrics in much the same way, strategically placing opaque fabric or even sequences over parts of her body.,

Lopez radiates wherever she goes. You may be tempted to try a tanning bed or stay outside to tan, but a safer bet is a spray tan or lotion. Don't forget to put on gloves before you apply it, though, as it will stick to the palms of your hand and your fingertips.,

Don't pick one that's too dark for your skin tone. If you want to go darker, just apply the tanner more than once. In addition, skip the sprays. Creams, lotions, and mousses are much easier to use and make for better results.,

By getting off the dead skin first, you'll end up with a more even tan.It's also important to moisturize for the same reason. Apply a light moisturizer before you apply the tan.,

In addition, add a bit to your hairline. This precaution will help keep the tanner out of these areas.,

Go with your arms, legs, torso, and back first. Next move on to your knees, feet, ankles, and neck. You can buff out any place that's too dark with a towel.,

After you apply tanner, put something you don't mind staining, as tanner can stain. In addition, pick something loose, that won't stick too closely too your skin will the tanner absorbs."

Don't be afraid to be a little funky.",How to Look Like Cheryl Cole," Cheryl is known for her very slim figure.To help you on your way to slimming down, start by eating right. That is, move your diet to more healthy foods over time, and reduce your overall caloric intake.Fill your diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables. Choose whole grains over more processed grains. Try lean proteins and low-fat dairy.
In addition, pick healthy fats, such as avocado, nuts, and salmon over less healthy fats, like the ones found in fried foods or red meat.In particular, Cheryl loves foods such as nuts, blueberries, and avocados.;
, Simple sugar, like that found in soda, juice, or sweets, just adds empty calories to your diet, making it more difficult for you to lose weight. Plus, you're leaving out the fiber of fruit, which helps keep you full. Drink water instead of soda, and pick a piece of fruit for dessert., Not only will sleep help you look better overall, sleep is essential for losing weight, as well. Make sure you are getting in your recommended 8 hours of sleep each night.If you're having trouble going to bed on time, trying setting an alarm an hour before you need to go to sleep. That way, you have an auditory clue to tell you it's time to go to bed. Shut off any electronics, and start getting ready for bed.

, To keep yourself in shape, you need regular bouts of aerobic exercise. At a minimum, you need at least 70 minutes of aerobic activity a week if it's vigorous or 150 minutes if it's moderate. However, to get Cheryl's body, you're probably going to need to put in some extra hours.You should also strength train at least twice a week. Strength-training exercises include things like lifting weights, doing sit-ups, and doing push-ups.
Aerobic exercises include swimming, running, biking, or playing a sport.

, Hydration keeps you healthier overall. Plus, Cheryl swears by it and always has water on hand. In addition, it can keep you looking younger by increasing your skin hydration., That is, when you're young, you've already got great skin. Cheryl recommends a tinted moisturizer rather than a heavy foundation, especially when you're younger., Cheryl sometimes creates a smokiness around her eyes for a dramatic effect. Mostly, this look involves making the underside of your eye darker.Line the underside of your eyes with a dark color (but not black), bringing it out about a half an inch past the eye on the outside, tipping it slightly up as you go. Use a eyeliner brush to help pull the color into a thicker line. Basically, you're making a sharp-pointed cat-eye.Also come back on top with the color, but just a little about a third of way along the top, following your eyelid.Add in some smokey eye shadow under your eye, making the line thicker once again. Finally, come with a much darker eye shadow, just along the bottom edge of your eye and out into the point.Add in some gold eye shadow on the top of your eye, starting in the inner corner and working outward to the dark part of your eye. Line the upper eye in a dark eye liner. Don't forget the mascara at the end., Shape your eyebrows with an eyebrow pencil. Sometimes, Cheryl goes for a more straightened-out eyebrow,while other times, she prefers a dramatic curve.The choice is up to you, but once you've plucked your eyebrows of any stray hairs, use a brow pencil that matches your hair color to create the shape you want and make your eyebrows more dramatic., During the day, stick with a nude color that matches your skin tone. At night, go for something more colorful and dramatic, such as a bright red.To test a color, rub it on the back of your hand to see how it looks.

, Create a more dramatic look by adding slightly darker contouring makeup to your look. Brush it just under your cheekbones, sloping upward towards the back of your face to help your cheeks pop like Cheryl's., While Cheryl loves makeup, she also enjoys keeping it simple sometimes, especially when she's just hanging out around the house or on a vacation. She does make sure to wash her face thoroughly to remove all the makeup from the day before, though., Cheryl recommends always taking your makeup off before you go to bed. She says it helps to keep your pores clear and keeps your skin looking younger.Pick a cleanser that's right for your skin type. Most cleansers are made for different skin types, such as dry, medium, or oily. Look on the bottle for one that's right for you.
It's also a good idea to wash your face each morning, too.

, After washing it before bed, Cheryl also believes it's important to moisturize. Stick with a facial moisturizer built for your skin. Like cleanser, they range in type from oily to dry., Cheryl is a firm believer in using sunscreen. She sticks with a 30 SPF when she's going to be out in the sun. It helps protect her skin, while still letting her get a nice glow., Cheryl swears by creating a thick cloud of perfume. She goes by one rule: pump your perfume 25 times as you put it on. She lets it gently envelope her whole body, not just her wrists or neck., For deep moisturizing, Cheryl enjoys using oil-based lotions. She slathers them on before sleeping so her skin is moisturized overnight. Be sure to concentrate on dry areas, such as knees, elbows, heels, and hands., Though Cheryl has talked about going super-short with her hair (AKA a pixie cut), she prefers to keep it at least shoulder length. At that length, she can do a number of different styles, from up-dos to braids.About the shortest Cheryl has worn her hair is a bob cut., One thing Cheryl loves about longer hair is that it is easy. She loves to pull it up into a top knot and go., One of Cheryl's favorite tricks is to let a top knot do the work overnight. After washing her hair, she dries it upside-down. Then she uses a warming brush to pull it into the top knot. In the morning, she pulls it down and has wavy hair., Over the years, Cheryl has tried a number of different styles and colors. Of course, she's always going for that perfect look, but she's not afraid to try different things in the pursuit of it., Hair masks help rejuvenate your hair, keeping it from becoming damaged over time. Cheryl prefers to do hair masks at least twice a week. She claims if she doesn't, her hair looks much worse.You can make a simple hair mask at home, probably from ingredients you already have. Mix 1 part coconut oil with 1 part honey (raw, if you have it). You'll likely only need about a tablespoon of each. You can substitute another oil, such as olive oil, if that's all you have.Heat the ingredients quickly on the stove or in the microwave, being careful not to burn them. Make sure the mixture isn't too hot for your skin.Wet your hair first. Rub the mixture into your hair in sections, starting from the top. Make sure you get the tips, as they usually have the most damage. When you've applied it all over your head, scoop your hair up in a bun, and let it sit for about half an hour before washing it out., Cheryl loves high fashion. She isn't afraid to wear a couture gown to hit the red carpet. For instance, one dress she wore in 2015 was a floor-length, full-skirt dress that moved from dramatic red on the top to black on the bottom., While Cheryl can rock a big, fancy dress, she also doesn't mind picking something a little plainer. For instance, sometimes she wears slinky floor-length dresses in a single color.Nonetheless, she isn't afraid to pick something that shows some skin, including long slits up from the floor.

, Cheryl also goes a little old-fashioned sometimes, with a puffy mini-dress or a dress made of lace.She's also not afraid to wear a throw-back pattern or hairdo (like a beehive)., Cheryl likes fancy gowns, but she also doesn't mind a more rock-'n'-roll look. For example, at a one event, she wore a t-shirt, long black coat, black leather skinny pants, and a fringed leather purse, topped off with a pair of leather boots."

She also once paired leather shorts with a cropped floral top. , A common Ellie casual style is to pair a fitted jacket with slim, tight-fitting black pants (either leather or jeans) and a T-shirt.

Get the Ellie personality.,
Exercise.,
Go vintage and don't think expensive.",How to Look Like Ellie Goulding2," Part of a person's look is the aura they give off. Ellie is more likely to be seen with a book than a beer. She has called herself a ""shy geek.""She cites Laurent Binet and Eckhart Tolle as her favorite authors.
She has been described as mixing ""awkwardness and disco glamour."" So don't try to look too slick or always on or you won't master her vibe.

"
Study Ellie's hair.,
Use makeup correctly.",How to Look Like Ellie Goulding3," Ellie's hair is one of her signatures. It's a golden, light blonde, almost platinum. To look like her, though, you have to master the style, not just the color. Her hair is thick, so you might need to tease yours by backcombing it.


Ellie's hair has been called the ""magical cool girl without trying look."" It's not overly done. It's more accurately described as a little wind blown and tousled. Most people think of her hair as being worn in a long, slightly wavy style, with her bangs medium length and worn pushed to the side. Her hair has been described as having ""beachy"" waves. To get them, towel dry wet hair. Add mousse to the hair. Then, blow dry it. Finally, take two-inch sections of hair, roll them around your finger, and then use a bobby pin to fasten them at the roots. Let hair set for a short time, and then remove the bobby pins. You should have Ellie's loose waves.
You could use a styling wand instead of bobby pins to create the same look. Use a wide toothed comb, not a brush, or you will ruin the waves. However, she's also experimented with cutting her hair into a shoulder length bob that is parted in the middle. Still, it always looks a little tousled. To get this look, use a volumizer spray in your hair or put a few curls in it, but make sure it doesn't look overly done.
Ellie experiments with braids. Sometimes she plaits her hair into a long, thick braid that she wears to one side (and you might see her wearing a black baseball cap backwards on it besides). And sometimes she braids a small piece of her bangs near her face, leaving the rest of her hair long and flowing. Use a bobby pin to fasten the braid to the rest of the hair for a classic Ellie Goulding look. Ellie plays with color. She once put a light pink streak in her blonde hair. If you wanted to try this as a temporary look, you could try pink hair chalk. She takes chances with her hair. Once, Ellie shaved part of the side of her hair, leaving the rest of her hair her signature tousled and long look. , Ellie is not known for looking very obviously made up. Her look is more natural, and she is known for using ""soft rosy hues"" like peach or pink or neutrals on her lips and eyes. She focuses on the eyes for effect, and makes sure her skin is glowing. . Her ads for MAC makeup have been described as having a 1970s vibe.


Use black liquid eyeliner to create a cat eye look. To create a cat eye, line the top of the lid only, going slightly past the end of the eye. Don't put liner on the bottom of the eye. If you prefer, you could line the lids with soft brown eyeliner instead. A lighter peach blush dusted over the cheekbones is more Ellie's style than something harsher or darker. The goal of Ellie's makeup line is to make a person look better without it being obvious they are wearing a lot of makeup. A little mascara livens up the eyes. False eyelashes can place the focus on the eyes all the more. In fact, one of her makeup secrets is to apply false eyelashes on the top lid. You want fake eyelashes that are longer on the outside corner. Put volumizing mascara on your own lashes. Cut the fake eyelashes so the outer third of them matches the outer third of your eye. Put a drop of eyelash glue on the fake lashes and then fasten them to the top of your eyelids with tweezers. Hold in place for several seconds, and then curl with an eyelash curler.
Her eyeshadow is usually in neutral and natural colors, like brown and beige.
Ellie likes to play with makeup on her eyes, but she often uses nude gloss or gold shimmering lipstick. Every now and then, she will dab a light peach color on her lips, but you're unlikely to see her with dark or obvious lipstick. She has said she is a fan of lipsticks in various shades of pink. "

Get a haircut.,
Dye your hair (unless your natural hair is Dougie's color).,
Take care of your hair everyday.,
Buy ""skater"" clothes.,
Get a tattoo.,
Pierce your nose.,
Learn to love lizards!,
Start a musical instrument.,
Listen to Dougie's favorite bands.,
Be a fan of Tom Delonge.",How to Look Like Dougie Poynter," If you want to look like Dougie, you should definitely change. Don't forget, Dougie's style is the most different from the other band members. And the most important? His appearance changes are his own decisions. That means, he trusts much more himself than a simple stylist. At the pictures to the right, you can see the progress and the changes of Dougie's haircuts through the years. You can choose whichever haircut you like the most, but the later ones are much more Dougie.;
, Dougie's natural color is light brown/blond but he has made a few changes throughout his career. His main color has been blond, but he has also experimented himself with purple or brown highlights.

, Shower and after that use conditioner for your hair. This will make the every-day-hair-preparation much more easier. Apart from the last haircut of Dougie, the other ones require straight hair.

, Dougie is 23 years old but it could be said that he represents the ages of 16 until 18 years old. He loves hats, and skate/surf brand clothing. Specifically:



Buy brand clothes. It sounds expensive but skating brand clothes are the main characteristic of Dougie's style. Try out Hurley, Atticus, Wesc, Billabong, Fallen, Volcom, Adio, Etnies, Macbeth e.t.c.

Buy hats. The branded hats aren't necessary but they surely add more glamour to the whole style. You could try the same brands with the T-shirts.


Wear knee breeches. Dougie loves them and everyone can see that from his appearances. Occasionally, you should show up with some jeans but this isn't necessary. Since many jeans aren't part of the ""skater"" style, you will have to work at finding the appropriate attire. Try baggier pants for the correct look.
Buy branded shoes. The favorite brands of Dougie in shoes are Adio Nixon, Macbeth and Etnies however he claimed to have a large collection of Puma trainers when the band started. His newest shoes are bright blue and red hi-top Adidas. You could experiment yourself though.

, Dougie has four tattoos - a star on each ankle (one blue, one red), the word ""Athletes"" across the top of his foot, and a large space-themed scene - complete with rocket and lizard-skull - over his upper right chest. In the summer of 2006 he had the tattoo extended down his right arm, he has a chameleon in a spaceship eating a tie fighter from Star Wars and it's in a nebular. Doing the exactly same tattoos would be considered as imitation. In late 2010 he had the tattoo extended down his arm. It is completely covered with meteors, and ships. Going down he as microphones, a totem pole, a giant stone statue and leaves around his arm. So improvise and think something who has to do with these designs.

, It was known that Dougie had a lip piercing though he doesn't have it anymore as it got infected but girls adored it. There have been many fan pages about that lip ring. You should give a try, but don't do it on your own. Let an expert do it for you. He also had his nose pierced around the summer of 2008 until around the end of 2008. He claimed it also got infected in 2009 so he removed it. If a nose piercing isn't really your style, try a couple of the piercings below to add an instant rocker vibe to your look although the lip-ring would be the recommended option.


For example:

Bridge: Very top of nose, between the eyes.
Eyebrow: Pierced on the outer half of the eyebrow, vertically. (Harry from McFLY has this piercing)
Labret: Middle of lower lip.
Septum: Bottom middle of nose, below where the cartilage ends.
Nostril: Side of the nose. (Dougie has been spotted with Nostril but since most don't know it, you can try it).



, Dougie's nickname at school was ""Lizard King"" so you should at least like them. Dougie had once said in an interview that if he wasn't a bassist, he would have been herpetologist.





House a lizard and take care of it as a simple pet. Get some photos with your lizard so that you show off that you have it as a pet.
Make a scrapbook or a folder in your computer full of lizards in case your parents don't let you to buy one. Carry it with you often.



, The best would be to play bass but if you don't want to, you could try to play guitar. Dougie's weakness is his bass. He's been playing bass for years (since he was 13) so the earlier you start the better.

, Dougie is the bassist in McFLY which is more of a pop band but as he never forgets to claim he loves pop-punk music Specifically, he enjoys listening to bands like:


Blink-182
Sum 41
New Found Glory
My Chemical Romance
Angels & Airwaves
Wet Wet Wet
The All-American Rejects
Green Day
Brand New
Less Than Jake
Pennywise
Nirvana

, Tom Delonge is a member of the band Blink-182 who Dougie once interviewed. Dougie considers Tom as his idol and his room is still full of his posters. So collect posters of Blink 182, buy their albums from CD shops or online and add some of their songs in your MP3 player to show your preferences.

Make sure you are either laughing or crying often.",How to Act Like Maya Hart from Girl Meets World," She's very witty and clever. She's always loyal to Riley, her best friend, and she's always willing to fight for what she believes in. She can be daring and rebellious. Sometimes she goes a little too far - but it's better, she thinks, to go too far than not to go far enough. She also is a little careless, or acts this way, and is always cool and calm. Understanding Maya's mindset, what drives her to act the way she does, will help you be able to act more like her. Watch the show as much as possible to figure her out.;
, Maya will always go for what she wants, right away. She's very confident and outgoing, and when she decides she wants to do something, she makes it happen. If you want to be like her, adopt a similar ""just do it!"" attitude. Don't hesitate before you act - when you know something's right, just go for it.

, Maya loves to draw and has incredible artistic talent - in the second episode, she drew an amazing rendition of the city. Spend a lot of time sketching, and practice drawing until you get good.

, Her style is funky and fresh. She loves to mix together different clothing, colors, and styles, and she always accessorizes with a huge variety of things, from scarves to necklaces. She also always has a nice jacket or blazer to make any look more sophisticated. You don't need to wear exactly what Maya wears, but adopt her attitude towards fashion: create your own style that fits your unique personality, just like she did.

, Loosely curl your hair to get her big, curly waves. Wear a little foundation and bronzer, a tiny bit of eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara to bring out your eyes, and a little colored lip gloss. You should look good, but don't overdo it - keep it natural and make sure you look like yourself.

, Maya doesn't care about the negative people around her. Regardless of what others say or do, she stays true to herself. She sticks up for herself in so many ways, and she never gives up on who she is or what she believes in. You should do the same: love who you are and fight for it, no matter what anyone else says or thinks.

, Above all, Maya is always loyal to her best friend, Riley. She's always there to support her, comfort her, and give her good advice about life, boys, or anything else. Be just as loyal to your own best friend or friends. Always love and support your friends, and make sure to stay loyal to them.

, Maya is cool as a cucumber, but her emotional stability is a laugh.

Don't forget to drink coffee.",How to Act Like Mordecai from Regular Show," Act fragile, be yourself, and be carefree. Remember this step. Know how to liven up boring moments. Always treat others the way you want to be treated. If something is upsetting you, always handle it in the calmest way possible. Be kind to everyone, even if they are mean to you. Don't yell, and don't ever make it seem like you can break. Always be kind, and it might even drive the mean people insane.;
, You need to organize your schedule, and not multitask very much. Don't ever try to rush anything, don't be a perfectionist, and don't fall apart. You need to act like you don't have a weak spot, even though you do. Being Mordecai is of course, being laid back. You can't worry all the time. If something bad happens, step back, look at the situation, and find the best solution.

, If you have a gaming system such as a PS3, Xbox, or Wii, use it more often and try to be a gamer. Also, if there's an opportunity where you can sing karaoke for fun, go to town. Part of being like Mordecai is drinking a lot of coffee and soda. Even though it's bad for your health, try to drink either of those two whenever given the opportunity. Never get addicted and drink these all the time, but if you are at a restaurant or the like, you should order coffee or soda.

, Don't try to rush anything, and don't yell for people who told you to hold on. Try to always have something on you to keep you busy such as a 3DS, PSP, or iPhone. Try not to get frustrated by puzzles or assignments, and if you are, just take a 20 minute break. Write down in a journal whatever makes you impatient, and try to work on it. Use coping strategies such as deep breathing, counting to 10, or simply just watching a cartoon. Act like you have all the time in the world, even if you don't.

, Keep every promise you make. Do all your homework and study, because part of being responsible is having good grades. If you fail a promise or assignment, take the blame, and do NOT make excuses. Don't try to be perfect, and admit to your mistakes without blaming others. Don't take your anger out on people either. Keep any complaints to yourself, and if you need to get them out, write them in the journal from the last step.

, Mordecai is intelligent, and you can also be intelligent in many different ways. Try to learn new words and spend some time with a dictionary. Try to maybe teach yourself a new language, or take a class for it. Keep up with the news, and go online to read about recent events in your city.

, Don't judge people, unless they ask you to or that's what you're supposed to do in said situation. Mordecai is a character who goes with the flow, and doesn't over think anything. Be selfless, and put other peoples needs before your own. Try to be more outgoing. Don't be afraid to strike up conversations with friendly people whether its at the ice cream parlor, the movies, or the park. View the glass as half full. We are all going to be faced with negative scenarios in our lives, but no matter what the scenario is, try to find out something positive about it. In conversations, always listen, don't interrupt, and don't talk about yourself too much. If you're at a public event, turn off your phone and socialize.

, Wear what you want, and not what other people want. But whatever you do, make sure your clothes are modest, comfortable, and clean. Take care of your clothes, even if you have no interest in them. Make sure you always dress decent, and never forget to take care of yourself. You never know what day you will run into the girl/guy of your dreams. Of course, most girls/guys would rather date someone who cares about their appearance.

, Don't try to be JUST Mordecai. Add in whatever your personality is to the mix whether it's funny, shy, or a sports lover. You are allowed to skip any of these steps, because after all this is only meant to be inspiration. But whatever you do, DON'T skip this one. Don't be afraid to let loose and be crazy sometimes. Mordecai is fun too.

, Shower every day. Wash your face every morning. Brush your teeth twice a day. Wear some deodorant. Wash your clothes too.

, You don't have to comb it for hours on end, just give some time to comb it every day. Try to keep it neat, and make it look like you care about your hair. In other words, don't make it look like you just got out of bed.

, Mordecai sometimes demonstrates his leadership skills, and you should too. Spend some of your time helping others, whether it be organizing a fundraiser, helping a friend write a song, or even something as simple as helping a younger sibling with their science homework. Mordecai knows how to be in charge, and it is definitely a good skill to have. If you have a computer, you should try playing the Sims, where you control a bunch of peoples lives at once. If you have a 3DS, you should try playing Animal Crossing: New Leaf, where you have to be the mayor of a town.

, Use a system such as a PS3, Xbox, or Wii. Try games like action games, (Minecraft, Call of Duty, Legend of Zelda) adventure games, (Resident Evil, Banjo-Kazooie, Super Mario Bros) or RPGs (Final Fantasy, Skylanders, Paper Mario) Whatever you do, do NOT stick to one genre. Experiment with the tons of different genres out there, no matter what the game is.

, Everybody knows that Mordecai is smarter than Rigby. If you're in middle or high school, keep in mind that there are some amazing colleges out there, but they only take people with the best grades. Set good goals for each subject, do all your homework, study, and work your way towards honor roll. Once you get onto honor roll, you could either strive to stay on honor roll, or work your way up to high honors. Keep in mind every subject counts whether it's science, art, history, math, or really any subject even as seemingly unimportant as phys ed.

, Mordecai is improving at guitar, and maybe you can learn as well. Whether you have an acoustic guitar or an electric guitar, teach yourself how to play it well. Buy yourself a guitar pick in your favorite color. Learn a variety of songs, because you never know when you'll have to strum for your life. If you really want to take it to the next level, look for some guitar lessons. Make sure to get a quality instructor, and make your budget as cheap or expensive as you desire. Even if you get lessons, make sure to practice at home every day too. Set aside at least 20 minutes a day, to go over some of your songs. Believe it or not, if you stay away from the guitar for too long, you will forget all of the pieces you've learned.

, Mordecai doesn't seem to have a preferred amount of sugar or cream, so use whatever amount you please. Just don't drink it after 7pm.

Try to get first edition comics, keep them in mint condition. Be sure to boast about them.;
, Study up on String Theory, and other physics theories; be able to explain these to anyone who asks and defend your own theories. Stack your shelves with scientific books (and read them too). Constantly watch documentaries on any science subjects.

, Get a few other nerd friends and form a group. You can have a Wii bowling league, and a band on Rock Band. Try to get in a routine and have nights for each activity. For instance, Thursday night - Halo Night, and Friday night - Wii Tennis Night. Try to get as many game consoles as possible.

, You could even learn sci-fi languages, such as Klingon.

,, Act like you don't understand sarcasm. Don't use sarcasm either.


Say 'Bazinga' when you have told a practical joke. Don't play practical jokes too much though.

, Also, make a spreadsheet showing your routine, so that other people are aware of it. Put it up where people will see it.

, You can do this alphabetically, by colour, or size. Make sure you and other people put everything back in exactly the same place. Have your cereals stacked according to fiber content.

, Buses carry diseases, as do trains and airplanes. But Sheldon is obsessed with trains. Just don't drive a car and have someone drive you if you can't find a train.

, Repetition is how Sheldon thrives. He has a Thai night, a Chinese night, and so on. Eat takeout with your friends.

, Make up reasons why that seat is perfect and you could not possibly sit anywhere else. Act extremely uncomfortable when forced to sit anywhere else.

, Be awkward in social situations. Never go to parties unless forced to do so.

, If you don't, then look for one.

, Be careful with this though, as you don't want to annoy your partner until the point when they don't want to be with you. Preferably choose a partner who likes The Big Bang Theory too.

, Say the person's name over and over before they answer the door.

, Have takeout food with precise requirements.

Use his words.,

Take time to feel down, too.,
Laugh at yourself.",How to Act Like Michael Scott," Michael Scott is humorous in both the things he says as well as the ways he says them. Some of Michael's go-to phrases include: ""that's what she said,"" ""TMI,"" and ""shut it."" Affirmations he spices up by saying ""abso-fruitly,"" ""yesh,"" and ""yeppers."";
, Michael sees his calling as being a friend first, and an entertainer second. Even when he is in charge of others, his desire to be liked takes priority over his desire to be a good manager.

, Michael does tend to leap deeply into relationships in an unrealistic way. He often sees more than is really there, and this causes him to make grand romantic gestures. Though you don't have to propose to your girlfriend of a few months at a Diwali celebration, we can still learn from Michael's ability to leap without looking (when necessary).

, Michael is a generally clean, well-groomed man. Barring a single-episode goatee in season five, Michael is clean-shaven. He also keeps his hair neat and combed (aside from when he tries to look like Jim).

, Michael wears affordable, one-size-too-big suits in the office. However, he loves to wear jeans outside of work (or on casual Fridays). Don't get too upset if you accidentally wear a blouse, as Michael has accidentally cross dressed before, too.

, Michael's shameless demeanor has its downsides, but no one can say that he doesn't have fun. Michael never takes himself too seriously, and always bounces back from disappointing situations. This emotional resiliency is not something to take lightly, as it can benefit all of us at times.

, Michael is incredibly sensitive, and isn't afraid to mourn the death of his previous boss, and even a random bird. Though you don't have to weep for every dead animal on the side of the road, it is healthy to acknowledge the frustrations and sadness in your life.

, One of Michael's most redeeming qualities is his ability to laugh things off. He doesn't stay in the dumps for long, and understands that keeping things light reduces stress and keeps his peers happy. This is a great lesson to learn when trying to maintain a positive presence in your workplace.

Don't overdo your hair.",How to Act Like River Tam," This is best done after a break. Whether you have one day off or multiple, it's best to come back after an absence from work or school. You could a draw a scar on yourself, act really scared that day, keep yourself hidden from most people, or all of the above! Like something new and terrifying is happening to you. Try to act disturbed.
, River very rarely speaks simply or concisely, usually preferring to speak in a lyrical, almost nursery-rhyme-esque manner. Try not to talk that often and, when you do, don't say things plainly. There are a few exceptions to this (i.e. when River tells Kaylee about her apple, ""It's mine now!""), so you can joke around a little bit. Instead of talking to get people's attention, take things or commit some sort of act. Actions speak louder than words. Don't speak excessively, or more than you need to., River has multiple different gazes that she uses in different situations. You have to master them all as, when you don't talk, you'll find they come in handy quite often.

Puppy Dog Eyes: When you want something, don't beg for it. Ask once, then pout sadly and enlarge your eyes. Glance down and don't look the person you're speaking to in the eye.
Refusal: This is a look mainly used when you don't want to do something. It's a lot like the puppy dog eyes, but a bit more squinted in disgust and sadness. Scrunch up the rest of your face as well.
Happiness: This is a real happy look. If you want to fake being happy, don't do anything with your eyes. Just smile. For this, make sure you let the light reach your eyes when you grin, and don't be afraid to show it off. Use this sparingly, though. Only when you are really, truly joyful. For instance, don't use it when watching a cute video about cats. Use it when two people you love get married.
Death Glare: Use your death glare when someone seriously hurts you or someone you love. Again, use this sparingly. This can be sarcastic, chilling, or terrifying, depending on your personality. Stay calm and speak only with your eyes.
Sadness: This is an easy look to do. Just furrow your brows, squint a little bit, and look down at the ground. If you know how to cry on command, great. Use that in extreme situations.
Loneliness: This is possibly the hardest to do. You need a bit of hopefulness here, with a hint of a smile, but also sadness. Emptiness, terror, and just sheer hopelessness. You really need to embody that outwardly optimistic but inwardly terrified attitude.
Secretive: This is another easy one. Just accompany some happy, sarcastic eyes with a small smirk. If you're sharing this secret with someone, exchange a glance with them.

, Being held in a secret government facility makes even the strongest person paranoid. Always be looking over your shoulder, expecting to see something that's not there. Look for men in blue gloves, security cameras, big white vans, etc. Don't talk to anyone you don't trust and, if you don't know someone on an extremely personal level, keep your guard up around them. Keep your guard up around anyone, but stay remote from anyone you've known for less than a year, or anyone you don't talk to on a daily basis., Some crazy people make slow, subtle movements. River is fast, fleeting, and graceful. Make sure these moves are understated, as you don't want to go over-the-top.

Find an area of your body you've never had to itch. Scratch it an look off and upwards in a random direction, scratching it more intensely, like a flea is biting it. Then, stop suddenly and remain motionless.
Look at random things like you're scared of them, terrified, even. Like they insulted you, said horrible things, or threatened you.
Rub an invisible spot on your pants. Repeat it 100 times. Claim not to know what anyone is talking about when they ask about it.
Twiddle your thumbs, twirl your pen, or tap your fingers in a certain beat. If someone tells you to stop, stop for five to ten minutes before starting up again.
Twitch your eyelids or snap your neck back and forth. Do this sparingly.

, River isn't always insane. Sometimes she can very nice and normal. This is shown in multiple episodes where she's shown eating dinner with everyone else, as well as in a few scenes of Serenity. She and Kaylee are shown to gossip with one another and chase each other around the ship on occasion. She also lets Inara braid her hair and dress her up when she's bored. So, while you should stay silent, don't always be crazy. Let yourself be lucid and yourself for an hour or so. Do whatever it is you want to do for a while., Move, fight, and stand in a balletic style. Walk toe before heel, going from side to side, and make it seem as though you are floating with every step. When you fight, think less like a brute and more like a dancer; swift and fluid, not heavy and strong. Think about walking through clouds with your hands flexed by your sides, flying over cities. Embody this wherever you go., When she's lucid, River is shown to be very sweet and accepting. She helps the mute little girl and the doctors in 'Safe' (although that didn't go well for her), she assists Mal with piloting Serenity when Wash has passed away, and even Mal states that, ""I find River pleasant enough myself."", Be unpredictable. Play with things that you usually wouldn't, have random emotional reactions irrelevant to the situation, make angry gestures to people on the street, or hum abnormal songs to yourself. Try to make an effort to act sane, but just give up. You can't be bothered., Curse at random moments. Make rude gestures to people you know won't react strongly. Threaten people during unplanned times, or just act a bit inappropriate. Not sexually, as River would never do that, but just in your usual 16-year-old girl way.

An example of this could be in 'Safe' when River throws a box of medical supplies at Mal and proceeds to curse at him, laying down on the couch.

, Scream, curse, cry, whatever's necessary. Rant about things that no one understands, experiences that never happened, events that never occurred. Rarely have really intense fits, falling to the ground and covering your head with your hands. Talk about nightmares and wanting them to go away., Spend more time with the people you like, and less with those you don't. Compliment the people you like, and threaten those you don't. Smile at the people you like, glare at those you don't. Finally, simply ignore the people you don't like. But don't threaten them directly. Threaten them with a riddle.

A good example of this is in the episode 'Trash,' when Jayne is stuck on the operating table and River tells him, ""I can kill you with my brain.""

, This can be as many people as you want it to be, but just make sure they'll stick with you. They should be diverse, with all types from everywhere, and their relationships with each other should vary. Even if you favor one over another, make sure that you care for all of them equally., This is a more daring step, but it's necessary if you want to act like River. Intimidate people gently instead of directly. Let's say you're cutting up a sandwich, or just using a sharp object in general. Stop abruptly, look at the object and ask your friends something like, ""Do you care about me?"" or ""Don't leave me alone again."", Read people's faces for their emotions, mirror people, and learn to detect lies. You have to answer questions in riddles so that it seems like you're giving more answers than you really are.

One good thing to do is observe people's eyes. For instance, try playing a certain kind of music on the radio, then play something completely different. Play rock music the whole way home, then switch to pop. If the person in the car glances up at the radio, curious or confused, say something like, ""Yes, it is."" Guess what they're thinking.

, When 'reading' people, never answer what you think they're wondering directly. First of all, this isn't something River would do. Second of all, if you're wrong, you'll just look stupid.

Say you think someone's wondering what 40 + 2 is. Don't tell them ""42,"" tell them, ""Four tens by a double."" If a friend wants to know where someone is, don't say, ""She's upstairs,"" say, ""Up, up, up. She doesn't stop. She never stops.""

, Keep an eye out for people looking shifty, people carrying suspicious objects, or people speaking differently. Your paranoia would just worsen this, so don't worry if it all turns out to be all right. If nothing goes wrong, just shrug it off. This is a time where you don't have to worry about going overboard. And, if someone does prove to be dangerous, call the cops immediately and protect your friends and yourself at all costs., River's psychic abilities come from being able to feel what others do, as shown in 'Objects in Space' when she sees Zoe and Wash making out. She feels like she is a part of it. Let your heart guide you, not your head. If you feel like someone's acting differently, investigate. If you feel sad, show it. Be a bit like Melanie Martinez's ""Cry Baby"" in the sense that you ""Seem to replace your brain with your heart."", You don't have to be a ninja, but knowing how to throw a punch will probably come in useful. Learn basic stances, how to keep your balance, and distribute power and speed all throughout your body. Some moves you should learn are punches, ""karate chops"", blocks, upper kicks, slide-kicks, and all kata (""practice form""). You can go further if you want to, but these are just the fundamentals., River loves creativity in all forms; she is an amazing artist, dancer, actor, and even more. Although she is gifted in all these fields, she is especially prevalent in dance. You don't have to enjoy dance like River does; you can try singing, acting, painting, stenciling, writing, anything that suits your creative needs. Just try to pick something you would be willing to put all of your energy into, something that you are incredibly passionate about. Make sure you have fun while doing it, above all., Always think logically, even if you're being led by emotion. In 'Jaynestown,' River is shown trying to ""fix"" Shepherd Book's bible because many of the stories aren't logical. If you're reading a book like The Odyssey, then point out that many of the stories don't make any sense. This goes for movies, TV shows, and just anything in general. If someone tells you to do something, asking if you understand, explain it perfectly., Don't be afraid to use big words, correct people's spelling, and do different things such as math problems for fun. Try to excel in all subjects, but pick one to be your favorite. Never brag about your intelligence, though. Be nice about correcting people, and don't act better than other people if you're put in higher classes than them. If you get a bad grade on a test, study hard and ace the next one., This should be something you repeat to yourself over and over again, whether as a warning to others or a way to calm yourself. For River, it's in the infamous ""Two by two; hands of blue."" Yours could be anything from a specific phrase to just repeating a basic word over and over again. So, basically you could say, ""Okay, okay, okay, okay..."" or you could try something specific to you as a person., It's well-known that, in the Firefly universe, Standard Mandarin Chinese and English are the dominant languages. It pays to know a little of both. All of the main characters, including River, speak Chinese at least some of the time. It is mainly used for curses and epithets, but some phrases such as 'mei-mei' are commonly used. There are also a few curse words such as 'gorram' and 'rutting' that exist, as well as some frontier-talk and slang that has survived. It would definitely be worth it to make notes of the curses used in the show, as well as looking up some new language-- it doesn't have to be Chinese --to learn parts of., River has her own fashion (mosaic patterns, sheer outfits, and flowing dresses). This reflects her as a person, because she is general free-spirited and a bit old-fashioned. So, find something that suits your tastes. It can be gothic, it can be preppy, it can be nerdy, it can be whatever you want it to be. Whether it's dressing up in ballgowns every day or throwing on a band T-shirt and leggings, it doesn't matter. Just do what you want and make sure it fits you as a person., Despite the fact that you should always express yourself through clothing, there are a few things when dressing like River that you should try to avoid: anything too futuristic, and anything too restricting. Remember, River was held in an Alliance facility for two years, forced to wear outfits that restricted her movements and were plain in color and style. This is one of the main reasons she dresses like she does; it's possibly one of the most freeing styles out of anyone on Serenity. So try to stay away from metallic patterns or anything with solid colors, and don't wear things like jeans that have rings around the legs, too many bracelets, too many necklaces, etc. Keep it loose and liberating., Being a psychotic fugitive living in sci-fi outer space doesn't leave a lot of time for makeup-- unless you're Inara Serra, that is. If you do wear makeup, keep it natural. Just a bit of concealer. If anything, you could darken the circles under your eyes to make yourself look more tired or draw on bits of scar here and there with lipstick. Don't make these too drastic, though, or they'll look fake., River's hair is often oily and damp, usually wearing it down. Try to keep it natural for the most part, but teasing it a bit to make you look tired is useful. River is never once shown with her hair up. If you have short hair, great, but if you have long hair-- barely ever wear it up."

Get the hair.,
Dress the part.,
Get the gear.",How to Act Like Jim Halpert1," Jim's signature look is a mop-like, shaggy 'do. This tightens up for a bit at the end of season three, but ultimately remains unkempt until season six, when Jim adds a classy edge to his signature messy hair.;

, Jim's romantic success came for his patience. If you truly love someone, wait for them. Forever if that is what it takes. On a different note, Jim's pranks are often effective because of his incredible patience. Don't force your pranks, or they'll be sloppy and ineffective.

, If you drink, make sure you get extra pranky.

, Jim is known for being laid back. Modeling this is wise because getting worked up is rarely a solution. Stay calm, and relax. It's just a job.

, Jim does not like to be frazzled. This only happens several times a season, but when it does, we see just how much Jim cares about certain things (ie Pam giving birth).

, Jim makes lots of pros and cons lists. He is also often the voice of reason. Make wise, informed decisions, and you will limit your regrets.

, Jim can turn a boring moment into something exciting in the blink of an eye. The trait is charisma, and he has it. If you're in a group looking for something to do, don't be afraid to start a topic or group game. Jim also makes spontaneous decisions in romance, too. He kisses Pam on casino night, proposes in the rain, and elopes with her after cutting off his tie before the wedding. Be spontaneous in romance. Like Jim, you won't regret it.

, Jim is not fake. Mean what you say, and people will respect you for it. A corollary to this is: be honest. Honesty is a beautiful thing, and Jim isn't known for being a liar.

Dress as did the starship captain.,
Brush your hair on the left side of your head back and flip your fringe over to the right side of your head.,
Learn to speak as Captain Kirk did in the series.,
Look thoughtful all the time.,
Sit properly at all times.,
Be a ladies man, extraordinaire.,
Fight the right way.,
Gain body bulk and become stout.",How to Act Like James Kirk from Star Trek," Find yourself a mustard yellow shirt - any yellow will do, black trousers and boots. Cut out a Starfleet logo out of cardboard and affix it to the shirt. If needed, use the template provided:;
, If you are bald, find a toupee with said style.

, The real Kirk has three notable ways of speaking; over-punctuating certain words, leaving gaps in-between words mid-sentence and saying entire sentences really quickly. He speaks in a calm yet authoritative tone and has a deep voice. It is important to master all these speech patterns.


The only time diverging from this pattern of speech is acceptable is in times of extreme emotion, particularly anger. If someone has done something that annoys you, simply shout their name as loud and as quickly as possible. This is as much emotion as is allowed.
You can practice the speech patterns with the following guide. Where it says (1), over-punctuate the word next to it, where it says (2) pause before saying the next word, and say the rest of the sentence really quickly after (3):
“The (1)Enterprise (2) is stranded (2) (3) in the Delta Quadrant.”

, Kirk always seems in deep thought, to suggest high intelligence, so you must do the same. Even if you are not thinking of anything, or particularly intelligent, make it look like you are in deep contemplation. Narrow your eyes, look off to either the left or right and remain silent. You may break this when someone wishes to talk to you.

, When seated, it’s important to match Kirk’s seating stance. Sit with either one leg crossed over the other, or with as wide a gap between legs as possible. With one arm on the armrest (either will do), use it to prop your head up and touch your top lip with the index finger. If you also do the above-mentioned thoughtful stare, it will make you look in deep thought, which can be important in some seated situations.

, To complete the illusion, you must flirt with women as much as possible. Looking and dressed the way you are, any woman will already be drawn to you, so the work is half done already. When you strike up a conversation with a woman, say anything even mildly flirtatious or romantic in your new Kirk-style way of talking, and your mission will be complete. Be indiscriminate of gender when you select a woman to seduce. It doesn't matter if she is white, black or green, she’s still a woman, that’s all that matters.

, At some point you may find yourself in a fight, be it with another human or a member of an alien race. Don’t panic, there is a way to come out unscathed. Karate-chopping is the main fighting technique, followed by throwing rocks. When your opponent attempts to attack you, duck. Alternatively, you can hire a stunt double to fight for you. Find someone who has the same body type as you and who will be willing to fight in your stead, then when you find yourself in a fight situation, get your stunt double to fight for you.

, When you get to a certain age, increase your body weight. Any way you can appear to do this is fine. If anyone questions or makes fun of you now, just ignore them. You’re James T. Kirk, you can do whatever you want.

Pick out a few accessories.,

Add lots of color to your lips.,
Experiment with a couple hairstyles.,
Get some kinderwhore hair accessories.",How to Dress Kinderwhore Like Courtney Love," The babydoll dress is the key to the kinderwhore style, but there is quite a bit of freedom in terms of dress style. Babydoll dresses are short dresses that are either billowy or have empire waistlines that flare from the waist. Check thrift shops and second-hand stores to find one that’s a little more distressed, worn, and grungy, as this is integral to the kinderwhore look.Because these dresses are meant to be childlike, look for ones with lace, bows, or ruffles. Courtney Love sometimes wore a babydoll dress with capped sleeves.
She also wore button-down babydoll dresses with Peter Pan collars (flat collars with large rounded ends that meet in the front of the garment). If you're looking to replicate her exact style, look for a black dress with a white collar or a blue dress with a white collar and white-tipped sleeves.
Another babydoll style that Love rocked was the white babydoll with a Peter Pan collar and three-quarter length cuffed sleeves with the cuff rolled up.;
, Black stockings, ripped black fishnets, and white knee-high socks are truest to the Love style, but you can wear any stockings you like.You can personalize the look by wearing any tights you want or even layering different styles of tights, such as wearing fishnets over basic stockings.

, Combat boots and Mary Janes are the most common shoe styles in the kinderwhore look,and Love typically wore Mary Janes with a slight heel or wedge.


Either stick with black Mary Janes (anything low-cut with a strap across the instep) or open-toed Mary Janes in a beige-pink for a true Love kinderwhore style.

, Any jewelry that young girls typically wear is acceptable, such as lockets and charm bracelets,will do, but for the real Courtney Love style, wear a tiara. Aside from that, the only jewelry Love often wore was a little heart necklace.


While Love rarely wore jewelry, she often posed for photos with baby dolls or teddy bears.

, The keys to Courtney Love kinderwhore makeup are thick, dark, smudged eyeliner and full eyelashes.Apply a thick line of black or dark brown eyeliner on your top eyelid, from the inner corner to the outer corner. Below your eye and beneath your lower lashes, trace a line of eyeliner from the outer corner of your eye to the center.


When you have applied the eyeliner, use your finger to smudge and blend the eyeliner on your lid upward so you spread the eyeliner over the bottom of your lid below the crease.Don’t worry about being even or perfect, as the kinderwhore makeup aesthetic is all about looking like a child who put on makeup for the first time.
Below your eye, use your pinky finger to gently smudge the eyeliner. If you want, slightly pull the smudge down from the center of your eye at an angle toward your ears.
When your eyeliner has been applied and smudged, apply multiple layers of mascara on your top eyelashes so they are full and thick.

, One of Love’s most signature looks was the bright red and sometimes smudged lipstick that she wore.For the smudged look, simply apply bright red lipstick to your lips, and don’t worry if it’s not perfect. Use the tip of your finger to smear the lipstick outside the lip line in one or two places.


To achieve the perfect red lips that Love also donned frequently, apply your bright red lipstick, and then trace your lip line with red liner to accentuate the border of your lips.

, Love’s kinderwhore hair was always peroxide blond,she always had bangs, and her hair was either left straight and messy or curled into ringlets.To get your bangs the same, cut them to eye length and leave them hanging down in front of your face. Don’t worry if they aren't perfectly even or if some of the strands are slightly longer than others.
Part your hair down the middle, but zig zag your hairline slightly so it’s not perfectly straight. You can then leave it straight but messy (like you just got out of bed and haven't combed your hair), or use a curling iron to give your hair some curls.
If you do want to die your hair blond, don’t worry about letting the roots grow out by an inch or two. Love usually kept her hair between shoulder and chest length.

, Love often wore a single barrette in her hair on the right side of her face around eye level. To replicate this look, stick a purple, blue, or black barrette (one that contrasts with the blond hair) loosely in your hair, almost so it looks like it will soon fall out.


Other classic kinderwhore hair accessories include ribbons tied in the hair, headbands, and other clips."

It all depends on which design you want to do.,
Make sure you look closely at the photos, identify which type of makeup is used.,
Experiment with several looks.,
Enjoy yourself!",How to Do Ryan Ross Style Stage Makeup," Through pictures we know that Ryan uses liquid eyeliner for the lightning-bolt design. However, this was obvious seeing as it is a ‘’fiddly design, and a pencil would be much too thick. Also, liquid tends to give a more solid color.;
,, All I can really tell you is: for tricky, delicate designs, use liquid eyeliner (ones with a longer brush are better for flexibility etc. ). For the eyeshadow parts, you can use a little brush or a cotton-wool ball, anything that spreads evenly with ease. For the mask-esque designs, you can use liquid or pencil, it doesn’t really matter. For the mask part, outline the shape you’d like with tape, and fill in with eyeshadow. Then, tear off the tape, and you will have a nice, even line.

, Is it eyeliner? Liquid or pencil? Is it eyeshadow? Do I have a color similar to that? What can I use to spread it evenly? These are all questions you should ask yourself.

Understand the statement James Dean made with his clothing.,
Begin by purchasing or finding basic, classic blue jeans.,
Choose the t-shirts that James Dean would have enjoyed wearing.,
Check out the movies for more ideas.,
Choose shoes and boots that reflect James Dean's style.,
Get a black leather jacket.,
Consider wearing your hair like James Dean's.,
Dress up.,
Sport the attitude.",How to Dress Like James Dean," James Dean's clothing was simple and practical, as well as being a sign of the times he lived in, reflecting the youth culture. Yet, even in the midst of simplicity, he made a statement with his leather jacket and denim. Indeed, his Lee 101 Riders jeans epitomized the birth of teen culture and denim became synonymous with rebellion.Unlike previous eras in history where lots of clothing reflected social status and attitude, suddenly dressing down became the fashion statement to go for. On the whole, when allowing yourself to be inspired by James Dean's look, keep it simple and unadulterated and know what fits you well above all; after all, James Dean was never about following fads but about forging his own way in a world that needed reminding that conformity was all a bit of a bore. Dean wouldn't have been impressed with anyone who copycatting his look to the nth degree and looking a fool, so don't do any part of what's suggested in these steps unless it works for you.


Remember that Dean's clothing comes from an era where clothes fitted the body closely, following the human form and hugging it. Nothing baggy, loose or tent-like should be used when trying to achieve the James Dean look.;
, They should be straight legged and of a classic cut. Most importantly, they should be in excellent condition, with no rips, tears or scruffy hems. The jeans should fit well and not be baggy or loose and definitely not hanging off your backside.


If you want a truly authentic look, add cuffs to the leg ends of the jeans or simply turn them up. If that isn't something you're keen to wear, simply ensure that the ends are neat and not frayed.
Most of James Dean's jeans were in the mid to dark blue range, with some wear but still neat.
Add a large belt with an obvious belt buckle to complete the look.

, Again, staying with simplicity, the more common choices for James Dean included:


White t-shirts: It never hurts to have a number of these in the wardrobe, freshly laundered and pressed, ready for wearing. The white tee is very versatile too – it looks good under jackets (especially the leather kind) and by itself.
Muscle cut polo shirts: Obviously, to show off the muscle work and generally look rebellious and cool.

, If you like James Dean and want to dress like him, your best source of ideas will be found in his movies. Of course, he had designers working out a lot of these clothes but they evoked a style of an era and Dean wasn't averse to wearing many of the same clothes off the big screen either. Here are some of the things you might discover when watching them:


If you're going for a movie look, Rebel Without a Cause and East of Eden are worth watching as those demonstrate his greatest movie outfits.


Rebel Without a Cause, he sported a red cotton windbreaker jacket, which you can buy on Dean's official website, a white V-neck muscle cut shirt, and worn dark jeans, with very simple black engineer boots.

East of Eden was his ""good boy look"", he wore a khaki colored v-neck sweater, under it a white or light blue polo shirt, khaki slacks or pants, with brown dress shoes, or gray converse Chuck Taylor's.



, The choices here are fairly easy:


Work boots: Some classic black boots, which are plain and unadorned are the ideal choice. Pair these with plain white socks. If there's a heel on them, so much the better.
Simple converse shoes or similar for casual wear are fine. Again, pair with very basic, plain socks.

, This is probably one of the most remembered iconic pieces of clothing worn by Dean. Like the white t-shirt and denim jeans, it's a simple piece that can be worn with a number of items easily.


When wearing the jacket, have the collar flipped ""up"" (pop it), if you have to take it off, hang it over your shoulder.
As noted earlier, Dean also wore a rebellious red jacket in Rebel without a cause, which gives a bit of variety to your wardrobe.

, James Dean sported a pompadour. This was the only style that he ever wore, so if it's one you like, consider adopting it as well. However, it's a good idea to speak with your hairdresser about the practicalities of looking after it and whether or not it will suit your face shape, etc.


The swept back look can be done in varying degrees of severity, so let your hairdresser help you choose what is best for your needs.
If you do have a pompadour, always have a comb; when your hair looks good, you'll feel good, and when a sexy girl passes by, comb the side of your hair. Back in the 50's, men told women they were sexy through combing their hair near them, or when they passed by.

, For dress clothes, Dean was still very simplistic in his style. When he wore a tuxedo, he wore a white dinner jacket with a slim black tie, black slacks, with black patent leather shoes (very shinny black shoes).


When at a casual dress occasion, he usually sported a wool sports jacket, in the brown or khaki colors, a white or cream colored button down shirt, thin brown belt, khaki pants, and brown dress shoes – never wear square toe shoes, always round.
The long overcoat worn in this image was also a Dean trademark. It's a great addition for the colder weather.

, Finally, while clothes make you appear interesting, your personality is what really draws people in. Flirting gently, being an all-round pleasant guy and being helpful around women is a Dean-like way to be, while being cool, tough and not sensitive is a Dean-like approach to hanging around with the guys.


Shrug off the rudeness of others. It's not worth your while to chase compliments or confirm people's nastiness by stooping to their level.

Stand up for yourself. Dean didn't like violence; he was tough but not rough. Use your smarts and your wit to maneuver around the violent people you come across and don't be a bully.

Go with the flow.",How to Be Like Kesha," Ke$ha doesn't always wear crazy stage makeup, but it is her go-to when she goes out. Black eyeshadow and smudged eyeliner are a must. She often wears more makeup around her right eye, inspired by A Clockwork Orange, like a star or a lightning bolt. The patterns are all very original, ranging from the black running eyeliner look, to the neon bright slash marks.


Ke$ha describes her making as being ""whatever's left over from the night before.""Obviously she doesn't put much thought into it! If people think perfect makeup is needed to be beautiful, they're wrong.;
, The more, the merrier. Ke$ha says she spends thousands of dollars on glitter every month.Saying she wears a lot of glitter would be an understatement. She often paints it on her face and body in crazy patterns. And there is not a color she wouldn't wear!


A pro tip? Spray hairspray wherever the glitter is on your body (aka everywhere) to seal it. It's a routine Ke$ha and her bandmates go through prior to any show., Ke$ha's bedhead curls are natural. But if you don't have hair like Ke$ha's, then wash your hair at night with shampoo and conditioner, braid it, and go to bed. You could also spray some curl-activating spray into it. When you wake up, your hair should be dry. Take it out and take a look. If your hair isn't curly enough, spray more curl-activating spray, scrunch your hair, and curl it with a curling iron.


Her hair isn't neat, either. If it is lying smooth, or you have thin hair, tease it a bit to give it some volume. Imagine partying at the club all night long, hitting up Jack In The Box, pounding some Red Bull, walking home, and going straight to church. That's her look. Well, minus the church part.

, Ke$ha would literally pilfer an AC/DC shirt out of a dumpster if she had the opportunity. Apart from dumpsters, she gets most of her clothes from thrift stores. Most of her shirts are band tee-shirts with her favorite bands on them -- you can get good band tops at shops like Hot Topic. Also try bright print t-shirts or tops with sequins and glitter. Remember that Ke$ha often wears black, but the patterns can be any color. Anything wild works too.


She wears short-shorts a lot of the time. And she definitely has the legs for it! As for the overall look, if it's a little over-the-top, that's her. She loves layers, tons of accessories, bright colors, and anything that has pizzazz.

, Back in her animal studying days, she learned that animals love anything that shines. People are the same she argues, so she always employs lots of shine. Even when she's on the red carpet, she glimmers.Whether she dresses up or down, she's sparkling.


Think about sparkly, bangle bracelets, sequined tops and bottoms, sparkly shoes, and crazy, eye-catching nail polish. If it attracts your attention, it probably fits the look.

, Ke$ha is often found sporting tights underneath her short-shorts. They're usually black and they're usually ripped to shreds. Grab a few pairs that you haven't worn in years and take the scissors to 'em. Just make sure they don't look like you purposefully ripped them up yourself!


The best way to do this is to put the tights on and then start poking holes. Make the holes tiny initially and then stretch the material to make it run. The more haphazard and unintentional it looks, the better.

, Ke$ha says herself that she can't walk in heels, much less dance. She also says that girls don't need push up bras and heels to be attractive.Basically, she's awesome. So put away those heels and hit the dance floor in those high tops. Why not?


She is often seen in undone high tops or boots. Laces are for people who haven't gone platinum and don't bathe in glitter. Only lace up your shoes if they won't stay on. Otherwise, let 'em fly free.

, That's right: Ke$ha now has her own entire line of jewelry. It's called ""Kesha Rose.""Some of it's pretty expensive, but some of it is cheap, too. Could there be an easier way to be Ke$ha pre-approved? Probably not.

, Ke$ha does not care what other people think of her; she has a very care-free attitude. She can be wild, but try not to overdo it. Acting too over-the-top can lead to trouble with your peers and your school or job.


It's very important to be your own person. Ke$ha doesn't care what the popular kids are doing, wearing, or what they look like. If you wanna be like her, do what comes naturally to you. Others' opinions aren't even on your radar.

, Unlike most pop artists Ke$ha writes most of her own songs. She has written and recorded over 200 songs, but only 24 are released in the USA. If you want to write music like hers, listen to Ke$ha's lyrics. They are not deep or very meaningful, but they do tell more about her.


Ke$ha apparently hated two girls named Jeanie and Katie, and she wrote about it in Back$tabber. Her song N-N-N-Neva Baby is about a creepy guy having a crush on her, and her song Disgusting is about her liking a guy a lot, and her wishing that she didn't like him so much. D-I-N-O-$-A-U-R is about creepy old guys. Whatever the topic is, she makes it catchy and fun.

, There's no two ways around it: Ke$ha parties hardy. She parties like it's 1999. She fights for her right to party. If she has any downtime, she's partying. So go to parties with your friends or even throw them! Now how would Ke$ha decorate the house?

, Whenever Ke$ha is asked a ridiculous question, she always rolls with it. ""Do you always brush your teeth with a bottle of Jack?"" She would say, ""Yes, all the time -- now do you want a tattoo with my new tattoo gun?"" She's totally goofy. And she gets away with it!


Do this more around your friends than your parents and teachers. If your English teacher asks you about the book you're reading, don't reply with ""I got my glasses and I'm out the door. I'm gonna hit the city!"" That won't go over well. But you and your friends can be as goofy as you can imagine.

, Ke$ha does this thing that's called ""vocal fry."" Think about how Britney Spears says ""Oh baby, baby"" in Hit Me Baby One More Time. That's vocal fry. It mostly happens at the end of sentences. It's a creaky voice. The same voice you might make to scare your friends is something Ke$ha uses all the time.


Apart from vocal fry, she's really enthusiastic and fun. She's very happy and energetic -- and her voice is too! When you're talking, try to be upbeat. She talks like her songs feel (which makes sense, because she's writing them!).

, Ke$ha is starting a fake-fur line and has animal-friendly jewelry. Clearly caring about the environment is important to her -- and it should be! All of us should be concerned with life around us. To be like her, stay away from fur, leather, and products that are tested on animals.


Ke$ha donated 1,000 pounds of dog and cat food to shelters in Nashville. She's vegetarian and just loves, loves, loves animals. She has a cat named Mr. Peep$ and he even has his own Twitter!, Ke$ha is learning a whole bunch of different instruments, so pick practically any one and she's learning it. Right now, it's the guitar.But she knows how to play piano and the keytar, too! She's really musically inclined having practically grown up in a studio (her mom was a songwriter, too). She even writes songs for Miley Cyrus!


She's very into rock n' roll, so if you pick an instrument that can be put in a band, double bonus points. The guitar, drums, keyboard or piano are all really good choices. But any instrument is better than none!

, You gotta get your fix on all things Ke$ha, so watch all her music videos! Notice how off-the-beaten-path she is and all the little crazy things she gets away with. She always pushes the envelope. Her makeup is often funky but not always -- she can do simple and she can do ridiculous! That's why she's so great.


She can go from super girly in ""Take It Off"" and ""Your Love is My Drug"" to gangsta chic in ""Crazy Kids."" In short, she can do it all. But she always makes it big and eye-catching.

, In order to get in tune with Ke$ha, you gotta memorize her lyrics. She always tells it like it is, so you'll be speaking the truth. You probably have all her lyrics memorized already, don't you?.

, Check out her website for details. She's quite the entertainer and you'll probably end up covered in glitter (she sometimes rocks a glitter cannon!), but that's the idea, right?


Ask your parents if you're under 18 for permission to go. Concerts can get pretty wild and crazy and it may be best to a have a ride to and from the venue. And maybe mom can help chip in for the ticket costs or a t-shirt!

, It's called ""Ke$ha: My Crazy Beautiful Life."" Fair warning, she does some pretty ridiculous stuff! Her life really is quite crazy. But for a sneak peek, there's no better look -- it's even filmed by her older brother Lagan., The number one thing about Ke$ha is that she doesn't take herself too seriously, she doesn't take dating too seriously, and she doesn't take life too seriously. She just rolls with it. Whatever it is, it's cool. She's cool. It's all cool. Nothing's too dramatic or a big deal. It's always chill.


So, in short, to be like her, be drama-free. She's not caught up in images or who has what or the he-said-she-said or even money, despite it being her signature symbol. It's about being happy and care-free. What a great mantra!

Don’t be “too good” for anyone.,
Find the art in everyday life.",How to Be a Sexy Blues Chick," Quit stressing and worrying about the perceived negative parts of your life, and glamorize them instead. So you’re broke? Many of the best artists were broke and it forced them to abandon materialism and focus on their art. So you’re lonely and loveless? All the best blues songs are about broken hearts. Recognize your problems as making you a deeper, more thoughtful person.;
, Blues artists are all about improvisation. This helps them to develop an unflappable, always in control frame of mind. They’re always in control because even when the unexpected happens (either during a jam session or in everyday life), they know how to improvise and roll with the punches. Don’t fear the future. Trust your resourcefulness to get you through any future jams, it always has in the past.

, The women of blues have always been ahead of their time. The earliest artists were sassy, the leaders in their relationships, they weren’t afraid to get into scraps. Stay in control but don’t be afraid to stick up for yourself. Do what you feel is right, then you’ll never need to make apologies. Always be yourself and be honest.

, In the early days of blues, the female vocalists often made more money and had more fame than the men in their lives. If you’re in a relationship, only keep a man around if you have good times together, not because you need him for money or for a confidence boost or any other reason.

, Bessie Smith, Ma Rainey, Billie Holiday, and more modern artists like Aaliyah and Erykah Badu will mellow you out with their grooves, and their lyrics will inspire you to be a confident, independent woman who doesn’t stress about the hard times in life.

, Blues artists don’t sweat it if they don’t look like the stereotypical beauties. They work with what they’ve got and make it sexy with their confidence. If you’re big, love it. Blues hotties are too busy thinking deep thoughts about their art or getting rowdy with their friends to spend too much time on the makeup. They look natural, effortless, though sometimes add some eyeliner or red lipstick to look as if they just came from a show. Natural hair is always best, though marcelled waves really kick up your 20’s look a notch for a more formal occasion or a performance.

, The blues originated among the poor populations, so you don’t need much money to pull of a sexy blues fashion style. Thin cotton dresses are perfect for performing in a smoky, hot New Orleans club in the days before air conditioning. The more vintage the better, especially from the hey-day of blues, the 1920s and 1930s. Flapper style dresses, stockings, and heels take the look to the max. Accessories could include feather hair accessories, brooches, and long strings of bead necklaces. A fedora can be hot when paired with an otherwise feminine outfit. If you want to have a more subtle, contemporary look, just add one of these items to jazz up one of your modern outfits. Colors like black, blue (of course), deep reds, dark greens, and rich purples always work. Wear vintage style lingerie like thigh high stockings with garter belts, tap short panties, bloomers or silky nightgowns.

, Blues artists were among the first to bring sex into mainstream art. They enjoyed sex and didn’t care who knew it. They flaunted their sexuality, flirted openly, and celebrated their enjoyment of pleasure. In our day and age it’s not safe to have sex so casually, so understand the difference between feeling sexy and enjoying your sexuality and actually having sex. Just feel good in your body and treat the men in your life like they’re sex objects. Don’t worry, they’ll enjoy it. Blues women turned the tables on sexual traditions, so if you like a certain fella, don’t be afraid to flirt or make the first moves. If he’s not into you, don’t act hurt or put any pressure on him. You just want him for a good time, and if he’s not down, there’s plenty of other good times to be had elsewhere.

, Blues women were always out at bars and shows. They were always good for a party. Clara Bow epitomized their attitude when she said “here today, gone tomorrow…. How about a drink?” Basically, life is short, live it up. But be responsible, so your life won’t be TOO short. Unfortunately many blues artists made this mistake.

, Blues artists came from humble origins and knew that no one was better than anyone else. They were open minded to everyone and knew that everyone had something to contribute to their lives. They’d treat a homeless person as well as a high class person. Also, if an “uncool” guy asks you to dance, dance with him. Dance with everyone. Its just a dance. Taking yourself too seriously is uncool.

, Blues artists lived life as if living itself was an art, as if everything they did was an opportunity to express themselves and their culture. This was especially evident in the way they spoke. Blues language and slang is colorful and creative! Throw some blues terms into your everyday language. Any males are “cats,” women are “mamas.” Flirt with men by calling them “big boy,” or “sugar.” A term of endearment for anyone is to call them “baby.” If you’re going to dance, you’re going to “boogie.” If something is good, it’s “bad.” If you don’t know a guy’s name, call him “Jack.”

Opt for a one-piece jumpsuit instead of the traditional pants and a shirt.When you select a pair of pants, make sure they are high waisted, tight and flair out at the bottom.
If you’d like to try something slightly different, opt for a one-piece jumpsuit. It should fit snuggly, but the pant legs should be slightly flared.
To find this style of clothing, try looking at local vintage stores. You could also shop at Goodwill, if you’re looking for more of a selection.
For an authentic look, try searching online for an Elvis style jumpsuit.;
, Elvis was known for his bright and bold color choices, so don’t hold back when it comes to adding blues and pinks to your wardrobe. Black should be included as well, particularly if it’s black leather.


Embrace bright colors, as Elvis did. Try to tie in the chosen color with other accessories. For example, if Elvis wore a pink shirt, he paired it with a pink belt and socks.Another way to add a pop of color is to include some bedazzling on your clothes. For example, if you choose a solid black one-piece bodysuit, add a homemade touch to it by applying some embellishments. Elvis often sported homemade looks., Blue Suede Shoes, wasn’t just a song; it was also a look Elvis sported.The bright colors worked perfectly with his flamboyant style, so find a pair of shoes that works for you as well.


If you can’t find actual blue suede shoes, find another pair of bright colored shoes that can be your signature look.
If you’re going for a more authentic look, you can find plenty of blue suede shoe options online. Just do a Google search for, “buy blue suede shoes,” and choose which pair works best for you.

, Nothing says rockstar better than a pair of sunglasses. However, if you’re trying to look like the king of rock and roll, opt for a pair of aviators.


Although any pair of aviators will do, a more authentic look is thicker, gold aviators.
Have fun with it, though. You’re a rockstar so don’t be afraid to go big and bold!

, Embrace the rockstar lifestyle by adding some flashy jewelry. Elvis wore lots of sparkly accessories, such as gold rings adorned with diamonds, which made him stand out.When it came to style, Elvis was ahead of his time. Take chances when it comes to your accessories. Whatever you choose as your signature look, embrace it and wear it with pride. In doing so, you’ll be a trendsetter just as Elvis was.
If you’re going for a more authentic look, consider purchasing big, gold rings with diamonds - think Super Bowl rings. Wear one, two or even three, like Elvis did.

, Complete your look with a leather jacket. If you’re feeling extra daring go for an all leather look.


Purchase a leather jacket. You can pair the jacket with just about anything, but consider wearing a white, v-neck shirt underneath.
For the full effect, add a pair of leather pants. Elvis didn’t shy away from wearing head to toe leather., Although many musicians from the 50’s donned the pompadour hairstyle, none did it quite as well as Elvis.To style your hair into a pompadour, you will need either wax, gel or pomade and a comb.
Using the comb, lift all of your hair up. Now dip your fingers into the wax, gel or pomade, making sure to coat them well.
Apply the wax, gel or pomade to your hair. Be generous with how much you apply. Your hair should feel fairly slick and wet.
Slick back the hair by starting at the back of your head. Do 4 inches at a time.
Once the hair has been slicked back, place one hand in the middle of the top of your head and use the other hand to hold the comb. Now push the front half of your hair forward with your hand, while using the comb to style is straight into the air.
Once the hair is straight up in the air, roll it back into a wave with your comb. Add more wax, gel or pomade to keep the wave in place.
Make sure the remaining back half of your hair is still slicked back, by going over it with a comb and more product.

, Elvis was known for sporting the mutton chop sideburns, which meant his sideburns came down to corner of his mouth. He varied the look, though, sometimes preferring to keep his sideburns trimmed and a bit more polished. Feel free to experiment with your look as well.To get Elvis sideburns, it helps to start with a full beard. Shave the beard back, leaving only a large triangle shaped piece around the ears.
To get a feel for the length, align the base of the triangle with your mouth.
For those who are unable to grow sideburns, consider purchasing an Elvis wig. Do a search online for, “Elvis wig with sideburns.” You’ll notice there are many options and price ranges, so choose one that works best for you.

, You may not realize it, but Elvis’s jet black hair color wasn’t natural. You, too, can achieve the same look as the king of rock and roll by dying your hair jet black.


Choose a dark brown dye. Elvis used a combination of dark brown and black velvet.For a temporary look, try a non-permanent hair dye. This way, you aren’t committed to jet black hair and can experiment with the right color. You can either purchase the dye at any major retail store or can pay a professional in a salon to give you an Elvis makeover.
Once you’ve found the best color combination, consider switching to a permanent dye. Be aware that in order to keep his hair healthy, Elvis used aloe vera regularly. Try buying some and working it into a lather when you shampoo, to keep your hair looking glossy like Elvis’s did., Elvis’s southern drawl made women swoon. To get the accent down, watch videos of Elvis on Youtube or rent one of his movies such as, Love Me Tender.


Listen to how he talks and practice saying things as he would, making sure to use a similar intonation.

, When watching videos of Elvis, take note of his lip curl. You’ll notice that his lip curl was more of a snarl, with the lip curving to the left.


Look at pictures online by searching, “Elvis lip curl.”
Practice doing the lip curl with a mirror.
Once you have the lip curl down, try speaking while your lip is curled.

, When it came to using the word “honey,” Elvis didn’t differentiate between men and women. He used “honey” when speaking to everyone.


For example, “Well, honey, I am the king of rock and roll,” or “I am the king of rock and roll, honey.”

, To complete the rock and roll look, purchase a guitar and learn how to play it. Choose songs of his to play on the guitar, such as Hound Dog or Jailhouse Rock.


Elvis played a range of guitars but favored a Gibson or a Martin. Do a search online for Gibson and Martin guitars and select one that fits within your price range.
More serious guitar players should visit a local Gibson or Martin retail store to get a feel for the different types of options available.
You can really use any type of acoustic guitar though, as your end goal is to be able to play some basic songs. The guitar can even be used as more of a prop.Learn to play the guitar either by watching Youtube videos online or buy taking guitar lessons from a professional.
You can find Youtube videos online that will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to play Elvis songs. For example, you can do a search for “How to play That’s All Right Momma, by Elvis Presley.”

, If you’re not a gifted singer, consider taking vocal lessons. You can also listen to Elvis Presley songs and try to mimic his sound.


Watch the video, “Three Essential Elements to Singing Like Elvis,” on Youtube. It highlights the quality of Elvis’s voice, along with the power and wide range he had.
You can also purchase videos, which will help you sing like Elvis, such as “Sing Like the King.”
More than anything, listen to Elvis sing and practice mimicking his vocals.

, In addition to singing Elvis songs, focus on rock and gospel music as a whole.


Elvis combined both rock and gospel, along with a little country, to get his signature sound. He reinvented the music industry with his sound.
Don’t stay within the confines of modern music. The title, king of rock and roll was given to Elvis because he pushed boundaries. Get creative with your sound.

, Elvis sent America into a frenzy with his hip gyrations. To complete your transformation into the king of rock, add some hip gyrations into your performance.To do the Elvis hip gyration, bend your knees slightly and make a circular motion with your hips. Thrust your pelvis forward, for extra flair and drama.
Take it to the next level by spreading your arms straight out to your sides while you’re doing the hip gyration. Snap to the beat of the music.

Love life!",How to Be Like a Pop Star," This is one of the most important things that sets pop stars apart. They never shy away from big crowds and paparazzi, and they always walk with a certain swagger that denotes confidence. Always be willing to stand up and show everyone who you are.;
, Own a cell phone and laptop and spend a lot of time calling and texting your friends. Use different social media apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter in addition to your normal texting. Interact with as many people as possible so that you can build a large social network. Have a wide range of friends, but don't forget to build special relationships with a couple best friends - even though you want to cultivate your popularity, you should never abandon your besties.

, Pop stars are not always smart, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't be. Being well-educated will also help you learn about other countries and cultures, and you can use your knowledge to try to gain popularity with them as well as with your own. Pay attention in class, stay organized, and if you need help, ask a teacher or a tutor.

, If your idol is a pop star, then use their story and their image as guidance for cultivating your own. Try to follow in their footsteps to become a true pop star. Your idol doesn't have to be a pop star, however. Still, having someone to look up to will motivate you to keep striving after your dreams, whatever they are.

, Whether it's playing the guitar, dancing, cheerleading, or math, find a couple of things you are good at and are passionate about. Cultivate these things and develop the confidence in them that a pop star has in singing.

, Exercise for about 30 mins a day and cut down on processed foods to eat healthy. This will help you look and feel better and have a healthier lifestyle throughout your life.

, Take care of your skin. Moisturize your body every day, and use a pimple cleanser or special face wash if you have acne. Wear small amounts of makeup to highlight your best features and make you look cute and cool, but be sure not to overdo it. Take care to shower and brush your teeth regularly, and practice good manners, especially while eating, to emphasize your cleanliness and sophistication.

, Have good fashion sense. Build up your wardrobe with cool, trendy, fashionable clothing, and match clothes to create the perfect outfit for any occasion. Use accessories to top off any look. Start with a couple cute graphic tees, jeans, skirts, and patterned leggings. Get a variety of dresses and two nice coats. You'll also need formal shirts and flats, heels, and casual shoes or sneakers, as well as a couple of sweaters, patterned or plain. Round out your wardrobe with a couple of handbags and cute hats. Shop with friends to build the perfect wardrobe.

, If someone needs your help or is feeling down, comfort them. Part of being a pop star is having the ability to touch other people's lives through music. Even if you can't reach quite as many people as Beyonce, reach out to those you can, and try to comfort them and bring them joy.

, If someone teases you, get them back, but by your wit and knowledge rather than brawn. If you get bullied, walk away and tell someone about it.

, Develop a unique personality that will define what kind of pop star you want to be.

, You're practically a pop star; enjoy it!

Maintain your charm.",How to Look Like Rihanna," This is one of her best-known looks and it’s cute and sexy at the same time. If you want to try this look, you should wear Converse, baggy jeans, cropped tops showing off that tanned belly button, sequins, sparkles, and not too much pink. The most important thing is that you look young and sexy at the same time.


Pair baggy bottoms with tight tops to maintain a sexy look. If you don’t want to show off your belly, you don’t have to do it.
Go for the medium makeup look here, wearing light eyeliner, bronze shadow, and mauve lipstick.;
, For a more edgy Rihanna look, try killer heels, leopard print, purple highlights, bright colors, cropped tops showing off that cute tattoo on your hip, and liquid eyeliner at the ready. You can also wear some fishnet stockings, black leather pants, and strappy sandals if you prefer that.


This look works best paired with smoky makeup.

, Every summer, there are hundreds of photographs of Rihanna enjoying the beach in Barbados in a gorgeous bikini. She wears string bikinis, bikinis with small cups, bikinis that are more subtle, and really anything that flatters her body. She wears pale blues, pinks, and purples, though she’s been seen rocking a black bikini, too. She doesn’t tend to wear very full bikini underwear and is proud of her body.


Pair that bikini with a simple exotic skirt, a tight tank top, and a big, beam-like smile.
You can opt for the minimal makeup look to match your beach persona.
You can also wear a lacy white bikini top paired with a white lacy skirt.

, Sometimes Rihanna likes a more casual, more sporty look, and she rocks it to the fullest. Just get a jersey with your favorite athlete’s name on the back, some sexy sweats or track shorts, and pair them with a pair of white or black Nikes or high tops. You can even tie it all together with a black zip-up jacket and a black backwards cap.This look goes great with a black, sporty bob.
You can also wear a loose white t-shirt or black leggings for this sporty look.
Rihanna wears simple dangling gold necklaces with her sporty look.

, During her “Music of the Sun” days, Rihanna always took loose denim to the next level, whether she was dressed up with a cropped blazer or paired it with a pair of funky Chuck Taylor All Star Converse. She absolutely adored this style of denim, and it’s a perfect look for a nice warm day or if you’re going for a younger, fresher, less sexy look.


She also likes throwing a denim jacket over black cotton dresses or jumpsuits.
She also wears faded denim jeans that she sometimes rolls up to her calves.

, During her “Girl Like Me” days, Rihanna loved wearing adorable short shorts. Rihanna was seen wearing a variety of short shorts in different styles and colors when she was out on the town or just hanging out during the day. One of the most famous was when performing “SOS” live at MTV. This is a cute look that works best for people who love showing off their legs.


You can pair the shorts with casual sneakers or strappy sandals for a more fancy look.
She likes wearing ripped, studded jean shorts as well.

, Rihanna is known for her gold and silver jewelry, but she never overdoes it. The most important thing is to wear just enough jewelry and accessories to complete your look without letting it steal the scene. Here are some accessories that Rihanna often wears:


Thick gold hoops
Bigger, thinner gold hoops
Big diamond studs
A turquoise bead necklace
Gold bangles
Purple or blue sunglasses
A black-and-white striped clutch
Pearl earrings with a touch of gold

, Rihanna has been seen rocking almost every pair of shoes you can imagine, from the most casual slippers to the dressiest heels. If you want to wear heels like Rihanna, just make sure you’re comfortable walking around in them. For a more casual day, some slippers will do just fine. Here are some Rihanna-inspired shoe styles you can wear:


Black velvet slippers
Tan gladiator sandals
Black strappy heels
Silver strappy stilettos
Simple tan heels with an ankle strap
Black kitten heels
White sneakers for a more casual look

, Rihanna certainly agrees with it. One of the most famous thing about Rihanna's style is black. Try black shoes, shirts, pants, skirts, dresses...anything!

, This is also another one of Rihanna's biggies. Leather delivers the perfect bad-girl look, just like Rihanna's!


If you can, try black leather for a super, like Rihanna style.

, These are two of her most signature looks, and if you want to look like Rihanna, then you can see if one of them suits you. Either hairstyle will work if you already have long, thick hair. You may not even need to get a weave done and may just need a good bottle of color and regular trips to the salon instead. Here are some things to consider:


The blonde weave is worn sometimes wavy, sometimes long, straight, and lustrous.
The bob is sexy and choppy. Remember, though, that bobs are very high maintenance and usually cannot be worn as a “wash and go” hairstyle, unless your hair is dead straight, especially if you get a fringe (bangs) as well. Plus, both these styles need commitment and looking after or they start looking cheap and tatty after a while, so you may need to consider costs and effort first.

, Rihanna loves changing up her hair color and you can do the same if you want to emulate her look. She has been seen with hair in almost every color of the rainbow and always looks gorgeous and stylish while rocking a variety of different looks. Here are some looks you can try:


A cute pink choppy bob
Shaving the sides of your head with short red hair on top, just above your ears
Long dark red hair with very coiled, tight curls
Straight black hair
A short blonde bob with longer bangs with streaks of black in them
Shaving the left side of your head and flipping long black hair over to the right

, Using products such as ProActive Formula works by clearing out your pores and making your skin tone more even. Using this with a good foundation and a hint of bronzer will quickly give you that youthful, delicate glow that Rihanna has spent years achieving under the Caribbean sun. If your skin is the same shade as Rihanna's, a gorgeous honey color that darkens in summer, then count yourself blessed, as half the work is done.


If you have light or porcelain-colored skin, it is good to use a moisturizer that has a hint of self-tan. Using this every day will build up a nice tan for you to work with. You can also get less greasier versions for your face.
If you have darker skin than Rihanna’s, then don’t try to lighten it. You don’t need to do that to achieve Rihanna’s look.

, Rihanna has gorgeous, full, luscious lips. She tends to wear bright red Marilyn Monroe-style lipstick, though she occasionally opts for a more subtle or shimmery and glossy pink or mauve color. If you want to make your lips fuller, then you should find a lip liner the same color as your lips and work to apply it on your lip line for a fuller effect. You can apply your lip gloss lightly and know that there’s no need to put layers upon layers of lipstick on over your lips.


Rihanna also has a defined cleft in her top lip, so you can try to get some extra definition with a lip-liner.
Just make sure not to overdo it with the lip-liner. If your lips are naturally thin, you can make them a bit fuller, but if you go too far, it won’t look natural.

, Unlike some celebrities, Rihanna doesn’t change up her eyebrows very much. They have a nice, subtle curved arch to them before tapering off, and they aren’t too long and of medium thickness. Just use an eyebrow comb to shape them into place and then a brown eyebrow pencil to even them out.


Sometimes her eyebrows are a bit thinner after the arch, so you can pluck them a bit thinner on the sides to achieve that look.
As far as eyebrows go, hers are just a bit farther apart than the average brows.

, Rihanna likes to emphasize her gorgeous green eyes wherever she goes. She usually lines the top of her eyelids with thick black eyeliner while leaving her bottom lids more bare, with just a bit of brown eyeliner or shadow below her bottom lids. She can go for a more smoky-eyed, dramatic look, or a softer, more subtle look, depending on the occasion. Here are the different looks you can try:For the smoky-eyed look, go for a thicker black eyeliner on your top lids, an extra coat of thickening mascara, and a dark gray shadow on your top lids and a little bit below those bottom lids. Add a bit of brown or purple shadow to your brow bone, above the darker shadow, to blend the look more naturally. This look works great with a mauve lipstick.
For a more natural look, skip out on the eyeliner. Simply apply some nude or shimmery pink shadow to your lids with some light mascara and you’ll be good to go. This looks great with her signature red lipstick.
For an in-between look, use bronze eye shadow and then line your upper eyelids to give yourself cat eyes, making your lines extend outside your eyes and curve upward a bit. Use mascara of medium thickness and complete the look with pink lipstick.

, Rihanna has gorgeous long lashes that make her eyes look absolutely stunning. If you want to get her look, just use a bit of black thickening mascara on your lashes, making sure to carefully move it from side to side and up along your lashes, instead of just up and down, to fully coat them in the mascara.


You can also use an eyelash curler to make those lashes even more curled and dramatic.
Sometimes, Rihanna has fun with fake lashes. Try putting on a pair of these for a dramatic effect if you want a more fun, dramatic look.

, Whether it is during a photo shoot or just getting photographed in the street, Rihanna is nearly always spotted in this position. This position is frequently used by many models and celebrities, and gives an illusion of a toned arm and well balanced body figure. lf you’re posing for photos or just hanging out, aim for this position when it feels right. This will give you that awesome Rihanna swagger you’re going for.


You can mix it up and put your left hand on your hip for a change.

, Rihanna always keeps things interesting by constantly reinventing herself, much like her idol, Madonna. Never stop looking for new ways to style your hair, change up your makeup, or rock a new outfit. Just when you think you’re comfortable in a certain Rihanna look, change yourself completely.


Learn to be happy and comfortable with how you look, no matter which trend you’re rocking.

, Rihanna is proud of her Bajan roots and is always talking about how much she embraces her heritage and how much she has learned from it. She also frequently travels home to Barbados and hasn’t forgotten the people she left behind. Whether your roots are in Nigeria or New Jersey, make sure you’re proud of where you came from and that you never feel “too good” to take a trip back home.Part of Rihanna’s identity is definitely based in her roots, and you should be proud of where you came from, too. If you feel like where you came from isn’t as exciting as Barbados, then you should do a bit more digging to realize that every person has an interesting background.

, Rihanna is the first to admit she’s not perfect. She’s comfortable talking about her past and how it’s made her a stronger person and how she won’t let other people’s mistakes influence her, either. Don’t think you have to be perfect if you want to emulate Rihanna. In fact, you should be proud of your imperfections and should be excited to move on from them.


Don’t get defensive or angry if people ask you about one of your missteps. Instead, be open to talking about it.

, Rihanna is charming, cute, funny, and intriguing all at the same time. If you want to have her attitude, then you have to work on keeping your cool, and if you don’t like something, try to laugh it off instead of being aggressive. Always be armed with a cute, warm smile and a happy glint in your eye and don’t be ashamed of where you came from or who you are.


Your sweetness shouldn’t feel fake or like a put-on, but completely genuine. Watch how Rihanna talks in interviews; she’s classy and charming while maintaining her sense of humor all the while.

First of all, lets go over what smells the most: Hair, clothes, body, breath, and hands.,
For the hair: Wear a hat that you can deodorize, or pull your hair back.,
For clothes, the best thing to do is to have a change of clothes, but you can't always do that.,
Believe it or not your body doesn't smell as much as you might think (at least from the smoke :P).,
For your breath, obviously you want to use mints or gum.,
Smokers know that hands smell, and often times that's the first place they check.,
Finally, USE A SPLOOF!",How to Smoke and Not Smell," You can eliminate all of these if you try hard enough.;
, if neither of these are possible, just try to keep your hair out of the smoke. After smoking, use spray deodorant or citrus spray or something to mask the smell (but don't over-do it)

, Remove any jackets or scarves or anything you can, so they don't absorb the smoke. After smoking you can use dryer sheets or an odor eliminator spray to remove the smell. Febreze works best because it neutralizes odor instead of masking it.

, Really there isn't much you can do about it except showering, or using lotion/deodorant.

, Again, don't over-do it because it can be obvious your hiding something (sometimes you can be tricked into thinking you smell when its just your breath, because your mouth and nose are connected)

, Use a piece of paper or a wrapper or something to keep any part of the object being smoked from touching your hand. The smell is especially transferred when inhaling.

, If you don't know what that is, it's a toilet paper tube or any tube filled with lots of dryer sheets. You exhale through this device and the smoke leaves it with a fresh scent.

Choose your rolling paper.,
Prepare and grind the marijuana.,
Make your mix.,
Make the filter tip.,
Roll the joint.,
Rolling inside out.",How to Roll a Marijuana Joint1," Choose thin rice or wheat straw paper in standard or king size. Plan to tear your paper down to size--wide and square is a good starting shape that offers versatility. You can get papers online, in convenience stores, at your dispensary, and at tobacco shops.






Look for papers that burn slowly, evenly, and won’t give a bad flavor. Some good papers to use include RAW natural hemp rolling papers, Smoking papers and orange Zig-zags (if you’re feeling old-school).
If you plan to carry your papers around with you, get a rolling paper protector. Put your rolling papers in this metal case to prevent them from bending and tearing.
Carry spare paper. Gummed strips torn from a spare paper are great for mending tears, leaks, and gaps.;
, Handle the flower heads with care to protect the delicate THC glands and use a weed grinder or sharp scissors to break up the bud. Remove any seeds, stems, and leaves, and grind up the buds into smaller pieces.






Aim for an even grind. Larger buds burn more slowly, which will cause your joint to burn unevenly, while an excessively fine grind will make rolling more difficult.
Store unused buds inside an airtight container in a cool, dry place.
The amount of marijuana you'll need depends on how large the paper is. Generally, though, ½ a gram is plenty for a single joint. When smoking a joint with friends, you might need up to ¾ of a gram. Blunts take the most, usually between 1-2 grams.
Certain types of grinders have a special compartment to collect kief, which are the trichomes of the cannabis plant. Kief has a higher concentration of THC than of the flowers. Some people choose to sprinkle some kief over the marijuana before rolling for extra potency.

, This is optional, but some people add tobacco, leaf or another herbal smoking mixture to the bud so it can ""breathe"" in the joint. Whatever you use, be sure the consistency is even and that you've broken up or removed any lumps or woody bits.






Cannabis leaf. Cannabis leaf is used a lot in commercial marijuana. Ideally, the leaves are well-cured; if you get ones that came from the top of a flowering female plant, they can be really potent.
Tobacco is a frequent adulterant in joints rolled in Europe; these joints are called ""spliffs."" Some users believe tobacco helps the cannabis burn properly and improves the taste of the smoke. The downside is the risk of unintended nicotine addiction.
Hashish. Hashish comes in many different forms with huge variations in quality. Most contain plant material and binding agents. The best is made by rubbing the sticky resin from flowering-tops, and the worst is full of chemicals. Hash is normally heated with a flame, crumbled into a powder and then mixed with tobacco or herbal smoking mixtures.

Use hashish with care. Some users experience adverse reactions that range from mild anxiety to severe panic. Paranoia is possible and, although rare, acute psychotic reactions can occur.


Resin oil. Genuine resin oil is very hard to come by and is incredibly potent. It comes in the form of a black, brown or transparent oily fluid that gets smeared across the rolling papers or blended into the mix. If you have a membership with a dispensary, you can probably purchase oil contained in syringes.
Kief. As mentioned earlier in the article, kief is a term for the resin glands of the cannabis plant that are rich in THC. Sprinkle some kief, either over the marijuana before rolling, or on the joint after rolling, to give it an extra boost of psychoactive THC.

, This is a piece of index card that's inserted into the end of a marijuana cigarette. It prevents a marijuana cigarette from clogging up, keeps pieces of marijuana from falling out, allows the smoke to flow through, filters out a little tar and stops a marijuana cigarette from dissolving in your mouth when it burns down to the end.






Tear a thin strip from an index card or business card. Fold it three times to make a pleat and roll the rest of the unfolded filter around the folded. It should look like a ""W"" in a circle.
The width of the roach is a matter of personal preference. Wider ones let more smoke through, which produces a rougher smoke, while thinner ones cool the smoke but run a greater risk of clogging. Shoot for somewhere in the middle.
Some smoking shops sell little booklets of ready to use filter tips, which generally consist of little strips of hardened paper neatly cut to size. Alternately, you can buy cellulose filter tips like those used in tobacco cigarettes. These can be found at smoking shops and probably your dispensary.
Although some people refer to the filter tip as a ""roach"", this is incorrect. A roach is the tip of the joint that is left over after smoking. They’re related, but not always the same thing.

, There are several ways to roll a basic joint; the method depicted below is a freestyle roll.


Tear out one of the papers from the booklet and fold it in half lengthwise being sure the side with the glue is up.










Twist one of the bottom corners of the paper. This will be the front.










Place the marijuana inside. Distribute it evenly along the length of the paper to ensure an even burn.










Don't overload it or the joint won't close properly. On the other hand, don't be stingy with the mix or you'll end up with a ""pinner.""
Pick everything up and roll it back and forth until the mix in the rolling paper is evenly dispersed and cylindrical in shape.
Lay the filter down in the center at one end of the joint. Putting the filter in before rolling saves hassle and makes it more likely that you'll get a perfect fit.










Proceed to tuck and roll up the back half of the joint.










Lick the sticky strip of the paper and seal the joint. Lightly twist the end of the joint to keep the contents from falling out.

, Some people prefer to roll the joint 'inside out', where the paper is held upside down with the glued edge held towards you, sticky side down. This technique is generally harder to perform, but will get rid of most of the stingy smoke caused by the burning of excess paper. To roll a joint inside out, simply follow the steps as you would with a normal joint, but when all rolled up, lick the non-gummed rim of paper where you can see the glued edge slightly shine through. Carefully put some pressure on the area where you can see the gummed edge to make the two layers stick. Finally, tear off the excess paper when the paper has dried and twist the end to prevent your contents from falling out."

Hold the cigarette with the filter pointing back toward your body.,
Use matches or a lighter to light the cigarette.,
Inhale and exhale your cigarette.,
Remember to ash your cigarette.",How to Smoke1," In the United States, you must be 18 years old in most states in order to purchase a pack of cigarettes, although some states have different age requirements. In Utah, for example, you must be 19 years old to purchase nicotine products. Always present government issued ID when buying a pack. There are many different kinds of cigarettes, so choose which kind you want carefully.


The two most widely available types of flavored cigarettes are mentholated cigarettes, which have a minty flavor, and clove cigarettes, which are flavored with, unsurprisingly, cloves. In specialty shops, you can find cigarettes with a wider variety of flavors, from chocolate to cherry.
Filtered cigarettes have a filter that reduces the amount of nicotine and tar delivered to the lungs with each inhalation, making them safer to smoke than unfiltered cigarettes. Unfiltered cigarettes are easier to inhale because you don't have to pull through the filter, but if you are new to smoking, you should not start on them, as they might make your throat burn.
Unfiltered cigarettes are also more harmful to health than filtered cigarettes, though all cigarettes are dangerous.
Light and ultra-light cigarettes are deceptively named. Some people believe them to be safer than regular cigarettes, but this is not the case.The main difference between full flavor, light, and ultra-light cigarettes will be taste. If you are new to smoking, you might start on ultra-lights and work your way up to a fuller flavor.;
, Packing your cigarettes condenses the tobacco in each cigarette, making it burn slower and intensifying the flavor. You may have to inhale slightly harder if you pack your cigarettes, so you might skip this step if you have trouble inhaling without coughing.


Turn the pack upside down so the opening from which you remove the cigarettes is facing downward.
Extend your free hand palm up.
Rap the top of the pack down on the fleshy, flat part of your palm three times, hard.
Rotate the pack (still upside down) by 180 degrees.
Repeat the process to make sure cigarettes on both sides of the box are equally packed.

, Cigarettes come with a plastic cover that will have a small pull tab around where the lid flips open. Pull that tab to break the plastic seal. Remove the foil that covers the cigarettes. In the boxes for some brands, such as Camels, both foil tabs pull away, and in other brands, such as Marlboros, only the front tab pulls away.

, This is an optional step, but many smokers flip a single cigarette in the box upside down and designate it as their ""lucky"" cigarette. This is the last cigarette they smoke in the pack. Although there is no rule as to which cigarette should be the lucky, most people who flip a lucky always choose the same cigarette position — for example, the second cigarette from the left in the back row.


Although the cigarette is called a ""lucky,"" in practice, it's an excuse to not give away your last cigarette to friends trying to bum a smoke. Just say ""sorry, this one's my lucky.""

, There are a couple different way to hold a cigarette, so experiment with it until you find a style that feels comfortable and natural for you.


The most common method is to hold the cigarette stable between your index and middle finger. The filter should be between the first knuckles on each finger.
Many people simply hold the cigarette between their thumb and forefinger as though it were a pencil. In this case, the filter should be against the pads of your fingers.

, With the filtered end of the cigarette between your lips, put a flame to the exposed end while inhaling. Inhale deeply two or three times while the flame is touching the exposed end to ensure the cigarette has been properly lit.


After lighting the cigarette, look down at the lit end to make sure the entire end has been lit. If one corner remains unlit, repeat the process.
If the wind blows out your flame, create a shelter with your free hand around the cigarette.
If the wind is so strong that your hand cannot block the wind, turn so that your back is to the wind. Allow your head to block the wind, while keeping your free hand around the flame. People with long hair should be careful, because the wind can blow your hair into the flame.
Because a lighter has a more stable flame, start with a lighter if you're a new smoker.
Matches burn down quickly and might burn your hands if you take too long.

, At first, you'll want to take shallow inhalations, because deep inhalations might result in burning coughing fits. As you get used to smoking, you'll be able to take deeper drags. You should be sucking the smoke into your lungs, not holding it in your mouth. Exhale through your mouth — or your nose if you're feeling fancy.


A good way to tell if you're drawing the breath into your lungs or mouth is to try to exhale through your nose. If no smoke comes out your nose, you're holding the smoke in your mouth.
Don't hold the smoke in your lungs for longer than feels comfortable. This is supposed to be a pleasurable process.
It's fine to smoke your cigarette all the way down to the filter, but don't let the fire actually touch the filter. It smells and tastes awful.

, As the cigarette begins to burn down, it will turn to ash. Tap on the top of the cigarette with your index finger to jar the ash loose from the end of the cigarette and drop it into an ashtray. If you don't remember to ash from time to time, the ash might fall on your clothes or into your food or drink.


You can also tap the end of the cigarette against an object — like an ashtray — to remove the ash.
Cigarette ashes can temporarily smear on your clothes.
Put out your cigarette's flame. When you've finished smoking, make sure you extinguish the flame from the cigarette. In dryer parts of the world, fires could easily be started by lit cigarettes that have been improperly disposed of. There are several methods for putting out a cigarette.
Stubbing out a cigarette means to press it into a flat surface until it stops burning. You can just tamp it multiple times into the ashtray until it stops glowing.
You can also drop it to the ground and grind the flame out with your shoe. Note that this will leave a black charred mark on the ground. Pick up the cigarette and throw it away in a trash can.
If you don't have an ashtray, but don't want to create a large black smear by grinding the cigarette out with your shoe, you can pop the cherry. This means to flick the cigarette until the flaming part at its tip dislodges and fall out of the cigarette. You can grind the cherry out with less smearing this way. Dispose of the cigarette in a trash can.

Use a teapot.,
Hydrate with a steam iron.,
Heat a vacuum sealed jar.",How to Rehydrate Stale Tobacco1," Get a teapot with a tea basket that sit on the top. Add enough boiling water so that it doesn't touch the top basket and ruin the tobacco. Put the tobacco in the basket. Cover the teapot and leave it sit for 30 minutes.


Check the tobacco to see if it is moist enough. Leave the tobacco in longer if it isn’t.;
, Pre-heat a steam iron to the hottest setting. Place a newspaper on a heat resistant surface. Spread your tobacco out onto the newspaper. Use a spray nozzle to spray the tobacco with water once or twice.


Hold the iron above the tobacco and let steam for 10 seconds.
Be careful not to touch the iron to the tobacco.

, Put the tobacco in a clean, stainless steel salad bowl. Wet the tobacco using a spray-bottle, and spray a fine mist over the tobacco 3 - 4 times. Mix up the tobacco with a spoon or spatula. Place the tobacco in a large jar with a vacuum-seal rubber-gasket lid that screws down.

Heat the jar by putting it into an oven set at 200 F (~100 C) for 20 minutes or until jar feels hot to the touch. Let the jar stand for ten minutes.
Remove the jar and let it cool overnight in a cool, dry place. Do not open until the next morning.
Be sure to pack the tobacco down tightly and seal the lid tightly."

, Lick your cigar to make it moist. Take a blade or scissors and cut it lengthwise from butt to tip. With your thumb, slide the insides out. Do it slowly and gently so you don't tear the cigar wrapper.

, Creating this rectangular shape helps to decrease the chances of the wrapper rolling shut prematurely. Separate and use only the innermost layer of the cigar wrap so you'll get less nicotine

, Then fold the wrapper down the center like you would when rolling a regular joint.

, Be generous. You have to use enough mix to support the size of the wrap; otherwise, it'll collapse in on itself while you’re trying to smoke.

, Carefully fold and roll the blunt upward, shaping it as you go. Tuck the shorter side of the wrap around the mix and continue rolling. Be careful not to pinch the ends shut. Lick the remaining paper lengthwise and press down carefully.

, Run the flame of your lighter up and down the length of your blunt in order to “bake” it. Spin the marijuana cigar as you work. Your goal is to darken the color slightly and dry the wrap without setting the blunt on fire.

, Hold the flame to the tip of the blunt. Spin it around to evenly distribute the heat and minimize the chance for developing a run.

When you're finished smoking, put out the cigar.",How to Smoke2," Just like cigarettes and all other nicotine products, you must be 18 in most states in the United States to purchase cigars, so bring your ID with you. There are many different types cigars, and varying quality, so do your research before buying one.Most cigars are corona cigars, which are usually from South America. They're 5.5 to 6 inches long, and have a ring gauge (diameter measured in units of 1/64th of an inch) between 42 and 45.
Panatela cigars are longer and thinner than coronas, and are more popular with women because of their feminine shape.
Lonsdale cigars are 6 to 7 inches long with a ring gauge of 42 to 47. They're a good beginners' cigar.
Churchill cigars (also known as Julie tas) are long and thick, with a length of 7 inches and a ring gauge of 47. These are recommended for more experienced cigar smokers.
Robusto cigars are Cuban, with a length of 5 inches and a ring gauge of 50, and are known for their strength and flavor.
Torpedo cigars are shaped like a torpedo, coming to a point at the end. These cigars take at least an hour to smoke, so should be enjoyed while relaxing for a long period of time.
The shorter and wider a cigar is, the more intense it will be, so beginners should choose a longer, thinner variety to avoid coughing fits.

, Before purchasing the cigar, lightly squeeze it all along its length to make sure there are no particularly hard or soft spots. That would suggest the tobacco has been unevenly packed, and that the cigar would be difficult to smoke. Also check for any discolorations you might find.

, To keep the tobacco from drying out, cigars have a cap on the end that must be removed before you can smoke them.


If you have a cigar cutter, place the tip of the cap-end of the cigar into the cutting hole. Cut it off with one strong, swift chop.
If you don't have a cigar cutter, use sharp scissors or a knife to remove the cap.
Don't use dull blades or apply weak pressure, because that will squeeze down on the cigar and change its shape. This will make it harder and less pleasant to smoke.
Be very careful not to cut yourself when working with any of these sharp-bladed tools.

, Hold the end that will be lit over an open flame for a few seconds, rotating it to make sure that the heat is evenly applied to the cigar. Warming up the cigar in this way will make it easier to light.

, Hold the flame to the tip of the cigar while sucking through the unlit end. Don't inhale the smoke, just draw it into your mouth. Make sure the cigar is fully lit before putting our lighter away.


Blow on the lit end of the cigar to make sure it is fully lit. The air from your breath will make the lit parts glow brighter, and you'll be able to see if there are any unlit spots.

, Unlike cigarettes, you do not inhale cigar smoke into your lungs. You simply pull the smoke into your mouth, where you hold it for a few seconds to enjoy the taste.


Remember that cigars can take an hour or more to smoke, so don't try to speed-smoke it! Set aside a good portion of time to savor the experience.
If you get distracted and don't puff on the cigar from time to time, to risk letting it go out. Make sure to puff every thirty seconds or so to keep it lit.

, Stub the cigar out in an ashtray or on the ground, though note that it will leave a black smudge wherever it is extinguished.


If you didn't smoke much of it and wish to save it for later, don't stub it out. A cigar that's been re-lit after being stubbed out will taste awful. Cut the lit end off with the cigar cutter and let that flame die. The remaining cigar will still have a burnt taste when re-lit, but not nearly as bad as a stubbed out cigar.

Buy a pipe and pipe tamper.,
Buy the right tobacco.,
Pack your pipe.,
Light the pipe.,
Inhale and exhale.,
Put out your pipe.",How to Smoke3," Both of these products can be bought at a tobacconist or online. A tamper is used to pack the tobacco down into the bowl. There are a few things you should consider when making your pipe purchase:Make sure you like the way your pipe looks. Browse through all the options at the tobacconist or online and make sure you buy a product you'll want to use time and again.
Choose a pipe that has a smooth airway from the mouthpiece into the hole, to ensure a smooth smoking experience.
Avoid metal filters in the pipe, as they cause condensation that affects the flavor of the tobacco

, There are many different types of tobacco, and you might get overwhelmed trying to make a decision if you're not familiar with all your options. The best thing you can do is ask a tobacconist for a recommendation — they'll be able to talk you through the process and match you with a tobacco that best suits your tastes. In general though, here are some types of tobacco you might find at a tobacconist:


English and Scottish-style cake tobaccos tend to be spicy and full flavored
American-style flavored tobacco are sometimes flavored with sugars or syrups to change the taste.
Cavendish is a cured tobacco flavored with licorice and vanilla.
Your best bet is to ask a store employee for recommendations, just like you would ask for sommelier for wine recommendations.

, Pour your tobacco into the bowl of the pipe until it is full, then use your tamper to lightly pack it down until it only half-fills the bowl. Repeat that process of filling and tamping until the bowl has been filled with tightly packed tobacco.


Make sure you don't pack it too tightly, or else it will be difficult to draw air through to smoke the pipe. The tobacco should be slightly springy when you press down on it.

, Using a match or lighter, hold the flame over the bowl while gently inhaling through the mouthpiece. Move the flame over the bowl to evenly distribute the heat throughout the tobacco.


After your initial lighting, gently tamp the tobacco again, then repeat the process.

, Like with cigars, pipe smoke is not meant to be inhaled into the lungs, but held in the mouth to enjoy the flavor.


Tamp the tobacco down from time to time to make sure it stayed densely packed in the bowl.
If you feel moisture being sucked back into your mouth through the mouthpiece, insert a pipecleaner for a few moments to dry out the passageway.
If your pipe grows too hot, let it go out and cool down. You can always relight the tobacco.

, When you've finished smoking, you can either put out the smoke by pressing your tamper into the bowl until it is extinguished, or by simply letting the pipe sit unsmoked until it dies on its own.

, Put all the tobacco in a plastic bag. Add a small piece of raw potato. Seal the bag. Check the bag once every hour or every other hour as the tobacco will moisten very quickly., Put all the tobacco in a sealed plastic bag. Add a piece of bread or a half piece for small quantities. Seal the bag and check every few hours for the tobacco to moisten.


The tobacco will become very moist if left overnight.

Use a sealable bag.,
Cover with a cloth.,
Moisten with a sponge.",How to Rehydrate Stale Tobacco3," Spread about half the tobacco evenly over a paper towel. Lightly mist the tobacco with a water-filled spray bottle. Fluff the mixture with your fingers. Repeat until the tobacco is just slightly damp. Mix the moistened tobacco in a plastic bag with the rest of the stale tobacco.Shake the bag to mix thoroughly.
Wait half an hour or so for the moisture to even out.

, Put the tobacco in a bowl (a wider bowl will provide better exposure). Cover the bowl with a damp (not overly wet), clean towel. The towel should not touch the tobacco. Secure the cloth using a rubber band to ensure the cloth doesn’t touch the tobacco.


Check the tobacco every few hours.
This method is less likely to compromise the integrity of your tobacco., Get a new and unused foam sponge and cut off a small corner from it. Use water to dampen the removed sponge. Remove all excess water and make sure it isn’t dripping. Add the damp sponge into a sealable container with the tobacco. The damp sponge will act as a humidifier to the tobacco."

Talk to your doctor about nicotine replacement therapy.",How to Pass a Tobacco Test," While South Carolina is the only state that has outlawed tobacco screens entirelyit's important to know that more than half the states in the United States have provisions in place that prevent employers from establishing hiring practices or incorporating punishment based on your activities outside of work, including tobacco use.If you live in one of the 29 states with these provisions in place, you don't need to submit for a tobacco screen willfully.



Click here for a state-by-state breakdown of tobacco screening laws.;
, ""Tobacco tests"" are usually performed by screening for cotinine, and are usually some combination of mouth swabs, urinalysis, and blood testing.Cotinine is the primary metabolite of nicotine. Nicotine leaves the body in a few hours, but cotinine has a longer half-life, and is usually present for up to a week.


Cotinine has a half-life of 16 hours, meaning that half of all the trace leaves your body every 16 hours, or so. If you're a light smoker, most of it should be gone in 48 hours, depending on how much you smoke, but most tests will pick up trace amounts, especially in the mouth swab.
Cotinine tests screen for smokable as well as smokeless tobacco, including vape pens and other e-cigarettes.

, Depending on how much you smoke, there's no way of knowing how much time you'll need to be all the way in the clear, but with the right combination of techniques, you can be fairly confident that you'll pass if you stop using any kind of nicotine 3-4 days before your test for lighter smokers and 5-7 days for heavier smokers. Read the next section to learn how to quit for a week, or more.


If you smoke in excess of a pack a day, may need to quit smoking farther out ahead of your test. It can't ever hurt to stop earlier, if possible.
If you're a social smoker, or only smoke occasionally, just make sure you quit a few days leading up to the test and you should be fine.

, Any time you've got to pass a urine screen and you're worried about cutting it close, start increasing the amount of fluids you're drinking throughout the day.


Drink plain filtered water. It's good to drink as much as two liters per day, or about half a gallon, to keep your body flushing itself regularly.
Drink warm water with a little bit of lemon in it. To break it up, try warm water with garlic, leeks, or ginger to help your body eliminate fluids.
Drink lots of herbal tea, containing ginger, dandelion root, juniper, which have natural diuretic properties.
Drink lots of natural cranberry juice. Most commercial drinks labelled ""cran"" something or other are really low in actual cranberry juice and high in sugar and apple. If you can, try to get real cranberry juice that's 100% cranberry for the best diuretic effect.

, Go to any head shop and you can find a variety of expensive beverages that all guarantee you can pass any drug or tobacco screen and keep smoking right up to the test. Read the ingredients. These drinks are usually just some combination of fruit juices and electrolytes that you'll pay an arm and a leg for, which won't be any more effective than drinks you can get for free, or for much cheaper. Use some smarts and avoid throwing money away on these drinks.

, If trace amounts show up on your screen, it is possible to blame a smoky bar, a smoky band practice, or other possible second-hand smoke encounters, although this may conflict with prior questionnaire information that you may have filled out in anticipation of the test.


Most cotinine screens are performed in the workplace for insurance purposes. If a trace amount showed up, you can usually get out of it pretty easily with an excuse like this.
If you smoke the day of the test, the amounts will be much higher, though, and you won't be able to blame second-hand smoke for that. You still need to quit, for a few days at least.

, If you know about the test ahead of time, start tapering your usage as much as possible to make it through the week before the test more easily. You'll be taking it easier on your body if you use less tobacco over a period of two weeks, leading up to the test. This will also make your chances of quitting entirely much more likely.Try smoking or using about half the amount of tobacco you normally use, each day, progressively tapering down. Start as soon as you find out about the test.
If you know about the test far enough out, start using the gum or patches as quickly as possible to address the psychological addiction as quickly as possible.

, If you want to smoke, just wait. Don't give in right away. Give it ten minutes, and do something else. It won't be as bad as you think, and the craving may dissipate. At the end of that ten minutes, re-evaluate your craving.


As you work to quit, keep extending that amount of time that you delay each one. The cravings will become more and more manageable, the more you can control them.

, If you're a moderate to heavy user of any type of nicotine, cutting it off abruptly will come with a variety of physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms. Depending on your usage, they may be mild or severe, including symptoms like anxiety, sleeplessness, and headaches.


The first three days will be the worst. You'll likely feel anxious, and probably have a headache, and have some trouble sleeping. Just stay focused on getting through those first three days, and then it'll get easier.
Unfortunately, you won't be able to use nicotine replacements like patches or lozenges during the week leading up to the test, because the test will flag this cotinine in your system. You'll need to be off all nicotine completely leading put to the test.

, If you regularly have a cigarette with a cup of coffee, or during your break at work, identify those situations so you can better anticipate them and prepare for them, possibly avoiding those situations entirely, or finding a suitable replacement. Have a cup of tea instead of coffee, as an experiment for the week, or try jogging on your break.


Replace the habit, if you don't want to replace the trigger. With your cup of coffee, try chewing a cinnamon toothpick, a piece of fennel bulb, or have another healthy snack.Don't be afraid to let yourself indulge in other areas, for the short term, while you're trying to go without nicotine. Have a snack, if you feel like it. Just don't smoke.

, It probably doesn't sound as fun as a smoke, but getting some light to moderate exercise is a great way of making cigarettes seem super unattractive for the time being. You don't have to start running marathons, but taking a week to sweat instead of smoke will help make the cravings less severe.


Start out with 15-20 minutes of light exercise, like stretching or going for a brisk walk. If you feel up to it, move on to something a little more vigorous the next day, like playing basketball, playing soccer, or dialing up a 20-30 minute cardio workout on YouTube.
Exercising will also have the added benefit of workout out any aggression you might be experiencing with withdrawal symptoms, as well as help you to sleep better., You already know smoking is bad, and you don't need another person ragging on your habit. Fair enough. But since you've got to quit for a couple days anyway, a screen like this is usually the perfect opportunity to give quitting a significant shot. What have you got to lose?


Try quitting for the rest of the month, and then reevaluate when the month is up. Are you nuts for a cigarette? Or does it seem less attractive all of a sudden?
If you're trying to get a job somewhere they'll test you regularly for nicotine, that'll be like living in constant fear that the hammer might come down.

, If you relapse, but really want to stay quit after your week-long experience, talk to your doctor about using nicotine replacement to help manage your cravings and stay quit. Prescriptions, including bupropion or varenicline, are available and proven to be effective.Over-the-counter nicotine gum, patches, or other nicotine supplements can also be very effective in helping to cut back or quit entirely.

Continue rolling until you have reached each tip.,
Seal the cigarillo.",How to Roll a Cigarillo1," Using a food scale, weigh-out two-to-three grams of tobacco and place it aside. The exact amount of tobacco required will depend on the size of the wrap and personal preference, but three-grams is the average.Many smokers prefer a slower burning cigarillo. To roll a cigarillo that burns slower, use more tobacco and pack it densely.;
, When cigarillo wraps are packaged at the factory, they are rolled around a soft plastic tube that protects them from any unwanted creasing or folding that can occur during transit. If this is your first attempt rolling a cigarillo, you may want to consider purchasing a couple of wraps since they are delicate and can tear easily.









Cigarillo wraps can be purchased at your local tobacco specialty shop, convenience store, or gas station.
A cigar can be gutted and used as a cigarillo wrap.

, Be sure to place the wrap down so that it's curl faces upward. This curl will help hold the tobacco in place while you roll.


If the wrap lies flat, you can curl it yourself using a pencil or pen.

, Using your thumb, index, and middle fingers, sprinkle the tobacco evenly throughout the wrap. Do your best to make sure that the tobacco is equally distributed, otherwise, the cigarillo may burn unevenly.








Be careful not to overfill the wrap, or you won't be able to seal it properly.

, With both hands, use your index finger and thumb to pick the loaded wrap up by its ends. Once you pick the wrap up, support it from beneath with the fingertips of your thumb, index, and middle fingers. Your palms and thumb should be facing toward you.








, Gently slide your fingertips to the center of the wrap. When you begin rolling, you will start in the middle and finish at the tips.








, Begin with a very small back-and-forth motion--as if you are rubbing your thumb and index fingertips together--and work your way up to a larger roll.








Some tobacco may begin to spill out of the sides. Don't worry.

, Once the tobacco has settled, roll your thumbs down until the cigarillo is being pinched between the tips of your thumbs and the flat surface of your index and middle fingers. Using your thumb tips, roll the edge of the cigarillo wrap over the tobacco and tuck it under the opposite side.








This will take quite a bit of practice.
Be careful not to pinch to hard, or you may crease the wrap.

, Again, begin with a very small back-and-forth motion and work your way to a larger roll. Once ready, use the tips of your thumbs to tuck the edges in.








, At this point, the cigarillo is rolled and is now ready to be sealed.









With practice, your rolling technique will get better and you will be able to produce more consistently rolled cigarillos.

, Lick the inside of the edge that has not been tucked in and then roll it over the top of the cigarillo. Gently apply pressure as the wrap dries and seals.

Refrain from allowing anyone to smoke in your home or car.,
Ask visitors to wash their hands after smoking.,
Stay at smoke-free hotels.,
Use an air purifier.,
Buy air-purifying plants.",How to Reduce Thirdhand Smoke Dangers1," One way to eliminate thirdhand smoke is to get rid of all sources of smoke in your life. Smoke can linger on your clothes and hair even if you don’t smoke in the house, so don’t smoke in your car either.


Don’t allow any visitors to smoke in your home or car. Ask them to step outside if they must smoke.
This includes cigarettes and electronic cigarettes.;
, When you have visitors who smoke, ask them to wash their hands after smoking. They should wash their hands immediately after smoking so as not to spread any contamination. You should ask them to wash their hands again if they want to touch your small children.You may consider asking your visitors to change clothes after smoking so they don’t bring any contaminants into your home.
You can ask your friends with long hair to pull their hair back when smoking to reduce the risk of thirdhand smoke in their hair.

, When you travel, consider staying at smoke-free hotels. Ideally, you should stay in a hotel that has always been smoke-free. Hotels that have been converted to smoke-free facilities may still smell like smoke and have thirdhand smoke in the air or in furniture.If you are visiting a friend who smokes, choose to stay in a hotel instead of the home of a smoker.

, Consider installing a HEPA air cleaner if the home has been lived in by smokers for a long period of time. You should wash the walls, ceilings, carpets, curtains, and blinds before using the air purifier. You should also repaint the walls and replace the carpet. If you try to use an air purifier without the cleaning, painting and replacing, it is not likely that any purifier could handle the load.Ozone air purifiers should only be used when no one is home. The rooms should be well-vented before re-entry. Ozone can destroy some of the odor and purify the air, but ozone is not completely safe either. Make sure to read the directions when using an ozone air purifier and use as directed.
Air filters can cover the lingering smell of smoke, but it does not mean that the thirdhand smoke has been eliminated.

, You can place air-purifying plants around your home to help clean the air. The plants won’t remove particulates, but they can remove various gases and volatile substances. These plants include:Garden mum removes ammonia, benzene, formaldehyde, and xylene.
Spider plants remove formaldehyde and xylene.

Dracaena remove benzene, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, and xylene. Be aware that Dracaena is toxic to pets.
Ficus removes benzene, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene.
Peace lily removes ammonia, benzene, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene.
Boston fern removes formaldehyde and xylene.
Snake plant removes benzene, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, and xylene.
Bamboo palm removes benzene, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene.

Open the hand roller the way you did in step two.",How to Roll a Cigarillo2," If you are using a cigarillo-sized hand roller, you will need approximately two-to-three grams of tobacco. The exact amount will be determined by the size of your wrap and personal preference.

Hand rollers come in several different cigarette, cigarillo, and cigar sizes.
Each of these rollers functions the same way.

, A hand roller has two rolling pins: one that slides and one that remains fixed. To open the hand roller you will need to slide the proper rolling pin to the side.








This will expose the filling chamber.

, Be careful not to use too much or else the rolling pins will jam. Do your best to evenly distribute the tobacco throughout the chamber for a nice and even smoke.







, Slide the rolling pin back to its original position to close the hand roller. Don't worry about any tobacco tips that may be protruding from the rolling pins, these will be pulled in once you begin the rolling process.








, Roll the non-sliding pin downward until it has rotated at least one-full time.








The more times you roll the pin, the thinner and denser--more packed--the cigarillo will be.
Cigarillos that have been over packed may be difficult to draw from.

, If the wrap you are using has an adhesive strip (used to seal the cigarillo), be sure to place the strip at the top and make sure that it faces toward the non-sliding rolling pin.







, Like you did when you were first packing the tobacco, gently rotate the non-sliding rolling pin downward. The cigarillo wrap will be pulled into the hand roller as you roll. Stop rolling when only the very edge of the wrap or adhesive strip is exposed.







, You can lick the wrap directly, or you can moisten your finger and run it along the edge.








, Once you can't see any more of the wrap, go ahead and rotate the rolling pin one full rotation.








Remember to roll the pin that does not slide open.

, Your cigarillo will need a few minutes for it to properly ""stick"" to itself and seal. Once it is dry it is ready to be smoked.









To roll a cigarette, simply use cigarette paper instead of a tobacco leaf or wrap.
If you are rolling a cigarette, you can choose to roll with or without a filter.

Know your nicotine intake.,
Decide on the type of e-cig experience you want.,
Further customize your e-cig.,
Understand the benefits.",How to Quit Smoking with Ecigs1," Physical withdrawals can be avoided by understanding the amount of nicotine in your e-cig compared to your normal cigarette usage. E-cigs use either nicotine cartridges or liquid nicotine. In order to maintain your current nicotine levels, you will need to know the rough equivalents between cigarette and e-cig nicotine amounts.You can always adjust this if you feel like you need more or less, but you should avoid unknowingly using more nicotine than your body is used to. For those who smoke filtered cigarettes, such as Marlboro, Camel, or other readily available brands at a pack a day, make sure you start at about 18 mg of nicotine or 1.8% concentration. This will help stave off any physical withdrawals.
For those who smoke more natural (or unfiltered) brands, like American Spirit or Lucky Strikes at a pack a day or more, 24 mg or 2.4% concentrated liquid nicotine is a good starting point.
If you smoke less than a pack a day and are used to a light cigarette taste, such menthol or cigarettes deemed ""light,"" 12 mg or 1.2% e-cig nicotine liquid is good.;
, Part of the reason that e-cigs make an effective cigarette alternative is that they replicate a cigarette smoking experience, unlike the patch or gum. All e-cigs will be able to give you nicotine, but smoking is a more holistic experience. People become used to the ritual, taste, and feel of smoking. You can choose a e-cig that mimics a cigarette more directly, or choose a more technologically advanced model for a more intense vaping experience.Cigarette replicas are the most popular e-cigs for beginners. These are small, lightweight, and will generally look and feel like a cigarette. These are great for casual smokers who want convenience.
Buy a mid-size model for more vapor and options. These are generally larger and can be about the size of a cigar. They will have a longer battery life, produce more vapor smoke, and have more customizable options. Heavy, long-time smokers, tend to find larger vapor production similar to the experience of a cigarette, and therefore, a better substitute.
Choose an advanced personal vaporizer for advanced options. These require some basic knowledge of vaping and are much more technologically complex; however, they also provide the most customization options, ranging from nicotine levels to the amount of vapor smoke. These will be more complicated, too, and may frustrate first time users.

, You can customize your e-cig experience even more by choosing how much smoke you want your e-cig to produce, length of battery life, and flavors.


Choose a high vapor volume e-cig if you enjoy smoke. Many smokers enjoy the taste and feeling of smoke. Choose a model that produces a high level of vapor if this is something you enjoy about smoking.
Choose long battery life and discrete models to satiate rituals. You might be someone who likes to have a cigarette with friends after dinner, or out at the bar. You can choose a long battery life and e-cig that resembles a cigarette for this. Choosing an e-cig that most resembles your previous smoking habits will make it more likely you stick with it.
E-cigs can also come in flavors. If you are used to smoking menthol cigarettes, or just want a new taste altogether, look into flavored e-cigs.

, Although you shouldn't consider an e-cig a ""healthy"" alternative to smoking, there are some advantages you may notice right away.E-cigs are cheaper. They are not currently taxed like cigarettes and are cheaper to maintain than people who have a pack a day cigarette habit.
You have many more options with e-cigs. You can choose various flavors, nicotine concentrations, or even make choices based on aesthetics.

Find out about your building’s smoking policy.,
Talk about a no-smoking policy in your building.,
Do smoke removal tasks around your home.",How to Reduce Thirdhand Smoke Dangers2," Before you move into your new apartment building or rented home, find out about the smoking policy. If you are living in an apartment, find out if the building is smoke-free or if people can smoke in their apartments.Ask about the previous tenants’ smoking habits. Ask if anyone has smoked in your apartment or home previously.
Find out if there are smoke-free floors or sections in your apartment building.

, Consider discussing your concerns about the smoking policy in your apartment building with your landlord. Ask if they will consider instituting a no-smoking policy in your building. There are many options available to landlords that they can access at the website for the Americans for Non-Smokers’ Rights.If that is not possible, you can ask your landlord to follow the recommendations of the ANR. If your landlord won’t, you can do this instead. You may want to keep receipts and a time-log. You may have legal options to have your landlord pay for the work as well.

, Talk to your landlord about updating your home to remove any thirdhand smoke. If your landlord won’t do that, then do it yourself. The walls and ceilings should be thoroughly washed with detergent and hot water. Gloves should be worn and either disposable towels or many clean rags should be used. Wash the walls, and then rinse at least twice.


Repaint the walls with at least one to two coats of paint.
Replace carpeting. If this is too expensive, shampoo the rugs and carpets at least three to five times using hot water and replacing the cleaning solution often.
Replace the curtains, blinds, and any window treatments.
Clean out ventilation ducts and replace all the filters.

Learn what thirdhand cigarette smoke is.,
Identify who is at risk for thirdhand cigarette smoke.,
Know the dangers of thirdhand smoke.",How to Reduce Thirdhand Smoke Dangers3," Scientific American defines thirdhand smoke as “tobacco smoke contamination that remains after the cigarette has been extinguished.” The contamination from tobacco smoke comes from the hundreds of constituents in tobacco smoke and deposits on walls, ceiling, furniture, clothing, and any object that has come into contact with the tobacco smoke.This contamination lingers long after the cigarette, cigar, or pipe is extinguished.There are over 250 toxins in cigarette and other tobacco smoke and we are only now beginning to learn what happens to those toxins once the smoke has disappeared., Some people are more susceptible to thirdhand cigarette smoke than others. Infants and children are at a significantly higher risk of contamination because they are smaller, breathe more rapidly, and are often physically much closer to contaminated surfaces like the floor.Additionally, infants and children are constantly putting their fingers, their hands, and any and all objects that they can into their mouths.

, Thirdhand smoke has been found to contain ammonia, arsenic, butane, cadmium, chromium, lead, cyanide, toluene, and radioactive polonium. These substances have been associated with cancer, birth defects, and learning disorders in children."

Keep a craving journal.,
Start a plan.,
Reduce temptations.,
Start small and monitor your nicotine intake.,
Reduce nicotine intake gradually.,
Continue smoking the e-cig as long as you need.",How to Quit Smoking with Ecigs2," You will need to zero in on your cravings and triggers in order to get the most out of your e-cig. This will help you use the e-cig to meet non-physical cravings while gradually reducing your body's dependence on nicotine. A week before your purchase, keep a running log of when you smoke, how you feel when you do smoke, and when you particularly crave a cigarette. Some common observations to record may include:How intense was your craving?
What were you doing when the craving came on?
What were you doing?
Who were you with?

, Some people like to go cold turkey and stop smoking altogether; however, it is thought that real advantage of an e-cig is that you can gradually decrease your nicotine intake by progressing to lower and lower strengths of liquid nicotine.Gradually reducing your nicotine intake rather than going cold turkey can lead to fewer withdrawal symptoms.Set goals for quitting and start a timeline.


Set a start date and a day by which you want to be nicotine free. Taper down the strength of e-liquid nicotine based on this timeline.
Reward yourself for meeting goals. Quitting nicotine is really hard! Reward yourself when you meet goals. Go buy something you've been meaning to buy or go out with friends to a new restaurant so others can help you in your journey.

, Get rid of all of your cigarettes or nicotine products. Once you no longer have cigarettes around, you can increasingly rely on your e-cig to help you get through cravings and tough patches while also reducing your nicotine intake.Stop other behaviors that are likely to bring about cravings. For many people this can be drinking alcohol, hanging out in certain settings, and even excessive caffeine that will increase cravings for nicotine.

, There are many reasons why quitting smoking is difficult. Physical addiction to nicotine can cause physical withdrawal symptoms like headaches, nausea, irritability, and even fatigue. An e-cig can be effective because it allows you to gradually decrease the amount of nicotine in your body to avoid some of the brunt of physical withdrawal., Most e-cig companies offer e-cigs with different nicotine concentrations so you can gradually reduce the amount of nicotine without actually having to reduce the amount of e-cigs you use. You can continue to use your e-cig to satiate triggers that make you want to smoke while reducing your body's dependence on nicotine.Most companies offer the following nicotine levels: 3.6%, 2.4%, 1.8%, 1.2%, 0.6%, and 0% nicotine concentration.
If you are heavy smoker and/or smoke unfiltered cigarettes, you will want to make the wean off more gradual. You may want to do this slowly over a period of several weeks (or longer). For example, you might start at 2.4% one week, and the next week go down to 1.8%, and so on.

, The really useful part of an e-cig is that you can actually use a nicotine-free liquid. This way even after your body no longer needs nicotine, you can continue to use the e-cig to satiate the triggers you identified in your journal.


If you are used to smoking while driving, continue to use your e-cig in the car.
Have the e-cig on you during other normal trigger situations. For example, if you crave a cigarette when you are out with friends drinking, having the e-cig on hand can help stave off falling off the wagon.
Use the information from your journal entries to help you prepare for trigger situations. Review what you identified as a trigger and make sure you have your e-cig with you on those occasions or that you have developed other coping mechanisms.

Examine the cigarillo itself for the filter band.,
Peel the wrapper off the cigarillo filter itself.,
Loosen the tobacco wrapper glue on the filter.,
Discard the removed items.",How to Remove a Cigarillo Filter1," This band is where the filter begins and ends so you will know where the tobacco is stored as well.


This band should be a different color than the majority of the cigarillo.;
, It's best to do this with just your thumb and index fingertips.Make sure your fingertips are clean when you start.
Slide the tip of the leaf/paper of the wrapper loose enough to rub and tug on.
If you have trouble starting the peel, try using your fingernails to lift it up.
When you get the peel going, continue around in a steady motion to avoid prematurely tearing the wrapper into smaller pieces.
If you do happen to tear the wrapper into tinier pieces, make sure those bits are discarded where they are not at risk of catching fire.
You may end up loosening some of the tobacco in the tip within the cigarillo.

, Continually rub and twist the wrapper around the filter until it comes off.You can decide now how much of the filter you actually want to take off.
The filter will be an exposed paper or cotton-based fiber combination filling the tip.
The more of the filter that stays on, the better for your health., Dispose of the filter and excess material.


Ensure no flammable items are carelessly left about.
Sweep clear any excess tobacco and/or store it for re-use if that's what you intend.

Open your can first to check for freshness.,
Pinch the can between your middle finger and thumb.,
Snap the tin downward quickly.,
Open the tin.",How to Pack Tobacco1," Most dipping tobacco comes in small, hockey puck-shaped tins that are designed to keep the tobacco nice and moist, and the flavor strong. Chewers and dippers will ""pack"" the tobacco to one side of the can for a variety of different reasons, but mostly to push all the tobacco to the same place in the tin, making it easier to get a pinch, and because it looks cool.


Packing smokeless tobacco does nothing to keep the tobacco ""fresher,"" and it's perfectly fine if you don't want to pack it. Packing the tin is mostly a ritual, though it does help to consolidate the tobacco in the tin and makes it easier to tell how much you've got left.;
, After closing the tin, put the tip of your thumb in the center of the bottom of the tin, and the tip of your middle finger in the center of the top of the tin. Rotate the tin so it's perpendicular to the ground.

, Hold the tin loosely, but firm enough that you won't drop it. Wrap your pointer finger around the edge of the tin, as if you were going to skip it on the water, like a stone. While relaxing your pointer finger over the can, move the can up and down quickly.


Start at about shoulder height and move the can downward with a quick jerk. With each jerking movement, your pointer finger will make a pleasing snap noise on the side of the can. Repeat several times to get a good pack.
Some dippers will do a slightly different version, snapping it backward, toward the side of the head, as opposed to downward. Others will flick the tin away from them, like throwing a frisbee. Experiment some to see what feels most comfortable for you.

, The loose tobacco should be packed densely to one side of the tin, making it easy to remove a pinch, no matter how little is left inside. Then, you're ready to dip and enjoy.

Break up your tobacco.,
Soak the tobacco.,
Add honey or molasses.,
Add a tiny bit of water to help mix everything together.,
Cut the apples into fourths and remove the core from each piece.,
Put the apple pieces into a food processor or cut into very small pieces.,
Heat the apples briefly in a saucepan to remove any moisture.,
Cool the apple mix and add glycerin.,
Mix the apples with the tobacco mixture.,
Bake the Shisha.,
Add any extra flavorings.,
Store your Shisha overnight.,
Check the shisha and enjoy.",How to Make Apple Shisha," The first thing you need to do to make your own apple shisha is to prepare the tobacco by breaking it up into strips. The tobacco serves as the base ingredient that holds everything together. As well as the main ingredient for smoking.
American Spirit loose tobacco works well, but you should feel free to try any type of loose leaf tobacco to get the flavor you want. Cheaper loose leaf pouches like Drum also work. Pipe tobacco can also be used for a more smokey flavor, but will be harsher than regular tobacco.
Make sure your tobacco has dried out before preparing it. If it is moist, expose it to open air to let it dry out for a few hours or overnight.
Once dry, break up any large pieces of tobacco in a Tupperware dish. Take out any spines that may be present on larger leaves. Then, you may want to chop the leaves with a knife if you have whole leaf tobacco.;
, Once the leaves are chopped and broken up into smaller bits, you need to soak the tobacco.


Soaking the tobacco makes it pliable and removes some of the nicotine and takes out some of the harsher tobacco flavors.
The longer you soak the tobacco the less flavor you will taste. Less tobacco flavor allows you to taste more of the apple.
Pour cool water into your Tupperware. Use enough water so that you can mash the tobacco down under the water level. Mash the tobacco down so it really soaks. Soak the tobacco for at least 30 minutes. If you soak longer than 30 minutes, change the water. The water will turn brown from the tobacco and nicotine. Alternatively, you can boil your tobacco, then rinse it several times with cool water. , Once you have soaked the tobacco to your liking, strain it to remove the water. Let the tobacco dry a bit. Then add either honey or molasses.


Before adding your honey or molasses you will want to let the tobacco dry somewhat. Mash it up into a ball and squeeze any moisture out. Like you would if you were wringing out a wet rag.
Honey and molasses are fairly similar but will yield slightly different results. Honey won’t flavor the shisha quite as strongly as molasses will.
Whichever you choose, you want to use a honey or molasses that aren't very expensive. If using molasses, make sure it is not sulfured. If using honey, less expensive honey is better because most of the flavor will get lost in the process.
It’s easiest to use honey or molasses that are more raw which you can spoon out onto your tobacco. Spoon the honey or molasses over your tobacco. The ratio should be roughly 3 to 1. For every three grams of tobacco, use one gram of honey or molasses. However, the amount is up to your preference.

, You may want to splash a bit of water over the honey or molasses so it’s easier to mix with your hands.


You can also purchase extra flavoring oils to add to your shisha if you like. Flavorings made by LorAnn can add more of a fruity taste to your shisha. Always use high-quality flavorings. While these are often called flavoring oils, you don’t want something with actual oil in it. The oil will separate all your ingredients.
Mix the ingredients until your tobacco has a nice sticky texture. keep adding your honey or molasses as needed until you get the consistency you’re used to from store bought shisha.

, Before adding the apples to your tobacco, you have to remove the core and any seeds before blending the apples. You can prepare your apples while you’re soaking the tobacco.
Cut the apples into fourths and make sure that you remove the core, seeds, and the stem.

, Be careful that you don’t chop or cut the apples into even pieces.


A food processor is best because it will give you a nice consistency that is in-between apple sauce and apple chunks.

, Let the apples simmer on a medium low heat.


Cooking the apple mix will remove moisture. You don’t want a lot of water in your apples because the moisture will make it harder for the shisha to burn.
The amount of time you heat the apples is somewhat subjective. You don’t want to burn the apples so keep an eye on the pan.

, Glycerol is an organic compound sometimes called glycerin or glycerine. Glycerin is used to absorb any water from your ingredients. The glycerin will help to bind your apple mixture with your tobacco mixture. But it will also reduce the chance of your shisha burning quickly and unevenly.
Glycerine can even increase smoke production as it creates puffy white clouds when vaporized.
While glycerine can produce smoke, add a bit of sugary flavor, and act as a preservative, it isn’t necessary to use in your shisha. However, many shisha brands use it so the shisha lasts longer and it can help you get your apple shisha to a good consistency.
You’ll want to use vegetable glycerine or glycerine made for shisha.

, After your apple mixture has cooled down, mix it with your tobacco mixture.


You’ll want to use a fork or your hands to toss the ingredients together so that the apple and tobacco are mixed evenly.
If the mixture seems dry, add a little more honey, molasses, or glycerine. You want the consistency to be sticky and moist.
Once you’ve mixed the ingredients together, ball it up. Then lay out a piece of tin foil large enough to cover and wrap your shisha in. Place the shisha on the foil, and mold it together into a solid, well-packed brick. Then wrap the foil around it. This will keep the juices in while you bake the shisha.

, Put the package of tin foil in an oven safe tray or pan in case the juices leak. Then place the shisha in your oven.


You will want to bake the shisha at the lowest possible temperature. About 180-degrees is best. If your oven’s lowest temperature is 200-degrees that’s ok, you’ll just have to monitor the shisha more closely.
If you can’t go as low as 180-degrees, you may want to open the door intermittently to lower the temperature.
Bake the shisha for around 45 minutes to one hour. This will allow the juices to break down and really mix into your shisha.

, Once you have baked the shisha, the honey or molasses, will have liquefied. However, you may want to add a bit more if the shisha seems a little dry.


Before adding any extra flavoring, make sure you let your shisha cool down while still wrapped in the foil.
You can also play around with adding extra flavors like vanilla extract if you wish.
Depending on how you prefer your shisha and what consistency you like, you may want to play around with when you add ingredients. If you feel that you lose the apple flavor from baking the apple mixture with the tobacco mix, try adding it in after you bake.
Additionally, some people prefer to add glycerin and additional flavoring only after baking.

, Once the shisha has baked, cooled, and you have mixed in any extra flavors or ingredients, you should store it.


Store the shisha in an airtight container in your fridge. Storing overnight or longer will allow all the ingredients to fully mix together and blend. Once everything has had a chance to truly blend you’ll get the best smoke.

, After you’ve let it sit and cure for at least a night, take it out of the container and check the consistency. If the shisha is to your liking, you can pack a bowl and enjoy.


After you let it sit, you want to make sure that the shisha hasn’t dried out too much. If you added enough honey, molasses, and glycerin, it should be preserved. If it seems a little dry, add a bit more, mix, and enjoy.

There is a risk with scissors in that you will over-torque or twist when cutting and ruin the cigarillo that way.

, Again, this should be on one tip and alternately colored from the rest of the cigarillo.


Try to decide beforehand if you want all or some of the filter to be removed.
The cutting method does increase risk of damage to the filter and cigarillo.

, Be careful not to cut beyond the filter's edge into the main part of the cigarillo.


Slide the cigarillo tip into the scissor blade while it's steadied on a flat surface such as a table.
Snip slowly and evenly, avoid any twisting motions.

Use the punch/bullet cutter for most cases.,
Operate the v-cut.,
Cut with the straight version.",How to Remove a Cigarillo Filter4," If you have a tipped cigarillo, though they are not common, you will likely need a cutter.There are three major varieties of cutters--punch/bullet cuts, v-cuts, and straight or ""guillotine"" cuts. The punch/bullet cutter is the easiest cutter to use. Insert the cigarillo's tip into the opening, push and twist the blade, and then pull it out.

, This is not the best cutter to use since it only notches into the tip and can result in an uneven burn, but it is an option. And if you are removing the filter, this may be insufficient.Insert the cigarillo tip into the v-slot double bladed area.
Extend and then squeeze the ends of the cutter to snip the end.
Pull back the sliced tip and discard.

Pack cigarettes before opening them.,
Turn the pack upside down in your hand.,
Slap the top of the pack into your palm.,
Open the pack of cigarettes and remove one.",How to Pack Tobacco2," When you buy a pack of cigarettes, whatever variety, the pack will have been sitting right-side-up on the shelf for quite a while, and the tobacco will have loosened up some in the paper. Many smokers will pack the tobacco back down toward the filter while the cigarettes are still tight in the package, making each one somewhat easier to light and draw from.


While it's not necessary to pack cigarettes, it is true that cigarettes from packs that haven't been packed have a tendency to ""kick the cherry,"" or lose the lit-end when the ash is tapped off.
It's also true that the tobacco will recess some, back into the cigarette, leaving a little empty tab of paper on the end of each one, which is somewhat easier to light than a cigarette with tobacco flush with the end.

, Pinch the between your thumb and middle finger in your dominant hand, the top of the pack pointed down toward the floor. Hold the pack in place with your pointer-finger on top. Hold your other hand open flat, your palm pointed up.


You don't have to remove the plastic wrap from the outside of the pack first, and in fact it's better if you don't. You don't have to worry about the top of the box flapping open while you're doing it.
Soft-packs and hard-packs are done in exactly the same way, as are filtered cigarettes and unfiltered, but it's a good idea to handle soft-packs a bit more gently, since there's nothing separating your finger from the cigarette but a thin piece of paper.

, To pack the cigarettes, bring the top of the pack down firmly into your open palm, slapping it. Hold the pack loose enough so you're not bruising your palm, just letting the momentum of the swing carry the pack into your palm.


Bring it back up and repeat this process about 10 times, depending on how packed you like your cigarettes. More packing will recess the tobacco farther into the paper, resulting in more empty space at the tip of the cigarette and denser tobacco, making the draw somewhat more snug.

, If you don't like how far you've packed the tobacco, you can return the cigarette to the pack and pack it a few more times. If you packed it too much, you can flip the pack over and pack it a few times in the opposite direction, if you wish.

"

Only pack a clean, well-maintained tobacco pipe.,
Fill the bowl with the tobacco of your choice and push it down by half.,
Add another few pinches to fill the bowl.,
Light the tobacco and draw gently.,
Ask a tobacconist to demonstrate, if your pipes go out frequently.",How to Pack Tobacco3," In between using a tobacco pipe, the pipe should be allowed to cool thoroughly, and the stem should be cleaned out by running a pipe cleaner through it several times. It's ok, and in fact it's a good thing if the bowl of the pipe is dark and ashy. That's called the ""cake"" and it helps the tobacco burn in a uniform way.


Never empty a tobacco pipe and immediately repack it. The stem will likely be full of wet condensation, which will give you a hot and rattling smoke that won't taste very good.

, The best and most simple way to pack a pipe is to fill the bowl completely, then use the pipe tamper–a small metal rod with a flat end made for the purpose–to push the tobacco down until it's reduced by about half.


If you don't have a tamper, it's perfectly fine to use your thumb, your forefinger, or the blunt end of a lighter. The tamper is nice, but not necessary.

, Refill the pipe to full and compress the tobacco again by half. The pipe should be roughly 3/4 of the way full, depending on the variety of the tobacco and the springiness of it. If you've got a larger bowl, you might want to add more, but that's probably enough to get started., After packing it in, you're ready to heat up the pipe and get smoking. Draw gently and rhythmically to avoid overheating the pipe or flustering the tobacco.

, Packing a pipe is an art form that will take some practice, but it also doesn't need to be any more complicated than you want it to be. You don't need fancy equipment or expensive tobacco to pack a good pipe. If your pipes are going out frequently, though, you might have a malfunction in your pipe stem, or you might be packing the pipe too loosely. Experiment some, and ask a tobacconist for help if you're struggling.

Practice relaxing your pointer finger.,
Hold the can of Skoal between your middle fingers and your thumb.,
Tap the side of the can with your pointer finger.,
Tap the top of the can with your pointer finger.",How to Pack Skoal1," This method requires you to slap your pointer finger against the side of the Skoal tobacco can or the top of the Skoal tobacco can to pack the tobacco together. To do this method, you will first need hold your hand so it is sideways and your palm is facing you. You will then need to practice relaxing your pointer finger so it hangs loose.Keeping your pointer finger loose and relaxed, you should try to slap your pointer finger against your middle finger, making a quick slapping up and down motion.
This may take practice but be patient. Over time, your pointer finger will relax and make a slapping noise as it hits your middle finger.;
, Once you start to get the hang of relaxing your pointer finger so it slaps against your middle finger, you can do this same motion on the can of Skoal.Start by placing your middle finger and ring finger on top of your thumb. This will look a little like you are making bull’s horns with your fingers. Then, place the can of Skoal, lid on tight, between your middle fingers and your thumb. The can should be turned on it’s side, with the lid facing towards you.
You can rest all three fingers on the side of the can, with your pointer finger relaxed and loose on the side of the can.

, With a tight grip on the side of the can, shake the can, keeping your wrist loose. Use your pointer finger to tap the side of the can. This is the same motion you practiced earlier, where your pointer finger slapped against your middle finger. Tapping the side of the can with your pointer finger a few times, making a slapping sound, should pack the Skoal nicely.Tap the can five to eight times before you plan to chew.

, Another option is to hold the can of Skoal so the lid is facing the ceiling, rather than facing you. Grip the can between your thumb and middle finger. Then, shake the can with a loose wrist and tap the top of the can with your pointer finger several times in a quick up and down motion.This option should also pack the Skoal nicely. Make sure you screw the lid of the Skoal on tight before trying this option, as you do not want to get tobacco everywhere.
Tap the can five to eight times before you plan to chew.

Hit the can of Skoal against the palm of your hand.",How to Pack Skoal2," Grip the can of Skoal in one hand so it is turned on it’s side. Hold it so your fingers have a strong grip on the lid of the can and your pointer finger is curled on the side of the can.This method is often done by chewers who have not mastered the pointer finger slap method of packing. Though it may not get you as tight of a pack as the pointer finger method, it is sufficient for the occasional chewer.

, Keep your palm flat, as this will act as the flat surface you are going to use to pat down the tobacco in the can., Grip the can tightly and firmly hit the can against the middle of your palm, keeping your wrist loose. The side of the can should tap against your palm and you should hear the tobacco pack together in the can.Make sure you tap the can five to eight times before you plan to chew for a nice, tightly packed chew.

Collect your supplies.,
Line the inside of both tubes with aluminum foil.,
Using foil, secure the funnel to one end of the paper towel tube.,
Cinch the bag around the funnel nozzle and set it with twist ties.,
Assemble the vaporizer.,
Get vaporizing.",How to Make a Vaporizer from Household Supplies1," While you may have to buy a heat gun to complete this method, it's still more cost effective than buying a $100-$200 vaporizer. A heat gun like this costs around $40 and the rest of the supplies you probably have around your house, or can get at the grocery store for less than 5 bucks. For this method, you'll need:


a heat gun that heats to at least 200 degrees C
paper towel and toilet paper tubes of the same diameter
aluminum foil
an oven bag, also known as a turkey bag
a tea ball
twist ties
a funnel or coffee percolator small enough to nest in the paper towel tube;
, It might help to roll the foil around a pen or a ruler, insert it into the tube, and then unroll the foil when it's on the inside. Leave enough of a lip on the foil (about an inch or so) to wrap around the outside edge of the tube and secure it.


Opinions vary among smokers regarding whether or not heated aluminum foil is actually safe, or whether it gives off harmful vapors of its own. Some studies suggest that aluminum poisoning contributes to Alzheimer's disease, though this method typically won't scorch and melt any aluminum. If you want to vaporize for health reasons, keep this in mind.

, You'll want the funnel to point outward. To make sure it creates a tight seal, you might consider using some duct tape or glue before securing it with foil.

, Fix the open mouth of the oven bag over the nozzle and wrap some twist ties around it securely. Then, fold the edges of the bag up over the ties and secure them again with another tie. Here, you're just creating a folded edge to make sure the bag nestles snugly against the nozzle.


The bag will collect the vapor as you heat it. You can pass the bag around, so it might also be smart to have something to plug the hole in the bag with. Or you can just use your thumb.

, Now you've got a bunch of strange-looking devices covered with tinfoil, but it'll come together very easily. Aiming the heat gun straight up in the air, put the toilet paper tube over the heat nozzle. Put what you want to smoke into the tea ball and rest it on the top of that tube.Next, fix the other paper towel tube over that, with the percolator or funnel pointing up. You might fit them together with some extra foil to make sure they fit together snugly. Fix the bag on top of the funnel, and you're ready to go.

, Switch the heat gun on and watch the bag slowly inflate with vapor. It may be somewhat difficult to see, but you can trust that it'll be there. When the bag fully inflates, switch off the heatgun and inhale any vapor remaining in the long tube (there may be a considerable amount--don't waste it). Take turns inhaling the vapor from the oven bag.

Collect your supplies.,
Light the candle and place it inside the box.,
Place the tray on top of the flame, resting on the edges of the box.,
Put the glass over the tin.,
Snake your tube up into the glass and inhale.",How to Make a Vaporizer from Household Supplies2," This is the easiest and most primitive method, requiring the fewest and most common supplies. You'll need:


a small box
a small tea candle that fits inside the box
a small metal tray that can rest on top of the box, possibly the lid from a candle or the top to a tin of hand cream
a glass big enough to cover the metal tray
a small rubber tube or bendy straw

, Light it. Make sure it's spaced in the middle of the box to avoid catching anything on fire.


Basically, you're going to heat what you're planning on smoking on the tray with the candle and use the glass to collect the vapor, which you'll inhale through the tube. It's a simple method.

, It helps to have the flame low enough so that it won't scorch the tin too badly. Put whatever you plan on smoking on top of the tin lid.

, Find a good-sized glass big enough to fit over your tin and small enough to rest on the edges of your box. Wait for the glass to fill with vapor.

, When you see the glass begin to fill with vapor, you can start inhaling through the rubber tube. When you're finished, you can take this apart easily and no one will know the difference.

Collect your supplies.,
Put two holes into the bottle cap, and put the straw through one of them.,
Cut off the neck off the bottle using your scissors.,
Remove the bottom of the lightbulb.,
Tape or glue the bottle neck to the hole in the bulb.,
Screw the cap on the bottle end.,
Smoke.",How to Make a Vaporizer from Household Supplies3," For this method, you'll need:


a lightbulb
a plastic straw
a plastic soda bottle, 12 oz
a knife or scissors
a pen
some tape or glue

, Think of them less as ""holes"" and more as slits big enough to push the straw through. You need to make sure the hole will be air-tight. If it´s not, roll some tape around the sides of the straw. Leave the other hole open.

, Leave yourself at least 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2 cm) of the neck of the bottle. You'll use this to attach to the light bulb, which will act as the vaporization chamber.


If you're concerned about BPA-related issues with smoking out of plastic, you can substitute any type of non-plastic tube into the bulb that fits. The stem of a small metal flashlight might work nicely.

, You'll need a sharp knife to carefully work around the ""screw-in"" end of the light bulb. Usually the groove used to screw in the bulb is a good place to cut. Be very careful.When you've removed the end, you might need to pull the rest of the metal off using pliers. It's soft metal and should tear easily. When you've removed the metal, extract the filament and interior components of the lightbulb, leaving you with an empty glass chamber.

, A typical soda bottle and a regular household lightbulb should have roughly the same size of stem, so it should fit almost perfectly. Using plenty of duct or masking tape, fix them together so that they create an airtight seal.

, After you've put whatever you plan on smoking into the lightbulb, screw your cap on. Feel around to make sure all the contact points are well sealed. Add some tape or a dab of glue if necessary.

, To smoke, cover the empty hole in the cap with one finger and suck through the straw as you gently heat the lightbulb with a torch lighter, rotating it to avoid scorching.


When the heat starts to release the vapors, you'll see not smoke exactly, but a kind of misty haze start to form in the bulb. Uncover the hole on the cap with your finger and breathe in through the straw.
Opinions vary about whether or not heating lightbulbs in this way is safe. Some bulbs have plastic liners the vapors of which would be dangerous to breathe, more dangerous than the carcinogens related to smoking plant matter. If you're going to use a lightbulb, make sure it's clean, clear glass, and change it out regularly.

The risk of prostate cancer increases the older you get. Although approximately 75% of the cases of prostate cancer have no pattern or order, about 20% of those with prostate cancer have had cases of the disease in their family previously. There are also approximately 5% of cases that are hereditary.


More than 80% of prostate cancers are diagnosed in men over the age of 65.
If you have a first-degree relative, which would be a father, brother, or son, with prostate cancer, your risk of developing prostate cancer is two to three times higher than the average risk.If you have BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations, you are more likely to develop prostate cancer. Your doctor can test to see if you carry these genes.
There may be a correlation between prostate cancer, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio.This means carrying fat around your waist may increase your chances of developing prostate cancer.;
, If you are African-American, the risk of prostate cancer is 60% higher than if you are Caucasian. African-American males are also twice as likely to die from prostate cancer and develop prostate cancer at an earlier age than Caucasian males., The hormones that your body naturally produce can contribute to the development of prostate cancer. Testosterone is a male sex hormone that is responsible for the deep voice, increased muscle mass, and strong bones that are prevalent in males. It is also responsible for the male sex drive and sexual performance and contributes to aggression. The growth of prostate cells is stimulated when testosterone is naturally converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). According to studies, excess levels of DHT have been implicated in the development of prostate cancer.Another hormone implicated in the development of prostate cancer is excessive levels of insulin growth-like factor 1 (IGF-1).There is a modest increase in prostate cancer in men who have the high levels of IGF-1.

, There are some symptoms that you can look for that might be caused by prostate cancer. See your doctor if you experience symptoms such as frequent urination, especially at night, weak or interrupted flow of urine, difficulty urinating or straining to start the urine stream, inability to urinate, pain or burning while urinating, blood in the urine or semen, difficulty having an erection, or nagging pain in the back, hips, or pelvis.


These symptoms don’t necessarily mean that you have prostate cancer, but you should see your doctor to get tested for it or other issues.

, One of the best ways to start to reduce your risk of prostate cancer is see your doctor. Your doctor can screen you for prostate cancer with a DRE. During a DRE, a doctor inserts a gloved finger into the rectum and feels the surface of the prostate for any irregularities.


Men of average risk for prostate cancer should be screened beginning at age 50. African-American men and men with a family history of a first-degree relative being diagnosed with prostate cancer before age 65 should begin screening at age 40 or 45., The PSA test requires the doctor to take your blood and check the antigen levels in your system. Depending on your levels during your first test, the doctor may suggest different periods between testing. The higher your level of PSA, the more frequently you need to be tested. If you are found to have an extremely high PSA, your doctor will run more tests to see if your have prostate cancer.According to the American Cancer Society, if your PSA is higher than 2.5 ng.mL, you should be retested every year. If your PSA is lower than 2.5 ng/mL, you may only need to be retested every two years.If your PSA is between 4-10 ng/mL, there is a one in four chance that you will have prostate cancer. If it is higher than 10 ng/ml, your chance of having prostate cancer rises to over 50%.Abnormalities uncovered by the DRE or the PSA test can be further investigated with a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and a biopsy if necessary., Your doctor can also prescribe medications that have the proven ability to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. In clinical trials, the drugs Avodart and Proscar reduced the risk of prostate cancer.Currently, these drugs are only approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate gland.


As a result, these drugs have been used off-label for the prevention of prostate cancer, which means they are not approved for the prevention of prostate cancer by the FDA., One great way to possibly reduce the risk of prostate cancer is to exercise. Some studies even indicate that your risk of cancer decreases further the more vigorous you exercise.You should do aerobic exercise at least 30 minutes per day for 5-6 days out of the week. Aerobic exercise is the best type of exercise for disease prevention because it has all sorts of health benefits, including improved circulation, a healthier immune system, and increased energy levels.
Try aerobic exercise such as biking, swimming, running, dancing, spinning, and rowing. You should also make an effort to become more physically active in your day-to-day life. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, park your car further away from work, or use a standing desk instead of a seated one.
In one study, men who participated in vigorous aerobic activity for at least 3 hours per week had a 61% lower risk of death from prostate cancer., Men with a healthy body weight as defined by body mass index (BMI) have a reduced risk of developing prostate cancer when compared to men considered to be obese.Body mass index is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. BMI ranges are categorized in numbers, where underweight BMI is less than 18.5, normal weight BMI is 18.5 to 24.9, overweight BMI is 25 to 29.9, and obese BMI is 30 or higher.


To figure out your BMI, multiply your height in inches by itself. Then, take your weight in pounds and divide it by the number you got from your height. Then, take that number and multiply it by 703.Consult with your doctor to come up with a healthy diet plan to ensure that you lose weight at a healthy, yet effective rate.

, Another way that you can reduce your risk of prostate cancer is to have more sex. According to an Australian study, if you masturbate five or more times per week, you are 34% less likely to develop prostate cancer by age 70. Along the same lines, sex also counts toward the total number of weekly ejaculations.


The finding could be explained by the flushing out of cancer-causing agents during ejaculation., You can reduce your risk of prostate cancer by making dietary changes. In order to help lower your chance of getting prostate cancer, you should eat a diet that is low in fat. According to numerous studies, there is an established link between a diet high in saturated fat and the development of prostate cancer.In general, fats should not exceed 30% of total daily caloric intake. Saturated fats should also not exceed 20% of your daily intake and the combination of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats should not exceed 10% of your total daily caloric intake., If you are trying to cut down on fat, a way to help this is to eat less red meat and dairy. In addition to this, if you reduce or eliminate your consumption of red meat, dairy, and eggs, you will have a decreased risk of prostate cancer.


Red meat is a significant source of saturated fat in the diet. Red meat also increases levels of IGF-1, which is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer.
A general rule of thumb is to limit each protein serving to 3 ounces with a maximum of 6 ounces per day.Red meat, dairy, and eggs also increase levels of choline, which is also associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer.
Dairy can be a significant source of saturated fat, as well as calcium, in the diet. Excessive intake of calcium may also increase a man’s chances of developing prostate cancer.You can reduce your calcium intake by cutting down on or even eliminating dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt. Choose soy-based alternatives instead.

, Increasing the consumption of soy products is another dietary option to consider to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. Soy products contain isoflavones, which are natural compounds that act like estrogens. In laboratory tests, they have been proven to inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells.


Try to incorporate soy products such as soymilk, tempeh, miso, and tofu into your diet.
In American Adventist men, high levels of consumption of soymilk, which provided them with about 90 mg of isoflavones a day, created a 70% reduction in prostate cancer risk.
All traditional soy-containing foods provide 30-40 mg of isoflavones per serving.
Other sources of isoflavones include peanuts and legumes such as chickpeas, lentils, and kidney beans., Eating more fruits and vegetables may work to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. Eat vegetables such as tomatoes because they contain lycopene. This substance is abundant in cooked tomatoes and has been found to reduce the total risk of prostate cancer by 35% and the risk of advanced prostate cancer by 50%. Onions, garlic, leeks, shallots, scallions, and chives contain oregano-sulfur compounds, which are associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer.


You should also eat vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli, kale, brussel sprouts, cauliflower, and horseradish because they contain compounds which lower prostate cancer risk., You should consider increasing your intake of fatty fish. Fish, which is full of omega-3 fatty acids, may lower prostate cancer risk. Try new recipes that include tuna, salmon, trout, herring, and sardines.


If you don’t like fish, you can add omega-3 fatty acids to your diet with flaxseed.Flaxseed can be bought whole, crushed, or milled to add to your diet.

, You should consider drinking red wine to help reduce your risk of prostate cancer. The skins of red grapes contain high levels of resveratrol, an antioxidant which may help inhibit the growth of prostate cancer.Although it is good for you, red wine should be consumed in moderation. You should drink no more than two glasses, or 10 ounces, of red wine per day.Drinking more than the recommendation of 10 ounces per day may negate the beneficial effects., Drinking green tea may also reduce the risk of prostate cancer. Brewed green tea contains high levels of polyphenol compounds, particularly catechins, that may be protective against prostate cancer. Try to brew yourself a cup with breakfast or lunch to help lower your risk of cancer.


Unfortunately, the caffeine found in green tea may limit its intake due to side effects such as trouble sleeping, headache, heart palpitations, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.Black tea contains much lower concentrations of polyphenols and catechins than green tea.

, You should be mindful about supplementing with vitamins and minerals. Selenium and vitamin E supplements may double your risk of prostate cancer, especially if you have low levels of selenium to begin with., There are some supplements that will naturally help you fight prostate cancer. Naturally occurring folate, a B vitamin, has been shown to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. You should not take folic acid, which is a synthetic form of folate, because it has been found to increase the risk of prostate cancer.You should also try to maintain an adequate level of zinc. While there is conflicting evidence, zinc is considered protective against prostate cancer, while zinc deficiency or an excess of zinc may promote the development of prostate cancer.A study done at the National Institutes of Health revealed no association between multivitamin use and the risk of prostate cancer., You can also explore herbal options to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. In a laboratory test, the herbal mixture of ginger, oregano, rosemary, and green tea sold under the brand name Zyflamend reduced the growth of prostate cancer cells by 78%. Another herbal option is FBL 101, which is a blend of soy, black cohosh, Dong Quai, licorice, and red clover, helped reduce the risk of prostate cancer.


Scientists at the National Cancer Institute administered FBL 101 to mice with prostate cancer and found that it decreased the growth of prostate cancer.The dosage of Zyflamend is 2 soft-gels daily with food. You should consult your doctor before using the herbal blends in Zyflamend or FBL 101.

Establish a regular washing routine.,
Rinse with warm or room temperature water.,
Use a volumizing styling product.,
Avoid products that stiffen the hair.,
Be sure to use volumizing styling products regularly.,
Use a blow dryer after application of volumizing styling products.",How to Add Volume to Hair (for Men)1," Many men think that regular washing of their hair will lead to increased hair loss or will increase the appearance of thinning hair. However, the opposite is true. Greasy or unwashed hair tends to clump together, leaving areas of the scalp exposed to a greater degree. Find a hair washing regimen that seems to maximize the appearance of volume and stick to it. A number of volumizing shampoos and conditioners will coat the hair follicle with a special polymer designed to increase the appearance of volume and can be used in your regular washing routine. Before deciding on a post-shower hair treatment, be sure to try shampoos and conditioners that are specifically designed to increase volume.To achieve the best results, try pairing a volumizing shampoo with a volumizing conditioner. Suggested combinations can often be found on the label of volumizing products.
Volumizing shampoos and conditioners do not actually add volume, but rather the appearance of volume. You should notice a difference in the appearance of volume of your hair directly after using these products, drying, and styling your hair.;
, Never rinse shampoos and conditioners out of your hair with hot water. Hot water can damage your hair follicles and exacerbate the appearance of thinning hair. Warm or room temperature water is ideal for washing volumizing shampoos and conditioners out of your hair., A wide variety of waxes, sprays, mousses, gels and other topical styling products claim to increase the appearance of volume in a man’s hair. However, these products are not uniformly effective for each individual. Try to identify where and why your hair seems thinnest and choose products that can help increase the appearance of volume in that area.








Use a ""light"" or ""airier"" product. Heavy gels, sprays, waxes and mousses can leave hair matted down and greasy looking, which will increase the appearance of thinning hair. As a general rule, the less you feel the product in your hair, the better it is for increasing the appearance of volume.Mousse is generally preferable to wax or gel-based styling products. This is because mousse tends to leave less residue in your hair after it has been styled.The effects of volumizing styling products should be evident immediately after use.

, If a volumizing styling product leaves your hair feeling “crispy” or “crunchy” it is probably not ideal for increasing the appearance of volume. The more flexible your hair is after using a volumizing styling product, the more effective it will be in increasing the appearance of volume., While gels, mousses, waxes and sprays do help increase the appearance of volume, their effects are temporary. You will need to maintain a consistent regimen when using these products to most effectively increase the appearance of volume.It is best to follow the label’s recommendations for applying a volumizing product. Generally, overuse of any topical styling product, volumizing or otherwise, leaves too much of that product in your hair throughout the course of the day, leading to a patchy or matted appearance. So, use an amount of the product that is recommended on the label or, if possible, use less than recommended.
Most styling products recommend application to damp or moist hair. This helps the product to uniformly coat your hair follicles.

, Dry hair tends to appear more voluminous than wet hair or hair that has been oversaturated with product. For the best results, blow dry your hair after using a volumizing styling product.

Avoid combing your hair.,
Apply styling products to the tips, not the roots.,
Experiment with various style adjustments.,
Solicit an outside opinion.,
Employ a “comb over” technique.,
Grow longer hair.,
Cut your hair short or shave your head.",How to Add Volume to Hair (for Men)2," Combs, while long considered the ideal tool for styling a man's hair, can negatively impact the appearance of volume. Combs have a tendency to pull and tear at the roots of the hair and can pull hairs in an unusual direction, which opens up larger patches of visible scalp. Use your hands to style your hair for better results in increasing the appearance of volume., Applying a volumizing styling product to the roots of your hair can have an adverse effect on the appearance of volume. Again, this is because applying products to the roots of your hair will tend to cause a clumping effect, making areas of the scalp more visible.







, Changing your hair style to maximize the appearance of volume is often a process of trial and error. Spend some time trying various techniques to see what works best for you.








Use your fingers and hands to make the necessary alterations. If you have naturally curly or wavy hair, try breaking up the curls and waves with your fingers to help maximize the appearance of volume.If your hair is straight, try “lifting at the roots” to increase the appearance of volume.Apply more styling product to the areas where the hair seems thinnest and use less on the areas that are already voluminous. This should help ensure that the application of styling products leaves your hair looking naturally thick and not oversaturated with product., When attempting to adjust your hair style to increase the appearance of volume, it is important to ask someone else what they think of your “new” style. Often times, we are the worst judges of our own appearance because we are too invested in, or close to, the problem and the solution. Asking a trusted friend or relative what they think of your new style should allow you to better gauge the effectiveness of your hair style adjustment.


It is important to note here that, sometimes, thinning hair may look better on you than drastically altering your hair style to increase the appearance of volume. Since the manifestation of hair thinness is specific to you, make sure the solution is equally personal.

, If your hair seems to be thinning at the top of your head, it can sometimes be effective to take the areas where your hair is thickest and comb that area over where your hair is thinning. Many men, both with and without thinning hair, choose to employ a “side part” method of style their hair. This method can easily be used to comb hair over thinning areas while looking as if it is a natural style choice.








While comb overs are effective in some cases, a widespread cultural understanding of this method often makes it easy to identify when a man is using a comb over to cover up areas of thinness. Moreover, comb overs are often ineffective if the area of thinning hair is too large or drastic to effectively cover up. In cases like this, comb overs often exacerbate the noticeability of thinning hair., Since all areas of your hair are unlikely to be thinning equally, it can often be beneficial to grow your hair longer to cover up the areas of thinning hair. In particular, if you are experiencing hair thinness around the forehead or the temples, allowing your hair to grow to a length where it is able to “hang” down off of your head can help to increase the appearance of hair volume., In contemporary society, some men choose to wear their hair short as a style choice irrespective of lacking volume. Utilizing a crew cut or simply shaving your head may be a good look for you and can go a long way in covering the appearance of thinning hair."

Exhaust other options.,
Identify user-reviewed hair growth products.,
Purchase hair growth products from a reliable source.,
Read instructions carefully.,
Apply as directed.,
Decide if “coloring” will increase the appearance of volume.",How to Add Volume to Hair (for Men)3," Purchasing hair growth tonics, pills, gels, topical creams, and rubs can be expensive and, often times, these products fail to produce the desired results. Because of this, it is important to try less expensive or less invasive products and styling tactics before deciding to purchase a hair growth product., It is important to keep in mind that someone out there is suffering or has suffered from the same pattern of thinning hair as you. Search the internet to find other men who suffer from the same problem, have tried to increase the volume of their hair with growth products, and solicit their opinions. Chances are someone out there is suffering from a lack of volume in the same ways you are and has had success with a particular brand or type of hair growth product.The two most popular hair growth products on the market contain minoxidil (found in products such as Rogaine) and finasteride (found in products like Propecia). Minoxidil is a topical treatment and finasteride comes in pill form. It is important to note that these products both have better success rates at stopping hair loss than they do with re-growing lost hair.Topical hair growth products that contain minoxidil can take up to four months to work. So stick with the routine and be patient when looking for results., Lack of volume is a common problem among men. Because of this, a wide variety of retailers, both online and offline, offer hair growth solutions. However, many of these retailers carry off-brand or “bargain” hair growth products that show little proven effectiveness in increasing the volume of your hair. Be sure you purchase your hair growth product from a reliable and trusted retailer to ensure your money is well spent.

, Hair growth products are often composed of various active ingredients, many of which can be harmful to one’s hair or overall health if not properly applied. Make sure you read all the instructions and warnings on a product’s packaging before use.


Some hair growth products have been linked to a diminished sex drive in men, so read the warning label carefully and be aware if you are experiencing any of the listed side effects.Some hair growth products, especially those using the active ingredient finasteride, have been proven dangerous to women who are nursing or pregnant. As this is the case, be sure to store the product responsibly and avoid leaving exposed or crushed pills out in the open., Following the directions on the product’s packaging, apply the hair growth product to the areas where you are experiencing a lack of volume. Application, in general, requires you to gently rub or massage the product into your scalp for 3 to 5 minutes, twice a day. However, this method changes from product to product. Also, it takes anywhere from 12 to 16 weeks to see the best results with these products, so do not expect an immediate impact.







, Often times, darkening the shade of one’s hair can increase the appearance of volume. If you feel this could be beneficial to you, identify reliable hair coloring products, select a shade that will blend nicely with your natural hair color, and apply as directed.Take care not select a color that is much darker than your natural hair color, as an unnatural or overly dark shade can make it obvious that you used a hair coloring product. Also, selecting a very dark shade of hair coloring can actually make your hair look less voluminous if it greatly contrasts with the color of your roots."

Follow post-procedure directions.",How to Add Volume to Hair (for Men)4," Receiving surgery to increase the volume of your hair is a drastic step and must be considered carefully. If you are experiencing a minor lack of hair volume, surgery is likely not a worthwhile solution to your volume problem. Again, these procedures can be very expensive and, at times, can have painful side effects. Make sure you are well-educated about hair transplant surgery before moving forward with the procedure., Speaking with a hair transplant professional will give you a better idea of the overall effects a hair transplant surgery will have on your particular volume problem. Furthermore, a specialist will be able to inform you about the limitations, side effects, and cost of hair transplant surgery., As noted above, hair transplant surgery can be very expensive and is not covered by most insurance policies. Be prepared to pay out of pocket for this procedure and, before scheduling the procedure, make sure the benefits of increasing hair volume will be worth the costs., Recovering from hair transplant surgery often involves some tenderness of the scalp and affected areas. Be prepared to take the necessary time off from work and other responsibilities, as your recovery process may require you to take heavy pain medications., Most hair transplant surgeries involve removing a patch of hair-growing scalp from the back of the head and replanting this patch in areas where hair no longer grows. This procedure should be carried out in a doctor’s office under local anesthesia., It is critical that you follow the instructions of the doctor performing the hair transplant surgery to ensure the success of your procedure. You may need to avoid washing or combing your hair, vigorous activities, excessive contact to newly-planted hair follicles, or other activities for a designated period of time.Recovery time for hair transplant surgeries varies from person to person. On average, recovery periods last from 3 to 10 days.Be aware that the transplanted hair will fall out after the surgery. However, you should begin to see new growth between 9 and 12 months after your operation."

Simply take a fork and insert one of the side prongs into the top of the lighter between the 2 wheels, and simply force it up.,
From there you can simply use needle-nose pliers or fingers as above to remove it fully.",How to Remove a Safety Band from a Bic Lighter2," (You may have to use a thinner item, such as a small screwdriver, or a thicker paperclip; depends on the brand, again. For a Bic, a fork should work pretty well.) This forces the safety out from the prongs which hold it in -- although it should be mentioned, for the sake of safety, that sometimes it pops out fully and can hit you in the eye. (Use safety glasses, I guess?)






;
, This often saves you from having to re-adjust the prongs, which can often nick your thumb, even after they've been flattened. If the prongs actually came undone, just push them back in with a hard flat object, such as the butt end of the screwdriver. You can even just press them against the edge of the table.

Hold the lighter in your dominant hand.,
Rest your thumb on the sparkwheel.,
With a quick, powerful motion of your thumb, roll the sparkwheel down into the ignition button.,
Keep trying until you make a flame.",How to Use a Lighter1," Locate the sparkwheel and the ignition button.


The spark wheel is made of serrated, hardened steel wire. When it is rotated with sufficient speed and force, it will strike a bar of flint within the lighter, creating a spark.The ignition button, when pressed, releases the gas valve to the fuel tank. In order to light the lighter, you'll need to strike the sparkwheel and hold the ignition button at the exact same time. Don't worry--the process is much simpler than it may sound.
On Bic lighters, the ignition button is made of red plastic, and it sits on the fork of the lighter next to the sparkwheel. On Zippo lighters, the ignition button is round and metallic, and it is embedded into the lighter directly below the sparkwheel.;
, You can use the tip of your thumb, or either side--but make sure that you have the leverage to roll the sparkwheel into the ignition button. Your thumb should sit near the apex of the sparkwheel, but slightly down the arc toward the ignition button.









Find a grip that feels comfortable. You may need to experiment with your thumb at several angles before you get it right.
Apply light pressure to the sparkwheel, such that the sparkwheel presses into the ignition button and releases the gas valve. Now, you just need to make a spark.

, Do not move anything but your thumb, and then keep holding down the ignition button to keep the gas flowing. If you don't see a flame, try again.









If it works, the sparkwheel will strike a spark, which will ignite the gas that is released by the ignition button. You will know immediately: either the lighter will make a steady flame, or nothing will happen.
If you roll the sparkwheel with sufficient speed and force, but the lighter sparks and does not ignite--try again. If the lighter continues to spark but not ignite, the gas reserves may be low or empty. Try using another lighter.

, If you are having trouble, try pressing harder on the sparkwheel and placing your thumb slightly closer to the ignition button. This may give you extra leverage to apply more force.









Make sure that you're rolling the sparkwheel fast enough. Grip the rest of the lighter with your other four fingers, as if clenching a fist around a stress ball, and only move your thumb. Keep your hand steady.
Try pressing the ignition button once or twice without using the sparkwheel, just to make sure that you are pressing it down all the way. If you aren't applying enough force, you may not be releasing enough gas.

Slow down your lifts.,
Vary the speed of your reps. Fast reps and slow reps both have their place, provided you can lift rapidly with proper form.,
Use heavier weights.,
Allow adequate recovery time.,
Increase the weight you use gradually.,
Use a variety of machines.,
Track your training sessions.,
Keep your cardio exercise moderate.",How to Accelerate Muscle Growth1," Many people believe that if you want bigger muscles, you need to lift heavy weights as quickly as possible, doing as many reps as possible. However, slower reps enable you to concentrate on the muscles you're working and ensure perfect form.With slower rates, you also have the opportunity to take your muscles through their full range of motion, leading to more even growth.;
, Varying the speed of your reps introduces an element of surprise so your muscles don't adapt to the same movement.For example, you might start with a moderately paced set, then move to a fast set, then move to a slow set, then go back to a moderately paced set.
Don't lift any faster than you can with proper form. Make sure that on the fast reps you aren't cheating the movement but are going through your full range of motion.

, If you're trying to accelerate muscle growth, you need to lift the heaviest possible weight you can lift for the number of repetitions you have planned. Your muscles won't grow unless they are adequately challenged.Make sure you can lift the weight with proper form for the given exercise. If you can't complete the range of motion in the exercise, choose a lower weight.
Using heavier weights typically means fewer repetitions. However, using the heaviest possible weight you can use with 8 to 10 repetitions is one way to significantly accelerate muscle growth.

, Muscle growth doesn't happen while you're working out – it happens while your muscles are recovering. You should leave at least 48 hours between exercising a particular muscle group to give the muscles adequate time to recover and grow.Create a regimen that targets specific muscles groups on specific days to enable rest days for other muscle groups. For example, you may have leg day on Monday, work your arms and shoulders on Tuesday, work your core on Wednesday, and then work your legs again on Thursday.

, You should be testing your max weights every few weeks, or at least once a month, and increasing as necessary so that you're always working out with the heaviest possible weight you can use for the exercise in question., Just as with varying the speed of your repetitions, varying the types of machines you use keeps your muscles from adapting to a particular type of movement. Allowing your muscles to get used to a particular motion will slow muscle growth., Over time, it can be easy to forget the number of reps you were doing of a particular lift or exercise, or the amount of weight you used last time. Keeping a detailed log of your weights and repetitions allows you to stay on track.To have solid gains, you must have a handle on exactly what exercises you've done with each training session and how much weight you used.
You also might benefit from including other observations such as how you felt, what you ate before your workout, and what the atmosphere was like in the gym, since all of these things can affect your performance.

, While cardio is important to build endurance and increase your overall cardiovascular health, too much cardio can slow muscle growth. If you want to build larger muscles, your focus should be on anaerobic exercises such as weight lifting.Limit cardio exercise to 75 minutes of vigorous activity (i.e. running), or 150 minutes of moderate activity (i.e. walking) per week.

Reduce anxiety.,
Think nonsexual thoughts.,
Try edging.,
Change positions.,
Take it slow.,
Focus on foreplay.",How to Stop Premature Ejaculation1," For many men anxiety and pressure to perform is a major contributor to premature ejaculation. Relax and remember that your partner probably cares about more than the timing of your orgasms, and that premature ejaculation doesn't mean you can't still be good in bed.


Take climaxing out of your expectations. Instead of viewing intercourse only as a means of achieving orgasm, reframe it as relaxing, pleasurable time with your partner that you'll enjoy regardless of ejaculation. Discuss this new mindset with your partner, so that he or she can stop pressuring you, intentionally or not.;
, If you notice yourself getting too excited, turn your thoughts to something distant, abstract and unsexy, such as math, rush hour traffic or baseball. Only dwell on it long enough to give yourself a short break from arousal, maybe 5 to 10 seconds, then refocus your attention on your partner. Avoid thinking of a topic that is going to make you stressed or cause you to lose your arousal entirely.

, Edging, or orgasm control, is the practice of maintaining a high level of sexual arousal while delaying ejaculation. It takes practice, but it gets easier over time. Here are two methods recommended by the National Institutes of Health to stop premature ejaculation:


Stop-and-start method: Have intercourse as usual until you feel yourself coming uncomfortably close to orgasm. Immediately and abruptly cease all stimulation for 30 seconds, then start again. Repeat this pattern until you're ready to ejaculate.
Squeeze method: Have intercourse as usual until you feel like orgasm is seconds away. Abruptly stop other stimulation and gently squeeze your thumb and forefinger around the part of the penis where the glans meets the shaft (or your partner could do this). After squeezing for a few seconds, pause all stimulation for another 30 seconds before resuming intercourse. Repeat this pattern until you're ready to ejaculate.

, Some intercourse positions put less pressure on the glans (or the most sensitive part of the penis). Here's what to do:


Try ""passive"" positions. Lie beneath your female partner, or try a side-by-side (or spooning) position.
Avoid ""active"" positions. Missionary and rear-entry positions place the most stimulation and friction on the glans, so consider taking them off the menu for now.

, Depending on your personal sensitivity, slowing your movements and opting for gentler, more teasing intercourse can help you hold off orgasm longer. If you find yourself getting too close to orgasm, slow down for a bit, change to a new position, or take a break to stimulate your partner in other ways.

, Sometimes ""premature"" is a frame of mind. Even if your ejaculation comes quickly during intercourse, you can still give your partner a great sexual experience through more extended, intimate, attentive and generous foreplay. Stimulate your partner enough manually, orally or with toys, and they may not need or want a long bout of intercourse to finish happy.

",How to Replace a Zippo Wick,"






;
, If the flint spring screw is too tight to unscrew by hand, use a small flat screwdriver to loosen it first. You can also use the top lid of your lighter to do this as well.








, Tip out the flint from the bottom of the insert into the empty shell of the Zippo for safekeeping. If it does not fall right out, give it a gentle tap and it should fall right out.








, Set the Zippo shell aside.








, You'll notice that it is not all one big wad of cotton but many small overlapping wads. As you set them aside, lay them in more or less the same order or configuration as they were inside the insert. (this will be helpful later).








, Pull it through so that there is only as much wick in the chimney as will reach the top of the chimney.








,, The pieces each should have some shape that you can fit together like a puzzle.








, You should run out of length of wick before you run out of cotton.








, Replace the flint. Insert and screw the flint spring until it won't turn any more. There is no need to screw too tightly as long as it does screw in all the way so that the lighter will close properly.

",How to Use Bic Flints in Your Zippo," Grab your butane lighter, Zippo and a small flathead screwdriver.;
, Use the screwdriver to remove the wheel from the butane lighter. Keeping your hand over the top of the lighter gently pry the wheel pin out of the plastic frame.

, After you have one side of the wheel free gently pull the wheel out of the other side. The spring that holds the flint taught will launch the flint up so keep the light in your closed hand.

, The flint you get from the butane lighter may be a little big for your Zippo so you'll need to cut it in two. Just lay the flint down on a cutting board, take a sharp knife and set it in the middle of the flint. Start rolling forward and back, scoring the flint. When it gets a nice start, put your hand on the back of the knife and keep cutting. Your hand will help catch the pieces when the knife cuts through.

, Now it's time to put the flint in the Zippo! Remove the insert from the case, use the screwdriver to remove the spring. Pop the flint in the hole and replace the spring. Tighten the screw just tight enough, but not too tight you don't want to end up stripping it.

, Refill your Zippo with fluid (if needed) and replace the insert in the case. Give it a strike and you are back in action!

Stub it out.",How to Smoke a Cigarette," There are certain preparatory rituals associated with smoking, and chief among those is packing. This is accomplished by inverting an unopened pack of cigarettes, and rapping it smartly, three to six times, against a table or your palm (spanking the camel). This condenses the loose tobacco so that it's a little tighter in the paper, and in theory, burns a little smoother, and lasts longer.






;
, Either tear open one end of the exposed silver foil, or for flip-top packs, remove the cellophane, then the foil.









At this point, many people remove the first cigarette, invert it so the tobacco side is up, and then replace it in the package. For some, this is for good luck. For others it's just a ritual that they may have learned from another smoker. In any case, the lucky cigarette is the last one smoked.

, A new pack of smokes will be fairly tightly packed. Invert the pack of exposed cigarettes and rap against your finger to encourage the cigarettes to come out of the pack. When one has emerged far enough to take up with your fingers, do so.









A pack that's been partially emptied will be much easier to retrieve cigarettes from.
There is a significant degree of coolness imparted when one removes the emerging cigarette with teeth and lips, rather than fingers.

, Whether you pull it from the pack with your fingers or your mouth, you'll eventually be holding the cigarette. This is an entirely personal choice with no rules, but there are some common methods of smoking to be aware of:









Classic. Hold the cigarette between the index and middle finger, between the first and second knuckle, palm facing downward.
Sophisticated. Same as the Classic, but with palm facing you and fingers pointing upward.
Casual. Cigarette is set behind the second knuckle of the middle finger, and secured by wrapping the index finger around it. The hand is in a relaxed, closed position, with palm towards you or facing downward.
Euro I. The cigarette is held between the thumb and forefinger, palm out, cigarette pointing outward.
Euro II. The cigarette is held between thumb and forefinger, palm facing in and slightly up, with filter end pointing directly at you. This is how they always spotted the Nazi spy in the movies. (Or by not holding it this way, how they found the American spies).
Palmed. Cigarette is pinched between thumb and forefinger, but palm is facing in, and cigarette is secreted in hand, pointing towards inner wrist. Useful when you don't want it to be obvious that you're smoking.
Feminine. Cigarette is held between the first and second knuckles of the index and middle fingers. Hand is relaxed and bent backwards, with palm facing up.

, If you pulled it out of the pack with your teeth, you're already there. If not, put the filtered end of the cigarette between your lips.









Some prefer to smoke on one side or another, others in the middle. If you want to know, before you light up in public for the first time, try practicing with a pen or pencil to see what feels right for you.
If you're smoking unfiltered cigarettes (""straights""), such as Lucky Strikes or Camel Studs, in theory it doesn't matter which end you put between your lips. In general, however, you'll insert the end with the logo or brand on it.

, Bring your match or lighter up to the tip of the cigarette, and suck in as if you're sucking a milkshake through a straw. Don't inhale when lighting a cigarette: just take a couple short, firm draws on it to get the tobacco lit. Factory-made cigarettes will generally light quickly and burn uniformly.








, Once your cigarette is lit, pull a little smoke into your mouth. When you're first starting, avoid bringing in too much smoke — you'll regret it when you turn green and start coughing.








, This will let it cool down, which will help keep your throat from becoming irritated. It will also alter the flavor of the smoke, which is objectionable to some. This you will decide with experience.








, As you take it out, inhale the smoke into your lungs by taking a deep breath. This will help avoid irritating your throat and triggering the cough reflex.









Note that this is not like smoking a joint, where you inhale directly into your lungs.
An alternate form of inhalation is called ""Frenching"". To do this, before you inhale, push some of the smoke back into the air (without exhaling), and as it exits your mouth, suck it in with your nose. This may take some practice to perfect.
As you continue to smoke, your tolerance for the smoke will increase. This is where the problems arise: the more tolerance you have for the sheer act of inhaling smoke, the easier it will be to smoke. The more you smoke, the more nicotine you ingest, the more addicted you get as you build a tolerance for nicotine. To get the same feeling you did from your first cigarette, you need greater amounts of nicotine, which makes you smoke more.

, Part of the ritual of smoking is where you place your cigarette hand when you remove the cigarette from your mouth. Like holding a cigarette, there are no hard and fast rules, but there are common practices, depending on the sex of the smoker.









Women often rotate their arm from the shoulder, keeping the cigarette at mouth level, to one side, with palm up and hand facing outward.
Men rotate their arm at the elbow, keeping their palm inward, and lowering their hand to mid torso.

, As you move your hand into position, blow the smoke out through your mouth or nose. There is no right or wrong way to do this, but you will develop preferences.









Some say blowing out through their nose lets them get more flavor from the smoke, while others don't like the burning sensation.
Some people let the smoke ""dribble"" out of their mouth, exhaling slowly, while others blow it out forcefully.
With practice, you can learn to blow smoke rings by forming your mouth in an ""O"" shape, then using your throat to push the smoke over your tongue and through your lips.

, Another ritualistic (yet necessary) part of smoking is flicking off the ash. As you burn the cigarette, the part that has been smoked will remain on the tip of your cigarette as a fine gray ash that's remarkably tenacious. Still, when it reaches a certain point, gravity takes over and the ash will fall to the ground. If you're walking down the street, this is not a problem. If, however, you're standing indoors, most people frown on having cigarette ash dropped on their floor, so it's best to use an ashtray to remove the ash from your cigarette.









How you hold your cigarette will determine how you flick your cigarette.
If you hold it such that the filter end is in the vicinity of your thumb, a quick flick over the ashtray, and the ash will tumble neatly into the tray.
If you're holding the cigarette pinched between thumb and forefinger, a quick tap in the middle of the cigarette with your index or ring finger will send those ashes tumbling.
You can also tap the cigarette itself against the lip of the ashtray, so that the ashes are encouraged to fall into the tray.

, Once you're done with the cigarette, you'll want to dispose of it safely. You do this by grinding it and stubbing it in the ashtray until it stops smoking. Outside, grind the cigarette against a non-flammable surface until it's out, then dispose of the cigarette properly. Nobody wants to deal with your used butts—it's rude, crude and socially unacceptable. Flicking your butts out the window is also extremely dangerous and has been the start of many forest and brush fires. Get caught flicking, and you could be fined heavily. Get caught causing a brush fire, and you're looking at serious legal problems.









How much of the cigarette you smoke before you're done depends on how much of a cigarette you like to smoke. Obviously, you won't smoke the filter, and if smoking straights, there's only so much cigarette you can smoke until you're frying your lips.
Many people smoke until it's just above the filter, or till you can't put it in your mouth.
Others prefer to put out a cigarette after it reaches the halfway point, so the smoke remains cleaner and cooler.

Total charging time takes 1.5 hours., The iTaste VV 3.0 has variable wattage and voltage settings that let you control the temperature of your vapor. You can customize your vape by changing the settings. To check the settings, turn the device on by pushing the power/fire button three times. Hold the + and – buttons together for two seconds. Look at the display screen for your current settings:The first reading is the clearomizer resistance
The second reading is the battery voltage
The third reading is the puff counter
The fourth reading is the current voltage setting (U) or the current wattage setting (P)

, With the iTaste VV 3.0, you can either control it by wattage or voltage. On the variable wattage setting, the device will regulate the voltage based on the clearomizer you're using. To set the device to the wattage setting, hold the fire and + buttons. The display will say P and the wattage setting.


If you're just starting out and haven't figured out what you like yet, start out using the variable wattage on the lowest setting, which is 6.Once you’ve tried that setting a few times, you can increase the wattage to see how it affects the temperature. The higher the wattage, the hotter the temperature of the vapor.
Use the + (increase) or – (decrease) buttons to adjust the wattage when the display is on the P reading.

, When you use the voltage setting instead, you have to control the voltage based on the clearomizer and juice you're using. This means you have to fine-tune the settings more than with the wattage control, and it can take some trial and error.To switch to voltage control, hold the fire and – buttons.
Use the + (increase) or – (decrease) buttons to change the voltage when the display is on the U reading.
The higher the voltage, the higher the temperature.

Know the limitations of folk remedies.,
Mix some vinegar and mayonnaise.,
Apply eggs to your hair.,
Apply oils to increase volume.,
Try using a combination of natural products.",How to Add Volume to Hair (for Men)5," For hundreds of years, men have been trying to add volume to their hair through folk remedies. Much of the evidence for success with these remedies is anecdotal and the impact of the following remedies remains unproven by medical science.

, According to anecdotal evidence, this combination can help add volume to thinning hair and help hair grow faster. Combine the ingredients together, and then apply liberally to the hair, rubbing the mixture into the scalp. Leave the vinegar and mayo mixture in place for at least 20 minutes before washing it out and shampooing as usual.









The effects of this tactic occur gradually, so be patient and repeat the process monthly.
It can also be beneficial to wrap your head in cellophane after this treatment and cover your head with a towel.

, Protein plays a large role in contributing to the volume of hair. One folk remedy is to crack one to two eggs (depending on the length of your hair) into a bowl, whisk the eggs up into a well beaten mix and then apply the mix to your wet hair. Allow the eggs to sit in your hair for at least 30 minutes before washing it out with lukewarm water. Use this method once or twice a week.


It can take up to several months to see a noticeable difference in volume when using eggs to increase the thickness of your hair.

, Certain oils, usually associated with cooking, have been said to add the appearance of volume to your hair. Both olive oil and castor oil have shown some ability to add the appearance of volume. When trying this method, rub the oil liberally throughout your hair and massage the oil down to the scalp. Let it sit for 30 to 45 minutes and wash the oil out with a mild shampoo. The process should be repeated bi-weekly.


Like other home remedies, the impact of this treatment occurs gradually. It can take up to two or three months to notice a difference in the volume of your hair.

, Avocados have been shown to contain vitamin E, which can increase the appearance of volume in your hair. When trying to increase volume with natural food products, blend together one whole avocado, one mashed banana, and a tablespoon of olive oil. Massage the mixture gently into your scalp and let it sit for 30 minutes before washing it out with a mild shampoo.

Hold the lighter vertically in your hand.,
Be judicious with the flame.,
Do not allow your lighter to burn continuously for more than two minutes.,
Consider adjusting the gas flow.,
Be aware that butane lighters do not work well above 10,000 feet.,
Consider removing the safety band from a Bic lighter to make it easier to light.",How to Use a Lighter2," Keep it below the thing that you are trying to light. The flame will remain vertical, regardless of the angle of the lighter, and you may burn your hand if you try to hold the lighter horizontally.


Keep your hand away from the flame, and from the thing that you are lighting. Be careful not to burn yourself.

, Fire is powerful, and it can easily take on a life of its own. Never light a fire that you aren't prepared to put out on your own.


Avoid lighting fires in flammable settings, at least until you are more confident in your ability.
Only strike your lighter in a well-ventilated area. If you smell gas in the air, or if you know that there has been a leak, don't risk igniting it. Avoid using your lighter while filling up gas, or while handling containers that have held flammable gas.
Be especially cautious when lighting fires in dry woodlands or grasslands, particularly in the summer. Wildfires can burn thousands of acres from only a spark, and the wind can take a fire out of your control in an instant.

, If the lighter burns for too long, it will overheat, to the danger of your hand and any flammable surroundings.


Lighters are made from metal and plastic, both of which conduct heat rather well. Be careful not to burn yourself.
If a lighter grows too hot to handle, let it cool down for a few minutes before you resume using it.

, Some lighters come with a small switch on the side--usually a black plastic back-and-forth switch between + and - signs. The + side will make the biggest possible flame, and the - sign will make the smallest possible flame. You can usually adjust the switch to any point in between.









If you want to conserve gas, keep the switch toward the - side. Adjust as necessary.
If you want a large, impressive flame, or if you want to keep your hand far away from the thing that you are lighting, keep the switch toward the + side. Be aware that this will guzzle the fuel reserves much more quickly: larger flame means more gas.

, If you're venturing to high altitudes, consider bringing matches.

, This is the smooth band of metal that runs around the center of the spark wheel's circumference. This trick may help if you do not have the finger strength or the flexibility to turn the sparkwheel otherwise.









Turn the sparkwheel until you find the gap in the safety band: a point where the metal does not quite meet. Stick a narrow but sturdy object, like a key or a screwdriver, through the flame hole of the lighter, and use the rim of the hole as leverage to pry the safety band apart.Work slowly, and protect your eyes--the safety band has been known to fly off suddenly.
Be aware that the safety band is there to keep children from using the lighter.Your sparkwheel will turn more easily with the band gone, but make sure that you store it properly.

Consume a surplus of calories.,
Eat a lot of protein-rich foods.,
Include plant-based proteins.,
Choose your carbs carefully.,
Use flax seeds rather than flaxseed oil.,
Consume a lot of leafy greens.,
Replace rice with quinoa.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Accelerate Muscle Growth2," You can't expect to build larger and stronger muscles unless you're giving your body the food it needs to increase muscle mass. To estimate how many calories you need to consume, multiply your body weight in pounds by 15-17 calories (e.g. if you weigh 170 lbs. multiply that by 16 to get a daily calorie intake of 2,720). If you aren’t gaining the muscle mass you want after a few weeks, bump up your calorie intake by 10%.Look on bodybuilding websites or talk to bodybuilders to find out ways to get the calories you need for muscle gains.
Make sure the foods you're eating are healthy and nutritious – don't just load up on junk food and empty calories.

, Protein is the building block of muscles, so if you want to accelerate muscle growth you should eat 10-25 g of protein with each meal or snack. Lean chicken, lean beef and fish provide your body with the protein it needs to burn more calories and create lean muscle.Grass-fed beef also contains a variety of essential vitamins and minerals in addition to protein that help the body build muscle, such as vitamin B12, heme iron, zinc, creatine, and carnosine.You should aim to eat approximately 1 g of protein per pound of body weight. This means you'll have to adjust your protein intake as your weight fluctuates.

, If you don't eat meat, it may be more difficult for you to accelerate muscle growth, but it's not impossible. Even if you do eat meat, you should supplement your meat-based protein sources with those that are plant-based.Soybeans, nuts, and legumes are excellent sources of protein. Almonds, for example, are a good snack to eat before a workout and can be added to a fitness shake.
Get organic foods if possible, or stick to those with little to no additives and preservatives. The fewer additives and preservatives the body has to break down, the more effective these foods will be at helping you build muscle.

, Carbs can give you energy while you're working out – but the wrong carbs could result in blood sugar crashes that destroy all the work you've done to accelerate muscle growth.Look for low-glycemic carbohydrates such as apples, pears, whole grains, sweet potatoes, and beans.
Read nutritional labels carefully and choose carbs that also are higher in fiber and lower in calories.

, Flax seeds are a good source of omega-3, fiber, and protein, while flaxseed oil does not contain fiber and is highly unstable. Flax seeds also contain a solid amount of omega-3 fatty acids, which help reduce inflammation.Reducing inflammation in your body means your muscles won't be as sore after intense workouts, and also that they will recover at a faster rate.

, There's a reason the cartoon character Popeye ate spinach. Leafy green vegetables such as kale and spinach have a high nutritional content, low fat, and high soluble fiber, making them vital if you want to accelerate muscle growth.Leafy greens also have the added benefit of protecting your body from cancer and cardiovascular disease.

, Quinoa is a grain that has more protein and fiber than rice or oats, and also contains high amounts of manganese, magnesium, and phosphorous. You can choose from red, black, or white quinoa., Drinking water is perhaps the most important thing you can do to accelerate muscle growth. Sip water during your workouts, and drink a pint of water for every pint of weight lost through sweat.Drink 8 to 10 glasses of water a day, or more, to ensure your body is adequately hydrated before you exercise.
Adequate hydration also ensures that your body can transport the nutrients you consume efficiently. Eating healthy foods won't help you much in terms of building muscle if those nutrients never reach your muscles.

Avoid dangerous or illicit supplements.,
Talk to a dietician or nutritionist.,
Evaluate bottle labels carefully.,
Get sufficient amino acids.,
Choose vitamin supplements that encourage muscle growth.,
Take a fish oil supplement.,
Give supplements at least a month to work.,
Adjust protein supplements to fit your diet.",How to Accelerate Muscle Growth3," There are no legitimate short cuts to muscle gains. There are many supplements that claim to enable you to build muscle quickly, but may come with disastrous long-term health consequences., When you're trying to accelerate muscle growth, the best way to do so safely is to talk to someone who has experience with sports or bodybuilding nutrition and can advise you on which supplements will most benefit you.If you're a member of a gym, they typically will have a dietician or nutritionist on staff who you can consult. If not, they may be able to recommend someone local who can help you.
Once you have recommendations from a dietician or nutritionist, talk them over with your healthcare provider before you start any supplements, particularly if you are at risk or have a history of nutrition-related health issues.

, The bottle of any nutritional supplement will have important information about recommended dosages based on your age and sex. Be careful not to exceed these recommended dosages, or you may put yourself at risk for health problems such as loss of appetite and osteoporosis.Check the bottle as well and make sure all seals are still intact and it has not been tampered with.

, Amino acids are protein-builders, and are essential if you want to gain strength and grow larger muscles. They also help in fat loss and recovery after workouts.You can get amino acids from meat, dairy, and seafood, but it's possible you won't get all the amino acids you need through food sources. For this reason, an amino acid supplement can be beneficial if you want to accelerate muscle growth.
Amino acid supplements are especially important if you are a vegan or vegetarian and want significant muscle gains.
Keep in mind your body does not store excess amino acids, which means sufficient consumption is a daily requirement.

, There are a number of vitamins, including vitamins C, D, and E, as well as B vitamins, that are essential for healthy muscle growth.Minerals such as calcium and magnesium also are essential if you want to accelerate muscle growth.
A good multi-vitamin should provide you all the muscle-building vitamins and minerals you need. You may want to ask a dietician or nutritionist for a recommendation.

, A 1,000- to 3,000-mg fish oil supplement will increase blood flow to your muscles, which reduces inflammation and helps accelerate muscle recovery after workouts, leading to enhanced growth.Look for a supplement that provides the omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA.
If you are a vegetarian or vegan, you can get the same omega-3 fatty acids present in fish oil from flax seed, chia seeds, or an algae-based supplement.

, You may not notice any results from supplements when you first start taking them. In most cases, it takes at least four weeks before you'll start to see any difference in your results.Measure your muscles on a weekly basis for awhile before you start taking supplements. Once you've reached the four-week mark, start measuring them again and compare the gains after supplements to the gains before.

, If you're taking protein supplements, remember that they are meant to supplement the protein you're getting from food sources. Calculate the amount of protein you should consume each day, and make sure you're not consuming much more than that.Too much protein will not increase the benefits or cause you to grow muscles more quickly, and may have a negative effect on your health in the long run.

Do PC muscle exercises.,
Practice controlling your orgasm.",How to Stop Premature Ejaculation2," Flexing and strengthening your pubococcygeus (PC) muscle can help you exert more control over ejaculation. (Note that these are also called Kegel exercises, which you might have heard about women doing. The muscle is the same in both sexes.)Locate your PC muscle. Put one or two fingers right behind your testicles. Pretend that you are urinating, then try to stop the flow with a quick muscle contraction. That muscle you just used to stop the flow from the bladder is your PC muscle.
Flex the muscle regularly. Try to do 10 to 20 squeezes in a set, 2 or 3 times a day. Do a set whenever you're bored or stationary—like when you're sitting at your desk or in traffic. No one will be able to see that you're doing them.
Squeeze your PC muscle when you feel ejaculation coming on. Once the muscle is strong enough, you should be able to hold it off just like stopping flow when urinating.

, When masturbating or with a patient partner, focus on improving your control over your climax. Stimulate yourself to the edge of climax and then stop. Do this several times before finishing. As you practice, learn to recognize the feeling of getting close to orgasm, and take note of how close you can get and still effectively stop, and when you've reached a ""point of no return."" During intercourse, use that knowledge to slow down or adjust your movements if you get too close too early.

"
See a doctor.,
Know what treatment options to expect.",How to Stop Premature Ejaculation3," If you routinely ejaculate less than a minute and a half after beginning vaginal intercourse, and none of the above fixes have worked, it might be time to see a medical professional. You can visit a urologist, sex therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist for help.

, The treatment that your doctor recommends will depend on your age, overall health and sexual history, but here's a rundown of the most common routes:13.jpg|center]]

A topical medication containing an anesthetic applied directly onto the penis which reduces penile sensitivity. A couple of topical over-the-counter medications are now available on the market in the US; a urologist can help you decide between the options.
A short-acting SSRI: Researchers suspect serotonin has an effect on ejaculation, and have found a certain class of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can help delay it.
A mild oral analgesic.
A tri-cyclic anti-depressant.
Intracavernous vasodilator therapy: In extreme cases, your doctor might suggest injecting a vasodilator directly into your penis before intercourse. Though this is usually a successful option, it's not something to start lightly.
Psychological sex therapy. If your doctor believes your PE is mental or emotional in origin, they may recommend therapy with a counselor to discuss, unravel and overcome your sexual anxieties or hangups.

"
"
Wear a condom.,
Use an analgesic cream or spray.,

There is a new class of topical medications that absorb into the skin to deliver a mild anesthetic to the sensory nerves below the stratum corneum (top layer of skin) of the penis.,
Apply strategic pressure.",How to Stop Premature Ejaculation4," It sounds too simple to be true, but it works for a lot of men. Condoms reduce stimulation for most men, which should prolong the time before ejaculation.


Steer clear of condoms that are marketed as extra thin. You can always upgrade to a brand that allows more stimulation later.
Some condoms are coated with a slight numbing gel on the inside. This can help you put off ejaculation for longer without causing numbness to your partner. (Just make sure you know which side is where when you put it on.)

, There are two classes of these products. The first is the traditional ""numbing"" creams and sprays that have been on the market for some time. The upside is that you'll feel less sensation, which will delay ejaculation. The downside is your partner may suffer a loss of sensation as well—and of course less sensitive intercourse is not always an appealing notion, even in these circumstances.

, This allows men to have ejaculatory control but with less loss of sexual sensation, and reduces the transference to their partners. Look for products that are compliant to FDA 21CFR 348.10 and have a ""eutectic formula"" which is the basis of the absorption technology.

, With a little anatomy knowledge, you can delay an oncoming ejaculation by applying pressure to one of two spots.


Perineum pressure: Pressing on the perineum, a spot midway between your scrotum and your anus, will help to stop ejaculation because this spot reaches through to the prostate gland. It is the prostate that contracts and expands during orgasm and then expels the ejaculation fluid. Ask your partner to apply this loving pressure for you.
Testes tug: When a man nears orgasm his scrotum rises up closer to his body. You can delay ejaculation by gently pulling your testes down and away from your body. Your partner can also do this for you.

Know the difference between PG and VG e-liquids.,
Use VG-rich e-liquids as an alternative to PG-rich products.,
Choose an e-liquid based on your personal preferences.,
Determine the amount of nicotine your e-liquid needs.,
Try out different flavors.",How to Use E Liquid1," E-liquids have a base of propylene glycol (PG) and/or vegetable glycerin (VG) with added flavoring and, of course, nicotine. In some cases, e-liquids do contain a bit of both glycerin types.E-liquids have varying ratios of the two bases but having an understanding of their qualities will help you choose brands that cater best to the experience you wish to have.
PG is commonly used as a base for most e-liquids, but might cause discomfort for consumers who are allergic, which VG based e-liquid products offer a great alternative to.;
, They are the more natural way to get your nicotine fix because it is not chemically produced and is a 100% derivative from vegetable oils.


Its thicker nature means more satisfying and thicker vapor than PG-based alternatives, but also means more frequent maintenance and cleaning of the device.Its sweeter aftertaste also slightly alters the flavor profile of most flavorings added to it.

, If you are indecisive about whether or not about the ratio of PG/VG you’d like to go with, choose a mix of the two: 50/50 PG/VG or 60/40 PG/VG.Pick an e-liquid with a ratio of 80/20 PG/VG or 100%PG if you want your vapor to have more flavor and a stronger hit.
If you want less hit and more vapor, choose an e-liquid with an 80/20 VG/PG ratio or 100% VG.

, This evaluation is dependent on how much of a smoker you were before deciding to use e-cigarettes. This is important because heavier nicotine will be needed to satisfy strong cravings, a trait that will level out over time.


Heavier smokers will need to replicate a cigarette more so their nicotine needs can be anywhere from 24 mg on up.To curb mild cravings, moderate smokers will need anything from 12-18 mg of nicotine in their e-liquids.Light smokers can fall between 3-6 mg as far as e-liquid nicotine needs., Use the trial sizes that companies typically offer to find out if your preference is spicy over fruity or fruity over sweet. Experimenting to find the flavors you like is a never ending process so have fun with it.

Choose a single room to smoke in.,
Smoke before showering.,
Choose a space that is well-ventilated.,
Don’t smoke near smoke detectors and alarms.,
Choose an out-of-the-way location.",How to Smoke a Cigarette Indoors Without Getting Caught1," If you’re trying not to get caught smoking in your own home, don’t smoke all over the house. Instead, designate a single room in your residence as a smoking room, and only smoke there., If you run the water for your bath or shower, you’ll generate a great deal of steam. This steam neutralizes other airborne scents, including cigarette smoke., If you’re smoking in a large office and want to avoid getting caught, light your cigarettes in a room with a window you can crack open. Open the window before you smoke to reduce the volume of smoke that accumulates inside.A tall and relatively disused stairwell might be a good option.

, If you smoke near a smoke detector, you could trigger it, alerting everyone in the building that you’re smoking. Even if you don’t trigger a noisy traditional smoke detector, you might get caught by a more modern smoke detector that can differentiate between fires and cigarette smoke.Newer smoke detectors use wireless signals to alert building managers when and where people are smoking.
Keep an eye out for smoke detectors when deciding where to smoke indoors.

, When smoking indoors, steer clear of high-traffic areas. Smoking in areas with lots of people about only increases the odds that you’ll be caught smoking indoors. Instead, head to a disused part of the building or an empty back room."

Look for papers that burn slowly and evenly. Look for papers that contain few chemical additives, as some chemicals burn with a bad flavor. Consider brands like RAW natural hemp rolling papers and Zig-Zags.
If you plan to carry your papers around with you, get a rolling paper protector. Put your rolling papers into this metal case to prevent them from bending and tearing. Improvise a case from an empty mint or gum tin.
Carry spare paper. Gummed strips torn from a spare paper are great for mending tears, leaks, and gaps.;
, You can visit a local tobacconist for a wide range of options, or you can find a bag of basic rolling tobacco in many liquor stores and grocery stores. Look for tobacco that contains few chemical additives. You can buy plain tobacco or flavored tobacco, depending on your taste.


Consider common, generally affordable brands like Bali Shag and American Spirit.
Consider rolling clove cigarettes. All you need to do is mix shredded cloves with your tobacco. Clove cigarettes usually contain a ratio of 60-70 percent tobacco to 30-40 percent clove.Some people like to roll their cigarettes with pipe tobacco. Feel free to do this, but keep in mind that pipe tobacco is usually longer and wetter than cigarette-rolling tobacco. Thus, it may pack too densely, and it may not burn as well in a cigarette. If you want to use pipe tobacco, try to cut it more finely and dry it out before rolling., Spread the tobacco out evenly on the rolling surface, then use a card or your fingers to form the pile into the shape of cigarette. Choose a smooth and well-lit rolling surface: a mirror, a book, or a clean table. If you don't want to put the tobacco directly onto a surface, cover it with a clean sheet of white paper.









It helps if the color of the surface contrasts with your tobacco so that the tobacco doesn't blend in. Rolling tobacco on a thick brown carpet, for instance, could quickly become a nightmare.
Make sure that the tobacco is not too compact. Tear it apart lightly so it still forms one connected unit.

, Hold the paper in the crease with your index finger of the same hand. Use the other hand to adjust the paper into a creased, open chute. Hold it steady so you don't spill any tobacco.









The index finger in the crease serves to stabilize the paper as you add tobacco, and it will also keep tobacco from spilling out the end. This end will become the tip of the cigarette—the part that you light.

, Use your free hand to pinch the tobacco and sprinkle it along the the crease in the paper. Work from one end to the other, starting with the end that you are holding. Transfer the rest of the pile from the rolling surface to the paper. You can roll your cigarette thicker or thinner to taste. The main considerations are whether you can seal the cigarette and how well it pulls. The thicker the cigarette, the harder it will be to close; the more densely you pack the tobacco, the harder it will be to draw the smoke through the cigarette.








If needed, even out the tobacco along the paper to make it consistent. Getting it as level as possible helps the cigarette burn more smoothly. If it is damp or clumped, gently pick apart any lumps with your fingers.
You may wish to leave some hanging over the ends: you can pinch it off later, and it will keep the ends from being too narrow.

, If you plan to use a filter, either insert it now, or leave a tobacco-less space to slip it in later. Make the space exactly as long as the filter. You have several filter options:









Buy a bag of fresh cellulose cigarette filters. You can find these online, at smoke shops, and at certain marijuana dispensaries. These are essentially the same filters that you'd find on a store-bought cigarette.Remove the filter from a store-bought cigarette. If you have store-bought filter cigarettes around, and you don't want to smoke them—or if you just want to practice rolling—you can carefully tear the paper and remove the filter. Lay this filter into your rolled cigarette.
Make your own rough filter. First, tear a thin strip of sturdy paper from an index card or business card. Fold it three times to make a pleat, and roll the rest of the unfolded filter around the folded. It should look like a ""W"" encircled. Make sure that that the folded filter will fit smoothly into the cigarette; you may need to adjust it several times. Keep in mind that this homemade filter will only block the largest particulate matter from entering your lungs., When the cigarette is full of tobacco, it is ready to roll. Keep holding the paper in the same hand, but grasp the other end in the same way—between your middle finger and thumb. Lift your stabilizing index finger from the paper; you you no longer need its support. The paper should rest between the thumb and middle finger of both hands. The tobacco should be evenly spread, except at the very tip where your index finger was.








, Your fingers should form a fairly straight line from one end of the cigarette to the other. Use your thumbs to hold the unrolled cigarette slightly below the underside of your middle fingers. The contour of the fingers should suggest the shape of the cigarette.

, Roll the cigarette between your thumbs and middle fingers. Shape the cigarette: compress the tobacco and try to roll the paper tight. While you do this, gradually apply pressure towards the ends of the cigarette. Try to keep your thumbs and middle fingers parallel.








, Once you have molded the tobacco into the right shape, pull your thumbs downward to align the edge of the paper with the top of the tobacco.








, First, tuck the edge of the paper into the tobacco crease. Apply more pressure with your thumbs, and roll your middle fingers upward. Complete the first rotation: wrap the paper all the way around the tobacco, in the shape of a cigarette, without creasing the bottom of the paper.









The front edge of the paper should tuck snugly behind the tobacco as you begin to roll. This may take a few tries. Just keep moving the front of the paper up and down, and gently push in with the thumbs until it catches.

, Roll the cigarette until only the adhesive end of the the paper remains. Activate the adhesive by licking all the way along the edge of the paper; think of it like sealing an envelope. When the adhesive is wet, roll the rest of the paper until no edge remains. Seal the cigarette by applying even pressure: run your fingers along the length of the cigarette, and gently but firmly press the adhesive until it sticks. Make sure not to bend, tear, or crinkle the paper.








, This will make your cigarette neater, better-looking, and easier to smoke. If loose strands of tobacco are hanging from the ends of your cigarette, they may wind up in your mouth or fall onto the floor.








, Some smokers prefer to lightly twist one or both ends of their cigarettes. Twisting the tip that you light will prevent the tobacco from falling out of a poorly-packed cigarette. Twisting the tip from which you smoke will keep tobacco from sticking to your lips. A filter will do the trick as well. If you like to twist the tips, consider leaving a bit of space at the ends of each cigarette that you roll.








, If you left space for a filter, insert it into the end and tuck the paper around it slightly. If you didn't leave enough space for the filter, use a small, sharp tool—tweezers, a hook, or the tine of a fork—to pull out enough tobacco that the filter fits.








,, You can roll a new cigarette whenever you want to smoke, or you can pre-roll a bunch of cigarettes so that you don't need to do the work in the moment. Some people find the act of hand-rolling to be a useful way to limit their cigarette consumption—it is more difficult to chain-smoke if you have to spend several minutes rolling each cigarette., This simple labor-saving device makes it much easier to roll joints and cigarettes if you don't have the dexterity to do it by hand.Buy a cigarette roller online or at a smoke shop. Follow these steps to use the roller:

, First, open the machine: part the two rolling cylinders to reveal a cavity in the shape of a cigarette. Then, pack the cavity with tobacco – as tightly as you like. When the space is full, close the cylinders. One cylinder should move in and out, and one should remain in place. Hold the machine so that the movable cylinder is closest to you.









Be sure to add a filter now if you want one. Tuck the filter snugly into one end of the rolling compartment.
Remember that the more tightly you pack the cigarette, the more difficult it will be to draw smoke. This especially the case with machine-rolling.

, Tuck the non-adhesive side of a rolling paper into the small gap between the cylinders. The adhesive should face the cylinder that moves. Make sure that the top (adhesive) edge of the paper is perfectly parallel with the top of the rolling machine.








, This motion will pull the paper into the machine. Just before the top of the paper rolls into the cavity, stop turning the machine and thoroughly lick the adhesive. This ensures that the cigarette will stick together.








, Once you have wet the adhesive, keep rolling the cylinders in the same direction so that you cannot see the paper. Roll the machine a few more times to tightly pack the cigarette, then separate the cylinders. Your cigarette should be smoothly-packed and ready to smoke!

, Pick any big strings of loose tobacco off of the top of the roller, but feel free to leave the little pieces, or the pieces that are mostly inside of the closed roller alone.








, Looking at it from the side, opening the scroll would be if the roller on the left moved counterclockwise, and the roller on the right moved clockwise. Closing the scroll would be the vice versa.








, You should feel pressure on the roll, and you should also see the tobacco left on the top get slightly rolled into the space.
Now, with the hinged roller facing toward you, place your thumbs on the hinged roller, supporting the rest of the roller with your palms. Pull the roller towards you, downward. BE CAREFUL. If you are encountering a lot of pressure, you may have overfilled the roller. Open it and remove a bit of the tobacco off of the top of the tobacco that is inside the roller. If you can get the hinged roller to rotate once towards you.








, Check which side has the adhesive, and insert the opposite side into the closed roller, with the adhesive facing toward you (Remember to keep the hinged roller facing toward you). This part can be tricky. Begin to slowly roll the paper into the roller. It can be hard to get the paper to grab on the roller, so keep trying.
Once you get the paper almost all the way into the roller, lick the adhesive. Then, roll the paper into the roller. Give it a couple extra rotations for good luck.








, If everything worked out as planned, you should be done, and should have a cigarette sitting in there nicely.

, Make sure that the tobacco is not too compact, tear it apart lightly so it still forms one connected unit.

,,, It is important not to work with too much pressure of your fingers, but with more of a light pull towards both ends of the cigarette. Make sure you work with a lot of surface of your fingers, this will keep the tobacco from forming more compressed areas.

,, Apply a light pull to both ends of the cigarette with your thumbs, this will make sure the end of the paper that is folded in does not crack or fold. If the paper is not folded in neatly your cigarette will not burn evenly.

,, The amount that normally sticks to your tongue will work just fine.

, This will again prevent crackling or folding the paper.

Proceed to add approximately 20 drops to a brand new cartomizer or atomizer.

, The liquid should be hitting the wall only.Do not try to fill the e-cig tank while it is still connected to the battery; make sure that it is fully disconnected.
New tips will require more e-liquid because they are dry and need to be saturated, this will take at least a full minute.

Pick an e-liquid for your vaping pleasure.,
Create a plan to reduce the nicotine level over time.Every two or three months, adjust the e-liquid you’re using to one with a nicotine level lower than the one you’re currently using.For example, if you’re using an e-liquid with a 16 mg nicotine level, choose an e-liquid that has 11 mg of nicotine.,
Think of the e-liquid as you would the tobacco in a traditional cigarette.",How to Use E Liquid4," For people trying to quit smoking, choose a nicotine level lighter than the amount of nicotine in the cigarettes you typically smoke.Below is a general idea of the e-liquid you should choose based on your usual cigarette:


If you smoke ultra-light cigarettes, pick an e-liquid that has 8 mg of nicotine in it. If you smoked light cigarettes, choose an e-liquid that has 11 mg of nicotine. For smokers who smoked regular cigarettes, choose an e-liquid that has 16 mg. This is often the most commonly chosen nicotine level for e-liquids. For full-flavored cigarette smokers, pick an e-liquid that has 24 mg of nicotine in it. If you smoke unfiltered cigarettes, pick an e-liquid with 36 mg of nicotine.,
Work your way down until you get to the zero nicotine e-liquid. Be prepared for small symptoms of withdrawal as you slowly decrease your nicotine levels.

, Inhale as many drags from the e-cigarette as necessary to have your needs fulfilled. The nicotine in the e-liquid will act as a healthier substitute for traditional cigarettes."

Get an air purifier.,
Do the wash regularly.,
Dust your residence.,

Don’t let anyone suspect you go to smoke.,
Turn the fan on.",How to Smoke a Cigarette Indoors Without Getting Caught2," Air purifiers filter the content and the stench of air, erasing the stink of tobacco smoke. This will help you conceal your smoking when indoors.The best air purifiers will have an activated carbon filter. This filter is specially attuned to remove the odor of smoke.
If you’re out and about but trying to not get caught smoking indoors, use a personal air filter. These portable devices filter your smoke, scrubbing its scent and toxins., Smoke clings to clothes, curtains, towels, and bedding. Remove these things regularly before they build up a heavy layer of smoke that could out you as an indoor smoker., Smoke particulate can mingle with regular dust and settle on your tables, TVs, and counters. Dust and wipe surfaces regularly to avoid accumulating telltale smoke scent.Don’t forget to wipe down your mirrors and windows.

, Don’t leave your cigarettes in the toilet or on top of an open trash can. Wrap your cigarette butts in a damp paper towel to ensure they don’t accidentally ignite the trash can, then throw the whole bundle away., If you’re indoors and head off on your own, have a good pretext. For instance, you might smoke when you’re running documents to another part of your workplace. Smoke only during periods of time when you won’t be missed. Smoking indoors when on your way to your lunch break, for instance, is a good option., If you’re in a room with a fan or air conditioner, turn it on. The movement of air can disperse the smoke, making it harder for others to detect. This will reduce the likelihood you’ll get caught."

These sprays will neutralize the smoky odor without adding a new scent of their own., If you’re smoking at home, you could cook up a mixture to conceal the smoky smell caused by your cigarette. Just fill a large pot with water, one cup of white vinegar, one clove, a few drops of orange oil, and a dash of cinnamon. Bring the pot to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Simmer for 30 minutes. The aromatic mixture will conceal the smell of the cigarette you smoked indoors.If you don’t have all the ingredients necessary to make the pleasantly-scented mix, you could simply boil a cup of vinegar to conceal the cigarette smoke., While this solution is probably difficult to use outside the home, scented candles can conceal – or at least reduce – the amount of detectable smokiness of a given space. There are dozens of scented candle flavors available both online and in big box stores. Choose one you like and light it after you’ve smoked indoors., There is no evidence that any particular air freshener scent is better than any other at obscuring the stink of cigarette smoke.

Always choose or pick pesticide-free herbs when possible. Your base herbs should account for 50 percent of the total herb blend. For base herbs, try full-bodied, smooth herbs like:Damiana
Mullein, an herb that’s good for breathing problems and asthma
Raspberry Leaf
Coltsfoot, which is an expectorant (something that helps you get rid of mucus) but it also is now known to cause liver damage.;
, These will make up about 33 percent of your overall herb blend. There are many herbs you can choose from, and it’s best to play around with the quantities and herbs until you find a recipe that you like. Consider keeping a journal so that when you make a new blend, you can keep track of the ingredients, quantities, and how it turned out. Secondary herbs can include:Blue lotus
Skullcap
California poppy, catnip, and chamomile
Passionflower
Uva Ursi
Hops
Thyme
Lobelia (be warned that this can induce vomiting)
Marigold, Marshmallow, Marjoram, and Mugwort
Wild dagga and wild lettuce

, The herbs that go into this component of your cigarette blend tend to be more potent and flavorful, so they only account for about 17 percent of the blend. Popular flavoring herbs and spices for herbal cigarettes include:Peppermint and spearmint
Sage and thyme
Lavender
Clove
Licorice Root
Stevia
Rose petalsJasmine
GinsengTea leaves

, Look for papers that are raw or as natural as possible: any chemicals or additives in the paper will be burned and inhaled into your lungs. Especially avoid papers that have been bleached or have ink on them. Aside from regular paper, you can also find smoking papers made of flax, rice, and hemp.


If you find hand rolling cigarettes difficult, consider a cigarette roller that helps you shape and pack the herbs. You can use this in conjunction with pre-rolled cigarette tubes,which come in many varieties, including filtered, without filters, and even mentholated.

, Not everybody uses filters for their cigarettes, but there are items available that will filter your smoke. If you are using ready-made cigarette tubes, you can purchase these with a filter on them already. You can also buy reusable filters, or disposable filters that are used with one cigarette.

, Instead of purchasing dried herbs for your cigarettes, you can pick or collect fresh herbs and dry them. This is good because it allows you to control how dry the herbs are (for smoking, you don’t want your herbs so dry that they’re crispy).Tie your herbs in small bundles using twist ties, elastic bands, string, or thread, and hang them upside down for a couple days until they are mostly (but not completely) dry.


For faster drying, spread the herbs out in a single layer on a cookie sheet, set your oven to the lowest temperature, and dry the herbs in the oven. Keep a close eye on them. You can also use a dehydrator to prepare your herbs.
When your herbs are dry, remove any stems, roots, or small twigs that could poke holes in your paper., One ounce (28.3 grams) of herbs will yield anywhere from 24 to 40 cigarettes, depending on how large you make each cigarette.To make larger batches of herb blends, just remember that you want three parts base herb, two parts secondary herb, and one part flavoring herb. To make a one-ounce batch that will roll 24 to 40 cigarettes, combine in a medium-sized bowl:


Half an ounce (14.1 grams) of base herbs
About one-third ounce (9.4 grams) of secondary herbs
About one-sixth ounce (4.7 grams) of flavoring herbs, Mix the herbs with your fingers to mix them together, make them fluffy, and help break up any large bunches.Transfer the blend to a grinder or clean coffee grinder and grind it into a course powder. Make sure you stop when it’s still course, as you don’t want the herb powder being too fine.


Use a pestle and mortar if you don’t have a grinder or coffee grinder.

, If you bought herbs from a store and they were already dry, you will need to add some moisture back so they burn properly.Take your herb batch and spread it out in a thin layer on a cookie sheet, large plate, or parchment paper. Using a mister and clean water, spray a small amount of water over the herbs so that the entire mixture is slightly moist.To prevent mold growth, only add moisture to the portion of herb blend that you are rolling immediately. If you’ve made a larger batch, separate and moisten what you need for immediate use and store the rest in an airtight container.

, When it has had time to dry and the overall consistency of the herb mixture is mostly dry but with some moisture, then it is ready to roll.

, Lay a single paper out on a flat surface. Use your fingers or a spoon to evenly spread the herbs over the center of the paper. For a smaller cigarette, use about 0.025 ounces (0.7 grams) of herbs; for a larger cigarette, use about 0.04 ounces (1.1 grams).


If you are using a cigarette roller instead of rolling by hand, pack your herbs into the filling tray.

, Either pick up the paper or keep it on the flat surface, holding or maneuvering it with your index fingers and thumbs. Gently fold it lengthwise at the one-third mark so all the herbs roll into an even line. Roll the shorter side of the paper up and over the herbs so that the paper envelops them. Pack the herbs into a tight roll and tuck the edge of the paper under the herbs. Roll up the rest of the paper, leaving a small lip at the end.


For the cigarette roller, insert the empty tube and fill it with the packed herbs to create your cigarette.
If you are using a disposable filter that gets rolled into the cigarette, make room for it at one end and roll it up with the cigarette.

, Dampen the lip of the paper that you left exposed to make it sticky. Seal the paper and let it dry out for a couple minutes.

, For reusable and disposable filters that aren't rolled into the cigarette, insert the cigarette into the filter. Otherwise, the filter should already be rolled into the cigarette.

Smoke the cigarette properly.,
Use your fingers to flick a cigarette away.,
Master some bar tricks with cigarette ash.",How to Flick a Cigarette1," You generally want to start out by holding a cigarette somewhere in its filter area. The filter is the portion of the cigarette toward its end that is often a different color from the cigarette itself.Don't inhale the smoke right into your lungs. Think of your mouth as a ""staging area"" for the cigarette. Put your lips around the filter area about 5 mm into the cigarette itself.
The filter end of the cigarette shouldn't extend past your teeth. Draw smoke into your mouth through the cigarette. You will want to periodically flick the ash into an ashtray.
Consider flicking the cigarette away for good when it has burned almost to where the filter starts. You could stop when it burns about 8 and 12mm in. Any closer and you risk burning your mouth.;
, When the cigarette is almost finished, place the butt between your middle finger and thumb.Take the last few puffs of the cigarette, and put it out on a wall, the ground, or the sole of your shoe. It's much safer if you do so. Never flick a lit cigarette as it could cause a fire.
Roll your middle finger over the butt, so that it meets the pad of your thumb, and the butt is wedged between the tip of the thumb and the nail of the middle finger. Hold your little finger and index finger out.
Flick the butt away from you. Moving your arm in the direction you wish to flick the butt, as you flick it, can help it travel further. In contrast, people usually hold their cigarette in between their ring and middle fingers in a gentle manner., Want to impress? How about learning a bar trick instead of just flicking a cigarette.


Light your cigarette. Smoke it to the end without any ash being lost. Here's how: Straighten out a paper clip and put it all the way through the cigarette.
The paper clip will prevent any of the ash from falling off even as the cigarette burns.That trick Clint Eastwood supposedly did on a talk show by flicking a cigarette from his breast pocket into his mouth? It seems to be an urban legend, as the actor reportedly doesn't even smoke."

Gather your looseleaf tobacco and whole cloves.,
Start to prepare the cloves for inclusion.,
Do not worry if the petal-ball breaks in half or thirds - this is actually good.,

If you are using an injector, stay away from the cheap hand held.,
Real clove cigarettes DO NOT use saccharine!",How to Make Clove Cigarettes or Kretek," Depending on how much clove you like, you can do a clove:tobacco ratio of anywhere from 1:3 to 2:3. Any more than that and it will not burn properly. Use Ceylon cloves if you can find them, one source is www.penzeys.com. There is a taste and smell difference.;
, A clove is actually a dried flower. Cut between the sepals (four little points) and petals, which are just the little ball at the end (see diagram). This will usually make a surprisingly clean cut if done with patience and a good sharp paring knife. If you like the exploding end do this, otherwise don't bother

, The characteristic crackling sound of kreteks is actually the petal-ball burning, which is why we try to leave it either intact or in large pieces. It is also where the onomatopoetic Indonesian word ""kretek"" comes from! Coarse grinding the whole clove does a good job, and it still crackles nicely

, Whatever you're using to grind them. As opposed to the petals, we want this part to be ground up finely so that it will burn properly. Djarum Blacks were predominantly ground cloves, a very course grind. An electric coffee grinder ran for about 20 seconds is about perfect

, Here is what the proportions should look like for a 1:3 clove:tobacco ratio.If you are using a table top injector, do not bother pre-mixing, load 1/3 tobacco, a layer of ground clove, then another third tobacco

, However, if you want to flavor the entire mix, which is what most kretek companies do, you will want to proceed to the next few steps.

, So pick your liquid and add it at the ratio of approx. 1:8 liquid:dry ingredients in a bowl. I think I probably usually use about 1:7, but it depends on how strong you want it, how long you want to wait, and what you're using to dry it.

, The dry ingredients will absorb the flavors during this time.

, Mix it up time to time so that it dries evenly. Time to dry varies, but it can be just a little crispy when you take it out.


Another option is to put the mix in a Pyrex/heat-safe bowl in a fondue set. Make sure you stir the mixture more often, as it is hotter and thus dries more quickly. Sounds crazy but it works!
Yet another option is to just let it sit out in the air, but this takes a while.

, Don't be surprised if your mixture darkens after adding a darker liquid. (Not every part in the image is individually labeled. i.e. The petal-balls are labeled, but not all of them. The ground clove is labeled, but not all of it, etc.) Time to roll it up or pack a pipe! Mmm, Enjoy!

, Also on choice of tubes, use a Vera Cruz Nocturne (brown color, almost like a Djarum Special), or a Vera Cruz Midnight (Black almost just like the Djarum Blacks). A sprinkle of ground nutmeg also works to get it closer to the Djarum Blacks. If you really like the sweetness those had dip the filter end in a solution of saccharine water. Saccharine is available at most grocers, in tablet form, just grind up and dissolve, let the cigarette dry overnight before smoking.

, The Filter dip mixture is actually sugar, maple and licorice. Real kreteks do not use any artificial ingredients, and have prided themselves in that aspect.

Consider a butane torch lighter.,
Carry a charged flameless lighter.,
Get a windproof lighter.",How to Light a Cigarette in the Wind1," Torch lighters are wind-resistant. If the weather is cool, keep the lighter in your pocket for several minutes to warm it up. Then locate the adjustment part of the device: it may be a screw, lever or wheel. Rotate the part in the direction of the plus sign to increase the butane level., Flameless lighters use rechargeable batteries. Since they are electronically operated, they don’t require gas or fuel. They typically recharge with an AC adaptor or USB plug. Since there is no flame to blow out, you can still use them in windy weather.

, There are many different types of them on the market. Shop around online or stop in a local tobacco shop. When you find one you like, you may want to read reviews about it first from other people who have tried it, to see if it’s as effective as the seller claims.

Put the cigarette in your mouth.,
Create a flame with your lighter.,
Bring the flame to the tip of your cigarette.,
Inhale while the flame is still touching the tip of your cigarette.",How to Light a Cigarette1," Place the filter end of the cigarette into your mouth. You can hold your cigarette using your index finger and thumb. Another way to hold it is to use your middle finger and index finger.Make sure you put the filter end into your mouth. You can tell because the filter side will often be another color and there will be cotton in that end.
You can put either end into your mouth if you are smoking filterless cigarettes.;
, Hold your lighter with your thumb positioned on the spark-wheel. Flick your thumb down while holding onto the button. Your other fingers should be gripping the body of the lighter.Some lighters will have buttons instead of spark wheels. In this case, do the same thing except press the button with your thumb.
It may be easier to light if you use your dominant hand.

, Continue holding the button on the lighter as you bring it to the tip of your cigarette. Allow the cigarette to lay in the flame.


Holding the flame on a lighter for an extended period of time will make the metal on it incredibly hot because of heat transfer.Stand behind a wall or cup your hand around the lighter to prevent the flame from going out.

, This will cause air to travel through the tobacco in the cigarette, causing it to light. This should only take 2 to 3 puffs to happen. Once the cigarette is lit, release the button on the lighter.


Exhaling through your cigarette will cause a flare up from the flame on the tip of your cigarette."

Open up all windows and doors.,
Wipe the paneling first.,
Wash the paneling.,
Wipe the paneling again using the white wine vinegar.,
Let the air circulate through the room as much as possible.,
If you've tried the above method to no avail, step it up a notch with one or more of the following suggestions.

,
Purchase a product that is a chemical sponge.,
Make up a solution using tri-sodium phosphate (TSP).,
If it is suitable, paint over the cleaned wood paneling.,
Call in a professional if what you've tried does not work.",How to Get Rid of Cigarette Odor from Timber Paneling," Let as much fresh air ventilate the room or area as possible.;
, Use plain white wine vinegar on a cleaning cloth. Wipe this over the entire area of the paneling. This will both lift any marks, stains, grease and other residue from the wood paneling, as well as starting the deodorizing effect.


Note that vinegar has an odor of its own, which isn't considered pleasant by everyone. However, this odor will disappear within a day.

, Use warm soapy water; dip a cleaning rag into it and wipe over the paneling again. Be sure to wash really well. Wipe off any overly wet areas.


Either an all-purpose detergent or a dish-washing detergent are fine for this wash. However, always check an inconspicuous area of the wall first, to ensure that the solution won't stain the wood paneling.
Murphy's Oil soap is another possibility., This round will help to increase the deodorizing effect.

, The more days you can do this, the greater the opportunity for the odor to dissipate.

,, This product will absorb the smoky odor as you clean with it.


Rub the chemical sponge over the wood paneling, being thorough to reach every spot.
Change positions on the sponge when it gets dirty in one area. If any area gets too dirty, cut that area off, as directed by the packaging instructions.
Continue until the paneling is clean and smells better. As with the method above, ensure that the room or area continues to be well ventilated.

, TSP is a degreaser, and this is essential when you're trying to remove the residues from smoking. Add one tablespoon of TSP to one gallon of warm water. Mix together. Wearing gloves, dip a sponge into the mixture, then wring. Wipe the sponge over the wood paneling, reaching all areas. Immediately follow with a new sponge dipped in clean water only (and wrung out), wiping off the TSP. Allow to dry, in good ventilation.


TSP can discolor wood, so test an inconspicuous area first. Do not let the water pool on the wood anywhere, or it will likely discolor it. Always wring out the application rag or scrubbing item well before applying to the wood.

, This will seal in the odors and improve the look. A sealant or gloss can be added as the final layer, firmly trapping in the odors.


A TSP wash is ideal pre-painting, as it will remove the smoke residue and leave a nice, clean surface for painting on.
If painting isn't an option, use a varnish, clear gloss, wood veneer or wood sealant instead. Shellac can be a good sealant but it has strong odors too, so ensure a lot of ventilation until its odors wear off.
Orange or lemon oil can make a good sealant that covers the odor.

, Look for companies that specialize in removing smoke odors and stains after a fire; they will have the tools and chemicals needed to neutralize the cigarette odors.


Get a quote before using the services. These services can be very expensive, depending on what area needs covering and what needs to be done.
Even with a professional service, it may not be possible to remove all of the odor.

Flick a cigarette by flicking the burnt ash into an ashtray.,
Using other finger combinations to ash a cigarette.",How to Flick a Cigarette2," If you smoke, you may want to at least do it with style. Smokers use their fingers to flick ash off a cigarette instead of tapping the cigarette on an ashtray.


You will need to flick the cigarette into the ashtray several times while it burns. You want to flick it when the ash looks like it might fall. Hold the cigarette between the thumb and middle finger.
Lightly tap the cigarette over the ashtray with your index finger. This is how you flick cigarette ashes. The process is sometimes called ""ashing"" the cigarette. As noted, don't tape the cigarette against the ashtray or you will look like a cigarette smoking novice!
Don't tap ash onto carpet or the ground or any surface other than into an ashtray. You could cause a fire.

, There is not one way to ash a cigarette. There are other methods that involve other fingers. Some people believe the way you hold and flick a cigarette reveals your personality.An alternative method is to hold the cigarette between the thumb and index finger. Then, tap the middle finger against the cigarette to ash the cigarette.
You could also hold the cigarette in your index finger and middle finger. Squeeze the cigarette tightly. Use the thumb to flick the filter. This should flick the ash into the tray.

These will help the flame grow and stay lit long enough to light your cigarette.This technique will work for wood matches, not matches with cardboard bodies.

, Hold the matches about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) apart from each other. Keeping them in this position, strike the first match. The second match will light slightly after the first. This will give you extra moments to light your cigarette.

, The flame will have more material to burn at once, making a stronger fire. You should hold the matches at the very tips of the ends, since the flame will travel upward quickly. Be careful not to burn yourself.

Use the tip of someone else’s lit cigarette.,
Use a disposable cup.,
Get a special case.",How to Light a Cigarette in the Wind3," Put your unlit cigarette between your lips. Press the end of the lit cigarette up against the end of your unlit cigarette. Without inhaling, take short, rapid puffs from your cigarette as if you are blowing kisses with your lips, or making short sucking motions on a straw.


Try to keep the two cigarette ends flush up against each other so that you ignite the full tip of your cigarette.
Once your cigarette starts smoking, you can take a couple of deep inhales to get your cigarette fully lit on its own.

, If you have an empty paper cup from a beverage, poke a hole in one side of it, for instance with a pen. You can put your cigarette partway through the hole, and light it from inside the cup. That way the cup is protecting all sides of the cigarette from the wind. Make sure that you don’t actually touch the flame to the cup, since paper is flammable.Activate the lighter with your pointer finger instead of your thumb, so that you can point the lighter downwards into the cup without burning yourself.Make a tear or cut in the side of the cup that reaches down to the hole you made so that you can retrieve your cigarette. You can try to pull your cigarette back out through the hole but do so carefully, as glowing ashes may be knocked loose.

, You can purchase lighter cases online that are equipped with windshields. You can also find pocket ashtrays and lighter cases with built-in electric coils to light cigarettes with. That way the wind will not affect the functionality of the heat source.

Obtain a match from a box or book of matches.,
Drag the match against the striker.,
Bring the match to the tip of your cigarette.,
Inhale through your cigarette.,
Blow on your match to put it out.",How to Light a Cigarette2," Remove the match and hold it with your index finger and thumb. You can pick matches up at most department and convenience stores.


You can purchase strike-anywhere matches, which can be struck on many rough surfaces or safety matches, which can only be struck on the striker provided with the matches.Some stores and bars give away matches for free.

, Holding the match firmly in your hand, strike it against the striker strip that was provided on the side of your box or on the back of your book of matches.


Friction between the striker and the match ignites the red phosphorus that’s on the tip of your match and converts it to white phosphorus., With the match still lit, bring it to the tip of your cigarette. Make sure that the flame is engulfing the end of the cigarette. You can cup your other hand around the match to ensure it doesn’t go out.


Lighting a match is difficult under rainy or windy conditions.

, Inhale through the filter side of your cigarette to light it. Make sure to do this quickly because the match will continue to burn. If your match gets too low, blow it out and try another one.

, Make sure that after you light your cigarette that you fully blow out your match. Leaving a lit or hot match could cause a dangerous fire. You can also shake your hand quickly to put out the flame.

Use a grill lighter as an alternative to the traditional cigarette lighter.,
Turn on your gas stove for a quick flame.,
Use the tip of another person’s lit cigarette to light your own.,
Use a Zippo gas lighter.",How to Light a Cigarette3," Even though they are usually used to ignite a grill, grill lighters make for a quick alternative if you don’t have matches or a traditional lighter. Grill lighters have a long stem and a handle with a button on it.Light your cigarette in the same way you would use a disposable lighter.

, If you don’t have any sort of lighter or match in your house, you can turn on your stove and put your cigarette on it to light it. Turn on your gas stove and carefully place the tip of the cigarette into the flame with your hands. Once the flame starts to burn on the end, try to take a drag from it.


Don’t put your face near the burner or you can burn yourself.
If you smell gas, but there is no flame, put out your cigarette, go outside, and call 911., If you’re in a social situation and there is no lighter or matches in sight, you can use the tip of another lit cigarette to light yours. To do this simply touch the end of the lit cigarette to the end of yours while it’s in your mouth and inhale.


This is also a great way to start a conversation with a stranger.

, Lighting a cigarette with a Zippo lighter is very similar to lighting one with a disposable lighter. Make sure that your lighter has enough fluid. Some Zippo lighters are even wind resistant.Closing the lid on a Zippo lighter extinguishes the flame.

Break your cigarette completely in half.,
Take the filtered end of the cigarette first.,
Pick up the other half of your cigarette.,
Insert the newly twisted end of the cigarette into the hollow tube end of the filtered piece of cigarette.,
Light up and enjoy your cigarette as you normally would.",How to Fix a Broken Cigarette1," Sometimes when cigarettes break, they don't break all the way through. For this method, you'll have to break your cigarette so that it is in two separate pieces. It needs to be in two completely separate pieces because you'll be inserting one piece of your cigarette into the other.






;
, Look for the line where tube of the cigarette ends, and remove any remaining paper or tobacco that is left after that line. This piece should now be just the cigarette filter and tube. Set this piece of your cigarette to the side.







, Start by taking the broken end of the cigarette and removing any loose tobacco. Now, gently twist the end between your fingers – as if you were twisting the wrapper of a tootsie roll – to close it so that no more tobacco falls out. Do not twist too tight, as air will not flow through it.








, Gently twist and nudge the twisted end into the tube so that the two pieces become secured into one. Be gentle while piecing your cigarette together, or you may break it even further.








If you're unable to piece your cigarette back together, don't try to force or shove it into place.
If you're having problems piecing your cigarette back together, it might be time to use a rolling paper to fix your cigarette. See method 2.

, You should be able to smoke it without any complications.

Put out your cigarette.,
Remove the filter.,
Dispose of leftover tobacco.,
Dispose of paper.,An alternative is to flatten the paper and shred it with your fingertips, rendering it even more degradable as even the slightest hint of moisture will cause the fragments to fall apart.",How to Field Strip a Cigarette,";
, Do this by twisting the filter off at the point where it meets the tobacco. The filter should slip out the end. Keep this so that you can dispose of it in a rubbish can later.

, Open up the paper and let the tobacco out. Emptying it over earth or vegetation is not recommended, as tobacco contains many toxins.

, Scrunch up the paper and throw it away. The ball should be so small that it arguably doesn't count as littering, and the paper is biodegradable.

They have several parts that work together, but knowing a bit about how they work together will hopefully help you get the most of out you or your friend's, bong.



Mouthpiece: This is the opening at the end of the tube where you place your mouth. When placing your mouth on the inhale hole, place your lips inside, not over, the hole. Purse them slightly and force them gently into the hole so that the outside of your lips creates an airtight seal.

Chamber: This is where the smoke accumulates, ready to be inhaled. Smoking a bong is a two-part activity -- you fill the chamber of smoke, then ""clear"" it with quick inhale at the end.

Bowl (Slide): This holds your smoking material. It is sometimes called a slide because you remove it from the downstem as the final step before inhaling the smoke in the smoke chamber.

Downstem: A small tube that connects the water in the bottom of the bong to the bottom of the slide. It may be defused (notched at the bottom) or a simple tube. The smoke travels through the downstem and into the water. Some bongs do not have downstems and instead have a molded glass tube leading from the slide into the chamber. The water should always be higher than the downstem.

Carb (Optional): A hole on the side of the bond above the water level, the carb is kept covered while the slide is being lit and then uncovered when the user is ready to inhale the smoke. Most water bongs, however, do not have a carb, unless they are wooden or porcelain.;
, Remove the downstem and fill the chamber with water so that all the holes in the downstem are covered. It should be low enough so that it doesn't spill out of the carb, if you have one. Try to get the water between 1"" and 1/2"" above the end of the downstem. The temperature is a matter of preference-- some people love cold, some warm, and many are fine with room temperature.Contrary to popular belief, more water does not lead to a better experience. It takes your lungs effort to pull air through water, so more water just means you are working harder to pull the smoke through.
Test the amount of water by taking a quick, deep breath through the mouthpiece -- it should bubble up but never come to your lips.

, Percolators, or percs, are small additions in the neck and chamber of the bong that further filter your smoke. They can be branched like trees, circular discs, notched tubes, rounded domes, or a variety of other shapes depending on the glassblower. Their purpose is all the same -- they provide more air and water to diffuse and cool the smoke. Fill the percolator with enough water to cover any air holes with a few millimeters of water.


You may have to fill a percolator through the mouthpiece instead of the downstem.

, Ice will cool down the smoke, which some people believe makes it easier to inhale. Carefully put some in the water to cool it down, removing the downstem first so that the ice doesn't break it on the way down.


Some bongs have ""ice pinches,"" where the glass of the chamber is pinched to allow ice cubes to rest. This forces the smoke to travel around the cold air in the neck, cooling it right before it goes into your mouth.
On the other hand, some smokers prefer hot water in the chamber because the steam helps bring moisture into the lungs. This is a matter of personal preference.

, Breath as if you were smoking the bowl normally, once with the bowl in and once with it removed. Does any water hit your lips? If so you should pour some out. Are all the percs bubbling when you inhale? If they are not, add a bit more water so that you see big, honeycombing bubbles up the sides of the glass as you inhale.

, This is so that you don't accidentally knock the entire thing over while packing.

, First, make sure that enough airflow makes it through the bowl. Gently blow on the bowl, and make sure you can feel air on the other side, where it meets the downstem. If air gets through easily, you're golden. If not, take a pointy tool, like a safety pin or mechanical pencil, and gently unpack any debris that may be lodged in the bowl. The key to smooth, milky smoke is enough airflow.

, Break up your smoking material into small pieces roughly the size of large crumbs. If you're using a grinder to grind up your smoking material, take a look through the smoking material and try to remove any seeds or stems before grinding it up. Seeds, stems, and leafs will compromise the purity of your smoke, so it's best to remove them.


If you do choose to use a grinder you should give it a quick, coarse grind. Finely ground smoking material can get sucked into the chamber and become extinguished before it has time to release its seductive smoke. This is sometimes referred to as ""snapping the bowl.""

, Do not pack it over the top edge, as the smoke will drift away instead of into the bowl. If you have a large hole the bottom of your bowl, break off a bigger piece of smoking material (such as a 4-5mm ""nugget"") and use it to lightly block off the hole. This prevents the herb from sucking into the downstem.


Make sure the bowl is not so full that your smoking material falls out, or so tightly-packed that no air can pass through. You should pack your material to a medium-light consistency. You want to get as much material in your bowl as possible while still being able to pull air through it with each inhale.

, Fit it in snugly, but don't feel like you need to cram it in. Unless you have a carb, you'll need to remove the bowl to smoke from a water bong.

, Most people grasp the bong firmly around the neck, which is made to fit in your hands. The bottom often rests in your lap or on a flat surface. Novice bong users should always follow this rule: Keep the bong on a flat surface (like a tabletop) to minimize the chance of it falling and breaking. More advanced bong users can be seen gripping the bong without any support underneath, but this can lead to accidents if you aren't prepared.


If you can't find a flat surface to hold the bong on, rest the bong on your stomach area or in between your legs if it's big enough.
If the bong has a carb, grip the piece so that one finger plugs up the hole. If you don't, you will draw in outside air, not the air through the burning bowl, and end up with no smoke in the chamber. Make sure you can safely uncover the hole as well.

, It is bad etiquette to wrap your lips around the outside of the mouthpiece. Instead, purse your lips and push them lightly in the inside of the tube. Make sure that the entire opening is sealed, otherwise you won't be able to draw any smoke out.


Practice good bong etiquette by wiping your mouth, drying your lips, and placing your lips inside the inhale hole instead or entirely around it. You'll create a better vacuum and you won't slobber all over the top of the bong, making the next hit unpleasant.

, Strike your lighter with your free hand and slowly tilt it down over the bowl. As you do, begin inhaling so that you ""pull"" the flame into the bowl, igniting your smoking material.


If you don't want to inhale the fumes of a lighter, or simply don't want to deal with the hassle of many moving parts, try lighting hemp wick instead. Also known as ""bee line,"" hemp wick is an organic lighting string that burn slowly and stay lit. You light the end, like a candle, and use this to light the bowl.

, Once the herb is lit, it will start glowing and the bowl will fill with smoke. The key here is to inhale slowly. You don't want to be inhaling your smoking product so much as gathering smoke inside the bong's chamber.


Once the smoking material is lit, it will stay lit as you pull air through it, helping the rest of the bowl catch as well. It should only take 1-2 seconds of direct flame.
Move on when you start running out of breath. You don't want to be completely winded before you inhale the smoke-- you should have one big, quick breath left in your lungs.

, To get the smoke into your lungs, you need to allow fresh air to flow through that pushes the smoke up and into your lungs. Use the hand that held the lighter to pull the bowl out, or remove your finger from the carb. As soon as you do, take a deep, rapid breath to inhale all the smoke in the bowl.


Many beginning smokers struggle to know how much air they have left for this final inhalation. If you are unsure, remove the bowl after the chamber has filled up with smoke, before the smoke gets into the neck.

, There is no real benefit to keeping the smoke in your lungs, as most pleasurable compounds are absorbed instantly.Place the bowl back into the downstem or clean it out if it is finished.

, Many smokers find the left-over smoke ""stale"" and prefer not to smoke it. Instead, blow lightly through the downstem to force the remaining stem up and out the mouthpiece of the bong.


Do not ever exhale back into the top of a bong, as this usually spills the water out the downstem or carb and can wet the bowl, ruining any extra smoking material., The first couple times you hit a bong, it's easy to accidentally drool while you're inhaling. But this is bad smoking etiquette. No one wants to think about drool as they let the relaxing calm of a smoking product take hold. To avoid drooling into the bong, try these tricks:


If you feel drool start to drip out, stop inhaling, put out the bowl with the heel of your lighter and close your mouth. Do this while your mouth is still in its original position, without moving it from the inhale hole. Try to swallow as much drool as possible without exhaling.
Stop inhaling and put the bowl out. Take your mouth from the inhale hole without exhaling and cover the inhale hole with an open palm. Wipe your mouth on your sleeve and try again.

, You're probably among friends, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't keep everything tidy.

, It's rude to smoke all of what's in the bowl if you're supposed to share with other people. Ask the owner of the bong if s/he is packing a ""one-hitter,"" meaning they've only put enough smoking product in for one person. If it is, light the entire bowl. If it isn't you should try ""cornering:""


Focus the flame of your lighter on the side of the bowl, only dipping a little bit of the flame into the bowl.
Leave as much of the top of the bowl unburnt as possible, as this has the best taste. The center and sides will light for you, saving the rest for someone else's ""fresher"" hit.

, Again, no one wants to smoke the dregs, so don't let them. Give the slide back to the person who packed the bowl. They'll either pack a new one or call it quits.

, As the water filters out impurities in the smoke, it will turn tan and smell unpleasant. You should quickly rinse it out and put in fresh water every 7-10 hits, and even sooner for a better taste and cleaner smoke. Frequent rinsing will also make the piece easier to clean later on.

, No matter how often you change the water, your water bong is going to get dirty. Luckily, cleaning a piece is easy, especially if you do it frequently. All you need is some isopropyl alcohol and salt,however you can also invest in cleaning products like Simple Green or Grunge off for a deeper clean. Other home cleaning remedies, mostly used for quick cleanings without large chunks of residue to remove, include:


Vinegar and baking soda
Hot water and denture tablets.

, Use a paper towel to wipe away any big, easily reached pieces of resin and pat all the pieces dry. Trying to clean all the parts of the bong while it is still put together can lead to a heartbreaking accident if a piece slips off.


Try not to dump water out the mouthpiece, as this may bring residue up to the top that you don't want to taste later., Make sure there is enough alcohol to completely cover the surfaces of the pieces, then set them aside to soak.


Whenever possible, use 91% isopropyl alcohol, as it is far more effective than 70% alcohol at removing resin.
If they are very dirty, you should soak the pieces overnight to make cleaning easier.

, Use kosher or coarse grained salt whenever possible, using 2 tablespoons if your bong is larger and a foot tall. Salt is purely an abrasive that won't dissolve in alcohol, allowing you to ""scrub"" the inside of the bong without ever reaching into it.

, The alcohol will weaken the residue and remove the smell, and the salt will scrub away the bits of resin. Use one hand to cover up the top of the piece and another to plug the hole in the stem, then shake the piece to clean it. Think of the salt like a sponge, using it to wipe away any spots or resin. When done, let the piece sit and soak while you take care of the downstem and bowl.

, Letting these pieces soak a little bit will loosen up the resin, since the bowl and downstem are frequently dirtier than the bong. Add some salt to the bag and shake it up just like the bong, trying to get the salt to pass through the pieces.


This is why you should use separate bags for the two pieces, as the shaking can cause them to damage one another.

, Wipe away anything that lingers around, as it should come off easily after the exposure to alcohol. If you are still having trouble, try soaking the pieces overnight and repeating the salt scrub in the morning -- you will usually have better luck., Clean out any salt and alcohol from the pieces and rinse them thoroughly. Set them aside to drive and continue to enjoy them as usual. To make it really sparkle, mix hot water with the juice from half a lemon and shake up the bong to remove water stains., It is much easier and faster to spend 5 minutes cleaning out the bong than an hour trying to dislodge large pieces of resin. Take some time to do a simple salt scrub frequently, once a week if you smoke daily, and you'll be the happy owner of a clean bong for years to come.

Place your broken cigarette in the center of the rolling paper.,
Roll your cigarette in the rolling paper.,
Use only the adhesive section of the rolling paper.,
Smoke your cigarette as you normally would.",How to Fix a Broken Cigarette2," Flat surfaces like counters and tables will make it easier to roll your cigarette in the rolling paper. Rolling papers can be purchased at most gas stations, convenience stores, and smoke shops.

, As you set the pieces of your cigarette onto the rolling paper, push the broken pieces of the cigarette together, so it looks like the cigarette isn't broken. This will allow your cigarette to be rolled and smoked without a problem.







, Tightly wrap your rolling paper around the cigarette so that it holds the broken pieces together as one. Start by folding your rolling paper in half, so that the broken section of your cigarette is covered by the paper.









Proceed to tightly roll your cigarette in the rolling paper. Roll the cigarette in the rolling paper firmly against the table to ensure that you get a tight roll.
Once you reach the end of the rolling paper, lift up your newly rolled cigarette and lightly lick the paper. Then press the end of the rolling paper down so that it stays in place., You also have the option to use only the adhesive part of a rolling paper, as opposed to the entire rolling paper if you'd like. Using only the adhesive is nearly identical to using the entire rolling paper. Some people prefer their cigarettes to have less paper, which is why this is an option.









Piece your cigarette together, place the broken section of the cigarette on the adhesive of the rolling paper, wrap the paper over the cigarette like a cast, and lick it in place to secure.

, The rolling paper will hold your cigarette together like it's brand new. You should be able to smoke your entire cigarette without a problem.

Remove the end of the push pin when necessary.",How to Refill a Lighter1," Turn your lighter upside down. There will be a small hole in the bottom with a slit leading to a small hole. Insert a push pin into the hole, flip the lighter so the pin is resting against your work surface, and press down on the lighter firmly.You should feel and hear a small ""pop"" as the pin pushes a metal beebee out of place. This beebee seals the release valve and must be pushed out of the way.
To verify the beebee seal has been removed, with the push pin still inserted, shake the lighter. You should be able to hear the beebee rattle around.;
, This should only be done with empty lighters. Point the lighter away from your face and remove the push pin. You should hear a puff of air when the pin pulls free.Attempting to purge a lighter that has fuel remaining inside will cause fuel to be sprayed out of the refill valve.
To prevent fuel from getting on your work surface, lay down a cover, like newspaper or a drop cloth.
Wipe down any areas exposed to fuel with a water dampened rag. Also, your hands may have gotten fuel on them. Wash them with soapy water.

, It isn't likely that your butane applicator will fit perfectly into the lighters refill valve. This can cause gas to leak. Slip three rubber grommets that fit snugly onto the applicator.

The rubber of the final grommet should extend just slightly beyond the tip of the butane spray applicator.
Circular rubber grommets can be purchased at your local hardware store in variety packs in the hardware section., Turn the lighter upside down so its bottom faces upwards and its top rests on your work surface. Insert the grommet covered tip of the applicator into the refill valve. Press down on the bottle to disengage the refill bottle's release valve.Because of the seal formed by the rubber grommets, you shouldn't hear any noise as the lighter refills.
The lighter should refill completely in about five seconds. When finished, release pressure on the refill bottle but keep the applicator inserted in the refill valve., Remove the applicator from the refill valve and quickly seal the valve with your thumb. Hold the valve tightly with your thumb and pick up the push pin with your free hand. Quick as you can, remove your thumb and plug the hole with the push pin.

You may hear some hissing when your thumb is plugging the refill valve. Hold your thumb firmly to reduce the escape of fuel.
This part of refilling a disposable lighter can be difficult at first. Move quickly to prevent freshly replenished fuel from escaping., If you've used a push pin with a contoured plastic end, this may get caught on something and pull the pin out. Cut the contoured plastic at its base with clippers and file down any jagged edges with a metal file."

Make sure Your lighter has fluid and a flint.In order for the wick to light on your Zippo, you have to ensure that it is full of fluid and that there is flint in place, otherwise you’ll flick the wheel without any result.,
Hold the lighter properly.,
Slide your thumb up the side of the lighter.,
Strike down on the wheel with your thumb.,
Close your Zippo.",How to Flick a Zippo Lighter1,"


Buy a can of Zippo lighter fluid. Make sure its liquid and not an aerosol.Remove the lighter and cotton by holding the lighter casing and pulling out by the chimney. On the bottom is a piece of felt that you will lift up to pour the fluid into. Once you see the top of the cotton is damp, stop filling.
Let the cotton soak for a minute, then replace the chimney back in its casing.;
, Your Zippo should be closed and you should be holding it so that the hinge is facing your index finger. Everyone will hold a Zippo a little differently based on the size of your hand, but position it so you can easily open the lid with your thumb.


It’s best to hold the Zippo toward the top of your hand and not in your palm.
Try holding your lighter in your forefinger and middle finger while you curl your ring finger slightly, resting the bottom of the Zippo on your ring finger.

, It’s easiest to slide your thumb up the side of your Zippo that’s opposite the side with the hinge.









To make it easier to open the lid of your Zippo, pull your forefinger away so its not blocking the lid and preventing it from opening.

, Simply slide your thumb downward quickly to turn the wheel which will strike the flint, resulting in the wick catching the flame.









Depending on how windy it is, or how full your lighter is, you may have to strike down a couple of times before the flame catches

, You can close your Zippo lid several ways.









Use your forefinger to knock the lid back down.
Hold the base of Zippo between your thumb and forefinger and flick it towards the back of your hand with your wrist to force the lid closed.

Ensure that it isn't shattered.,
Look for rust, debris, or dirt.,
Check the fuel tank.,
Look to see if there is a spark.,
Check to see if the flame is small, burns out, or isn't present at all.",How to Fix a Lighter1," If you broke the plastic part of your lighter then you'll need a new one. The pressure is compromised and you won't be able to use it anymore.;
, If you've left a lighter outside for a long period of time the metal wheel on top might be rusted in place. If it won't spin, it won't light. If there is only dirt and debris inside the lighter you might be able to clean it out with your fingers or a pipe cleaner and get it going again. , Luckily the most common problem with these lighters is their incredibly small fuel tank. When this no longer holds enough fuel or enough pressure, it needs to be refilled. The most prone to mechanical and/or internal failure would be the non-reusable Bic lighters.

, If there is no spark, that means that there is no flint. The flint is the piece of equipment that the wheel rubs against to create a spark. The spark lights the fuel and gives you a flame, so the flint is extremely important.

, If the flame burns out then you could be running out of fuel. However, if you just recently bought the lighter there might be an issue with the fuel reaching the spark.

"
"
Hold the lighter upright in your dominant hand.,
Roll the metal sparkwheel down into the red ignition button.,
Hold the red button to keep the flame going.",How to Flick a Bic Lighter1," Curl your fingers around the body of the Bic to keep it steady. Rest the edge of your thumb on the red button so that it is touching the serrated metal sparkwheel. Find a grip that feels comfortable. You may need to experiment with your thumb at several angles before you get it right.This red button is the ignition button that releases the gas from the lighter chamber.
Grip the lighter at least half an inch below the metal portion. The metal gets really hot and you're also more likely to get burned the closer you are to it.;
, Use your thumb. Apply some force to the wheel, as you push it downward, to ensure that you create a spark. Turn the sparkwheel in one quick, decisive motion. If you do it right, a flame come out from the top of the lighter.


You won't see the spark. The spark is generated inside the metal housing of the lighter.

, After you roll the sparkwheel, your thumbnail should rest firmly on the button. As long as you hold this tab, you are releasing a steady stream of gas from the inner chamber of the lighter. The gas feeds the flame and keeps it burning evenly. As soon as you release the button, the flame will cease.


Don't keep the lighter lit for more than 30 seconds. Let off the gas right after you light the object that you're trying to light. The top of the lighter will get hot rather quickly, which can be dangerous.
To get maximum life from your lighter, avoid burning it for any longer than necessary. Most lighters come with plenty of flint to outlast the fuel in normal use, so it is better to relight it than to keep it burning between tasks: e.g. lighting a great many candles. It's unlikely that the flint will run out before the fuel does. When it does run out of gas, you're out of luck.

Pick a brand.,
Consider menthol cigarettes.,

Know when NOT to pack your cigarettes.,
Use a good lighter.,
Light the cigarette.,
Smoke unrushed.,
Inhale your cigarette.,
Exhale the smoke.,
Ash properly.,

Don't gesture with the cigarette.,
Ask before you light when on someone else's property.,
Manage your butts responsibility.",How to Enjoy a Cigarette," Often, a beginning smoker chooses lights or ultra lights. This is recommended as the nicotine content is usually in lower in light and ultra light cigarettes. Once you have a handle on how to smoke properly, try scaling yourself up to regulars. Many claim this will give you a better experiences because of the increased nicotine and fuller flavor. The only way to find out which brand you like the best is to try a variety. Experiment with it.Some of the most popular and highly rated brands include: Marlboro, Camel, Lucky Strike, Newport, and Pall Mall.Taste is somewhat subjective. You may find you dislike the taste of Marlboros but enjoy the taste of Camels. Therefore, you may have to try some trial and error before you find a brand of cigarette that's truly enjoyable for you.;
, If you find the taste of regular cigarettes harsh, consider switching to menthols. Menthol cigarettes contain a non-tobacco additive that creates a minty taste when inhaled. Most major brands of cigarettes, like Camels and Marlboros, carry a menthol variety.If you do not like mint-flavored foods and drinks, you are unlikely to like menthol cigarettes. They carry a very strong mint flavor.
If you've smoked regular cigarettes in the past, you may not like menthols. Many people who have acquired a taste for natural cigarettes strongly dislike menthols., Cloves are a common spice used in cooking and baking. Cloves can be infused with tobacco to create a flavored cigarette.If you dislike the taste of menthols and regular cigarettes, cloves can be a good in-between option. The added flavor can make them taste harsher than a regular cigarette. However, the taste is far more mild than the taste of a menthol.
Cloves can be very strong, so be careful when smoking them. As they can leave you somewhat lightheaded, it's not a good idea to smoke a clove when driving., If you're looking for a particular taste, there are a wide variety of flavored cigarettes on the market. Cigarettes come in flavors like cherry, chocolate, orange, mango, and so on. Flavoring is fairly self-explanatory. Cigarettes are designed to taste similar to the flavor on their label. Flavored cigarettes can be a good option if you dislike regular cigarettes but also dislike cloves and menthols., Most brands of cigarettes benefit from a good packing. Packing your cigarettes will ""tighten"" the tobacco, resulting in a slower burning cigarette. Before opening the plastic film around your pack of smokes, smack the pack filter-side down onto the heel of your palm rapidly for roughly 10 to 20 seconds., Some cigarettes, American Spirits, for example, are already packed with tobacco. American Spirit actually suggests unpacking their smokes by rolling the cigarette between your fingers, filter to end, so that a pinch or so of tobacco comes out. Clove cigarettes also shouldn't be packed., Bic dollar-lighters are cheap and work fine, but they do not give the same satisfaction as using a classic Zippo style lighter. Not only do the first drags of the cigarette taste different with a better lighter, but you will learn to love and cherish your lighter if it's of a higher quality.

, Hold the filter end of the cigarette to your lips. Light your lighter and hold the flame just bellow the end of the cigarette. Puff the cigarette by inhaling gently into your mouth. Do this until the whole end of the cigarette is glowing and lit. You can rotate the cigarette as you light it if it isn't evenly lit., When smoking, be sure that you are not rushed, that you will not be bothered, and that you are either alone or with people you like. This will allow you to enjoy your smoking time that much more, especially if you have smoker friends with you., When putting a cigarette up to your lips, it should not pass your teeth. There are many ways to get tobacco smoke into your lungs. The most common way to do this is to rid your mouth of air, put the lit cigarette up to your lips, then suck air into your mouth (not into your lungs), hold the smoke there for a second, then inhale normally, through your mouth, drawing the smoke (which has now cooled) into your lungs.When inhaling be sure to bring your tongue up to nearly touch the butt of the cigarette so that any smoke has to pass along your tongue. This will allow you to taste your cigarette, and allow you to understand the difference between good and bad cigarettes.
Some recommend wetting your lips with your tongue slightly before putting the cigarette to your mouth, so the cigarette doesn't stick to your lips., After inhaling, keep the smoke in your lungs for a short while then exhale. Smoking a cigarette is not like smoking marijuana; you will not get high from inhaling and waiting until you nearly pass out to exhale. Instead, breathe in normally lung capacity, hold it for a moment, then exhale., The cigarette should be ashed whenever the ashes get to the length of about a 1/4"" inch or more. There's no precise length at which one should ash a cigarette, so use your best judgment. Ash the cigarette in an ashtray if available. To ash, tap the cigarette lightly on the ashtray, or if outside and not near an ashtray, shake the cigarette swiftly with your fingers.


Don't aggressively flick your ashes away., Once the cigarette is down to just before the filter, extinguish it. When outside, throw the butt down near you, and step on it, twisting your foot on top of it before removing your foot to ensure it has gone out completely. When putting a cigarette out in an ashtray, hold the cigarette vertically, lit end down. Push and grind the cigarette into the tray until there's no sign of glowing heat. Make sure to throw the cigarette in a trash can if outside. Do not leave it on the ground.Don't keep smoking the cigarette once it gets closer to 8mm to 12mm close to the filter. The smoke will get hot at that point.

, Hold the cigarette between your index and middle finger, somewhere on the filter. Exactly where to hold it depends on what's comfortable for you. Be wary of the lit end of your cigarette when holding it idly. It is considered bad etiquette to burn someone or something with your cigarette., If you have to point or gesture toward something while talking, you use your other hand. The hand holding the cigarette should be relatively still except when bringing the cigarette to and from your lips., If you're in someone's backyard, or in their car, don't light a cigarette without asking. If someone doesn't want you smoking on their property, be respectful of this., Don't throw cigarettes into trash cans without fully extinguishing them, as that's a fire hazard. Don't thoughtlessly throw finished cigarettes onto the ground. That is littering. Your finished cigarette should be extinguished into an ashtray or hard surface, and then thrown away."
"
Gather your materials.,
Insert a pushpin into the valve at the bottom of the lighter.,
Make sure the lighter is completely empty.,
Prepare the nozzle of the butane container.,
Fill the lighter with butane.,
Remove the butane container and immediately cover the valve with your thumb.,
Insert the pushpin back into the hole in the valve.,
Cut off the top of the pushpin with metal snippers, if you want.This is purely cosmetic, since it would look a little strange to have a pushpin sticking out the bottom of your lighter.",How to Put Lighter Fluid in a Lighter1," You can refill a bic lighter fairly easily with a pushpin. If you want to save money on new lighters, you can use this method and keep one Bic lighter for a long period of time. In order to refill a bic lighter, you will need some butane, a pushpin, and three rubber grommets. You can purchase butane and grommets at most hardware stores. You may also want to have a pair of clippers and file on hand, as you may want to file down the pushpin after you fill the lighter., If you turn the lighter upside down, you will see a small circular indent on the bottom. This is the lighter valve, which needs to opened with a pushpin for you to refill the lighter. Place a pushpin in the hole and then place the base of the pin on a hard surface like a table. Push down. This should open the bottom of the lighter. You can now remove the pin. 







, Some fluid may spray out when you remove the pin. You want to make sure you empty any excess fluid before refilling the lighter with fresh butane.







, When you remove the lid of the butane container, there should be a small nozzle on top. You need to prepare the butane container's nozzle for use. Rubber grommets are small circular rubber devices with a hole in the middle, shaped sort of like a donut. Take your grommets and place all three of them over the nozzle of your butane container. The rubber should come just past the tip of the nozzle. The grommets keep excess butane from spilling out when you refill your lighter.







, Hold the lighter upside down. Place the nozzle of the butane container into the hole at the bottom of the lighter. Then, gently push down on the butane container.








The rubber will muffle the sound so you may not be able to tell that the lighter is being filled, but it is.
Wait about 5 seconds. That's about how long it takes the lighter to fill.

, Once you've filled the lighter, you need to remove the butane container to keep it from overflowing. The fluid will spray out if you don’t cover the hole, so place your thumb over the hole as soon as you remove the nozzle.







, Do this as fast as you can to prevent butane from spilling out. This will remain in the valve to seal it. You will be unable to reuse the factory valve, so you'll have to use a pushpin to seal it.







, It can also be a bit cumbersome to store the lighter if the full pushpin is attached. You can file down the edge of the pushpin, too.

If you think that flicking a Zippo has a place in looking cool, there are several classifications which might feel appropriate.


Rockabilly
Punk
Greaser
Grunge;
, Consult a style guide appropriate to your idea of cool if you’re drawing a blank here, or think of pop culture icons that appeal. Don your leather jacket, skinny jeans, studded denim, or oversized flannel, and express your coolest self.


If you’d like to embody the 50s greaser ideal, for example, look to James Dean for inspiration, or Grease’s Danny Zuko (John Travolta) and Sandy Olsson (Olivia Newton-John).
You can’t ignore the coif! Your hair needn’t adhere to the trendiest cut, but it can’t be ignored. You need to consider your appearance from head to toe.
It’s a good idea to bone up on some basic facts appropriate to these subcultures. Dressing punk and then not knowing where to take the conversation when someone mentions Sid Vicious is most assuredly uncool. , The particular ‘tude you present to the world will depend on your personality and what you, personally, aspire to be. Presenting oneself as aloof is a way to cultivate an aura of cool, but take care not to mistake disregard for others for aloofness. Instead, try to avoid become bogged down by negativity and minor concerns, and present a calm, collected exterior to the world.


While aloof is often synonymous with cool, others may find true passion to be cooler. You can’t fake passion—and really, you’re never be as cool as you can be if you feel like you’re faking who you are—but maybe don’t be so cared of expressing and pursuing your passion, whether it’s music, drawing, computer programming, scriptwriting, performing comedy, automotive repair, or anything else! You can be trendy in addition to everything else you are.

, If you’re old enough to decide for yourself, it’s certainly your own right to decide whether you smoke or not. Know that you don’t need to smoke to carry and cooly use a Zippo, however—providing a light for others, especially those you’re romantically interested in, can make quite a mark.


If worst comes to worst, you can always light candles with your Zippo, though we’ll make no claim that you will look cool in any capacity while doing this. But hey—you do you.

, You’re decked out in cool apparel now, but there’s a pretty integral piece of gear you’ll need to look cool while lighting a Zippo. That piece of gear is—you guessed it—a Zippo.


The flip-top and wind-resistant flame are what make a Zippo unique among lighters.You have plenty of options when it comes to lighters on the market, but for our purposes you’re specifically trying to look cool with a Zippo, after all.

, Lighter fluid will evaporate after a week or so of non-use, so you’ll likely need to refill your lighter if it’s been more than a week since you used it. If it’s new it will likely be full, but it’s a good idea to pick up some Zippo lighter fluid ahead of time—you’ll be replenishing it often.


Take care to wash your hands after handling fluid, and ensure that lighter fluid didn’t soak into any of your clothes before lighting your Zippo.
The wick can also require occasional maintenance. If all you can see is charred and black, pull it up with a pair of tweezers and trim the scorched part., Grip it with your index and middle finger on the top and your thumb on the bottom, with the hinge away from you.

, Both index and middle finger should move down towards your thumb, then take its place so that they’re holding the lighter on the bottom. Your thumb, meanwhile, will slide around to the Zippo’s frontside, near the flint wheel.


This is the tricky part, so don’t be discouraged if you send the lighter flying a few (dozen) times in the process. It will take practice and some intense snapping, but if you do it right it'll open.
With practice you’ll be able add a little more flair to the motion, flicking your wrist as flip open the lighter.

, Quickly spin the flint wheel with your thumb. You’ll eventually be able to work this all into one, smooth motion, where the flame seemingly sprouts out of the open Zippo instantaneously.

, Zippos can produce a hotter, bigger flame, so take care if you’re accustomed to other lighters. Their wind-resistant nature also means you won’t necessarily have to cup the flame to protect it, but whether you want to still do this or not is up to you. This is about image, after all.


When lighting a cigarette for someone else, take care not to press the flame too close to the smoker’s face. Hold the flame out close enough so that it’s convenient for them, but allow the smoker to comfortably lean in toward the flame themselves.

, You have two options available to you for closing the lighter, but the slickest method is undoubtedly to flick it closed. Take firm hold of the lighter’s base with the hinge away from you, and snap your wrist toward you. This should snap the lighter closed without requiring you to touch the top.


The other option available is to simply push it closed with one finger. Simply place your index finger against the Zippo’s hinge, then thrust it upward to snap to top back into place.

, Yeah, yeah, practicing in the mirror doesn’t feel cool. But the goal of looking cool will take a little legwork—direct your attention to the makeover montage in any movie for proof of this rule. Besides, taking the time to really put in the work to achieve something you want, even something as slight as “looking cool with a lighter,” is undoubtedly cool.


In order to become an actor, Henry Winkler worked hard to overcome his dyslexia. This eventually led him to portray an enduring icon of cool, Arthur “Fonzie” Fonzarelli of notable ABC 70s sitcom Happy Days. , Whipping your Zippo around indoors, or idly flipping it on and off without any need for it won’t make you cool: it will make you look obnoxious. So stay calm! The opportunity will arise, and when it does, demonstrate your new skill without drawing particular attention to it. Appearing cool requires the appearance of effortlessness, regardless of how much work you put into it.


The term in Italian is “sprezzatura,” a word that refers to the “studied carelessness” one exerts in order to allure and appeal. Embody sprezzatura.

, The motto of the U.S. Coast Guard is Semper Paratus, meaning “always ready,” and guess what—it’s your motto now, too. If you don’t keep your Zippo lighter on you at all times, you won’t be able to display your proficiency with it! Make it a part of your routine when you’re readying to leave your home, and keep it near your keys or wallet to help you remember.

, Not just cosmetically clean (though that’s a fine idea for pretty much everything a person owns) but mechanically. The flint wheel in particular can collect little bits of debris and flint, which will make it more difficult to light.Periodically clean the wheel with a small, soft brush.

, Without being overeager, keep that Zippo in an easily accessible pocket. If a friend, new acquaintance, or stranger whom you’d very much like to leave an impression upon needs a light, patting yourself down for fifteen seconds before producing it isn’t exactly the smoothest move.

, Smoking is an addictive, health-adverse habit. If you’re of age (18 in most U.S. States) then the decision whether you’d like to smoke is up to you, but know that your decision shouldn’t be informed by a desire to look cool. There’s nothing cool about the myriad cancers which smoking contributes to. "

You don't want to go camping and burn your hand lighting a fire because you used the wrong one.;
, The flame should be about an inch tall. Too big, and you might accidentally light something you don't want to like your friend. Too small, and you'll have a hard time lighting a fire or a cigarette.

, You want one where it is easy for you to use, but not your children. You don't want one to hard to use that you use all your energy trying to get the flame just to come out.

, You want a smooth, not slippery texture. Too rough of a texture, you'll cut your hands. Too slick of a handle, the lighter will fall out of your hand. Make sure you can firmly grip it.

Remove the case screw.,
Loosen the outer seam of the case with a screwdriver.,
Pry open the case.,
Remove the lighter insert.,
Disassemble the new disposable lighter.,
Replace the old lighter's jet with the one from the reservoir.,
Reinsert the replacement reservoir.",How to Refill a Lighter2," There should be a single screw holding the case of the lighter together at the opposite end from the stem. Unfasten this with a screwdriver, then turn the case over and tap it against your work surface to remove the screw from its hole., The outer seam of the lighter will be held together by a light glue and some plastic pins. Run a normal sized flat head screwdriver along the outer seams to loosen the glue., After the seams have been loosened, work the tip of your flat head into the seam and gently pry open the stem-opposite end. When roughly half of the case separates, remove the screwdriver., Pull apart the stem-opposite side of the case open with your fingers. Don't pull too hard; the case should only pry apart halfway. At this point, you should be able to use your fingers to pull out the fuel reservoir.

The fuel reservoir looks very similar to a standard disposable lighter. Place the reservoir and a fresh disposable lighter side by side in front of you.
The empty long-stemmed lighter can be set off to the side. This part won't be needed until you put the lighter back together., Pry the vented front metal band (the wind guard) from the lighter with your fingers. Pull out the flintwheel, the attached flint, and flint spring. Then pull the insert below (which includes the button), its spring, and the nozzle jet free.

After these parts have been removed, keep the disassembled lighter positioned upright to prevent it from spilling fuel., The top of the reservoir should have a similar button-insert as the new lighter. Remove this, its spring, and the nozzle jet from the reservoir. Replace the reservoir jet, spring, and insert on the new lighter.

The jet and the spring should fall into place easily. Press the button-insert into place with moderate force. You should feel it snap into place., Pry open the case halfway one more time. Insert the replacement reservoir into the body of the lighter so the reservoir button and the trigger of the lighter align. Test the lighter. If it lights, refasten the case screw and you're done.

If the lighter does not ignite, it's likely the reservoir button-insert, spring, and/or jet were not correctly installed.
The reservoir should slot into place in a small, internal cavity inside the handle of the long-stemmed lighter."

Purchase butane to refill your lighter.,
Select a flat, sturdy surface to work on.,
Purge your lighter.,
Set the flame height adjuster on the lighter to the lowest level.,
Shake the can of refill fluid.,
Secure the tip of the refill bottle into the refill valve on the lighter.,
Fill the lighter for about five seconds.,
Set the desired flame height.,
Test the lighter.",How to Refill a Lighter3," You can find refill cans almost anywhere you can purchase cigarettes or cigars, like a tobacco store. Look for bottles that come with metal tips instead of plastic ones. Metal tips are better for inserting the butane into the lighter.Verify the butane works with your lighter by reading its label instructions. Always follow the safety directions on the canister to achieve the best results.
Select a high-quality butane specifically intended for butane lighters. Low-quality fuel may not light as well.

, You'll also want this to be in a place that is well ventilated. You’ll be dealing with flammable gas while refilling. Good ventilation will prevent the buildup of harmful fumes.


Your kitchen or an outside area are good places to refill your butane lighter because both are open spaces.
Open a window or turn on a vent in the room if it is available. If airflow is still poor even with a window open, use a stationary fan to improve circulation.
Remaining fluid or gas may spray onto your work surface while refilling. Protect your work surface with a layer of newspaper or a drop cloth., Release the air and remaining fuel inside the lighter. While holding the valve so it's pointed away from your face, push down on the refill lever with a screwdriver.The air will be fully released when you no longer hear a hissing sound.








The refill lever is also sometimes known as the nipple. It is located on the bottom of most butane lighters and usually looks like a small hole with a tiny, circular valve inside.
If you don't have a screwdriver, use a pen, paperclip, or similar tool to push down the valve and release remaining air in the lighter.
If lighter fluid sprays onto your hands or tools, rinse these thoroughly in soap and water. If you forget to do so, the fuel may ignite and burn you when you test the lighter.

, The flame height adjuster is usually on the bottom of the lighter and looks like a screw with a flat head screwdriver slot. Use a small flat head screwdriver and turn the screw clockwise to lower the flame.









By turning the adjuster to its lowest setting, even if you accidentally ignite the lighter, the flame will be small and unlikely to do harm or damage.
Some lighters may indicate the minimum setting direction with a minus sign ( - ). Turn the adjuster screw towards the minus sign to lower the flame., If you have an older can especially, give it a few shakes up-and-down. Over time, the fluid can sink to the bottom and not spray effectively. By shaking the can, you'll prime it for refilling.









While shaking the can, you'll also be able to feel fluid swish around inside it. This will give you a chance to gauge how much is in the bottle.
Nearly empty bottles may not have enough fluid to fully refill your lighter and should be swapped out for a new can of replacement fuel., Make sure you are holding the lighter and refill bottle straight up and down. In some cases, the bottle tip may not form a secure fit with the lighter's valve. In this situation, use a tip adapter.


Most butane refill bottles come with an adapter, so before you try to refill, make sure the standard tip fits over the valve.
Don’t fill the lighter at an angle. This will let air into the lighter tank. Air in the lighter will cause the lighter to not work properly. It will have to be drained and refilled., Pressing the lighter down onto the bottle will disengage the release valve on the bottle's nozzle. Press down on the lighter firmly for about five seconds to refill the lighter.








After filling, if you feel like your lighter isn’t full, repeat this procedure for another five seconds. Refill cans low on fuel may take more time to refuel lighters.
Some lighters have a fuel level that you can check. Check the butane level viewer if you have one to gauge the lighter's fullness.
Lighters that are filled up too much will overflow. This can be dangerous, as butane can leak and catch fire when lighting.

, Flip your lighter over and reset the adjuster to its starting position. Ideally, the flame should be about 1 to 1 1⁄2 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) tall. Before attempting to test the lighter, let the butane settle for a few minutes.









Once you’ve refilled and set your flame height, give your lighter a minute or so to absorb the butane.
As you wait for butane to be absorbed, check your lighter for leaks. Wipe up leaked fuel with a dampened rag. Rinse the rag frequently.
If your lighter leaks, you may have to purge the fuel and refill it again. Check for obvious culprits first, like loose fasteners, before purging and refilling., If there are any spills or if you smell even a hint of fumes, wait a few more minutes for these to dissipate. Hold the lighter at a safe distance from your face and ignite the flame. You may need to add more butane if the flame does not catch or seems weak.









In most butane lighters, butane won't dissolve over time. Always test your lighter before refilling it to make sure that it is empty.

Rest the middle finger of your snapping hand on the edge of your Zippo.Here, you want to position your thumb and middle finger like you’re about to flick something.,
Flick the lid of the Zippo open.,
Snap the flint wheel.,
Close the lid.",How to Flick a Zippo Lighter2," For this method, you will need to .


Hold your Zippo in your off hand so that the hand that can snap the best is free.
Hold your Zippo between your index finger and thumb and position it so that the lid is unobstructed.

,


Think of it like you’re about to flick a quarter to spin it. Or, like you’re flicking a paper football.

, Flick your Zippo open with your middle finger. If done with enough force, your fingers should be extended, and your hand should be forming a “4” symbol.








, Now quickly position your middle finger and thumb on the wheel and snap downward.









Rest the edge of your middle finger on the very top of the wheel.
Simply snap your fingers normally, don’t try to do anything special. If you snap correctly, the momentum will have enough force to spin the flint wheel and ignite the wick.
It may take a few snaps before you successfully light your Zippo, especially if you’re new to the trick.

, When you are done, close your lid with your middle finger, or in any other manner you wish.









You can snap your lid closed by flicking your wrist forward and downward toward the ground. Just make sure you have a tight grip so you don’t drop it.

Make sure you haven’t just filled your Zippo.,
Hold your Zippo in your primary hand.,
Strike the Zippo downward, making contact with your thigh.,
Roll the flint wheel across and upward off your thigh.,
Close the lid.",How to Flick a Zippo Lighter3," This trick can be very dangerous and you should only try it if you are very confident in your ability. You want to make sure that you have fluid, but that your Zippo isn’t freshly filled and dripping lighter fluid.


If your wick is too wet or your Zippo is leaking, the fluid could spill onto your pants and when you light your Zippo, the extra fluid could catch fire, and be extremely dangerous.

, It’s best to do this trick with the hand that you feel most comfortable with. Hold the Zippo with the hinge facing toward your index finger.


You want to hold your Zippo between your thumb and forefinger with the lid sitting enough above your hand so that it can open the lid fully without being blocked.

, This should be a swift motion so that the lid of your Zippo can make contact with your thigh and kick open.









You want to strike the lid on the edge of your thigh so you can get the lid open without causing so much force that you snap the hinge.
The presser of the lid on your thigh is actually causing it to stay in place, while the momentum of your hand keeps the part of the Zippo in your hand moving, causing the lighter to open.

, In one fluid motion, you want to make contact with your thigh and the wheel, then run it along your thigh to make the wheel turn while very quickly lifting the lighter off your pants so that the flame doesn’t catch any fabric.









Think of it like rolling a toy car across your thigh, and then quickly flicking your wrist upward as if the car has suddenly taken flight.

, Once you have completed your trick, close your lid by snapping it forward and down with a flick of your wrist.

Refuel your lighter.,
Replace your flint on a butane lighter.,
Replace your flint on a Zippo lighter.,
Remove the metal that surrounds the flame hole if it is small or burns out.",How to Fix a Lighter2," To do this for most lighters you'll need to buy a butane can. You can buy one of these at your local hardware store. Make sure you bleed all of the remaining fuel out of your lighter first. Turn the lighter upside down with the fill valve facing upwards. Put pressure on the fill valve and keep the lighter away from your face and away from anything flammable. Make sure the butane can nozzle fits in the hole in the bottom of the lighter. It has to fit in the upright position with the lighter on top of can. You'll want to insert the nozzle then flip the whole contraption upside down so that the lighter is under the can. Now apply pressure until you feel the metal of the lighter get cold. That means you've successfully gotten the butane inside.
For a Zippo lighter you'll have to buy Zippo lighter fluid from the Zippo online store.Keep in mind, it's probably just easier to buy a new lighter unless you are attached to your current one.

, The flint is the piece of equipment that creates the spark. It's tiny black cylinder about a quarter inch long. To replace the flint, remove the metal surrounding the flame and the spark wheel. You'll have to twist it out of position. Once you have removed the metal you'll see that there is a spring. The spring should be about an inch to an inch and a half long. The flint is the small piece of equipment that is about a quarter inch. It will be black and cylindrical. The flint is used to make the spark. Remove the flint from this spring. Now put in a new piece of flint. Reassembling the lighter is easy - put the flint in, stick the spring back in the hole, and then place the top back on.


You can buy a new flint for 75 cents online.

, To replace the flint, flick open the lighter, and pull up on the chimney. The chimney is the thing with five holes of each side of it. You'll want to pull until its all the way out. Under the chimney there should be a piece of what looks like cotton that is held in place by a screw. Carefully unscrew the screw and pull it out along with the spring and small piece of metal inside. Drop the new flint in, replace the spring, tighten the screw, and replace the box back in the lighter casing. You should be good to go. , This means you have a problem with your fuel release. You can do this with tweezers, needle-nose pliers, or anything else that works. Turn the nozzle from which the gas escapes counter-clockwise a few times. It might just be too tight. If that doesn't work you might might need to get yourself a new one. Luckily they aren't that expensive. "

Find the sparkwheel.,
Know the function of the ignition button.,
Envision how the lighter works.",How to Flick a Bic Lighter2," This serrated metal wheel, also called the striker, is the part of the lighter that creates a spark. When you roll the wheel down into the lighter chamber, it strikes against a piece of flint. The resultant spark ignites the gas from the fuel well, creating a small, steady flame.

, The red ignition button, when pressed, releases the gas valve to the fuel tank. In order to light the lighter, you'll need to strike the sparkwheel and hold the ignition button at the exact same time.

, When you spin the wheel, you make a spark. When you hold the button, you release a steady stream of gas. When you do to the two at the same time, the spark ignites the gas and sends a small flame through the hole at the top of the lighter. The flame will keep burning for as long as you hold the button.

"
"
Keep trying.,
Consider removing the safety band.,
Check the fuel level.,
Have a look at the striker or ""sparkwheel.""",How to Flick a Bic Lighter3," If you are using a relatively new Bic lighter, the problem likely lies with your technique rather than with some malfunction within the tool. Work on your hand placement. Make sure that you are striking the spark wheel quickly and powerfully enough to generate a spark. Check that you are holding down the ignition button and not just letting it go.


Bic lighters should still work in somewhat rainy and windy conditions. If you are having trouble flicking the Bic, however, try cupping the lighter with your hand or otherwise blocking the wind so that it cannot steal away the flame. Create a dry space with still air.

, This will make the lighter somewhat less ""safe,"" but it will make it easier to light. You won't need to apply so much force to create a spark. Many Bic owners make a practice of removing the safety band as soon as they buy a new lighter.

, If the lighter doesn't light, check to make sure that there is fuel in the tank. It will be obvious with a transparent lighter. Hold an opaque lighter up to a light source. With a darker colored lighter, hold the top some distance away from your ear and tap it a few times. Keep your thumb on the lever and away from the striker wheel so you don't set your head on fire. You should hear a fairly strong hiss.


If the lighter is out of fuel, throw it away. Disposable lighters are not meant to be refilled.
You should be able to get up to 3,000 lights from a full-sized Bic lighter.

, If the lighter has fuel but still doesn't light, then the problem may be with the striker. Cheap lighters and Bics that have been used extensively will fail after a while because, while it still produces a visible spark, it's not dense enough to light the butane.


If the Bic is still producing a spark, you can hold the striker wheel down hard and very slowly turn it, grinding a little bit of flint off the stick. When the striker is hit full force, it should scatter and ignite the flint, which should be enough to light the butane. Be careful: the bits of flint can scatter and land on skin or clothing. The likelihood of burning yourself is very small, but still existent.
If the striker produces no spark at all but there is still butane in the tank: put the tips of two lighters together. Hold down the ignition button of the first lighter to release fuel. Then, use the striker from the other, functioning lighter (possibly one that has run out of fuel) to light the first.

Gather your materials.,
Pull the lighter out of the metal case.,
Lift the lever that reads, “Lift to Fill.” Zippo lighters make it easy for you to figure out how to refill them.,
Squirt Zippo Premium fluid into the lighter.,
Reinsert the lighter into the case.",How to Put Lighter Fluid in a Lighter2," Zippo lighters are generally made to be reusable. In order to refill a zippo lighter, you'll need zippo lighter fluid, a small flathead or pin, and a zippo lighter. You can buy lighter fluid online, or at the store where you purchased your zippo lighter., Open the case of your zippo lighter. Grab the edge of the lighter and pull it out of its case. It might be a little hard to get out if it’s a newer lighter.







, There is a small lever on the bottom of a zippo lighter that reads ""lift to refill."" Use your fingers to lift this lever. If you can't get it opened using your fingers, this is where you would use a pushpin or flathead to lift the lever.







, Now, take your bottle of lighter fluid. Insert the nozzle of the bottle into the compartment just under the lever. Squirt some fluid into the lighter. Do this just until the padding on the inside of the lighter is damp. Once you're done, close the lever.







, Once you're done, reinsert your lighter into the case. It should not be ready for use. Under no circumstances should you light your zippo lighter when its out of its case. Lighter fluid may have dripped during the process. You could end up burning your hand or causing the lighter to explode.

Gather your materials.,
Use a screwdriver to remove the screw holding the lighter together.,
Run a flat blade screwdriver along the seam of the case.,
Remove the fluid reservoir.,
Disassemble a new lighter.,
Disassemble the fluid reservoir.,
Replace the fork, spring, and jet from the new lighter with those from the fluid reservoir.,
Insert the new lighter into the body of the extended-reach lighter.,
Close the case up with the screw.",How to Put Lighter Fluid in a Lighter3," An extended-reach lighter, also called a wander lighter, is used to light hard-to-reach places, like the pilot light in your oven. The fluid resevoir inside an extended-reach lighter is very similar to a normal BIC lighter. You can modify a regular bic lighter slightly and use it as a replacement reservoir for an extended wand lighter. This may be cheaper than purchasing a new lighter each time your extended-wand lighter runs out of fluid. To start, gather your materials. You will need the following:


A new bic lighter
A Philips head and flat blade screwdriver

, A single screw holds an extended-reach wand lighter together. Remove this screw. This will allow you to open the lighter. If the screw does not come out immediately after you unscrew it, gently tap the lighter against a flat surface so it falls out. Make sure to keep the screw in a safe place, as you'll need to reinsert it later.







, This will break the seal holding the case together. Once you've broken the seal, you can open the extended-reach lighter slightly, allowing you to remove the canister.







, Reach into the extended wand lighter. Remove a small device that looks like a regular bic lighter. This is the fluid reservoir.







, You will need to modify your bic lighter first before inserting it into the extended wand lighter. You can disassemble the lighter with your fingers.Remove the windscreen. This is the metal casing circling the top of the lighter.
Remove the flint wheel. This is the bumpy, circular part you press your thumb against when lighting the lighter. You should also remove the spring tip and flint, which are attached to the wheel. Once you pull the wheel out of the lighter, these parts should come out as well.
Remove the fork, which is the plastic part, often colored red, lining the tip of the lighter. You press down on the tip of the fork when lighting a lighter. You should also remove the spring and jet off the lighter. These are two long devices, one metallic and the other a spring, sticking into two holes in the canister of the lighter. You should be able to see the spring and jet easily once you remove the fork.

, Just as you disassembled the new lighter, you can disassemble the fluid reservoir. The fluid reservoir should have a fork spring as well, although it may be lightly colored, with a spring and jet underneath. You’ll see that they are very similar, but that the jet from the extended-reach lighter is slightly longer.








, Now, you can modify the new lighter. Place the fork and spring into the two holes on top of the old lighter. Then, snap the fork on top of the new lighter.







, Make sure that the button is in line with the trigger of the case. In other words, make sure you can draw an imaginary line running from the extended wand lighter's trigger to the button, found on the edge of the fork, of the new lighter. Check that the lighter works, and then you can reseal the lighter.








, Reinsert the screw you removed in the beginning back into the outside case of the lighter. You may want to run a line of acrylic or superglue along the edges of the lighter to reseal it further.

Use authentic Zippo Lighter Fluid.,
Remove the insert from the case.,
Lift the felt pad.,
Squirt in lighter fluid to refuel the lighter.,
Push the top felt pad back down.,
Insert your lighter back into the casing.,
Test your lighter.",How to Refill a Lighter4," Other brands of lighter fluid intended for similar lighters will work most of the time, but the Zippo fluid is recommended by the manufacturer for maintaining its condition and operation.If you use a different brand of lighter fluid, make sure it is a premium brand. Sub-par fuel may fail to ignite in your lighter.
Never use charcoal lighter fluid. Charcoal lighter fluid is not made for a small container like a Zippo. Using charcoal fluid can be very dangerous.

, The insert, which includes the chimney-shaped wind guard, should be wedged inside a rectangular metal case.Use your fingers to pull the insert free of the case.








Grab the chimney cap, the small rectangular portion with holes in it, and pull the lighter out. In some cases, you may need to loosen the insert by wiggling it back and forth.
The refill access for Zippo lighter's (and most similarly designed lighters, too) is at the bottom of the insert.

, Flip the insert over so the bottom faces up. You'll see a small circular pin. Surrounding this pin and sealing off the bottom will be a rectangular piece of felt, known as the felt pad. Lift the felt pad at the designated location with a screwdriver.








The rectangular felt pad will say “LIFT TO FILL” on it. Lift the felt pad from this end to reveal the rayon balls, which look like cotton, and a wick underneath.
There may also be a small hole in the center of the felt pad. Use a small screwdriver or pen and insert it into the hole. Use your tool as a lever to pull the felt pad up., While holding the felt pad back, put the tip of your lighter fluid into the lighter insert and squeeze gently. Keep squirting lighter fluid until you see the top portion of your rayon balls dampen.








Be careful not to let lighter fluid drip down the outside of your Zippo or get any on your hands.
Wipe up spills with a wet rag. Rinse the rag regularly while doing so to flush fuel down the drain.
Refill slowly so you don’t overfill the lighter. If you add too much fluid, your lighter will leak, which can be dangerous.

, Release your hold on the felt pad and wedge it back into place with your fingers or tool. Let the fluid soak in for about 45 seconds before flipping it right side up. Wipe the outside of your lighter with a damp clean rag or paper towel.








It’s also a good idea to wash your hands before placing your lighter back into the casing. Some fluid might've transferred to your hands without you noticing.

, Simply slide your Zippo back into the casing. Push down on the chimney to firmly wedge it back into place. Snap the lid shut to make sure the insert is low enough.








, Light your Zippo to make sure that the wick is absorbing the fuel and your flint is creating a spark. If your lighter doesn't spark up, the most likely issue is the flint. Check out fixing and replacing this part in the next method.









The first couple of times you light your Zippo after refilling, your flame may be bigger than usual. This is completely normal.

Unstick stiff flint wheels.,
Unfasten the flint screw at the bottom of the insert to replace the flint.,
Remove the flint.,
Replace the flint and reassemble the flint mechanism.,
Test the new flint.",How to Refill a Lighter5," You shouldn't have to replace the flint of stuck flint wheels. Normal flints mechanisms have three parts: a spring, a flint, and the flint wheel. When new, these parts can stick, preventing sparks needed to ignite the flame. To resolve this issue:

Open the lighter. Remove the insert from the lighter case by pulling on the insert by the flame guard, which is the raised part of the insert with holes in it.
Remove the flat head slotted screw fastening the flint spring at the bottom of the insert by turning it counterclockwise with a screwdriver.
Pull out the screw and attached flint spring. Tap the top of the lighter to knock the flint loose. Replace the flint, spring, and refasten the screw. Your flint wheel should be unstuck., Pull the lighter insert from its case. Turn the insert upside down. You should see the brass screw fastening the flint spring. Unfasten this with a screwdriver or the case of the lighter., While keeping the bottom of the insert oriented upward, pull out the unfastened screw and attached flint spring. Tap the insert gently into your palm to knock loose the flint so it falls into your hand.

The flint will look like a very small cylinder roughly the size of the flint spring tip. Old flints can be thrown away., While holding the insert so its bottom is still facing upwards, drop the new flint down into the flint hole. Reinsert the spring into the hole and refasten the screw., Replace the insert back into the case. Make sure the case is seated correctly by closing the case. When the insert is correctly positioned, light the lighter as you would normally.

If, after replacing the flint, your lighter still doesn't work, it might be out of fuel. Check and refill fuel as necessary.

Chew gum.,
Wash your hands well with soap.,
Clean your face.,
Air out your hair.,
Use dryer sheets or Febreeze on your clothes.",How to Cover the Smell of a Cigarette1," Keep gum handy to pop a piece in your mouth after you've smoked a cigarette to give yourself minty breath. Along with other methods, chewing gum is the easiest and best way to mask the smell of cigarettes. You might even consider chewing some gum while you smoke and then popping in another piece when you're finished.






If you get a chance, brush your teeth before anyone gets the chance to smell you. The smell of breath spray usually wears out quickly, but it's another effective method, as well as mouthwash.;
, The hand in which you hold your cigarette will have the most lingering smell. Washing them thoroughly is the most practical way of getting the smoke off your hands. Use a strongly-scented liquid soap to get the most effective cleaning.





, Washing your face with soap and water is also important. Scrub your face quickly as you wash your hands, particularly around your chin and mouth. If you have facial hair, pay particular attention to getting deep in your beard and scrubbing.






An alcohol swab or a big spray of deodorant will do the job, effectively but might also be a conspicuous masking smell. If you're trying to keep people unsuspecting, coming in reeking of cologne might do more harm than good. Instead, just dab a bit of deodorant near your neck. This way people will just think you put on a little bit too much of it, and not that you're trying to cover something.

, If you have long hair, put it back in a ponytail before smoking and let it down when you're finished. Walk around a bit before you have to be around people, or drive with the windows down to get the smell out naturally.






If you have a combing cream, you might consider using it, or other hair products that you normally use.

, To make your clothes smell like clothes, use fabric sheets, which are made to absorb smells like smoke. Febreeze has a light natural smell that serves a similar function, working to remove the smell rather than simply mask it like a cologne, aftershave, or perfume.






Never keep half-smoked cigarettes or cigarette butts in your pocket. These smell much more strongly than smoke and the ashtray smell they bring will be much harder to get out. Don't litter them, but find a proper receptacle for your butts.Keep a smoking kit in your car or desk that includes some kind of gum and dryer sheets. Making use of these two items and washing up is an effective combination. Cut down on your stress by keeping your anti-stink kit with you whenever you might smoke.

Avoid disreputable cigarette vendors.",How to Buy Cigarettes Online Quickly," Today, a wide variety of sites selling cigarettes exist online. Using a simply query like ""cigarettes online"" in your preferred search engine should yield dozens of relevant results. Each site may have its own selection of brands, products, and accessories for you to browse, so you may want to look at a few sites before making your decision.;
, When you've found an online cigarette vendor that you like, browse through the cigarettes available to find your preferred brand(s). Most cigarette sites will carry most popular, well-known brands like Marlboro, Camel, etc., while some will have foreign or exotic varieties for sale.


Generally, cigarette sites will have a prominent list of the brands offered in their ""Cigarettes"" section. Many cigarette sites will also have a search bar (usually located in one of the page's upper corners) that allows you to search for your desired products.

, When you've found some cigarettes you like, look for an ""Add to cart"" button on the page. This will usually be prominently located near the picture or title of the product you're interested in buying. Clicking this button adds the product to your online ""cart"", which is a running tally of the products you intend to purchase. Nearly all online retail sites, from enormous ones like Amazon.com to the smallest independent retailers, use this ""Add to cart"" system.


Adding items to your cart doesn't purchase them right away, so there's no need to worry if you accidentally add the wrong cigarettes to your cart.

, When you've added all of the cigarettes you'd like to buy to your cart, look for a button somewhere on the page that says ""Proceed to checkout"". This will take you to a series of screens where you'll confirm and finalize your purchase. You'll also have the option to eliminate items from your order, if you'd like.


Note that some sites may require you to sign up with an account before you can check out and purchase your cigarettes.

, During the checkout process, you'll be asked for certain pieces of personal information so that the cigarettes can be paid for and shipped to you. You'll want to have a valid credit handy and to be sure of your billing and shipping addresses so that you'll be able to supply this information easily. Fill out the information in the appropriate text boxes, then proceed to the next page.


Be wary of scam sites that may try to rob you of important personal data. While most online retailers will require your credit card information and address to buy cigarettes, you should never have to supply your social security number or bank account information. If you are asked for this, leave the site immediately.

, If you want to get your cigarettes as quickly as possible, you may want to opt for a special shipping option. If this is available, it will usually be offered to you during the checkout process. Some sites may offer options as quick as next-day shipping, though these can become quite pricey, so weigh your desire to get your cigarettes quickly against the cash you have to spend before making a decision.

, At the end of the checkout process, you'll be given a breakdown of your entire order — everything you're about to buy, the shipping options you've chosen, the address your order will be shipped to, and so on. At this point, you'll want to ensure that everything in your order is correct, because it can be tricky to cancel an order and receive a refund with online shopping.


When you've finished reviewing your order, confirm it to make the purchase. There will usually be a prominent button near the bottom your order labeled ""Confirm"" or ""Finalize"".

, Congratulations! You've just purchased cigarettes online. After making your purchase, all you'll need to do is sit back and wait. Your cigarettes should arrive within the time frame specified by the vendor. If they don't, you may need to contact the vendor to receive an update on the status of your order or request a refund. Contact information should be available on the site you purchased your cigarettes from.

, As a general rule, it is a crime both to sell tobacco to a minor and to purchase tobacco if you are a minor. In the United States, all 50 states have laws that make it legal to sell tobacco to people under the age of 18.Many other countries have similar laws in place. Though penalties for buying and consuming tobacco as a minor are mild compared to those for more serious types of crime, it's still a very bad idea to buy cigarettes as a minor, as receiving a mark on your criminal record at a young age can cause problems down the line — for example, when applying for college.


Typically, in the U.S., the immediate penalty for a minor who buys cigarettes is a fine or community service.For the business that sells the cigarettes, the penalties can be more severe.
Most online vendors use a credit or debit card to pay for your order. In the U.S., you must be 18 to be able to have your own credit card, which is also the same age you must be to legally purchase cigarettes.

, When you buy cigarettes online, you'll typically have to pay a shipping and handling fee which you wouldn't normally have had to pay if you had bought your cigarettes from the store. Sometimes, this can offset the savings you would have gotten by buying from a duty-free online site. However, in the case of some retailers, you may be able to get a good deal by buying in bulk if the shipping and handling fee is charged on a per-order or per-box basis. While buying many cartons of cigarettes can get quite expensive, this practice can save you money in the long run.


Note, however, that some retailers charge a flat shipping rate based on the number of cartons you buy. This means that, on these sites, buying in bulk doesn't get you a better deal.

, Not all cigarette retailers are created equal. Just like brick-and-mortar stores, some offer affordable deals and great incentives, while others will try rip you off. Before making a decision, try to find your preferred product on multiple websites. Compare both the product's price and the site's shipping and handling rates — sometimes, stores will offer a great price, but make up for it with steep fees.

, One thing you'll probably notice as soon as you begin to look at online cigarette retailers is that, often, dozens of different brands of cigarettes are sold on the site. Some of these brands are well-known — Marlboro, Kool, Lucky Strike, and so on — while others are somewhat obscure. While it can be tempting to go for a cheap brand you've never heard of, this can be a bad idea. If you don't like the taste or feel of the brand, you may be stuck with a carton or more of sub-par cigarettes.


Most online cigarette retailers sell cigarettes in cartons. This is an awful lot of cigarettes to have if you don't end up liking the product, so, if you're looking to try something new, it may be a better idea to go to a specialty smoke shop in person and ask the staff for a recommendation. This way, you may be able to buy just a pack of the new brand, minimizing the damage if you end up disliking the cigarettes.

, Thought many of the most popular online cigarette retailers are perfectly reputable and reliable, it's important to know that some are not. Some scam cigarette sites (for instance, Cigarettepurchase.com), which are often foreign-operated, sell cheap counterfeit cigarettes at name-brand prices. These poorly-produced cigarettes are not held to high sanitation standards and the sale of these cigarettes can help fund organized crime.Other scam sites may not send your order at all or may even attempt to steal your personal financial data. Protect yourself when shopping for cigarettes online by avoiding sites that have the following warning signs:


Sloppy or extremely basic site design
Obvious spelling/grammar errors
Checkout pages that ask you for unnecessary personal information (SS number, bank acct. info, check routing numbers, etc.)
No ""Feedback"" or ""Contact Us"" information
Payment pages that require you to send money via Western Union or wire transfer service

Care for your e-cigarette.",How to Enjoy Vaping (E Cigarettes)," There are many types of e-cigarettes, and beginners do not have to spend a lot to get a quality product. Different types will provide for different smoking experiences, but all have a range of options for different budgets and experience levels.Minis, or so-called “cig-a-likes” look like cigarettes, and use pre-filled cartridges. They come in rechargeable and disposable varieties, and have limited flavor options and battery life.
Advanced Personal Vaporizers (AVPs), or “Vape Pens” allow you to control the power level, and subsequently can produce more vapor. AVPs can also hold more liquid, and have a longer charge.
MODs are a higher vapor, lower nicotine system that are designed for the user to customize. They are usually used by experienced vapers, as the user should know how to define factors such as amount of vapor and battery strength.
Many users start out with disposable e-cigarettes to make sure they enjoy vaping before moving onto larger setups.;
, E-liquid, or e-juice, is what goes into the e-cigarette to create the vapor. Currently, there are two common carrier liquids: propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin(VG).Propylene glycol is a thin, odorless, colorless liquid that is effective at carrying flavors. It is the most common fluid used to suspend flavors and nicotine. Some users claim PG provides a sensation most similar to smoking tobacco.
Vegetable glycerin is a derivative of vegetable oil, and is vegetarian friendly. It is a thicker liquid that has some natural sweetness, and produces a much smoother vapor. Due to its thickness, vaping high VG liquids can clog coils faster and reduce the life of some atomizers.
VG and PG can be used on their own or mixed. Experimenting with ratios and finding the right mix for you will provide the most rewarding experience. Try buying different mixes from your local vape store to see what you like best.
Flavor and nicotine strength can also be changed using e-liquid. Try a higher PG percentage for a stronger flavor, and higher VG percentage for more vapor.

, Vaping allows you greater control over how much nicotine you get, and your choice in e-liquid and smoking device will help determine how much nicotine you want. E-liquid nicotine is measured in mg/ml, and different amounts provide different experiences. Keep in mind, though, that increased nicotine levels may present an increased health risk.0mg/ml means there is no nicotine in the liquid. It can be used to get a fuller flavor, and to satisfy residual habits of those who have quit smoking.
3mg/ml to 6mg/ml is a light level generally used by light to moderate smokers, or people who want some nicotine but more flavor from their liquid. 3 mg/ml is generally preferred for systems with re-buildable atomizers.
12mg/ml to 18mg/ml is a level generally comfortable for heavy smokers. It provides more nicotine, and is preferred by those using a cartomizer.
Levels above 18mg/ml are available, but it is advisable to stay away from those unless lower levels cannot satisfy a nicotine addiction with lower levels. It is always easier to start lower and increase than to start with too strong a liquid., The throat hit (also called lung hit) is the feeling of satisfaction you get from the nicotine against the back of your throat and in your lungs. Changing how you smoke your e-cigarette can greatly improve that sensation, especially for tobacco smokers.Take longer, slower drags than you would with a cigarette. Allow the vapor to build up for 3 to 5 seconds.
Once you have a good drag, hold the vapor in longer before you exhale. This allows more of the product to get to the back of the throat and down into the lungs.
Pick a flavor that replicates tobacco. If you are looking to replicate the experience of smoking a cigarette, sweet or fruity flavors may diminish the experience. Try a tobacco flavored e-liquid instead.

, If you are not a former smoker, or if the throat hit does not appeal to you, try not inhaling the smoke. Nicotine can pass through the tissue in your mouth and nose, meaning you do not have to inhale to get effect of the nicotine.


Hold the vapor in your mouth for a few seconds before exhaling to allow the nicotine to pass through the tissue.
Enhance the experience by exhaling through the nose, where the nicotine vapor may also be absorbed.

, Standard atomizers generally have a coils between 1.0 and 3.0 ohms. Sub-ohm atomizers are those under 1.0 ohm. Sub-ohm vaping allows for larger vapor clouds, if vapor production is your main goal.Sub-ohm vaping does present some dangers because of the wattage needed to power the device. It is important to use only sub-ohm compatible clearomizers with sub-ohm atomizers, and make sure the device has a high enough wattage to handle sub-ohm vaping. Exact wattage depends upon the ohms of the atomizer.
Sub-ohm vaping is not recommended for new vapers.

, Stepping, or stepping down, is the process of gradually decreasing nicotine amounts to help smokers quit. Stepping allows for a gradual transition from an addictive amount of nicotine to little or no nicotine.Starting and ending nicotine levels will be very personal. Start with a nicotine level that keeps you satisfied, and gradually decrease from there.
Many start from the 12mg/ml - 18mg/ml range, and gradually decrease to 3mg/ml before reaching the 0mg/ml or quitting steps.
There is no set protocol for how long you should take at each nicotine level. Many experienced vapers recommend waiting until you adjust to a given nicotine level and stop craving a higher level before you take a step down.
Stepping is often cited by former smokers as a method that helped them break their habit, but there is currently a limited amount of scientific research investigating vaping as a long-term means of effectively quitting smoking.

, Keeping your e-cigarette clean is crucial to making sure you have an enjoyable vaping experience. It also helps you get more life from your e-cigarette. If your e-liquid tastes stale or burnt, it is time to clean your e-cigarette. Never submerge your e-cigarette, or get water around the battery while cleaning. Make sure no electrical components are live before you start to clean.
Use a cotton swab or paper towel dampened in lukewarm water to wipe around the battery terminal end of the atomizer and drip tip. Blow out any old e-liquid from the tip.
Use a dry paper towel or cotton swab to clean inside of the battery terminal.
Reassemble your e-cigarette, and allow the wick to soak in e-liquid for several seconds before you restart it.

, When you clean your e-cigarette, remember to charge the battery, as well. A fully charged battery ensures that you get the maximum life from your e-cigarette.


Charge the battery simply by using the charger provided with purchase of your e-cigarette. Try to only charge completely dead batteries, as this helps extend their lifespan.
Allow the battery to charge fully before you reassemble your e-cigarette. This gives the most life possible in between disassembling.

, You should not need to replace too many parts of your e-cigarette too often, but any electrical device will experience some wear. Replace parts as necessary to keep your e-cigarette functioning efficiently.Most batteries will last no more than 300 charges.
Cartridges should be used no more than 10 times prior to replacement.
If liquid drops out the bottom or bubbles up in your mouth, the atomizer coil may have burned out. Check to see if it needs replacement by taking it into a vape shop for a professional opinion.

, Wear is inevitable, but damaging your e-cigarette will make it happen much faster. Do not throw it around or store it in an area where it might get damaged, such as the bottom of a purse or backpack.


Invest in stands and holders for your e-cigarette so that it has a safe place no matter where you take it. This will provide a longer life for your e-cigarette, and a more enjoyable vaping experience.

Begin in a clean area.,
Disassemble your electronic cigarette.,
Wipe down the parts.,
Clean the battery terminal.,
Charge your battery.,
Make sure your mouthpiece is clear.,
Clean it every time you change the e-liquid.,
Consider cleaning it when the smoke starts to taste bad.,
Check for residue.,
Put your electronic cigarette in its proper place.,
Charge your battery at the right time.,
Use the right e-liquid.",How to Clean an Electronic Cigarette," You won’t clean your electronic cigarette properly if you start in a dirty area. Make sure to start in a clean, sanitary area. Lay a clean towel on the table where you will be disassembling the electronic cigarette. Gather some fresh paper towels to use on the electronic cigarette.You may also need some cotton swabs for hard-to-reach areas.;
, Take off the atomizer from your electronic cigarette. If there is a drip tip, then simply remove it. Take away the atomizer cone or drip guard as well, if it is there.If you’re unsure that you’re removing the right parts, you can google an image of the structure of an e-cigarette. Or, you can find a YouTube video of someone disassembling one.

, Specifically, wipe down the drip tip, atomizer cone and atomizer. Push the paper towel in the direction of the battery end of your atomizer and your drip tip. Blow very lightly through the drip tip to force outdated e-liquid into the paper towel. If the electronic cigarette has a drip protector and an atomizer cone, fold the paper towel into a snug triangle and pressure it right through to absorb any stray e-liquid.Fold your paper towel into a square so that it can soak up a lot more.

, Refold the paper towel to uncover a dry section. It is advisable to push it inside of your electronic cigarette to clean inside the battery terminal. Use a cotton swab if the paper towel doesn’t work for you. Repeat this process a couple of times., Take your battery and keep it on the charger. When it is totally charged, you can use it again. Then, reassemble the electronic cigarette, and you are finished cleaning it., Even if you clean your electronic cigarette regularly, things like dust and fluff can quickly build up in the mouthpiece. This is unsanitary and blocks the flow of vapor. To clear it, just remove it and blow through the mouthpiece. You can also use a twisted up paper towel to clear away any build up and then rinse it in warm water., It is recommended to clean the electronic cigarette every time you change the cartridge for the e-liquid. This assures that gunk doesn’t build up and improves the life of the device. Depending on how often you smoke, you may have to clean the electronic cigarette every day., You may start to get a bad aftertaste. This could mean a couple of things. This could be because the cartridge is dry, but often, it is because of a gunk build up. Even if you think it is a dry cartridge, it is better to be safe and clean your electronic cigarette., This may not be necessary if you clean your electronic cigarette on a daily basis. But, if it takes you a while to go through your e-liquid, it is good to check for residue. E-liquid can seep out and cause build up in the atomizer and chimney of your device. Residue can also be caused by build up in the coil. Disassemble and clean the cigarette any time you start to see build up., You should not throw your electronic cigarette somewhere in your car or down in your purse. It should be stored upright in a sanitary place. Then, store the case away from sunlight, water and high temperatures. Ideally, you should have a case for the device. If you don’t have a case, you can ask the seller of your electronic cigarette if there is a case available for your brand.

, You should not wait until your electronic cigarette is completely dead before charging it. Doing this will reduce the life of your device. Instead, charge it when there is still some battery left—around 15 to 20 percent at least.You should also not store your battery when it has a low charge. Always store it when it has 50 percent or more battery.

, Acidic e-liquids are the worst for your electronic cigarette because they can eat away at the tank. E-liquids that are high in nicotine can also be dangerous for your device because the liquid tends to get volatile as it ages. If you’re unsure what type of e-liquid to use for your electronic cigarette, ask for the advice of an employee at a place that sells electronic cigarettes.Even if you think you’re using the right juice, check the type of e-liquid you’re using if you begin to experience problems with your device.

Keep the window cracked.,
Use a homemade smoke scrubber.,
Burn incense and candles.,
Vacuum.,
Spray Febreeze on curtains, carpet, and other fabric.",How to Cover the Smell of a Cigarette2," If you're going to smoke indoors and want to ease up on the aftermath, smoke near open windows. Blowing the smoke out the window and keeping your burning cigarettes as close as possible to the window is the best way to cut down on the lingering smell of the smoke.


To ensure that the smoke doesn't drift back through the open window, consider using a small desk fan aimed toward the window. Keep the smoke going outward and you won't have to worry much about masking the smell later.

, Sometimes called a rasta tube, all you need to create nice-smelling smoke on your exhales is a toilet paper tube, some dryer sheets, and a rubber band. Stuff as many dryer sheets as you can into the TP tube and fix one sheet over the end, holding it in place using the rubber band. When you smoke, blow the smoke through the other end of the tube. It'll smell much less strongly.


Doing this won't completely eliminate the smell of the smoke, but it will make it smell much less strong. The smoke coming off the cigarette as it burns is still a major issue, though, so combine this with other methods, like smoking out the window and using masking scents.

, Keeping a good supply of scented candles and strong incense to burn while you smoke is a good idea in masking the smell of the cigarettes. Incense is a particularly good option, especially if you already burn it regularly, because it smells like smoke already. Suspicious parents or roommates might not recognize the undertone of cigarette funk underneath the Nag Champa., If you're in a carpeted room, there's that much more opportunity for smoke to become embedded in the room. If you want to get rid of the smoke smell, consider getting out the vacuum and giving the carpet a once-over. Vacuuming won't be enough by itself, but just agitating the carpet some can help air it out a little bit.

, Febreeze is a smoker's best friend. Its odor-eliminating properties and clean scent do wonders for masking the smell of cigarettes indoors. Keep a bottle handy and regularly treat fabric surfaces (as well as clothes) that you won't to remove the clinging smell of smoke from."
"
Always smoke outside.,
Remove outerwear before smoking.,
Wear a hat and gloves.,
Smoke standing up so the smell doesn't get into your pants or shoes.",How to Cover the Smell of a Cigarette3," If you're worried about being caught, smoking indoors has a tendency to make the smoke cling to you even worse, making it difficult to get the smoke smell off. Go outside where the air circulation is better and where the breeze can naturally carry the smoke away from you.


If it's windy, turn your back against the wind. This way the smoke will blow away from you, not back into your face, clothes and hair.
Some smokers think that smoking in humid or rainy weather makes the smoke less clingy. If you can find cover to keep your cigarette dry, smoke while it's raining to see if it works.

, If you can, take any jacket or coat you're wearing off before smoking and keep in a separate room, or keep clear of the smell of the smoke. You'll be able to keep your first layer smelling smoke free. You'll still carry the smell with you, but there's considerably less of your clothing that will smell like smoke.






Alternatively, wear a smoking jacket. Choose a thick wool or leather jacket that you only use for smoking.

, When you smoke, you can have a whole outfit set aside just for smoking, so that you can change into and out of it and avoid getting caught. Cover all of your hair with a stocking cap and wear thin gloves.


Take them off before you go inside and find someplace to stash them. Leaving them outside, maybe in a shed or your car, will let them air out far away from prying noses.

, It might sound stupid, but keeping the cigarette as far away from your body as possible will cut down considerably on the smell. Most of the stink doesn't come from the smoke you inhale and exhale, but from the smoke from the burning cigarette. Keep it away from you by setting it in an ashtray or on a log when you're not smoking to cut down on the cling.

Decide on what style of vapor cigarette you want to purchase.,
Choose a vapor cigarette starter kit.,
Ask the cigarette retailer about vapor performance.,
Ask the store if the vapor cigarette has a warranty.,
Look into the quality of existing vapor brands.,
Look for serial numbers when purchasing one.",How to Choose a Vapor Cig1," There are a variety of e-cigarette or vapor styles, ranging from mini models that look like traditional cigarettes to larger APV models used by more experienced smokers.Mini or Cig-A-Like models look like tobacco cigarettes and are very popular. They are small and lightweight. If you are just starting your vapor habit, these models are a good choice.Mid-size models are the size of a cigar and last longer than the mini models. They produce more vapor than the mini models.Advanced personal vaporizers (i.e., MODs) are designed with the advanced e-cigarette smoker in mind since they produce much more vapor than both mid-size and mini models. They are about the size of a flashlight.;
, Kits include all of the materials, vaporizers, batteries, and instructions for use. They are available for both complete beginners and more experienced smokers.Decide on whether you want a kit with pre-filled or refillable cartomizers. The pre-filled and disposable cartomizers are thrown out when they run out of the nicotine solution. In contrast, the refillable cartomizers need to be regularly refilled with nicotine solution.Decide how much you want to spend on a starter kit. Starter kits are typically between 30$ and 100$, Performance is commonly understood as including vapor production, throat hit, and battery life. To find the vapor cigarette that's right for you, consider all three factors.Vapor production is simply the amount of vapor produced by the e-cigarette. If you are a light smoker, you should be happy with low vapor production. If you are a heavy smoker, you will want an e-cigarette with higher vapor production.Vapor cigarettes try to mimic the burning sensation one gets from smoking a tobacco cigarette. The term throat hit is a way of describing this quality in a vapor cigarette, which can be weak or strong depending on the model.If you are a heavy smoker or on the road a lot, you may want to consider how long the battery will last on your vapor cigarette., Some vapor cigarettes and starter kits will come with a warranty, which can be helpful if any of the equipment is not in working order. It is also really important to shop at a reputable retailer so that you can get accurate product and warranty information.

, The vapor cigarette industry is competitive and rapidly growing, so it is wise to do some research on the existing brands and products.Look into the reputation of the vapor brands you are considering and the quality of their products.


Look at vapor cigarette review websites. There are a variety of websites that post reviews of new e-cigarette brands. You should familiarize yourself with the reviews of popular and new brands.Compare different brands by first trying their disposable vapor cigarettes. The small, disposable vapor cigarettes are cheaper than the starter kits. You can compare the quality of different brands by testing their disposable vapor cigarettes., Original vapor cigarettes have serial numbers located at the atomizer and battery’s connector parts while fake ones don’t have serial numbers. With a magnifying glass, locate these serial numbers.

Brush your teeth.,
Wash your hands after you smoke.,
Wash your clothes.,
Tie your hair back.,
Smoke near moving air.,
Carry cologne or perfume.",How to Cover up the Smell of Cigarette Smoke1," To help get rid of the smell of smoke on your breathe, brush your teeth often. Keep a travel toothbrush and toothpaste on you when you're out so you can brush your teeth before you spend time around others that might have a problem with the smell of smoke.


You can buy travel toothbrushes at any drugstore or general store.
You can also chew gum or carry mouthwash. Anything that will spread clean, fresh scent through your mouth.;
, The smell of smoke will remain on your hands long after you smoke. The nicotine and tar from the smoke will cling to the surface of your hands, making them smell. Wash your hands with a strong, pleasant smelling soap to rid your hands of the smell.


You can also use a scented lotion after washing your hands to make your hands smell better. This may help absorb smoky smells the next time you have a cigarette. Just remember to reapply after you've smoked a few times to keep the smell down.
If you can't wash your hands, try a scented hand sanitizer to remove the smell of smoke from your hands., You may not think your clothes smell like smoke, but that is because you are used to the smell. Others will be able to smell it as soon as they see you. Wash your clothes after every use to ensure you get the smoke smell out. You should also avoid smoking around your clothes because they will get the smell in them before you wear them.


If the smells are stubborn, try adding a cup of vinegar to your wash to help remove the smell.Thick materials like wool are particularly absorbent to smell, so make sure these are washed well.
The sleeves of your shirts are more susceptible to smoky odors than other parts of your clothes. Roll up your sleeves while you smoke to help keep the smell of the smoke off your clothes while you are out.
If it is cold, wear a jacket when you smoke. You can take the jacket off when you are done and hang it up. This way, you leave the scent of smoke on the jacket. Make sure to wash your jackets if you do this.

, Cigarette smoke clings to your hair after you smoke. To help avoid this, pull your hair out of your face with a clip or hair tie. This will make your hair less exposed to the smoke. Make sure you wash your hair every night to remove any smell that got in it during the day.


Avoid using too many hair products. Gels and mousses will cause your hair to absorb scents.
Try citrus scented shampoos, which can help keep the smell away., If you smoke inside a room or building, the smoke can build up all over your body. When you smoke inside, try to smoke near an exhaust fan, under a ceiling fan, or near an open window. This will blow the smoke away from you instead of letting it stick around your body.


You can point a box fan out of the window of the room you are smoking to help suck the smoke out of the room.When you smoke outside, stand with your back to the breeze so that the smoke blows away from you.

, If you don't have time to wash your clothes before you see the people don't like the smell, try using cologne or perfume to cover it up. A spritz or two of cologne or perfume may not completely mask the smell of smoke, but it will help cover up the scent for a little while.


You can easily put on too much if you are eager to cover up the smell. Refrain from using more than one or two sprays at a time."

Watch where you ash.,
Hold your cigarette steadily between your index and middle finger.,
Flick downward once or multiple times to get rid of ash.",How to Ash Your Cigarette1," Before attempting this method, make sure you have an acceptable place to ash. An ashtray is preferable, but in the absence of one you should ash in the sink, in a cup, on asphalt, or a surface that can be easily cleaned. Avoid ashing on wood, carpet, tile, or cloth as these will be stained and/or burned.;
, The cigarette should be firmly held at a point where the middle finger acts as the fulcrum. Your middle finger will hold it in place, keeping it firm so it doesn’t move while being flicked. Your grip on the cigarette shouldn’t be too rough otherwise you might split it in half. , Press down firmly on the filter with the pad of your thumb with your index and middle finger holding the cigarette in place. The tip of the cigarette will shake so the ash falls below.

Sprinkle the shisha into the bowl.,
Cover the bowl.,
Finish assembling the hookah.,
Choose your charcoal.,
Light two or three coals.,
Place the coal on top of the bowl.,
Let the bowl warm up.,
Inhale gently and slowly.",How to Start a Hookah," Even if the hookah is brand new, clean it to remove any foreign flavors and chemicals. Scrub every piece of the hookah with a soft brush, except for the non-washable hoses.It's easiest to clean the hookah right after each smoking session, instead of leaving residue to dry. At minimum, clean after every fourth or fifth session.;
, There are many parts to a hookah, but it's not too tough to figure out. Here are the terms used in the instructions below:



Base — The lowest section of the hookah. This can be detached and filled with water.

Shaft — The main vertical body of the hookah. The lower end has a stem that sits in the water.

Gasket — Silicone or rubber ""donuts."" Anywhere two parts fit together, you need one of these to make the connection airtight. Also called a grommet.

Valves — Each smoking hose fits over a valve, located on the shaft.

Bowl — The container at the top that holds hookah tobacco, also called shisha.

, Check the ""stem,"" or thin lowest part of the shaft. Add enough water to submerge the stem about an inch (2.5 cm) under the water. Avoid overfilling the base, as the layer of air makes the smoke smooth and easier to pull.Add ice to keep the smoke cool and less harsh.
Some people enjoy mixing the water with other liquids for additional flavors, such as juice or vodka. Most drinks will work, but stay away from milk and dairy products, which can ruin the hookah., Attach the silicone or rubber gasket to the top of the base. Push the main shaft into the gasket to ensure an airtight seal. Confirm that the stem reaches 1 inch (2.5 cm) under the water. Use the smaller gaskets to fit the hoses over the valves on the shaft's side.


Some hookah models will leak air unless every valve is attached to a hose or a rubber stopper. Others are self-sealing.

, Cover the hole at the top of the hookah shaft with your palm. Try to inhale through one of the hoses. If you succeed in pulling in air, one of the connections is not airtight. Inspect each connection and correct this:


If you’re having trouble fitting a part inside a gasket, wet the gasket with water or a drop of dish soap.If a connection is a little loose, wrap the stem with electrical tape and fit the gasket over the tape.If you're missing a gasket, wrap athletic tape around the stem.Keep wrapping until you can connect the two parts with a tight fit.

, Choose any flavor of shisha, or tobacco packed in molasses and glycerin. Before removing any from the container, mix it together to bring the flavorful syrup back up from the bottom., Take a small pinch of the shisha and gently break it apart between your fingers, over a plate. If you see stems, cut them into small pieces or discard them.Repeat until you have enough to loosely fill the bowl.

, Leave it loose, not packed, so air can flow through it. Add tobacco until it forms an even layer about 1/12—1/8” (2–3 mm) below the rim of the bowl. If stacked too high, it will stick to the aluminum foil and scorch.If there are a few pieces sticking up too high, gently knock them down with a damp paper towel.
You may want to practice with tobacco-free hookah molasses until you've learned the process. This is less likely to burn., You can buy a reusable hookah bowl screen for this purpose, but a homemade foil cover may control heat more reliably.Wrap aluminum foil tightly over the bowl to form a taut surface. Using a paper clip or needle, punch holes in the foil to allow air flow. Try a circle of holes near the outer rim, then more holes spiraling inward.More holes means more heat on the tobacco, and therefore more smoke. Try starting with about 15 holes.If inhaling is difficult or you’d like more smoke, you can add more holes. Some people prefer 50–100 holes.Make the holes small to avoid letting in flakes of ash.

, Attach the ash-collecting tray to the top of the hookah shaft. Fit the bowl over the top hole, making an airtight connection.

, There are two broad categories of hookah charcoal available, each with different benefits:Quick light charcoal heats up fast, but burns cooler and faster. In the worst case, they can leave a chemical taste or cause a headache.
Natural charcoal doesn’t interfere with flavor, but takes about ten minutes on a stove to heat up. Coconut shell and lemon wood charcoal are two popular options.

, Coal size and bowl size vary, so you may need to experiment. Try two or three coals first and adjust from there.Light as follows, depending on the charcoal type:Quick light: Hold the coal with tongs, over a nonflammable area. Hold it in a lighter or match flame until it stops sparking and smoking. Remove flame and wait until the entire piece is fully covered with light grey ash, about 10–30 seconds. Blow on it if necessary until all of it glows orange.
Natural: Place the coal on the coil burner of a stove, or directly in the flame of a gas stove. Crank heat to maximum and leave for 8–12 minutes. It should be glowing orange, but the ash layer is optional. Do not place the coal where ash could fall in the gas line, or on a glass-top stove.

, Use your coal tongs to transfer the hot coals to the foil or screen on top of the hookah bowl. Arrange the coals evenly around the rim of the bowl, or even slightly overhanging the edge. Leave the center clear unless you’re certain you need more heat.Keep an eye out for sagging foil.You don’t want the coal to touch the tobacco and scorch it.

, Many people wait three to five minutes before the first pull. Many other start smoking right away. Give both methods a try, since they may change the flavor and smoothness of the smoke.


Some hookahs and types of charcoal take as long as 10–30 minutes to warm up properly, but these are the exception.

, Draw in the smoke by inhaling normally through the hose. There’s no need to strain or try to get as much smoke as possible. Even if your first pull is low on smoke, trust that more will build up as you continue. Pulling too hard or too often may overheat the shisha, since your breath is drawing hot air through the bowl.

Regularly replace the atomizer on your vapor cigarette.,
Consider battery life when shopping for a vapor cigarette.,
Decide whether you want a manual or an automatic battery design.",How to Choose a Vapor Cig2," The atomizer is the part of a vapor cigarette that heats up the e-liquid to produce the vapor that you inhale. Atomizers typically need to be replaced every week if you are a heavy smoker and every three weeks if you are a light smoker.If you use flavored e-liquids such as fruit flavors with more acidity, you may need to replace your atomizer more frequently., If you find yourself on the road regularly, it is best to purchase a higher end model with a longer battery life. You can also upgrade your vapor cigarette to a higher end battery.


Longer lasting batteries are also literally longer. This can be fine for home use but some people prefer to not have such a long device when smoking during the work day.Consider charging options. You can charge some vapor cigarettes via USB to your computer, and there are also car chargers available if you are driving a lot.If you are upgrading your battery, make sure it is compatible with your existing vapor cigarette. Not all components are necessarily compatible.Check if your battery comes with a warranty., The manual batteries require that you press a button in order to inhale from the vapor cigarette. This helps to preserve battery life, but some people prefer the ease of use of the automatic design."

No nicotine. You can buy vapor cigarettes without any nicotine. These vapor cigarettes mirror the experience of smoking but do not give you any nicotine. If you are a very light or occasional smoker, they may do the trick.
6mg or 0.6% If you are used to smoking ultra light cigarettes, this level of nicotine may suit you well.
12mg or 1.2% If you smoke less than a pack a day of light cigarettes, this level of nicotine may meet your needs.
18mg or 1.8% If you are a pretty regular smoker and up to a pack a day, this may be your best starting point.
24mg or 2.4% If you smoke rolled tobacco or natural brands, you may prefer this level of nicotine.
36mg or 3.6% If you are a very heavy smoker, you may want to start at this level., The jury is still out on the effectiveness of vapor cigarettes in quitting smoking, with existing research highlighting promising but inconclusive resultsHowever, some smokers advocate gradually reducing nicotine levels in vapor cigarettes to wean their bodies off the nicotine habit. Start with a regular amount of nicotine and slowly reduce the amount of nicotine in your vapor cigarette until you get to the no nicotine level.There are smokers who can relinquish and go directly for the ‘no nicotine’ liquid.

Since you are mostly in the front of the car, your dashboard, the tops of the front windows, and the surface of the windows will collect more tar than others. To cover up the smell of the smoke, wash and deodorize these areas often.


If any other part of your car is discolored or sticky, wash these areas as well.
You can keep deodorizing wipes in your car so you can clean these common areas quickly ti hide the smell., Cleaning your floor mats will remove any smoke smells that have been by absorbed the carpet fibers. To clean them, sprinkle baking soda on your mats and let the mixture sit for one hour before vacuuming. You can also shampoo the mats to help cover the smell.


If the mats smell to strongly, you can replace them instead.
You should provide the same treatment to the carpet in your car as well., Citrus is a natural deodorizer that will help cover up and remove smoke smells from your car. Place piles of citrus peels around your car to cover the scent of smoke. You can also clean the inside of your car with a citrus scented cleaner to help with the smell.


Try opening and peeling the fruit inside your car to provide a quick fix for the smoke smell.
Try cleansers with citrus oils in them to make a larger impact on the scent.

, Your air system in your car will retain the smoke smell, which will cause the smell to come out when you use the heat or air conditioning. To help cover up these odors, turn your air conditioning on full blast. Locate your air intake vent, which is typically found under the front fender on the passenger’s side. Spray an air deodorizer into the intake vent. Switch to the heat setting and repeat.


Be sure to air out the car after doing this. If not, the smell of air deodorizer may be too strong or cause breathing problems.Make sure you use deodorizing spray and not just air freshener. This won't help eliminate the odor.

, One way to help make the smell of smoke in your car less obvious is to smoke with your windows open. The smoke will still get int he car, but this will make the smell less obvious and strong than in you smoked with it closed or cracked.


Make sure you blow your smoke out the window as well, so you limit the smoke exposure to the inside of your car., Ashtrays can keep the smoke smell in your car long after you have finished smoking. If you have an ashtray in your car, you need to empty it every time you get out of the car. This will help cover up any strong smoke smell in your car.


You should also clean out the ashtray with a deodorizing cleanser to get rid of the smell as well."

Grab your cigarette with your thumb and middle fingers.,
Tap lightly on the top of the cigarette with your index finger.,
Flick the cigarette multiple times.",How to Ash Your Cigarette2," The cigarette should be held at its filter with the index finger hovering above. The grip should be firm without crushing the filter in the process.

, Be sure not to tap it too hard or else the cigarette will bend a bit or break. Avoid touching the ash or the point where the cigarette is lit so you don’t burn yourself.

, This method doesn’t provide a great amount of pressure on the cigarette so it’s likely that you’ll have to “ash” it multiple times. Always find a proper place to ash that doesn’t damage yours or someone else’s property.

"
"
Rest the cigarette in between your index and middle finger.,
Hold it over the ashtray.,
Use your thumb to tap the cigarette on the edge of the ashtray.",How to Ash Your Cigarette3," This starting position is similar to the one used in the thumb flick method where your middle finger serves as the fulcrum while the index finger holds it in place. Keep the pressure between your fingers strong enough to hold the cigarette in place, but avoid squeezing too hard so you don’t split it in half. , Make sure the cigarette is only an inch or so above the edge of the ashtray, with the tip of the cigarette hovering over the inside of it. This way the ash falls in the ashtray, instead of falling outside of it. This common pitfall could damage the table the ashtray is on and make you look like a novice. , Use the top of thumbnail to strike the bottom of the filter, causing the front of the cigarette to hit downward on the ashtray. Make sure the cigarette hits the side of the ashtray because it provides a solid surface to loosen the ash. The impact with the ashtray should cause your cigarette to ash.

"
"
Use this method at bars or at home.,
Hold the cigarette between thumb and index finger.,
Turn the cigarette upside down over the bottle’s opening.,
Put the cigarette inside the bottle.,
Make it quick.",How to Ash Your Cigarette4," This trick is great if you need to ash into an empty beer bottle or any glass bottle. It’s especially useful because the bottle acts a receptacle for the ash, so you can just throw your ash away with the bottle after you’re finished. Make sure you’re done with your beverage so you don’t end up drinking ash, which could have dangerous health effects. , In this grip you’re firmly holding it at the filter but not forcefully enough where the filter becomes crushed. Hold the cigarette upright as the ash will easily fall down if it’s pointed downwards., Be careful that the tip of the cigarette is hovering over the bottle so the ash falls straight into the bottle. Keep the bottle stationary as well to ensure the ash doesn’t fall anywhere else.

, Flick the bottom of the filter with the fingernail on your middle finger. This will cause the tip of the cigarette to hit the inside of bottle, causing the ash to fall inside the bottle.

, Flicking the cigarette over for too long while cause it to burn more quickly. It might take a few times to get the ash in the bottle, so make sure to flick the cigarette with enough force to loosen the ash up in a couple tries.

"
"
Hold the cigarette filter between your thumb and index finger.,
Place lit end of cigarette directly on the ashtray.,
Roll the cigarette between your thumb and index finger, pressing it against the loose ash in the ashtray.",How to Ash Your Cigarette5," Keep the tip of the cigarette pointed upwards so stray ash doesn’t fall down. Ensure the grip is light but firm, allowing the cigarette to stay in place without crushing the filter. , Have the cigarette hover over the center of the ashtray with a roughly 45 degree angle between cigarette and ashtray surface. Don’t point the lit end of the cigarette downward until you’re directly over the ashtray, ensuring the ash falls directly in.

, Put the lit end of the cigarette in the center of the ashtray, and roll it between your fingers without actually moving it back and forth. The cigarette will naturally rest on the unburnt tobacco on the cigarette tip when it makes contact with the ashtray. By rolling the cigarette you brush off the majority of the loose ash, as well as making a smooth, symmetrical, and sophisticated cigarette.

Tell them you are on the patch.,
Tell them you don't give out cigarettes because they kill people and it's bad enough you smoke, and you're seriously considering quitting.,
Be up front with them.,
This is down and dirty but if you know the person has a smoking related health condition, use that as a defense.,
Tell them you have only one cigarette left and you need it.,
Try the menthol defense.,
Consider if they are trying to quit.,
Make a point to bum cigarettes off of them when they have them.,
Ask your smoking buddies what they would do in your situation.,
Call them before meeting them out.,
Use the ""I bummed this one"" defense.

,
Give them a pack for their birthday or a gifting holiday.,
Consider switching brands, even if just for going out with the person, especially if you're a girl and a guy is the culprit.,
If you can, smoke a hand-rolled or other unfiltered cigarette.,
Make a joke out of it.,
Give the cigarette on the condition of getting one back later.",How to Deal With People Who Grub Cigarettes," Obviously if you're smoking at the time this won't work. Don't tell them you have quit, because if they do see you smoking they'll know you're lying. But, every smoker knows that if you're in the process of quitting sometimes you might indulge the craving.;
, Lie, if necessary.

, Tell them they seem to always ask you for a butt, and ask them why that is. Depending on their response, give them a rational argument on why smoking yours isn't the solution.


Example: I don't have money for cigarettes right now. Tell them that you don't have enough money to keep giving them your cigarettes. If they offer to pay you for one cigarette, tell them to save the money until they can buy a pack. If they say they only need one, tell them that they can quit if all they need is one cigarette.

, Tell them that you know they have that condition from smoking and you don't feel right giving them cigarettes because of it.

, Alternatively, tell them it's your last pack and it's got to last you until payday. Seem really apologetic.

, Tell them you smoke menthols if it isn't someone who knows your preference. Many people won't smoke a menthol, but the desperate will, so be careful. Always back up the menthol defense with another one if it doesn't work because if you don't smoke menthol and give them a cigarette they'll know you're lying. You can get around this by actually smoking menthol cigarettes.

, They may have stopped buying to try to quit smoking. If that's the case and it becomes a problem you should remind them they bum smokes when they drink (meet out, etc.) and should pick up a pack on the way.

, If they balk after a few times you can remind them you ""know how it feels"". If they're fine with sharing, you can at least try to break even.

, Smokers will tell you what they do, even strangers who are smokers. Seriously, if you don't have a light you can pretty much go up to any smoker and ask for one and you'll get it.

, Say you're running late and ask them to pick up a pack of cigarettes for you on the way. Hopefully they will buy their own but if you're in doubt you should suggest it.

,, Make a joke to them that it should last them a while so you can get a break.

, Take a pack of a brand that is particularly skinny or girlie.

, Many smokers, even hardened chain smokers, feel these are far too strong. However, they may be too strong for you as well at first. They are also worse for your health, because without a filter, more smoke gets into your lungs. One last benefit is even if people do still bum them off you, rolling tobacco and papers are amazingly cheap compared to regular cigarettes.

, Most moochers will take the hint if they're called out a few times. Try these as a greeting or when with these grubbing friends. Make sure you let other victimized friends in on the plan to call them out so they can join in. Try one of the following passive aggressive ""hints"":


""I suppose you'd like to mooch a cigarette""
""Certainly you aren't still out of cigarettes and about to ask me for one""
""____ is coming! Hide your cigarettes!""
""If I'm supplying the smokes, you're buying the beer.""
""You know, you passed about 10 stores today, so don't walk over here and mooch my last smoke"".
""You know, they sell these in stores. You should consider investing in your own.""
""Hey, I'm almost out too, here's a few bucks, grab me a pack when you get yours.""

, If things still seem unbalanced, start keeping a tab - once it reaches a pack take them out and make them buy you one. If they refuse, refuse to give them any more cigarettes.

Collect 3 ""D"" (or 4 ""C"") batteries (laid end to end in a line) and a length of electrical wire which exceeds the total length of the batteries by a few inches.,
Strip the insulation from the wire's ends.,
Form a flat spiral disc with the 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of exposed wire (see picture).,
Fasten the spiral end of the wire to the (-) terminal of one of the batteries.,
Cut the cardboard tube lengthwise.,
Put the battery (the one with the wire already attached) into the tube with the negative terminal facing down towards the folded end.,
Make a male electrical connector for the ecig cartridge (you may be able to skip this step if your cartridge already has a male connector).,
Connect the alligator clip to the outer ring terminal of the cartridge.",How to Cheaply Improvise an E Cig,";
, For stranded wiring you'll want to twist the exposed strands back into a single cord. Remove 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) from one end and an inch or so of insulation from the other end.

, Attach an alligator clip to other end of the wire. Secure the connection by crimping it w/ pliers.

, Secure it in place with some electrical tape.

, Tighten the tube's diameter to a width that can accommodate the batteries with a snug fit. Secure the tube's width by folding up the bottom end and stapling it shut at the crease. Put a rubber band around the top of the tube.

, Position the wire so that the alligator clip sticks out the top of the cardboard tube - you can use the rubber band to hold the clip in place. Insert the remaining batteries into the tube in the same order (-+;-+;-+;-+) as the first one.

, The V2 cartridge's shown in the pictures have female connectors. You can improvise a male connector by wrapping a screw (which will be the center terminal) with insulating tape and then cutting a ""T"" shaped piece of sheet metal and bending it to fit between the cartridge's outer terminal and around the taped core of the center terminal. So long as the center terminal (in this case the screw or nail) is electrically insulated from the outer ring it'll work fine. Also shown is the male connector from an NJOY cartridge being used as a female to male adaptor for the V2 cartridge.

, To use the ecig, just touch the cartridge's center lead (the screw) to the positive terminal of the battery at the top of the cardboard tube when you draw on the cartridge mouthpiece. It makes a distinct sizzling noise. But don't allow it to contact the battery terminal when not in use - the filament inside the cartridge will overheat. Nor should you allow the alligator clip itself to contact the top battery since that will short the circuit. Make adjustments such as strategically tearing the cardboard, bending the wire, and moving the rubber band such that the cartridge's central shaft does not normally touch the battery at the top of the tube.

Pour water into the base.,
Assemble the hookah.,
Test the airflow.,
Drop shisha lightly into the bowl.,
Cover the bowl with a screen or foil.,
Poke holes in the foil.,
Light a couple of coals.,
Warm the bowl.,
Smoke gently.,
Adjust the heat.,
Change the water temperature.,
Add other contents to the base.,
Try different shishas.,
Switch coal brands.,
Try different equipment.",How to Smoke Shisha from a Hookah Pipe," This basic overview will help you follow the process. The bolded words describe the main parts of the hookah.


The bowl at the top of the hookah will hold the shisha tobacco, with hot coals above it.
Air sucked through the hookah will heat the coals, light the tobacco, and bring the smoke down through the main shaft.
The smoke leaves the stem at the end of the shaft, and enters the glass base of the hookah.
The smoke travels through water and air in the base, becoming cooler and more dilute.
The smoke moves through the hose and into your lungs.;
, Cleaning before the first use and after each smoking session will keep off-flavors out of your smoke. Wash all components with soapy water, except for the hoses. Most hoses will rust or rot if they become wet.Clean glass components with warm or cold water. Hot water can crack glass.

, Take a look through the glass base and make a note of where the stem ends. Now detach the shaft and pour cold water directly into the base. When reassembled, the tip of the stem should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) below the surface of the water.









Too much water can get pulled into your hoses and ruin them. Always leave a layer of air at the top of the hookah.

, Fit the shaft onto the base, the hoses into the holes on the side of the shaft. Every connection should have a rubber or silicone ""grommet"" to make the fit snug and airtight. Test the connection between the bowl and the top of the shaft as well, then remove the bowl for now.









Attach all the hoses even if you will only use one of them. This guarantees that the shaft is sealed.

, Place your hand over the top of the shaft, blocking the entire hole. Try to inhale through one of the hoses. If you get anything more than a trickle, there's a leak somewhere in your hookah. Check all the connections again and adjust as follows:


If a grommet won't fit snugly, wet it and try again.
If the connection between the shaft and the base isn't airtight, wrap the shaft with masking tape where it fits onto the shaft. Add layers of tape until it fits snugly but is still easy to remove.
If another connection won't fit, wrap it in aluminum foil or moist paper towels. If using moist paper near the hoses, remember to dry them right after smoking.

, Open your container of shisha and stir the contents until all the tobacco is moist and clump-free. Sprinkle small pinches into the bowl, trying to avoid clogging the holes. Add more pinches until the bowl is about ¾ full. Press it very lightly to make an even layer.If you pack the shisha down too hard, it will be difficult to pull air through it.


If you see any tobacco stems, pick them out. If your shisha has many stems, pour it onto a plate after packing and pick them all out, then pack the bowl again.

, Your hookah might come with a screen or glass ""gauze"" that sits over the bowl, which needs no extra preparation. Most experienced smokers prefer to replace this with a piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil instead, which reduces overheating and gives more control. Stretch the foil over the bowl, pulling gently at opposite edges to make it as taut as possible. Once taut, gently pull down on all sides of the foil until the surface is smooth and flat. Wrap the foil around the sides until secured.Make sure the shisha is low enough to avoid touching the foil, or your smoke will have a burned taste
If you don't have heavy-duty foil, use two layers of normal duty foil instead.

, More holes (or larger holes) means more hot air flowing through the shisha. You'll need to experiment to find the balance between getting enough smoke and avoiding harsh, overheated shisha. Here are some guidelines to get you started:








If poking holes with a toothpick or paper clip, start with 15 holes. If you only have a fine-tipped pen or charcoal tongs, start with 4–7 holes instead due to the larger size.
For an Egyptian (circular) bowl, start poking around the outer edge and spiral inwards. For a funnel (donut-shaped) bowl, poke three concentric circles between the outer and inner rims.
Add more holes only if you aren't getting enough smoke. Some people like 50 or more small holes, especially with dense, sticky tobacco.

, Hookah coals and bowls vary in size. A typical bowl requires two medium coals, but you can use ½ less or 1 more if that doesn't produce the right amount of smoke.Always use smokeless, self-lighting coals, never charcoal briquettes or anything that requires lighter fluid; these can poison you.There are two types of hookah-appropriate coals. Handle both types with small tongs over a non-flammable surface, and light as follows:








Quick light coals light within 10–30 seconds in a match or lighter flame. Once finished sputtering, let it burn until coated in white-grey ash. Blow on it until it glows orange.
Natural coals are less likely to add harsh flavors, burn your shisha, or give you a headache. Light them on an electric stove burner or in an open flame until glowing orange, about ten minutes. Blow on the coals and flip once while lighting to heat evenly. (Avoid glass-top stoves and gas stoves where ash might fall into the gas line.)

, Attach the bowl to the top of the shaft. Place the hot coals on top of the foil, near the edge. Space the coals as evenly as possible. For best results, give the shisha a few minutes to warm up before you begin.

, Draw air through the hose with full breaths, but a normal breathing pace. A strong inhale will just overheat the shisha, adding harsh burned flavors. To avoid overheating as well as ""hookah sickness"" when just starting out, wait a minute or two between each inhale. These tips will also help you avoid an unpleasant reaction to the nicotine:








Drink plenty of water before you begin. Drink water or mint tea as you smoke to keep your mouth moist, or you may stop tasting the smoke.Eat light snacks such as bread and dried fruit as you smoke.
Stick to a maximum of one bowl a day as a beginner.
Avoid exercise immediately before and after smoking.

, Most bowls last 30–45 minutes, but the smoke often declines in quality before then due to smoking too quickly, low quality equipment, or just bad luck. These adjustments help the shisha heat slowly and evenly, so you can maximize your enjoyment:


Move the coals about every 10–15 minutes. Tap them with the tongs to knock off ash, then flip them over so the other side is against the foil.If you see smoke rise from the bowl before you inhale, remove the coals and let the hookah cool down., Compare a smoke with cold water and ice cubes to a smoke with warm water. Most find cold water smoother, but warm water may filter harsh particles more effectively, so not everyone agrees., To explore new flavors, add fruit juice, wine, frozen fruit, flavored extracts, or breath mints to the water.If using a liquid (besides extracts, which only need a few drops), you can try anything from a light splash to completely replacing the water.


Milk and carbonated beverages tend to bubble up, getting in the hoses and leaving a permanent, nasty stink. Let carbonated drinks go flat before you use them. If you want to risk milk, using a small splash in the water only.
Never drink or eat the contents. The liquid filters out many harmful chemicals.
Always clean the hookah thoroughly right after using anything besides water.

, Shisha comes in many flavors, which are a matter of personal preference. You can also tell a little about how the material will burn based on its consistency:Herbal molasses is tobacco-free. This is a nice place for beginners to start, since it has no nicotine and is hard to burn. It won't last as long, so use fewer coals than usual (or place them farther from the center).
Shisha with a ""shredded"" appearance is the most basic type. Smoke as described above.
Shisha with a sticky, ""pureed"" appearance may take a larger coal or a longer warmup time to get started. Once heated, it should produce nice, thick smoke.
Leafier tobacco tends to have a stronger tobacco flavor. Many of these (such as Tangiers or Nakhla) are finicky specialty products. Ask an experienced hookah fan for advice or look up a more specific guide.

, Most novice hookah smokers start with convenient quick light coals. Once you've become a hookah hobbyist, it might be worth switching to a natural coal. These can be made from lemon wood, coconut hair, bamboo, and other ingredients, each with its own flavor.

, Experienced hookah smokers try to find the right combination of equipment, shisha, and techniques that produce the smoke they enjoy. Since there's no one right answer, talk to other hookah enthusiasts in your community or online. These can recommend specific brands and types of bowl or hookah based on the kind of shisha and smoking experience you enjoy.

Fill your bong with water.,
Pack the bowl of your bong with your smoking substance.,
Put your mouth on the top of the chamber.,
Put your finger on the carb.,
Ignite your substance while you simultaneously inhale.,
Suck with good strength until the chamber fills with smoke.,
If the bong has a carb, take your finger off of it or pull out the bowl piece.,
Inhale the rest of the smoke.,
Hold the smoke in your lungs for several seconds, and then exhale completely.

,
Replace the carb and pass the bong to the person to your left if you are smoking socially.

",How to Smoke from a Bong," Pour just enough so that the stem is submerged in about 1/2 to one inch of water. The water will enter from the top of the chamber, the cylindrical tube that you also inhale the smoke from.


If there is too much water in your bong, it will splash up and possibly get in your mouth or drench the substance while you are inhaling.
Avoid this situation, as bong water can be extremely unpleasant when it splashes in your face.
Add ice to the chamber of the bong to chill the smoke as it rises through the chamber. Some smokers claim that this makes the smoke feel smoother as you inhale.;
, The bowl is the tablespoon-sized, well, bowl, on the side of the bong. Most bowls are removable and act as the carb for your bong, which you will need to remove later on in the smoking process to clear the smoke.


Pack the bowl full to just under the rim of the bowl with your broken up or ground up substance. You can break your substance up by tearing with your fingers, cutting with scissors, or using a grinder specifically designed for marijuana or tobacco.
Avoid packing too little, as very small grinds may get sucked through the bong as you smoke. Conversely, if you overpack the bowl, you may clog it and prevent air from getting through.

, Your lips should go inside the rim of the mouthpiece, not around it.


Avoid slobbering all over the mouthpiece. Doing so is bad etiquette, and let's face it, gross.
Make sure your mouth is firmly pressing into the mouthpiece so as to avoid allowing air to escape as you smoke.

, Some bongs have carbs that are simply holes located on the side of the bong or the bong stem. If you are smoking out of this style bong, cover the hole with one finger before lighting the bowl.


Many bongs do not have carbs. In the case that your bong does not have a carb, you will remove the bowl piece once you have filled the chamber with smoke.
If the bowl piece is not removable, you will not perform the carb function at all. It is not completely necessary for smoking from a bong.

, Hold a lighter or a match to the substance in the bowl as you inhale through your mouth with your lips on the inside of the chamber. You can release the fire as soon as the substance begins to glow red, which is called being ""cherried"" because of the red hue.

, You can take as big of a hit or as small of a hit as you want at this point. If it is your first time smoking, try only filling the chamber about halfway with smoke. Otherwise, ""milk"" the bong until the chamber is white with smoke.

, Doing so removes the substance and allows the smoke to clear out of the bong without resistance.


If you need to take a break from inhaling at any point, cover the mouthpiece with the palm of your hand before removing the carb.






If you take a break after removing the carb, some smoke will start to escape from the chamber.

, You do not have to suck hard to remove the smoke from the chamber after removing the carb because there will be no resistance.

Swab with alcohol after a few smokes.",How to Smoke a Tobacco Pipe," Part of the pleasure of smoking pipes is the ability to create your own perfect experience. Take your time browsing a tobacconist's shop for aesthetically pleasing options. Heft each pipe in your hand — a lightweight pipe is almost always more comfortable.If you're at a complete loss, ask the employees for recommendations.


Even an attractive wooden pipe can have hidden flaws — and probably does if it comes with a low price tag. If price is your main concern, a corncob pipe is a safer bet.
A metal filter in the stem can absorb moisture and perhaps alter the flavor. This is a matter of personal preference, and the filter should be removable if you change your mind.;
, Nothing disrupts a smoke like a malfunctioning pipe. Avoid frustration with a quick inspection before you buy:Avoid pipes with walls thinner than ¼ inch (6mm), about the width of a pencil. The base should be at least this thick as well; to measure this, put a straight pipe cleaner down the chamber, pinch it at the top of the chamber, then compare this height to the outside wall.
Stick a pipe cleaner down the stem. It should run smoothly through and emerge very close to the base of the chamber.
Although there are exceptions, thick varnishes may flake and bubble from heat after heavy use.

, You'll need more than a pipe to start smoking. If you visit a pipe shop, get everything at once to avoid multiple trips and hassle. You'll also need:


A lighter or matches. Plastic butane lighters are cheap and plentiful but some smokers dislike the smell and taste. Pipe lighters are available for a variety of prices, but it might be a good idea to start with a good supply of wooden matches. You can always invest in a pipe lighter later.
A bundle of pipe cleaners to keep your pipe clean and functioning properly.
Pipe tamper. This is used to pack the tobacco in the bowl.

, Walking into a tobacco store can be overwhelming at first. Cyprian Latakia? Dutch Cavendish? Fortunately, a quick lesson should be enough for your first purchase:Aromatic blends (sometimes called American) have added flavors. Most beginners prefer these milder, sweeter options.
Non-aromatic blends are pure tobacco, typically with a strong, spicy taste. ""English blends"" are non-aromatic blends that include Latakia, a powerful, smoky variety.
Any tobacco can go through a ""Cavendish"" process to make it sweeter and lighter.
If possible, purchase two or three small sample tins so you can try a range of options.

, Tobacco is sold in various shapes and sizes. There are many cuts and many ways to prepare them, but these are good beginner options:Ribbon cut tobacco comes in long, thin, ribbons, which can be placed directly in the bowl.
Flake cut tobacco comes in thick strips, or irregular broken pieces. Either way, rub it between your fingers until it breaks apart into small pieces.

, Pipe smoking is a leisurely activity. Take some time to yourself in a comfortable spot where you won't be disturbed, and where your smoke won't disturb anyone else.


If you're smoking a new briar pipe, smoke indoors away from drafts. Even gentle wind will cause the pipe to burn hotter, which can damage a briar pipe before it's ""broken in.""This is not necessary for most other pipes, including corncob pipes.

, A drink on hand keeps your mouth and throat from drying out, and may prevent a sore tongue.Some people enjoy pairing pipes with coffee or tea instead, but wait on that until you are more experienced, and can choose a good pairing.


Drinking alcohol before or during a smoke is not recommended, since it greatly increases smoke-related cancer risk., Before each smoke, run a pipe cleaner through the stem and tap out the remnants of ash and tobacco., Correct packing takes practice, and has a major impact on your enjoyment. The tobacco should be loose enough that you can easily draw air through it, and springy to the touch. Have an experienced smoker show you what to do, or use this beginner-friendly method:Drop a tiny pinch of tobacco in the chamber. Tamp this very lightly or not at all, leaving plenty of air between the leaves.
Add a slightly larger pinch, tamping lightly until the bowl is half-filled.
Finish with a third pinch, tamping with a bit more pressure until there is a gap of ¼ inch (0.6mm) above the tobacco.

Note — when breaking in a new briar pipe, many people fill to ⅓ or ½ the depth described here the first few smokes. This helps form a protective cake of charcoal, although not all smokers agree with this approach., If using a match, let the sulfur burn off for a few seconds first to avoid getting a mouthful of match taste. Move the flame around the surface of the tobacco while drawing on the mouthpiece with long, even draws.If the pipe goes out right away — which is common — just tamp it down gently and light the same way., Most pipe smokers draw smoke into their mouth by sucking gently, or moving their tongue back along the palate.Some beginners and cigarette smokers inhale instead, but it's best to keep the the smoke in your mouth, not your lungs. Hold the pipe bowl in your hand as you smoke for the first time. Draw just often enough to keep the pipe lit, without making the pipe too hot to hold.A minority of pipe smokers do enjoy the occasional inhale, which gives more of a nicotine buzz. Pipe smoke is much stronger and thicker than a cigarette, so stick with a gentle pull and limit yourself to one or two inhales per bowl.
Avoiding inhalation does make lung cancer less likely, but there is still a high risk of oral cancers from long-term use., If the pipe goes out, just tamp again and relight. The ash surface is actually beneficial, and there's no need to dump it out until it's thick enough to prevent lighting. When this happens, tap out about half of the ash by knocking the pipe against a cork knocker, your hand, or another soft object., Once you're done smoking, let the pipe cool. If you didn't finish the bowl, tamp down the tobacco to extinguish it.


Never take apart the pipe while it is still warm. This may crack the stem.

, There are two different approaches for this, based on the type of pipe:


Briar pipes need a charcoal buildup (a ""cake"") to protect the wood. Cover the bowl and shake the ash around to loosen it and distribute it around the bowl of the pipe. With your finger, rub the ash into the walls of the bowl. Dump the remnants out.For other pipes, most smokers prefer them kept clean. Shake out the ash, then wipe the bowl with a paper towel or pipe cleaner. (Meerschaum pipes especially should never be allowed to cake heavily.)

, Take off the stem and stick a pipe cleaner through it to remove moisture and residue. Do the same with the shank of the pipe, leading down to the chamber.

, Take off the stem of the pipe. Moisten a pipe cleaner slightly (saliva works fine) and push through the shank until you can just see the end at the bottom of the bowl. Repeat this process a few times, alternating by gently blowing through the stem to clear any loosened ash. Repeat for the stem., This gives time for the moisture in the pipe to evaporate, preventing difficult draws and gurgling noises.If you want to smoke more often, add a second pipe to your collection.
You can leave a pipe cleaner in the pipe to absorb any remaining moisture as it rests.

, A pipe cleaner or cotton swab dipped in alcohol will remove gunk that can block airflow or affect flavor. Follow it with a dry pipe cleaner to remove the moisture. Some pipe cleaners do this after each smoke, and others don't bother with it at all. If you stick with the habit, ask a fellow smoker for help identifying the signs of a dirty pipe.

Inhale.",How to Set Up a Hookah," Wash the hookah with water and a soft brush before using it for the first time, and whenever it gets dirty. Disconnect all parts first, and wash every one except the hoses; assume these are not water-safe unless labeled otherwise.Wipe it dry with a towel and leave it to air dry before you continue.


Cleaning after every session is ideal, but definitely clean whenever you see residue on the vase, or when the smoke doesn't taste right.
A long, thin brush helps you reach inside long parts. You might find good brushes at stores that sell hookahs.;
, This is the large glass container at the base of the hookah. Fill it enough to cover 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the metal stem, or slightly more. Leaving space for air is important to dilute the smoke and make it easy to draw on the hose. If you have a mini hookah, you may only be able to cover ½ inch (1.25cm) of the stem to leave room for air and avoid soaking the hoses.The stem is the metal tip at the bottom of the central hookah shaft. Slot the shaft on top of the vase to see how far down the stem goes.
The water doesn't filter out nicotine and other chemicals nearly as much as most smokers believe. Adding more water won't make the hookah safer.

, Although hookah smoke, properly drawn, is not harsh at all, a nice cool temperature will make it even more pleasurable. You may need to pour out some of the water to adjust it to the correct level, as described above.

, Lower the shaft into the base, so the stem enters the water. There should be a silicone or rubber piece that fits around the top of the base to make it airtight. If the fit isn't airtight, the smoke will be thin and difficult to pull.


If the rubber piece won't fit, wet it with a little water or a drop of dish soap.

, The hoses slot into holes on the side of the shaft. Just like the base, these holes should be airtight fits. Some hookahs seal the hole if there is no hose attached. On other models, you'll need to attach all the hoses even if you're smoking alone.


Double check your water levels before connecting. If the water levels are too near your hose connections, the water could ruin your hoses.

, Place your hand on top of the hookah stem to block air from entering the hookah. Try to inhale through a hose. If you can get any air, one of the connections is not airtight. Check them all for tight fits and rubber or silicone seals.


If you're missing a seal, look for ""hookah grommets"" to find a replacement. Tightly wrapped athletic tape can make a temporarily, mostly airtight seal., This tray catches hot embers and excess tobacco if and when they fall.

, Shisha is just tobacco packed in liquids that add flavor and thick smoke. These liquids tend to settle to the bottom, so give it a quick stir to spread them around.


For your first time smoking a hookah, consider using tobacco-free hookah molasses to practice the setup. Tobacco can be very harsh if you make a mistake.Shisha comes in many different flavors, which significantly change the experience. Sample several to see what you like as a novice hookah smoker.

, Fluff up pieces of shisha and drop them in the bowl. Press lightly down to make a flat layer without compacting the tobacco. It should stay fairly loose so air can easily flow through it. Fill the bowl nearly to the top, but leave at least 2mm (3/32 inches) of space above the tobacco so it doesn't burn., Lay a piece of heavy-duty foil over the bowl, stretching it taut. Crimp it around the edges to secure.


If you only have standard duty foil, use two layers.
You can use a charcoal screen sold for this purpose instead, but most users prefer the foil.

, This should fit securely into another rubber piece, for an airtight fit.

, Using a toothpick or paper clip, poke about 12–15 holes through the foil surface.Test air flow by drawing on the hose as you do this. If you have trouble pulling air, add more holes.


Some people like to poke all the way through the shisha to provide channels for heat and air.

, There are two types of coals used for hookah. Follow these instructions depending on which one you have:Quick light coals: Hold with tongs over a nonflammable area. Light with a lighter or match until it stops smoking, then wait 10–30 seconds until covered in light gray ash and glowing orange. These are convenient, but give a worse, shorter smoke. Some people even get headaches from smoking them.
Natural coals: Heat directly in a stove flame or on an electric burner, but never where ash could fall into the gas line or on a glass stove. The coal is ready once glowing orange, usually after 8–12 minutes.

, Place the coals evenly ringing the edge of the foil, or even slightly overhanging the edge. A common mistake is to pile the coals in the center, which can easily char the shisha and create harsh, short-lived smoke.


Many smokers prefer to let the shisha warm up for 3–5 minutes before they start smoking. This lets you smoke with gentle breaths, enhancing the flavor.

, Once the bowl is warm — or right away, if you're impatient — inhale through one of the hoses. Your breath pulls air past the coals, causing them to heat up. If you pull too hard, the air will get hot enough to char the shisha, and you'll cough on a lungful of bad-tasting smoke. Pull with short, normal breaths. Smoke at a relaxed rate, pausing to give the shisha time to cool down.


If no smoke appears in the vase, inhale in a series of short, sharp puffs to light the tobacco.

Review the diagram.,
Gather the supplies you'll need:

Sharp shears to trim the screen
A 7/32 inch (5.5 mm), 6-mm or 1/4 inch (6.3 mm) (hex end diameter) socket from a socket wrench set.,
Make the screen.,
Install the screen into the crater: with a 3/16"" flat-ended stick or tube wedge it about 3/16 inch (5 mm) down into the hex end of the socket piece.,
Insert the draw tube.,Seal over the resulting crack between socket and draw-tube with tape, eliminating any air leak.,
Decorate and insulate.,
Attach the screen maintenance pin.,
CHOOMette option: wood-handlestick long-stemmed one-hitter.,Keep an inexpensive clean-out kit containing q-tips, prickly pipe cleaners and a small bottle of rubbing alcohol on hand for occasional interior de-clogging to keep your device serviceable.",How to Make Smoke Pipes From Everyday Objects1," A screenshot of finished crater-head, to which a 20 inch/50 cm flexible tube (hookah-hose) is attached.;
,

This is about the correct hex-end crater size to permit a low-temperature 25-mg serving of sifted herb—or 25-mg pinch of the shredded tobacco from any conventional cigarette. (A ""regular"" cigarette contains 700 mg net weight of tobacco, or enough for 28 ""single toke"" servings. A ""beedi"" contains 450 mg, a ""joint"" typically 500-mg.)


Wire mesh #40x40 screen (40 windows per linear inch), any kind of metal but aluminum.-- With strong sharp shears, cut the screen into 7/16 inch (11 cm) squares. If you are buying round, pre-cut screens, look for 7/16 inch (11 cm) diameter, mesh-40, and proceed as described below—though you will not need to cut away as much corner wire.

A 3/16 inch (4.7-mm) outer diameter flat-ended stick or metal tube-segment for pre-shaping screen
A flat-ended 1/8-inch-diam. or narrower Allen wrench, tube segment, blunt nail, etc. long enough to stick through from the other end of the socket, and expel from the socket (or other screen-shaping device), the newly-shaped screen.
20 inch (50 cm) of 1/4 inch-outer-diameter flexible tube-- a food-grade PVC product is widely available
A 2-inch (5cm) safety pin, sharp enough to use for gently clearing ash from screen windows by scratching screen each time before next use, strong enough for (rarely) leveraging out the screen to clean utensil interior.
Some salvaged 20th-century 1-mm-o.d. solid-core, color-code-shielded landline phone wire-- see demolition companies about last-minute access to old buildings with a ladder to harvest it in the large wire cables which run to where office phones used to be. Or buy it from the demo company before they sell it to scrappers! You should have lots of this wire on hand for millions of craft uses, which can also be taught to children, seniors, etc., use some and distribute some to day care centers, schools, crafts organizations etc.

Electrical tape, for sealing leak at junction between both parts of the one-heater-- the craterhead and the drawtube. Try green or other decorative color.
Choomette Option: a piece of wood 4 inches long, up to an inch thick, which can be slightly conical, can be made into the ""choomhandle"", i.e. handlestick on a ""Choomette"" one-heater, with the socket wrench crater-head at the top end and a flexible drawtube attached to the butt end.

, (More details in preparation at ""Make a 1/4""-diam. Screen for a Single-Toke Utensil""!). Cut, reshape and trim a 7/16-inch square screen into something resembling an upside-down bottle cap about 1/4 inch in diameter with sides 1/8 inch high:

Press it into the 7/32 inch (5.5 mm), 6.0 mm or 1/4 inch hex end of the socket piece.
Use a 1/8"" (3-mm)-diameter flatted end wood stick, Allen wrench, nail or other blunt object to push it out, pressing through from the opposite end of the socket.
Trim away four remaining sticking-up wire tufts with shears, creating neat even sides that stick up exactly 1/8 inch all the way around the resulting cup-shaped screen.

, (Option: a small metal ring (or piece of screening shaped into a ring) pushed down first and fitting snugly against the walls may be helpful to support the screen at this height since most sockets are slightly deeper than 3/16"".), Push the 1/4""-outer-diameter draw tube into the opposite, square 1/4""-wide ""driver"" end hole of the socket as far as it goes. If your drawtube is a little loose, wrap a bit of tape around the last half inch to make it fit snugger.,, Wrap 1-mm solid-core insulated phonewire around this taped area several times forming a secure grip (and tightening the air-leak closure), then form a 5-inch double wire-braid leading out to where the 2 inch safety pin is to be fastened, leaving two wire-leads about 1-1/2 inch (4.5-cm) long at the end of the braid. This total operation will require one or two pieces of phonewire adding up to a little less than two feet/50-cm., With the two leads, wrap 5 loops of wire through the eye of the safety pin like little fingers, two going through one way and three the other, then wrap both wireleads tightly around the braid itself, forming a sort of thick wrist.

Use the firmly attached nearby handy safety pin to make your smoking utensil more practical and permanent, by gently scratch-clearing the screen passageways before the next 25-mg serving, while sucking air through the drawtube (don't worry, the ashes are nutritious). Occasionally, after first flame-heating the crater to loosen tars, carefully lever the screen out for an occasional internal-passage cleaning with an alcohol-moistened prickly pipecleaner. If your pin is too small and weak to pry out a screen, use a file-sharpened nail that can also be attached to the main device via a wirebraid, or kept with other supplies where you will find it when needed.

, Drill a four-inch (10-cm)-long, trimmed, sanded, carved, painted, etc. wood piece (something about the size of a traditional ""chillum"") so that

(a) one end-- the thicker top-part-- has an opening just the right width to fit the bottom (square-hole, or ""driver"") end of your socket wrench tightly in it, and
(b) the other end-- the narrower-- has a quarter-inch hole into which a quarter-inch-o.d. flexible tube (such as food-grade PVC) fits snugly. If you have a different diameter of flexible hose for the drawtube, drill a butt-hole sized to match it. If insert-hole is too loose, dab latex glue on the wood inside the hole and let dry; or wrap a half-inch of the insert end of the drawtube with tape.

The advantage of having your socket wrench craterpiece embedded in a wood handle is that you can remove it to clean the screen from underneath every so often, and never remove the screen from the crater.

";
,Study this diagram of the crater-head of a screened socket-wrench ""one-hitter"", designed for 25-mg servings of sifted herb particles (including re-sifted tobacco flakes rescued from a 700-mg ""conventional"" cigarette-- twenty-eight single servings).,First make sure all buds, leaves or loose herb are of proper dryness.,Have three wire screen strainers, one with 1/8"" windows (Mesh 8), one with 1/16"" (Mesh 16) and one with about 1/30"" (Mesh 30).,
Break buds or clumps between thumb and finger, grinding in a rotary direction separating loosened herb flakes from stems (which can be saved to make tea).,Folding your catch paper to a spout, dump all loose herb material into the Mesh-#8 sifter with a paper beneath it, and grind with your fingers rotary-wise against the wire-screening until, in a few minutes, everything is broken down and passed through except hard clump materials such as seeds and stems (usually only harsh-burning cellulose, not suited for smoking but which can be saved to make tea).,
Dump all captured loose sifted herb in the #16 sifter and shake vigorously sideways until nothing more passes through.,Finger-grind the rest of the herb until there are few, hard pieces left (for tea) and put the catch paper with this grind-through fraction near a container labeled ""16-grind"".,Optionally you can grind the rest of the herb down (grind hard)-- name this fraction ""16-late-grind"".,Remaining unsifted chunks may be added to the tea fraction as above.,
Then, in turn, shake each of the above fractions (16-shake, 16-grind etc.),
If the herb you are sifting is an inexpensive variety (i.e.,16-shake you may serve at a party where time must not be lost cleaning the screen after each toke.,16-grind you may carry around with you in case it should be necessary to sacrifice any herb as a bribe to some less than trustworthy person.,16-late-grind can be saved to toke if you run out of anything better, or added to tea with the earlier out siftings described above.",How to Sift Herbs for Smoking Use,",,,, Do this with a sheet of paper underneath to catch all the goods.,, Lay the catch paper aside near an ultimate container labeled ""16-shake"".,,,, in the Mesh-30 sifter. Combine the fine, dusty results in a container, ""30-shake"". (In cannabis, this part is known as ""keef"".), not cannabis), the 30-shake fraction need not be smoked (it tends to clog the screen of your smoking utensil, so you'd need to keep a safety pin handy for frequent unclogging operations), but can instead be added as a flavoring to your next crock pot of veggie stew.,,,"

Make a hole in the cap of a 1 liter Plastic bottle.,
Place a socket in the cap.,
Make your carb.,
Fill the bottle with some water.",How to Make a Waterfall Bong1," This is about the size of the large soda bottles you can buy at a grocery store.Poke a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) hole into the cap of a 20 ounce bottle with a sharp object like a knife or sharp pen. It needs to be big enough to fit the bottom of the quarter inch socket but not so big that the socket falls all the way through.The bottom of the socket is the smaller cylindrical portion. This part should poke down through the bottle cap if the cap is on the bottle.


The larger bowl portion of the socket will act as a bottleneck and brace against the bottle cap to stop it from falling into the bottle.
It would be best to start with a smaller hole and make it larger, because if you make it too big you’ll need an entirely new cap.;
, You can buy a small socket wrench piece at any hardware sore. The socket will be the part of the bong that you put your herbs into eventually, which is called the bowl. Put the quarter inch socket into the hole that you just made in the cap.It should fit snugly and not jiggle. You definitely don’t want it to fall into the bottle – the bottle will ultimately be filled with some dirty water after you have smoked it. This socket will be used as your bowl.


Instead of using a bowl you can also roll a joint and stick it in the hole at the top.
If the connection feels a little loose you can stick a bit of gum around the edges to give it a firmer connection. Tape is a little more difficult but could also work.
For an even better seal and overall better hit, consider using a glass bowl and rubber grommet from a real bong.
An easier way to make a bowl is to shape it out using tin foil and just put it over the hole where the cap should go. Poke holes in the tin foil for the smoke to go through.

, The carb is a small hole in a smoking device that you hold shut while you light the herb. When you are ready to take your hit you release your finger from the carb and the pressure change causes all the smoke to rush into your lungs. Examine the bottom of your 1 liter bottle. You should notice a bunch of small notches at the bottom of the bottle that serves as it base. Cut or burn a small hole directly above one of these notches. You don’t need the hole to be very big - just big enough to allow some airflow. This hole serves as your carb. The hole will be on the side of the bottle toward the bottom.


Excessive use of lighter to melt the plastic can makes holes too big and/or plastic too weak.

, Take the cap off and fill your bottle with water. You should fill it to about an inch from the top while holding the carb closed with your finger. This will stop the water from leaking out.


Don’t let go if you are holding the carb with your finger. If you plan to smoke immediately you should fill the socket bowl with weed and get a lighter before you fill the bottle with water.

Obtain a bottle.,
Remove the lid.,
Tear off a small piece of aluminum foil.,
Apply the foil.Wrap the edges of the aluminum foil around the top of the open water bottle.,
Poke holes in the aluminum foil bowl.5 or 6 holes are probably adequate.,
Punch a hole in the side of the bottle.Poke another hole into the outside portion of the water bottle, just above where the label stops.,
Make the side hole bigger with a pair of scissors.,
Pack the bowl.Simply place some of your favorite herb in the aluminum foil bowl.,
Smoke.Cover the hole on the side with your mouth.,
Inhale gently.As you light the bowl and smoke fills the water bottle, set down the lighter and gently inhale the smoke in the bottle.

",How to Make a Water Bottle Bong1," You will want to use a bottle that is just the right size for bong-making purposes. A standard 16.9 ounce plastic water bottle should do the trick.Water bottles are better than soda bottles because they won’t leave any sticky residue.
You can remove the label from the bottle, if you want.
You don’t have to leave any water in the bottle. However, if you want the bong to stand upright, you can leave some in to weigh it down.
This is not a traditional bong, because it does not force the smoke through the water; however, it can be made quickly and easily.;
, Set it aside. You will not need it., This piece will serve as the bowl. It should be approximately 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches (5cm by 5 cm).You should use thick or “heavy duty” aluminum foil for best results.


If you only have lightweight aluminum foil, fold it over to make it thicker before forming a 2.5 inch by 2.5 inch square.
The piece of aluminum foil should be large enough to cover the mouth of the bottle and fold over the edges. Look at your bottle; if 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches doesn’t seem large enough, tear off a larger piece of aluminum foil.

, Press your thumb down to extend the aluminum foil into the center of the opening. It should form a depressed bowl shape in the top of the water bottle.


Make the bowl depression large enough to contain your herb, but don’t push down so hard that you tear the aluminum foil.
Aluminum can be toxic is used improperly, such as by heating, inhaling, or ingesting it., Use a needle, straight pin, toothpick, or other slender object to poke the holes.


Make sure that the holes are far enough apart that they do not break the bowl.
Be careful not to poke holes so large that they break the bowl.

, This is where you will need to place your mouth.


Don’t try to make the hole too big. Gently poke a hole with your needle or straight pin, then wiggle it around a bit to make the hole a little bigger.

, Make it approximately 1 inch (2.5cm) in diameter to start. Be careful not to rip the bottle; press down on the hole to indent the plastic slightly, then gently enlarge the hole.


Start by making the hole a little on the small side. You can always enlarge it later if you need to, but you can’t make it smaller.

, Don’t overdo it; you can always add more later, but you don’t want it spilling over the sides.


If pieces of your herb fall through the bowl, then the holes you punched are too large. Take the aluminum foil off and try again, this time making smaller holes.

, Light the bowl and let the smoke fill the water bottle bong.

Purchase a pipe.,
Purchase some tobacco.,
Purchase pipe cleaners and a pipe nail.,
Get that stuff home and pack her up.,
Light her up.,
After lighting, do not puff fast.,
After that, you can rest and have a conversation or a drink.,
Smoke it until it's gone, or save some for next time.",How to Smoke a Pipe Instead of Cigarettes," Like a first car, don't purchase the best one you can afford. $40 will get you a good starter pipe in any store that sells proper tobacco pipes, or online. Don't buy a pipe at a head shop (""Smoke Shop""). Those are not really for tobacco. Look for a pipe made of briar (a hard dark wood) or meerschaum (a whitish stone). Most tobacco pipes are made of briar, and that is probably your best bet. Do not purchase a pipe made of metal, ceramic, or anything except briar or meerschaum. Don't purchase anything in an extra-large or extra small size. If possible, consult a knowledgeable sales person as to what a good first pipe would be.;
, When they hear ""first pipe"", sales people invariably refer you to what are known as ""aromatic"" tobacco blends. Here is where you must step up as a cigarette smoker, or you will never smoke your pipe. Aromatics tend to taste very weak. While they smell nice to non-smokers, you will get no appreciable nicotine from them if you already smoke. You should instead purchase an English-style blend or one of the Scandinavian tobaccos. Try Dunhill 965, Amphora, or Plumcake. Something with some kick. If your store mixes their own, even better, but you must insist on something strong. ""English"" is the key word. Avoid anything all-black because it will often be too sweet. Look for black and gold

, You'll use pipe cleaners every time you smoke, because otherwise tar accumulates in the stem of the pipe and tastes terrible. You may also even use one half-way through a smoke to rid the stem of any gurgling water that condenses in it. The pipe nail is useful for tamping, but mostly useful for scooping unsmoked tobacco and ashes out of the pipe.

, With the pipe over the tin (or some clean surface), pick up a big pinch full of tobacco. This stuff is cheap, we're not trying to save it. So pick up a pinch big enough to fill the entire bowl. Put that in the bowl and poke it down to about 1/3 the original size. Then do that again, poking harder this time. Then once more. The idea is to have a lightly packed bottom layer, a medium middle layer, and a tight top layer. Each time, fill the bowl to the top. By 3 packs, you will have a bowl 3/4 full after packing, and that's perfect.

, You can get one of those fancy pipe lighters but your trusty Bic will do fine. Don't use a Zippo, it will taste like fuel. To light, hold lighter sideways over the bowl, flick. Puff with your MOUTH ONLY. Do not inhale! Puff Puff puff, waste the smoke. The first smoke will taste nowhere near as good as the later smoke so just get her lit.

, In fast, puff very slowly. Don't inhale, just hold smoke in your mouth and blow it out. Think 1-1000, 2-1000 for each puff. Otherwise you will burn your tongue and not taste anything for a week. Puff until the pipe is warm.

, You will need to puff every 10 or 20 seconds or so, to consistently keep the pipe lit. If it goes out, don't worry, you can light it up again. In fact, it's one of the great features of pipes, the ability to relight without it tasting horrible.

, Up to you. If you sit and smoke an entire pipe, you will get a great nicotine buzz just like you would from a few cigarettes. But you'll possibly live longer and most likely your non-smoking friends will think it's cooler. Also, you may find it much more relaxing than the quick and dirty drug-taking that cigarettes have become. Pipes can taste as good as fine cigars and be as cheap and convenient as cigarettes, if used properly.

Look for correct crater size.,
Add the draw tube.,
Attach the screen maintenance pin.,
CHOOMette option: as with Socket-wrench one-hitter, above, drill an end-to-end tunnel through a 4-inch (10-cm)-long wood piece with one (top) end the right width so that the screened hose nipple fits tightly in it, and the other (butt) end the right width so that at least a half-inch of the flexible drawtube fits tightly in it.",How to Make Smoke Pipes From Everyday Objects2," The best cylindrical crater diameters readily available include 7/32 inch (5.5-mm), 6-mm and 1/4 inch (6.3 mm) inner-diameter of nipple.

If the nipple you have found is wider than that, insert a snug-fitting metal (usually brass) tube-segment to narrow it down.
If your nipple is narrower than the above diameters, use a variable-speed drill at slow speed to drill it open to the correct width and depth of crater as shown in the diagram above.

, Attach a flexible long draw tube that fits snugly over the barbed tail end of the hose nipple. You can stretch the outermost half inch of the hose with needle-nose pliers, making it easier to slip the hose over the end of the barbed brass stem., To the barbed shank of hose nipple, tightly wind a 5-inch wire braid and attach a safety pin.,"

Breathe in.",How to Make a Waterfall Bong2," Remember that you are putting it into the socket that you placed inside the cap. Screw the entire cap on once it is filled with your smokable product.


Ground smoking material will work better, as it will restrict incoming airflow less than solid matter will.
Take the pieces of herb and rip it up into small pieces, about the size of bead or a very small pebble. Place the pieces of herb into the bowl – remember your bowl is the head of the socket.

, Make sure you are in a place where it is okay for the water to spill out, like over a sink or a pool or outside. Part of the process is having the water empty out of the bottle while the smoke replaces it. Now let go of the carb and as the water is pouring out of the carb, light the bowl.While the water level is lowering the bong will pull in the smoke from the bowl.

, Screw off the bowl and start sucking in. As you suck in let go of the carb. This change in pressure in the bottle will help funnel the smoke into your lungs. Be prepared for a large hit.


Try to breathe the air in deeply. Breathing in air will bring the smoke into your lungs. Repeat the process as many times as you want.
Change the bottle about once a week. It gets dirty after frequent use.

Obtain a bottle.Some people like to use a two-liter bottle, but a standard 16.9 ounce water bottle can also work just fine.,
Take apart a plastic pen.You will need the pen shaft to work as a smoke shaft.,
Cut a hole in the side of the bottle.Using scissors or another tool, gently poke a small hole (just large enough to insert the pen shaft) in the side of the bottle, approximately 1/3 the distance from the bottom.,
Insert the pen shaft into the hole.Test the size of the hole by inserting the pen in the hole at a downward angle.,
Pierce a carb into the bottle.,
Attach a bowl.,
Fill the bong with water.,
Pack the bowl.Simply place some of your favorite herb in the metal socket bowl.,
Position the bong.,
Light the bowl.,
Smoke.",How to Make a Water Bottle Bong2,"


Remove the lid from the bottle and discard it.

, Any plastic pen that can be taken apart to leave a hollow cylinder will work.

, Your pen shaft will extend at an angle into the water.

, If the hole is too big, it will be hard to get a tight seal.


If it turns out that your hole is too big, you can still salvage the bong. Just place pieces of tape where the pen shaft meets the bottle to make a tighter seal.

, On the opposite side of the bottle, make another small hole (about the size of a pencil eraser).This will be used as the carb when you are smoking.

, Affix a metal socket to the outside end of the pen shaft. Use another few layers of duct tape to make a seal. The socket is your bowl.


You can use any sort of metal socket that is the right size. Look around your house for a suitable object. If you can’t find anything, visit a hardware store, where you’ll find lots of possibilities.

, Pour water from the top of the bottle into the bottom of the bong. Fill it approximately 1/5 full.

, Don’t overdo it; you can always add more later, but you don’t want it spilling over the sides.

, Place your mouth at the top of the bottle, where the lid was. Tip the bong so that the bowl is facing away from your body.

, Using a lighter, ignite your herb and begin to suck in slowly to force the smoke through the water. Make sure to place a finger over the carb hole while doing this.

, Set the lighter down when the bottle is filled with smoke. Remove your finger from the carb hole. Suck the smoke in deeply through the top of the bottle.

Get an apple and a pen.,
Remove the stem from the apple.,
Bore a hole through the top of the apple.,
Bore a second hole near the bottom of the apple.,
Bore a third hole on the side of the apple.,
Make a bowl.,
Use the pipe.",How to Make an Apple Pipe1," This pipe is considered ""pure"" because all you need to make it is an apple and stick-like device, such as a pen, with a tip sharp enough to poke a hole in the apple.


Make sure the apple you use is fresh. A soft apple could collapse while you're trying to bore the holes.
It's ideal to use the type of ball-point pen with a tip you can unscrew so you can take out the ink well. Otherwise, you may spill ink all over the apple. Once you take out the ink well, screw the tip back on.
Don't use a pencil. It's likely to break inside the apple while you're trying to make a hole with it.;
, You can use your fingers to twist or pull it off or cut a slit around the stem to remove it. Make sure you get the entire stem; if it breaks, dig into the hole with your fingers and remove it from the base.

, Place the pointed tip over the hole where the stem used to be and jam the pen into the apple at a slight angle. Push it into the apple until you've made a hole that extends about halfway through the apple.


If the apple is difficult to push through, it may help to use a twisting motion as you push.
Once you make the initial hole with the pen's tip, you can remove the pen, unscrew the tip, and use the tip-less pen to push into the apple. The apple will slide into the hollow pen. When you're finished making the hole, remove the pen and discard the apple piece.

, It should be about half an inch from the hole at the apple's base. Insert the pen and poke a hole that meets up with the first hole you poked.

, Insert the pen into the apple an inch or a little more from the top hole. Push the pen into the apple until the third hole meets up with the chamber system you have created. This hole will serve as the carb, so it should be in a place that is convenient to cover with a finger while you're lighting the pipe.

, Use the pen or another object to carve out a hollow shape on the top of the apple where the first hole was drilled. Make it big enough to hold the material you want to smoke.

, Fill the bowl with the material you want to smoke. Hold the apple in one hand with your finger covering the carb, the small hole on the side of the apple. Use your other hand to light the bowl, and suck in with your mouth through the hole near the bottom of the apple.

Recalibrate the hygrometer.",How to Season a Humidor," Humidors are typically made of wood, and because the wood is porous, it will allow moisture to escape. Seasoning the humidor increases the moisture content of the wood, helping it maintain the humidity inside better. To season your humidor, you'll need:Clean dry towel
Distilled water
Propylene glycol
Small bowl
Cigar humidifier
Clean sponge
Plate
Hygrometer;
, Wipe down the inside and outside of the humidor with a clean, dry towel. This will remove dust, splinters, or anything else that may have accumulated on the wood.Do not use a damp towel or sponge to clean the humidor, as this can cause the wood to warp and swell.

, Mix half a cup (119 ml) each of propylene glycol and distilled water in a small bowl. This will be used to charge the humidifier, which is a device that will maintain the humidity in your humidor after you season it.Only ever use distilled water for your humidor, because it’s free of impurities.
Propylene glycol is a synthetic liquid that will coat the wood, help control the humidity, and prevent mold and bacterial growth.

, Place the humidifier into the bowl with the humidifying solution. Let it soak in the solution for about 15 minutes, until it’s completely saturated.Remove the humidifier from the solution and place it face down on a clean towel. Let it dry on the towel for 30 minutes. This will allow excess water to drain out, and protect the humidor from water damage.

, Remove any shelves and drawers from the humidor. Place the humidifier into the empty humidor, as well as the hygrometer. Then, dampen a clean sponge with distilled water, and wring it out to remove the excess. You want the sponge damp, but not dripping wet.Place the sponge on a plate and place it inside the humidor. If you don’t have a sponge, you can also use a shallow dish filled with an inch (2.5 cm) of distilled water.
A hygrometer is an instrument that measures moisture content, or humidity.

, Replace all the drawers, trays, and shelves inside the humidor. Close the lid and set the humidor aside for three days. Avoid opening the lid during this time, as this will allow moisture to escape, and will slow the seasoning process.


Seasoning generally takes between three and five days., After three days of seasoning, open the lid on the humidor and check the hygrometer to see what the humidity inside is at. The humidity may be anywhere between 60 and 85 percent, but you can only proceed if it’s at 72 percent or higher.If the humidity is below 72 percent, add more water to the sponge, close the lid and leave it for another day. Check again in 24-hour intervals until the humidity reaches 72 percent or higher.

, Once the humidity inside the humidor reaches at least 72 percent, remove the sponge and plate, and close the lid again. Let the humidor rest for another two days, giving the humidity level time to stabilize.After two days, start checking the humidity level every 24 hours. You want the humidity to stabilize at 70 percent.
Once the humidity reaches 70 percent, leave the humidor for another one to two days. Continue checking daily that the humidity stays at that level.
Do not otherwise open the lid during this time, as it will affect the humidity level inside.

, Once the humidity in the humidor stabilizes at 70 percent, you can add your tobacco products for storage. Over the next few days, the tobacco will absorb some of the moisture, and the humidity may drop. That’s fine, as long as the humidity stays between 65 and 70 percent, which is the ideal range for a humidor.If there is too little moisture in the humidor, the tobacco will dry out. Too much humidity, however, and the tobacco could go moldy.
Always keep an eye on the humidity level in your humidor to ensure it stays within the safe range.

, Once your humidor is seasoned, you will still have to maintain the humidity in order to preserve your tobacco products. Anytime the humidity level dips to 65 percent or lower, recharge the humidifier.To recharge the humidifier, soak it in a half-and-half distilled water and propylene glycol solution for 15 minutes.
When the humidifier is saturated with the solution, set it on a towel to dry for 30 minutes.
When the excess moisture has dripped out, return the humidifier to the humidor.

, The seal on the humidor is integral to maintaining the humidity inside. If the seal isn't tight enough, moisture will escape, and you'll always be battling a dry humidor. If there's a problem with the seal, you may need to exchange or replace the humidor.


To test the seal on the humidor, place a piece of paper halfway inside the humidor. Close the lid so the paper is trapped between the lid and the humidor. To test the seal, gently pull on the piece of paper. If it comes out easily, there's a problem with the seal. If there's resistance and the paper doesn’t easily move, the seal is fine.Repeat with all sides of the humidor to test the seal all around.

, Part of keeping your humidor at the right humidity level is storing it properly, and that means keeping it in the right place and at the right temperature. The ideal location for your humidor is a cool spot that’s out of direct sunlight.


The right temperature for a humidor is between 60 and 75 F (15.5 and 24 C).

, When the humidity inside the humidor becomes to high, you can easily lower it by opening the lid. Leave the humidor open for 30 minutes.


In 24 hours, check the humidity level again. If it’s still high, leave the lid open for another 30-minute interval. Repeat daily until the humidity stabilizes., An inaccurate hygrometer can often be blamed for the humidity reading in a humidor. Often, you may find that the humidity level is fine, and it’s the hygrometer that’s off. This is especially true with analog hygrometers, which tend to be more inaccurate than digital ones.If you're having trouble keeping your humidor at the right level, try recalibrating the hygrometer.

, A kitchen skewer works well for this purpose as it is long and thin with a sharp point., Poke a small hole through the bowl to connect to the channel in the side.

, Make sure that air can flow between the depression carved for the bowl and the hole. Remove any chunks of fruit that appear when you blow through the hole.

, Poke small holes in the foil using a safety pin. Lining the bowl will help keep your smoking material dry from the moisture in the fruit while the holes will allow smoke to pass through.

, Fill the foil lined depression with the substance you are smoking.Light the material with a lighter while you inhale through the hole poked in the side.

Familiarize yourself with the varieties of cigars.,
Choose a mild cigar (or a few).,
Inspect the cigar.,
Store the cigar appropriately.",How to Smoke a Cigar1," Instead of choosing the first cigar you'll see, you should know how to recognize each different type of cigar, and even ask a salesman for help when you're deciding on a type of cigar. Being aware of the different types of cigars will make you feel more knowledgeable when you actually start smoking them. There is a variety of cigars to choose from.


The Corona. This cigar measures 6 inches (15.2 cm) by 42-ring gauge -- this refers to the diameter of the cigar. This cigar has an open foot (the part that is lit) and a closed and rounded head (the part that you smoke).
The Pyramid. This cigar has a pointed, closed head.
The Torpedo. This cigar has a bulge in the middle and a pointed head and closed foot.
The Perfecto. This is like the Torpedo, except it has a bulge in the middle and two closed ends, making it a rounder cigar.
The Panatela. This cigar measures 7 inches (17.8 cm) by 38-ring gauge and is longer and thinner than the Corona.
The Culebra. This cigar is made of three Panatellas braided together. It looks like a thick rope.;
, To get started, you'll need to start sampling a few different kinds of cigars. Don't get too eager and buy an entire box of the same kind of cigar only to find that you can't stand the first one. Instead, find several varieties of cigars that may suit your needs. You should start with a mild cigar, which will not only be less expensive, but will have less of an intense flavor and will be better for beginners.









The longer and wider a cigar is, the more intense it will be. If you're a beginner, you should start with a longer and thinner cigar instead of a small stubby one, which will make you more likely to cough.

, Before you buy the cigar, you should gently squeeze it to make sure that there aren't any spots that are too hard or too soft. This may indicate that the cigar will give you a bad draw or that it won't even be smokable. You should also look out for lumps in the cigar, and make sure that the tobacco at the end isn't discolored, and that the wrapper isn't discolored either.








, If you own or have purchased a humidor, a box for storing cigars, then make sure to store them in the box immediately. If you don't own one, then don't buy more than a few cigars because they will dry out in a couple of days. Do not take them out of their cellophane packing either. Don't leave a cigar unprotected. Store them in Tupperware or another sealed container.

Get an apple, a knife, a spoon and a pencil.,
Cut off the top of the apple.,
Carve the chamber.,
Make the carb and mouthpiece.,
Use the pipe.",How to Make an Apple Pipe2," For this method you will need a few extra supplies, but the pipe is easy to make and the result looks more neat.

, Place the knife about half an inch below the stem and slice off the top of the apple. Take the stem out of the apple's top.


Don't cut off the top too close to the stem. The top of the apple will be made into the bowl, and you want it to be sturdy.
You may have to wiggle the stem out to dislodge it. Try not to damage the top of the apple.

, Use a spoon to carve a circular chamber out of the base of the apple. Run the spoon through the flesh around the edge of the apple, so that you create a circle about 1⁄3 inch (0.8 cm) from the edge of the apple. Dig the spoon into the apple to remove the flesh from inside the circle and down to about 1⁄3 inch (0.8 cm) from the base of the apple.


Don't get too close to the sides or the bottom of the apple when you're working with the spoon. The pipe won't be sturdy unless the apple has enough flesh left to hold its structure.
Use a knife to help you break up the flesh in the middle of the circle if it's difficult to remove it with the spoon. Score it a few times with the knife, then dig around the scores with the spoon.

, Hold the base of the apple in your hand. Use the pencil to carefully poke a hold about an inch below the rim of the apple. This will be the carb. Poke a second hole a few inches to the side of the carb to make a mouthpiece.

, Place the lid back on the apple. Fill the hole at the top of the lid (where the stem was) with the material you want to smoke. Hold the apple in your hand and cover the carb with your finger while you place your mouth over the mouthpiece. Use your second hand to light the pipe while you inhale.

Poke small holes.,
Poke a large hole on the side.,
Remove the tab off the can.








,
Condition the pipe by heating the smoking area and the adjacent area of the can.,
Smoke.,
Understand the health risks.",How to Make a Pipe from a Soda Can1," A typical 12 oz soda can works fine, as well as a larger ""tallboy"" style can. Make sure all the soda or beer is out of the can and rinse it out with clean water. Let it dry before continuing with the process.






;
, The next step is to make holes in the center of the can's side. A pencil or pen is also an effective hole-poker.









If nothing is available, consider breaking the can's tab in half and using the sharp point to create a series of small holes.

, Since you'll want to place your smokables on the other side of the hole you'll smoke out of, make it the opposite side of the mouth of the can. Use your thumb to press in a shallow rut.








, Use the needle, pin or other piercing implement to poke a pattern of holes over the basin formed by the indention. They don't need to be big, but the more of them you make, the better. Create a grate-like pattern.








, Pick location which feels most natural to cover with a finger or thumb as you smoke, then use a sharpened pencil or a pen to pierce the can.








,, This will vaporize chemicals used to coat the interior of the can before you light up. You can also sand the paint off the indention and the adjacent area. This removes a large part of the potentially harmful material that might be vaporized as you smoke. You can use the end of the hole-poker you used, or some sandpaper is some is available.








, To smoke, place your tobacco or other smoking material on the indentation, hold you mouth to the drinking hole in the can, and cover the cab with your thumb. Inhale to fill the can with smoke and release the carb when you're ready to inhale.








, Heating and inhaling aluminum has been linked to Alzheimer's and other neurological diseases. While it's true that it's difficult to heat the aluminum to a high enough vaporization point using a simple Bic lighter, it's also inefficient and probably best to not mess with.









The basic principle of the soda-can pipe can also be transferred to widely available things like apples, potatoes, and other things that don't have the harmful potential for side-effects. Smoke at your own risk.

Fold the paper in half lengthwise.,
Add smoking material to the paper.,
Roll the paper between your thumbs and index finger.,
Lick the end of the paper gently to seal the cigarette.,
Light one end while inhaling from the other end.",How to Make a Smoking Device out of Anything2," A book with pages like a bible is a good choice for this purpose. A book printed on rice paper is the best option., The ink may add unwanted chemicals to your smoking experience.

, Cut a small rectangle approximately 2 inches long by 1 ½ inches wide.

, Make a crease in the center of the paper to hold your smoking material in the center of a “V” shape., Place a small amount of crumpled smoking material in the V of the fold.

, Create a rolled cigarette by pinching the paper in the middle and roll it between your fingers.Roll the material towards one end of the paper and wrap the paper around the smoking material.

, Use your saliva as a glue to stick the paper to itself.Seal the ends of the cigarette by twisting the paper gently to keep the smoking material from falling out.

, Breathe in slowly as you light the end to get the paper and smoking material to begin to burn.

Find a pen with metal tip.,
Disassemble the pen.,
Place the metal tip in the pen backwards.,
Fill the metal pen tip with smoking material.,
Light the smoking material and inhale.",How to Make a Smoking Device out of Anything3," Pens that are made completely from plastic will melt if you attempt to smoke, so the metal tip is important to prevent the plastic from melting in the heat., Take the pen completely apart to obtain the metal tip and hollow shaft of the pen.


Unscrew the tip from the pen.
Remove the writing tip, ink chamber, and spring mechanism.
Remove the back end of the pen.

, Insert the narrow end of the metal tip into the hollow shaft of the pen. Push it in as far as possible to create a seal between the pen and the metal tip. You can use a lighter to melt the plastic slightly to force the tip to bind to the end of the pen.

, Place a small amount of smoking material in the pen tip carefully to avoid breaking the seal between the pen and the tip.

, Breathe in through the end of the pen while you light the smoking material contained in the metal tip.

Find an empty water bottle and a pitcher.,
Cut the bottom of the bottle off.,
Form a bowl with aluminum foil.,
Fill the pitcher with water.,
Pack the bowl.,
Light the bowl and fill the chamber.,
Inhale the smoke.",How to Make a Smoking Device out of Anything4," The water bottle becomes a chamber for the smoke while a pitcher filled with water provides suction to draw the smoke in.

, Use scissors to remove the bottom of the water bottle. The bottle should be able to sit flat, so make sure you cut in a straight line., Use a small square of aluminum foil to create a bowl on the top of the water bottle. Gently push the aluminum foil down into the drinking hole of the bottle, and then wrap the extra foil around the sides of the lid. Use the tip of a thumbtack or an earring to poke small holes into the bottom of the aluminum foil bowl.Make sure the foil does not wrap too far around the inside of the lid because you’ll need to be able to lift it off to smoke.

, Put enough water in the pitcher to cover 2/3 of the height of the water bottle. When placed in the pitcher, the top of the bottle should extend about 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) above the water level in the pitcher.


With the foil on top of the bottle, slowly lower the open bottom of the water bottle into the pitcher.

, Place your smoking material in the foil bowl on top of the bottle.


If you lower the bowl and bottle into the water filled pitcher after filling the bowl, you risk the air pressure created blowing your smoking material out of the bowl.

, Use a lighter to light the smoking material and start it burning. As it burns, slowly lift the bottle in the water. As you pull it up, the negative air pressure will pull smoke into the bottle. Stop before the bottom of the bottle comes completely out of the water and carefully remove the foil bowl.

, Put your mouth on the top of the bottle to breathe in the smoke. Slowly push the bottle back down in the water to force the smoke into your mouth.


The slower you pull up, the more the bottle will fill with smoke.
Don’t let the bottle come completely out of the water or the smoke will dissipate in the room and you won’t be able to smoke it.
When the bottle reaches the bottom, inhale to clear all the smoke. As you inhale, the water will rise up into the bottle. Stop inhaling before the water gets to the top of the bottle so you don’t end up inhaling the water.

Place the blade down on the cigar.,
Cut the cigar with one ""chop.""",How to Smoke a Cigar2," To cut the cigar, you'll have to cut into the cap, which is placed on the head of the cigar to keep it from drying out. Ideally, you'll be using a guillotine (a single-bladed cutter), but you can also use a really sharp knife or blade. Don't use dull scissors, your teeth, or a butter knife unless you want to tear the cigar. Just tap the head (or the cap) of the cigar with the blade to put it in position. Don't cut into it yet.








Aim the blade to the place where the cigar meets the wrapper, which would keep the cap from falling off.

, The goal in cutting it is to let yourself smoke the cigar without ruining its original shape. Hold the cigar with one hand and the guillotine with the other. Place the head of the cigar into the guillotine and cut into its cap, about 1/16 to 1/8 of an inch (.15 to .3 cm) down. Slice off the cap (or head) in one quick chop.









If you do it more slowly or tentatively, you'll be more likely to tear the wrapper.

Choose the right lighter.,
Warm the tobacco in the foot of the cigar.,
Light the cigar.,
Lightly blow on the foot of the cigar (optional).",How to Smoke a Cigar3," Long wood matches or a butane lighter are preferable because they won't alter the flavor of the cigar. Don't use paper matches, gas lighters, or -- worst of all -- scented candles. You can also get a cigar lighter at the store.







, The foot of the cigar is the part you'll actually light. Hold the flame below the foot without touching it, and rotate the cigar a few times until the foot is evenly warmed. This will warm up your tobacco and make it easier to light.








, Hold the flame in front of the cigar without touching it. Then, inhale just enough so that the cigar is lit. Make sure not to inhale the smoke.








, You can do this to make sure that the light is evenly distributed. To check if the cigar is fully lit, turn the lit end towards your mouth and gently blow on it; the lit portions will light up orange.








"
"
Smoke it.,
Puff and rotate the cigar every 30 seconds to a minute.,
Remove the band after twelve puffs or so.,
Enjoy your cigar with an alcoholic beverage.,
Extinguish the cigar when you're done smoking.",How to Smoke a Cigar4," Hold the cigar up to your mouth and draw in the smoke. Then, hold it in your mouth for a few seconds to taste it, and then let it go. Do not inhale the cigar smoke. A cigar is not like a cigarette. The flavor is meant to be savored, but not inhaled.








, Continue to do this to keep the cigar in good form. Remember that a good cigar can last 2 to 3 hours.








, The band is placed on the cigar to prevent the tobacco from tearing, but you won't need it anymore once you lit the cigar. After twelve or so puffs, the band will already be starting to fall off on its own due to the heat.








, Though you're not required to enjoy your cigar with an alcoholic beverage, an alcoholic beverage can enhance the smoking experience and can bring out the flavors of the cigar. Some great beverages for smoking a cigar include port, cognac, bourbon or scotch, or red wine -- especially Cabernet Sauvignon.








A coffee-based beverage -- or even coffee -- can also bring out the flavor in a cigar.
Though a cigar can overpower the flavor of many beers, an India Pale Ale (IPA) beer is a perfect companion to almost any cigar.
Any drink that involves Kahlua will be a great companion to a cigar.
You can also enjoy your cigar with a Martini.

, Simply set it aside in the ashtray. The cigar will extinguish itself after a minute or two without you puffing on it. Before you set it down, gently blow through the cigar to expel any smoke that will go stale. Relighting a cigar after this period has passed generally results in a strong, bitter taste; as a result, most aficionados prefer to throw out a smoked cigar.

Smoke.",How to Make a Pipe from a Soda Can2," If you want to make a water-pipe or bong-style pipe to smoke out of, you'll need:









Two 12 oz cans
Tape
Can opener
Scissors
A trumpet mouthpiece or glass slide

, After rinsing and drying two 12 ounce (340 g) cans, you'll want to use the can opener to remove both ends of one can and the top end of the other can. Use the can opener as you normally would to open a can of soup. Now, you should have one cylinder with both ends removed and one with no top which will act as the base.







, Cover it with tape to make sure you can't get cut on the edge. You will place your mouth on this end.








, On the side of the can, poke a hole large enough to fit the stem of the mouthpiece or whatever you plan on lighting your smokables in.









Try to make sure you round out of the edges of the hole. You can cover it with plenty of layers of tape.

, Connect it with tape. Spend some time building up the tape layers so it'll fit snugly.








, Tape both cans together to create the full chamber of the water pipe.








,, To smoke, fill the mouthpiece with whatever you're planning on smoking and inhale through the top of the top can. When the chamber fills with smoke, remove the mouthpiece when you want to inhale.

Obtain a cheap click pen with a removable cartridge and a metal tip.,
Remove the back piece of the pen (the clicky part) and remove the cartridge.,
Press the point of the pen tip into the tube so that you have an open, conical ""bowl"" on top of the pen.,
Place a cigarette filter at the other end of the tube to prevent inhaling ash (optional).,
Fill the tip with tobacco and light it, then inhale from the other end of the pipe.,
Make new pen pipes when you feel like smoking, instead of using the old ones.",How to Make a Pipe Out of a Pen," The metal tip is crucial; this is where you will be burning your pipe tobacco. If the tip is plastic, you will ingest toxic fumes from the burning of plastic. The pen must be easily dismantled as well.


The tip of the pen is the small metal cone that surrounds the point when you're writing.
Never light or smoke out of plastic -- it can release toxins that you do not want to inhale.;
, Completely dismantle the pen, throwing out the bottom end, the ink cartridge, and any springs or levers. You should left with an empty pen tube and the metal pen tip.

, This is where you will put your smoking supplies. For the best results, tilt it slightly so that it rests diagonally in the tube, but is still flush. If you're having some trouble making it fit, you can try...Notching the top of the tube, like a set of cross-hairs, so that it spreads when you push the tip in.Use a small amount of glue to create a seal between the pen tip and tube.

, There is a good chance you'll accidentally pull some of the smoking material through as it heats up, getting unpleasantly in your mouth. You can remove the filter from a cigarette and jam it in the pen tube to prevent this, or roll up a small strip of index paper into a spiral and use this to create a little screen at the end of the pen.

, You'll likely need to hold the pen slightly above your head, lighting it and inhaling with the filled-up pen tip on top. This is why, when possible, slightly angling the bowl will make it easier to smoke, as you don't have to bring the pen quite as high.More often than not, you need to make sure the bowl doesn't slip out. You can either hold it, or glue it temporarily in place.

, Pens aren't made to be heated up and inhaled. While you'll be fine using the pen once or twice, repeated usage can cause the pen to leech chemicals, which you end up smoking after too much use. Avoid the issue entirely and make a new pen pipe when needed.


The pen pipe is generally a last-resort for smoking. Whenever possible, use actual equipment made to be smoked out of."

Remove the packaging.Cheyenne cigars come in packs similar to typical cigarettes.,
Light the cigar.Hold the cigar in one hand between your fingers and place the end of the cigar over a flame.,
Suck on the end of the cigar.,
Savour the taste and body of the smoke.Unlike cigarettes, you should take your time to appreciate the flavour of a cigarette.,
Try exhaling through your nose.Exhaling the smoke through your nose will give you the opportunity to experience the scent directly.,
Take drags periodically.Upon lighting the cigar, take drags from it regularly to make sure the cigar keeps burning.,
Roll ash into the ashtray.Unlike a cigarette, don't tap the butt of the cigar into an ashtray.,
Cut off the filter for a fuller body.Although you may want to hold off on this unless you're an experienced cigar smoker, cutting off the filter at the end of a Cheyenne cigar will allow the tastes and material to enter your mouth more directly.",How to Smoke a Cheyenne Cigar1," Remove the cellophane wrapper encasing the pack and open up the lid. Dispose of the cellophane in the garbage once you've removed it completely.


You should be able to smell the cigars upon removing the cellophane.;
, In terms of lighters, a torch lighter is your best option, because it will allow the cigar tip to burn thoroughly.


Placing the cigar directly in the flame will hurt the cigar's flavour.

, While the cigar is lit, inhale on the reverse tip of your chosen cigar. Inhale slowly until smoke begins to billow from the lit tip. Inhale the smoke into your mouth, but don't let it get in your lungs, or you'll cough violently.

, After taking a puff from the cigar, let the flavour linger and enjoy it. When it subsides, take another puff.


Because Cheyenne cigars are small, you won't get the same body from it as you would with a typical cigar.

, Cigars are often packed with strong smells, and exhaling through your nose will open up the sensory experience.

, When white smoke begins to bellow from the tip, it will burn on its own and you shouldn't feel rushed to finish it.


If the cigar loses its fire, you can always relight it.

, Instead, roll the cigar end around the floor of the ashtray until the tip breaks off. You shouldn't be worried about constantly breaking off the cigar, as a long ash is a sign of a good cigar. However, you should dispose of it before it gets long to the point of snapping.

, Although this is certainly less healthy, it does have the effect of making the body (or ""smoke feel"") of your cigar a lot bolder.

Moisten your tobacco leaves.,
Select your wrappers.,
Cut the central vein out of the wrapper leaves.This vein is identified by tracing the stem up through the leaf to its tip.,
Select your binder.,
Select your filler.,
Form your filler leaves into a bunch.,

Roll the binder leaf.,
Select your head and foot.,
Seal the binder leaf.,
Place the wrapper face down on the table.,
Roll the wrapper.,
Apply a cap.,
Apply the finishing touches.",How to Roll a Cigar," Before they can be rolled, your leaves must be moistened or ""cased."" You can use a fine mist of water or a humidifier to moisten the leaves. Placing the leaves in a large plastic bag with a bit of water will also do the trick.


The amount of water you need, and the length of time your leaves should be moistened, depends on the type of leaf you are working with. Very dry leaves will need to be exposed to more moisture than less dry leaves. Experiment with different volumes of water and periods of absorption to find out how you can get the most pliable leaf.;
, Wrappers are thinner, larger, and more malleable than the other leaves used in the cigar. They will be used to hold the other leaves together and form the outer ""skin"" of the cigar.

, By cutting the leaf vertically along each side of this central vein, you will ensure the wrapper will be as smooth as possible.


If you wish, you can make your wrapper even smoother by pressing it briefly with a warm iron or a rolling pin. The most intact and aesthetically pleasing leaves should be used as wrappers.

, The binder will hold the filler leaves before being covered by the wrapper. Midgrade leaves -- those which are intact enough to contain filler leaves but not acceptable as wrappers -- make good binders.


Like the wrapper, the binder will need to be deveined. Cut the leaf along either side of the stem so that you end up with two roughly symmetrical halves.

, Fillers are placed in the innermost core of the cigar, and are surrounded by the binder leaf. You can shred your filler into smaller, finer pieces if you wish.


Choose the most aesthetically problematic leaves for filler. Leaves with holes or uneven coloring are the best options for filler leaves.
Keep your filler leaves a bit drier than the binder or wrapper leaves, but ensure they remain flexible.
Since filler comprises the bulk of the cigar, flavor is an important factor when choosing filler leaves as well. Sample different varieties of tobacco to find one you like.

, Grab a handful of rolled leaves with the ends sticking out of your clenched hand. The length of your bunch -- and the length of the whole cigar -- is a matter of personal preference. Most range from 5 to 7 inches long.


Put the thickest leaves in the center of the bunch, and wrap each leaf in progressively thinner leaves. This layering effect prevents tunneling (inability of the wrapper leaf to burn) when it is eventually smoked.How many filler leaves should you use? This is, again, largely a matter of preference. However, keep in mind that too many leaves will prohibit proper air flow; too few leaves will make the cigar burn too quickly and too hot., The binder should be face down, with the veins of the leaf visible. Angle the binder at about 45° to either side, but make sure to lay one end of the filler bunch on the starting end of the binder leaf, with the rest of the filler directed out towards the side where the upper edge of the binder leaf leads.


For instance, if the binder is on the table and angled diagonally toward the upper right, place the filler bunch on the binder in an elongated horizontal (left-to-right) position with the left end of the bunch against the leftmost end of the binder.
Don’t squeeze the bunch too tightly when placing it on the binder leaf.
If you’re using shredded filler, lay the binder leaf flat on the table, veined side up, and line your binder up as if it composed a single bunch.

, To roll the cigar, fold the pointed end of the binder leaf slowly over the filler leaves. Tuck the folded-over edge beneath the filler, just as you might when making a sushi roll. Give the binder a small pull towards you to compress the filler leaves a bit, but don’t pack the filler too hard into the binder. With your fingertips on the semi-rolled binder leaf, continue to roll it by moving your fingertips up and over the cylinder, directly away from your body. Move from one end to the other, starting at the pointed end and rolling towards the wider, rounder end.


Roll the cigar across the table a few more times to work it into a more perfect cylinder. Use the same technique you did the first time, taking your fingertips up and over the cylinder and stopping when you’ve rolled it into your palm.
You may need to cut excess leaf if the cylinder you made is longer than you’d like. You can use a sharp kitchen knife, or a ‘’chaveta’’, the traditional cigar-cutting tool used by professional rollers.

, One end of the cigar must be the head (the end of the cigar you inhale from) and the other the foot (the end of the cigar you light). Twist the head to a rough point by turning the cigar lightly in one hand while gently pinching the head between your thumb, middle, and pointer finger. Give it a few rotations, just enough to ensure it holds its shape.


You will refine it later, so don’t bother trying to make it look like a perfect cigar you’d pull from a box.

, Apply a small amount of egg white, cigar glue, Tragacanth, or guar gum to the bottom edge of the inside of the leaf (the side facing up) to keep it from unrolling.


If you have access to a cigar press or mold, place the cigar in it when ready. Cigar presses help make the cigar more symmetrical and give them a finished look. Cigars at this stage are pressed for 30-45 minutes.After the designated time period has elapsed, the cigars are removed and rotated 90° before being reinserted into the press for another pressing equal in time to the first. It is important to turn the cigar to ensure that you don’t end up with a seam jutting out of one side or the other.

, The face of the wrapper leaf is the smoother of the two sides. The other, veined side should face inward when the cigar is rolled., The rolling process is not much different than the rolling of the binder leaf, but should be done with greater care. With the wrapper leaf angled diagonally relative to you, fold the pointed end of the wrapper leaf slowly over the cylinder (composed of filler cased in binder). Tuck the folded edge beneath the binder and begin to roll. Place your fingertips on the semi-rolled cigar, and continue to roll it by moving it out and away from you slowly. Move from one end to the other, starting at the pointed end and rolling towards the wider, rounder end.


Apply a light layer of cigar glue over the inside of the wrapper leaf as you roll it.
Use your non-rolling hand to pull the wrapper taut as you apply it to the binder to ensure the finished product has a smooth outer surface.
A good roller will roll the leaf tip towards the foot or tuck end (where the cigar is lit). Doing so will ensure the cigar gains a more robust flavor as it is smoked.

, The cap is formed from leftover scraps of the wrapper leaf and affixed to the head of the cigar (where you inhale). Like the binder, the cap should be sealed with Tragacanth, cigar glue, or guar gum.


Cut a “D” shaped piece out of the wrapper leaf. The long edge of the D should be about one quarter the length of the cigar.
Apply some cigar glue to the veined side of the cap.
Grip the cigar in a vertical position with one hand and apply one corner of the cap at an oblique angle from the cigar. At this point, if you laid the cigar down in line with your body, with one end of it close to you and the other end further away from you, one corner of the D-shaped cap would be affixed to the cigar near the far end, and the other corner of the D-shaped cap would lie beyond the end of the cigar and slightly to one side or the other.
Roll the cap around the cigar. The curvature of the D should allow you to end up with an open hole at the end of the cigar whose edge is relatively flat.
Use some cigar glue to close the end of the cap. Gently pinch it closed and twist it slightly in your hand to ensure the cap comes to fine point.

, The only really crucial step left at this point is to dry the cigar on a drying rack for 24-48 hours. The wrapper will then tighten around the cigar as it dries. But there are several things you can do to make your cigar look and feel like a more complete product.


Place the cigar in a tuck cutter to trim excess leaf. A tuck cutter is a device designed to precisely cut the end of the cigar that you light (the tuck end or foot). This will give the cigar its proper length. Alternately, you can simply take a sharp knife to the end and gently cut through it.
Drop the cigar in the cigar press for a final pressing. You could press the cigar for up to 12 hours depending on how attractive you want to make the finished product.Turn the cigar 90° after the designated time period has elapsed and press it again on that side for an equal amount of time.If you don’t want to bother with a cap, simply pinch the head again when you’ve completed rolling it, sealing it with a bit of cigar glue, guar gum, or similar agent. Turn the cigar on its long axis as you pinch it between your thumb, pointer, and middle finger to ensure it doesn’t unroll.

Unscrew the cap and smoke.",How to Make a Gravity Bong in 10 Minutes," Start by unscrewing the cap from a 2-liter or comparable plastic bottle such as a Gatorade bottle, milk bottle, or fruit juice bottle,. For this, you’ll need a hole punching tool, a drill, a knife, or scissors. Twist the implement until you screw a hole through the center of the cap.





;
, Continue to cut away the inside of the plastic cap until the hole widens. Pinky-sized is an average size to shoot for. Larger holes will give you quicker draws but use up your smokeable faster.









If you’re going to use a bowl piece, widen the hole until the bowl piece fits.

, Rip off a piece that’s big enough to contain the cap. Include extra length so you have enough foil to use. Place the cap aside for a moment.










Instead of foil, use a socket for a socket wrench, a thimble, or another circular piece of metal that you can use to hold your smoking substance.
The danger from using foil is a common myth, but the foil does not release enough aluminum during smoking to cause harm to you., Use your finger as a guide. Hold your finger in the center of the foil, then carefully wrap the foil upwards and around your finger. The bowl will have the shape of your finger and fit inside the cap.







, Pick up the cap and keep it top side up as you push the foil into cap’s hole.. Turn the stuck up ends of the foil down and smooth them against the plastic cap.









, Set the cap down and get a hole punching tool. A mechanical pencil or toothpick work well if you don’t have a tool from a hardware store. Poke a couple of holes on the part of the foil over the hole in the cap, about four to six to let enough smoke through. Scatter them about so the foil doesn’t break. If the holes are too big, your substance of choice will fall through.










While sockets and other metal can also use foil, you can line the inside of the socket with metal mesh to create a bowl.

, Find the Gatorade or 2-liter bottle. Measure a quarter to halfway up the bottle. Using a knife or scissors, make a cut where you measured. Cut all the way around the bottle. This bottle will hold the smoke.







, A water or milk jug wider than the bottle you already cut works for this purpose. Measure down a quarter or halfway from the top, then cut the bottle the same way as you did the other one.








Instead of a bottle, you can simply use a large container such as a bucket, coffee pot, pitcher, or stopped sink, You won’t have to cut these.

, Set the container down and fill it up with tap water. Limit the amount of water so that the container is only half-full. This amount will give you enough gravity to make the bong work without making a mess.









, Place your favorite legal smoking material on the foil inside the indentation you made earlier. Do this before you assemble the rest of the bong or else the pressure will make the smokeable fly out.










When picking up the cap, make sure your substance of choice isn’t falling through the holes in the foil.

, Pick up the top part of the Gatorade or 2-liter bottle you cut earlier and move it into the water. If your water container is big, you may need to hold onto it. Retrieve the cap with the bowl and screw it onto the bottle.









, Hold the bottle down as you ready your lighter. Light up your bowl. As you light it, slowly pull the bottle upwards with your other hand. You should notice milky smoke filling the bottle. Make sure you don’t pull the bottle out of the water.







, Once smoke has filled the bottle, it is ready for use. Unscrew the cap. To smoke, place your lips around the bottle and push down. The smoke will easily shoot out.

Acquire a plastic bottle.,
Make a hole in the bottle.,
Make a hole in the bottle cap.,
Make the bowl.,
Cover the hole at the bottom with your thumb.",How to Make a Gravity Bong1," A 2-liter soft drink bottle is ideal. Pour everybody with you a tall glass of tasty soda—they'll thank you later when they have cottonmouth, and you need the bottle empty.









Coke's new redesign of their bottles makes some lids harder to work with. If you do use a Coke product, try to find a different lid.;
, You can use a drill, or simply hold your lighter to the plastic (on the side, near the bottom). When the plastic becomes soft, poke your scissors through to make a hole. Rotate the scissors 360 degrees to make the hole wider.









Make the hole just large enough so that you can still cover it with your thumb. If it’s too small you won’t get sufficient enough airflow to pull a hit; if the hole is too big, or even almost too big, to be easily covered by your index finger, get a new bottle.

Alternatively, you can use a glass bottle. This will require you to use a drill with a glass-friendly drill bit, but the idea is the same.



, Use the lighter to soften up the plastic if you need to. When you have poked all the way through, rotate the scissors to make the hole rounder.









A small switchblade-sized knife is best because, generally, when you stab it through the top until it hits the desk, the slit it makes is the perfect diameter of the hole you want. Once you’ve stabbed through the top of the cap, slowly and deliberately twist the knife so that it carves out a perfect circle. However, scissors or your drill will also do the trick.

, There are a couple ways you can do this: with aluminum foil or an aluminum can.










Aluminum foil method: Tear of a small square of aluminum foil and lay it flat across the top of the bottle cap.

Push it down in the middle with your finger so that it forms an indentation in the hole that you just made.
Scrunch the aluminum foil around the edges of the bottle cap so that it stays on tightly.
Finally, use a pin or needle to poke small holes in the part of the foil that goes into the hole. Make them small enough so that anything you put in the bowl will not fall through.



Aluminum can method: Carefully cut a rectangular piece out of an aluminum soda can. It's probably best if the soda can is empty before you do this.

Bend this rectangle into a funnel shape. You want the top of the funnel to be large enough to put tobacco in, and the bottom to be small enough that nothing can fall through.
Slide the funnel into the hole in the bottle cap. The bottle cap should more or less bisect the funnel, so that the top of the bowl sticks out but the bottom will go down into the bottle when you but the cap back on.
Use hot glue or superglue to glue the funnel to the bottle cap and make sure that the hole is sealed airtight.



, Making sure you have a good seal, fill the bottle with water.









Fill up the bowl with tobacco and screw the bottle cap back on.
Light the tobacco in the bowl and release your thumb from the hole at the bottom. As the water drains, the vacuum will suck the air through the tobacco, into the bottle, and the bottle will fill with smoke.
When the water has completely drained, unscrew the cap and inhale.
If you have a funnel and a container to catch the water, you can keep recycling the water over and over again. (You can make a funnel out of a soda can the same way as described above, only larger.) This makes this method very portable and usable pretty much anywhere that you would normally smoke.

Fill the fruit bowl with tobacco.",How to Make a Hookah," Put just enough water into the base so that the stem is submerged about 1-1/2"" (38 mm) into the bowl.


You need to leave just enough room in the vase so that your smoke doesn't bubble up into the hose.
Avoid putting milk or dairy into your base. Adding dairy will ensure an unpleasant smell, mold, foaming in the vase and ruined hoses.;
, The grommet is a seal that joins the stem to the vase. Most hookahs come with a rubber or plastic seal. Silicone is the best material for a seal, but you an also simply seal the vase to the stem with electrical tape.

, You need to put it on before you put the bowl on because the bowl may not fit over the tray.

, If your hookah has 2 ports, then you can purchase a rubber seal to close off the other port.

, Follow all of these steps for the best smoking experience:


Evenly mix your tobacco so that all of it is covered in flavoring and molasses.
Fluff up your tobacco and drop it loosely into the bowl. Leave 2 millimeters of distance between the top of the tobacco and the bowl so that the shisha doesn't touch the foil when you put it on. Burned shisha will add a nasty flavor to your smoke.
Buy a good quality shisha. The quality of your shisha will determine the flavor of your smoke. You can also mix and match flavors for a great-tasting smoke. Buy 50-gram portions of shisha so that you can try it out without spending a lot of money.
You can cut up your tobacco leaves with kitchen shears to more easily pack them into the bowl. However, don't cut them too small or they'll fall through the holes and clog your bowl.

, Your foil piece should be 2"" (5 cm) larger on all sides so that you can form a tight seal around the bowl.


Keep the foil tight so that wrinkles don't distort the heat distribution. If you only have thin foil on hand, then double it up.
When you're finished, your foil-covered bowl should resemble the head of a drum.

, Take care not to shred your foil. You can try a couple of different patterns based on the kind of bowl that you have:



Egyptian bowl: Start with a circle of holes around the perimeter and spiral inward.

Funnel-style bowl: Make 3 concentric rings: 1 around the edge, 1 around the spire and 1 between the 2 circles that you've already made.

, Hold the coals with a pair of tongs and light 1 corner with a match or lighter. Because sparks will be produced, you should either go outside or stand near a window.


Always use the tongs that come with most hookahs to light or move your coals. Avoid using kitchen tongs, which may have been coated in a polymer to provide a non-stick coating for food prep and easy cleaning.
When the coal starts to sparkle and emit smoke, pull the flame away. The coal should continue sparking until all of it turns bright orange.
If the coal still has some blackened patches that aren't burning, then blow on the coal to encourage it to heat up.

, The sides that were covered by your tongs should be unlit. Blow on these parts to cause them to burn orange. Let the coal sit on the foil until each one has a coating of ash over it.


Never light the coal directly on top of the foil. The particles released from the coal will get into the bowl and change the flavor of your tobacco.
If you're in a place with no stove, lighter or matches, then you can use instant-light coal.
Natural coals burn much longer than quick lights but require something much hotter than a lighter to ignite them. Most people use either a single coil stove burner or a butane torch to light their naturals.

, Avoid washing the hose unless you know that it is washable.

, Allow the bowl to heat up naturally. Don't take hard pulls to accelerate the heating process because you'll just end up burning the tobacco. Take your time while you smoke. A good hookah can last between 45 minutes and 1 hour.

, Apples, mangoes or oranges make good choices, but you can use any large round fruit that you have on hand.

, Leave about 3/4 of the fruit intact. Dig out the flesh, leaving a 1/2"" (13 mm) of flesh attached to the sides.

, You can use a corkscrew, potato peeler or another sharp object. The hole should be the size of your index finger.

, Leave about 2 millimeters of empty space at the top.

, Poke small holes throughout the foil that are evenly spaced.

, Light the coals and smoke the hookah. Because of the coolness of the fruit, you may have to use a few more coals than usual to get your smoke going., Dig out the flesh, leaving a 1/2"" (13 mm) thick layer on all sides.

, Use a potato peeler, a corkscrew or a paring knife.

, Screw the apple onto the top of the hose, and seal the connection with some plasticine.

, You can use a burning cigarette or other concentrated heat source to make the hole.

, The connection should be tight. If you see a gap between the plastic and the straw, then seal the gap with more plasticine.

, Cover it with foil, poke holes in the foil, light your coals and place the coals on the foil. Enjoy your homemade hookah.

Cheyenne cigars are generally considered to be budget cigars, so you may not choose to treat them as you would a ""real"" cigar.

, If you haven't already, throw the pack in the garbage when you've exhausted all of the cigars. You should avoid littering your packs on the ground whenever possible.

, Children and youth are not allowed to smoke cigars or cigarettes. For the sake of responsibility, keep your cigars somewhere where they're not at risk of being picked up and used by children.

, Because a cigar is a fairly nuanced experience, it's good form to take a couple of minutes after smoking to reflect on the tastes and scent of the cigar. What was the flavour, smell and body of the cigar? Most importantly, did you like it? Reflecting on the cigar is made more enjoyable if you've sampled a variety of cigar flavours. That way, you can compare and contrast them and pick which of them was your favourite.

, With that in mind, it's not surprising that there's a dedicated community behind the appreciation of cigars. Talk about your Cheyenne cigar experience with friends and other cigar aficionados. From there, they may be able to give you recommendations on different types of cigar to choose.

, You will want one large enough to fully submerge your container. Full gallon jugs work well for this, too.









Fill it with water. Place the container into the water with the cap removed. The top of the container should rest an inch or two above the surface of the water.
Load the bucket with your desired smoking substance and screw on your lid. Be sure to put the container into the water first, before screwing on your lid, or it'll blow your herb right out of the bowl.

, As you are lighting, slowly draw the bottle out of the water. The chamber will fill with smoke.









Once the container is nearly full and before the bottom comes out of the water, prepare yourself: breathe out!

, Twist off the cap and place your mouth on top of the container and, without inhaling, push the bottle down til it reaches the bottom of the bucket. This will force the smoke into your mouth without you even inhaling. When the bottle reaches the bottom, inhale the rest and take your mouth off just before the water rises all the way to the top close to your mouth.









If you inhale while pushing the bottle down, you might not be able to clear the whole thing.

;
, Fold the square of foil in half, being careful to keep the foil free of wrinkles and tears.








, You will have a square, roughly 6"" wide, that is 4 layers thick. The thickness will help keep the pipe from overheating and also make it strong enough so that it isn't crumpled the first time it's used.








, Roll the square into a tube that is slightly flared at one end (like a very narrow cone). The narrow end will be the end you will smoke from. If you want to, use a pencil or barrel of a pen to roll the foil around at the point. This will keep the tube open and give you a nice round opening to smoke out of.








, Measure 1"" down from the wider end of the tube. This is the ""bowl"" end of the pipe.








, Using a credit card, make a sharp crease at the 1"" mark and bend the end up to form the bowl. Be careful not to crumple the tube when you do this. Keeping the pencil in the tube can help.








, Insert smoking material of your choice into bowl. You may or may not way to add an aluminum filter before adding in the material.









You can make a quick filter to hold the material in place by taking a very small square, poking hold in it with a needle, and then covering the entrance to the stem of the pipe with it.

, Apply fire to it and suck out of the other end. Use it just like you'd use any other pipe but remember not to reuse it.

Bottles with a long neck and a wide base work best. Getting a clean, perfectly sized hole for the stem is easiest with a bottle that has little curve on the upper slope where the base connects into the stem., You'll need a 3/4"" diamond drill bit to drill through the glass. Despite having the word ""diamond"" in the name, these usually only run for about eight to twelve dollars. You might have to order the bit online so make sure you don't leave this step for last., You'll want a 14mm glass bowl and downstem. Choosing the proper length for your downstem is important. Measure the distance from the upper curve of the body of your bottle to the opposite side of the base. Aquire a downstem approximately the same length, and definitely no longer.Glass downstems and bowls can be found at local head shops or ordered online.
You'll need a rubber grommet with the following measurements: an outside diameter of 31/32"", an inner diameter of 1/2"", and a 3/4"" groove. These can be found at supply stores like Home Depot, or can be found online.

, Empty the bottle and wash it out with warm water. Warm water helps the drilling go smoothly. You're going to be drilling in the sink, so make sure that area is clear.

, Remove any plastic that might be on the bottle. Find a spot on the bottle where the surface is relatively flat, somewhere on the upper curve of the body. Place the gasket there and use it to trace a circle with a sharpie., Attach the diamond drill bit to your drill. Be sure to use a battery powered drill, as you will be running water over the drilling area. Since there will be drilling and glass involved, it's a good idea to put on safety googles., To keep the glass cool and prevent it from breaking, turn on the faucet. You want more than just a trickle but not such a heavy stream that you can't see what you're doing. Hold the bottle so the water runs over the spot you marked., Set your drill to 3/4 of its max speed and gently push it against the marked spot. To get a steady drill, first angle the drill bit so it just touches the top of the spot. Slowly angle the drill bit until it's going into the glass at a 90 degree angle, using the carved out edge as a pivot. Once you're nearly through the glass, ease up on the pressure a bit to avoid cracking or breaking the bottle., Use the drill to smooth the edges of the hole. Pour out the water and rinse the bottle several times to clean out the bits of glass. The last thing you want is to inhale glass powder, so don't rush this step., Take your 3/4"" grommet and work it into the hole. Then run some water over your downstem and slide it into the grommet, carefully, so you don't push the grommet into the bottle.Insert the bowl into the stem, and you've finished!

For the purposes of making a bong, a bottle with a wide, contoured based and a narrow neck will work best. Make sure the bottle is empty and clean before you begin drilling.Tequila and specialty liquor bottles tend to have shapes that make them ideal for converting them into bongs.
Look for especially unique bottles to use if you think you might put your bong on display, or if you plan to make a bong for someone as a gift.;
, Pick up a set of glass drill bits from your local hardware store. These can also be found at most superstores like Walmart and Target. A small set of 3 or 4 bits will do just fine; you're just looking to work up to a 1/2"" bit to drill the right size hole for the bowl stem later on.Drill bits come in sets that include as few as 3 bits or as many as 15. A smaller set will of course be cheaper and should be all you'll need for this project, provided that the set includes a 1/2"" bit, as this will accommodate most bong stems.

, Take a small strip of duct tape and stick it where you plan to drill the hole for your stem (somewhere in the upper third of the bottle near the middle of the base will probably work best). The tape will provide traction to hold your bit in place as you drill.


Masking tape or painter's tape may also fulfill this function.

, Drilling slowly, start with the smallest bit and work your way up to a 1/2"" bit for the optimum hole size for the stem. Starting with a smaller bit and moving up gradually will prevent the glass from cracking or breaking from the force of the drill.Applying too much pressure while drilling can shatter the bottle. Go slow, and make sure you're drilling smoothly and evenly.
Electric drills are dangerous tools. Care should be taken when drilling to avoid injury.

, Purchase a glass stem or set of stems to fit the hole you drilled. Check to see if you have a tobacco or ""head"" shop in your area, as stems are typically sold there, or buy one online and have it delivered. A bong stem sometimes includes a bowl; if not, you'll need to snag one of these too. As the hole you drilled was 1/2"" in diameter, you should look for a stem with roughly the same width, and it should be long enough to reach to the midpoint of the bottle so that the bottom of the stem is partially submerged once you fill the bottle with water.Bong stems come in various diameters and lengths. You may have to do some checking to find the right fit for the bottle you're using. If you're unsure about the size, it might be smart to buy a couple different stems and see what works best.
An average glass bong stem runs between $5 and $10, depending on where you look.
If you do have to buy the bowl and stem separately, make sure the bowl is the appropriate size for the stem (the measurements should be displayed prominently on the package) and attach the two by sliding the bowl onto the thicker end of the stem.

, Double-check that the hole is the proper size to accommodate the stem before you remove the tape. If the hole is too small, you can move up one bit size and carefully re-drill to touch it up. The stem should insert all the way into the hole up to the bottom of the bowl.


If the hole you've drilled is too large, you can constrict it a little when you seal it by fitting it with a rubber ring, or by using a slightly wider stem.

, Use a coat of clear silicone to seal the area around the drilled hole. Sealing the hole will cover its rough edges and improve the bong's suction. Alternatively, a rubber ring can be purchased at any smoke shop to allow removal of the steam to facilitate cleaning.Silicone sealant is flexible, non-toxic and forms a tight seal. A 2-ounce tube of liquid silicone sealant can be purchased for under $10 most places and is easy to apply., Give the silicone time to set up before filling or using the bong. Liquid silicone sealant usually takes between 4-6 hours to dry completely. Once the silicone dries, the hole will be water-tight when the stem is inserted to prevent spillage and keep smoke from escaping through the edges of the hole.

, It's likely that glass dust or other residue might have gotten into the bottle during the drilling process. Rinse the new bong out thoroughly, including around the sealed drill hole, to make it safe to use.


Glass dust is especially hazardous to breathe or ingest, and it only takes a few moments to clean your new bong. Don't skip this step., If you want, you can now add some pizzazz to your bong. Apply stickers or decals, etch your name into the glass or draw on the bottle with paint pens. Personalizing your homemade bong will make it stand out even more, which is a great touch if you choose to display it or give it as a gift.

, Fill your new bong up with water past the bottom of the stem. Drawing in the smoke through the water turns the smoke you inhale to a smooth vapor and allows for a less harsh smoking experience. Place your favorite smoking product in the bowl and you're ready to go!"

",How to Make a Bong,"






;
, This hole is where the smoke will enter the bong from your bowl and stem. (The tighter the hole is around the stem, the less tape or sealant you will need. This takes finesse!)








, This could be a metal pipe, a hollowed out pen tube, or a stem bought at a store or online. Make sure it's at a positive angle, or else your herbs will get wet.








, If it's not completely airtight than your smoke will go out of the holes where it's not supposed to! To fix this use either gum (works best) or tape. To test that it's airtight, put your hand really close to the seal, and blow through the mouthpiece. If you feel air coming out, it's not airtight. You can use a rubber grommet to make it more airtight (see Tips)








, If you can, pick up an inexpensive glass bowl from your local smoke shop, they will usually run about 5 dollars. You can also roll a cigarette with rolling papers and attach it to the end of the tube. Aluminum foil can be used but it is not recommended. Please check to make sure your bowl material is safe for inhalation before using.








, You can fill it with more, but there will be less smoke in the chamber when you smoke. Make sure you don't put too much water, if you do it will drown your herb!








, The hole shown in this picture is in a ridiculously high place and would not allow the smoke to mix with the air being let in. This will allow oxygen into the chamber.

Take your time.",How to Light a Pipe," Use a wooden match or pipe lighter. Pipe lighters are made specifically for tobacco pipes, and should not alter the taste of the tobacco. If using a match, strike it and let it burn for a few seconds to get the sulfur off.


Be wary of lighters that are not specifically designed for tobacco pipes. Some pipe enthusiasts claim that the butane from the lighter subtly impacts the flavor of the tobacco itself.
Strike a wooden match against the emery strip along the package. Allow the sulfur to burn off the tip before applying it to the pipe. A wooden match will not impart a taste of lighter fluid.;
, Char the top of the tobacco, but do not light it completely yet. Hold the flame just above the tobacco at a skimming distance. Draw your breath in using a half a dozen steady puffs. Move the flame in a circle to reach all of the tobacco.This ""charring light"" aims to burn the tobacco slightly, but not to light it completely.
Don’t breathe the smoke into your lungs. Puff steadily and slowly to avoid a sharp “tongue bite.” Pipe tobacco is generally stronger and more flavorful than the tobacco used in cigarettes., Once the pipe is evenly lit, this is the “true light.” You are now ready to settle into the smoking session. Keep puffing periodically to make sure that the pipe stays lit. The bowl should stay lit for at least 5-15 minutes once it is properly burning.


Keep air flowing through the tobacco. If you don't want to inhale so often, try exhaling gently into the pipe. The air should stoke the pipe fire from within and send a thin wisp of smoke trailing up out of the bowl., You may need to relight your pipe several times over the course of the smoking session. Use the same steady, circular motion with your match.Tamp the tobacco down lightly to remove the charred top when the light goes out. The removal of ash from tamping will allow the pipe to burn more evenly.

, If it is dirty, then run a pipe cleaner through the stem. Then, turn the pipe over and dump out the debris, or “dottle,” into an ashtray. Finally, blow through the pipe to clear it out completely.

, Spread it on a layer of clean paper. Break up clumps and check that it isn’t moist.If it is moist, leave it spread across the paper to dry out for 10 minutes to an hour.

, Dangle loose strands of tobacco into the bowl of your pipe. Continue to do so, bit by bit, until it reaches the top of the bowl.

, Buy a tamper from a tobacconist or an online retailer. Press gently when you tamp the tobacco.


Avoid touching the tobacco with your hands. The finger oils and force can clump the tobacco together.

, If your pipe has straight sides, it should now fill half the bowl. If it has graduated sides, it should be two-thirds full.

, Draw your breath in. If it is difficult to draw air through, the bowl is packed too tight. The tobacco should be soft and springy, rather than clumpy, when it is packed.

, Tamp down the tobacco slightly more than you did the first time. Still use gentle pressure.

, You may need to draw more breath than last time. However, air should still come through the pipe. If air doesn’t come through, then the bowl is packed too tight. Start over.

, Tamp down gently. Your bowl should be full and ready to light.

, If you're just getting started, consider buying a cheap corncob pipe. Blown glass pipes are common for smoking marijuana and other non-tobacco plants.

, Just like cigarettes, pipe tobacco can pollute indoor air and spread harmful secondhand smoke. Light the pipe at least 30 feet (9m) from the entrance of a public space. If you can .


If it is a windy day, then pack your pipe inside and bring it outdoors to smoke.

, Enjoy the smoke. Set aside 20 minutes to smoke your first pipe full of tobacco."

Check the tips and warnings at the bottom of the page so you don't accidentally break your pipe.,
Look inside your pipe to see where the resin has collected.,
Clean it.,
Place your pipe into a Ziplock and fill it with isopropyl alcohol; not all the way to the top but just enough to cover the bowl.,
Let it sit for at least 3 hours.,
Go to the sink and run warm to hot water.,
Continue to rinse your pipe until you cannot smell any isopropyl (it is flammable).",How to Get Resin out of a Bowl1,";
, Untwist a paperclip or take the rubber ends off a bobby pin. Poke it into the mouthpiece, carburetor, or bowl (anywhere you need to) and collect the resin as best you can. Optionally, you can stick a lighter (10-15 seconds) where you plan to scrape. This heats the resin and makes it stickier. It is better to not try the lighter method or scraping the outside the bowl, as the resin here is going to be very hard. Instead, run the bowl under hot water for about 30 seconds, then take your fingernail (protected by a strong cloth or napkin if you don't want dirty nails) and scrape for a huge amount of resin. After scraping, you will get several very sticky black chunks of resin. Find somewhere to lay them where they can easily be picked up. Metal or a similar surface works best because it's impossible to separate moist resin from things like Kleenex and pipe cleaners after if it's been meshed into the material by accident. Once you have all your resin pieces removed and they have become cool/somewhat dry for better conformity, roll them together into a ball. If you aren't going to smoke the resin then skip this step entirely.


Continue to scrape until you can see through the glass or look inside and see no pieces of resin left.

, For your pipe to look like new you will need at least 90-95% isopropyl alcohol, preferably 100% (it takes a lot to break resin down). You can find it at your local drugstore or Walmart. You may also want to buy a canister of uniodized salt.

, Using salt as an agitator (shaking the bag side to side for the agitation) will drastically reduce the time cleaning takes.

, If you used salt with the alcohol, it doesn't have to sit at all, just shake until finished. No one wants to wait 3 hours before using their favorite piece.

, Rinse your pipe well. If you skipped the salt or scraping step, scrub it with a baby bottle brush or test tube cleaner to remove any remaining debris. Water and a tiny squirt of dish detergent alone will remove any alcohol.

, Once you have rinsed it and the smell has gone, your pipe should look new and ready to be re-resed

Tap socket wrench piece carefully down into the mouth of the chillum so that the fat part fits tightly, about flush with the top of the chillum, and the narrow part, containing the screened crater, juts out about a centimeter (7/16 inch).,
Two methods of adding a long drawtube are shown in the diagram: a.,
Semi-vaporizer technique: the object is to insert 25-mg. (1/40 gram) of pre-sifted herb or shredded tobacco product, etc., into the crater-- rather than light up a whole 700-mg conventional cigarette, which instead breaks down into 28 separate pinch-servings, usable any time and place.,
Don't be in too great a hurry to get it started burning; desired ingredient (the nicotine, cannabinol, thymol or whatever) will vaporize out at temperatures just under 400 F.; once any part of the herb is dry enough to start burning, its function is to heat neighboring particles of the herb from which the ingredient is still vaporizing.,

Smell the cigar beforehand, too; if its smell is appealing, you will probably enjoy smoking it. Additionally, choose a cigar without gaps or tears in its wrapper, and avoid cigars that are mottled, spotted, or flakey.Cigars can be up to an inch thick; if you're a new smoker, consider choosing a smaller one.
A cigar should never crumble in your hands.
If you're cigar shopping online, always read others' reviews to make sure the cigar is good quality.;
, This includes wooden matches, torch lighters, or butane lighters; petrol lighters and candles should not be used because the odors from them will overwhelm the taste of the cigar., If you are using a match, let the head of the match completely burn out before toasting the cigar, or you may inhale a sulfur taste. When you are sure the match or lighter is lit, hold the cigar in your hand. You can hold the cigar with your thumb and pointer finger.


When using matches, wait a brief moment after lighting the match for the initial flame to reduce to a more manageable size.
If you are using matches, you may need more than one to light the cigar.
Do not hold the flame too close to your face.

, Hold the cigar at a 45 degree angle very close to but not directly into the flame. This will prepare it for lighting. Gently rotate the cigar as you toast it.


Toasting the foot of the cigar dries out the tobacco leaves to prepare them to light.
Toast the cigar until the tip is smoldering.
Sometimes, people just toast the cigar until it lights.

, After toasting the cigar for a few moments, it will begin to smoke. It isn't lit yet, but it is ready to be lit. At this time, you can place the cigar in between your lips.

, This draws the flame into the cigar and lights the end. Just as before, do not hold the cigar into the flame, but just above it. Never inhale cigar smoke as if you are smoking a cigarette; this can cause an unpleasant feeling and can make you nauseous.


You can blow gently across the lit end of the cigar to see how evenly it has been lit.
When it is evenly lit, the entire end will glow.
You want to only put the very end of your cigar in your mouth to avoid getting too much saliva on the end.
Continue to puff the cigar and rotate it until the tip is glowing.

, This uneven burning needs to be fixed. The first way you can fix a run is to rotate the cigar so the area that isn't burning as quickly is at the bottom of the cigar.


Because a fire needs oxygen to burn, the bottom of the cigar burns faster.
The slower-burning part should soon even out with the rest of the cigar.
Try another method if the burn continues to be uneven.

, If rotating the fast-burning end doesn't help even the burn, apply moisture to the wrapper where you want the burn to slow down. Touch a little bit of saliva to your finger and then to the wrapper.


Do not drench the cigar in saliva; this will ruin it.
Do not touch the tip of the cigar since it is very hot. Only touch the wrapper.

, This is a drastic measure, as it will make you lose part of the cigar, but it will even out the burn. Use your match or lighter to roast the end of the cigar until the uneven section falls off. Then, the end of the cigar will be even, and it should burn more evenly.


Use an ashtray to catch the uneven section.
Be careful; the glowing tip is hot and could fall on you.

, Do not inhale any smoke, but rather, hold the smoke in your mouth for a few second before blowing it out. You also do not need to puff on the cigar constantly; taking a puff twice every minute will keep it lit., Cigars do not need to be ashed until they build up a bit of ash on the end. If you ash the cigar too often, it will get put out. When ash does build up, lightly tap the cigar into an ash tray, allowing the ash to fall.

, Cigars will often go out, especially near the last third.When this happens, light the cigar again by holding it close to a lit match or lighter. Puff on the cigar and rotate it until the entire end is once again glowing.

, Cigars do not need to be stubbed out like cigarettes.

Hang the hose somewhere with a towel underneath it to catch the water that will drip out of it as it dries.
Don’t use the hose again until it has finished drying completely.

,


Fold the hose over so both ends are in on hand.
Using moderate force, thwack the hose into a soft but sturdy object to jar loose the particulate matter within.
A sofa is a good object to thwack it against. Don’t choose any surfaces that might damage the hose, like a sidewalk or a brick wall.
Blow through each end of the hose as hard as you can to expel the particulate matter.
Hook the hose up to a vacuum cleaner or air compressor (like a bicycle pump) if you have trouble summoning the required lung strength.

, The top part of the hookah relies on the broad base at the bottom to stand up straight, so take all of the pieces apart to keep the hookah from toppling over. Make sure you keep all small pieces in a secure location so you don’t lose anything.


Unscrew and remove the release valve.
Remove the grommet from the hose port.
Remove the bowl from the top of the hookah.
Remove the bowl grommet that was underneath it.
Lift off the tray that catches coal ash, making sure to dispose of any ash in it without making a mess.
Twist and jostle the stem of the hookah gently until it comes loose from the base, and set it aside.

, Dig your fingers into the clean side of the foil to help jar the caked tobacco loose without getting your fingers dirty.


Run warm faucet water over the bowl.






Use your fingers to scrape off any caked-on tobacco that’s left behind.
Bring a pot of water to a simmer.
Carefully submerge the bowl in the water. Use the charcoal tongs that came with your hookah to get the bowl into the right position without burning your hand in the hot water.
Leave the bowl in the simmering water for 3-5 minutes, then remove it using the tongs.
Protecting your hand with a thick towel, scrub the bowl using steel wool to remove old, black burn marks.

, The grommets are the protective disks that keep different parts of the hookah from rubbing up against and damaging each other. They don’t affect taste very much, but it’s good to clean them anyway. Simply run them under warm water, using your finger to smooth over the surface and remove any matter that might have accumulated there. Set them aside on a towel to dry.

, Again, simply run warm water over it, rubbing the surface with your fingers. Set aside on the same towel to dry.

, If you haven’t been keeping up with your regular hookah maintenance, you may well have a charred mess in your ashtray. If you only had loose ash, simply rinse the tray in warm water and rub over the surface with your fingers.


If there are black, caked spots of ash on your tray, use hot water to rinse the tray. Scrub it with steel wool to dislodge the ash.
Continue rinsing until the tray is clean and the water that comes off of it runs clear.
Set it aside on the towel to dry.

, Because the stem is very long, you may be unable to find an angle that will allow you to run water directly from your faucet into the opening at the top of the stem. If that’s the case, pour water into the stem from a glass or pitcher. Make sure the stem is over the sink, so the water can drain away. Do this for about thirty seconds.

, You may have received one with your hookah when you originally purchased it; if not, you can buy one anywhere hookahs are sold, or online.


With the stem brush inserted, pour water down into the stem.






Pull the brush in and out of the stem vigorously, about 10-15 times.
Flip the stem over and repeat the process from the other side.

, Pour about two tablespoons of lemon juice (fresh or bottled) into the open end of the stem. Reinsert the stem brush and scrub again, scouring the inside of the stem with lemon juice.


Remember to switch sides, plugging the other hole and scrubbing with the brush from the other side.

, Pour a quarter to a half teaspoon of baking soda into the stem. Scrub again with the brush, remembering to insert the brush from both ends of the stem.

, Standing the stem up in the sink, pour water into it with a glass or pitcher, rinsing the lemon juice and baking soda away. Run the water in from both ends of the stem — at least thirty seconds each.

, Both are located on the sides of the stem. You should be able to angle the stem in the sink to get them under the faucet. But again, use a glass or pitcher if your sink’s dimensions don’t allow for it. Rinse for at least thirty seconds.


Insert your finger into the hose port to clear away any debris that may have accumulated.

, Leave it on the same towel where the rest of your smaller hookah parts are. Keeping everything in one place cuts down on the odds of losing something.


Lean it up against a wall if possible, so gravity can force the water to drip down out of it.

, If your hookah still has stale old water in it from the last time you used it, carefully pour it out into the sink, making sure not to spill up over the sides and make a mess.

, Make sure your base is at room temperature before adding hot water to it; if you recently use ice with your hookah, adding hot water immediately might cause the base to crack.


Use your fingers to rub inside the top of the base, as far as your fingers can comfortably fit.
Pour the water back out.

, Measure out about two tablespoons of lemon juice and one teaspoon of baking soda, then pour them into the base of the hookah. Swirl the base around to mix them together; it’s normal for the solution to fizz up a little when the two products come into contact.

, A base brush is shorter than a stem brush, and the stiff bristles are much wider. Again, you may have received one with your initial purchase of the hookah; if not, they can be found anywhere hookahs are sold or online.


With the lemon and baking soda mix still in the base, insert the base brush.
Twist it around inside the hookah, making sure to press it up against the sides firmly to scrub well.

, Once hot water has been added to the lemon juice and baking soda mixture, cover the open end of the base with the palm of your hand and swirl the contents around, making sure to cover all of the internal surface of the base.

, Fill the base up all the way to the brim with hot water, then set it aside somewhere where it won’t be knocked over to rest. Let it sit for at least one hour; leave it overnight if you want to do a deep clean.

, Once you’ve let the water, lemon juice, and baking soda mixture do its work for at least an hour, rinse the base clean with hot water. Turn it upside down over a towel to let it dry.

Find a suitably humid environment to store the cigars.,
Leave the cigars inside the box with the lid open.,
Allow cigars to sit for up to a month.,
Rotate the cigars every 2-3 days.",How to Rehydrate Cigars1," Store the cigars somewhere with abundant natural moisture in the atmosphere. Damp or humid places like cellars and greenhouses make ideal environments for exposing dried out cigars to constant, steady levels of humidity.Be sure that the place you choose is room temperature, or only slightly warmer or cooler. Never leave cigars in places that receive direct sunlight or are near any kind of heat source.;
, Crack open or remove the lid of the cigar box and make sure the cigars are evenly distributed inside. Leaving the top of the box open will allow moisture to more easily infiltrate the box and penetrate through to the tobacco inside the cigars.


If the cigars aren’t completely dried out, leaving the lid propped open will be sufficient for allowing moisture to enter the box. For thoroughly desiccated cigars, leave the lid off.
A warm, damp towel can be folded and placed beneath the stored cigar box to provide an extra boost of moisture for especially dry cigars. Just be careful to change the towel out frequently, or it might mildew., Leave the cigars in the humid location for a couple weeks to a month. Make sure the cigars are situated where they won’t be knocked over, become wet or be exposed to direct heat or cold. This is the simplest method of rehydrating dry cigars, but also the slowest, as rehydration will occur at a very gradual rate.


Though it takes time, slow rehydration works best, as moisture is returned to the cigars little by little, which keeps the cigars from becoming overhydrated.Overhydration is essentially irreversible, and can result in deadening the cigar’s flavor, making it difficult to keep lit and even causing mold to grow on the tobacco.

, Check back on the progress of the cigars regularly. Rotate each cigar a quarter turn inside the box every few days; this will ensure that the entire outer edge of each cigar receives the same amount of moisture so that they hydrate evenly."
"
When selecting a cigar, note the ""feel"" of it in your fingertips.,
Start by clipping the cigar about 1/2"" from the tip.,
Lighting a cigar is almost an art in itself.,
Once the tip is glowing red, wait 45 seconds, at least.,
Lightly puff the cigar, letting the smoke you draw through the stick escape from your mouth.,
Puff the cigar once or twice every 60 seconds or so.,
That said, now it is time for you to understand that you should be taking notes about this cigar.,
Burn: Is the cigar burning regularly?,
Don't rely on any cigar to taste wonderful past the halfway point of the stick.,
Give each category a rating: 1-5 stars, say.,
Combine the ratings and give the cigar a final ""score.""",How to Rate a Cigar," Is it spongy? Dry? Marred? Or does it feel weighty, with uniform firmness from tip to tip, a beautiful, unmarred leaf with no visible veins, and a moistness that you would expect from a cigar in Nicaragua--at 70 degrees and 70% humidity? That is the cigar that is ready to be smoked.;
, This will provide the ideal draw. A punch will give you a hole through which to draw the smoke, but it will likely be concentrated and hot. Better to clip the stogie for an open draw.

, It may seem cumbersome, but the benefits are well worth it. Once the cigar is clipped, ideally use a strip of Spanish cedar (which comes with many cigars), light the strip and ""toast"" the end of the cigar. As the flame chars the tobacco, it will begin to give off smoke. Pull the flame away, and blow on the the charred end--you're trying to ignite the tobacco. Do this again and again (never touching the flame to the cigar) until the tip is glowing red.

, Let the cigar reach smokeability. Be patient.

, You will already begin to taste the deliciousness of the blend of tobaccos, the leaf, the binder, the wrapper that the Master worked so hard to achieve.

, Here is what you're looking for:


Clouds of creamy smoke: the sign of a wonderful cigar.
Let the smoke linger in your mouth before blowing it out. Let it bathe your tongue and taste buds. What do you taste? Oak? Hickory? Fruit, like strawberries or mango? Maybe toast, or even buttered toast? Coffee accents, or a ""chocolatiness""? All common in the best cigars. Let your mind wander: What do YOU taste in the smoke?
As you draw the smoke through the cigar, also breathe in gently through your nose. You'll get a hint of the smoke coming from the burning tip of the cigar, mingling with the smoke you take into your mouth. This is key: What new flavors and aromas do you sense? Roasted meat, or maybe burning leaves? Every nuance of aroma and flavor is something the Master who designed this cigar truly hoped you would experience.

, Open your cigar diary and begin the notes. Don't forget what you're tasting and smelling: write your impressions first. Then fill in the information about the cigar--company; country of origin of wrapper, binder and filler; vintage year, if applicable; size, length and ring gauge:


Corona 5 ½"" to 6"" 42 to 45
Panatela 5 ½"" to 6 ½"" 34 to 38
Lonsdale 6"" to 6 ½ "" 42 to 44
Churchill 6 ½"" to 7"" 46 to 48
Robusto 4 ½"" to 5"" 48 to 50
Toro 6"" to 6 ½"" 48 to 50
Presidente 7"" to 8 ½"" 52 to 60
Torpedo 5 ½"" to 6 ½ "" 46 to 52

, You should be turning it constantly, just to keep things as even as possible. Is it cooperating? The burn should be consistent and regular, without gouges of burning coals running up the side. Ideally, the burn will be consistent, manageable and even through the smoke.

, If it does, SPLENDID! Smoke it to the NUB! And report it highly in your diary. (Then go to a cigar website and report it highly there, too; especially the website from which you bought the cigar, if you bought it online.)

, Track your smokes consistently, using the same scale. Note truly wonderful cigars for your palate, so you know what to order next time (and watch for deals on that brand, length and ring gauge).

, Note it at the top of the page in your cigar diary. Review often.

Poke holes in a large Ziploc bag and place the cigar box inside.,
Take a second bag and place a damp sponge inside.,
Seal the bag with the cigars inside the second bag.,
Find an out of the way place to leave the two bags to take effect.",How to Rehydrate Cigars2," Take a Ziploc bag spacious enough to fit the entire cigar box inside and poke small holes in both sides of the bag to ventilate it. Insert the open cigar box inside the bag and seal it.A quart-sized bag will probably be sufficient for most smaller cigar boxes; anything bigger will likely require a gallon-sized bag.
Don’t make the holes too large, or the cigars may become oversaturated as they sit. A paperclip or the point of a knife should work fine for poking small holes.

, Wet a sponge and ring out the excess water. Place the sponge at the bottom of a second, larger Ziploc bag. This will provide an artificial source of moisture from which the cigars can be revived.


Make sure to use a new sponge, and, if possible, wet it with bottled or distilled water. Old, used sponges and tap water are filled with bacteria and chemicals that can cause your cigars to mold.Re-wet the sponge every couple of days when you rotate the cigars.

, Slide the ventilated bag containing the open cigar box into the second bag containing the sponge. Seal the second bag to lock in the moisture of the sponge, which will slowly diffuse through the ventilated bag and into the dry cigars. Rehydration with this method will probably take a week or longer.


Don’t let the cigars become wet. A wet cigar is a separate problem.

, Take a look at the bags every couple of days to re-wet the sponge and test to see if the cigars are absorbing moisture. Rotate each cigar a quarter turn for even moisture distribution; switch up their positions inside the box if necessary.

Leave the cigar box in your bathroom.,
Take the box out and open the lid while you shower.,
Turn the cigars intermittently.,
Be careful not to overhydrate the cigars.",How to Rehydrate Cigars3," Store the cigar box on a shelf or inside a cabinet in the bathroom where you take your daily shower. The cigars will become a fixture in your bathroom for a week or two while they undergo the rehydration process.If you prefer, you can store the box of cigars out in the open. Many cigar boxes are of rich, ornate construction and will just look like eye-catching decorative pieces while they’re being salvaged.

, Every day before showering, take the cigars box out and open the lid. Place the box on the sink or toilet seat somewhere within a few feet of the shower. Once you’re done showering, close the lid of the box and return it to where it’s being stored. The humidity from the shower will be trapped inside the box and begin seeping into the cigars.Be extremely careful not to let the cigars get wet.
It may be best to keep especially hot showers down to 10-20 minutes, as the temperature of the water will produce a higher concentration of steam.

, Every other day when you bring the cigar box out before your shower, rotate the cigars. As you do, take note of the appearance and feel of the cigars. Shuffle them around in the box every 3-4 days so that any layer or section of the box doesn’t receive more or less moisture than another.As they soak up moisture, most cigars will feel supple and slightly sticky to the touch, and may darken in color somewhat.

, It’s important not to allow them to remain in the exceptionally humid bathroom environment for long than necessary, as an overhydrated cigar is an equally difficult and time-consuming fix. Inspect the cigars regularly to see how they’re coming along. If storing the cigars near your shower seems to be hydrating them too rapidly, employ an alternate method, like leaving them open in a damp cellar.


You should check on the cigars and their rehydration environment frequently to make sure that storage conditions haven’t changed unexpectedly.
Once cigars are rehydrated, they should be moved to humidity-controlled storage or smoked right away.

Choose your desired flavor.,
Select a suitable cigar.,
Prepare cotton pads to soak with your flavoring.,
Soak your flavoring pads with the flavoring.,
Stash your cigar with the flavoring pad.,
Place the baggie in your humidor.,
Enjoy your flavored cigar.",How to Flavor Cigars or Pipe Tobacco1," The kind of flavor you desire in your cigar will influence the kind of cigar you use when flavoring. The flavoring you use should come in a liquid form or should extractable to a liquid form., Most cigars already come with a certain flavor profile, so you should be careful when selecting the cigar you want to infuse with flavor. Some flavor profiles might not pair well with the flavor you want to infuse. Generally, you can expect that:


Cigars with a smooth and/or buttery flavor profile will often pair well with lighter, fruitier flavors. These are excellent for sunshiny, open-air smoking.
Cigars with deep and rich flavor profiles match well with liquor flavors, like whiskey and rum., You can use absorbent, sterile cotton pads to flavor your cigars. These are available at most pharmacies and drug stores, and can usually be found in the first aid section. Cut the cotton pads into 1½"" (3.8 cm) squares for each of the cigars you want to flavor.

, Depending on the strength of your flavoring agent, you may need to douse your flavoring pad completely or apply a few drops. This pad will be placed in a Ziploc plastic baggie with your cigar to infuse it with the flavoring that has soaked into your pad.


In most cases, you'll have to douse your flavoring pad, but if using essential oils, or similarly potent flavorings, you'll likely only want a few drops maximum.
If you plan on storing your cigars outside of a humidor, you can maintain humidity in the plastic baggie by soaking a second pad per each cigar in distilled water. Keep the water soaked pad with the flavoring pad in the baggie.If cotton pads are not an option, you can also use paper towel squares cut to the same dimensions as the cotton flavoring pad. You may want your paper towel square to be a few layers thick to improve its absorbency., First you'll need to remove your cigar from its packaging, if necessary. Then you'll want to store your cigar with the flavoring pad so the cigar can infuse with the flavoring, but you don't want the cigar to touch the pad. This could cause your flavoring to become too strong. Insert each cigar you're flavoring in separate medium sized plastic baggies with the flavoring pad, and use tissue paper to keep the two apart.When preparing several cigars of different flavor, it can be easy to mix up which is which. You may want to write the flavor on the outside of the baggie to prevent confusion later on., It will take some time for your cigar to infuse with the flavor of the pad you have stored it with. Depending on the strength of the flavor you used, this could take anywhere from a few days to several weeks.When checking to see if your cigar is ready to be separated from the flavor pad, remove the cigar from the baggie and allow it to sit for a while, then smell it closely. If the original scent of the cigar is fully blended with the scent of your flavoring pad, the flavor has infused.
It may take some trial and error before you get the knack for how long your cigars need to be infused. Depending on the cigar you use and the flavoring, storing it longer may result in a stronger flavor.
If you do not have a humidor, a piece of gauze or paper towel moistened with distilled water can help maintain the moisture of the cigar while in the baggie.

, Now that your cigar is infused with new flavor, it's ready to smoke or store. Once you get the hang of this simple method for infusing your cigars with flavor, you can start experimenting with different mixtures of flavor, like vanilla and cherry, for example.

Repeat the process again.,
Store cigars properly.,
Limit how often you open your humidor.,

Store your humidor safely.",How to Prepare a Humidor," You can get most materials you need at a local hardware store or department store. However, you also need a hygrometer. This is a device that measures moisture in the atmosphere. You may be able to find one at a drug, department, or hardware store. If you can't find one, buy one online. You will also need the following:Distilled water
A plastic bag
A cloth or rag
A sponge;
, This will make sure the hygrometer can adequately measure moisture. Take a take a towel and get it damp. Use only warm water.Wrap the hygrometer in the towel. Set it aside for 30 minutes.
Remove the hygrometer in the towel and calibrate it so it reads 95 to 97%. Each hygrometer will be calibrated differently. Refer to your manufacturer's instructions to figure out how to calibrate yours.
If your hygrometer already reads 95 to 97% when you remove it from the towel, it is ready to use. You do not need to calibrate it.

, If your humidor is new, you may not need to clean it. However, if you're preparing an older humidor, clean it out quickly before proceeding with the process.If there is any old tobacco or debris in your humidor, spray the inside of the humidor with compressed air.
Wipe down the interior of the humidor with a damp rag.

, Most humidors will come with a small, circular humidifier. If yours does not, you can order one online or buy one at a tobacco shop. Fill a bowl with distilled water. Place the humidifier in the bowl so it is completely submerged.Keep the humidifier face down. Leave it submerged for 2 to 3 minutes.
Wipe off any excess water with a paper towel when you remove the humidor.
Make sure you use distilled water. Tap water can damage a humidor.

, Open your humidor. Line the bottom with a plastic bag. Get a sponge damp, using distilled water, and place the sponge on top of the plastic bag., These are installed on the inside lid of your humidor. You should be able to figure out where to install by seeing where the pieces fit. If you're unsure, refer to your humidor's instructions manual.Once the hygrometer and humidifier are in place, close the humidor.
Set the humidor aside somewhere where it will not be disturbed. Leave it closed for 12 to 24 hours.

, After 12 to 24 hours have passed, you will repeat this whole process again. Submerge the humidifier in water and line the humidor with a plastic bag and a sponge. Then, install the humidifier and the hygrometer and set the humidor aside for 12 to 24 hours.Once you're done, the humidity level should be between 65% and 75%. It may be slightly higher right after you complete the process. Give the moisture levels a few minutes to go down.
Your humidor may not be between 65% and 75% after repeating the process a second time. In this case, you'll need to repeat the process one more time.

, You should remove the paper wrapping of a cigar before storing it in your humidor. Cigars that are stifled by wrapping will not breathe well. This will prevent them from being seasoned and flavored, which is the point of a humidor., You want to keep humidity levels stable. Opening your humidor too often makes the inside lose moisture. Only open your humidor when you need to get a cigar. Take one out quickly and then close the humidor., A humidor's moisture level should be between 65 and 75%. Check the hygrometer once in awhile to make sure that the level has not dropped.In the event the humidity has dropped, you will have to repeat the preparation process. You would remoisten the humidor the same way you initially prepared it.
Make sure to use distilled water when you repeat the process. This is just as important the second time around as it was the first. Tap water can harm the humidor.

, A humidor should be stored in an area away from sunlight. You should also keep your humidor away from heat or air conditioning ducts, as well as interior lighting.A drawer is a good place to store a humidor.
If you have children or animals, keep the humidor out of their reach.

Pull the cigar out little by little.,
Remove the cigar completely from the wrapper.,
Roll the cigar to remove the filter paper.,
Carefully refill the empty cigar.,
Clear any loose tobacco from the plastic tip.,
Enjoy.",How to Freak a Black & Mild Cigar," Do not remove the cigar from its plastic wrapper. Because each Black 'n Mild comes individually wrapped, you can use the wrapper to collect the tobacco while you work it out of the cigar.


Since you'll need to pour the tobacco back into the cigar at the end, snipping the plastic tip makes for a nice clean surface to pour back from, rather than tearing it open with your fingers, which leave a raggedy end that'll make a mess.
Some people like to cut the open end of the wrapper to form a ""scoop."" Cut the tip diagonally, to create a pointed end that will make it easier to pour the tobacco back in when you're finished.;
, Basically, you want to work all the tobacco out of the cigar and into the plastic wrapper. Use your fingers and feel around the Black & Mild to make sure the tobacco is loose inside.


Some of the tobacco will start falling into the bottom of the wrapper as you do this. That's good. As you roll the cigar in your fingers, it should start working its way out of the wrapper, tip-end first.
Make sure to keep the plastic wrapper uncreased and unbent while you do this. Be careful to not tear the cigar paper or the plastic wrapper.

, Continue rolling or tapping the tobacco out of the cigar into the plastic wrapper. Go slowly and make sure you catch all the tobacco in the wrapper. You may need to start pushing the tobacco down in the wrapper a little to make room for more.


Once you've emptied most of the tobacco out of the Black & Mild, start squeezing the base of the plastic tip to break up the tobacco stuck toward the end. Do not remove the plastic tip, unless you want to smoke without it.

, When you've worked all the tobacco out, you should have a plastic wrapper filled with tobacco and an empty Black 'n Mild with the filter paper still inside.

, Take the empty cigar and roll it with your finger tips lightly until the filter paper starts rolling up on itself. Eventually, you'll be able to grab and remove the filter paper with your finger tips or nails. Throw it away.


You can also use the filter paper as a filter without burning it. Cut about an inch of it and roll it into a very tight ball. Insert it into the cigar before packing the tobacco back in. This will prevent the tobacco from getting into your mouth while smoking, and will create a kind of filter without having to burn it.

, Pour the tobacco very slowly back into the empty cigar. As you fill the paper up, every so often tap the plastic tip on a hard object or use a pen bottom to pack the tobacco back into the paper.


Be careful not to overfill the cigar. It's hard to get all the tobacco in, so don't force it and risk ripping the paper. Some people like to leave a bit of room at the tip and fold the paper over until they're ready to smoke, so no tobacco falls out in the meantime.

, When full and packed, you can remove the plastic tip to clear the tobacco if you want to. Shake the tobacco loose or blow through it before pushing it back on.


You can also just try to blow the tobacco out and leave the tip on. Sometimes the tip can be kind of hard to get back on straight, so its best to leave it on if you intend to smoke with the plastic tip on the cigar.

, You're ready to smoke.

Determine your target flavor.,
Acquire your tobacco.,
Place your tobacco into an airtight container.,
Add your flavoring agent to the tobacco.,
Seal the container and allow the flavor to infuse.,
Remove the tobacco and let it dry.,
Reapply your flavoring agent to intensify the flavor.,
Store your tobacco in an airtight container.",How to Flavor Cigars or Pipe Tobacco2," Knowing the flavor you are aiming for will help you pick out the best tobacco to use for the flavoring process. Pipe tobacco, much like cigars, has a base flavor profile that may or may not go with certain flavors. Whichever flavor you decide on, you'll want it to come in liquid form.

, There are many different kinds of tobacco you could flavor, and many of them have unique base flavors that could affect the end result of your flavoring. Some popular kinds of tobacco you may want to consider include:


Virginia tobacco. This comes in many varieties (red, black, lemon, etc.), each with slight differences in character. It is generally considered a mild leaf that has a light taste and is also sweet.
Burley tobacco. Burley is a dryer form of tobacco, making it more receptive to flavoring. You can expect this kind to burn slow and have a cool flavor.
Oriental tobacco. This kind of tobacco covers many different sub-categories, like the kinds grown in Turkey and Russia. In most cases, you'll find that this leaf is dry and has a moderately sour aroma., This ensures your flavoring agent permeates your tobacco when it is added and also helps to prevent spillage. Spread your tobacco around the container so it is in an even layer. This will encourage an even distribution of your flavoring.


A snuff box/snus tin can be made relatively airtight by covering the edges of the box/tin where it opens with tape. Electrical tape or duct tape work well for this purpose.
Sturdy tupperware containers also work well for this, though you should make sure that the one you use is airtight for best results.
A durable plastic baggie can work well as a substitute for a container. One with a double seal will often provide a more airtight barrier for your tobacco.
While getting the hang of flavoring your tobacco, you may want to start flavoring in small batches. This way, if you make a mistake when flavoring, less tobacco is wasted.

, You can drizzle your liquid flavoring over your tobacco, but you may find you have a better distribution of flavor when using an atomizer, like a spray bottle. Use your flavoring agent sparingly. In many cases a single capful of liquor/liqueur will be enough to flavor several ounces of tobacco, depending on your preferences.


Essential oils are very potent, so when using these to flavor your tobacco you should dilute the oil in distilled water., To help the infusing process along, as well as encourage a uniform distribution of flavor, you should shake your container so the tobacco mixes thoroughly with the flavoring. Then, you'll have to give the tobacco time to absorb the flavor.


Depending on the kind of tobacco and flavoring agent you've used, keeping the tobacco in the container for longer may create a stronger flavor.
Generally, your tobacco will have sufficiently infused with your flavor in one to five hours., Open your container and spread your tobacco in a thin layer on a piece of parchment paper or paper towel. You'll need to give your tobacco some time to dry before adding more flavoring to it.


When your tobacco is approaching your desired level of moistness, you should sniff it to determine the potency of the flavor. If the scent of the flavoring is weak, you'll likely need to apply another round of flavoring.
In most cases, an hour should be enough for your tobacco to reach the level of moisture common in most kinds of pipe tobacco., If you find that your tobacco has not yet reached the potency or level of moisture that you desire, return your tobacco to the airtight container and apply the flavoring agent as you did before. After allowing time for infusion, remove the tobacco and allow it to dry until it is at your preferred level of moistness.

, Mason jars are available at most grocery stores and are excellent for this purpose, so long as you buy the kind with an airtight rubber seal. You could also use tupperware or the kind of airtight jars often used to keep coffee fresh. Remove your tobacco from the jar whenever you want to smoke and enjoy.Thrift stores are a great place to purchase cheap airtight containers. You'll want to look for those that have a rubber seal on the lid. You can check air tightness by sealing the container and submerging it in water. If no water leaks in, it's airtight.
As long as the seal on your container is not broken, your tobacco can keep for a long period of time. Airtight seals should be used for any storage exceeding 2 months.
You should check your tobacco regularly to ensure the seal has not broken and the tobacco is still good. Once a month should be enough to prevent major losses.

Experiment with combining flavors.",How to Flavor Cigars or Pipe Tobacco3," It is very common for cigars to tobacco to be infused with fruit flavors, like cherry, apricot, and blackcurrant. Alcoholic drinks are also popular for tobacco infusion, especially:


Rum
Whiskey
Wine, Liqueurs are generally strong flavored alcohols with a pungent scent. Common liqueurs include flavors like amaretto, coffee, chocolate, berry flavors, hazelnut, melon, and anisette (licorice flavor).


Creamy or sugary liqueurs can create stickiness in your tobacco and should probably be avoided or used extremely sparingly., Popular essential oils used in tobacco flavoring include citrus flavors, like lemon and orange, flower scents, like lavender and rose, and more. You should always look up the usage information of an essential oil before using it in your infusions. Some essential oils are not safe to ingest or smoke.


Essential oils are very potent and should be used very sparingly for your tobacco infusions. In most cases, a few drops on a flavoring pad or diluted in water or a carrier liquid (for pipe tobacco) will be enough., Coffee is a popular flavor that is used in everything from liquor to candy, and coffee might add a pleasing flavor to your tobacco.You may be able to store fresh ground coffee tied off in a filter with tobacco/cigars to impart this flavor to it.


When infusing cigars, you should probably keep the cigar from touching the grounds directly. Cigars are very absorbent, and an overpowering infusion could ruin the cigar.

, You may have noticed that some of the more nuanced flavored tobaccos use more than one flavor in its profile. You may want to imitate these or try a new combination of your own to create a unique, personal flavoring for your tobacco. Some combinations you might want to try include:


Blackcurrant and wineVanilla and cherry
Cinnamon and whiskey
Coffee and amaretto

Select the correct end of the cigar to cut.,
Identify where the ""shoulder"" of the cigar ends.,
Pick up your cigar cutter between your thumb and forefinger using your dominant hand.

,
Place the cigar into the cutter and close one eye in order to line up the cigar correctly.,
Cut the cigar quickly in one fluid motion, with as much force as you can.",How to Cut a Cigar1," This is the end of the cigar that goes in your mouth and is called the head of a cigar. The opposite end of the cigar is known as the foot. The head is distinguishable by the fact that it has a cap on it, a round piece of tobacco that is stuck onto the head in order to keep the wrapper of the cigar together.


The head is also usually easily distinguishable because it's the end closest to the logo sticker wrapped around the cigar.;
, The shoulder is where the curved end of the cigar starts to straighten out.Right above the shoulder, where the curve is still intact, is where you'll you want to cut.

,, Line it up so that you're cutting right above the shoulder of the cigar.


Remember that it's better to cut too little than too much. You can always go back and cut more cigar off, but it's impossible to go back and put already-cut cigar back on. Better to be safe than sorry.

, Keep a tight grip on the cigar with your other hand and try not to let it move until it is cut all the way through.


Quickness is key here. You want the guillotine to slice through the cigar quickly, not tear through it slowly.
Make sure to grab a sharp cutter. Like a kitchen knife, the sharper your guillotine the better. Unless disaster strikes (it won't), you'll never regret having a sharper implement.

Determine for how long you want to smoke.,
Choose a shape.,
Choose a gauge.,
Inspect your cigar.",How to Choose a Cigar1," This will help you choose a size. A wider, longer cigar will take longer to smoke. If you only have twenty minutes to smoke, choose a thinner, shorter cigar. If you have a few hours to nurse your cigar, choose one with a larger diameter.


Size has nothing to do with flavor, so do not worry about sacrificing flavor if you decide on a smaller cigar. The taste is determined by the tobacco that constitutes the inside and outside wrapping of a cigar. ;
, Cigars come in many different shapes. Ask the tobacconist to show you a few different shapes and hold them in your hand to see which you prefer.


The two main groups of cigar shapes are parejos and figurados. Parejos are straight-sided cigars, while figurados include any cigar with an irregular shape. Try out both types to help you narrow down your search.

, A cigar's gauge, or diameter, is measured in 64ths of an inch. A larger gauge will take longer to smoke. It will also mean less of the flavor is coming from the wrapper, and more from the tobacco inside of the cigar.

, The outside of a cigar can reveal a lot about your smoke. In cigars, you really can judge a book by its cover. Make sure there are no tears, flakes or gaps in the wrapping that might make it difficult to smoke. Check the moisture. Make sure the cigar does not look dry. It will not burn properly if it has not been well humidified. Gently squeeze along the cigar. Make sure that it is firmly packed. If there are weak spots at any point in the cigar, it will fall apart as you smoke it.

Don't assume more expensive means better.,
Pick a mild or medium-bodied cigar.,
Go for something on the larger side as a beginner.,
Ask the tobacconist for help.,
Cut the cigar.,
Draw through the cigar.,
Pick between using a cedar spill, a butane lighter, or a match.,
Toast the foot of the cigar.,
Light the cigar.,
Get the cigar started.,
Deal with the brand band.,
Don't inhale.,
Don't smoke it too quickly.,
Ash the cigar properly.,
Let it put itself out when done.",How to Enjoy a Cigar," A rookie mistake when it comes to choosing a cigar to go for the most expensive one available in an attempt to impress. Someone who's new to cigars won't be able to distinguish the subtle differences between a high-end and a mid-tier cigar anyway. So go for something reasonably priced., A full strength cigar might be too much for someone who's just starting out. Pick something rated as mild or medium-bodied until you've got more experience with cigars., A lot of beginners make the mistake of going for a smaller, thinner cigar when starting out, thinking it will be easier to handle. The opposite is actually the case. A smaller cigar will burn faster, and the hot part will be closer to your mouth. Smaller cigars make for a more intense experience that should be saved until you're a pro.

, Let the tobacconist know how often you smoke, how much you're looking to spend, and anything else related to your smoking preferences. Utilize their knowledge of cigars. They'll be glad to help you pick the right one.You should be buying your cigar at a shop made for such a thing. Good cigars need to be kept at a certain level of humidity, so a cheap cigar from the drugstore won't do for proper enjoyment.

, If not pre-cut, use a clipper to cut an edge at the mouth end of the cigar. Most recommend guillotine clippers for beginners. You want to cut off enough to get a good draw, but not so much that the cigar starts to unravel. Cut just below the seam or shoulder of the head, where it starts to slope.If you don't have a clipper and you're at a bar, ask the bartender if they will lend you one.

, This step isn't necessary, but it's a way to test the quality of the cigar. Draw through the cigar before lighting it and make sure it draws smoothly. If not, you can try cutting a little farther down the head so that more air flows through, but be careful not to cut too far., You have a number of choices when it comes to lighting your cigar.Cigarette lighters, like Zippos, should be avoided, as the extra chemicals can affect the taste, and you'll look very inexperienced holding a Zippo to a cigar.
Torch lighters are both easy to use and effective.
Matches are an option, but harder for beginners, because you'll need to use multiple matches.
For the most enjoyment and class, use a cedar spill. Most manufacturers of premium cigars include thin sheets of cedar with their cigar packages. The cedar will impart extra flavor into the cigar as you light with it.

, Before lighting the cigar, you want to prime it. Hold the tip of the cigar just above the flame. Spin the cigar and get the tip evenly heated by the flame., Continue to toast the foot of the cigar. Once you see the first signs of smoke, put the cigar to your mouth and puff gently. Fill your mouth with smoke while you continue holding the foot just above the flame. Take your mouth of the cigar and exhale. Continue holding the foot just above the flame until it glows evenly and brightly. You'll know your cigar is fully lit when the whole foot glows bright orange., Fill your mouth with smoke and then exhale it out. Do this four or five times to get the cigar going., Whether or not you remove the band on the cigar is up to you. Most prefer to leave it on because taking it off can risk tearing the paper. Also, the band works as convenient reference point for where to hold the cigar., Draw from your lit cigar but don't inhale the smoke. Instead, let it linger in your mouth for a few seconds. Enjoying a cigar is about the flavor of the smoke in your mouth, not getting it in your lungs. Even most long-time cigar smokers don't inhale, as the smoke is very harsh on your lungs, and inhaling into your lungs adds nothing valuable to the experience.To avoid inhaling, imagine you're sucking liquid through a straw, rather than breathing in air.When you exhale, exhale slowly. If you have the skill, you can even blow a smoke ring or two while doing so!

, Smoking your cigar too quickly will cause it to burn too hot. This will affect the flavor in a negative way. Cigars burn slowly, and are made to be enjoyed leisurely. For a rule of thumb, take a draw every 30 to 60 seconds or so., Don't try ashing the cigar until the ash is at least an inch long. If the ash won't budge, continue to wait before ashing. Good cigars only need to be ashed once or twice. The longer the ash stays on the cigar, the better its quality.If you don't have an ashtray handy, you can ash the cigar in the grass. Premium cigars are natural, so they won't harm anything.

, Don't put the cigar out like a cigarette by snuffing it out. When you're done smoking, simply place the cigar with the foot end in the middle of the ashtray. It will go out on its own.If your cigar starts to go out before you're finished, simply ash it and relight it. However, if it's gone completely cold you're best off getting a new cigar, as the taste will be tainted.

Run a pipe cleaner through the pipe before you use it.,
Clean the pipe after each smoke.,
Notice the signs that your pipe needs cleaning.,
Let the pipe sit before smoking.",How to Clean a Wood Pipe1," Even if you have cleaned your pipe after the last time you used it, you should always clean it before you smoke it. Take a pipe cleaner and run it through the pipe. This helps get rid of any remaining ash or dottle.Gently knock the pipe in your palm to get the debris from the bowl.;
, You should always clean your pipe after you smoke. Never allow the ash and debris to remain in the pipe. However, make sure you let the pipe cool completely before cleaning. Never clean while it is warm.If you remove the stem while it is warm, it will mess up the fit of the stem and cause cracks in the pipe.

, As you smoke your pipe, you will be able to tell if it needs a good cleaning. The taste should be pleasant when you smoke. If you start to notice a change in taste, such as a salty, sour, or bad taste, you probably need to clean it., Because you cleaned your pipe with alcohol, you want to make sure that you let the pipe sit for at least a day, if not more, before smoking. This ensures that the alcohol completely evaporates."

Determine, how many cigars you want to store in your humidor.,
Now that you have a number to work with, do some homework.,
Don't limit your search, Humidors are sold in many different places.Try department stores, specialty stores, the local tobacconist and even online.,
So, you have exhausted your search.,
There are essentially, three different types of Humidors.,
Take a moment to examine the area where you have decided to place your new Humidor.,
Now that you have a pretty good idea of what you want.,
The liner of the humidor (the wood on the sides and bottom as well as any trays or dividers) is also very important.,
The warranty!,
When you are ready, buy it.",How to Choose a Humidor," Then, double that number. (Example: if you would like to store 25-50 cigars you want a humidor that will hold 50-100)This is where you want to start. You can always keep less in a larger space, but you can not put more into a smaller space.;
, Seek out all the humidors you can that will accommodate, that number of cigars. For now, don't worry about prices, style, color or shape. Look at them all, get a feel for just how many different types there are.

, Don't stop now!!1 I'm sure you can think of one or two other places to look, be proactive.

, You have basked in the glory, of many different types of Humidors. Now, it's time to start to narrow them down. Your first question should be, where will I keep my Humidor? Will it be in your office, your living room or maybe you have a recreational room you would like to display it in. Where you decide to keep it, is almost as limitless as the kinds of Humidors available.

, Table or desk top, freestanding and full room. As a beginner, you may not want to consider a full room or walk-in type Humidor. If you are not a beginner, and are considering a walk-in. Go For It!!1 However, that is a WikiHow of a different color.

, Notice the existing furniture, the colors and style you have chosen for this space. This is where you will drastically, start to narrow your choices. You don't want it to clash, rather you want it to blend in. You want to accentuate the current décor, with a new addition.

, Lets take a look, at some of the more important properties. Start with the seal, The seal is one of the most important properties of a humidor. Without a good seal, it will be nearly impossible to regulate the climate inside the Humidor. The easiest way to check a Humidors seal, is to lift the lid about three to four (3-4) inches, then release the lid and let it fall closed. It should make a ""whoosh"" sound. You'll know the sound when you hear it, trust me. If you do not hear a ""whoosh"" sound as it closes, you may want to try a different Humidor.

, The liner in a quality Humidor, will be made of Spanish Cedar that has been kiln dried. It is kiln dried to remove any sap and moisture.

, This is also important, especially to newer aficionados. If you made something and you knew it was of good quality, would you hesitate to give a warranty? Not likely! So make sure the Humidor has a minimum, of 30 day warranty.

, Take it home, enjoy it. You're not done there though. Make sure you follow these steps https://www.wikihow.com/Season-a-Humidor before storing your Cigars!

Take a quick measurement of the climate.,
Store a few cigars in an open plastic bag until you're ready to smoke.,
Keep it in the cellophane or tube while in transit.,
Keep it out of the fridge.,
Ask for a box at the cigar store.",How to Store a Cigar1," A good cigar is like a living, breathing thing: it needs to be in a very nice temperatured room, or it can dry out very quickly. If you've come across a good cigar but don't want to smoke it that day, you can take a few simple steps to keep it fresh.


A cigar should be stored around 70 degrees F, with a humidity of around 70%. In some climates, like Miami, a cigar can be left in its wrapper and stored for a short period of time without much concern for freshness. If you're in Arizona or Alaska, however, the dryness will likely need to be addressed if you need to store the cigar for more than 24 hours.The tobacco in good cigars was grown in a tropical climate, somewhere between 65 and 72% humidity. Cigars are made from whole wrapped sheets of tobacco, and the construction relies upon them staying oily and moist. Cigars not stored at the optimum temperature and humidity can dry out, crack, or mold.
If you're a burgeoning aficionado and want to store lots of cigars for any length of time, you need to purchase a humidor and store your cigars in it. Skip to the next method.;
, If you've got a cigar or two but can't smoke it right away, the best way to store it is in an open ziplock bag with a slightly-moist towel at the mouth of the bag, in a dark space kept at around 70 degrees.


Humidor bags are commonly sold at many cigar retailers, which can keep cigars fresh for several weeks. At good cigar shops, the tobacconist will often ask you about how long you're going to keep the cigar, and might pack the cigar in one of these bags anyway. Talk it out and ask; you stand to learn a lot.
The towel should be clean and only very slightly moist, preferably with distilled water. After a few hours, check on the bag to make sure no dampness is accumulating inside. If so, open the bag more and pull the towel back slightly. Cigars can and do mold.
Alternatively, cigars can be stored in a clean plastic tub, covered with a very-slightly damp, almost entirely dry towel and kept at the proper temperature. However you choose to store your cigars, the temperature is the most important factor.

, If your cigar came wrapped in a cellophane wrapper, or came in a cedar sleeve, or other type of tube, it's perfectly fine to keep it in the wrapper until you plan on smoking it. Cellophane will allow air to get to the cigar, while other types of tubes and sleeves will protect the cigar during transportation.


Cigar enthusiasts differ on the topic of removing cigars from sleeves or storing them in sleeves for longer periods of time. For short periods of time, there's nothing to worry about. All cigar smokers agree, though: for longer than a day or two, you either need to smoke it or get it in a humidor.

, It's a common misconception that freezing or refrigerating cigars is an effective way of keeping them fresh. Nothing could be further than the truth, unless you want a cigar that tastes like refrigerator. Even if the cigar is overheated, or the temperature is too humid, or not humid enough, never keep your cigar in the refrigerator.


Cigars aren't stored in perfectly-sealed environments, because they need to breathe. Don't put a cigar into a plastic box with a sealable lid, or keep it in the freezer, unless you want to ruin it. Cigars stored with a moist towel in a plastic box will likely become over-saturated, and could even mold after a short time.
If there's absolutely nowhere to store your cigar at 70/70, keep it in a relatively cool place in your house, if you live in a warm climate during summer, or keep them in the kitchen (the warmest room in the house) if its winter in a cool climate. Spritz some water periodically into the air to work a bootleg humidifier into the equation. It's not ideal, but you can save a good cigar some grief. Or you could always just smoke it.

, When you're buying, if you know you don't have someplace to store the cigar, and you know you won't want to smoke it right away, ask for advice at the store, and ask if they've got an old cigar boxes lying around, preferably cedar for purchase or for free. Sometimes, they'll just give them to you. Kept in a cigar box, in a cool room, cigars will be fine for a while.

Get a cigar punch.,
Pick an appropriate punch size, if possible, and push the blade into the cap.

,
After the blade is inserted into the cap, rotate it to fully cut a hole into the cap, then remove the blade.",How to Cut a Cigar2," A cigar punch just punches a hole through the head of the cigar. There are, however, three different kinds of cigar punches available:


Bullet punch: Fits on a keychain, it twists to expose a circular blade that cuts into the head of the cigar.
Havana punch: Safer than a bullet punch, it has a recessed tip that can be fitted into the cigar head, and which draws out the tobacco plug after a cut is made.
Multi-punch: Offers more sizes for punching different sizes of cigars.

,, the cut portion will come out as well.

"
Use a v-cutter for more draw on a cigar.,
Hold the cigar in one hand, and the v-cutter in your other (dominant) hand, with the ends pulled open.

,
Put the cigar into the cutter's indentation.,
Pushing the cigar toward the cutter, squeeze the two ends of the cutter together.",How to Cut a Cigar3," A v-cutter will give the cigar smoker a bigger draw by cutting deeper into the head of the cigar. One drawback of the v-cutter is that it sometimes produces too big of a draw, making the cigar smoke too hot.A very good v-cutter will sit on a table, but is too big to carry with you. A small one is the same size as any other small cutter and can cost as little as $4.00.
A v-cutter will not remove too much from the head of the cigar, which can result in the unwrapping of the cigar.

,, Take care not to wedge the head of the cigar too deep into the v-cutter, or the cut may be too big.

, Remove any loose tobacco by tapping the cigar on an ashtray or by blowing lightly into the wedge.

"
"
Understand that biting is imprecise and may result in a poor smoke.,
Place your teeth in the same manner as with the guillotine cutter.

,
Gently bite a few times while rotating the cigar.

,
After a few bites while rotating the cigar, the cap will be separated and can be removed by hand or mouth.

",How to Cut a Cigar4," While this method is often discouraged, it will work in a pinch. Even so, if you have a choice of a straight, punch, or wedge cut, opt for those instead of biting the cap off.

Be wary of ordering cigars online.",How to Find and Buy Genuine Cuban Cigars," When searching for a place to buy authentic Cuban cigars, check out whether or not the storefront advertises that they’re licensed to sell official Cuban tobacco products. Top-tier brands like Habanos, Cohiba and Romeo y Julieta will almost always be found in high-end stores, not on a flimsy convenience store rack. In some cases, vendors will carry certificates of authenticity and other documentation that what they’re selling is legitimate.You’ll rarely find Cuban cigars with prestigious brand names in a bodega, quick-stop or curio shop. Seek out businesses that specialize in fine tobacco.
Ask the salesperson to show you a certificate pointing out the legitimacy of the cigars they’re selling, or credentials for carrying a particular brand.;
, As a rule, the further you are from Cuba (with the exception of the United States), the less likely you are to find real Cuban cigars. Tobacco is one of Cuba’s top exports, but due to long-standing bans and embargoes on Cuban products, the chances of finding a genuine Montecristo or Bolivar in a faraway place is slim. You may be able to turn up Cuban cigars in places that trade openly with Cuba, like Guatemala, Nicaragua or The Dominican Republic, but even these should be inspected to verify their authenticity.As of 2016, it is legal to bring a limited number of cigars (up to $100 worth) back into the United States from Cuba, but they cannot be sold within the US. There also still exist numerous restrictions on where certain Cuban products can be bought and how much can pass through Customs., As a tourist, you should never buy a cigar being sold by someone on the beach, at a street kiosk or out of someone’s apartment room. These are almost always fakes. In some cases, workers who roll the cigars at the factories will sell imitations marketed as the real thing, but these are filled and rolled with leftover scraps of tobacco, and can be unpleasant or even dangerous to smoke. Stick to tobacco stores selling licensed goods, or places like hotels that double as official vendors.Just as you wouldn’t expect to buy an actual Rolex from someone with a blanket of watches laid out on the sidewalk, you should be skeptical of cigars being passed off as legitimate in dubious locations or places where tourist traffic is high.

, Most cigar factories will have stores nearby that sell their products, if not inside the factories themselves. This is the best place to start looking. Tobacco parlors in the vicinity of where Quinteros are rolled, for instance, are more likely to sell genuine Quintero cigars. As you move away from the place of origin, you begin taking your chances more and more.While you’ll be able to find real cigars skirting around the factories where they’re rolled, there will also be an abundance of imitations. For this reason, you’ll also want to learn how to spot fake individual cigars yourself.
If you’re on the hunt for Cuban cigars outside of Cuba, play it safe and track down a licensed establishment.

, Real Cuban cigars will be sold in a tightly sealed, sturdy box bearing a few distinct markings. One is the official Habanos seal, which is a technically-complex holographic image, in upper right corner of the box. There will also be a pale green Cuban warranty seal wrapping around the lefthand side, which has been meticulously designed and printed to discourage counterfeiters. The bottom of the box will feature a heat-printed stamp reading “Habanos, S.A.” and “Hecho en Cuba,” along with essential details like a code identifying the factory where the cigars were rolled and the date they were packaged.Imitations are often sold in boxes with transparent glass or plastic lids. These peculiar lids are designed to satisfy you with a view of the product inside while keeping you from taking too close a look. Real cigars will always be sold in solid boxes that must be opened to view the cigars inside.
Keep an eye out for spelling and grammatical errors, cheap printing methods, peeling stickers, and warped, damaged or flimsy boxes. Counterfeiters usually don’t go to the trouble of reproducing the quality standards of the packaging., The band enclosing the cigar itself is one of the most telling indicators of authenticity. Official cigar bands will be printed with the highest quality materials, and are often holographic or embossed to make them immediately recognizable. Phony cigars will be banded with cheap stickers, usually dull in color and missing the sophisticated elements that characterize authentic cigars.The bands on fake cigars are often much larger than the bands on real ones, in the hopes of drawing the buyer’s attention to the brand name and away from the cigar itself.
Different cigar manufacturers print different unique bands, but all are made with painstaking attention to detail. Use common sense. If it doesn’t have the impressive flair of a real cigar band, it probably isn’t.

, If given the opportunity, take a cigar out of its box and put it to the test of your senses. Look to see if the color of the wrapper leaf is a rich, uniform light brown. Squeeze the cigar to feel if it’s firm all the way through. Most importantly, smell the ends of the cigar. If it doesn’t have a rich, complex aroma, you can bet that it isn’t what it claims to be.The inferior tobacco leaves used to wrap cheap cigars are brittle and prone to cracking, splitting and crumbling. They will also often be inconsistently colored, with a faded or mottled appearance.

, Imitation cigars are often made with extravagant extra touches or careless mistakes. You won’t find an authentic Cuban cigar with a braided or “Barber Pole” wrapper (alternating layers of dark and light colored leaves), or one that has been rolled with anything but Habanos-seed leaves. Counterfeiters also don’t typically have the means to replicate certain pressing features of the cigar, such as the straight-cut, flattened “foot” end. These types of nuances are subtle, but may help you differentiate between a good cigar and a shabby fabrication.A fake cigar will produce a bright white ash when it’s lit, whereas a real cigar will glow softly and leave a dark gray ash.

, When it comes to superior craftsmanship, you get what you pay for. The same is true for top-of-the-line Cuban cigars. Sure, you could get by spending $8-$10 per cigar from a vendor on the street, but an imitation cigar won’t have the complex flavor notes and rich, smooth feel of the genuine article. For a quality Cuban, you can expect to pay anywhere from $25 to $50 per cigar.Cuban cigars are expensive, even in Cuba. Contrary to the idea that they’re cheaper there because they’re more common, the makers of Cuban cigars know that their products will fetch a high price. They also understand that people will pay more for the experience of smoking a great cigar.
If you live in the United States, the recent lifting of the trade embargo with Cuba will make it possible for you to bring home real Cuban cigars, but only up to $100 worth. In most instances, this will only get you 3-4 good cigars., Because of how exquisitely made they are, Cuban cigars are always sold at full price. If you run into a pitch advertising any sort of discount offer on cigars of renown like Partagas or Cohiba, chances are you’re being conned. These second-rate fabrications may indeed be rolled using tobacco and materials from the factories they claim, but they will basically be comprised of scraps and won’t be exemplary of real Cuban cigars.Unlike other commercial goods, cigars are considered specialty craftsman goods, much like fine foods and aged liquor. It is rare that you will find these types of goods sold for less than what they’re worth.

, Each box of cigars will typically only be filled with between 10 and 20 cigars. You can be assured that packages identifying themselves as Punch or H. Upmann that contain 30 or more cigars, or that are being sold in batches at wholesale prices, are less than legitimate. Once again, if an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is.Wholesale deals are often made to unsuspecting tourists to trick them into thinking they’re getting more for their money. Don’t be fooled by these types of scams.
Due to their price point, Cuban cigars are often bought individually. Only people with a lot of money will be able to purchase an entire box of cigars at once, let alone multiple or suspiciously large boxes.

, In recent years, new security measures have been introduced by the Cuban government to discourage counterfeiting. These include a light green Warranty Seal and unique bar code wrapping around the left hand side of the box, a unreproducible holograph on the upper right corner and an official surgeon general’s warning. All are made using unique synthetic materials and processes that aren’t easily replicated. Look for these features before agreeing to pay for a box of cigars. If the stickers on the box look like they have been forged or tampered with, you may be dealing with fakes.Forged Warranty Seals and other stamps and stickers will usually appear cheaply made, have misspellings and lack any sophisticated security indicators like holographic images.Never buy a cigar or box of cigars if any of the adhesive components appear to have been broken, removed, replaced or applied carelessly.

, Since diplomatic relations have been reopened with Cuba, it's now possible for US residents to travel to the island nation. However, these trips require special licensing, and are only possible under certain provisions. If you happen to be a journalist, trade expert or humanitarian, or if you're visiting family, you get a free pass, but at the moment, cultural tourism is only allowed via expensive and highly-controlled group tours. If you're determined to bring back authentic cigars from Cuba yourself, this may be your most feasible option. Just be prepared to have your entire trip mapped out for you.For certain people, their work may permit them to engage in travel and exchange with Cuba. Some of these professions include journalism, political diplomacy, education, humanitarian aid, historical and cultural research and specialty medicine.Updated government sanctions only permit $100 worth of tobacco and alcohol products to pass through Customs on the way back to the United States. This equals a meager 2-3 quality Cuban cigars., It is possible to track down Cuban cigars in places other than Cuba. Another consequence of the relaxed international trade agreements with Cuba is that tobacco products can be legally sold in third-party countries like Britain, Canada and Mexico. That means that if you happen to be on a business trip to Montreal or vacationing in Cancun, you can easily find and purchase genuine Cuban cigars, no questions asked. Look for vendors and duty-free shops in these places and bypass the headache of dealing with Cuban travel regulations.The Habanos company manages the importing and exporting of brand-name Cuban cigars. You can often find stores licensed to carry cigars with the Habanos seal in major international cities., You might be able to find specialty tobacco websites advertising Cuban cigars for sale, but take caution when ordering from these places. It is still technically illegal to important anything into the US from Cuba without the proper say-so. Offenders risk being fined hundreds of thousands of dollars and even being tossed in jail for flagrant unlawful transactions. That hardly seems worth it for a couple hundred dollars worth of artisan cigars.Importing Cuban goods to the US must be done under the watchful eye of Customs agents and demands that you adhere to a specific set of legal guidelines.
When ordering online, there's also no way of knowing whether what you're buying is real or imitation.

, Cigars come in different brands based on their flavor, style, and country of origin. Cigars from different countries have different tastes based on the local soil and techniques used. Consider choosing a larger manufacturer if you are a beginner cigar smoker. More popular brands tend to be more successful and will likely allow you a more positive first time experience. , Cigar wrappers come in seven main colors depending on the shade of the wrapper. These colors correspond to different flavors and strengths. The wrapper will determine how the cigar looks and feels on your mouth. From lightest to darkest, claros, colorados, maduros and oscuras are the main color groupings for cigar wrappers. These varying colors will correspond to different depths of flavor. Decide which shade suits your taste.

, Decide whether you would like a mild or full-bodied cigar experience. Cigars can be intense, so if you are a beginner consider starting with a milder flavor. Consider what time of day you will be smoking your cigar. You may want a stronger flavor at night, or a milder smoke in the morning.
Cigars may range in aroma from sweet to spicy depending on the wrapper and tobacco used. The filling of a cigar is made up of the filler and binder. Filler tobacco is held to the wrapper by coarser binder tobacco. The combination of these two types of tobacco determine the varying flavor profiles of a cigar. "

Shake your pipe.,
Clean the pipe with a pipe cleaner.,
Wipe the mouthpiece.,
Wipe the pipe before putting it up.",How to Clean a Wood Pipe2," After the pipe has cooled, shake the pipe. Make sure to put a finger over the bowl so the ash doesn’t go everywhere. Do this for a few seconds. Then, pour the ash and debris out of the bowl.If you can’t get everything out when you pour, use the pipe tool with the spoon end to scoop out the ashes.
Shaking the pipe with the ash still in it helps to form cake on the inside of the bowl, which helps prolong the life of the pipe.

, After dumping the ash and dottle, blow through the stem to get rid of any excess ash and dottle. Then, use a pipe cleaner to clean the pipe. Start with a bristle pipe cleaner. Push the pipe cleaner through the stem of the pipe. The tip of the pipe cleaner should be the only part visible. Then remove it.Afterwards, you can use the other side of the pipe cleaner or use a clean pipe cleaner to do the same thing.
Do this until the pipe cleaner is clean when you remove it.

, Use a damp pipe cleaner to clean the mouthpiece. You can dampen the pipe cleaner with saliva. Rub the pipe cleaner around the mouthpiece to remove any debris lingering on it.Blow through the stem to blow out any ash or debris.

, Take a soft cloth to wipe down your pipe after you have cleaned the inside. To preserve the wood, you may want to use a cloth dampened with olive oil or a special wood pipe cleaning cloth.Place the pipe on the shelf.
If you are concerned about moisture in the stem, you can leave a pipe cleaner in it to soak up moisture.

Clean the mortise.,
Clean the rim of the bowl.,
Polish the band.,
Avoid getting the alcohol on the outside of the pipe.,
Ream the bowl when the cake becomes too thick.",How to Clean a Wood Pipe3," Separate the stem and the bowl. Moisten a pipe cleaner with alcohol, and then run the pipe cleaner through the stem. Make sure to pull it all the way through. After you have pulled the damp pipe cleaner through, run a dry one through.The pipe cleaner will probably have black and brown debris on it. Continue doing this until the pipe cleaner doesn’t have any debris on it when you push it through.
You can use isopropyl alcohol or grain alcohol.
If it is available to you, you can also purchase pipe cleaning solution.

, The airhole should be cleaned with a bristle pipe cleaner that has been dipped in alcohol. Use this pipe cleaner to wipe the airhole, and follow that with a dry regular pipe cleaner.There should be some resistance. If the airhole is too large, then fold the pipe cleaner in half.
Do this until the pipe cleaner you scrub through the airhole comes out without any debris.

, The mortise is the place where the stem connects to the bowl. This can also get dirty, so use a cotton swab or shank brush to do this. Clean it until there is no residual ash or dark residue on the brush or swab., When the rim of the bowl starts to get a dark, ashy look, you should clean it. Take a damp pipe cleaner and wipe around the rim. This gets rid of any charring that begins around the rim from the flame of your lighter.This usually occurs from lighting the pipe.

, Many pipes have metal bands around them. When you do a deep cleaning, polish the band. Use a metal polish to do this. If your band is made of silver, use silver polish., While cleaning the pipe, avoid getting any alcohol on the outside. This will mess up the finish, stain, or detail on the outside. Use care to keep the alcohol on the pipe cleaner.This is also true for any pipe cleaning solution. Keep it away from the outside of the pipe.

, When the cake, the protective layer of ash, gets too thick, you need to ream the bowl. Reaming the bowl means scraping off some of the cake. You can use a reamer, which you can buy at a tobacco shop or online. As you clean the inside of the bowl, make sure to go slowly as you shave the cake. Don’t pull it out in chunks. You can easily damage or scrape the bowl with the edge of the tool.You can also use the blunt knife tool that came with your pipe tools. This can clean the cake in an uneven way or dig into the wood. You can also use wooden dowels that have been wrapped in sandpaper or grit cloth.
The cake should only be about 1/16 in or 1.5 mm in thickness. Anything larger than that should be reamed.

Consider price.,
Consider the number of cigars you'll likely have on hand.,
Make sure the humidor you buy is lined with cedar.,
Select a humidifier for your humidor.,
Purchase a hygrometer and calibrate it.,
Season the humidor to create the microclimate.",How to Store a Cigar2," Humidors are available in many different sizes, styles, and price ranges. You don't need to break the bank to get a good-quality humidor in which you can keep great cigars fresh. Online, or at the cigar store, explore options in your price range.


You should be able to get a handsome glass-top humidor in which you can control the temperature for less than $60 or $70.
Another big cost-difference tends to be temperature and humidity control elements, the quality of which can vary slightly. It would be better to get the smallest-possible humidor for your uses, with the best-quality components.
While good-quality cedar chests are the best and most reliable way to store cigars, it's possible to make your own from household ingredients, if you're less of a stickler for supreme quality. Skip to the next method if you want to make your own humidor.

, There's no sense in investing in a 7-drawer humidor chest that can hold a couple hundred cigars if you only smoke one every now and then. Try to anticipate how many you plan to keep on hand at any given time and get the smallest-appropriate humidor.


Desk-top humidors will hold about 25 cigars, while larger cases can hold upward of 150. Humidors with multiple drawers can offer organization solutions, allowing you to keep full boxes of different varieties of cigar in different areas of the humidor, hundreds of sticks on each. These are the most expensive option, several hundred dollars.
Travel humidors are small, durable, plastic-backed cases that hold 10 or 15 cigars at a time. If you're going on the road and end up collecting a few cigars, or if you just want a small and durable option, a travel humidor can be a cheap alternative to more expensive desktop varieties.

, It's important to buy humidors lined with cedar wood, which helps to regulate the humidity and the airflow in the humidor. Plastic or metal humidors, even with the proper humidifying agents, won't maintain as even and optimal a temperature as a cedar humidor. It looks handsome, smells great, and maintains temperature and humidity.

, Most humidors will come with a humidifier in the case already, but being able to distinguish between the different types and styles of humidification will allow you to make the most informed choice.



Sponge-style humidifiers are the most common humidifiers, and the cheapest. These usually line the lid of the humidor, and are soaked with propylene glycol solution, commonly called ""PG,"" which regulates the humidity in the box.The liquid is commonly sold at cigar retailers, for between $6 and $10 a quart. Xikar and Cigar Mechanic are popular brands for soaking the humidifier.

Humidor beads are made of moisture-sensitive silica, and are extremely long-lasting, easy to use, and can be recharged periodically to maintain the humidity in the humidor. A package of humidor beads costs between $18 and $20, but will likely never need to be replaced, just recharged. To use them, you'll soak them in distilled water and spritz them with distilled water periodically to maintain humidity. Keeping them stored in a new women's stocking is a perfect way to store them in the humidor.

Digital humidifiers are somewhat expensive, but also the most efficient. You can set the electric humidifier to the proper specifications, set it, and forget it.

, A hygrometer is used to measure the humidor's humidity levels, and are available in both analog and digital models, which can be installed in the humidor, or on the outside. Some humidors come with clock-style hygrometers on the front lip of the humidor, for easy access. Digital hygrometers are ready to go out of the box, but analog hygrometers need to be calibrated before use, to make sure they're reading correctly.


To calibrate your hygrometer, close it in a plastic bag with about a tablespoon of salt in a cap for between 6 and 12 hours. When you remove the hygrometer from the bag, it should read 75% humidity. If it doesn't, use a screwdriver to calibrate the back of the hygrometer so it reads 75% and it'll be ready to go.

, Before you load your humidor with cigars, you need to spend about 7 days humidifying the humidor and preparing the optimum microclimate. It's a simple process, but an important one to prime your humidor and give your cigars the best possible home.To season the humidor, prime the humidifier of your choice, either by soaking the humidity beads, the sponge, or setting the digital humidifier, and putting it in place in the humidor.
Pour about a cup of distilled water into a clean cup and place it in the humidor, then blot the walls of the humidor with a very-slightly damp towel. Don't wipe them down, just blot them very gently.
Close the humidor and leave it alone for about seven days, watching the temperature and the humidity levels. At the end of the week, you can remove the glass of water and you should be ready to load up the humidor with cigars.

Find a suitable container.,
Humidify the container.,
Store the container in a cool, dark place.",How to Store a Cigar3," Homemade humidors can be made from plastic bins, old ammo cases, or cigar boxes. While these options may not keep cigars fresh as long as a humidor, they can do the trick for an mid-to-extended amount of time. If you are planning on storing the cigar for more than a week but don't want to buy a humidor, it's a good idea to make one.


After you've selected your container, wash it thoroughly with antibacterial soap and warm water. Let dry completely. The container should be big enough to hold cigars while they're all laying flat.
Make sure the container closes completely, with some air circulation. This will keep the flavor from your cigars from mixing or losing their flavor. If the container is air-tight, make sure to expose your cigars to fresh air every two weeks, at least.

, Just as you would with a store-bought humidor, you need to find some way to keep the air in your homemade version around 70% humidity. Add a jar of Xicar humidifier beads/gel to the container, soaked in distilled water, then drained.


At the very least, a small, very-slightly dampened household sponge in the bottom of the container in the corner of the storage container will work in a pinch. This will ensure that moisture will be available inside the container once its shut. Securely close the lid on your container with the cigars inside.
At a local cigar store, ask if they have any cedar dividers from cigar boxes lying around they wouldn't mind parting with. You can use these to either create cigar tubes to store individual cigars in, or to line the walls of your homemade humidor. This will help regulate the humidity.

, Monitor the temperature of the area you are storing them in and make sure it stays around 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius). Keep a thermometer close by to monitor the temperature, and smoke the cigars as soon as you get the chance.


Check you cigars periodically to make sure they're not suffering from too much humidity, or becoming too dampened or wet. Look for any signs of mold, or beads of dampness in the humidor. Remove the humidifier, or let some air in, if this is occurring.

"
"
Store the humidor at the proper temperature.,
Keep like cigars with like cigars.,
Consider aging quality cigars ""naked."",
Rotate cigars you plan on storing for more than a month.,
Maintain the humidifier depending on the climate.",How to Store a Cigar4," Humidors can only control humidity, which makes it your job to watch the temperature. Humidors should be kept in climate-controlled rooms between 68 and 72 degrees F at all times.

, A common point of confusion and interest for aficionados with a large collection is where to store the different cigars. If you've got 15 Maduros and a variety of other miscellaneous cigars, of various strengths and flavors, can they all age next to each other? Yes and no. Keep natural cigars with natural cigars, and flavored cigars with flavored.


It is possible for flavors to bleed between cigars, but not between all cigars. A good rule of thumb is to definitely separate (remember those cedar dividers at the cigar store?) any flavored cigars you might have, from any natural tobacco cigars. A cognac-flavored stick, for example, can leech onto natural tobacco sticks it shares space with, making everything taste the same. In general, though, natural sticks should stay together, regardless of strength or flavor profile.
If you must store a variety of cigars in the same box in a humidor, or the same humidor next to one another, consider storing them in cedar sleeves, or create your own from old cedar at the cigar store.

, Another debatable topic in the cigar-collecting world is whether or not to store cigars in the cellophane wrapper, or ""naked,"" having been removed from the wrapper. If you've got a quality-humidor that you maintain effectively and want to age a high-quality cigar for a long period of time, it's recommended that you remove the cellophane by some, though it largely has to do with preference.


If you plan on smoking a cigar shortly, in less than a month, it's perfectly fine to leave it in the cellophane wrapper for that length of time, and even longer if you wish. It's just as common to leave cigars in the tubes and wrappers they arrive in, especially cedar-lined wrappers.

, To make sure the air doesn't get stale in your humidor, it's good practice to move cigars around every month or so. If you're an avid smoker and are constantly moving them around because you're taking some out and replacing with others, you probably don't need to schedule rotations, but if you're a collector of fine cigars that you've been aging for a long time, it's best to move them around.


In general, cigars should be stored flat, to promote air circulation. Don't store cigars on top of other cigars. Keep cigars in a humidor with plenty of room for more.

, It's good practice to check your hygrometer at least once a week to make sure the humidity levels are staying steady, and to change the fluid in the humidifier every couple of months, depending on the climate in which you live.


In especially cold and dry climates, it's a good idea to change your humidifier fluid, or recharge the beads every 3 months or so, and certainly any time you see the levels dipping. In more tropical-climates, you're safe changing it every 9 months to a year.
It's a good idea to recalibrate hygrometers once every six months, by removing it from the humidor, storing it in the bag with salt, and checking to make sure it's giving an accurate reading. Faulty hygrometers are responsible for most user-errors in storage.

Rinse and dry the screen.",How to Clean a Pipe Screen," Hold your pipe over a sink. Use a pair of tweezers to gently remove the screen from your pipe.;
, Take a good look at the screen to see if it’s damaged. If it doesn’t have any holes or tears, then it’s probably worth saving. If it has worn very thin or has a hole in it, you should probably just toss it and replace is with a new screen.

, While holding your screen over the sink, gently rock it back and forth with your thumb and forefinger. Blow on it, and if it's now clean, there’s no need to clean the screen. If it’s still looking dirty and clogged, then it’s time to start cleaning.

, You’ll need to gather some supplies, including a lighter or matches, salt, rubbing alcohol, clean water, and a small bowl or container. These supplies will help you clean your pipe screen effectively., While holding it with tweezers horizontally over the sink, hold a lighter or match underneath the screen in your other hand. Slowly move the flame around the different parts of the screen to burn it evenly.


If it catches fire, extinguish the match or lighter and let the screen fire burn out.
If it doesn't catch, burn the screen for no more than 5 seconds.

, Remove or extinguish the flame and continue holding the screen with your tweezers for at least one minute. After a minute or more, hold the back of your hand close to the screen to see if it’s still hot. Once it’s cool, take it from the tweezers and hold each end of the screen between your thumb and forefinger.

, Gently rock the screen again, letting any ashes dislodge. While still holding it over the sink, blow on it again to get any remaining ashes off.

, Look carefully at the screen once more to see whether it’s clean or still looks clogged and covered in dirt. If it’s good to go, you can put it back in your pipe. If not, you’ll need to soak the screen.

, If your pipe screen is still caked with dirt, ash, and debris, it’s time to soak it. Pour some rubbing alcohol in a bowl, cup, or similar container. Add in a few tablespoons of salt and mix with a spoon., Place your screen into the mixture and let it sit there for a half hour or so. This will give the mixture some time to break down the dirt, ash, and resin.

This is also a great way to clean the pipe itself, if it’s made of glass. Soak your entire pipe in the container if you’d like., After at least half an hour has gone by, take the screen out of the mixture, rinse it thoroughly under clean running water, and then wipe it clean with a paper towel.

If you’re cleaning the entire pipe, make sure to thoroughly rinse it with clean water and wipe it dry with a paper towel as well.

Support your scrotum.,
Try to be patient.,
Avoid taking blood-thinning medications for a few days.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Refrain from all types of sexual activity for seven days.,
Do not swim or bathe for 24 to 48 hours after your vasectomy.",How to Recover From a Vasectomy," After surgery, you will probably have some pain and swelling in your scrotum. You may also notice some fluid leaking from the incision site after surgery. This is entirely normal and should improve and resolve itself within a few days. Use gauze and/or bandages as needed and as recommended by your doctor.Look at your scrotum with a hand mirror once or twice per day to see how it is healing. If swelling is continuing to get worse, or you notice significant redness or bruising that does not improve, see your doctor for further evaluation.
Keep in mind that healing often proceeds without complications and you should see your scrotum beginning to look normal again after a few days.;
, Normally an over-the-counter pain medication such as Tylenol (acetaminophen) will suffice. If you require stronger medication to control your pain, book another appointment with your physician and he or she can write you a prescription for stronger pain medications. However, most men are fine with over-the-counter medications and do not need to opt for anything stronger.


Avoid Ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) and Aspirin for pain control as these can negatively impact healing of your vasectomy.

, For the first two days after the procedure, ice the scrotum area for 20 minutes every hour or so. After that, use ice as needed to help with pain and swelling.Icing helps to diminish inflammation in the scrotum area and also reduces swelling. It can therefore be helpful in reducing symptoms of pain and discomfort.
When started early after the vasectomy procedure is done, it can also help to speed the recovery process.

, Leave on the bandage that your doctor placed on your scrotum for a period of 24 to 48 hours following the surgery.Wearing tight-fitting underwear or a jockstrap is a good idea as well, as it can help to alleviate discomfort and also to protect the area.

, After a week has passed, most of the bothersome symptoms, such as swelling and pain, should be resolved. Call your doctor immediately if your symptoms persist, or if you notice any signs of complications such as an infection.


Symptoms that are typically associated with a post-operative infection include fever, blood or pus coming out of the surgical site, and/or worsening pain and swelling.Other complications to be aware of include continued bleeding beyond 48 hours after surgery (or formation of a large bruise, called a ""hematoma,"" on the scrotum); something called a ""sperm granuloma"" (which is basically a harmless mass that forms in the testicles as a sort of immune response); and/or persistent pain., You should not take any blood thinning medications for at least a few days following your vasectomy. Be sure to ask your doctor for specific advice on this if you are taking blood-thinning medications. This is because taking blood-thinning medications may increase your risk of post-operative bleeding.


Know that the duration of time to be off your blood-thinning medications varies from person to person (depending on the reason you are taking them in the first place). Ask your doctor when you can resume your normal medications.

, One of the most important components of recovering from your vasectomy is rest. You may need to take a few days off of work or cut back on your usual activities to facilitate healing. Unless your work is strenuous or requires heavy lifting, you should be able to go back quite quickly, such as within two to three days.If your job requires heavy lifting, talk to your doctor about when it will be safe for you to return.


Try not to do too much for the first two to three days following the procedure, and don't be afraid to ask others to help you out so that you can relax and recover.
Keep your activity level to a minimum after your vasectomy. It is advisable to limit physical activities for about five days post-surgery, and to refrain from heavy lifting for at least a week. Heavy lifting strains the area and therefore interferes with healing. After five days, you may resume exercise, starting out easy and getting back to your normal routine after a couple of weeks.

, Ejaculation can be painful and sometimes lead to bleeding in the initial stages after your vasectomy. Therefore, you will not be able to engage in any sexual activity about seven days after your vasectomy.When you do choose to resume sexual activity (after a week has passed and you feel comfortable enough to do so), remember that you will need to use birth control until you have had follow-up tests with your doctor confirming that your sperm count is zero. It usually takes 20 ejaculations after the surgery for residual sperm to be fully cleared.
Overall a vasectomy results in no changes to a man's sexual function. Many men are concerned it could affect desire, erections, and/or the sensation of orgasm; however, studies have been done to confirm that none of these are negatively affected by the procedure. Studies have shown that women's sexual satisfaction has increased after their partner has had a vasectomy. This may be due to greater confidence that there will not be an unwanted pregnancy.
Note that there is also a very small risk (0.1% per year) of becoming pregnant even after you have had a vasectomy. This is because, even though the two ends of the vas deferens have been ""disconnected"" from one another, there is still a tiny chance that sperm could pass through and result in pregnancy. The chance is so low, however, that a vasectomy (or a ""tubal ligation,"" which is the comparable procedure in women) is still considered the most effective form of birth control for those couples who have decided they do not want to have any more children.

, Depending on the technique that your doctor used, you may have stitches in your scrotum. To prevent an infection from developing, it is best to keep the stitches dry by not bathing or swimming for the first couple of days.Ask your doctor when it is okay to start bathing and/or swimming again.

Know how tobacco or marijuana affect you.,
Avoid smoking before work or school.,
Keep fire safety in mind.",How to Build a Disposable Ciga Bong," The bottle you use for your ciga bomb should be should be a fairly small size. Something like a 2 liter bottle will be cumbersome to handle, but something too small will not light properly. A bottle around 16 ounces is usually in the right range., Once you've found the right bottle, make sure it's free of any residue. Soda bottles especially may be sticky on the bottom. Rinse the bottle out several times before you begin to build your ciga bomb.It's best to use a water bottle, as they're usually easy to simply empty out. It may be hard to clean out a soda bottle.

, You will need some aluminum foil to make your ciga bong. You need to prepare the foil to make sure it's strong enough for the ciga bong.Fold the foil over once. This will make it stronger.
Cut the folded foil into a square that's 2.5 by 2.5 inches. This will make it the right size to fill the top of your bottle. Later, you will smoke out of the foil.

, If the bottle has a cap on, make sure to remove it before applying the foil. Place your square over the top of the bottle. You will be creating a small bowl, where you will place marijuana or tobacco when you use your bowl.Slowly, push the foil down slightly into the bottle. Use your thumbs to form a small, round bowl. Be gentle. You don't want to end up tearing the foil.
Make sure your bowl is deep enough that tobacco or marijuana will not spill out and make a mess. Wrap the foil sticking out of the top of the bowl around the sides of the bottle's opening. This will secure the bowl in place.

, Once the bowl is securely in place, you need to make a series of small holes in it. This allows the tobacco or marijuana to light up when you smoke. Use a needle or a pin to make holes.You do not want large holes. You just need a series of holes the size of a pin prick. Avoid making the holes too far apart, as this could cause the foil to rip.
Work slowly and be gentle. You do not want to tear your foil.

, You can use a pair of scissors or an x-acto knife. If you choose to use an x-acto knife, be careful. The blade will be very sharp. Make the hole on the opposite side of hand you'll use to hold the bottle. For example, if you hold the bottle with your right hand, make the hole on the left side.Use your needle or pin to get the hole started. If you use the scissors or x-acto knife right away, you may accidentally rip the bottle. Make a very small hole using a pin or needle.
Use your scissors to gently twist the hole to make it a bit wider. The hole's diameter should be about once inch.

, Now, you can use your bong. Pack the tobacco or the marijuana in the tinfoil bowl on top of the bottle. Place your mouth over the hole. Light the tobacco or marijuana and inhale.The smoke will be drawn though the bottle and then pass through the hole. You will inhale the smoke trapped in the bottle.
If you have trouble inhaling the smoke, make the mouth hole slightly bigger.

, You want to make sure you know how you respond to tobacco or marijuana. If you've never smoked before, avoid doing so alone. Only smoke a little at first. Never operate machinery or drive a car when smoking marijuana.Marijuana is illegal in most US states. You should only smoke marijuana if you do so for medical purposes or if it's legal in your state.

, As marijuana can impair your sense of judgment and memory, avoid smoking in situations where you have to pay attention. You should not smoke before you have to go to work or school.If you are a medical patient, you may not always smoke with the intent of creating an altered state of consciousness. In these cases, it may be safe to smoke before work or school if you know how you respond to marijuana.

, For both tobacco and marijuana, there is always a fire risk. You should make sure to reduce the risk of a fire if you choose to smoke.Never smoke in bed.
Be very careful when smoking while also drinking alcohol. You may be more likely to drop a lighter or your ciga bomb if you're under the influence of alcohol.
If you empty your bowl, make sure it is not still burning. You should also pour water in the garbage can as an extra precaution.

Soak the pipe for several hours and repeat in the morning to clean very dirty pipes.,
Rinse out the pipe with hot water.,
Clean out any remaining spots with a pipe cleaner or cotton swabs.",How to Clean a Glass Pipe1," Hold the pipe upside down and gently tap to remove any remaining particles. Then use a pipe cleaner, cotton swab, mechanical pencil, needle, or similarly thin object to remove any large, easily dislodged bits of resin you can reach.


Don't risk breaking the pipe to get at tough spots, as you only need to get anything big and easy to reach off now. This will help the alcohol clean the rest of the pipe faster.;
, Try and purchase 90% isopropyl, as it will clean the pipe faster than the more watered-down 71% solution. Place the pipe inside, making sure it is fully submerged in the fluid.


Alcohol breaks down tar and resin, making it easier to remove and cleaning off stains over time., Salt will act like an abrasive sponge on your pipe, scrubbing away the resin in places you could never reach with a sponge or brush. Because it is meant to rub away the resin, try and use the biggest grains of salt your can find -- course or kosher salt is usually your best bet.

, If possible, get the salt in the pipe and then use your fingers to close off the openings to the pipe. You can then shake up the salt inside the chamber, getting rid of as much resin as possible. Shake the bag for 1-2 minutes or until the pipe is visibly clean., Add a splash of fresh isopropyl and let the pipe sit, submerged in the fluid, for several hours before shaking it up again. If you are using 71% isopropyl alcohol, then some of your salt may have dissolved, so be sure to add more if you seem to be missing some.

, Remove all the alcohol and salt from the pipe with some piping hot water and discard the rest down the toilet, as it can stink up your sink and pipes if left undisturbed., Wipe off any little spots, dipping the end of your tool in some clean alcohol to get rid of any persistent stains. To remove any water marks or non-resin stains, soak the pipe for 10-15 minutes in a mixture of warm water and lemon juice."

A simmer is when there is a constant, but not extreme, cascade of bubbles breaking the surface of the water., Make sure that the pipe is fully submerged in water. As it boils, the water will evaporate, so keep your eye on it so ensure your pipe doesn't end up alone in a hot pan, which may crack it.

, Remove pot from heat, drain out the water, and inspect the pipe to check for any excess residue. The pipe will be extremely hot, so use an oven mitt and extreme care to check it. Never douse the hot glass in cold water -- this will cause it to shatter.


You may need to repeat this process with a fresh pot of clean water until the pipe is thoroughly cleaned.

, Take a cotton swab or pipe cleaner and wipe away any lingering residue. If there are water stains, soak your pipe for a few minutes in a mixture of lemon juice and 2–3 tablespoons (29.6–44.4 ml) of clean water and then let it air dry.

Try using denture cleaning tablets.,
Purchase specialty cleaning solutions.,
Freeze the pipe to remove hard buildups.,
Clean your pipe regularly.",How to Clean a Glass Pipe3," Put your pipe the bottom of a Tupperware container and fill it up with enough hot water to cover the top. Drop in 2-3 denture tablets and let it sit and soak for a half hour. The fizzing will remove a lot of resin, and the formula is designed to remove stains and residue.Other alternate home cleaning solutions include:


Salt and vinegar.
Baking soda and vinegar.
Sand and water.

, Marketed specifically to smokers, products like Simple Green and Formula 420 are made to clean the resins in glass pipes. They are, however, a bit more expensive than the simple DIY solutions, and many people do not find them any more effective. That said, they eliminate the need for shaking or messes, as they often remove the resin through simple soaking., Freezing causes the resin to harden and dry up, making it easier to dislodge. Freeze the pipe for 30 minutes to an hour, then quickly use a needle or similarly sharp, thin object to knock off the resin. It will not take long for the resin to warm up and become gummy again, so you need to work quickly.

, A quick rinse and a soak in some isopropyl, done once a week, takes only 5 minutes. But it will keep you from having to resort to deep cleanings or overnight soakings, and keep your piece shiny and sparkling. Some stains will not come out if they soak into the glass, but this only happens if you neglect cleaning for several months or years in a row. Take the time now to clean it off and your task will be much easier in the future."

Identify the symptoms of early prostate cancer.,
Pay attention to your urination cycles.,
Be aware of burning when you urinate.,
Look for blood in your urine or a pink/red urine tint.,
Pay attention to painful ejaculations (orgasm).",How to Recognize Prostate Cancer Symptoms1," Document any symptoms you notice, so that you can tell your doctor about them. These symptoms are not definitive proof that you have prostate cancer, but they should be a signal to you that you need to get screened by a doctor.;
, Changes in urination cycles — both drastic and gradual — may indicate prostate cancer. Due to its location, the mass from cancer can push up against your urethra or bladder, preventing normal flow of urine. This is called a weak or slow flow. Note if it takes you longer to complete urinating or if the urine is slow/dribbling from your penis. Other changes to watch for include:


Wanting to go to the bathroom but no urine comes out. The mass from the prostate may have blocked off the urethra or bladder opening to the urethra. If you feel you have to go but nothing comes out the penis or very small dribbling of urine, you may have a more severe blockage of the urethra/bladder.
Having the urge to urinate more at night or waking up with the feeling. Since the mass obstructs urine outlet, your bladder may not empty entirely during the day. So when you are sleeping the bladder it fills up faster due to the urine previously there.You may also get the sense you want to urinate but you cannot due to the mass blocking the urethra/bladder.
You can check other changes in your urination cycle against a questionnaire that is used by urologist and primary care doctors, located here: http://www.urospec.com/uro/Forms/ipss.pdf


, Due to more urine collecting within the bladder and/or urethra from incomplete voiding, infections can arise causing inflammation. When urine passes through it irritates and causes a burning pain through the urethra. When the prostate is inflamed from an infection, this is called prostatitis.

, Due to the enlarging mass from prostate cancer new blood vessels may form and many others may get injured. Also, enlargement of the prostate may lead to prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) and increase urinary tract infections which can cause blood in the urine.Blood in urine is known as hematuria.

, It is well-documented that there may be an association of prostate cancer with prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate from infection).When this occurs the inflammation of the prostate can irritate the gland upon ejaculation causing painful orgasms."
"
Look for symptoms of advanced prostate cancer or metastasis (spread of cancer to other locations).,
Pay attention to unexplained nausea, vomiting, constipation, and confusion.,
Be aware that swollen extremities (arms or legs) or weakness in the legs, arms, or hips bones can be a sign of prostate cancer.,
Pay attention to unexplained shortness of breath, chest pain, and/or coughing up blood.,
Watch for a combination of symptoms that may indicate prostate cancer.,
Pay attention to back pain and tenderness to touch.,
Watch for bleeding from the rectum while going to the bathroom.,
Understand that symptoms associated with prostate cancer could be symptoms of a different illness.,
Be aware that there may be no symptoms present with prostate cancer.",How to Recognize Prostate Cancer Symptoms2," Urinary tract infections, BPH, and prostatitis will not present with metastatic signs of cancer. There are a variety of symptoms that can go along with advanced prostate cancer. You should keep an eye out for these if you are at risk of prostate cancer or have had it in the past.

, Prostate cancer can attach to bone causing a deep bone pain, weakness, and eventually broken bones. The calcium from the bone can empty in the blood leading to increased levels causing nausea, vomiting, constipation and confusion., Prostate cancer can spread to the lymph nodes. These nodes are located throughout the body including around the pelvic area. They help filter and empty out fluid into the blood. When these become blocked by cancer tissue they will enlarge and cause swelling of the area. Look for swelling in your extremities such as the legs or arms. If you think one side is affected compare it to the other side., Prostate cancer can spread to the lungs. Look for a cough that cannot be treated with over-the-counter remedies or antibiotics, chest pain that may be throughout or isolated to an area, shortness of breath and coughing up blood. The cancer interrupts normal lung functioning, leading to damage and inflammation of the tissue and arteries. Inflammation will lead to fluid accumulation within the lining of the lungs (pleural effusion) and can cause shortness of breath and aching chest pain., Difficulty walking, headaches, sensation loss on certain parts of my body, memory loss, and trouble holding urine — when experienced together — can be signs of advanced cancer. The most common cancer spread to the brain from the prostate is called Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.It can present with headaches, sensation loss on the body, difficulty walking, unable to hold urine (incontinence), and memory difficulties., Prostate cancer can spread to the spinal cord. This can lead to compression of the spinal column causing back pain, tenderness and muscle weakness with or without sensation loss. Neurological problems may arise such as urinary retention or, less frequently, bladder or bowel incontinence., This can be a sign that cancer has spread to the rectum. Case studies have documented prostate cancer can spread to the rectum due to its close proximity. Look for bleeding and/or abdominal pain from the rectum when passing stool., For example, a urinary tract infection may present with burning on urination and fever but will not have any of the other symptoms of prostate cancer. In either case, whether the burning and fever are symptoms of prostate cancer or a urinary tract infection, you should see your doctor. Best practice is to seek expert medical advice and perform the routine exams and tests for a proper diagnosis.


Prostatitis may present with the same symptoms as prostate cancer but tends to be more painful in the lower abdomen, lower back, and pelvic region. Prostatitis may be due to an infection and can present with a fever where cancer does not.
Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) can mimic prostate cancer symptoms to the point where only diagnostic test and examination will help rule cancer out. Though, BPH most commonly present with lower urinary tract symptoms such as urgency to urinate, weak urine stream, waking up at night to go to the bathroom (nocturia) and straining to void urine.Also, almost 50% of men aged 50 to 80 may experience erection or ejaculation difficulties.Nocturia (nighttime urination) is common as you age. The bladder loses elasticity and its ability to hold more urine the older you get. In addition, our bodies make less hormones over time, which slows down our kidney function at night causing more urine production than normal. This combination leads to frequent waking up and nighttime urination as well as more urination during the day.BPH and prostate cancer can cause nocturia but will normally present with weak stream of urine, lack of urination, burning sensation in penis from urinating, painful ejaculation and trouble getting an erection.
Frequent daytime and nighttime urination can also be a symptom of diabetes (high blood sugar), which can also have serious complications. It is advised to seek medical advice from your doctor if you experience excessive nighttime and daytime urination. Keep a voiding diary, this is a two-day record of how much you drink, how often you have to go the bathroom and the urine output, any medications you are taking, any urinary tract infections, and any related symptoms. Your doctor will review the diary in order to determine the possible cause(s) of and treatment for the nocturia., Many men with prostate cancer often have no symptoms at all. If you are at risk of prostate cancer, then it is a good idea to get checked on a regular basis, whether you have symptoms or not.

Visit your doctor.,
Know how your doctor will diagnose prostate cancer.,
Be aware that your doctor may order other tests if they suspect a different diagnosis.",How to Recognize Prostate Cancer Symptoms3," It is advised to seek medical advice if you have any of the symptoms of prostate cancer. There are many other possible diagnoses, such as prostatitis, urinary tract infection, and benign prostatic hyperplasia, that can mimic cancer but it is best to rule out prostate cancer as soon as possible. Your doctor will take a detailed history and physical examination to order the appropriate workup, and will ask about your symptoms, family history, diet, sexual history, and the use of any substances such as drugs or tobacco.

, While you can tell your doctor about your symptoms, a clear diagnosis can only be done with specific medical tests. If cancer is probable or needs to be investigated, your doctor can perform a variety of screening exams or tests:Digital rectal examination (DRE). Your doctor will feel for your prostate with a gloved and lubricated index finger through your rectum. The doctor will then palpate the part of your rectum facing your belly button; the prostate lies above/in front. The doctor is feeling for any irregular shapes (lumps and bumps), contour (smooth or not smooth), size and tenderness. Abnormal findings include firm, bumpy, nonsmooth, and enlarged prostate. Normal DRE does not rule out prostate cancer unfortunately.
Prostate specific antigen (PSA) blood test. Your doctor will insert a needle in your arm and collect blood and send it out for detection of PSA. This is a specific protein found in your prostate. Most doctors conclude a level of 4ng/ml or lower is considered normal. Men with a PSA level between four and 10 have about a one in four chance of having prostate cancer. If the PSA is more than 10, the chance of having prostate cancer is over 50% (10). PSA levels cause false positive or false negative results. Elevated levels may not indicate prostate cancer or issues — it serves as a guide. Normal levels do not indicate you don't have cancer. Ejaculation (recent sexual activity), prostate infection, digital rectal examination and bike riding (this puts pressure on the prostate) can cause elevations of PSA. Those without prostate symptoms and elevated PSA may require repeat testing after two days. Repeat elevated PSA levels may warrant a DRE and/or biopsy of the prostate (needle inserted to take a piece of the prostate tissue for analysis) if symptoms are present. Cancer can occur even with normal results from the PSA test.
TransRectal Ultrasound (TRUS). A small lubricated probe will be inserted into the rectum and emit sound waves that can produce a picture on the screen. What the doctor is looking for is enlarged size, abnormal shape and contour. This method cannot always tell the difference between normal and prostate cancer.
Biopsy. This involves using a TRUS to guide a needle into the prostate gland and take a sample of the tissue for analysis. Your doctor will sample more than one area of the prostate for analysis. This is a definitive test for both BPH and prostate cancer. Your doctor may elect to undergo this if there is high level of suspicion but previous studies have come back negative/normal. A pathologist will use a Gleason grading system to analyze the tissue biopsy of the prostate. A grade from one to five can be assigned with five being cancer cells present and one being normal tissue present. If cancer is present, most biopsies are grade three or higher, and grades one and two are not often used.

, For example, your doctor may order a urinalysis if they suspect a urinary tract infection. Analysis of the urine will show high white blood cells (immunity cells) and possibly nitrites if a bacterial infection is present.


Benign prostatic hyperplasia — The same tests and exams will be done to determine BPH as in prostate cancer with many of the results possibly overlapping; however, the biopsy will not show cancer cells.
Prostatitis — The prostate will be tender upon DRE unlike in cancer.

Learn about the prostate.,
Understand how prostate cancer develops.,
Know the risk factors for prostate cancer.",How to Recognize Prostate Cancer Symptoms4," The prostate is a gland located below the bladder and in front of the rectum in males. It starts off as the size of a walnut in young men but then grows gradually as they age. The prostate function is to make some of the fluid that nourishes our sperm cells that make up male semen. The urethra, the duct we urinate through and males ejaculate from, passes through the prostate on the way from the bladder., Prostate cancer is a malignant tumor of the prostate. When cancer emerges, the prostate cells grow too rapidly (malignant cells) and cause a mass to form within the prostate gland. Because of its location, the bladder, urethra and muscles around the area are affected. Prostate cancer has several stages:Early prostate cancer is also known as localized prostate cancer. The cancer is contained within the prostate, and can even be present for years without causing any problems.
At the advanced prostate cancer stage, the cancer has spread beyond the prostate and has entered other parts of the body and tissues. Prostate cancer can spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and to other parts of the body through the bloodstream, such as the lungs and bones., Some risk factors, such as those related to lifestyle, you can control; however, most of the risk factors you cannot control. While you can't control them, it is good to know that you may be at higher risk. Risk factors for prostate cancer include:


Age. Can happen at young or older ages but the risk is minimal in those younger than 40. Risk drastically increases after age 50. 6 out of 10 cases of cancer occur after age 65.
Race/Ethnicity. Though the reasons are still not clear, prostate cancer occurs more often in African-American men than in white men. African American men are more likely to get prostate cancer in their lifetime and twice as more likely to die from it.
Geography. Though not clear but cultural diets and environment may be factors, North America, northwestern Europe, Australia, and the Caribbean islands are at higher risk than those in Asia, Africa, Central America, and South America.
Genetics. A father or brother with prostate cancer more than doubles a man’s risk. Those with several affected relatives, particularly if they were young, are even more at risk.
Diet. Men who eat a lot of red meat or high-fat dairy products appear to have a slightly higher chance of getting prostate cancer. These men also tend to eat fewer fruits and vegetables. Doctors aren’t sure which of these factors is responsible for raising the risk.Obesity. Some studies, not all, have found an association with prostate cancer and increasing body mass index.The link was greater with higher grade or advanced cancers. A recent study also found that obesity in African-American men leads to increased risk of both low grade and high grade prostate cancer.Smoking. Many studies have found that tobacco smoking increases the rate of prostate cancer.Though, according to the American Cancer Society some studies show no link. Some research has linked smoking to a possible small increase in the risk of death from prostate cancer, but this finding will need to be confirmed by other studies.Inflammation of prostate (prostatitis). Studies have found links with prostatitis and prostate cancer but the link is not yet clear or definitive. In addition many tissue samples from prostate cancers show inflammation upon microscopy."

Separate all the moving pieces from the bong.,
Rinse out the pieces in hot water.,
Knock off any big pieces of resin with cotton swabs or pipe cleaners.,
Place the smaller parts in resealable plastic bags.",How to Clean a Glass Bong1," Proper cleaning usually involves shaking and some scrubbing, which can damage delicate glass parts if you're not careful. Separate each of the parts -- the bong, the slide, and the stem, and set them aside to be cleaned separately.

You may want to wear latex gloves, as the smell of resin can be hard to remove from your hands.;
, This will loosen up any of the bigger chunks of resin that may be clogging up your bong. The hotter the water the better, so use tongs to grip the piece if you can't securely hold the piece.

Do not use hot water on a cold piece, as this can cause it to shatter. If your piece is cold, for whatever reason, start with lukewarm water and slowly raise the temperature.

For smaller, routine cleanings, you can just rinse out the bong quickly and move on to further cleaning.


, If there are any large chunks of tar or resin that you can easily reach, simply knock them off with gentle scrubbing. If a chunk resists, that's fine. You just want to get rid of the big, easily removed chunks now.

For smaller pieces with tough, thick stains, like your slide or bowl, it can help to freeze the piece for 30 minutes. This loosens up chunks of resin and makes them easier to knock off. Be sure to dry the bowl before freezing.


, Make sure that they can seal effectively. You'll use the bag to contain your cleaning fluid while you soak the smaller pieces. Though you can do them at the same time, it is safest to put them each in separate bags.

You can also use cups and bowls, as long as you can fill them with enough liquid to cover the pieces. However, cleaning may leave an unsavory smell to the cookware, making plastic bags the most convenient option more often than not.

Run some water through the tube.,
Allow the entire pipe to dry off.",How to Clean a Bowl or Chillum1," Use a toothpick or similar implement, such as a paperclip. Tap the debris out after each pass.;
, A pipe cleaner (a Q-Tips also works well) has small bristles attached to a bendable rod, making it easier to get through the nooks and crannies of various pipes.

, If you cup your hand around the faucet and the bowl (or mouthpiece), it will increase the pressure along with the speed of the water flowing through it.

,,, Isopropyl alcohol, or rubbing alcohol, is a solvent, meaning that is dissolves other compounds. And as far as other solvents are concern, rubbing alcohol is relatively safe and evaporates quickly.

, Make sure there isn't any remaining alcohol left in the pipe.

, Wipe off the outside of the pipe and place it somewhere to air-dry, preferably where there is sunlight.

Rinse it thoroughly with water.,
Clean off remaining residue.,
Repeat as necessary.",How to Clean a Pipe2," Epsom salt is good but table salt works too.








, This container should be as close as possible to the size of the pipe. It should also need to be fairly sturdy (not made of super cheap plastic) because you will be putting harsh chemicals or very hot water into it.








, Now, which cleaning solution you should use is a matter of debate. Rubbing alcohol works great but it can destroy the colors of your pipe or possibly leave unhealthy residues. Alternatively you can use vinegar or Listerine and mix it with very hot water. Whatever you use, pour the mix into the container.








, Swish it around and let it soak for at least five minutes.








, Take it out of the cleaning solution and rinse it really thoroughly with hot water. Be careful not to drop your pipe while rinsing.








, Use pipe cleaners, Q-tips, and paper towels to remove any remaining residue.

Fill your plastic bags with isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol.,
Add roughly 1-2 tablespoon of salt to the bags.,
Shake the pieces in the bags, trying to get the salt inside the pieces when possible.,
Soak the pipe for several hours and repeat to remove persistent stains.,
Rinse out the pieces with hot water.,
Use water and lemon juice to remove any water stains.",How to Clean a Glass Bong2," Purchase 90% isopropyl instead of 71% whenever available, though both will work. They can be found in the first aid section of your supermarket or pharmacy. Make sure the pieces are fully submerged in the fluid. Alcohol reacts with the tar and resin, making it easier to remove, making it a cheap and effective home cleaner. If you don't have iso alcohol available, there are several alternatives:

Professional cleaners like Simple Green and Solution 420.

Hot water and denture tablets., The bigger the grains of salt the better. Salt won't dissolve in the alcohol, and is used as abrasive. As you shake the bag of salt and alcohol, the salt will get into to nooks and crannies your couldn't reach, scrubbing them off.
, Get the salt in the pipe and then use your fingers to close off the openings to the pipe. Then shake up the salt to get rid of as much resin as you can. Shake the bag for 1-2 minutes or until the piece is visibly clean., If there are parts that are still stuck on firmly, just add a splash of fresh alcohol and let it sit for a few hours. When you return, shake it up again for a deeper clean.

You can remove the piece and use a cotton swap to wipe away any stains, which should come off easily, before soaking the piece again.

Some of the salt has likely dissolved since the other 9% of the isopropyl is water. Add more if you need. 


, Flush out the alcohol and salt with some hot water. You might want to discard the fluid down the toilet, as it can stink up your sink and pipes if left undisturbed., Wipe off any excess spots, dipping the end of your tool in some clean alcohol to get rid of any persistent stains. Then, to remove any water marks, soak the pipe for 10-15 minutes in a mixture of warm water and lemon juice. Dry the piece thoroughly when done for a shop-level shine."
"
Fill the bong with the roughly one cup of rubbing alcohol.,
Add 2-3 tablespoons of large-grain salt.,
Seal up the openings to the bong with your hands.,
Shake the bong to ""scrub"" it with the salt.,
Soak the bong in the alcohol or cleaning products if you have difficult or hard to scrub stains.,
Give the bong a nice shine with some water and lemon juice.",How to Clean a Glass Bong3," This is for a roughly 112{\displaystyle 1{\frac {1}{2}}}ft bong, so adjust accordingly if yours is bigger or smaller. Like with the smaller pieces, 91% isopropyl is the best option, but you can use professional cleaning products like Simple Green as well. If you have separate percolators or sections, add an extra 1/3 cup or so to each percolator.

If you're eyeballing your measurements, simply add as much alcohol, and in all the same places, as you would add water if you were smoking.


, You can use fine-grained table salt, but course salt will work better every time. Again add it to every section of the bong, percolators and all, where you added alcohol.

Don't worry if you can't get the salt everywhere just yet -- it will be easier when you start shaking.


, Use your palms and fingers to seal off the openings to the bong, holding it tightly as well. You can hold down old towels as well to prevent water from seeping out. However, you must have a firm grasp of the bong as well. You'll need to shake it vigorously to clean it, so you must be able to hold on without dropping it.
, The alcohol will loosen the resin and make it easier to remove. The salt will act as a sponge, wiping away the rest of the resin where you can't reach it.

For a deep clean, you may have to rotate and turn the bong in order to get the salt to hard to reach areas.


, If you haven't cleaned your bong after months of use, you may need to let it soak. This is often where cleaning solutions like Solution 420 come in handy, as they are meant to mix with water and left for longer periods of time. Soak the bong overnight and, when done, re-clean it with salt and isopropyl alcohol.
, Use a cotton swab or pipe cleaner to remove any last little stains. To get rid of any water marks, soak the piece for 10-15 minutes warm water and 1/2 a lemon's worth of juice, or 1/2 a cup of white vinegar. When done, make sure you dry the piece thoroughly."

Use the boiling water method only on glass bowls.,
Pick a cooking pot that you don't normally cook with.,
Fill your pot halfway full with warm water and place the bowl or pipe inside.,
Turn your burner on to medium and allow the water to boil.,
After 10 minutes, take the pot off the burner and discard the water.,
Fill the pot up with water again and bring to a boil again.,
Allow the pipe to cool down sufficiently after it is fully cleaned.

,
Take care when using boiling water clean a pipe or bowl.",How to Clean a Bowl or Chillum2," Boiling a wooden, clay, or plastic bowl or chillum could result in deformation or discoloration. Be sure that your bowl is glass before proceeding with this method.

, If the resin or plant matter on your pipe gets stuck on the pot, it could be hard to remove. Choose a pot that you wouldn't mind losing, just to be safe.

,


You don't want to risk breaking the pipe or bowl by dropping it into the boiling water and accidentally shattering it.

, Leave for 5 to 10 minutes.

, You don't want the water to get increasingly dirty or resinous. Be sure that the pipe or bowl is secure when you discard the old water.

, Allow to stand for 5 to 10 minutes. Repeat the discarding and refilling process as necessary, one or two more times.

,,


Always handle the pipe itself with caution, especially after it has come from boiling water. Glass conducts heat very well, meaning that it's likely to be very hot.
Be careful when you discard old water and refill the pot. To stay on the safe side, temporarily remove the pipe or bowl with tongs and then place it back in the pot when the water has been changed.

Pour out old bong water and remove any spent herb. Then give it a good rinse with warm water to remove any remaining solid particles. Finally, fill the bong part way with some of the warm water you’re using., Take it apart so that the individual pieces can be cleaned. Remove all movable parts, including the pipe and mouthpiece. As you take your bong apart, check for any damage such as chips or cracks. You’ll need to replace any damaged pieces before using your bong again., Next, you’ll need to add an abrasive and a cleaner into the base of the bong so that they can work together to clean the inside. Coarse salt and isopropyl alcohol typically work best for this, but you can also use vinegar and rice or baking soda.Alternatively, you can use something like Formula 420, in which case skip the salt. Pour it in and proceed as normal.

, Use your hands, fingers, and thumbs to plug or block the open holes of the bong so that your abrasive and cleaner don’t cause a big mess. Shake it for about five minutes to get the best possible result., Empty the cleaning solution into a sink and rinse it out completely with clean water. Repeat the cleaning process as many times as you need to, but once is usually enough."
"
Presoak your bong in warm water and dish soap.,
Soak small pieces in plastic bags.,
Use a cotton swab or pipe cleaner.,
Get rid of water stains with lemon juice.",How to Clean a Bong2," If your bong is especially dirty, it might be best to soak it in a sink, basin, or bathtub full of warm water and just a squirt of dish soap. Let your bong soak for about an hour or two before you start the cleaning process.Be very conservative with the dish soap. If you use too much, your bong might produce an unpleasant soapy aftertaste the next several times you smoke.

, Put all of the small pieces of your bong into resealable bags with about a tablespoon of coarse salt. Fill the resealable bag with enough rubbing alcohol to completely submerge the pieces. Shake the bags for a few seconds and then let the pieces soak for several minutes. Then, rinse them off with clean water., Use either plastic cotton swabs or pipe cleaners to scrub around the nooks and crannies of your bong, where resin and water stains are harder to reach and remove. Dip them in a little bit of rubbing alcohol before scrubbing., To easily remove water stains in your bong, put some warm water and lemon juice in the base and swish it around. Then, rinse your bong out with cold water."

Use filtered water in your bong.,
Change out the water in your bong daily.,
Clean your bong once a week.,
Store your bong in a bong bag or hard case.",How to Clean a Bong3," The minerals in tap water and unfiltered spring water can cause water stains to form in your bong. To prevent this, always use filtered water when you smoke. It’s also a good idea to use filtered water when cleaning your bong, or at least rinse it with filtered water after cleaning., If you change out your bong water each day, your bong will stay much cleaner. When old water sits in your bong, mold can form. This is pretty gross on its own, but mold also means mold stains, which can make cleaning your bong a more extensive process., This is another way to keep mold from forming and ultimately avoid getting mold stains. Try to do at least a brief cleaning weekly to keep your bong squeaky clean., Since your bong is made of glass, it’s susceptible to cracking and breaking if you aren’t careful. When storing and traveling with your bong, consider keeping it in a protective bag or case to keep anything from happening to it."

Lycopene is what makes fruit and vegetables red, and has been proven as a cancer-fighting ingredient. In general, the deeper and brighter the color of your produce, the better.There are currently no guidelines as the amount of lycopene you should try to get each day. However, research indicates that for lycopene to make any difference, you would need to eat lycopene-foods all day to get the amounts needed.Cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, bok choy and kale are also good defenses against the development of cancer. Some controlled studies have found a link between increased ingestion of cruciferous vegetables and reduced risk of prostate cancer, although the evidence is merely associative at this point.;
, Cut back on how much red meat you eat, including beef, pork, lamb and goat. It's also a good idea to limit your consumption of processed meats, like sandwich meat and hot dogs.Instead of red meat, eat fish with high levels of omega-3 acids, including salmon and tuna. These foods will help your prostate as well as your heart and immune system. The research about the relationship between dietary fish intake and prostate cancer prevention is largely based on correlative data and namely, the fact that the Japanese have so few cases of prostate cancer and eat large amounts of fish. Whether there is a causal relationship is still being debated.Beans, skinless poultry, and eggs are also healthy options for protein.

, The properties of soy, which is found in many vegetarian dishes, fight cancer. Sources of soy include tofu, soy nuts, soy flour and soy powders. Swapping cow's milk for soy milk in your cereal or coffee is one way to get more soy into your diet.Note that recent research has found soy beans and some other specific products, such as tofu, to be preventive in prostate cancer. However, this cannot be extrapolated to all soy products, including milk. There are also no current anecdotal or evidence-based guidelines on the amount of soy you should try to incorporate into your diet., Though you don't need to entirely cut out caffeine from your diet, try to limit how much you ingest. For example, limit yourself to one to two 4-ounce cups of coffee per day. The same goes for alcohol; try to view it as a treat and stick to a couple of small glasses a week.Avoid sugary (sometimes also caffeinated) drinks like sodas and fruit juices. These have nearly zero nutritional benefit.

, The best way to cut back on how much sodium you consume is to eat fresh produce, dairy, and meats and avoid packaged, canned, and frozen foods. Salt is often used as a preservative and is thus present in large amounts in pre-packaged foods.When shopping, stick to the outer perimeter of the grocery store as much as possible. This is where most of the fresh food is located, while cartons, cans, and other packages tend to be isolated in the center aisles.
Take the time to read and compare food labels. Most food labels are now required to state how much sodium is in a product and what percentage it makes up of your daily recommended intake of sodium.
The American Heart Association recommends that Americans consume less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day., Limit your consumption of saturated fats from animal and dairy products and instead switch to healthy fats, like olive oil, nuts, and avocados. Animal products high in fat, such as meat, butter, and lard, have been associated with an increase risk of prostate cancer.Avoid fast food and most processed foods. These often contain partially hydrogenated fats (trans fats), which are extremely unhealthy.

Take supplements.,
Don't smoke.,
Maintain a healthy weight.,
Exercise regularly.,
Perform Kegel exercises.,
Ejaculate often.",How to Improve Prostate Health2," Cancer research has emphasized the importance of getting your nutrients from food instead of vitamin supplements whenever possible.However, there may be cases where a supplement is a better option for you. Be sure to discuss any supplements you are taking or thinking about taking with your physician.


Take zinc supplements. Most men do not get enough zinc in their diets, and supplements can help keep your prostate healthy. Research has demonstrated that zinc deficiencies can lead to enlarged prostates and that zinc plays a role in the progression of prostate cells to malignancy. You can take 50 to 100 (or even up to 200) milligrams of zinc per day in tablet form to reduce an enlarged prostate.Try taking saw palmetto berry, made from the berries of the Saw Palmetto plant. This supplement has received mixed reviews from users and the medical field, so talk to your doctor before you try it. Some research has suggested that it may assist in the cytotoxicity (cell death) of human prostate cancer cells.Note that some research has suggested that taking certain supplements, such as vitamin E, or folic acid (a B vitamin) may even increase your risk of prostate cancer. Other studies has demonstrated that taking many (i.e., more than 7) supplements, even those marked for prostate cancer, may increase the risk of developing advanced prostate cancer., Although the relationship of prostate cancer and smoking has been long debated, tobacco use is believed to cause oxidative damage via free radicals to the body's cells, thus making the link between cancer and smoking plausible. In a meta-analysis of 24 studies, researchers found that cigarette smoking was in fact a risk for prostate cancer., If you are overweight, get yourself on a diet and exercise plan that will get you into a healthy range. Whether someone is overweight or obese is determined by using the body mass index (BMI), an indicator of body fatness. BMI is a person's weight in kilograms (kg) divided by the square of the person's height in meters (m). A BMI of 25-29.9 is considered overweight, while a BMI greater than 30 is considered obese.Reduce the number of calories you intake and increase the amount of exercise you do. This is the secret to weight loss.Watch portion sizes and make a concerted effort to eat slowly, savor and chew your food and stop eating when you are full. Remember that you just need to feel satiated, not stuffed to the brim., Regular activity is not only good for reducing your risk of certain types of cancers, but also other potential health problems, including depression, heart disease and stroke. Though a causal relationship between exercise to prostate health remains unconfirmed, the studies that have been conducted to date suggest that exercise is beneficial in keeping your prostate healthy. You should aim for 30 minutes of moderate to intense exercise several days a week. However, even low to moderate exercising, like brisk walking, is beneficial for prostate health. If you're new to exercising, start slowly by walking to work, using the stairs instead of the elevator and going on nightly walks. Build up to more intense workouts involving aerobic exercise, like cycling, swimming, or running., Kegel exercises are performed by contracting the muscles of your pelvic floor (as if you were attempting to stop the flow of urine), holding them for a brief period, and then releasing them. Doing these exercises regularly will help strengthen and tighten the muscles of your pelvic floor. You can do Kegel exercises anywhere because they don't require any special equipment!


Tighten the muscles around your scrotum and anus for a few seconds, then release. Do this exercise in 10 repetitions three to four times a day to improve your prostate health. Try to build up to 10-second holds.
You can also do Kegel exercises by lying on your back with your pelvis in the air and clenching your buttocks. Hold for 30 seconds, then release. Do this for five minute intervals three times a day.

, Although for a long time, researchers believed that frequent ejaculation during sex, masturbation, or even a dream increased men's risk of developing prostate cancer, newer research is suggesting in fact, that frequent ejaculation may actually protect the prostate. Researchers suggest that ejaculation may help to flush out carcinogens in the prostate glands as well as help fluids in the prostate turn over more quickly to reduce cancer risk. In addition, regular ejaculation may also help to reduce psychological tension, which can slow the growth of cancer cells.That said, this research is still in its early stages and researchers have said that it's too soon to yet make a formal recommendation on men's sexual habits. It's unclear, for example, how often a man should ejaculate to see these benefits. These researchers do suspect, however, that ejaculation frequency accompanies other indicators of a healthy lifestyle, including a healthy diet and regular exercise."

Be aware of your family history.,
Know the symptoms of a potential prostate problem.,
See your doctor regularly.",How to Improve Prostate Health3," Having immediate male family members (such as a father or brother) with prostate cancer significantly increase your risk of developing it yourself. In fact, the risk is more than doubled! It's essential that you notify your doctor of any family history of prostate cancer so you can work together to build a comprehensive preventive program.Note that the risk is high for men with a brother diagnosed with prostate cancer than a father. In addition, the risk is increased for those men who have multiple relatives with prostate cancer, especially if those relatives were diagnosed at a young age (e.g., before 40).Ask your doctor to test to see if you have mutations of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, which may increase your chances of prostate cancer., These include erectile dysfunction, blood in your urine, pain when you urinate or have sex, pain in the hips or low back, or always feeling like you need to urinate.However, prostate cancer is often asymptomatic, at least until it has spread to affect other parts of the body, such as the bones. Patients diagnosed with prostate cancer rarely report the above symptoms of incontinence, blood in the urine, impotence, etc.

, The American Cancer Society recommends getting screened for prostate cancer beginning at age 50 (or age 45 if you have any risk factors for prostate cancer). Screening involves the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. PSA is a substance made by both the normal and cancer the cells in your prostate that is found in a small amount in the blood. Most men have PSA levels of 4 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) of blood, and the higher the PSA leve, the higher the chance of cancer. The gap between screenings depends on the results of this test. Men who have a PSA of less than 2.5 ng/mL need retesting every 2 years, whereas men with higher PSA levels should be tested annually.A digital rectal exam (DRE) may also be included in the screening. In this exam, a clinician will feel for a nodule on the back side of the prostate.Neither the PSA nor the DRE is conclusive. You will likely need a biopsy to diagnose prostate cancer.At present, the American Cancer Society recommends that men should make an informed decision about prostate screening after detailed discussion with their primary care physicians. Screening can help locate cancers early, but there is no conclusive research as to whether screening actually saves lives. That said, catching the cancer earlier increases the chance that it can be treated successfully."

See your doctor.",How to Get More Testosterone," How much testosterone your body produces has a lot to do with diet, so it's important to become aware of exactly what you're eating. A good testosterone-friendly diet includes plenty of healthy fats, green leafy vegetables, protein and cholesterol (it's not all bad!). Low-fat diets should be avoided when trying to boost testosterone.


For example, minerals such as zinc and magnesium help to get testosterone production started, while a healthy level of cholesterol allows your Leydig cells to actually make testosterone.
In addition, veggies such as broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage work to lower the levels of estrogen (a female hormone) in your body, thus boosting testosterone levels.;
, Incorporating a handful or two of walnuts or almonds into your daily diet is a great, easy way to increase testosterone levels.


Also try branching out to brazil nuts, cashews, peanuts and other nuts high in monounsaturated fats, as men who regularly consume these fats have higher testosterone levels than men who don't.Seeds, such as sunflower and sesame seeds, also provide high levels of monounsaturated fats, in addition to protein, vitamin E and zinc, all of which boost testosterone.
For the healthiest option, go for the unflavored, unsalted versions of nuts and seeds.

, Zinc is one of the most important minerals your body needs for the production of testosterone. In fact, increasing your zinc intake can significantly raise testosterone levels in as little as six weeks.If you're looking for a quick fix, six oysters is all the boost your body needs to produce more testosterone, as oysters contain loads of zinc.But if shellfish isn't your thing, you can also increase your zinc intake by eating protein-rich meats and fish, along with raw dairy products such as milk and cheese, all of which contain high levels of zinc.
If you're finding it difficult to increase your zinc intake through diet alone (especially as a vegan or vegetarian) you can help the process along by taking a zinc supplement. The recommended intake for adults is no more than 40 mg per day.

, The health benefits of oatmeal are well-known - it is high in fiber and low in fat - but now there is one more reason to start your day with a bowl of oats: a 2012 study has shown that oatmeal is linked with increased levels of testosterone.


The study found evidence that compounds in oats called avenacosides can limit the level of sex-hormone-binding globulins in the system, thus increasing testosterone levels.Oatmeal has also been shown to improve sexual performance. It loaded with L-arginine, an amino acid that reacts with nitric oxide to relax blood vessels. When those blood vessels expand, blood flow is increased mightily.

, Eggs are basically a testosterone-producing superfood. Their yolks contain high levels of HDL (a.k.a. the ""good"" type of cholesterol) which forms the building blocks of testosterone production.


In addition, eggs are high in protein and loaded with zinc - two more testosterone producing essentials.
Don't worry about your arteries - eating ""good"" cholesterol will not raise your blood cholesterol levels (unlike ""bad"" cholesterol such as triglycerides) so you can eat up to three whole eggs a day without compromising your health.

, Cabbage (along with other leafy green veg such as spinach and kale) can do wonders for your testosterone levels. It contains a phytochemical called indole-3-carbinol (IC3) which has the dual effect of increasing male hormones while decreasing female ones.


Specifically, a study conducted at Rockefeller University Hospital showed that estrogen levels were reduced by up to 50% in men who took 500 mg of IC3 a week, thus making existing testosterone levels much more effective.
The most effective way to increase your IC3 levels at home is to eat plenty of cabbage, so try making cabbage soup, cabbage rolls, cabbage juice, or good old cabbage and potatoes.

, Scientists have found that obese men are 2.4 times more likely to have low testosterone than their counterparts, so it's important that you attempt to shed any extra pounds in order to increase testosterone.The fastest way to do this is to cut as much processed sugar from your diet as possible.


If you are an avid soda drinker, that should be the first thing to go. Sodas are filled with processed sugars and empty calories, which lead to insulin resistance and weight gain. Just by cutting your daily can of soda from your diet, you could be eliminating a ton of calories.
Fructose is a type of sugar found in processed foods and fruit juices. It is believed to be one of the major factors behind modern-day obesity. To decrease your fructose intake, cut out processed food and drinks, along with refined carbohydrates found in breakfast cereals, bagels, pretzels, waffles etc. , It's technically a hormone, but a really important one at that. Studies show that people who regularly take D3 supplements actually have higher testosterone levels., While they may be in vogue, they certainly don't help your little helpers produce more T. These are the things you should stay away from:


Vitamin C. Unless you have diabetes, you won't benefit much from taking this supplement to boost your testosterone. While it may be beneficial in boosting T in diabetic rats, that's about the extent of the scientific evidence.You're most likely getting enough vitamin C from your diet.
ZMA. ZMA is a supplement blend of zinc, magnesium, and vitamin B6. Recent studies have found that ZMA has absolutely no effect on the production of testosterone in men.Unless you know you have deficiencies in any one of these categories, steer clear.

Do your research. Research supplements that claim to help raise testosterone levels. If you're unsure, be your own advocate and make an informed decision. Just because it's out there on the internet does not make it true.

, If you're hoping to increase your testosterone levels, diet isn't the only thing to consider. Exercise is an equally important part of increasing testosterone levels, which is why you should come up with an effective, yet sustainable fitness plan designed to maximize testosterone production.


Specific types of exercise, such as weightlifting, actually cause the body to produce more testosterone.
Exercising decreases your chances of being overweight and, as discussed above, being overweight can negatively impact testosterone levels.If you're not sure where to begin, it may be a good idea to enlist the services of a personal trainer who can develop an exercise plan specifically tailored to your current fitness level, along with your desired outcome.

, If you want to boost testosterone, you should begin to lift weights, as weight-lifting is the most effective form of exercise for increasing testosterone production. However, for best results, you will need to lift heavier weights with fewer repetitions, and it's probably best to avoid the weight machines altogether. Stick with free weights and follow the advice below:



Lift large muscle groups. Studies show that lifting larger muscle groups, which require complex, compound movements, is much more effective for producing testosterone than working just one or two smaller muscles.For this reason, you should stick with weight exercises such as bench presses, squats, deadlifts, and shoulder presses.

Try to work out with high volume. The type of exercises you perform will mean nothing if you don't have enough volume. You should be doing at least 3 to 4 sets of each compound exercise, using a weight you can only lift 5 times per set. The volume of your workout is determined by this formula: reps x sets x weight = volume. However, when it comes down to a choice between more repetitions or more sets, you should choose more sets every time.

Focus on high intensity. Push yourself hard in the gym - only by pushing yourself to your physical limit will you maximize your testosterone production. Increase intensity by performing each exercise more slowly and by resting for no longer than two minutes between sets, High intensity interval training, or HIIT, is another form of exercise which can actively increase testosterone levels, in addition to improving fitness and speeding up the metabolism.


HIIT involves performing an exercise in a short, intense burst then following it up with an easier, recovery exercise. This process is then repeated several times throughout the workout.This type of exercising can be adapted for most types of exercise - you can perform HIIT on the treadmill, the elliptical, in the swimming pool, etc. Just use the following formula: perform the high-intensity exercise for approximately 30 seconds, then follow it up with approximately 90 seconds of slower recovery exercise. Repeat this 7 more times for best results.Even 20 minutes of this type of exercise can reap huge rewards - so there's no excuse for not finding the time.

, While cardio exercise won't have a huge impact on testosterone production, it can still have a positive impact on overall testosterone levels. As a result, you should try to incorporate some running, swimming, spinning or other aerobic exercise into your fitness plan.


Cardio is one of the best ways to burn fat, so incorporating a little running or swimming into your weekly exercise plan will help you to shed any extra pounds. This is good news, as being overweight can negatively impact testosterone.
When you're stressed, your body releases a chemical called cortisol which, amongst other things, inhibits testosterone production. Cardio exercise is also a great form of stress-relief so it can reduce your body's cortisol production, thus increasing testosterone.
However, cardio should be practiced in moderation - there's no need to become a long-distance runner. In fact, a study conducted by the University of British Columbia found that male runners who ran more than 40 miles (64 km) per weeks had lower levels of testosterone than short-distance runners., Despite the importance of exercise, it is imperative that you give your body the time it needs to recover between workouts. Otherwise, your exercise regime may be having a negative effect on your testosterone levels.


A study conducted by the University of North Carolina found that over-training can decrease men's testosterone levels by up to 40%. Therefore, it is very important that you take at least two days off from intense exercise per week, and that you avoid working the same muscle groups in two consecutive training sessions.On days when you're not exercising intensely, just try to be more more active than usual. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk or bike to work, use a standing desk instead of sitting down all day. These small changes help to keep your body moving, which is good news for testosterone levels.

, Sleep is a very important factor when it comes to testosterone levels. This is because your body uses the time you're asleep to produce more testosterone. Therefore, you should do your very best to get at least 7 to 8 hours sleep a night.


A study conducted at the University of Chicago found that men who spent less than 5 hours sleeping for 7 consecutive nights produced 10% to 15% less testosterone compared to when they were fully rested.In addition to decreased testosterone production, being sleep deprived also increases the amount of cortisol (the stress hormone) in your system, and high levels of cortisol negatively impact testosterone levels.
Not getting enough sleep also interferes with your growth hormones, which can prevent you from building muscle when you work out.You should also try to improve the quality of your sleep by turning off all computers and electronics an hour before bed, avoiding caffeinated drinks late in the evening, and having a hot shower before bed.

, Many experts believe that stress is one of the major contributing factors in the widespread fall in testosterone levels in modern day men. This is because the hormone which causes stress - cortisol - has been found to have an inverse relationship with testosterone.


In other words, when cortisol levels are high, testosterone levels are low, and vice versa. It is believed that cortisol, which puts your body in ""fight or flight"" survival mode, conflicts with testosterone-related behaviors such as aggression, competition and mating. This is why the two cannot co-exist harmoniously.In order to maximize testosterone levels, it is important to minimize stress in any way you can. Consider trying deep breathing techniques, meditation, yoga or visualization.

, Alcohol can have a negative impact on your testosterone production. Binge drinking can negatively affect the endocrine system, which, in turn, prevents the testes from producing testosterone.


In addition, alcohol raises cortisol levels and inhibits growth hormones - bad news for testosterone.
Unfortunately, beer is the worst type of alcohol when it comes to healthy testosterone. This is because the hops used to make beer are full of estrogen (the female hormone). So you might switch to drinking liquor instead, or nothing at all.When drinking, it's best to cut yourself off after two/three drinks, as this will limit the damage to your testosterone levels.

, Caffeine needs to be taken in moderation, otherwise it can produce cortisol, which negatively impacts testosterone levels.In addition, consuming too much caffeine late in the day can disrupt sleeping patterns - and less sleep means less testosterone.
However, recent studies have shown that consuming caffeine before a workout can actually boost your performance - so if you're really craving a cup of coffee, have one before you pump iron. , Luckily, increasing your testosterone levels doesn't have to be all work and no play. There are several enjoyable things you can do to boost your T.



Watch more sports. Researchers at the University of Utah have found that the testosterone levels of sports fans are linked with their favorite team's performance. The testosterone levels of the research subjects increased by up to 20% when their team won, but decreased by the same percentage when their team lost. Therefore you should feel completely justified in watching more sports - as long as you're sure your team will win!Have more sex. You probably know that testosterone is what fuels men's sex drive, but did you know that it also works the other way around? That's right; having sex can actually increase your testosterone levels. And not only that - just the fact of having an erection, or getting turned on by an attractive woman is enough to boost testosterone.Enjoy the great outdoors. Getting outside and enjoying the sunshine can be hugely beneficial to testosterone. In fact, exposing yourself to those vitamin D filled rays for just 15 to 20 minutes a day can increase T levels by a whopping 120%. If you can sunbathe naked, the results are even higher. Just don't get caught., Studies have found that men with high blood pressure are 1.8 times likelier to have low testosterone than their counterparts.There are specific diets than you can start on — such as the DASH diet — in order to decrease your high blood pressure and improve your testosterone levels.
Other factors such as reducing stress, cutting out booze and alcohol, and maintaining a healthy weight can all help to reduce blood pressure.
And if all else fails, blood pressure medication can help to keep your hypertension under control. See your doctor to figure out the best course of action for you.

, Xenoestrogens are chemicals that mimic the effects of estrogen in the body, which is bad news for your testosterone levels. Unfortunately xenoestrogens (like other endocrine disruptors) have infiltrated almost every part of daily lives and are impossible to avoid completely. Here are some ways you can limit your exposure:


Avoid heating food in plastic containers. If you're heating up leftovers, make sure to transfer your food to a plate before popping in the microwave. Most plastic containers contain phthalates (a type of xenoestrogen) which can be transferred to your food when the plastic is heated. If possible, store your food in glass containers instead.
Limit exposure to pesticides and gasoline. Both of these contain xenoestrogens, so try to limit your exposure as much as possible. If you come in contact with either, wash your hands thoroughly afterwards.
Eat organic produce. Non-organic foods are often sprayed with pesticides and pumped with hormones which mimic the effects of estrogen in the body. Choose organic product when possible, or at least wash fruit and veg thoroughly before eating and avoid meat and dairy products which come from cows that have been treated with hormones.
Use natural grooming products. Items such as shampoos, soaps, toothpastes and deodorants can introduce xenoestrogens to the body, so consider making the switch to more natural versions of these products., If you believe you may be suffering from a condition called low-T, consult with your doctor. Your doctor will be able to prescribe medicine that will help your body produce more of its super-hormone.

They have three pairs of legs and peculiar claws on four of their legs. They get the name crabs from their resemblance to crabs. The nits or eggs of pubic lice are shiny, oval, and stick to the base of pubic hair.The eggs usually hatch into ‘nymphs’ in 8-10 days. These mature into adults in about two weeks. Adult pubic lice are smaller and broader than hair lice. They only live in humans and need blood to survive. They may feed up to five times a day.;
, You'll see nits attached to your hair or lice crawling in your genital area. Pubic lice bite to feed on blood, so you'll notice itchiness that could cause inflamed skin. The biting can lead to tiny bruises in the genital area and severe itching. You may also notice small blood spots in your underwear. Sometimes, you'll have skin lesions that fill with pus from a bacterial infection. They do not however transmit any diseases.


In unusual cases, pubic lice have also been found in the eyebrows, eyelashes, and in the armpit region. This can cause itching, red eyes, and inflamed eyelids., Look for 1% permethrin or pyrethrin lotions or shampoos. These lotions are insecticides and neurotoxins to lice. You can purchase them at any supermarket or drugstore. Permethrin or pyrethrin lotions kill only live lice and not the eggs, so you'll need to do a second treatment about a week after the first treatment. This will kill newly hatched lice.If you are pregnant, talk to your doctor to make sure that you are getting the best, safest treatment.
Avoid home remedies like taking hot baths or shaving the area. These won't actually kill the pubic lice., Before you apply any treatment, you should make sure that your pubic region is clean and dry. Use soap and warm water to completely clean the area infested by crabs. Use a clean towel to dry the area.

, Read and follow the package instructions carefully to get the most benefit from the product that you have chosen. Remember to ask your doctor if you have any questions about how to use the product., Shampoos may only need to be left on for about 10 minutes, but lotions and creams may need to be left on for 8-14 hours. Note the time when you apply the product and set a timer or watch the time., After you have left the product on for the indicated amount of time, rinse it off with warm water. Rinsing away the product will help to remove dead nits and lice from your skin. It is important to rinse the dead parasites away because they may lead to hygiene problems if left on your skin.Be sure to separate the towels you used from your other clothes and linens. Wash the towels separately to avoid cross-contamination to other clothing and linens.
In some cases where nits stays in the base of the hair, you can just remove them using your fingernails or a fine toothed comb.

, You need a special nit comb designed to catch the tiny nits and remove them from your hair. A regular hair comb won’t work. Carefully comb through your hair, section by section. Dip the comb in a solution of hot, soapy water to get rid of the nits as you go.


When you're done, sterilize the comb by washing it with hot, soapy water. Rinse the pubic area to remove dead lice or nits.
You can also use clean tweezers to carefully pluck away the nits.This will prevent them from hatching, causing another outbreak of pubic lice a few weeks later.

, These lice are treated using a special grade of petroleum jelly that is safe to apply on the eyes. It is available only by prescription, so if you see signs of lice in the eye area let your doctor know. Apply the medication to the margins of your eyelids 2 to 4 times a day for 10 days.Don't use the regular lice shampoos near your eyes. Instead, your doctor might prescribe a special medication or you could pluck the lice using tweezers., If you try an over-the-counter treatment and the lice won’t go away, see your doctor to get a prescription for stronger medication. See a doctor if you have any of the following:severe redness due to itching
persistent infestation that won’t go away after treating with OTC medication
pus formation from secondary bacterial infection
red and itchy eyes
fever over 100 degrees

, To prevent further infestation, put on clean clothes and underwear following treatment. Any clothes that you were wearing prior to treatment should be washed right away.

, Once you've treated crabs, wash any clothing, bedding, and linens that you used in the past month. Lice and nits in bedding, towels, and clothing must be killed by machine washing and drying. You must use hot water when machine washing. You should also use the hottest setting on your dryer for at least 20 minutes.Repeat this process after each treatment. Continue until all of the lice are gone from both your body and your belongings.


Store the items in sealed plastic bags until they're washed. If you can't wash them, you can store them sealed in plastic bags for 2 weeks. By this point, all the lice should die., Watch the area over the next few weeks for signs of lice. If you see more lice or experience itching and redness, follow the same process to retreat the area within a week of the first treatment.


Some creams only kill live lice, not the nits, so you'll definitely need to retreat the area once the nits hatch.

, Tell all of your sexual partners from within the previous month that you have pubic lice. You and your partners may be more likely to have gonorrhea or chlamydia which are common in people with pubic lice. You and your partners should be evaluated and tested for the full range of STDS.In the meantime, avoid any sexual contact until you no longer have pubic lice.


Using condoms does not prevent the spread of pubic lice, since it spreads on close skin to skin contact

Recognize the symptoms of PID.,
Take a warm Epsom salt bath.,
Avoid natural antibiotics.,
Make an appointment with your family physician.,
Talk to your doctor about antibiotics.,
Be aware of complications.,
Prevent PID by practicing safe sex.,
Practice good hygiene.,
Boost your immune system.",How to Treat PID (Pelvic Inflammatory Disease)," PID doesn't often produce any symptoms during the early stages — especially if the infection is caused by chlamydia;however, when symptoms are present they usually include: pelvic and lower abdominal pain, low back ache, heavy vaginal discharge that smells unpleasant, irregular menstrual bleeding, chronic fatigue, pain during sexual intercourse and urination, and mild fever.In the United States, almost 1 million women develop PID each year, and one in eight sexually active girls will get PID before they turn 20 years old.Risk factors for contracting PID include: being sexually active, multiple sexual partners, not practicing safe sex, a history of having STIs, use of intrauterine devices, young age (14 – 25 years), and frequent vaginal douching.;
, If you have symptomatic PID with pelvic and/or lower abdominal pain, then soaking your lower body in a warm Epsom salt bath can significantly reduce spasm, pain and swelling.The high magnesium content of the Epsom salt acts to soothe and relax muscle tension and cramping related to PID. Pour warm water in a bathtub and add a few cups of Epsom salt. You should start to feel results within 15-20 minutes of soaking in the tub.


Don't make your bath water too hot or soak for longer than 30 minutes at a time, because the hot salty water can pull moisture from your skin and potentially dehydrate you.
Alternatively, apply moist heat to your pelvic/abdominal muscle cramps — microwaved herbal bags work quite well, especially the ones infused with aromatherapy (such as lavender) which have muscle-relaxing effects.

, While some home remedies may seem easier and less expensive than going to the doctor, PID is a very serious disease and can cause irreparable damage to your reproductive organs. You should not try to treat it yourself — it is essential that you see a doctor immediately and receive treatment.

Relying on home treatments to treat PID will only prolong the infection — early treatment is important to minimize complications.
You may want to discuss supplementing your diet with things like garlic and turmeric with your doctor. These home remedies are not replacements for antibiotics, but have antibacterial properties that could potentially help your body combat the infection.

, If you are experiencing any symptoms if PID and suspect that you might have PID, then see your family doctor or gynecologist as soon as you can. Your doctor will likely give you a physical (pelvic) exam, take a vaginal swab/sample, get your blood analyzed for signs of infection and possibly order imaging tests (ultrasound, CT scan or MRI) in order to rule out or confirm a diagnosis of PID.During a pelvic exam, your doctor will look for: vaginal and cervical pain, tenderness in your uterus, tubes or ovaries, bleeding from your cervix, a foul-smelling vaginal discharge.
Blood test results that indicate an infection include a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cells (WBCs).The earlier you get a diagnosis, the more effectively PID can be treated and the lower your risk of complications (see below).

, The primary medical treatment for PID is antibiotic therapy. Your doctor will likely prescribe a combination of medications to be most effective, such as: doxycycline combined with metronidazole, ofloxacin combined with metronidazole, or cephalosporin with doxycycline.If you have severe PID, you may need to stay in the hospital and receive antibiotics intravenously (through a vein in your arm). Antibiotics can help prevent serious complications related to PID, but they can't reverse any damage that's already occurred.


If your PID is caused by an STI, such as like gonorrhea or chlamydia, then your sexual partner should be treated with antibiotics or appropriate medications also.
While taking antibiotics, your symptoms may fade away before the infection is completely cured, so always follow your doctor's advice and finish off your medicine as prescribed.

, In most cases, antibiotic therapy is enough to combat PID, but sometimes the medications aren't effective or the infection is severe or becomes chronic — making it much more difficult to treat. In these instances, your may experience serious complications of PID, such as infertility (inability to get pregnant), scar tissue formation around the Fallopian tubes that causes a tubal blockage, ovarian abscesses, ectopic pregnancy (outside the womb), and chronic pelvic/abdominal pain.Recent research indicates that women with PID are also at higher risk of a heart attack.


In about 85% of PID cases, the initial treatment succeeds and about 75% of the time women don't experience a recurrence of the infection.When there is a recurrence of PID, the likelihood of infertility increases with each subsequent episode.
Some complications, such as tubal-ovarian abscesses, are life-threatening and require immediate surgery. A blocked Fallopian tube, however, is not life-threatening and not something that necessarily requires treatment.
More frequent doctor's visits and gynecological exams may help reduce the risks of developing complications from PID.

, The exchange of body fluids during sexual contact is the most common way a woman contracts PID. Chlamydia and gonorrhea are the most common sexually transmitted infections that cause PID.Know the health status of any sexual partner and always practice safe sex with them, preferably via the barrier method such as having your partner wear a condom. Condom usage doesn't completely eliminate the risk of transferring sexually transmitted diseases among people, but it significantly reduces it.


Avoid unprotected intercourse at all times, but particularly during menstruation when the risk of bacterial infection and growth is higher.
Have your partner wear a new latex or polyurethane condom for all types of sex acts.
STIs such as chlamydia and gonorrhea can't penetrate latex or polyurethane, but sometimes condoms get ripped or are used incorrectly. That's why they aren't 100% protective.

, In addition to practicing safe sex and being aware of the risk factors, practicing good hygiene — especially after going to the bathroom — is of great importance for reducing the likelihood of developing PID.Bathe regularly and wipe yourself from front to back after urinating or having a bowel movement in order to reduce the risk of introducing bacteria from your rectum into your vagina. In addition to STIs (as noted above), E. coli bacteria from feces can also cause PID.


Remember to wash your genitalia, even if it's just with antiseptic baby wipes, immediately after sexual encounters.
Vaginal douching may put you at greater risk for PID. Douching can upset the balance of ""good"" bacteria in your vagina and allow the ""bad"" pathogenic types to grow unchecked.
Keep in mind that bacteria can also enter your vagina during childbirth, miscarriage, abortion procedures, an endometrial biopsy and while inserting an intrauterine device (IUD)., To combat any type of internal infection (bacterial, viral or fungal), true prevention depends on a healthy and strong immune response. Your immune system consists of specialized white blood cells that search for and attempt to destroy bacteria and other microorganisms that can cause disease, but when the defense system is weakened or malfunctioning, bacteria can grow unchecked and then spread to other reproductive organs via the blood.Thus, focus on ways to keep your immune system strong and functioning properly in order to help prevent PID.


Getting more sleep (or better quality sleep), eating more fresh fruits and vegetables, practicing good hygiene, drinking adequate amounts of purified water and regular cardiovascular exercise are all proven ways to boost your immunity.Your immune system will also benefit by cutting back on refined sugars (sodas, candy, ice cream, most baked goods), reducing your alcohol intake and stopping smoking.
Vitamin, mineral and herbal supplements that can boost people's immune response include: vitamins A, C and D, zinc, selenium, echinacea, olive leaf extract and astragalus root."

Many sexual disorders have an underlying medical cause. If you know the reason why you have a sexual disorder, you can bring this to your partner’s attention.Your doctor may perform a physical exam or additional tests to determine the underlying problem. Your doctor may also send you to a specialist or give you a referral to a sex therapist who can help you determine any causes for your sexual problems.For example, diabetes can lead to sexual problems in both males and females.
You may want to ask your doctor for suggestions on how to work on the sexual problems at home.;
, There are various different sexual disorders that people can have. These disorders also vary depending on your gender. Men and women face different sexual problems which may specifically deal with their genitalia, or may have a mental or psychological disorder that affects the normal function of their sexual organs. Being able to tell your partner what your problem is can help you both figure out a way to deal with it.



Erectile dysfunction is a common sexual disorder for men. Men who have erectile dysfunction have trouble getting and maintaining erections.Men may also face premature, delayed, or inhibited ejaculation. Men can also face a low libido, leading to less interest in sex.Women can face desire disorders (where they may not be interested in or have less desire for sex), arousal disorders (where they don’t feel arousal), orgasmic disorders (where they have trouble having orgasms or feel pain during an orgasm), or sexual pain disorders, where they feel pain during or after sexual intercourse.Aging and hormonal changes, including a reduction in estrogen in women and testosterone in men, can lead to sexual problems.Menopause in women can cause sexual problems, such as lack of lubrication.Stress, anxiety, and depression can lead to sexual disorders.

Sex addiction is another sexual disorder., One good way to prepare for talking to your partner about your sexual disorder is to write down your thoughts. When you get face-to-face with your partner, you may get embarrassed, frustrated, or upset, which may interfere with your thoughts. Prepare ahead of time so you know what you want to say.You can write down your thoughts onto a piece of paper you have with you when you talk to your partner. You may want to write out complete sentences or just list bullet points with ideas so you are reminded of points you wanted to make.
You may want to practice out loud what you want to say so it’s easier for you when you get in front of your partner.

, Because you know you have a sexual disorder, you may have been pulling away from your partner or have stopped wanting to have have sex. This may lead your partner confused and hurt. Before you talk to your partner, think about how your actions may have been perceived so you can think about ways to approach or reassure your partner.

Your partner may feel pushed aside, confused, and hurt because he or she doesn’t believe you feel attracted to him or her anymore.
Your partner may have become self-conscious because he or she believes there is something wrong with his or her body that has caused you to stop being interested.
Be prepared for your partner to think that you may be having an affair. Don’t get defensive, but be prepared to face the accusations.

, You should do as much research about the sexual disorder as possible. Your partner may have a lot of questions or be unfamiliar with your problem. You should be able to provide your partner with information to help him or her understand what you are going through.You may want to compile a list of websites or books for your partner to consult so he or she can better understand what you are going through.

, Where you decide to talk to your partner about your sexual disorder is important. You should probably refrain from discussing it in the bedroom because that is the place for intimacy and sex. Instead, talk about it on the couch so you both can be comfortable.Pick a time when you both have an open schedule so you can discuss the topic for as long as needed. You may need to tell your partner, “I have something very important to discuss with you. I would like to know a good time very soon where we can talk uninterrupted.”If you have children, see if you can get a grandparent or friend to watch them while you discuss this. You want the focus to be on your relationship, and you don’t want to be distracted.

, You owe it to both yourself and your partner to be honest with him or her about your sexual disorder. Pretending everything is okay and faking orgasms or pleasure will only cause problems down the road. Opening up the lines of communication with your partner helps start to build intimacy between the two of you, which can help your sexual problems.The sooner you are honest with your partner, the better. Your partner may be upset with you if you have been lying or pretending for years. You may have to explain why you didn’t share your problem with him or her, which brings up trust issues.

, Talking about sexual problems can be really embarrassing and cause guilt, shame, and feelings of self-doubt. When you talk to your partner, use phrases or words that make you comfortable. Tell your partner that you feel embarrassed and this is hard for you. Tell your partner you are uncomfortable. This helps you start to address your discomfort and to let your partner know he or she may need to be understanding and supportive.For example, you may say, “This is really embarrassing. I’m having sexual problems, and I’m not sure how to tell you” or “This is uncomfortable for me. My sexual problems are causing me physical discomfort while trying to figure out how to talk about this is causing me emotional discomfort.”
You may also want to figure out what words you want to use to refer to your genitalia. You may may want to use the medical terms, like vagina or penis, or you may feel more comfortable using slang terms. Use whichever terms make you feel comfortable discussing it.

, More than likely, your partner will be unfamiliar with your sexual disorder. You need to explain it in as much detail as you can to help your partner understand. You may thinks the name of the disorder is obvious, but your partner may be confused about what that means or how it affects you specifically.


If your partner is a different gender, you may need to explain carefully and in detail your sexual problems. For example, if you have erectile dysfunction, your female partner may not understand how you are unable to get an erection. If you have a female lubrication problem, your male partner may not understand what that means and why that causes pain.
If you have a partner of the same gender, you will probably still need to explain how your body is reacting and what is happening to you. A man who has never faced ED may not understand your experience, and a woman who has no problem with lubrication may be confused about what is happening to you. Don’t assume your partner will understand just because he or she has the same genitalia as you.
Don’t be embarrassed. Remember, most sexual disorders are manageable, especially with open communication with your partner.

, Make sure to tell your partner that it is not an issue with him or her, but you. Tell your partner that you still find him or her attractive and desirable and that you do not want anyone else. Emphasize that you still love your partner very much. Your partner may start blaming himself or herself for the sexual problem, so you need to make sure he or she understands that he or she is not the source.Tell your partner that you came to him or her because you love him or her, that you want to regain the sex life you both used to have, and you want his or her help with this problem.

, Sexual disorders can be difficult problems to face. They may leave you feeling like less of a man or woman, less desirable, or with lower self-worth. You may feel anxiety or depression due to the sexual disorder. Share this with your partner and tell him or her that you need to know that he or she is on your side and still loves you.Knowing that your partner supports you and will help you overcome your sexual disorder can be a tremendous help. Many times, sexual disorders can be addressed in the bedroom with understanding and attentive partners who are willing to provide the physical and emotional support needed to address and fight the sexual disorder.

, Make sure to separate love and sex for both you and your partner. Just because you are having sexual problems doesn’t mean you don’t still love one another. Some people equate sexual frustration or the inability of his or her partner to perform sexually with a failure on his or her part. Make sure you separate love and sex when you discuss this with your partner.Remind your partner that it is not his or her fault. Neither of you are at fault. Seventy percent of couples face sexual problems at some point in their relationship. Holding on to the love you feel for each other as you address the sexual issues can help you successfully overcome the sexual disorder.

, You should tell your partner about medical treatment options for your sexual disorder. This includes medication and any other treatments you can get from a doctor or psychiatrist. Ask your partner to support you as you undergo medical treatments.


Treatment for an underlying mental condition, like anxiety or depression, may be required. A psychiatrist may prescribe antidepressants or anti-anxiety medication.A doctor may prescribe hormone shots, pills, or creams if the disorder is caused by a hormone deficiency.Your doctor may medically treat an underlying medical condition, such as diabetes or a thyroid condition. This may include medication.
Women with sexual disorders can take medicine, such as flibanserin, which is supposed to help combat low sexual desire. Women can also undergo estrogen or androgen therapy to help with low libidos or arousal disorders.If you have erectile dysfunction, doctors often prescribe medications like Avanafil, Sildenafil, Tadalafil, and Vardenafil.For premature ejaculation, there is a spray called Promescent that can be used to help reduce sensitivity. Some doctors may prescribe SSRIs, such as Zoloft or Paxil.Your doctor may also suggest aids, such as vacuums, penile implants, or dilators., Sometimes, taking a break from sex can be a good way to address your sexual disorder. Instead of worrying about sex, you and your partner can focus on emotional intimacy. Many sexual disorders occur because of various emotions or stressors that end up affecting the couple’s sex life. Focusing on the relationship can help you strengthen your connection, which can lead to improved sex.For example, you may want to go for walks together, go to dinner, or do other activities. You may want to spend an entire evening talking to one another.
You also may want to spend time touching in non-sexual ways, such as holding hands, holding one another, and kissing for the sake of kissing.

, You may have relationship problems because of the sexual disorder. You and your partner may have had some misunderstandings because of your actions, and you may have developed trust issues. There may be outside stressors that are affecting your relationship. You should work on these issues with your partner to move your relationship past this small bump in the road.Clearing up relationship problems can help lead the way to improved sex. Removing miscommunication, anxieties, and any underlying anger or feelings of resentment can make it easier to feel closer and intimate with your partner.

, You may decide to go see a sex therapist or couples counselor. Going to see a therapist or counselor doesn’t mean that something is wrong with your relationship. Sexual disorders can cause a strain on both partners and the relationship. A sex therapist may help you learn how to build intimacy and work on techniques to address the disorder, while a couples counselor may be able to help you work through any relationship issues that have arisen due to the disorder.If your partner suggests going to counseling, don’t get angry. See it as a way your partner is trying to support you and work on your relationship. Don’t get discouraged if you want to go to counseling but your partner doesn’t.
You can search the internet for certified sex therapists and couples counselors in your area. You may also talk to your doctor or specialists about a referral.

, One way you can help boost your sexual function is to spend more time focusing on foreplay instead of heading straight for intercourse. Foreplay helps both partners enjoy the experience more. Foreplay can help a woman feel aroused and help a man get an erection.Foreplay includes a lot of different things. Take time to explore each other’s bodies and focus on your partner’s pleasure. Don’t rush towards orgasm. Slow down the sexual experience, which can help you overcome your sexual disorder.
During foreplay, you may want to use your hands and your mouth. Try touching different parts of the body, not just the penis or vagina. Make the foreplay experience an emotionally intimate experience as well as a physical one.
Lack of stimulation before intercourse can lead to problems such as a reduced level of arousal, inability to get or hold an erection, lack of lubrication, and inability to reach orgasm. Some people may need some sort of stimulation for up to an hour before they are ready for intercourse.

, Due to your sexual disorder, you and your partner may need some extra help. That’s fine. For women who have trouble with lubrication or painful sex, consider using lubricants or vaginal creams to help with dryness.Use toys to help enhance your sexual experience. Sexual toys may help increase stimulation during foreplay. You can use vibrating toys to stimulate the clitoris to help with female arousal problems, while the vibration may help a man get and maintain an erection.
You may also want to try an erotic video or erotic literature. Watch the video together or read the literature to each other to help increase your physical and emotional intimacy., Some people have never been open or honest about what they like during sex. Take this time to tell your partner what you like or don’t like during sex. Talk about things you’d like to try and experiment with. Try to be as specific as possible for your partner. Consider showing your partner what you like, or walking him or her through what to do for you.

Men who experience erectile problems or women who have trouble getting aroused may need more manual stimulation than his or her partner. Tell your partner that you need this so he or she knows how to help you during sex.Remember to keep your words focused on your and not your partner. Don’t accuse your partner of not satisfying you. Instead, say things like, “I really like when you touch my hair” or “My breasts are really sensitive. I would like you to touch them more.”

, Sometimes, couples get in a rut. They just do the same thing, and that doesn’t lead to arousal or desire anymore. If this is the case for you and your partner, try experimenting. You may want to try different positions, participate in role play, or share fantasies that you both can act out.For women who experience pain during sex, trying new positions may help make intercourse a more pleasurable experience. For example, try being on top so you can control the movement and position.
When talking about role play or fantasies, make sure to remember that each partner may not feel comfortable with everything. You want to try new things your partner wants to try, but don’t feel bad if there are things your partner suggests that you are not willing to do. Find a compromise on both sides where you both willingly engage in situations and fantasies your partner wants to try while still being comfortable.

Be aware of when you'll see results.",How to Recover From Liposuction1," Liposuction is an invasive type of surgery and can have many complications.It’s important to pay attention to your doctor’s post-op instructions and ask any questions you may have. This can help ensure that you heal properly and minimize your risk of complications.You may want to ask your doctor questions about recovery at your last appointment before your surgery so that you understand everything.
Make sure that whoever accompanies you to the surgery also pays attention to the doctor’s instruction in case you are too weary from the surgery or anesthetic to pay close attention.;
, Whether you have your surgery in a hospital or as an outpatient, you will require at least a few days of rest. Generally, you can return to work or school after a few days.Discuss the amount of rest time you may need with your doctor.The recovery period is directly related to the size of the surgical area and amount of fat your doctor removed. If you had a larger area treated, you may need more time to recover.Prepare your home and bedroom before you leave for your surgery. A comfortable environment, including a cozy mattress, pillows, and bedding can help you rest and heal more effectively., Following the surgery, your doctor will apply bandages and possibly also compression garments. Wearing compression bandages and garments can help maintain pressure on the area, stop bleeding, and keep the contours from the surgery.Some doctors do not provide compression garments. You will need to purchase these either before or immediately after your surgery. You can find compression bandages and garments at pharmacies and medical supply stores.It’s important to wear the compression garments. They provide support after surgery as well as helping reduce swelling and bruising and improving circulation, which can promote healing.You will probably want to purchase compression garments designed specifically for the area of your body on which you had surgery.

Control your weight.,
Eat healthy, regular meals.,
Avoid unhealthy foods.,
Participate in cardiovascular exercise.,
Perform strength-training exercises.",How to Recover From Liposuction2," Liposuction removes fat cells permanently, but if you gain weight, it may alter you results or the fat may return to the site at which you had surgery. Maintain your weight to help your surgery result keep the appearance you desire.


It’s best to keep a steady weight. While it might not affect you significantly to gain or lose a pound or two, gaining larger amounts may significantly alter your results.
Staying active and keeping a healthy diet can help you maintain your weight.

, Eating healthy, balanced, and regular meals can help maintain your weight. Foods that have moderate fat, complex carbohydrates, and are high in nutrients, for example, are best for your general health.


Stick to a diet of about 1,800-2,200 nutrient-rich calories a day, depending on how active you are.You will get proper nutrition if you incorporate foods from the five food groups every day. The five food groups are: fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy.You need 1-1.5 cups of fruit per day. You can get this from eating whole fruits such as raspberries, blueberries, or strawberries, or from drinking 100% fruit juice.Make sure to vary the fruits you choose so that you get a range of nutrients and don’t process them in any way. For example, eating a cup of pure berries is much cleaner than eating berries on top of a cake.
You need 2.5-3 cups of vegetables per day. You can get this from eating whole vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, or peppers, or from drinking 100% vegetable juice.Make sure to vary the vegetables you choose so that you get a range of nutrients.
Fruits and vegetables are an excellent source of fiber. Fiber will also help you to maintain your weight.You need between 5-8 ounces of grains per day, of which ½ should be whole grains. You can get grains and whole grains from foods such as brown rice, whole wheat pasta or bread, oatmeal, or cereal.Grains will provide you with vital Vitamin B, which can help aid slowed digestion.You need 5-6.5 ounces of protein per day. You can get protein from lean meats including beef, pork, or poultry; cooked beans; eggs; peanut butter; or nuts and seeds.These will also help you to build and maintain muscle.You need 2-3 cups, or 12 oz., of dairy per day.You can get dairy from cheese, yogurt, milk, soymilk, or even ice cream.Avoid excessive amounts of sodium in your diet, which is prevalent in mass-processed foods. Your sense of taste decreases as you age, and you may want to salt your food. Try using alternative seasonings such as garlic or herbs to help you avoid excess sodium and gaining water weight., If you’re trying to lose weight, it’s a good idea to avoid unhealthy or junk foods, many of which are loaded with fat and calories. Steer clear of the snack food aisles in the grocery store when you go shopping.Potato chips, nachos, pizza, burgers, cake, and ice cream will not help you lose weight.


Stay away from starchy, refined carbs such as bread, crackers, pasta, rice, cereal, and baked goods. Eliminating these foods can also help you maintain your weight.
Look out for hidden sugar in your food choices, which can make you put on weight.

, Doing low-impact, moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise can help you maintain your fitness and may also help you lose weight. Discuss your plan to do cardio training with your doctor and certified fitness professional before you start.


You should do at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise all or most days of the week.If you are just beginning or need to do a lower impact activity, walking and swimming are excellent options.You can do any type of cardio training to help you lose weight. Beyond walking and swimming, consider running, rowing, biking, or using an elliptical machine., In addition to cardiovascular exercise, strength training can help you maintain your weight and liposuction results.Before you begin any strength training program, consult with your doctor and maybe even with a certified trainer, who will create the best plan for your abilities and needs.

Learn the facts concerning marijuana and dependency.,
Look for symptoms of withdrawal when the person stops using marijuana.,
Check for behavioral changes that indicate a marijuana use disorder.,
Know what to expect.,
Speak up.,
Support the person without enabling.,
Avoid approaches likely to cause additional conflict.,
Determine if the person is ready for treatment.,
Assist with finding a therapy to which the person responds.,
Look into treatment facilities.,
Look into group treatment options.,
Watch for signs of relapse.,
Have patience.,
Avoid self-blame.,
Take care of yourself.",How to Help Someone Overcome Marijuana Addiction," One of the biggest hurdles to helping someone with a marijuana dependency is proving that (despite popular belief) marijuana use can lead to addiction. Research has shown that overuse of marijuana can overstimulate certain systems in the body which will cause brain changes leading to addiction. It is estimated that 9 percent of people who use marijuana will become dependent, and 25-50 percent of daily users will become dependent.Adolescents who use marijuana frequently are at risk for decreased IQ scores later in life with research finding that on this population’s IQ is decreased by about 8 points on average.Additionally, a longitudinal study conducted over sixteen years found that marijuana users are four times more likely to develop depression than non-users.Although not as common, abuse of medical marijuana or drugs containing cannabinoids (such as THC) can also occur. THC is just one of over 100 other cannabinoids that the marijuana plant contains.Because cannabinoids have a large effect on the body—affecting everything from pleasure regulation and appetite to memory and concentration—they can have serious health effects when abused.;
, Marijuana can produce symptoms of withdrawal if frequent users discontinue use. Withdrawal is the body’s response to no longer having the drug in the system, and it is usually an indicator that there is physical dependence on the drug. Some of the withdrawal symptoms include:Irritability
Mood changes
Difficulty sleeping
Decreased appetite
Cravings
Restlessness
Various forms of physical discomfort

, Other symptoms of dependency can affect the person’s behavior surrounding use of marijuana and not just reactions to not using it. In the past year, has the person:


Used much more marijuana in one sitting than intended
Tried to stop using marijuana but failed
Had strong cravings or desire to use marijuana
Used marijuana even though it caused or worsened symptoms of depression or anxiety
Had to increase usage to achieve the same effects
Had use interfere with personal responsibilities, school, or work
Continued to use marijuana even though it caused fights or arguments with family or friends
Stopped participating in previously important activities in order to use marijuana
Used marijuana in situations where it may be dangerous, such as driving a car or operating machinery

, Prepare yourself for excuses and denial from your loved one. He or she has likely adapted to marijuana use and does not see that it is an issue. You can prepare for the conversation by listing specific behaviors that worry you or that you have seen change for your loved one.

, You as well as other friends and family should talk to the person about your concerns in a way that is supportive and nonjudgmental. Help the person see the changes the drug has caused in his or her life by helping the person to remember how they were in the past.There may have been goals that your loved one gave up on when turning to marijuana as a way to cope.Reminding your loved one of goals from the past may help him to see a brighter future with purpose.

, Enabling behaviors—such as buying the person groceries or simply handing over money—only assist the person with perpetuating the addiction.Set healthy boundaries with your loved one. Make sure the person knows that you will support them when they are ready to address their issue, but will not continue to provide support that helps them to continue their current behavior. Some examples of healthy boundaries include:


Letting your loved one know that you are available for support and comfort but that drug use will no longer be allowed in your home
Telling your loved one that you care for and love them, but that you will no longer be able to provide them money
Telling the person that you will no longer make excuses for them or try to save them from the potential consequences of their drug use.
Informing your loved one that while you care about them, you will not be able to drop everything to come to their aid for drug-related reasons

, Trying to punish the person, preach at the person, or manipulate the person to quit using (such as with guilt) will only lead to further conflict.The loved one may even decide that you’re “against” them and stop trying to reach out for help at all. Other behaviors to avoid include:Arguing with the person for using
Attempting to hide of throw away the person’s marijuana stash

, On average, those who seek treatment for marijuana addiction (or marijuana use disorder) are adults who have used marijuana for ten years or more and who have tried to quit using six or more times.The most important part is for the person to want to quit using. You can’t monitor anyone twenty-four hours a day, so you have to be able to depend on the person’s will to stop using.

, Individuals can seek treatment for marijuana use disorder through individual or group therapies. The process may be one of trial and error to find what works for your loved one. Therapies used to treat marijuana and other substance-use disorders include:Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) - CBT is used to teach strategies to identify and correct thoughts and behaviors to enhance self-control, stop drug use, and handle other issues that may occur.
Contingency management - This approach uses frequent monitoring of the target behavior and the use of positive reinforcement to help modify behavior.
Motivational enhancement therapy - This therapy aims to produce changes internally driven by the addict’s own motivation to stop using.
Seeing a therapist during this period may also help the person confront the issues that led to marijuana use as a coping mechanism in the first place.
There are no medications on the market for the addiction counselor (via a psychiatrist) to prescribe to treat marijuana addiction.However, a physician may prescribe medication for peripheral issues to help the person with anxiety, depression, or sleep disorders as he or she beats the dependency., Actual treatment facilities for drug addiction can provide a stronger, more consistent environment for the person to beat his or her addiction. The constant monitoring and supervision of many of these facilities is suited toward those who desperately want to quit but whose willpower can falter in the face of dependency.


Marijuana addiction accounts for up to 17 percent of those in treatment facilities for addictions., Support groups for marijuana addiction—such as Marijuana Anonymous—seek to help attendees maintain motivation, learn coping skills, manage thoughts and feelings, and learn about balance and self-care., Despite the best efforts of you and the rest of the person’s support system, relapse is always a possibility. If you think the person may have relapsing into using again, keep an eye out for the following signs:Changes in appetite, sleep, or weight changes
Red and/or glassy eyes
Changes in appearance or personal hygiene
Unusual (skunky) smells on the person’s body, breath, or clothing
Reduced performance at school or work
Suspicious requests for money or outright stealing money from family or friends
Unusual or suspicious behavior
Changes in friends or activities
Changes in motivation or energy
Changes in interpersonal style or attitude
Changes in mood, frequent or sudden irritability, or anger outbursts

, If the person relapses, especially fully as opposed to momentarily, you may feel as though you're starting the process from the beginning again. The best thing you can do for the person in this scenario is have patience. Try as hard as you can to show the same love and support as you did before. Continue refusing to enable the addiction and offer the same assistance with finding treatment.

, You can offer your support, love, and encouragement to your loved one, but remember that you can not make this person change. You cannot control his or her behavior or decisions. Letting your loved one accept responsibility will move your loved one closer to recovery. Being assertive through the process can be painful, but you should never let yourself:Try to take the person’s responsibilities
Give into feelings of guilt over the person’s choices or actions.

, Do not let your loved one’s issue become your main concern to the point that you forget or refuse your own needs. Make sure you have people to support you through this hard time, and seek out people you can talk to when things get tough. Continue to care for yourself and allow time for relaxation and stress relief.

If she is already addicted, then she already needs even more extensive help.;
, Before having a discussion with your friend, it’s a good idea to write down all of the problems that are associated with her drug use.Creating this list allows you to be able to stay focused during the conversation. However, be sure to keep the list as concrete as possible. For example, it’s better to write down, “You damaged the car when you were driving under the influence” than it is to write, “You’re so irresponsible when you’re high.”

, Make sure that the place that you select is free of distractions and will respect her privacy. Inviting her to eat out at a quiet restaurant is probably better than trying to have the discussion in the middle of a party. Also, you may want to try to talk to her in a place other than her home so that she cannot engage in distracting activities in an effort to avoid the conversation.Only begin the conversation when your friend is sober. If you try to talk to her when she is under the influence, she will not be able to have a coherent conversation.
Your friend may become defensive when you first approach her about your concerns. Avoid accusations or arguments. Stick to the facts and remind yourself to stay calm.
If she tries to shift the conversation to you, you can respond by saying something like, “I know that you don’t agree with everything that I do and I will be happy to talk about those things with you later. Right now though, I’m really concerned about your safety.”

, Of course, this is much easier said than done, however having this conversation is very important. Be sure to bring up the topic in a nonjudgmental way. Always begin the conversation by letting your friend know that you are concerned about her. You want her to know that you are genuinely concerned for her well-being.Use statements that are respectful but also clearly communicate your concern.


For example, you could say, “Cheney, I’m here right now because I’m worried about you.”
You might also say “Jenna, I’m concerned that you’re smoking marijuana. You’re important to me and I’m concerned about the impact that your smoking is having on your life…”
Avoid critical and judgmental statements like “I’m so disgusted with you, Cheney.”

, Focus on concrete and nonjudgmental statements that reflect your experiences with her behavior. Don’t discuss what other people may feel or have said because that is often unproductive. Also, avoid making generalizations such as “Everyone thinks that you have a problem.” Stick to the facts as you have experienced them.


Use statements that your friend cannot dispute. For example, you might say, “You left the party with two people that you did not know yesterday. I am very concerned for your safety.”
Always distinguish between your friend as a person and her behavior. Focus on what behaviors your friend is engaging in and not on her as a person. Avoid statements like, “You’re so irresponsible” or “You’re such a bad influence for your children.”
Emphasize the difference between her sober behavior and behavior that occurs when she is not sober. For example, you could say “You are always so adventurous and I love that about you. But when you use drugs, you often do very risky and dangerous things.”

, Your friend may not see drugs as a bad thing, so sharing scientific information may help open her eyes. Once your friend is aware of how much drugs affect her brain, body, life, and relationships, she may be more inclined to stop using on her own.


You should do research on drugs before talking to your friend so that you have the scientific information available during the conversation.
Do not accuse or berate your friend. Just share the information in a respectful way. For example, you could say, “Did you know that mollies can cause you to have a seizure? It can also cause your heart to beat abnormally.”, Advise her to talk to a professional or give her some literature to read. Let her know that you’d be willing to go with her to an appointment or you can volunteer to accompany her to visit treatment facilities. If your friend knows that she has your support, she may be more open to treatment.


Even if your friend is reluctant to seek treatment, you can still research treatment options for her. If you find a treatment facility that appeals to her, she may be more likely to consider treatment.Confide in a trusted adult if your friend is not an adult and she continues to abuse drugs. Keep in mind that your friend may be angry with you or even feel betrayed by you for a while. However, getting an adult involved is the best way to help her. Eventually she will come back around and understand that you had her best interest at heart.

Remind yourself that an addiction is a disease of the brain that usually requires treatment for the person to heal.Just like your friend would need to see a doctor if she was suffering from a physical disease, she will need a professional to help her heal from an addiction. Viewing an addiction as a disease that needs treatment may motivate you to seek help from a trusted adult.



, Knowing exactly how to offer support her can be a little tricky because your friend may not want to hear what you have to say. The drugs are likely impacting her mind and she may have fallen in with a rough circle of friends. However, here are some ways that you can support your friend:Listen to your friend. If she confides in you, be sure to listen in a nonjudgmental way. It’s probably hard for your friend to open up about her drug use.
If your fiend is a teenager, encourage your friend to get help from a trusted adult such as a parent, teacher, relative, counselor, clergyman, or coach.
When she is ready, help her to find a support group or a substance abuse counselor in the local area.

, The team should include four to six people that your friend likes, loves, admires, respects, or depends upon. Each person involved should be genuinely concerned about your friend and should be willing to look her in the eye to tell her that she needs help. It won’t be an easy process, so the team has to be strong and committed to helping her. Try to include a mental health professional or addiction specialist as a part of the team. A professional can help the team stay focused on facts and solutions verses emotional responses that are not always helpful. Keep in mind that having a professional on the team is vital if your friend has any of the following conditions:A history of violence
A history of mental illness
A history of suicidal behavior or she has recently talked about suicide
A history of taking several mood-altering drugs or substances

, Be sure to have a specific plan already in place before the intervention is conducted. Spend time researching the specific addiction so that you can familiarize yourself with the types of treatment that generally work for those individuals. This is important because the type of treatment will vary depending upon the specific drug and level of addiction. Keep in mind that more severe addictions may require hospitalization or admittance into an inpatient treatment facility. However, whether inpatient or outpatient treatment is necessary, a specific treatment program that can be immediately available to your friend should be identified before the intervention is held. Here are some examples of resources that can be used:Local clinics
National organizations that offer treatment programs
Local mental health providers
Narcotics Anonymous, Alcohol Anonymous, Meth Anonymous, and other similar programs
If travel is required, be sure that the arrangements are in place before the intervention occurs.

, Each person on the team has to decide what the individual consequence will be if your friend refuses to get treatment. This often results in some tough decisions and usually includes breaking contact for a period of time.Be prepared to inform your friend that you will not have any more contact with her until she agrees to go to treatment. Remember, it’s tough love but is for her ultimate good.

, The team is responsible for setting the date, place and time of the intervention. Try to choose a time when your friend is least likely to be under the influence. Each member of the team should come to the meeting prepared with a rehearsed message.The focus is only on helping your friend get treatment. Do not be confrontational during the intervention. Your friend should be treated with respect during the entire meeting. It might be helpful to have a rehearsal meeting before having the actual intervention.
Your rehearsed message should include specific incidents when the addiction has caused problematic behaviors. Make sure that your message is worded in a way that expresses concern for your friend. For example, you could begin by saying, “It upsets me when you use drugs. Just last week…”
Be sure that you stick to the rehearsed script. Any deters can quickly result in the intervention going off course. You can make notes to bring in the session if necessary., Inform your friend of the treatment plan and require her to give you an immediate answer. The team shouldn’t give your friend a few days to think about whether or not she wants to accept the treatment offer.Allowing her additional time just reinforces her denial of the problem. Worse, she may go into hiding or participate in a dangerous binge. Require her to give you an immediate answer and be prepared to take her to treatment immediately if she agrees to the plan.


Anticipate your friend’s objections in advance. This way the team can come with prepared responses to her potential objections to treatment.
Not all interventions are successful so emotionally prepare yourself for the possibility of a failed intervention. However, if your friend refuses the plan you should be prepared to follow through on the consequences that you have already identified.

, Once your friend has agreed to the plan, be sure to continue to provide support for herThis might include agreeing to go to counseling sessions with her. It could also mean helping her to change the rituals that supported her addiction. Consider what you can do to support your friend throughout her recovery and offer that support.

, Don’t take for granted that your friend already knows that you are there for her. Tell her that you are proud of her accomplishment; after all, it takes a lot of hard work to become sober again. Let her know how much you enjoy being around your newly sober friend.Be sure to be a good listener. Your friend may find it difficult to live a sober lifestyle, especially during the first year of recovery. Just being a listening ear can be a big support for your friend.
Withhold judgment when talking to your friend. The last thing your friend needs is a sermon about how bad her past mistakes were and how it messed up her life.

, Do an internet search with your friend to look up local support groups. Most people in recovery benefit from being a part of a support group after they finish treatment. A support group can help prevent relapse. Spending time around other people who are in recovery, in a healthy and supportive environment, can help your friend reintegrate back into her normal routine. Some great support groups include:


Alcohol Anonymous
Crystal Meth Anonymous
Narcotics Anonymous
Cocaine Anonymous

Note what medications put you at increased risk.,
Check your herbal supplements.,
Ask your doctor about surgery conditions.,
Make sure to not wear any makeup to your surgery.,
Skip the alcohol.,
Try bromelain.",How to Prevent Bruising After Plastic Surgery1," Some medications can increase your risk of bruising after surgery, such as heart medications and blood thinners. For instance, aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin can all increase your chance of bruising. As most of these medications are necessary to keep you healthy, it's not recommended that you stop them, although, you may be able to stop aspirin for a week before your surgery under a doctor's orders and supervision.Other medications that can lead to this problem include dabigatran, enoxaparin, ticlopidine, and dipyridamole.Have your doctor review your medications to help you determine which ones may lead to more bruising, and when they should be stopped before the surgery and restarted after the operation. Depending on the indication, some of these medications cannot be stopped and will need to be continued throughout the surgical period.;
, Herbal supplements can also lead to an increased risk for bruising. For instance, if you take garlic or ginkgo biloba in pill form, it can increase your chances of bruising. Vitamin E can also have this effect. As these pills are not medically necessary, you may be able to stop them before your surgery; usually, you can take a break from them starting 2 weeks before your surgery., How you are positioned during surgery can affect how much you bruise. Having an open discussion about your concerns before surgery may encourage your doctor to make changes if necessary.For instance, if you are having surgery on your face, your surgery should be conducted with you in a chair with your head on a headrest. In addition, the angle of the chair should be angled back about 30 degrees from straight upright.The room should be bright enough to look for blood vessels, and a side light is especially helpful.

, One way you can help your doctor is by removing all traces of makeup before entering the clinic; it's best not to put any on the morning of your surgery. Makeup can hide your blood vessels. If your doctor nicks a blood vessel, it can lead to more extensive bruising.You can also ask what your doctor uses to look for blood vessels to help reassure you. Some use magnifying glasses, while others use more advanced technology, such as devices that use infrared technology to help your doctor look for blood vessels., The night before your surgery and the night of your surgery, it's best to skip the alcohol. Alcohol can make bruising worse., While studies aren't conclusive about this natural remedy, some people have had luck with it reducing bruising. Make sure your doctor knows you plan to take it around your surgery time, though, because like any medication, it can react with other medications.Bromelain is an enzyme found in pineapples. You can find it in natural health stores in capsule form.Try 500 milligrams four times a day for a day or two before your surgery and a few days after. Be sure to ask your doctor if this dosage is safe for you.Use quercetin along with the bromelain. This is a plant flavonoid that can be found in capers, apples, red onion, citrus fruit, and leafy green vegetables, or in the form of a supplement. Take this with the bromelain to help reduce swelling and bruising."
"
Apply light pressure to the site of operation.,
Apply a cold compress to the area during the first 48 hours.,
Elevate the affected area.,
Use heat after two days have passed.,
Get some rest to help speed up your recovery.,
Eat foods rich in vitamin K. Vitamin K is a natural coagulant; having a deficiency can lead to thin blood, which can lead to bleeding.Eating foods rich in Vitamin K before and after your surgery can help decrease your chances of bruising.Green leafy vegetables, such as kale, collard greens, turnip greens, and spinach, are high in Vitamin K. You'll also find vitamin k in soybeans, carrot juice, and pumpkin.",How to Prevent Bruising After Plastic Surgery2," Your doctor should wrap the area when she is done with the surgery. Most likely, she will use a compression garment, hypoallergenic tape, or an elastic bandage around the area. You will need to continue this pressure for a day or two. Doing so will help to stop any bleeding and reduce your chances of bruising.Most doctors will provide you with something to use as compression on yourself post-surgery. Ask your doctor if she will be providing a compression garment or tape or if you will need to buy something appropriate.However, if the bleeding has already stopped under the skin, you do not need to apply pressure to the area, as it will not help., Press an ice pack against the site of operation during the first 48 hours after your surgery. Doing this can help to constrict blood vessels in the area, which will slow down the bleeding process and reduce your chances of bruising. Hold the ice pack against the site for 10 to 20 minutes.Do not apply the ice pack directly against your skin. Wrap it in something, like a washcloth, so that it doesn't make the area too cold. Don't leave it on for more than 15 to 20 minutes.

, Elevating the spot where you had your surgery done can help to relieve any strain being placed on the site, which can reduce your chances of bruising. It also helps blood not pool in that area. To elevate it, rest the part of your body on a pillow above your heart if possible. If you had surgery on your face, try extra pillows at night to lift up the top half of your body., Once you're two days past your surgery, you should switch to using heat. Heat will increase blood flow to the area, helping to remove blood that has pooled under the skin.Try a washcloth bathed in warm water or a heating pad. However, make sure to put a towel between yourself and the heating pad so that you don't make the site too warm, as you may burn yourself. Don't leave it on for more than 15 to 20 minutes at a time.

, After your plastic surgery you should try to rest in order to make the healing process go more quickly. Exercise can cause complications that can lead to bruising. Avoid activities that elevate your heart rate and blood pressure for one to two weeks after your surgery, such as cardio workouts.,"

Watch out for unusual behavior.,
Watch out for a person who does risky activities.,
Take note if someone has a bad track record of destroying property.,
Keep track of nervous or confused behaviors.,
Keep track of how often the suspected person misses work.,
Do not accuse anyone of being an addict.,
Keep track of the suspected abuser’s behavior.,

Educate your employees about the signs of drug abuse.,
Teach stress management.",How to Handle an Employee with Substance Abuse Issues," There are an array of symptoms that might point to a person being on drugs, because it will depend upon the drug and its properties. For some, drugs will make them drowsy, relaxed, and happy. Other people who abuse substances tend to be very energetic and erratic in their behavior. You may notice that the person is always on the move but never seems to actually achieve anything. Other behaviors to look out for include:Acting irrationally or rashly, without thinking about the consequences.
Having trouble concentrating. The person may also have a very short attention span and does not stick to projects for long.
Forgetting important meetings and events.;
, Many substance abusers tend to gravitate towards risky or treacherous activities. This is because, it part, they do not consider the consequences of their actions. Because of their poor judgement, they may:Make faulty decisions.
Indulge in detrimental behaviors that may be harmful to themselves or others.
Have a lot of legal issues.
Always be out of money.

, Someone who is abusing substances may have a track record of breaking things and mismanaging items around the office. You may also notice that the person loses things a lot, or is always asking to borrow other people’s things because they broke or lost their own items.

, A person who is abusing drugs may develop a nervous attitude when they get to work. The person may speak quickly but without really thinking about what they are saying. On the flip side, the person may also talk very confidently about something that they actually know very little about., A substance abuser may miss work often, either because they are abusing drugs or are trying to hide the fact that they are high. Their excuses may be weak or lack any backing.

, If you do not have proof it is generally wise to avoid accusing the person of being an addict. This is because some psychological disorders have similar signs. Instead, if the person has not done anything specifically wrong, continue to monitor the person’s work.If you are a fellow employee and strongly suspect someone of abusing drugs, consider bringing the subject up with your boss, without accusing the person directly or explicitly. Your boss will then be able to begin monitoring the person’s work.

, Keep a written record of your observations, including dates and times. If possible, try to have a witness for each observation that you list (such as someone else who was in the room when the suspected person began irrationally yelling at a co worker for something that the suspected person had actually done). Be attuned to the person’s odor, whether his or her eyes are glassy, speech issues, and whether they appear drowsy., If you think a person may be under the influence of drugs, but you are not sure, get another supervisor as your witness, take the employee aside, and tell the person to go home. Do not allow him to drive if you can avoid it. Then:


Talk to the person the next day and ask them to explain their behavior. There may be a reason other than substance abuse that was causing the person to act the way that they did the previous day. If they can give no viable reason, go over the company's policies again and urge the person to seek help., If the person comes clean and confesses to abusing drugs (which is unlikely but possible), help the person to get the support that they need. Try to help them learn more about the resources available to them. Many companies offer educational materials and other resources to employees that are struggling with substance abuse.Create a list of treatment plans or facilities, as well as some support groups in the area.

, If you are the one that will meet with the person, do so with an observer to help keep the situation under control. A substance abuser may act irrationally or aggressively, even if you have always known the person to by a kind person. Drugs have a way of changing a person’s personality. Try to maintain a distance from the person if you suspect that they are abusing drugs but do not have evidence to prove it.


Do not try to confront the suspected abuser alone. While not all drug abusers are violent, drugs can change the way a person acts, and the person may resort to violence to keep you from telling anyone.

, If you are concerned that the person may harm you are someone else in your office, you should report the person to the authorities. Do not try to engage with the person if the person is acting aggressively or violently.


You should also try to keep others from engaging with the person. If possible, isolate the person until the authorities are able to get to your office.

, If you are a supervisor or owner of an organization, you should take steps to make your workplace drug free. Create rules and regulations that are discussed with each employee. This way, when you do have a situation with an employee, you have clear steps in place to deal with the issue. One issue to think about is whether your workplace will engage in drug testing to be sure that employees are drug-free.These rules should be clearly stated and should include information about:


How employees will be terminated if they are caught with drugs in the office.
How employees are not allowed to drink or smoke anywhere on the premise, unless at a company function that allows for those substances to be consumed.
How employees will be terminated if they come to work while under the influence.

, One way to ensure that you office is a drug-free workplace is to set up random drug tests. When a person is hired at your company, alert them to the fact that random drug tests can occur and that they will be asked to leave the company if any illegal drugs are found in their system. Wait a few weeks before enacting this rule. This time will allow any current drug users to amend their ways and seek help if needed.

, The consequences of abusing drugs must be made clear to all employees and should be implemented without exception. Of course, the punishments will vary, depending on your company, demands, environment, etc. Try to create consequences that are fair but serious.


For instance, you may ask a person to resign as a harsh consequences of drug abuse.
On the other hand, you may choose to cut a person’s salary if they are found with drugs.

, To help keep your work environment safe, teach your employees how to recognize the signs that someone is abusing drugs.You could run seminars for your employees, or hang up signs with the major signs that may mean that someone is abusing drugs.

, Stress is one reason that may lead someone to begin to abuse drugs. Because of this, it is important to teach your employees stress management as a way to handle stress without turning to substances. You could create a seminar for your employees in which they are taught various stress management techniques.


You should also make sure that your employees know that they can take a break if they are feeling very stressed.

Cut ties.,
Change your living situation.,
Focus on your health.",How to Get Sober in an Unsupportive Environment1," When you’re trying to become sober, one of the worst things you can do is spend time around those who are still using. You are going to be tempted to use, and your friends aren’t likely going to stop you. Misery loves company, so they will likely encourage you to relapse.


If you think your friends will understand, you could try being honest with them. Say, “I value you as a friend, but I’m trying to get sober and I can’t be around you while you’re using because it will be too tempting.” They may understand, or they might lash out on you. You may also find it easier to simply cut ties altogether by ceasing all communication.;
, If you currently reside with active users, you’ll need to find a new place to live. You’ll never be able to abstain from using if your home is filled with drugs or alcohol and people who use them. You may be leaving those you live with high and dry, but you need to do what is best for you right now.


If you can’t afford to live on your own right now or are unable to find a place, ask friends or relatives if you can move in with them until you can find a place on your own. You may also consider moving into a treatment facility or a halfway house until you are able to find a more permanent place to live.Consider moving into a sober-living house. If your home environment is not supporting your recovery, then you may want to look into a sober-living house. Talk with your doctor, therapist, or sponsor about moving into a sober-living house.

, Part of clean living is taking care of yourself. To deal with living in an unsupportive environment, you might try to shift your focus to your health and well-being. Some things you can do to keep yourself healthy include:



Eating healthy foods. Try to eliminate junk foods and fast food from your diet in favor of healthy whole foods, like brown rice, lean meat, and lots of fruits and vegetables.

Exercising. Getting regular physical activity can help to control anxiety and make your body stronger. Try going for a daily walk to get out of the house, or join a gym and pick a time to go and work out most days of the week.
Getting yourself on a good sleep schedule is also essential. You may be used to staying up all night and doing drugs and sleeping during the day. You may also be used to relying on drugs or alcohol to fall asleep. You’ll need to break this pattern and learn how to fall asleep on your own and at night.Aim for 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night. You can do things like drinking herbal tea, turning off electronic devices at least 30 minutes before you go to bed, and making your bedroom cool and dark.

Relieving stress. Being around people who don’t support you may also be stress full, so make sure that you care doing things to calm yourself on a daily basis. Try using meditation, yoga, and deep breathing to relieve stress.

"

Join a support group.,
Enter a rehabilitation program.,
Find alternatives when others are using around you.",How to Get Sober in an Unsupportive Environment2," If you can’t get support from those around you, you’ll have to look elsewhere to find it. Joining a support group allows you to talk about what you are going through, and listen to the struggles that others are experiencing, as well. This lets you know you aren’t alone, and that people care about you and what you’re going through.


Many find that attending support groups in person helps them the most, but you may find that online meetings suit you the best. Do whatever it is that makes you feel the strongest and offers you the amount of support you need. , Living in a facility that is centered around you getting clean may be exactly what you need to stop using. Everyone there is on a mission to help you stop your addiction and to feel better about yourself. You’ll have access to help whenever you need it and will be around other people going through the same journey as yourself.


One of the biggest advantages to living in a treatment facility is that you won’t have access to any kind of drugs or alcohol. You won’t be able to leave to get it, and your visitors won’t be able to bring it to you. You won’t be around it at all, so you may not be as tempted to use. You may find that if you are able to get through these first few days or weeks without using, you may not go back, even when you would be able to., If you’re going somewhere in which drinking or drug use will take place, like a family event, take a support team with you. Bring a friend from one of your meetings or your sponsor, so that you will have someone there to help you should you become tempted. Attending an event that will have what you are attempting to quit isn’t something you should do during the early stages of recovery, but you may be able to do it without caving some time down the road.


If you’re attending a party, find a non-alcoholic drink you love and stick to it. You may feel deprived if you’re throwing back water while everyone else is enjoying alcohol and that may tempt you to drink. Instead, make yourself some “mocktinis,” which have all of the ingredients of your favorite drink without the alcohol."
"
Acknowledge that it’s going to be tough.,
Prepare yourself for the possibility of relapse.,
Remember why you want to quit when times get tough.",How to Get Sober in an Unsupportive Environment3," Quitting drugs and alcohol is hard even when you have a supportive environment. Trying to quit in an environment that is unsupportive is even more challenging. Realize you have a challenge ahead of yourself and understand that it’s going to be hard, but you can and need to do it.


The most difficult part of your recovery will likely be learning how to balance everything in your life without the help of drugs or alcohol. Trying to deal with work, family, and the other stressors in your life, along with trying to stay off of drugs and alcohol will be tough, but you can do it., Sadly, going back to drugs and alcohol is a very real possibility, even if you’ve been clean for a while. The temptation will be there for a long time—if not always—and you’ll need willpower to stay away from it. Staying clean while others around you are using is beyond challenging. With the right tools, however, you don’t have to fall into the trap again.


Staying away from others who use, seeking support, and taking care of your health and wellbeing are your best defenses against relapsing. Also, realizing that you may not survive a relapse could keep you from using again., There’s a reason you want to quit. When you’re having a craving, remind yourself that you wanted to do this. Avoid romanticizing your drug or alcohol use, and get honest about what your life was like when you were using.


Write down all of the reasons why you wanted to quit in the first place. Perhaps your reasons include feeling bad about yourself, having all of your money go towards supporting your habit, health issues or the possibility of overdosing, or not being able to hold down a job. Refer to this list when you’re feeling like you might relapse and get completely honest with yourself about it."

Discuss a long withdrawal period.",How to Get over Marijuana Withdrawal Symptoms," One action that may help you with withdrawal symptoms is to gradually reduce your consumption rather than going cold turkey. In some cases, that may help reduce the number of withdrawal symptoms you have, as well as the severity of those symptoms.Discuss with your doctor the best method for getting off of marijuana slowly.
You could try reducing intake over a week or two, or for especially heavy usage, over the course of a month.;
, Exercise is a great way to deal with any anxiety you may be feeling. It can also help with depression. In addition, it can distract you from the temptation of wanting to get back on marijuana.Try exercising a bit each day to help get out some of your anxiety. You could walk, jog, go to the gym, swim, or ride a bike. You could also invite friends for pickup games of basketball or soccer.

, If you're feeling depressed, anxious, or restless, meditation or deep breathing can help you deal with those feelings. Meditation helps you focus on your body and bring you back into the moment, rather than getting lost in your thoughts.For a simple meditation, try deep breathing. When you feel yourself getting anxious or stressed, take a moment to close your eyes. Breathe in slowly through your nose to the count of four. Hold your breath for four counts, and then breathe out slowly to the count of four. Repeat the exercise until you feel some of your stress leave.

, As noted, depression is one of the most common forms of withdrawal symptoms. To help deal with that, you may need a medicinal boost for a few months. An antidepressant may help perk you up and make the withdrawal symptom have less effect on you.Be honest with your doctor about why you want the antidepressant. Your doctor needs to know that you may still have marijuana in your system. Don't worry; privacy laws protect you from prosecution even if you live in a state where marijuana use is still illegal. The one exception to this rule is that if your doctor thinks you may be participating in abuse or neglect in connection with your marijuana use, they may report it to the police., If you are having consistent problems with sleeping, then a sleep aid may be appropriate. An over-the-counter aid may be sufficient, but talk to your doctor about what the best option is for you. Your doctor may be willing to give you a prescription sleep aid you can take just for the first week or so of withdrawal., You're likely to feel more irritable than normal when withdrawing from marijuana. That can cause you to snap at people if you're not careful. Pay attention to your emotions, and when you start getting angry or irritable, take steps to change the situation.For instance, you could take several deep breaths or count to ten to calm down.
You could also walk away from the situation. Tell the person you need a few minutes to calm down.
Discuss what's going on with your friends and family so that they know why you may be angrier.
Apologize when you make a mistake. You're bound to snap at someone, and when you do, be sure to apologize.

, When stress and anxiety start to overwhelm you, take time to do something you enjoy that relaxes you (not smoking marijuana, of course!). Taking time out just for yourself can help relieve these symptoms and make you feel better overall.


For instance, take a relaxing, hot bath with candles.You could also read a novel or spend some time baking or gardening.

, Acetaminophen/paracetamol (Tylenol) or NSAIDS like ibuprofen and naproxen sodium (Advil, Motrin, Aleve) can help with some of the withdrawal symptoms of marijuana. For instance, they can help with any pain or headaches you may experience, as well as the sweating and fever.Make sure to follow the recommended schedule for taking acetaminophen, as taking too much can cause liver damage.

, Some people experience nausea while withdrawing. If you are having that problem, you can start by trying over-the-counter stomach medications, such as calcium carbonate (Tums) or bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol).


If those medications don't work for you, you may need to have prescription medications. If so, talk to your doctor., Nausea can often be worsened by food smells. One way you can work on this problem is to ask someone else to cook for you. If that's not feasible, try sticking to foods you can eat cold for a while, as they won't smell as much., If you're having issues with congestion, an antihistamine may be able to help with that issue. Many antihistamines are available over-the-counter, and you can take any one that you find beneficial.Antihistamines come in traditional formulas that can make you drowsy (such as diphenhydramine) and non-drowsy formulas, such as loratadine (Claritin), fexofenadine (Allegra), and cetirizine (Zyrtec).

, The sweating can cause you to lose more water than you normally do, making you dehydrated. Dehydration can make the muscle spasms and aches worse, so make sure you are drinking plenty of clear fluids while you are in withdrawal.It's also a good idea to skip caffeine. Caffeine can dehydrate you.

, If you have used heavily for extended periods of time, it may be helpful to go through a rehab program that supervises your withdrawal from the drug. Doing so can help make the transition easier. If you are a light user, it may not be necessary, but talk to a doctor about your options.This option can be especially helpful if you have any mental disorders that may compound your withdrawal symptoms. It can also help if you live in a place where drugs are readily available or if you've tried to quit before several times and failed.

, In some cases, taking doses of oral synthetic THC can help withdrawal symptoms.Essentially, it provides a controlled way to wean yourself slowly off of the drug, and it is sometimes used in rehab programs.Synthetic THC (Marinol) is produced in a lab. THC is one of the active chemicals in marijuana. Synthetic THC is available in pill form, and you'll need a prescription. Not all doctors are willing to prescribe this medication for people who have used marijuana heavily. However, because it is a pill, it's easier to control the dosage., While much of the marijuana will clear out of your system relatively quickly, it can take a while (months) to clear it all out. You'll need to be ready to deal with this period by treating symptoms as they come up.However, the majority of your withdrawal symptoms should dissipate after two weeks, so if they haven't, talk to your doctor again.It can help to join a support group, as other people will be going through the same things you are. They can help you get through the withdrawal period.
Marijuana has a long withdrawal period because the drug is stored in fat cells, making it more difficult to clear out than drugs that are water-soluble.

Create a new morning routine.,
Do something active.Although they are mild compared to some other drugs, you may experience withdrawal symptoms that exercise can help alleviate.Additionally, physical activity improves your health and well-being in general and may help you address some of the reasons you use marijuana.

,
Cut back on nicotine.,
Eat healthy snacks and meals.Eat lots of fruits, vegetables, and foods that are high in protein.Eating foods that boost your immune system, provide you with energy, etc.,
Watch what you drink.,
Do some deep breathing.",How to Cut Down or Quit Marijuana1," Starting the morning without marijuana reduces your amount and frequency of marijuana use each day and sets the tone for the rest of the day.If you are used to “wake and bake” (smoking marijuana first thing in the morning), then find something else positive to do when you first wake up like stretching, meditation, etc.;
,, If you also smoke cigarettes or mix your marijuana with tobacco, then strongly consider quitting.Not only does tobacco greatly increase your health risks, but it may serve as a signal to your brain that it is time for marijuana, also. If needed, talk to your doctor about the best way for you to cut back on your nicotine use.

, can help you feel better in general, as well as reduce any withdrawal symptoms you might feel.

, In particular, monitor your alcohol and caffeine intake. Be aware of how much of both you are consuming and try to make an effort to decrease it.


Some people increase their use of alcohol when they cut back or quit marijuana.Make sure you aren’t starting to drink more, as this can lead to alcohol dependency and its related problems.
Drink less coffee. The THC in cannabis can lessen the effects of caffeine on your body.So, while you were using more marijuana you probably needed more caffeine. Now that you are using less marijuana, the same amount of coffee can have negative effects on you (nausea, jitters, insomnia, etc.).
Instead, try to drink lemon or lime water, which have detoxing effects on the liver., Not only will it help calm an anxiety you may be feeling, but it will also improve your lung function. A few times a day, practice taking a few deep, slow breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth.

"
Ration yourself.,
Make it hard to get to.,
Avoid things that make you want to use.,
Explore new things.,
Develop and strengthen other friendships.Spend time with people that don’t use marijuana and/or know what you are doing and support you.,
Treat yourself.",How to Cut Down or Quit Marijuana2," Give yourself a monthly, weekly, or daily ration that gets a little smaller each time so that over time you are using less.While you don’t have to reduce your amount or frequency drastically (for example, from four bowls to one in one day), each time you use, try to use a little less and a little less frequently.

, Store your supply somewhere that is difficult for you to easily get to. This will discourage you from using because of the trouble you have to go through to get it. Additionally, the time it takes you to get your supply will actually increase the time that you aren’t using.


Put things in different places. For example, keep your lighter in the kitchen, your bowl/cigars/papers in the bathroom, etc. This way, gathering everything together will make you have to take even longer to get started.

, Decreasing your exposure to triggers will make it easier for you to limit your use of marijuana. Although it doesn’t have to be forever, distance yourself for a while from people, situations, and places you associate with using.Let your friends that do use marijuana know what you are doing and that you are still friends, but you might be seeing less of them. For example, try saying, “Hey, guys, I’m not toking as much these days, so I might not be around as much. I still wanna hang out, but sometimes I’ll be doing other things.”
Don’t go to places where you are used to using marijuana (parties, shows, clubs, parks, etc.) as often. Although, this may be impossible (for example, if you are used to using at home), try to avoid the places that you associate with marijuana use or at least go there less often.

, Limit your use by filling your time with new activities. This will help distract you from using marijuana. Fill the time that you would have filled with marijuana with new hobbies and activities.Think about the things you’ve been wanting to do, and do them; learn a new language, try a new sport, take a class, or join a club.

, The more time you spend with people who don’t use marijuana, the less marijuana you are likely to use. These relationships can also serve as a support system, as well as improve your sense of connectedness, and expose you to new things.

, Limiting your marijuana intake will be easier if you celebrate your successes, no matter how small. Rewarding your efforts is a good way to encourage yourself, as well as distract yourself from using marijuana.

The reason why you want to change should also direct whether you choose to cut back or quit. For example, if you are having issues with breathing, you probably want to quit altogether. If you are trying to save money for a vacation, you may just want to cut back.

, Think honestly about all of the various areas of your life: financial, health, social, career, mental, emotional, etc. How is marijuana use influencing what you do, where you go, etc.?


Think about how much money and time you spend on marijuana. Not only will this put your use in perspective, but it will also help you monitor your progress cutting down or quitting.Consider if there are times you can’t be around certain people or can only be around other people because of your marijuana use.

It can also help you examine and address the underlying reasons for your use.


Keep a log or graph of your use. This visual reminder can show your progress, times when you are struggling, and serve as a general reminder of what you are doing.
Write about your struggles. When you slip and use again (or use too much), write about it. Explore where you were, what you were doing, who you were with, how you were feeling, etc.

Beware of missing cleaning products, rags, paint, and other chemicals.",How to Get Help for Someone Abusing Inhalants," One of the easiest ways that you can help someone is to prevent any inhalant abuse in the first place. Be proactive with your children, for example, and warn them about the dangers of huffing. They should know just how dangerous these substances are.Include inhalants when you talk to children and loved ones about drug abuse in general, along with drugs, tobacco, and alcohol. Inhalants are chemicals but can have drug-like effects.
Let your kids know that inhalants can kill them suddenly, quickly, and easily. In fact, 22% of all deaths occur to people inhaling for the first time.In addition, tell them that huffing can cause damage to the lungs, liver, and brain.
Model the proper use of chemicals for your children, too. Teach them that these are poisons and have to be handled with care.;
, If you think that a child, teen, or someone else you know is using inhalants, seek professional help. An expert can fill you in on the possible symptoms and effects of inhalant abuse as well as suggest options for getting your loved one treatment.Try calling the National Inhalant Prevention Coalition at 1-800-269-4237. They can tell you what services might be available in your area.
You might also try the National Drug and Alcohol Treatment Referral Service or the National Clearinghouse for Alcohol and Drug Information at 1-800-662-HELP and 1-800-729-6686, respectively.

, Another option is to look for a treatment facility on your own, in your neighborhood. Inhalant abuse doesn’t always respond well to treatment, but it is always better to take action. Try the internet or make telephone and personal inquiries.If you are looking online, try the US government’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration website. Search for their treatment facility locator function.Call or visit other mental health and rehab facilities in your area to see whether they are able to treat inhalant abuse. Not all centers can, due to the high rates of relapse and the long period needed for detox (30 days or more).

, You can also consider holding an intervention, for a child, teen, or older user. You’ll want to be pretty positive that the person is abusing inhalants before taking this step. However, interventions are effective at making drug users own up to the effects of their use on friends and family. They can be a first step in getting treatment.First of all, get a group of people together who will participate. This might only be parents or siblings in case of a child or teen. You might want friends or other loved ones if the huffer is older.
Formulate a treatment plan. You should have a clear action plan ready when you intervene, such as having the person go to rehab, get therapy, or start an outpatient addiction program.
For older users, you should also be ready to present clear consequences for refusal. This may be difficult, but it can force the user to see that loved ones will no longer enable the behavior. You may not need such consequences if the inhalant abuser is your child or teen, however.
Finally, hold a meeting and confront the user, lovingly but firmly. You can bring prepared statements, if you like, or even have an intervention specialist on hand. A lot depends on the user and the user’s situation.

, If you ever find someone huffing and in a state of crisis, you should above all stay calm. Try to make sure that the user remains conscious and gets help as soon as possible. Above all, do not panic.Someone who is high on inhalants usually appears drunk or in a stupor, with slurred speech and disorientation. The pupils may also be dilated.Inhalant abusers can also show exhaustion and an inability to focus. Since the chemicals impair judgement, they may engage in risky or irresponsible behavior.
Other signals that someone is having an emergency due to inhalant use include seizures, unconsciousness, coma, or cardiac arrest.

, Strange as it may seem, stress and activity can pose a very real danger to huffers and can even cause sudden death – this is called Sudden Sniffing Death Syndrome. Try as much as you can to stay calm and ensure that the inhalant user remains calm. Watch for signs of physical agitation and prevent them.Sudden Sniffing Death Syndrome can be induced by stress, agitation, and activity and can lead a huffer to have hallucinations, become violent, or even go into cardiac arrest. Avoid loud or sudden reactions.
Do not excite, abuse, or yell at someone who has been huffing. Instead, talk to them gently and try to find out what kind of chemicals are present. Look for clues: rags, bottles, or spray cans.

, Make sure that someone who is an huffing-induced crisis has access to fresh air. Inhalants are breathed in and enter the bloodstream through the lungs, affecting the brain. It is therefore important to remove a user from the chemicals, so that they can exit the body as quickly as possible.If the person is conscious, move into a well-ventilated room and keep calm until help arrives.
If unconscious and unresponsive, turn the person on his or her side and wait there until help arrives. This position will allow the huffer to breathe and prevent suffocation in case of vomiting., Whether or not the user is conscious and responsive, you should get help in an emergency situation. Inhalant use is very dangerous and can lead to violent reactions and sudden death. Don’t hesitate to call emergency services.In case the user is unconscious, unresponsive, having seizures, or not breathing, call 911 as soon as you can. If the user is conscious, consider calling Poison Control at 1-800-222-1222.
You can also call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-TALK. The hotline doesn’t just cover suicide and can put you in touch with some nearby to help you., To help someone who is using inhalants, you should ideally recognize the signs as soon as possible. Huffing can cause all sorts of behavioral changes that may be giveaways. Keep on the lookout for these – they may be obvious or subtle.Does the person show general signs of possible drug abuse, for example, like falling grades, changes in friends or grooming, or unexplained weight loss or loss of appetite?
Does the person sometimes seem dazed, dizzy, or confused? Inhalant users will show physical signs resembling drunkenness. Chronic huffers may also be nervous, agitated, excitable, and restless.
Have you ever seen the person sitting with a pen or marker near the nose? Or, perhaps the person frequently smells a clothing sleeve? These are giveaways, as well.

, Look for traces of inhalant use, too, if you suspect that someone you know is using. The habit often leaves smells and stains either on huffers’ clothing or on their bodies. Note any strange signs there, too.Pay close attention to the person’s clothing. Do you smell anything strange, particularly the scent of chemicals? Do you see smudges of ink, paint, or other products on the person’s face, hands, or clothing?
Be aware of the person’s breath, too: peculiar bad breath can be a sign that someone is using inhalants.

, Apart from behavior, smell, and stains, take notice of the person’s physical appearance. Huffing can show itself in the face and eyes, for instance. You might also find clues in the person’s general state of health.Does the person frequently have or complain of a sore throat or mouth? Does he or she have a chronically runny nose and cough? The chemicals in inhalants irritate these parts of the body.
Huffers may also have watery, glazed, or runny eyes with dilated pupils.
Look for blisters or sores around the mouth, too, as well as facial rashes. All of these are caused by exposure to chemicals., You may be able to confirm that someone is using inhalants by tracing the substances – the chemicals themselves. This is easier if you live with the possible huffer. Watch over the chemicals in your house, including paints, markers, aerosols, nail polish, propane, and others. Note anything that goes missing.Ask yourself if certain chemicals seem to be running low or are being used too quickly. Also note if chemicals go missing.
Have you ever found stashes of empty cans, used rags, or plastic bags? This is another telltale sign of inhalant abuse."

Take life one small moment at a time.",How to Endure Acute Withdrawal from Opiates (Narcotics)," These medications include acetaminophen, ibuprofen or naproxen, and they will help you to manage the body aches that you are going to feel during withdrawal. The small aches that you've been handling easily with narcotics are going to feel magnified as the drugs leave your system. Ibuprofen and naproxen are both NSAIDs which work very similarly and if you mix them, remember each contributes towards the maximum dose of any NSAID (dosing for acetaminophen would be independent).;
, Sedating antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) or meclizine (Dramamine II) will help you to conquer the nausea and sleep through a lot of the queasiness.

, Your best choice is loperamide hydrochloride (Imodium AD). While this medication is structurally similar to the opioid meperidine (Demerol), loperamide doesn't cross the blood/brain barrier.


By acting on the opioid receptors in your intestines, loperamide will stop intestinal spasms and the diarrhea that comes with them. The medication moves food more slowly through your gut and increases water absorption. Many people report that this medication is the most important key to easing withdrawal symptoms.
Only take loperamide if you need it, but take double the suggested dose on the package. Remember, your intestines are used to a barrage of narcotics. A normal dose simply isn't going to be as effective.
Skip loperamide if you are pregnant, if you have colitis or if you have a high fever of F 100.4 (38 C) or more. Also, don't take it if you start to notice blood or mucus in your stools., You definitely don't want to run out of medication and have to walk or drive yourself to the store in full withdrawal mode.

, Clonidine a non-opiate, non-addictive blood pressure medication not to be confused with the addictive anti-anxiety medication Klonopin. Clonidine inhibits your body's sympathetic response and helps decrease the sweating, chills, anxiety and restlessness that you may feel during withdrawal.


Side effects include dry mouth, sleepiness and, for some, insomnia. Your blood pressure will drop, so if you already have low blood pressure or fainting spells, you should definitely talk to your doctor. Also, be careful when you stand up quickly. Many people who take blood pressure medication ""see spots"" and feel dizzy when they suddenly change positions.
Clonidine does have the potential for physical addiction even though it doesn't remotely provide the euphoria you can get from narcotics. Try to maintain a low dosage: Take between 0.1 to 0.3 mg of Clonidine, 2 to 3 times daily.

, Suboxone is a long-lasting partial opioid agonist that blocks withdrawal symptoms.


""'Advantages':""., Suboxone is available by prescription, which means that you won't have to go to the methadone clinic., You may find it's easier to kick than methadone, and if you quit using other drugs, suboxone can help you feel normal pretty quickly. You can take it once in the morning, and you'll feel fine until the next morning.

Disadvantages: You will have withdrawals from suboxone, although for some people they will be less severe and of shorter duration. Suboxone can also be expensive as doctors must have special training to prescribe it, and they can only have so many patients who take suboxone at one time. Also, no generic version of suboxone is available in the US
Buprenorphine has both agonist, and antagonistic properties. Because of the antagonistic properties, as opposed to a pure agonist like methadone, approximately 10 percent of patients do not respond well to this medication.
Wait until the half-life of your opioid of choice has passed before you take suboxone. If you do not, you will have withdrawal symptoms which can be more severe and of much longer duration than opiate withdrawal, so be very careful with these.

, These drugs can have physically addictive properties, and they can cause you to experience withdrawal.


Stick to small doses. Five mg of diazepam 2 to 3 times daily, or 0.5 to 1.0 mg of clonazepam 2 to 3 times daily, will get the job done. Don't take them long-term, and taper them off when you decide to stop using them.
If you abuse Valium or Klonopin and don't properly detox, you could experience symptoms including tonic clonic seizures and even death.

,


Share your narcotic addiction with your doctor
You can also chew some kratom leaves to take the edge off of your symptoms. However, don't make a ""kratom cocktail:"" boiled kratom leaves, ice, Coca-Cola and cough syrup. While the leaves themselves can really help to curb withdrawal, making the cocktail will only give you a new addiction and a new problem. Order kratom online in the US or Europe. It's illegal in Australia.Avoid alcohol. Alcohol is a depressant, and while the buzz may distract you for a while, alcohol can cause your mood to plummet and can interfere with your ability to sleep.

, You may experience some or all of the following:


Agitation and anxiety
Muscle aches
Tearing
Sweating
Insomnia
Runny nose
Abdominal cramping
Diarrhea
Vomiting
Dilated pupils
Chill bumps

,


Keep your tablet or TV and DVD player nearby so that you can watch some lighthearted movies.
Make sure that your room is at a comfortable temperature, and make sure that you have some soft blankets and maybe a fan. Prepare to change your sheets often because of sweating.
Wear loose and comfortable clothing. Again, you'll probably have to change clothes a lot because of the sweating.

, If you don't plan to check yourself into a rehab facility, then stay with someone who can support you during the withdrawal period., Withdrawal may take up to 2 weeks, so try to take some time off of work. If you have a family, then check yourself into a rehab facility or go somewhere where your children won't have to see you going through withdrawals.

, Reduce your doses of opioids or medications by about 20 to 25 percent every 2 or 3 days to minimize withdrawals.

, Check out your local methadone clinic so that you can gradually wean yourself off of narcotics by taking gradually decreasing doses of methadone. Community detox will allow you to go on with your daily life without checking in to an in-patient facility.

, Withdrawal can bring out these negative behaviors, which could put you in real danger. If you have a history of depression or other psychiatric problems, then do your detox under medical supervision.

, Rehab will give you a variety of in-patient treatment options:



Detox under anesthesia. With this kind of detox, you are placed under anesthesia and given substantial doses of opiate-blocking drugs. Use caution with this method because opiate withdrawal often causes vomiting, and you can aspirate or choke on vomit when you are under anesthesia.In-patient therapy and support groups. While you stay in a rehabilitation facility, you can talk to counselors about your addiction or you can spend time in support groups with other addicts.

, Try some of these strategies:


Tell yourself that your withdrawal pains are like labor pains. You're giving birth to a new you.
Write a notice to yourself that says, ""I'm a fantastic person, and I'm doing something amazing."" Post the notice where you can see it.
Give yourself a non-drug reward for every day that you make it through withdrawal.

, You may not feel like eating or drinking fluids, but your body needs nourishment and hydration. Eat saltines or yogurt or other foods that are easy on your stomach. Also, be sure to drink water or fruit juice to replace any fluids that you lose from vomiting or diarrhea.

, Don't overdo it, but take a short walk around your neighborhood or do some light housework. Exercise will keep your spirits up and will help to distract you from your symptoms.

, As corny as it sounds, you'll feel much better about the experience of quitting if you truly believe you can do it successfully. Tell yourself repeatedly that you can do this, that you're strong and motivated and capable. Try to be consistent in your positivity. Come up with a mantra or something similar if that helps you!

, You won't maintain your resolve if you're trying to quit for your parents, your kids or even your spouse. Make up your mind that you're done getting high and you're done with the lifestyle.

, Narcotics Anonymous follows a 12-step program similar to Alcoholics Anonymous to help you to navigate life after opiates. In addition to following the 12 steps, you can go to meetings to talk to people who share your experience, and you'll be connected with a sponsor who you can talk to at any time as you fight to beat your addiction.

, Steer clear of people who will enable your lifestyle and friends from your druggie days. Also, avoid dealers or anyone else who used to give you access to drugs.

, The acute withdrawal may take anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks. However, you can also experience something called Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome, or PAWS.


PAWS often mimics other psychological disorders like depression, anxiety disorder and psychosis. People often experience lethargy, fuzzy thinking, memory problems, sleep disturbances and emotional swings. At the far end of the spectrum, people have thoughts of suicide.
Get some support if you find yourself going through the symptoms of PAWS. If left untreated, the symptoms can lead you directly into relapse.

, You may find out that every part of your daily routine reminds you of the times that you took narcotics, but this will only be temporary. Also, it would be very beneficial to your sobriety to try to find new activities and new sober friends to add to your new life. These can help you down the right path. Of course, only start new things once you're starting to feel well enough and think you're up to it."

You may need to enter a detox or rehabilitation program to make sure you are safe and your symptoms are treated during the process.


To encourage the belief that you can succeed, try to remind yourself about other personal struggles you have overcome.;
, The painful symptoms of withdrawal are temporary. There is light at the end of the tunnel. Remind yourself of this before you attempt to endure the pain of withdrawal, and continue to remind yourself during withdrawal.


Write notes to yourself reminding yourself that the pain is temporary. Put one on your refrigerator and one on your mirror, or any other places in your house you frequent.
Also try reminding yourself that people endure the pain of opiate withdrawal all the time. Knowing that others before you have been successful can give you hope – you can do it, too.

, There are several kinds of pain you may need to endure when going through opiate withdrawal. These are most likely to occur around 8-12 hours after stopping the drug (peaking at 72 hours). These may include:


Agitation
Anxiety
Muscle aches
Increased tearing
Insomnia
Runny nose
Sweating
Yawning

, These are most likely to first appear 24-36 hours after last use of opiates (peaking at 72 hours).There are several:


Abdominal cramping
Diarrhea
Dilated pupils
Goose bumps
Nausea
Vomiting

, You may become dangerously dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea.You may also breathe stomach contents into your lungs while vomiting.It is important you enter withdrawal with the proper medical support to avoid these complications.

, Because one symptom of withdrawal can be insomnia, it is often hardest to endure the pain of stopping opiates during the night. Unfortunately, there's not a whole lot that can be done about this without the use of drugs.


Benadryl, an antihistamine that causes drowsiness, can be effective for some.
If nothing else works, try a warm bath and a cup of a hot, non-caffeinated beverage before trying to sleep.

, Your enduring opiate withdrawal comes one moment at a time. Keep this in mind: you only endure pain one moment at a time. Pain in the past is a memory and future pain has yet to come. Focus on the moment without thinking too much about when you will be fully recovered. Just focus on doing what you can help you to endure the pain in the moment.

, PAWS stands for Post Addiction Withdrawal Syndrome. The symptoms of PAWS may appear after the initial withdrawal symptoms have passed and can last for months. Symptoms may include:


The inability to think clearly
Trouble concentrating
Impaired reasoning
Repetitive and constrained thinking
Memory loss; short term, long term or both
Emotional volatility or emotional numbness
Sleep disturbances
Motor issues such as problems balance or slow reflexes

, This can mean creating a taper plan with your doctor, booking into a long-term rehab, or even doing a short-term hospital detox. A taper plan involves professional assistance to help you taper off of your drug of choice, so that withdrawal symptoms can be medically managed. You absolutely should not attempt to taper without speaking to a doctor first.


Attend NA groups and anything else offered for at least a year before/after withdrawal. This may help to lessen the chance of a relapse.
Look for local resources by doing an internet search with the keywords ""opiate withdrawal + help + the name of your city or zipcode"".

, Most opiate withdrawal symptoms can be reduced through the use of over the counter medications. Speak to your physician to see if using over the counter medications would be a good option for you.


Drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen can help to relieve pain.
Imodium and other antidiarrheals can sometimes help to reduce gastrointestinal problems.Take a hot bath. Add some epsom salts for an added boost of pain relief. It is not uncommon for detoxes and rehabs to have epsom salts on hand for this very reason.
Saunas can also be good, but you must be very careful not to stay in too long. When in withdrawal, your body is already weakened and you may be dehydrated; falling asleep in a hot tub or sauna can be disastrous when in this state.

, The support of understanding people can greatly aid you in your fight to endure the pain of opiate withdrawal. Spend as much time as possible with a partner, family member, friend, or all of these people at different times, as you go through opiate withdrawal. Be sure you spend time with people who genuinely care for you unconditionally; pick those who will be there for you in your time of need.If you do not have any loved ones nearby or would prefer to keep your addiction secret, get the support of a good counselor to help you endure the pain.

, Go for a jog but don't push yourself too hard if you are extremely sore. Even light stretching can be helpful. Research has shown that exercise triggers endorphins, the body's natural opiate system. Many recovered addicts have reported that exercise helped them to feel better, if only for a short time.Try listening to some music that pumps you up and helps you to continue your workout. Be sure, though, to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard!

, Spend time getting your mind off of your symptoms by engaging in highly entertaining activities. Playing video games, reading, listening music, watching a movie, or having a friend around to distract you can all be helpful.


Try to get lost in the activity you are enjoying. If possible, put your clocks away, as keeping track of time may keep you from being fully immersed in the moment.

, Eating junk foods can make you feel negative, making it even tougher to endure the pain of opiate withdrawal. As such, it is important to eat healthy foods whenever possible. Here are some examples of healthy foods: lean meats, nuts, fruits, and vegetables. , As you endure the pain of opiate withdrawal, be careful not to substitute one addiction with another. Avoid other addictive substances as much as possible while experiencing withdrawal., You thought about giving into the pain and using again but you didn't. Positively reinforce this behavior by treating yourself to something you really enjoy. This could be your favorite chocolate, something you've really wanted to buy for yourself but haven't yet, or your favorite food. Also reflect on your accomplishment and be proud of yourself for overcoming something that is very difficult , The doctor assisting you during your withdrawal may have suggestions for prescriptions you can take to help lessen withdrawal symptoms. If she thinks it is a good idea she may prescribe one of the following drugs:


Clonidine: Clonidine alters how the sympathetic nervous system functions (the part of the nervous system responsible for the fight or flight response). It can help to lessen several symptoms of opiate withdrawal, making enduring withdrawal easier.
Buprenorphine: This drug will help to stop withdrawal symptoms. However, it can be dangerous and it is important to carefully follow your doctor's instructions if prescribed.
Methadone: Consider getting treated with methadone, a less addictive alternative whose habit is easier to kick. Methadone can be effective, studies show, although depending on where you live there may be restrictions for who can get on it. Be sure to ask your doctor whether you qualify, should you choose to pursue this option."

You may also experience persistent changes in your perception after taking hallucinogenic drugs. If you have perception changes, you may see:Geometric shapes
Objects in your peripheral vision (along the sides or edges of sight)
Colored flashes
Enhanced color intensity
Trailing and strobe-like moving objects
After images or impressions
Halos
Objects that appear small or large;
, Changes in perception can be annoying or even frightening, but they aren't necessarily a sign of any serious physical damage that is life threatening.Any alterations in brain chemistry are related to how you see things, not how your body generally functions.These alterations are also distinctly different from hallucinations since they're clearly not associated with what's happening in the present moment. Changes in perception shouldn't be confused with reality.


Any serious health consequences of HPPD aren't caused by brain damage from whatever drug was used. Instead, health problems typically come from sustained depression or anxiety associated with the persistent flashbacks., You may feel depersonalized, or drastically disconnected from your body. For example, you may feel as though you're watching yourself from an outside perspective or from outside your body.This feeling of disconnect can also be accompanied by a sense that you're in a dreamlike state or that the world isn't a real place.


Like other HPPD symptoms, this can be frightening and last for an unknown period of time. But, it's not necessarily a sign of serious physical damage that needs immediate treatment.

, Sometimes people who use hallucinogenic drugs notice visual disturbances in the weeks after use, while sometimes they last for years.Since this varies by individual, there’s really no clear way of knowing how long your visual disturbances will last. You most likely won't need to treat HPPD as if it was a serious health condition. But, if you have difficulty functioning, struggle to go to work or school, or can't interact with people, you may need to consider treatment for the symptoms.


Even people who are affected by perceptual disturbances for years can go onto live a functioning lives despite the alterations. Some people have even reported pleasurable alterations in perception, with no desire for them to dissipate., If you've used hallucinogenic drugs and are affected by perceptual disturbances to the point that you can't function in your daily life, you should get help. A mental health professional can work with you to discuss lifestyle changes and behavioral therapies. Or, if you see a medical doctor, you might be prescribed medications to alleviate some of the perceptual disturbances, even though there's no cure for HPPD.Unfortunately, there's no recognized treatment for the symptom of depersonalization. But, behavioral therapies (like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), psychoanalysis, and basic relaxation techniques may help reduce symptom severity., While there’s no known cure for HPPD, there are drugs that have been found to alleviate some of the perceptual disturbances.Your doctor may prescribe clonidine, perphenazine and clonazepam.These are primarily effective because they can relax you or temporarily improve the symptoms. But, these medications could have serious long-term side effects if you take them for a long period of time.Pay attention to how your body responds to medication and let your doctor know of any harmful side effects. Also, remember that medication won't keep the perceptual alterations away permanently.

, You may want to work with a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor, to develop coping skills or techniques. This can help you manage the symptoms of HPPD and any anxiety or depression the symptoms may be causing. Working with a therapist can also be helpful if you specifically want help in managing the symptom of depersonalization.Among therapeutic treatments, you might consider:


Relaxation techniques, including systematic desensitization. These techniques can be useful in dealing with daily situations that may cause you anxiety. When practiced correctly and consistently, relaxation techniques can give you a greater sense of freedom in your everyday life.Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy. This takes a typically short-term, problem based approach to the changing your beliefs and perceptions. You should notice a greater sense of well-being by changing your thought processes.
Psychoanalysis. This focuses on understanding your unconscious desires. Psychoanalysis attempts to make you more comfortable in expressing these desires aloud, first in the therapeutic context and then outside in your everyday life., Consider the effects they could be having on your perception. Any alterations in perception will probably only continue or become more noticeable with continued drug use.This is especially important to consider when taking visually active drugs like LSD, cannabis and psychedelic drugs like magic mushrooms, MDMA, or mescaline.


You may also want to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco, or limit their use, until you've figured out how your body reacts to each substance individually.

, Take things one day at a time and try to simplify your daily routine. Try focusing on the basics, like eating at a consistent schedule, exercising, or even just listening to music. It may be easy for you to become distracted by your flashback experiences, even to a degree that it affects your physical health. By going back to the basics, you may be able to start feeling grounded in your world again.


Your routine doesn't have to be complicated. Even doing something as simple as going to bed or waking up at the same times every day can give you stability and focus your attention., You should be around people that support you as often as you can. This will make dealing with HPPD symptoms easier, since these people can reinforce a sense of reality in your life. If you don't know of friends or family that you can call upon, consider joining a support group or online community where people experiencing similar symptoms can share their stories with you.


You may also want to look for support groups that focus with managing anxiety or depression, which are associated with HPPD symptoms."

",How to Cope With Heroin Addiction or Lesser Narcotics," These drugs do not get rid of the physical pain in the sense Novocaine or similar drugs do. Rather they work by ""getting you high"" or to reduce the emotional distress of pain. It is easy for those inclined to take to this feeling of euphoria and want to continue in the state.;
, After a period of regular use (varies but 30 days might be a good starting point) it becomes noticeable that more is needed to produce the same effect and eventually the effect is gone. By that time physical addiction has most likely taken hold. The human body gets used to regular usage of a drug and when the drug is withheld for a time; physical addiction symptoms start to become noticeable. This is the the ""dope sick"" stage.

, The physical addiction of opiate drugs is very unpleasant and takes a long time (week at least) to recover from. Few willingly undergo the experience of cold-turkey detox. However, given that an addict has regular access to his drugs, he can be highly functional in the workplace or home. This is the philosophy behind maintenance or giving the drug by prescription to maintain that state of no withdrawal symptoms. Methadone and Buprenorphine in pill form are most widely used for maintenance and the Buprenorphine has been a fairly recent addition.

, Recent developments in Buprenorphine make this option a far less unpleasant experience than ever before. This if used properly can produce a tolerable detox within a week. This works best in a trained detox facility where the Buprenex is given sublingually several times a day in ever decreasing doses and supplemented by some sleeping and anti-anxiety medication. Various OTC meds are given for stomach and other symptoms. The reason for making this choice can be put in light of the following situation: given you have a high tolerance to such drugs, a legitimate medical situation calling for their prescribing will likely be less than effective since you have a tolerance. When detoxified for a period of several months, this tolerance goes away and standard dental prescriptions will again have an effect on you. Doctors and Hospitals tend not to increase the dose just because one is an addict. Therefore the real choice seems to be whether you want those pain meds to work when there is real need or not.

, Maintenance in the form of Methadone or Buprenorphine can be obtained at various health clinics public and private. Detox by Buprenex should only be performed in an inpatient setting as vital signs are monitored constantly.

, What happens after the 5 day Buprenex detox? Well, you probably will have trouble sleeping for the next 4 weeks, and you won't have a great deal of energy. Forcing oneself to exercise along with joining a 12 step support program are very helpful in this period.

, You went through all that and hopefully it was enough motive to stay clean. Furthermore A 12 step support program is the only proven method to help former addicts stay clean. This does not imply a ""walk in the park"" It requires a lot of hard work and self examination. Yet, the end result if done correctly could be the best life you have ever had.

Determine your level of tolerance.,
Go through a medically managed detox.,
Consider an inpatient rehab facility for severe addictions.,
Try an outpatient program for mild addictions.,
Be careful with your dosage during a relapse.",How to Cope with Oxycodone Withdrawal2," Your level of withdrawal symptoms will be influenced by the amount of Oxycodone you have taken in the past. Think about the length of time you have taken Oxycodone. If you have taken Oxycodone for a long time, you probably have developed a tolerance to the drug. This means that you will more than likely experience worse symptoms.If you haven’t taken the drug for very long, your withdrawal symptoms won’t be as bad.
The dosage of Oxycodone you have been taking will also determine how bad your withdrawal symptoms will be.

, Withdrawal symptoms can wear you down. A medically managed detox can help lessen the severity of the withdrawal symptoms. You will go through this with a doctor. They will slowly taper the drug so the withdrawal symptoms will not be as difficult for you to cope with.The medications they prescribe will help you deal with the withdrawal effects by helping the brain think it is getting the oxycodone, which relieves some of the symptoms.During the detoxification process, you will be given lower doses of Oxycodone over a period of time, along with drugs to help with the withdrawal. This may take awhile and usually occurs along with therapy and counseling. Drugs used for this include clonidine, suboxone, and naltrexone.
Possible side effects of detox drugs include headaches, sweating, nausea, problems sleeping, constipation, dizziness, and possible allergic reactions., You may need a little extra help getting over your oxycodone addiction. This is okay. If you are suffering from a moderate to severe addiction, you may find that going to an inpatient rehab facility will help you cope with withdrawal symptoms. The first week of withdrawal is the hardest physically, while the weeks after that may be difficult mentally and emotionally. An inpatient facility can help you deal with the mental withdrawal symptoms.For example, you can get counseling and therapy in a stress-free environment that will help you learn how to manage the mentally difficult withdrawal symptoms that may lead to a relapse. Your sessions may include talk therapy, group therapy, cognitive behavior therapy, or family counseling.
Inpatient rehab programs generally are for 30, 60, or 90 days.
Your doctor may refer you to a rehab facility, or you may find one on your own. You may need to talk to the local hospital or look online for a treatment center that specifically treats oxycodone addiction.
Some insurance companies may pay for inpatient rehab. You will have to call your insurance company to find out what your plan covers. You can also talk to the treatment center about financial options.

, Even if you have a mild addiction, you may need some extra support. Unfortunately, you may still suffer from physical and mental withdrawal symptoms that are difficult to deal with. You may benefit from outpatient treatment programs.Outpatient programs can provide you with accountability as you recover from your addition and deal with the withdrawal symptoms. They also can offer support for you during difficult times.
These programs also provide you with individual and talk therapy.

, Sometimes, relapses happen even though you are trying not to go back to oxycodone. If you happen to relapse, you need to watch how much you take very carefully. You are at a high risk of overdosing during a relapse. Your body cannot handle the same amount of Oxycodone it could before the detox period. That means you cannot take the same amount you used to.If you take Oxycodone during a relapse, make sure to take a significant less amount since your body has adjusted while you weren’t taking it.

Eat nutritious food.,
Stay physically active.,
Do meditation and yoga.",How to Cope with Oxycodone Withdrawal3," Treating your body well can make you feel even better during the detox period. Making sure that you get a healthy diet during the withdrawal period can help your body detox and better deal with the withdrawal symptoms. Nutritious food can help you keep your immune system strong, which can help with some of the flu-like symptoms. Make sure to increase your intake of vegetables, fruit, nuts, and lean meat.You can eat meals with lean meats like chicken breast or salmon, two to three helpings of vegetables, such as spinach, kale, broccoli, carrots, or green beans, and a healthy grain, like quinoa or brown rice.
If you are nauseous, you may find that fruit smoothies are easier to eat. Try mixing different kinds of fresh fruit with almond milk.
Snack on almond butter and apples, mixed nuts, or Greek yogurt.

, Though you may not feel like it, moving around can clear the fog from your head and give you some energy. Being physically active can help you cope with your withdrawal symptoms.

Practice self-care and acceptance.Remember that individuals who are dependent on Vicodin are human beings too.",How to Cope With Vicodin Addiction," If you are prescribed Vicodin by a medical doctor, the most crucial component of coping with Vicodin use is to attend your regular doctor appointments and discuss your concerns.


If you are not prescribed Vicodin, it is equally important to discuss this issue with a medical doctor. If you are worried about admitting that you are using a substance illegally and the possibility of getting into trouble with the law, discuss issues of confidentiality with your doctor prior to this discussion. In most cases, doctor-patient confidentiality protects you because it requires the doctor to keep your information private and confidential (unless you are a serious harm to yourself or others).;
, Many people are not informed of these risks when prescribed Vicodin. However, knowing the possible negative consequences of your Vicodin use can help you decide if you want to make a plan for reducing/eliminating your Vicodin use. Some of the possible risks of Vicodin use include: liver failure, trouble breathing, jaundice, lowered heart rate, seizures, and death.Discuss the side effects and risks of continuing to use Vicodin with your medical doctor.
Understand your dependence symptoms. Some signs of opioid intoxication and addiction are: feeling high, drowsiness, slurred speech, concentration issues, memory problems, lack of awareness or confusion, constricted pupils, balance issues, depressed mood, increased sweat.If you stop taking Vicodin, some symptoms of withdrawal include: dysphoric mood , nausea or vomiting, muscle aches, lacrimation or rhinorrhea , pupillary dilation, piloerection , or sweating, diarrhea, yawning, fever insomnia., Discuss different medications you can take for pain with your doctor in order to eliminate or reduce your Vicodin use. Tramadol (Ultram, Ultracet, Rybix, etc.) can be effective for the general aches and pains.It dulls your over-firing pain receptors. However, Tramadol is addictive just like any other opiate-receptor agonist.However, Vicodin is abused more than any other opioid, so perhaps the addictive potential of Vicodin is higher than Tramadol.With Tramadol, there may be less risk for addiction. It can also be unpleasant to withdraw from Tramadol if you've been taking high doses of it for a long time. Discuss the benefits and possible costs to changing medications with your doctor.

, Detoxification programs are typically medical units that can help you safely eliminate Vicodin from your body.Detoxification usually involves inpatient treatment and includes collaboration between medical professionals and therapists.


Speak to your doctor about this option.
This method is meant to ease withdrawal symptoms.

, There are several medications that have been indicated in the treatment of opioid/Vicodin addiction. Naltrexone is a medicine that blocks the effectiveness of opioids, like Vicodin, and can decrease your cravings to use the substance.However, do not take Naltrexone while taking Vicodin.Methadone, LAAM, buprenorphine, and diacetylmorphine have also been used to treat opioid addiction.Always discuss medications with your medical doctor before taking them. Do not take any medications without a valid prescription.

, Speak to a medical doctor if you decide that tapering your use could be an option for you. Your doctor may inform you of a plan to slowly reduce the amount of Vicodin you take. Never try to stop taking high doses of an opiate/opioid cold turkey; this can lead to very strong withdrawal effects.


An example of a tapering regimen would be to decrease your Vicodin use over the course of a month or two until you're only taking a small dose in the morning, and then an even smaller booster dose in the evening. Stay there until your doctor says you can quit completely. When you do, the withdrawal will be much, much milder and won't last nearly as long.

, If your use of Vicodin disrupts your daily life and functioning, counseling or mental health treatment may be helpful. Some signs you might need therapy or treatment are if you cannot stop taking the pills, are engaging in unsafe activities (such as driving while intoxicated or having unprotected intercourse), or you are experiencing or think you may experience symptoms of withdrawal if you stop taking the drug.Examples of addiction treatments include: rehabilitation programs, day treatment programs, detoxification, individual therapy, and group therapy., Harm-reduction has to do with reducing the possible negative effects of your Vicodin use. Reducing the harm of Vicodin use is associated with: reducing the severity and incidence of relapse, increasing social support and adjustment, lowering the risk of overdose, and eliminating illegal behaviors., Not following the specific instructions on your prescription including when and how much Vicodin to take can lead to dependence, serious side effects, or overdose.Avoid snorting Vicodin. Snorting Vicodin is extremely dangerous and has negative effects on your nose and sinuses. Don't snort, shoot, smoke, or do anything with your pain pills except swallow them.
Do not cut up or crush any time-released medications; they are intended to be released in small amounts in your body throughout the day - not taken all at once. Doing so can cause serious health risks or even death.
Remember that overdose can occur if you take more pills or milligrams than you are prescribed.
Discuss with your doctor the possibility of taking pills with less acetaminophen in order to reduce negative effects on the liver.

, Know that purchasing pain medication that you were not legitimately prescribed is a crime, which could lead to jail or prison time. You could have to pay an enormous fine. If you're a college student, you could lose your federal financial aid forever. There could be long-term repercussions when you're seeking a job or trying to rent an apartment.

, Many people who are addicted to Vicodin are normal people in unfortunate situations who are dependent on a medication and are trying to avoid the agony of withdrawal. Whatever the reason for your use, you are worthy and deserving of help.


Set aside time each day to do something you enjoy such as: cooking, art, writing, surfing the web, playing games, playing an instrument, watching a movie, etc.
Make sure you have adequate down-time in your day. Use this time to relax, take a bath, read a book, or do something else that calms you down.
Remind yourself on a daily basis that you are worthy of help, that working through this addiction is a journey, and that you have accomplished much simply by seeking help and reading about the topic.

Resolve to quit.,
Anticipate withdrawal symptoms.,
Assess your level of use.,
Begin tapering your use.,
Stop and avoid opiate use.",How to Come Off of Opiates1," Addiction is a complex physical and/or mental dependence on a chemical (in this case opiates), and becoming addicted is not caused by any lack of willpower; however, willpower does play a role in overcoming addiction. Having strong willpower and a commitment to quitting are key components of modern addiction recovery.The first step to recovery is to admit that you have a problem and make the choice to seek recovery.Consider joining a support group. Even if you have supportive friends and family members in your life, it may be helpful to surround yourself with other individuals who have gone through addiction or dependence and understand first-hand what you're going through.Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and SMART Recovery are popular support groups that can help you if you're struggling with opiate use.Sometimes, if people don't like NA, they join Alcoholics Anonymous groups if they agree to completely clean living. Some people find a more stable brotherhood in AA over NA.;
, People who have become dependent or addicted to opiates will most likely experience mild, moderate, or severe withdrawal symptoms.Symptoms may vary from one person to the next, but typically include:Depression
Anxiety
Irritability
Pain
Nausea/vomiting
Diarrhea
Hypertension
Tachycardia (abnormally rapid heart beat)
Seizures

, If you have been using opiates on an as-needed basis and have not been using opiates daily, you should be able to stop using opiates without having to taper down your usage.You may experience increased pain after discontinuing opiate use, but should not experience significant withdrawal symptoms; however, if you've been using opiates on a daily basis and have developed moderate to severe dependence or addiction, you may need to taper off your use.Dependence is marked by the continued use of a drug in order to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Even though dependent users may still experience some degree of euphoria from opiate use, the primary purpose of the dependent user's drug consumption is to alleviate pain, rather than explicitly trying to get high.Addiction operates within the reward pathway of the brain, leading to compulsive behavior in order to acquire and use the drug. Addiction is usually marked by drug use with the intent of getting high, rather than for pain relief.It is possible to be dependent on opiates without being addicted; however, most addicts are also physically and mentally dependent., The safest way to discontinue opiate use, especially at home without medical supervision, is to gradually decrease your usage on a daily or weekly scale. This will help minimize the withdrawal symptoms experienced after discontinuing use of the drug.There is some disagreement on how to scale back opiate use. Some medical experts recommend tapering down opiate use by 10 percent every one to two weeks.Others recommend tapering down opiate use by 20 to 50 percent every week.The percentage of tapering down drug use will vary, depending on the severity of addiction.The faster you cut down on drug use, the more likely you are to experience withdrawal symptoms. The overall duration of drug use is also a factor: the longer you've been using opiates, the slower your tapering off should be., Once you've tapered down to the minimum possible dose, you should be able to safely discontinue opiate use. Once you've stopped, it's important that you avoid future opiate use, unless recommended by your doctor.The duration of taper will vary, depending on your needs and the severity of your opiate use. Unfortunately, there is no cut-and-dry duration of taper. Consult your doctor about how long to continue tapering before you discontinue use completely.Switch to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen.If you've been acquiring opiates illegally, cut off all ties with dealers and other addicts you used to know. Removing the temptation to try opiates again will improve your chances of success.

Trust your doctor's decision.,
Consider checking into rehab.,
Choose a detoxification plan.",How to Come Off of Opiates2," If you've talked to your doctor about your opiate use, there may be a number of reasons why your doctor may have recommended that you come off of opiates. Common medical reasons for tapering off of opiates include:


Inadequate pain relief— Many people who experience chronic pain and take a high dose of opiates experience improved pain management, as well as greater functioning skills and overall mood, after tapering down or discontinuing opiate use.Decreased levels of pain — Once the pain has become more manageable or disappeared entirely, your doctor will recommend discontinuing the use of opiates.Adverse side effects — Some people experience unpleasant or dangerous side effects related to opiate use, including (but not limited to) constipation, sedation, sleep apnea, injuries (sustained as a result of opiate intoxication or sedation), and overdoseOpiate abuse/addiction — Most doctors will recommend tapering or completely discontinuing opiate use if abuse occurs or addiction develops, Although some individuals are able to successfully come off of opiates at home without medical assistance, some medical professionals will recommend inpatient detoxification for people with long-lasting or severe addiction. The advantage of an inpatient setting is that medical professionals can be on hand around the clock to help treat the symptoms of withdrawal.


Inpatient detoxification is usually recommended for people who are medically unstable (typically those whose pain is so intense that withdrawal could increase the pain they feel), have not succeeded in outpatient programs, are not compliant with outpatient medical advice, or require detoxification from multiple substances.Inpatient services are offered at hospitals and at residential treatment centers.You can find an inpatient facility by searching online, or by asking your primary care physician for a recommendation.
Inpatient detoxification typically lasts three to four days, though it may take longer, depending on the severity of symptoms.Most inpatient detoxifications are then co-administered with a 28 day rehabilitation program for complete care.

, There are numerous detox plans available for inpatients at a medical facility. Each plan has its advantages and disadvantages, and it's important to talk to your doctor and/or an addiction specialist to determine the plan that's right for you.


Medical Detoxification — This detox plan involves tapering down the dosage of opiates. Tapering is done in a controlled medical setting that allows nurses to administer any medication necessary to help counteract the effects of withdrawal, if those effects arise.Rapid Detoxification — This plan involves stopping all use of the opiate immediately. You will be anesthetized and given intravenous opiate blockers (such as naltrexone, naloxone, and nalmefene) to ensure that you do not get high on any opiates you subsequently take. After approximately four to eight hours under general anesthesia, your body goes through sudden and rapid withdrawal, but you will not experience the unpleasant physical effects of withdrawal. You will then typically be discharged within 48 hours after an assessment and medical evaluation. There are risks of complications from the use of anesthesia, however, including the risk of death.Stepped Rapid Detoxification — In this alternative plan, opiate blockers like naloxone are administered intravenously and withdrawal-management medications are administered orally, reaching the same ultimate effects of rapid detox but over a more gradual period of time. Stepped rapid detox may be less taxing on the body than regular rapid detoxification. In stepped rapid detox, you are alert and awake the whole time, but your symptoms of withdrawal are closely monitored and quickly addressed with medication.Buprenorphine — This is an opioid medication used to help ease withdrawal symptoms and help ease you off opiates. It is a partial opioid agonist, meaning you will experience less euphoria, less dependence, and the withdrawal is more mild than with other opiates. It can reduce cravings, suppress withdrawal symptoms, and block the effects of other opioids.Not all doctors can prescribe buprenorphine so you will need to find an addiction specialist who is able to do so. It comes three administration forms including by mouth, through a patch, or via injection.
Methadone — Some doctors recommend methadone treatments to help addicts come off of opiates. Methadone is the most commonly used method of opiate detoxification. In methadone treatment, you will receive daily doses of the synthetic narcotic medication methadone from an approved clinic over a period lasting around 21 days, after which you should be able to discontinue all opiate use. Methadone detox still subjects you to a painful period of withdrawal and may not adequately prevent you from using other opiates."
"
Treat mood problems.,
Take medicine for stomach issues.,
Manage pain associated with tapering/withdrawal.,
Try to rest and sleep.",How to Come Off of Opiates3," Many people experience mood swings, depression, and anxiety as they go through withdrawal. That is because opiates can affect a person's mood, and also act as a numbing agent. As a result, many people going through withdrawal begin to feel painful emotions over events that happened before or during their addiction.The treatment for this will vary, depending on your doctor's recommended course of action.


Some doctors prescribe antidepressants or mood stabilizers to help manage the symptoms of depression and mood swings.Your doctor may administer either clonidine (0.1 mg three times daily) or hydroxyzine (25 to 50 mg every four to six hours) to manage the anxiety and anxiety-related symptoms of withdrawal., Many people going through opiate withdrawal experience moderate to severe gastrointestinal problems. The most common include abdominal cramping, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.For abdominal cramping and/or diarrhea, take a 0.125 mg dose of hyoscyamine every four to six hours.This medication may not be recommended for people age 65 and older, as it may induce dementia-like symptoms in some patients.To treat nausea and/or vomiting, take either Phenergan (12.5 to 25 mg every four to six hours) or Zofran (four mg every 12 hours)., If you became dependent on or addicted to opiates while treating severe or chronic pain, you may experience increased pain during the tapering/withdrawal period. To manage this pain, try taking over-the-counter NSAIDs, which do not have any risk of dependence or impairment.Ibuprofen may be administered in 400 to 600 mg doses up to three times each day (usually taken with food); however, elderly individuals or people with chronic kidney disease, history of GI bleeding, or chronic warfarin use should not be given ibuprofen.Take 500 mg doses of acetaminophen every four to six hours, not to exceed 3,250 mg in a 24 hour period. This may be the preferred course of action for patients who are unable to take ibuprofen., Some people going through opiate withdrawal experience night sweats and insomnia, which may make it difficult to feel rested. This is caused in part by having become reliant on the opiate's sedative effects to induce sleepiness. To manage night sweats and promote a more restful bedtime routine, try keeping the room temperature slightly cooler than usual, and keep extra pillowcases and pajamas on hand. If insomnia continues to be a problem, talk to your doctor about prescribing a non-narcotic sleep aid."

Stimulate the “rushing door” point.",How to Use Shiatsu for Menstrual Cramps1," Several of the most important acupressure treatment points for relieving menstrual cramps are located in your abdominal area. Locate your “sea of energy” by measuring two fingers width below your navel. Apply light pressure to this area with your fingers, breathing deeply, for one to two minutes.This area can also help to relieve digestive disorders such as gas, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.;
, This Shiatsu point is located four fingers width below your navel, in the same line as the “sea of energy” point. Breath in deeply as you apply light pressure to this area with your fingers. Stimulating this point can help relieve your PMS symptoms.Use your fingers to activate this point. You could use your thumb, your pointer finger, or you could place your pointer finger over your second finger for more strengthen and stability. If you are looking for more intense pressure, you can use your fist., This is a pair of points located on your pelvic area at the center of the crease where your legs join the trunk of your body. Use your palms to stimulate these two points with a light pressure. This can help to sooth any abdominal cramps and discomfort.Place pressure on these two points with your fingers or palms for one minute, release, and then repeat the pressure two more times. For more intense pressure, use your fist over the point and wrap your palm over your fist to apply more weight., This acupressure point can be found on your pelvic area, exactly below the points of the “mansion cottage”. Use your fingers to apply light pressure as you breath deeply in and out."

Activate the acupressure points on your sacrum.,
Stimulate the “womb and vitals” pressure points.,
Apply pressure to the “three yin crossing” pressure point.,
Stimulate the “grandfather grandson” acupressure point on your foot.",How to Use Shiatsu for Menstrual Cramps2," Your sacrum is the bony area at the base of your spine, between your hipbones and the base of your bum. You can activate the acupressure points on your sacrum by lying down on your back and using your hands.Lie on your back and slide your hands, one on top of the other, underneath the base of your spine. Breath in deeply for two minutes as you apply steady, firm pressure on your sacrum. This can help to relax your uterus and relieve menstrual cramps.
You can also use tennis balls or small hollow balls instead of your fists. This can lead to an intense pressure so move slowly and remove the balls if you feel any discomfort or pain.To make this position feel more comfortable, you can also place a pillow under your head and bend your knees so your feet are relaxed and flat on the ground. You can let your knees fall together and relax as you activate the pressure points on your sacrum., This pair of pressure points can be found one to two finger width away from your sacrum, midway between your hipbones and your bum. Use your fingers to stimulate these points to relieve menstrual cramp pain and lower back pain.Alternatively, you can use tennis balls or small hollow balls instead of your fists. This can lead to an intense pressure so move slowly and remove the balls if you feel any discomfort or pain., This pressure point is located on your leg. Doing acupressure on your legs can help to improve blood flow to the lower part of your body, reducing any bloating you may be feeling due to PMS.The “three yin crossing” is located on the inner side of your leg, three finger width above your ankle bone. You can stimulate this point with your thumb and fingers to relieve bloating, water retention, and abdominal cramps.
Do not stimulate this point if you are in your last trimester of pregnancy, or within the 8th and 9th months of pregnancy.

, These pressure point can help relieve your abdominal cramps, even though it is located in your foot! The “grandfather grandson” point is located in the arch of the inside of your foot, a thumb’s width from the ball of your foot. Use your fingers to apply light pressure to this point. Make sure you are pressing just to the side of the your shin bone, not directly on your shin bone."

Confirm the Shiatsu practitioner’s credentials before you book the appointment.,
Do not eat a heavy meal before the session.,
Focus on relaxing your muscles during the session.,
Rest for at least one hour after the session and drink lots of water.",How to Use Shiatsu for Menstrual Cramps3," Keep in mind Shiatsu is an unregulated therapy in the UK, but it is regulated in the US and Canada. You can ask the practitioner if they have a license to practice and if they belong to an Shiatsu society group or association, as many of these associations require extensive training and certification to join.Look up the practitioner online to confirm her credentials and to read reviews of her services to ensure she is highly recommended.
You should also share your full medical history with the practitioner. This will allow her to tailor the session to your medical history and your body.

, Try to have a light snack one to two hours before your session but avoid a heavy meal as this can make the session uncomfortable for you., Shiatsu works more effectively when your muscles are relaxed, as this allows your acupressure points to respond to the practitioner., The effects of Shiatsu can occur after the session is done. Staying hydrated after the session by drinking water will allow your body to flush out any toxins."

Eat light and avoid complex carbohydrates.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Warm up.,
Do some dynamic stretching.,
Slow down and take some deep breaths.,
Press into your side with your hand.,
Check your posture.,
Replenish your body’s fluids and electrolytes.,
Stop and stretch.,
Muscle through it.,
Work your core.,

Do cardio workouts regularly.,
Keep a food log.",How to Prevent Side Aches," One thing that can cause side aches as you run is running with the wrong kinds of food in your stomach.


Before vigorous exercise, eat a light breakfast that is low in fiber and fat content.Foods and fluids that require more blood flow to digest like complex carbohydrates are thought to draw blood away from the diaphragm, which could lead to side aches.;
, Another possible cause of side aches is dehydration. Make sure to stay well hydrated before and during your run.


After hydrating well the night before, drink 16 – 20 oz (.5 – .6 liters) of water forty-five minutes before you begin your run.Drink small amounts of water (2 – 4 oz or 65 – 125 ml) periodically throughout your workout to prevent dehydration-based side aches from developing.

, Getting your body ready to exercise can go a long way toward preventing injury as well as staving off side aches.


Start with a gentle walk for three to five minutes. Walking takes your body through a range of motion that is similar to that of jogging without placing undue stress on your body before it’s ready.Jog in short bursts. After a few minutes of walking, add a few brief bouts of jogging, commonly referred to as adding “strides.” Jog for 60 – 100 meters then decelerate back to a walk.

, Static stretching, or sitting in place as you stretch, can actually lead to injury and does little to prevent side aches. Instead, stretch in active ways like these:


Skipping for 25-50 meters then resting
Jogging backwards
Doing “butt kicks” by walking with a dramatic upswing, bringing your foot up toward your rear end.Do side twists by lifting your arms over your head and leaning to the left and right at the waist., If you find yourself on a run when a side ache sets in for instance, decrease your pace.


Focus on establishing a breathing pattern in which you inhale for three steps and exhale for two.Push your stomach out as you inhale and relax it as you exhale.

, You can relieve some side ache pains simply by putting pressure on the area with your hand.Press just below your ribs on the side that aches using four fingers.
Add pressure as you exhale to help ease the pain.

, Running with poor posture can put pressure on your diaphragm and lead to side aches.


Make sure to run standing upright so you can breathe easily.
People who run with a curve to their back are more susceptible to side aches as they exercise., Your body may be cramping due to a lack of fluids or nutrients it needs to fuel you.Hydrate regularly throughout your run to stave off dehydration.
Drinking sports drinks like Gatorade can replenish both fluids and electrolytes.

, You may find that nothing you do on the move is working to curb your side ache. If that's the case, you may need to stop for a minute to stretch. Stretching your core in particular can help alleviate the stress on your diaphragm that may cause side aches. One effective stretch you can do is to:


Put your arms above your head and inhale while expanding your stomach.
Exhale slowly as you lower your arms and bend at the waist toward the ground.
Let your arms dangle for a moment, then stand upright with your arms above your head again as you stand., While side aches can be extremely painful and make it difficult to complete your workout, there are times when stopping to stretch simply isn't an option. If you find yourself in a situation where slowing down or stopping isn't feasible, you can push through the pain.Although side stitches are painful, you are extremely unlikely to cause an injury by continuing your workout.
Continue to exercise until you have an opportunity to slow your pace and your breathing, then allow yourself to recover.

, Studies show that people with strong abs are less susceptible to side aches than those who don’t regularly work their core muscles.Incorporate doing sit-ups or crunches into your regular workouts to develop strong abdominal muscles.
Doing planks, by placing your elbows and toes on the floor, then lifting your body up (like the up-position when doing pushups) is another way to strengthen your core muscles.

, Sometimes a stitch in your side can be caused by having too much bounce when you run. This may be because your organs are straining their connective tissue as they bounce around inside of you, as well as affecting the connective tissue attached to your diaphragm.Next time you run, pay attention to your stride. Are you pushing yourself too high off the ground as you run, or is your stride too long, causing you to bounce? To minimize bounce, try the following:Try hitting the ground with your heel instead of landing on the balls of your feet.
Watch where your foot is in relation to your knee when it hits the ground. Is your foot farther out than your knee? Try to land your foot on the ground when it is positioned right under your knee.
Shorten your stride. Count how many times your right foot hits the ground during a minute of running. If it is under 90, your stride may be too long.
Visualize that you are running somewhere with a ceiling that is just a few inches above your head, and if you bounce too high you will hit your head.
Talk to a personal trainer or running coach about how to work on your stride if you are struggling.

, People who run often are less likely to suffer side aches for various reasons.


Once you’re accustomed to running, you may learn to adjust your pace and breathing patterns to better avoid developing a side ache.
Frequent exercise will strengthen your core muscles that may alleviate side aches.

, Some foods are known to make a runner more prone to suffering side aches, but everyone is different so keep track of what you eat and how it affects you.Fruit juices have been known to cause side aches in some people as they run.If you experience unusually painful side aches or experience them frequently, look at what you ate that day and consider removing things from your diet.

Drink more water.,
Stretch or exercise your muscles before bed.,
Consume more calcium and potassium.,
Drink pickle juice.",How to Prevent Muscle Cramps1," Proper hydration is key to preventing muscle cramps. If you're prone to muscle cramps, you may not be getting enough water. Work on upping your water intake throughout the day.Start off your day with a glass of cold water.
Carry a water bottle with you to work or school. Sip it throughout the day.
Take advantage of water fountains. Each time you see a water fountain, stop and take a sip.
If you dislike the taste of plain water, try flavoring water naturally with fruit and vegetables.;
, Many people experience cramps in bed. If you're prone to leg cramps during the night, make sure to give your legs a good stretch before getting into bed.Some light exercise before bed can also help stretch muscles and prevent cramps. Go for a light jog or walk before bed or ride a stationary bike for a few minutes.

, A lack of calcium or potassium in the diet can potentially cause muscle cramps. Upping your intake of both may help prevent cramps.Go for low-fat dairy to increase your calcium intake. Opt for things like yogurt and skim milk.
To get more potassium, get foods like turkey, bananas, potatoes, and orange juice.

, While further studies are needed to confirm this, some evidence indicates drinking pickle juice can help with muscle cramps. It's possible that pickle juice affects nerves in the stomach and throat, which can send out signals that disrupt muscles and cause cramps. If you don't mind the taste of pickle juice, you could try drinking it to see if it lessens cramping."

Warm up before a workout.,
Stretch your calves.,
Target your hamstrings with stretches.,
Stretch your quads.,
Cool down after a workout.,
Avoid swimming until you've resolved issues with cramps.",How to Prevent Muscle Cramps2," You should never jump into a strenuous workout without a warm up. This will greatly increase your risk of a muscle cramp. To prevent cramps, do a light warm up before engaging in a full workout.Warming up means engaging in light physical activity for five to 10 minutes before you begin a vigorous workout.
Warm up activities are usually slower versions of your main form of exercise. To warm up for a run, for example, walk briskly for five minutes.

, Before aerobic activities, such as running, make sure to give your calves a good stretch. This can reduce the risk of cramping in this area.Place one leg in front of another and then lean against a wall.
Bend the knee of your leg closer to the wall. While you do this, stretch your back leg behind you and point the heel towards the floor. Hold this stretch for at least 20 seconds. Any less than 20 seconds will not be enough time for your calf muscles to stretch out.
Repeat with the other leg.

, You should also stretch your hamstrings if you do any exercises that use those muscles. To start, sit on the ground with your back straight and stretch both legs out in front of you.Place your hands on the floor with the palms facing downward.
Slide your hands forward until you feel a stretch. Then, hold this for 30 seconds.

, Your quads should be stretched before any workout that uses them. To start, stand next to a wall or chair and hold onto it for balance.Lift up one foot, moving your heel towards your buttocks, and then grab your heel with your hand.
Hold this position for 30 seconds. Then, repeat with the other leg.

, After a workout, you should have a period where you cool down before stopping. A cool down involves engaging in slightly less strenuous exercise for five to 10 minutes. It's essentially the same as warming up, but you do it after finishing a workout.For example, you can walk for 10 minutes after a run or do some slow swimming for five minutes after an intense swim.

, It can be very dangerous to swim if you're at risk for a muscle cramp. Therefore, you should avoid swimming, especially in large bodies of water like the ocean, until your muscle cramps are infrequent. If you're having severe cramps with no apparent cause, talk to your doctor before you attempt swimming.

See a doctor under certain conditions.,
Try anti-inflammatory medications.,
Apply heat or cold.",How to Prevent Muscle Cramps3," Muscle spasms are usually not a sign of a serious medical issue. However, under some conditions, medical intervention is necessary. See a doctor if your muscle cramps: do not have an obvious cause, like strenuous exercise; are severe; last for a long time; or happen frequently.Your doctor will ask for your medical history and a detailed account of your symptoms.
Your doctor may want to run some tests, such as blood work, if they suspect an underlying cause like circulation issues.

, Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications can be used to treat muscle cramps if you experience them. In rare cases, however, a healthcare provider may prescribe medication for severe cramps.If you are currently on medication, always check with a doctor or pharmacist to make sure your current meds will not interact poorly with over-the-counter medications.

, Heat and cold can be used to soothe pain caused by muscle cramps. Press a warm or hot towel over the area that's cramping as symptoms persist. You can also massage the muscle with ice if necessary."

Take an NSAID medication to control the monthly pain of dysmenorrhea.One of the mainstays of treatment for primary dysmenorrhea is to take pain medications.,
Consider taking acetaminophen (Tylenol) in addition to an NSAID.If the pain relief from NSAID medications alone is insufficient, you can consider taking acetaminophen in addition to an NSAID.,
Ask your doctor for hormonal birth control pills.Another highly effective way to treat primary dysmenorrhea is to begin taking birth control pills.,
Have an IUD (intrauterine device) inserted to decrease dysmenorrhea pain.Another form of hormonal birth control that is effective in treating primary dysmenorrhea is with a hormone IUD, such as the Mirena IUD.",How to Treat Primary Dysmenorrhea1," NSAIDs are the most effective over-the-counter medicines for pain caused by menstrual cramps.


You can purchase an NSAID such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) at your local pharmacy or drugstore. The typical dosing is 400 to 600mg every four to six hours as needed. You can also take naproxen, which does not require as many doses each day.
If you suffer every month from the pain of primary dysmenorrhea (painful menstrual cramps), your best bet is to begin taking an NSAID medication a day or so before the onset of your period, and to continue the medication for approximately three days (or for the duration that you normally experience painful cramps).
Keep in mind that NSAIDs work best when they are taken BEFORE the onset of pain. If you wait until you already have severe pain, then the medicine might not be as effective.;
, Acetaminophen can also be purchased over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or drugstore. The typical dose is 500mg every four to six hours as needed.


The mechanism of action of acetaminophen is to block the perception of pain in the brain.
Acetaminophen may be less effective than NSAID medications at combatting the monthly pain of primary dysmenorrhea.
Note that if you take acetaminophen and ibuprofen simultaneously, there is a heightened risk of gastrointestinal bleeding as a side effect.Do not combine these two medicines.

, Reducing painful menstrual cramps is another use for birth control pills, in addition to their use for contraception.


The reason that birth control pills help to decrease painful menstrual cramps is that they cause your uterine lining to be less thick each month.
Obviously birth control pills are not advised for women who are seeking to become pregnant.
If you choose to begin taking birth control pills, you will generally take 1 every day for 3 weeks, followed by one week off (or one week of ""sugar pills"").
You may also opt for ""continuous"" hormonal birth control, where you do not take a week off and go a few months in a row without a period (oftentimes you will take pills for 3 months and then allow your body to have a withdrawal bleed).

, The Mirena IUD releases progesterone into your uterus, and also decreases the thickness of your uterine lining each month.


This, in turn, reduces painful menstrual cramps.
Another benefit is that it reduces monthly menstrual bleeding!
There are a few different kinds of hormonal birth control and they can all help with dysmenorrhea pain. For example, there are hormonal IUDs, implants, patches, and injections available. Talk to your doctor to find the best option for you.

Have coke and salt and apply heat.,
Give yourself a massage.,
Brew an herbal remedy.,
Take pain medication.,
Have an orgasm.",How to Make Cramps Go Away1," Cramps happen because the uterus, which is a muscle, contracts to expel menstrual fluids. You can treat pain in the uterus like you would treat any other muscle, from a pulled hamstring to a strained neck: by having coke and salt, it helps you get your mind of things and by applying heat in some form. Heat relaxes muscles and provides immediate (if not permanent) relief.


Use a heating pad or a hot water bottle. Lie down and place the pad or bottle over the area that hurts. Just rest for about 20 minutes to half an hour and let the heat work its magic.Take a hot bath. Fill the bathtub with warm water and have a good soak.Sprinkle in some lavender or rose bath beads or essential oils to help you relax even more.;
, Another great way to relax a tight muscle is to massage it. Place your hand over the area that hurts and gently press down. Knead the area for several minutes. Try to keep your body as relaxed as possible during the process.


You can massage either your stomach or your back. Focus on the place where the pain seems to be sharpest.
For an even more relaxing experience, have a partner do the massaging. Make sure he or she knows not to press too hard.

, There are several herbs found in nature that have long been used to ease menstrual cramps. Brewing a pot of tea made from one of these herbs and sipping it slowly can temporarily relieve your pain. Check out a health food store or another store that sells herbs, and try the following teas:


Raspberry leaf. This tea has a pleasant aroma and is known to ease cramps.
Cramp bark.This relaxes the uterus and helps relieve pain.
Don't Quai. This is used for a variety of purposes because it effectively soothes the nervous system.

, Taking an over-the-counter medication is one of the most effective ways to make cramps go away. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and Tylenol work quickly to take away the pain. You can find them in most drug stores.Some pain medications are designed for the specific purpose of relieving menstrual cramps and other menstrual pain. Look for a drug containing acetaminophen.
Take only the recommended dosage on the bottle. If your pain doesn't ease up after about an hour, try other methods for relieving your pain instead of taking more medicine.

, Orgasms are known to release the pain of period cramps since they relax the uterus and release contractions.If you're feeling up to it, have a day at the spur or a day out with your friends to relieve some of your pain

Use heat to soothe menstrual pain.Applying a source of heat (such as a hot water bottle) over your lower abdomen and pelvic area can help to soothe painful period cramps.,
Increase your aerobic exercise.Aerobic exercise - things like brisk walking, jogging, swimming, or riding a bike - produces endorphins in your brain, which act as natural painkillers.,
Have sex.Yes, perhaps surprisingly, sex can help to decrease the monthly pain that comes with menstruation!,
Stay away from smoking and drinking alcohol.Both smoking as well as alcohol consumption have been linked to worse pain during the menstrual cycle.,
Book a visit with your naturopath.,
Reduce your stress.Higher levels of psychological stress have been linked to worse menstrual periods.",How to Treat Primary Dysmenorrhea2," When used in combination with a pain medication and/or a form of hormonal birth control, it can be a very effective method to treat primary dysmenorrhea.


Use heat as frequently as you would like, to ease symptoms.
Another option is to have a hot bath, if you prefer this over using a heating pad.

, It is for this reason that increasing your exercise can help to combat the pain of menstrual cramps.


Note, however, that overly strenuous exercise during your period can temporarily worsen period cramps.
Consistent, moderate exercise is your best bet when it comes to diminishing the pain.

, The hormones released during orgasm help to ease pain and improve your overall mood, so the type of sex does not matter so long as it facilitates orgasm. However, having sex during menstruation is not for everyone, so it depends on personal preferences.


If you (and your partner) are comfortable having sex while you are on your period, it can ease the pain of your monthly cramps.
It is often easier to have sex right before your period (as many people experience cramps just prior to menstruation), or in the first day or so of your period when the bleeding is lighter.

, If you suffer from painful cramps (dysmenorrhea), it is in your best interest to limit smoking and drinking as much as possible.


If you are interested in quitting smoking altogether and would like support, your family doctor can assist you in this process.
There are medications you can try that can aid in quitting smoking (such as Wellbutrin/Bupropion), in addition to nicotine replacement options that may help to diminish your cravings.

, In addition to traditional western medical treatments, there are a variety of herbal treatments and supplements that can help to combat primary dysmenorrhea. Vitamins E, B1, and B6, as well as magnesium supplements and omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to decrease painful cramps.There are also other more specific natural supplements such as Chasteberry that a naturopath may prescribe to aid with painful menstrual cramps.


You might also consider looking into acupuncture, which can also be helpful for dysmenorrhea.

, Therefore, if you suffer from a high-stress lifestyle, it is worth looking into ways to reduce this stress, and/or seeking support from a counsellor of life coach who may be able to assist you in better managing your stress.

Ask your doctor for a transvaginal ultrasound.If your menstrual pain persists (and remains severe) despite a trial of medical treatments and other options, it is possible that there is something more going on.,
Rule out other conditions that may be causing your monthly menstrual pain.,
Opt for laparoscopic surgery.Again, if your menstrual pain persists after a proper trial of medical treatments and other options, your doctor may recommend that you proceed with investigative laparoscopic surgery.",How to Treat Primary Dysmenorrhea3," It is worth receiving a transvaginal ultrasound to examine your uterus and the surrounding structures for any other pathologies (problems) that may be responsible for causing the pain.

, If your pain is unable to be resolved via a combination of medical and lifestyle methods, it is possible that there is something else going on that may account for your pain. Other conditions to be aware of and to rule out include:


Uterine fibroids - noncancerous growths in the uterus that may lead to increased bleeding and menstrual cramps.
Adenomyosis - when uterine (endometrial) tissue begins to invade areas of the uterus where it is not normally present, leading to an enlarged uterus and increased monthly pain.
Endometriosis - when uterine (endometrial) tissue is present outside of the uterus, somewhere else in the abdominal cavity. This tissue then becomes inflamed every month during menstruation, leading to pain.

, This is when small incisions are made in your abdomen, and a camera is inserted to look around inside your abdomen and pelvic region. There are certain pathologies (problems), such as endometriosis, that can sometimes only be detected via laparoscopic surgery, and that may be responsible for the severe monthly pain that you are experiencing.


If a condition such as endometriosis is diagnosed during laparoscopic surgery, it can be treated during the same surgery.
Treatment consists of the doctors getting rid of (""cauterizing"") unnecessary uterine tissue present in the abdominal cavity.
If a condition such as endometriosis is able to be successfully diagnosed and treated during laparoscopic surgery, it will likely play a big role in decreasing your monthly menstrual pain.

Drink less caffeine and alcohol.,
Exercise more.Medical studies have shown that women who exercise more have less severe cramps.,
Consider taking hormonal birth control.Birth control contains estrogen and progestin, hormones that thin the uterine lining so that the uterus doesn't have to contract as much to release it.",How to Make Cramps Go Away2," Many find that reducing their intake of these substances reduces the severity of cramps. In the days leading up to your period, ease up on the coffee and happy hour drinks. Try to avoid them entirely while you're actually feeling cramps.If you have quite severe cramps, you may want to adopt a caffeine and alcohol-free lifestyle all month long, rather than just during your period.
Try replacing coffee with black tea. You'll drastically decrease your caffeine intake, but it still contains enough to give you a little morning boost.

, Exercising throughout the month will help keep your pain to a minimum, and continuing to exercise while you're actually feeling cramps can help loosen your muscles and make you feel better.


Do cardio exercise like running, swimming, and biking throughout the month.
Add weight training to your routine, since it strengthens your muscles and improves overall health.
While you're actually feeling cramps, lighter exercises like yoga or walking can help your cramps go away.

, That means that women on birth control tend to have less severe cramps. To get birth control, see a health provider to get a prescription.


Hormonal birth control is administered in the form of pills, shots, a vaginal ring, and via other methods. Choose the one that's right for you.
Hormonal birth control is a strong drug that has side effects. Do plenty of research before deciding to take it as a way to relieve cramps.

Be aware of severe symptoms.,
Get tested for a reproductive disorder.",How to Make Cramps Go Away3," For most women, cramping goes away after a few hours or a day. For others it can be a serious problem that interrupts regular life. If this is the case for you, the cramping may be a signal that a reproductive problem is actually what's causing the pain. See a physician if you experience the following:


Cramping that forces you to stay in bed rather than going to school, work, or completing your regular activities.
Cramping that lasts more than 2 days.
Cramping so painful that it causes you to have a migraine, feel nauseated, or vomit.

, Your physician will probably conduct tests to determine if you have a disorder that is causing your cramping to be abnormally severe. Do some research on the following reproductive disorders:


Endometriosis. This is a common condition in which the uterine lining is partly outside the uterus, which leads to a lot of pain.
Fibroids. These are small tumors that can grow on the uterine wall and cause pain.
Pelvic inflammatory disease. This is a type of infection that can cause severe pain.

Stretch regularly.,
Spend 30 minutes a day on exercise.,
Avoid standing or sitting for long periods of time.,
Wear proper footwear.",How to Prevent Leg Cramps While Pregnant1," Leg cramps are a sudden tightening of the muscles, which can cause intense pain. Stretching has been shown to be one of the most reliable ways of preventing or relieving leg cramping. Focus on stretches for your calves and feet, and make sure to stretch before bed, as well as before and after exercise. Avoid any stretches that require you to lay on your back. Try some of the following basic leg stretches:


Seated calf stretch: Gather 2 chairs and a scarf or towel. Sit down on 1 chair and place a foot on the second. Wrap the towel or scarf around the ball of your foot. Begin pulling the towel or scarf towards you. You should feel the stretch in the muscles of your calf and in your foot. Stay in this position 30 seconds and switch legs.
Standing calf stretch: Stand on a flat surface wearing shoes with a firm grip, about 2 to 3 feet (.61 to .91 m) in front of a wall. Lift your arms in front of you and set your hands on the wall. Slowly lean forward until you feel the stretch in your calf muscles. To finish the stretch, walk your hands back up the wall until you are standing straight.;
, Light exercise can help improve your circulation and reduce leg cramps as well as help you improve your core strength, tone your muscles and prepare for labor.The ideal exercise in pregnancy gets your heart pumping and keeps you supple, without causing you or your baby too much physical stress.Many exercises can be done in or around your house. An easy 30 minute walk is a great way to get outside. Walking keeps you fit without jarring your knees and ankles, and gives your heart a workout if you walk briskly. It is safe throughout your pregnancy and can be built into your every-day routine.Strength building exercises, such as squats, push-ups, or leg lifts can be easy to perform in the living room or bedroom.Athletic centers often offer specially designed programs for pregnant women, such as water aerobics or prenatal yoga. These activities can help to maintain muscle tone and flexibility and are kinder to your joints than more vigorous types of exercise.Make sure to consult a health care provider before starting any exercise program.

, Alternate periods of activity with periods of rest. Make sure to take frequent breaks to walk or stretch if you have a desk job.Elevate your feet as often as possible.Putting your feet up can help to dispel the accumulation of fluid in your legs.Use breaks to sit and elevate your legs if you must stand throughout the day.Rotate your ankles and wiggle your toes when you sit, eat dinner, or watch TV., Choose shoes with comfort, support, and utility in mind. Also consider support or compression stockings. Stockings help reduce swelling, increase blood circulation in the legs and ankles, and can help prevent leg cramps.It might help to wear shoes with a long counter — the firm part of the shoe that surrounds the heel.
Wear support stockings to bed to alleviate night cramps."

Stretch as soon as you feel a cramp coming on.,
Apply heat to the affected area.,
Consult a doctor if the pain is intense or doesn’t go away.",How to Prevent Leg Cramps While Pregnant2," Straighten your leg slowly, pushing through your heel, and wiggle your toes to help alleviate pain during a cramp. It might hurt at first, but it will ease the spasm and the pain will gradually go away., Heat can loosen muscles and improve circulation. Use a warm towel, rice sock, electric heating pad, or hot water bottle.A warm bath before bed can also help to alleviate leg spasms and soothe stiff muscles. Leg cramps are more frequent at night, when fatigue and fluid accumulation are at their peak.
Try a compress made from a tea towel soaked in warm water. Wring out the excess water and wrap it around the affected area.Cold temperatures may also ease symptoms. Try standing on cold kitchen tiles to alleviate the pain., Really bad cramps (like a Charley horse) can cause pain for a few days, and that's nothing to worry about. But in rare cases, the pain may be caused by a blood clot, massaging it could make it worse or allow it to travel."

If it is a dark yellow, you may not be getting enough water.

, Massages can help improve circulation and reduce swelling, and it can be a complementary part of your prenatal care.Special concerns exist for pregnant women receiving massages. It is important to tell the massage therapist that you are pregnant so that you can be on your side during the massage.
Verify that your massage therapist is a licensed prenatal massage therapist. Some doctors hesitate to advise massage during pregnancy because there is a huge variation in training. Not all states have laws requiring a set minimum training for a massage therapist, regardless of whether or not the therapist's client is pregnant., Some research has shown that a magnesium supplement may help prevent leg cramps during pregnancy.You might also consider eating more magnesium-rich foods, such as: whole grains,beans, dried fruits, nuts and seeds.


Avoid calcium supplements.Though it's certainly important to get enough calcium, there's no good evidence that taking extra calcium will help prevent leg cramps during pregnancy. In fact, in one well-designed study, pregnant women taking calcium got no more relief from leg cramps than those taking a placebo.Be sure to consult a health care provider or your gynecologist before taking any supplements.

Stretch after workouts.,
Try soaking in warm water or using a heating pad.,
Pay attention to the positioning of your legs.,
Know your limits during workouts.",How to Prevent Leg Cramps1," Exercising, injury or overuse of muscles can often lead to leg cramps.People can get cramps within minutes or up to six hours after working out or any type of physical exertion. If nighttime cramps are an issue, be sure to stretch before bedtime, but make sure your muscles are warmed up.Stretching cold muscles can increase your risk of injury when exercising, and it is not recommended you stretch before you work out. Stretch after you finish your workout, when muscles are warmed up.Try stretches for the legs such as the calf stretch where you stand on a raised platform (like a step) and let your heels hang off the edge. The further you push your heels down, the more intensely you will feel the stretch in your calves.
You can stretch your hamstrings as you do the calf stretch by hinging forward at the hips. Be careful not to round the spine as you bend forward, as this can aggravate and complicate problems when cramping is caused by impingement of the sciatic nerve.
Quadriceps can be stretched by standing up straight, bending one leg backwards and grabbing your ankle. Push your hips forward to stretch your quads more. Repeat on the other side.;
, Bathing in warm water or the use of heating pads is often recommended to relieve the discomfort of leg cramps. Heat may help ease cramping by increasing blood flow to the area and relaxing the muscle.Try soaking in a warm bath and use a heating pad on muscles that feel stiff or tight.For some people, the application of cold can be effective in treating muscle cramps. Experiment with hot and cold and see which provides the most relief for you. Remember to always wrap ice or cold packs in a towel to protect your skin.

, To reduce the chance of leg cramping, avoid standing on hard surfaces for a long period of time or sitting for a long time.Instead, make sure you allow the blood to circulate throughout your limbs by moving and stretching your legs frequently during the day.


The position in which you sleep may contribute to leg cramps at night. Sleeping with your knees bent and your feet pointing downward may cause your legs to cramp. Try keeping your legs straight and placing a pillow under your calves to avoid leg cramps. If you are tall and have difficulty fitting on your mattress, try allowing your feet to hang over the edge instead of tucking your legs., Oftentimes, cramps are a result of pushing yourself harder than your body is used to. Avoid rapidly increasing the intensity or duration of a workout.Instead, train up to it gradually, and always pace yourself.


Signs that you are overtraining your body include tightness in your muscles, joint stiffness, or aches and pains that persist for several days.

Stay hydrated.,
Replenish sodium.,
Increase your calcium intake.,
Ensure you have enough magnesium in your blood.,
Avoid potassium depletion.",How to Prevent Leg Cramps2," Some studies have found that staying hydrated will prevent cramps (while other studies have found no correlation between the two). Researchers believe that the decreased fluid around a body’s cells causes muscle twitches, which in turn causes cramps.Be sure to drink enough water daily and replenish after exercising.


The Institute of Medicine suggests that men should drink roughly 13 cups (3.3 liters) of total beverages a day, while women should consume about 9 cups (2.2 liters) per day.The amount of fluids needed also depends on factors such as weight and activity level. Try an online calculator that will give you a more accurate estimation., Electrolytes are essential in maintaining the fluid balance in your body and can be lost when you sweat. Sodium in particular is lost through sweat more than other electrolytes. If you are sweating — especially if the weather is hot, if you are exercising, or you are an endurance athlete — the loss of sodium may lead to cramping and more dangerous condition called hyponatremia.Replace sodium by eating salty foods (like pretzels) or drinking sports products and drinks with electrolytes.
Try eating a slice of sour pickle or drinking the juice from a pickle. This is known as a “grandma formula,” but even players on the NFL’s Philadelphia Eagles have been known to drink 2 ounces of pickle juice before football games to prevent cramping.Unrefined sea salt is also suggested because it contains other minerals that are useful to the body., Many believe that muscle cramps are caused by a calcium deficiency.Increase your consumption of calcium naturally by eating a diet rich in dairy products such as milk, cheese, or yogurt. Additionally, you can try taking calcium supplements that can be purchased at your local pharmacy or online. The average recommended daily amount for adults ages 19 – 50 is 1,000 mg.If you don’t care for dairy products, try white beans, kale, sardines, salmon, or dried figs.Look for calcium supplements that also contain betaine hydrochloride and vitamin D. These nutrients help to increase the amount of calcium that’s digested into your body., There are currently medical hypotheses that link leg cramps to low levels of magnesium in one’s system.While the effect of magnesium on the general public is still being tested, it has proven an effective treatment for pregnant women.Try taking a magnesium supplement which can be found at your local pharmacy.


Suggested magnesium levels vary from 360 mg/day to 420 mg/day based on age. Talk to your doctor about the dosage that’s right for you., Potassium is an electrolyte that regulates the flow of liquids in and out of the body's cells. It also helps to conduct nerve impulses and muscle contractions. Most adults need 4,700 mg of potassium each day. High potassium foods include wholegrain breads, peanut butter, bananas, spinach, and milk or yogurt.Diuretics (water pills) that are used to treat conditions like high blood pressure, have been known to increase the risk of leg cramps because it increases the body's excretion of electrolytes like potassium."

Try a topical treatment like dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).,
Take an over-the-counter (OTC) medication.,
Get a prescription for quinine.,
Talk to your physician about leg cramps that result from other medical conditions.",How to Prevent Leg Cramps3," DMSO is a clear, slightly oily liquid that is applied to the skin to reduce swelling, inflammation and pain. Mix a solution of one part water and two parts DMSO and rub into the skin at least three times a day.DMSO comes in both liquid and gel form. Opt for the 99.9% liquid to avoid itching and irritation.
You may experience mild itching, irritation, and warmth to the affected area. These reactions are temporary and pose no cause for concern.

, There are a few OTC medications that claim to have homeopathic formulas that stimulate the body’s natural healing processes in order to relieve symptoms of cramping. Caplets or tablets should be taken with water every four hours (or as needed), while the ointment can be used liberally and applied directly to the skin.Active ingredients in different OTC products vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, so always read the label carefully. Active ingredients include Cinchona officinalis, Gnaphalium polycephalum, and Magnesia phosphorica.
Check your local pharmacy or online vendors for availability.
Always consult your doctor before taking a new medication if you are pregnant, taking other medications (including OTC medications), have an existing health condition, nursing, or administering to someone under the age of 12.

, Doctors have been prescribing quinine for leg cramps since the 1940s because there have been no other reliable medications developed. Prescribing of the drug remains high despite FDA safety warnings and little scientific evidence to support its effectiveness. Talk to your doctor about all treatment options before considering quinine.The brand name Qualaquin is the only drug containing quinine allowed by the FDA.
Side effects include cardiac problems, rashes and allergic reactions, hearing problems, eye problems, kidney failure, and more.

, Medical conditions such as diabetes, nerve disorders, liver disorders, or thyroid disorders can result in leg cramps.You can treat yourself with self-care measures such as leg stretches, staying hydrated, or medication.If symptoms persist, talk to your doctor immediately.

You can place an electric heating pad or hot water bottle over your abdomen.This can stop painful spasms. Leave the pad or bottle on for around 20 minutes and make sure not to apply it to your bare skin.


You can also relieve pain by soaking in a hot bath. Consider adding epsom salts if your IBS is making you constipated.;
, Ask your doctor to prescribe medication to relieve your symptoms. If you're experiencing constipation, your doctor may prescribe lubiprostone. If you're mainly having diarrhea, your doctor might prescribe alosetron. If you have severe IBS, your doctor might put you on a low-dose antidepressant. This can soften the pain signals going from your brain to your gut, rather than treat your symptoms.Alosetron is the only drug currently approved to treat IBS-D. It is thought to reduce colonic motility. There are some serious side effects associated with alosetron, such as ischemic colitis (decreased blood flow to the bowels) and severe constipation which may require hospital treatment. It can also interact with other medications, such as antihistamines and certain antidepressants.You can also take over-the-counter medications to deal with the symptoms. For example, take an anti-diarrheal medication., Regular exercise can help your gut contract and expand normally. Try to do 30 minutes or moderate exercise five days a week, which can also reduce your anxiety, improve your mood, and help you manage your weight.If you find that exercising makes your symptoms worse, talk with your doctor and try a different form of exercise.


Moderate activity includes biking, brisk walking, water aerobics, and gardening.Make a habit of exercising so you're more likely to do it. For example, you might try going for a jog before breakfast every day or swimming laps on the weekends.

, If traditional pain treatment isn't working for you, you may consider working through the pain. Practice relaxation or hypnotherapy to deal with the pain. Cognitive behavioral therapy is also thought to be an effective IBS treatment.It's also useful in relieving anxiety associated with IBS symptoms.Unlike medications or changing your diet, these learning pain management is free from side effects.

, Take an enteric-coated peppermint oil supplement to relieve abdominal pain caused by IBS, as well as diarrhea and bloating.Follow the manufacturer's instructions regarding dosage. Peppermint oil has long been used to calm the stomach and digestive system. This can help intestinal gas pass easier.


In addition to peppermint, you can drink herbal teas to relieve digestive pain. Try herbal teas that contain ginger, fennel, cinnamon, or cardamom., If you have diarrhea or constipation from IBS, eat soluble fiber. This dissolves in water and forms a thick gel in your large intestine which can slow down diarrhea. Soluble fiber also relieves constipation by making it easier to pass stools, reducing pain. The amount of fiber you need depends on your age and sex. The Institute of Medicine has specific guidelines for daily fiber intake. It's roughly about 25 g for adult women and 38 g for adult men. To get soluble fiber in your diet, eat:Oatmeal
Barley
Okra
Beans
Legumes: garbanzo beans, lentils, soybeans
Grits
Nuts and seeds
Fruits: apples, pears, berries

, If you mainly have constipation from IBS, gradually increase insoluble fiber (which doesn't dissolve in water). Slowly increase the amount of fiber in your diet by 2 to 3 grams a week, until you eat 25 to 60 grams a day. If you increase fiber too quickly, you may have gas. Fiber will support the bacteria in your gut which improves bowel function. To get insoluble fiber from your diet, eat:Whole grains (unprocessed): these contain both soluble and insoluble fiber
Carrots
Zucchini
Celery
Flaxseed
Beans
Lentils

, Probiotics and prebiotics feed and support healthy gut bacteria.They can also protect your gut from harmful bacteria that irritates your bowels.Since it's hard to gauge how many Colony Forming Units of probiotics (CFUs) are in foods, eat a variety of foods known to contain probiotics and prebiotics. To get probiotics in your diet, eat leafy green vegetables (kale, spinach, Swiss chard, spinach, beet greens, collard greens, mustard greens), broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage. To get prebiotics, eat:Chicory root
Jerusalem artichoke
Dandelion greens
Garlic
Leeks
Asparagus
Wheat bran
Baked wheat flour
Bananas

, Look for a supplement that has many different strains of bacteria (but at least has L. acidophilus, L. Fermentum, L. rhamnosus, B. longum, and B. bifidum). Some supplements include a yeast, Saccharomyces, which protects gut bacteria. It doesn't matter whether you take a liquid, capsule, tablet, or supplement powder. Just take a supplement that has a controlled release so that it doesn't dissolve in your stomach acid.


The brands Florastor and Align are often recommended by health care professionals.
Check the expiration date and make sure the supplement has at least 25 billion Colony Forming Units (CFUs). Adults should get 10 to 20 billion CFUs a day from a supplement.Look for a USP Verified seal which means that a non-profit lab has checked the supplement for the bacteria it lists on the label.

, Fermented foods can support and replenish the microbes in your gut. Choose unpasteurized products because pasteurization destroys the ""good"" bacteria (probiotics). While there are no scientific or government recommended guidelines for how much unpasteurized fermented food you should eat, researchers are urging global food guides to start including them.In the meantime, eat:


Tempeh: fermented soybeans
Kimchi: fermented Korean cabbage
Miso: fermented barley paste
Sauerkraut: fermented cabbage
Yogurt: fermented milk with active probiotic bacteria
Kefir: fermented milk
Kombucha: black or green fermented tea with added fruit and spices

, Follow the ""Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Monosaccharides And Polyols (FODMAP)"" diet. FODMAPs are foods or ingredients that are associated with making IBS symptoms worse. Avoid these foods or limit them to one to three servings a day. In general, you should follow a low-fat, complex carbohydrate diet.For example, eat whole grains, lactose-free dairy products, gluten-free foods, fish, chicken, meat, and certain fruits and vegetables (such as bok choy, carrots, bananas, cucumber, grapes, tomatoes).Try the low FODMAP diet for at least four to six weeks. You may immediately get abdominal pain relief, or it may take longer for the pain to go away.
Talk to your doctor about what you should and should not eat on this diet.
It is believed that short-chain carbohydrates are poorly absorbed by the intestine and rapidly fermented by bacteria in the gut. The production of gas during this process is a cause of symptoms.

, Fructose isn't absorbed well by your gut, which can cause cramping and diarrhea.Avoid fruits that have simple sugar, like apples (and applesauce), apricots, blackberries, boysenberries, cherries, canned fruit, dates, figs, pears, peaches and watermelon. You should also avoid any food with high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which may include baked items and beverages.


Don't forget to cut out artificial sweeteners like xylitol, sorbitol, maltitol and mannitol (which all contain polyols that irritate the digestive system).
You should also avoid the these vegetables which can aggravate your digestion: artichokes, asparagus, broccoli, beetroot, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, garlic, fennel, leeks, mushrooms, okra, onions, and peas.

, Dairy contains lactose which is a carbohydrate that breaks down into sugar. Lactose can irritate your sensitive digestive system. If you think you may be sensitive to lactose, you might actually be lactose-intolerant, which can also cause digestive problems like those of IBS.Try to limit the amount of milk, ice cream, most yogurts, sour cream, and cheese you eat.


You can still eat soy-based yogurts since they don't have lactose. But, you should still avoid soybeans.

, Several grains contain fructans which can irritate your digestive system. Try to limit your intake of grains that contain gluten, like wheat, spelt, rye, and barley. You should also reduce the amount of legumes in your diet because these contain galactans which may also irritate your digestive system. Galactans and fructans can cause the gas and bloating symptoms of IBS. Avoid these legumes:Beans
Chickpeas
Lentils
Red kidney beans
Baked beans
Soybeans

, Lots of fruits and vegetables are allowed in the FODMAP diet. These fruits and vegetables don't contain large amounts of the carbohydrates that your body has trouble breaking down. For fruits, you can eat bananas, berries, melons (except watermelon), citrus, grapes, kiwi, and passion fruit. There are also a variety of vegetables you can eat that won't irritate your digestive system. Try making half of your plate vegetables every meal. Try:Bell peppers
Cucumbers
Eggplant
Green beans
Chives and green onion
Olives
Squash
Tomatoes
Roots: carrots, parsnips, potatoes, radishes, sweet potatoes, turnips, yams, ginger
Greens: kale, lettuce, spinach, bok choy
Water chestnuts
Zucchini

, Get protein from a variety of sources like meat, fish, eggs, nuts and seeds (except for pistachios). You shouldn't feel like you can't eat food. Just watch to make sure these meats and grains don't have added sugars or wheat, which can irritate your digestive system. Try to choose meat that hasn't been fed grain or high-fructose corn syrup (which are high in FODMAPs). Grains that you can eat include:Corn
Oats
Rice
Quinoa
Sorghum
Tapioca

, Symptoms of IBS can be different for each person and vary in severity from one time to another. The most common symptoms of IBS are:Abdominal pain and cramping that may improve after a bowel movement
Bloating and gas
Constipation (which may alternate with diarrhea)
Diarrhea (which may alternate with constipation)
A strong urge to have a bowel movement
Feeling as if you still need to have a bowel movement after you've already had one
Mucus in the stool

, IBS is a ""functional"" digestive disorder. This means that the digestive system changes for unknown reasons. But, these changes don't actually damage the digestive system. Conditions that usually happen with IBS include:Mixed nerve transmissions between the brain and large intestine
Problems with the way food is pushed through the digestive system (peristalsis)
Depression, anxiety, and panic disorders
Infections in the digestive system
Bacterial overgrowths (like Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth )
Changes in hormone levels
Food sensitivities

, Since there's no diagnostic test, your doctor will do a physical exam. The doctor may order blood tests, stool tests, and imaging tests, depending on your specific situation. These tests can also rule out other health conditions.


If your doctor believes you have IBS, you'll probably be advised about changes you need to make to your diet. Your doctor might prescribe medications (like muscle relaxants, anti-depressants, bulk-forming laxatives and anti-diarrheal medicines) to relieve symptoms., Track the foods you eat and make note of which foods seem to make your symptoms worse. Try to avoid eating these foods in the future. Most people with IBS find that one or more of these cause digestive problems:Foods that are high in fat
Foods that are artificially sweetened
Foods that cause gas or bloating (cabbage, some beans)
Some milk products
Alcohol
Caffeine

Massage your feet and toes.,
Stretch and wiggle your toes.,
Hold a toe and foot stretch until the cramp is gone.,
Soak your toes in a warm bath.,
Go for a walk.",How to Get Rid of Toe Cramps1," You can massage the muscles of your feet and toes to help relieve toe cramps. As you massage your feet and toes, pay special attention to the arches of your feet and the muscles between your toes that run along the top of your foot.If you feel a knot in one of the muscles in your feet or toes, use your thumb to apply pressure to the knot for three to five seconds and then release.
Repeat the massage two to three times or until the cramp goes away.
You can use a massage roller to roll over with your foot. This can be in the form of simple wooden rollers to using a water bottle. You can place the water bottle in the freezer and roll over it, providing ice relief at the same time.;
, Performing a simple toe stretch followed by some toe wiggling may also help to get rid of your toe cramps. Stretching and wiggling your toes can help to relax the muscles that are causing your toes to cramp.To do a toe stretch, sit on the floor or on your bed with your legs out in front of you.
Then, flex your toes forward and hold for a few seconds. Then, pull them back and hold for a few more seconds.
Next, spread your toes out as far as they will stretch. Try to spread out your toes enough so that they are not touching each other.
Then, repeat the process of bending your toes forward and back. Spread your toes again and then start to wiggle your toes. Keep wiggling your toes until the cramp goes away.
Sometimes stretching the calf muscles can also ease off the tightness in the foot and toes. Simply stand facing a wall, positioning one foot in front of the other — the affected foot should be the back foot. Lean forward in a lunge, feeling a stretch in the calf of the back leg. Hold this position for 30 seconds. Repeat four to five times.

, If you find it hard or ineffective to stretch and wiggle your toes, then you may need a more powerful stretch. You can use your hands to help you stretch your toes and get rid of toe cramps.To stretch your toes with your hands, sit down with the cramping foot crossed over your other knee. Then, grab your toes and pull them back slightly so that you feel a stretch.
Hold this stretch for three to five seconds and then release. Repeat this stretch until the cramp is gone.

, You may also find it helpful to soak your toes in a warm bath or foot tub. The heat will relax the muscles in your feet and toes and help to increase blood flow. You can also add Epsom salts to the foot bath for some added relaxation.To use warm water to get rid of toe cramps, pour yourself a warm bath or fill a foot tub with warm water.
If using a bath, then add about one to two cups of Epsom salts to the bath. If using a foot tub, then add a couple of tablespoons of Epsom salts to the tub.
Immerse your feet in the bath or soak them in the foot tub for about 15–20 minutes to relax the cramps away.

, Staying active can help to prevent foot and toe cramps and it may also help to relieve them. If you get a cramp in your toes, try going for a quick walk to relieve the cramp.Try to incorporate a few short walks into your daily routine to help prevent and treat toe cramps throughout the day.

Perform strengthening exercises.,
Keep your toes and feet warm.",How to Get Rid of Toe Cramps2," Toe cramps may be caused by dehydration, so make sure that you drink plenty of water.Try to drink at least six to eight 8-ounce glasses of water every day to stay hydrated. If you are active, then you may need to drink more.

, You may also get toe cramps because of a mineral deficiency.One way to ensure that you are getting enough minerals is to take a daily vitamin that includes 100% of your daily value of vitamins and minerals.


Make sure that the multivitamin you choose contains sodium, magnesium, calcium, and potassium. A deficiency of any of these three minerals may cause leg cramps.Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for how to take the supplement and talk to your doctor if you have any questions about choosing the right supplement for you.
Eat a well-balanced diet as well to help prevent toe cramps. Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein in your diet., Uncomfortable shoes may also lead to food cramps for some people. Try to choose low-heeled shoes with wide toe-boxes. Avoid narrow toed shoes that make it hard or impossible for you to move your toes.You should be able to wiggle your toes in your shoes.

, Stretching your toes and feet more often may also help to prevent toe cramps.Make sure that you stretch your feet, toes, calves, and legs before you do any exercise and before you go to bed.

, You can also wear toe stretchers at night if you are prone to toe cramps while you sleep. Toe stretchers keep your toes separated from each other and help to stretch the small muscles around your toes as well.


You can find toe stretchers in the beauty section of drug stores. They are meant to be used to keep toes apart during a pedicure, but they may also help prevent toe cramps.

, Strengthening exercises can fortify the foot and tendons and muscles that act directly on the toes. One exercise is doing calf raises. Stand with your hands steady against the wall or a chair. Raise your heels up, hold for five seconds and then come back to neutral. Repeat eight to 10 times.


You can also work on towel curls. Place a flat towel on the ground. Put your foot over the towel, and attempt to roll it up using your toes. Once you do, use your toes and foot to roll the towel back out. Do this exercise about three times a week.

, If your feet and toes get cold, then this may lead to cramping as well. Wear socks or slippers around the house and wear warm socks with appropriate footwear when you go outside.


Try using a heating pad to warm your feet if warm socks are not enough."

See your doctor if foot cramps are chronic or do not improve.,
Take a pregnancy test.,
Ask about your medications.",How to Get Rid of Toe Cramps3," Foot and toe cramps may be a symptom of an underlying medical condition, so you should see a doctor as soon as possible if your foot cramps continue for more than two weeks or if stretching and other remedies do not help. Some of the conditions associated with foot cramps include:Thyroid disorders
Nerve damage
Parkinson’s disease
Multiple sclerosis
Vitamin D deficiency
Diabetes
Peripheral Neuropathy

, Foot, leg, and toe cramps are more common if you are pregnant, so you may want to take a pregnancy test if you have noticed an increase in these symptoms.If you are pregnant, then you should talk to your doctor about how you can manage your toe cramps.

, Some medications can cause foot and toe cramps as a side effect, so you may want to ask your doctor to see if your medication are to blame.Your doctor may be able to switch your medication or try a different dosage to minimize this side effect.


Some of the common medications that have been known to cause cramps are diuretics and cholesterol-lowering medications such as statins."
"
Stretch the affected muscle.,
Gently massage the cramp.,
Soak in an Epsom salt bath.,
Take over-the-counter muscle relaxants.,
Keep well hydrated.,
Don't forget about electrolytes.,
Consume more magnesium.,
Get regular massages.,
Wear comfortable and supportive shoes.",How to Lessen the Pain when You Get a Cramp," Although cramps often manifest pretty quickly, they don't happen instantaneously, so you typically have a few seconds to try and thwart them. The best strategy aimed at aborting a muscle cramp is by counteracting it with a stretch.Cramps predominantly occur in the muscles of the leg (hamstrings, calves and soles of your feet), so when you feel one coming on, stand up and oppose the cramp by stretching the muscle in the opposite direction. A cramp is a strong, involuntary contraction, so stretching helps to counter it by lengthening the muscle fibers.


For example, just as you feel your calf muscle begin to contract and cramp up, extend the affected leg behind you and assume a fencer's stance. Bend your forward-positioned leg at the knee and slowly lunge forward with both feet flat on the ground until you feel a calf stretch in the extended leg.
When combating a muscle cramp, hold stretches for at least 30 seconds while breathing deeply and see if that's sufficient. You may need to do a few more repetitions to successfully thwart the cramp.
Warming up then stretching your leg muscles prior to walking or any athletic activity may help prevent spasms and cramps.;
, A spasm is a portion of a muscle that contracts and becomes too tight, which creates pain and loss of function. However, if the spasm is especially forceful and sustained for more than a few seconds, then it's more appropriately called a cramp.Muscle cramps often cause a visible or palpable hardening or trigger point in the involved muscle. As such, a common-sense approach is to feel (palpate) for the painful trigger point and then massage the affected muscle fibers with your thumb until the cramp subsides. Sustain pressure to the trigger point, which may help release the cramp. This approach is usually referred to as trigger point therapy by massage therapists, chiropractors and physiotherapists.


Although muscle cramps occur in children, they become much more common with advancing age.
If the muscle cramp is in the sole of your foot, use a tennis ball, soda pop bottle, or small wooden roller to massage the tension away.

, Soaking your affected muscle groups (such as the legs) in a warm Epsom salt bath can significantly reduce spasm, pain, and swelling.The magnesium in the salt allows the muscles to reduce their constriction and relax. It might take five to 10 minutes to pour a warm bath and add the salt to it, so this method is probably best for chronic muscle cramps or ones that are recurring (coming and going) over the course of a few hours. However, once in the bath, the warm water and magnesium-rich salt can provide quick relief.


Don't make the bath water too hot or soak for much more than 30 minutes, because the hot, salty water will pull fluid from your body and potentially dehydrate you.
As a quicker alternative, apply moist heat to your muscle cramp — microwaved herbal bags work particularly well and are sometimes infused with aromatherapy (such as lavender) that has further relaxing properties.

, Although stretching, massage, and the application of moist heat are fairly quick methods for combating muscle cramps, taking medication can help if you're willing to wait a little longer for the effects to occur (about 30 minutes). As such, short-term use of muscle relaxants, such as cyclobenzaprine (Flexeril), orphenadrine (Norflex), or baclofen (Lioresal), can relax muscle cramps due to an injury or other causes.Keep in mind that drugs are not typically used to treat an ordinary acute cramp because most subside spontaneously before the medicine is absorbed and has an impact. Thus, muscle relaxants are better for chronic or recurring cramps.


Be careful not to take muscle relaxants with any other medications, as it can lead to unwanted side effects.
Do not drive or operate heavy machinery after taking muscle relaxants because they can trigger sleepiness and reduce muscle coordination and reaction times.

, Playing sports or being active in general (particularly if the weather is hot and humid) can cause excessive water loss due to sweating, which leads to dehydration if you're not drinking adequate fluids to replenish and maintain normal blood volume. This kind of dehydration significantly increases the risk of muscle cramps and strains.Muscle cramps under these conditions can also be an early sign of heat stroke. Thus, make the effort to properly hydrate yourself, especially on days that you're active. Aim for eight 8-ounce glasses of purified water on most days, and maybe a little more on the weekends during summertime.


As a good indicator of dehydration, take note of the color of your urine. Dark yellow can indicate dehydration, whereas an almost complete lack of yellow is usually an indication of normal hydration.
When replenishing fluids, avoid beverages with caffeine — it acts as a diuretic and stimulates you to urinate more frequently.
Some medications act as diuretics and may put you at greater risk for muscle cramps, so ask your doctor about the common side effects of your prescription drugs.

, Electrolytes are electrically charged elements in your body fluids (blood and urine, primarily) that help to maintain the normal flow and distribution of water into and out of cells.For example, sodium and potassium are particularly important electrolytes associated with muscle function and depletion of these elements is associated with muscle cramps.A deficiency of electrolytes is usually the result of excessive perspiration because human sweat is rich in salts (sodium and potassium). As such, on days that you're perspiring, eat some healthy foods that contain sodium, such as oranges, carrots, cantaloupe, artichokes, and spinach.


With excessive perspiration, drinking lots of plain water over a short period of time may make things worse because the electrolytes in your body get diluted. In this situation, drink some fruit juice, vegetable juice, or ""sports drink"" as well.
Consider sprinkling some sea salt on your food at least once a day during summer months. Sea salt use is not associated with the negative side effects of excessive use of regular table salt, such as hypertension.

, Magnesium is a mineral needed for strong bones, but as an electrolyte (charged element) it's crucial for muscle relaxation.For muscle function, calcium and magnesium work in conjunction: calcium is needed to contract muscle fibers, whereas magnesium is needed to release or relax muscle fibers. A dietary lack of magnesium (which is increasingly more common in the U.S. due to soil depletion and other factors) can lead to muscles spasms, cramps and general muscle dysfunction, particularly in the large muscle groups of the legs. As such, in order to prevent or combat muscles cramps, either supplement with magnesium (capsules or liquid) and/or eat magnesium-rich foods on a regular basis.


Healthy foods high in magnesium include: most fish, lean meats, low-fat dairy, dark leafy greens, avocados, bananas, dried fruit, pumpkin seeds.
Low levels of calcium and magnesium are common among pregnant women and likely a factor with the higher incidence of cramps.
A causative factor in restless leg syndrome during the night is a chronic lack of dietary magnesium.

, Deep tissue massages are helpful for muscle function in general because they help to reduce muscle tension and they promote better circulation, which are factors important for preventing spasms and cramps.If your cramps commonly occur in specific areas (such as the feet or calf muscles), then a focused 30 minute massage in those areas would be a good start. Allow the massage therapist to go as deep as you can tolerate without wincing. In terms of frequency of treatment, everybody's situation is different. Some people may derive benefit and value from a massage every few months, others may seek it out weekly.


As an alternative, ask your partner or spouse to massage your chronically tight muscles on a regular basis. There's lots of instructional videos on the internet that can teach the basics of massage and offer pointers.
Always drink lots of uncaffeinated fluids following a massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products and lactic acid from your body. Not doing so might trigger a headache or mild nausea.

, A relatively common cause of foot and lower leg cramps is wearing ill-fitting shoes — this is particularly true for women who wear high heels on a regular basis. Shoes that are too tight or narrow in the toe cap restricts circulation in the feet and lower legs and can cause spasms, cramps, and strains within the muscles. Furthermore, a lack of arch support can put more strain on the arches (plantar fascia) while weight-bearing and also lead to strain and cramping. As such, wear shoes that grip your heel, have supportive cushioned arches, and provide enough room to wiggle your toes.


Select shoes made from materials that can breathe (not rubber or plastics), which will reduce foot perspiration.
Get fitted for your new shoes later in the afternoon because that's when your feet are larger, usually due to some swelling and arch compression."

Talk to your doctor if you have a medical condition.",How to Get Rid of Leg Cramps," Muscle cramps are sudden and unexpected contractions or spasms of a muscle. To stop the cramp quickly, the cramped muscle needs to be stretched.By stretching the muscle, you are preventing it from remaining in the contracted or cramped position.Stretching a cramped muscle works best if you can hold the stretched position for about a minute, or until the cramp feels better. You may need to repeat the stretched position if you feel the cramp returning.;
, If you have a towel handy, you can use it to gently stretch your hamstring and calf muscles:Lie down on your back.
Place the towel under the ball of one foot. Hold both ends of the towel taut.
Keep your knee straight and slowly lift it until you feel a gentle stretch in the back of your leg.
Adjust the towel so the ankle bends toward you. This helps stretch your calf muscles and relieve your nerves.
Hold this stretch for 30 seconds..

, If your calf muscle is cramping, there are several stretches you can do without needing a towel or a place to lie down. Here are three of them:


Put your weight on the leg that has the cramp, and slightly bend your knee, while keeping your foot flat on the floor.Face a wall, stand a short distance away, and lean against the wall using your hands for support. Keep your cramped leg straight, and the foot and heel on the floor, as you lean your upper body into the wall.Position yourself with your hands on the wall. Place the toe area of your foot, of the leg with the cramping calf muscles, against the wall and your heel on the floor. Keep your leg straight and lean your upper body closer to the wall to stretch the calf muscle.
If you are not able to stand, then sit with your cramped leg extended. Pull the top of your foot towards your head and chest area, keeping your leg straight., If the towel exercise didn't solve a cramping hamstring, try one of these instead:


Sit down and pull your foot towards your head and chest area, keeping your leg straight.Lie on your back and pull your knees to your chest. If someone is available, they can help by gently putting additional pressure on your knees, forcing them a little closer to your chest.

, Have a chair or wall nearby to steady yourself. Bend the knee of your cramped leg, and grab your foot. Pull your foot up towards your lower back and buttocks area., Gently massaging the cramped muscle can help it to relax., Using methods to apply warmth to the area can help the muscle to relax and soothe the pain from the cramp.Methods used to apply heat include using a warm towel, a heating pad, or taking a warm bath or shower. Most people feel relief when warmth is applied to a cramped muscle, plus it improves circulation.., Some people report benefit with applications of ice to a cramped muscle. Determine what works best for you.Avoid placing the ice directly on the skin. Fill a small to medium sized baggie with ice, and add enough water to barely cover the ice. Squeeze the air out, seal it well, then wrap the baggie with damp towel, and apply it to the area.
Another quick option is to use a bag of frozen veggies, like peas or corn. Wrap the package in a damp towel and apply it to the area.

, To prevent future painful episodes, it is helpful to understand what happened that triggered the cramp., If you have repeated problems with leg cramps, if you are elderly, have diabetes or liver disease, nerve compression caused by problems in your lower back, poor circulation in your legs, or thyroid disease, you may be at greater risk of developing leg cramps.Some medications, like diuretics used to treat high blood pressure, can cause changes in your body that normally keep minerals and electrolytes in balance. Your doctor may be able to adjust your medications to help.
Your doctor can help you to treat the underlying problem that is causing your leg cramps., Don’t overdo it. Exercise is important to your overall health, but if you are having leg cramps, then your body is having trouble keeping up with your routine.Adjust your activity to include exercises or activities that use other muscle groups, as your leg muscles adjust to the level of intensity you are working towards., Muscle cramps are more common as the muscles get fatigued, fluids become depleted, and electrolytes in the system may not be adequate. All of these factors can happen simultaneously when your work-outs are lengthy.


If you are experiencing frequent leg cramps, shorten the duration of your work-outs. Then develop a system to very gradually increase the length of your exercise routines as your leg muscles become accustomed to the strenuous activity.

, One of the most common causes of muscle cramps is dehydration during exercise or sporting activities, especially in extreme heat.Increase the amount of water you drink just before, and during your activities. Even drinking water while you are having a cramp can help to relieve it.Water alone may not be enough. During heavy exercise your body is also using electrolytes that need to be replenished. Depleting electrolytes in your body causes muscle cramps.Provide more electrolytes in your system by drinking sports drinks, using salt tablets, and eating more foods that contain electrolytes, such as bananas and oranges.Every person is different, so there is no method to determine the exact amount of each electrolyte you would need to consume in order to prevent leg cramps.
As you exercise, and even as your body sweats during warmer weather, your muscles use more electrolytes than normal.
If you are experiencing leg cramps while you exercise, then it is likely that your body is using up the available electrolytes, therefore you need to replace them.
The easiest way to do this is by drinking a sports beverage that contains calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium. These minerals, or electrolytes, keep your muscles working in a healthy way.
Talk to your doctor before using salt tablets. While commonly used by endurance athletes, they may not be the best option for mild to moderate levels of exercise.

, Eat foods that are rich in minerals including calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium.Examples of foods that are rich in calcium and magnesium include milk, fish, meats, eggs, and fruit.
Include foods in your diet each day that contain potassium. Some foods rich in potassium include bananas, fish, avocados, and potatoes.
Also be sure to get enough salt in your diet. If the weather is hot, and you are sweating from the warmer temperatures, you may want to consider drinking a sports drink each day that contains electrolytes, including sodium, or sodium chloride.

, Stretching those muscles before you begin warms them up, improves blood flow to the area, and improves overall flexibility.This not only helps prevent cramps, but also promotes good posture and healthy joints and spine.


Many athletes also swear by stretching after exercise to relieve muscle fatigue and soreness. This may help your muscle tissue to relax, release any unwanted chemicals that might have accumulated during your work-out, and help to provide adequate blood flow to the muscle tissue.While stretching after exercise does not always prevent muscle cramps from happening, it can help to improve the overall health of your muscle tissue.

, While swimming is great exercise, it is also a common cause of leg cramps. Take proper safety steps as you start swimming, especially if you do not swim year round, and if you are swimming in colder water.Cold water impairs the circulation to your leg muscles as you swim. Take safety precautions to avoid swimming alone, just in case you should experience a cramp in water where it is too deep to touch bottom., Often, leg cramps occur at night. If this is happening to you, then stretch your leg muscles before you go to bed, and be sure you are adequately hydrated.Light exercise just before bed may also help to avoid the leg cramps at night. Take a short walk, or ride a stationary bike for a few minutes prior to going to bed., Under-conditioned muscles are a cause of recurrent leg cramps.If your job requires sitting, try to take breaks at least every 60 minutes and walk around. Even just standing up and “wiggling” is better than constantly sitting. Walk during your lunch break if possible., If you are frequently experiencing leg cramps during your pregnancy, talk with your doctor to be sure your prenatal vitamin has adequate amounts of calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium.Do not make any changes to your vitamin supplement without the advice of your doctor.

, Your pregnancy is not impacted by stretching muscles that are cramping.

, In most women, especially during the second and third trimester, nocturnal leg cramps become more common.The calf muscles are the most common muscle group that tends to cramp at night during pregnancy.
Stretch your calf muscles each night before bed by standing arm’s length away from a wall, put your hands on the wall, then place one foot behind the other.
Gently bend the knee of your leg closest to the wall, and keep your back leg straight with your heel on the floor. Be sure to keep you back and feet straight. Hold this for about 30 seconds.
Switch legs and repeat., You can stretch your hamstring by lying on your back, and pulling your knees to your chest. If someone is available, they can help by gently putting additional pressure on your knees, forcing them a little closer to your chest. Be sure to avoid pressure on your abdomen., Have a chair or wall nearby to steady yourself. Bend the knee of your cramped leg, and grab your foot. Pull your foot up towards your lower back and buttocks area., Wear shoes that are comfortable and have good support in the back area of the shoe.According to the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgery, your feet will grow about ½ size during pregnancy, and will likely remain at that size.Shoes recommended during pregnancy include those with good support all around, including adequate support in the heel area for your ankles.
Consider purchasing athletic shoes to wear during your pregnancy.Try to avoid wearing shoes with higher heels., Stay well hydrated during your pregnancy.


Talk with your doctor about drinking beverages that contain electrolytes, such as sports drinks, if you are in your second or third trimester during the warmer months., Muscle cramps that are severe, recurrent, last more than a few minutes, and are not relieved by stretching warrant medical attention., Your doctor will ask questions to help determine the cause of the cramps.Some of the basic questions will include when the cramps started, how often they occur, how long they last, what muscles are involved, and any recent changes in your level of exercise.You may be asked to provide a list of your current medications, discuss your alcohol intake, and if you have had other symptoms, such as vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sweating, or excessive amounts of urine.Medications can cause changes in your body that may make you more susceptible to leg cramps. For example, some drugs used to treat high blood pressure can alter the way your body handles electrolytes and minerals.Your doctor may draw blood to evaluate for underlying medical problems. Typical blood work done for muscle cramps include tests to evaluate your iron, calcium, potassium, and magnesium levels, and how your body handles those substances. Other common tests include kidney function and thyroid function.The exam may also include steps to be sure you have good circulation in your legs., If you have any leg swelling, redness, or changes in the skin around the area where you have the muscle cramps, you should see your doctor., Medical illnesses can put you at higher risk of leg cramps, especially if you alter your exercise routine.


Some of these medical conditions include diabetes, liver problems, thyroid disease, obesity, or compressed nerves."
"
Add sodium to your diet.,
Get more magnesium.,
Increase your potassium intake.,
Ingest more calcium.",How to Get Rid of Muscle Cramps with Minerals1," Sodium plays an important role in preventing or treating muscle cramps.That's because sodium helps regulate the body's muscle contraction and relaxation.While sodium is an important part of your diet, too much sodium can cause high blood pressure, which can lead to heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and congestive heart failure.Medical professionals typically recommend keeping your daily sodium intake under 2,300 mg each day, or 1,500 mg for individuals over age 50. Individuals with high blood pressure, diabetes, or chronic kidney problems should also lower their daily sodium intake.Common dietary sources of sodium include all vegetables and dairy products, as well as meat and shellfish.;
, Magnesium is one of many minerals that your body needs to ensure proper muscle function.The studies conducted on muscle cramps and magnesium are somewhat inconclusive, although one study did find a significant improvement in pregnant women experiencing muscle cramps.Dietary sources of magnesium include leafy green vegetables, nuts, beans/legumes, and cereal grains.A diet that is too high in fat may reduce your body's ability to absorb magnesium.Over-the-counter magnesium supplements are available at most pharmacies and drug stores.

, Low potassium, also called hypokalemia, can affect your muscles' ability to function properly.Increasing your potassium intake may help alleviate muscle cramps naturally.Some dietary sources of potassium include squash, potatoes, spinach, lentils/beans, bananas, and cantaloupe.Over-the-counter potassium supplements are available at most pharmacies., Calcium is required for proper muscle function.Finding ways to increase your calcium levels may help relieve muscle cramps.Vitamin D is required to properly absorb calcium. You can get vitamin D from foods like salmon and egg yokes, or through exposure to the sun.Dietary sources of calcium include dark leafy vegetables like broccoli, spinach, and kale, as well as milk, soy milk, and some fortified fruit juices.Calcium supplements are also available at most pharmacies; however, some studies suggest that calcium supplements may cause kidney stones and other health risks that outweigh the potential benefits.Talk to your doctor before taking this or any other supplement.

"
Draw a warm bath.,
Add epsom salt.,
Soak in the mineral bath.,
Make an epsom salt compress.",How to Get Rid of Muscle Cramps with Minerals2," Studies have shown that soaking a cramped muscle can help improve blood flow and relax the muscle out of its tense, cramped state.Be sure that the water is not too hot, to prevent burns and discomfort.

, Epsom salt, which is made of magnesium sulfate, is a popular soaking solution for sore or cramped muscles.Add approximately one to two cups of epsom salt per gallon of water in the bathtub., It's okay to completely submerge your body in the epsom salt bath if you want to. At the very least, though, you should completely submerge the part of your body experiencing muscle cramps. Soak for at least 12 minutes to experience the relaxing effects of a mineral bath.Talk to your doctor about how long and how often it is safe to soak in an epsom salt bath., If you do not want to soak in the bath, you can also prepare a compress using the same measurements as you would for a bath. Simply soak a clean towel in the epsom salt bath and apply directly to the cramped muscle."
"
Slow down if you are running and get a side cramp.,
Apply a light massage to the cramping area.,
Take bigger, longer inhales and bigger, longer exhales as you run or workout.,
Try to synchronize your breathing pattern with your running.,
Stretch the side of your body that is cramping.,
Touch your toes.,
Bend 45 to 90 degrees at your waist as you run.",How to Get Rid of Side Cramps1," Most side cramps are related to strenuous exercise, like running. Reduce your pace once you feel the cramps. This will give the cramps time to subside on their own. If they don’t subside, slowing down allows you to try different methods to relieve the pain., One of the quickest ways to get rid of side cramps is to massage the area with light pressure.Place your hand on the area that hurts, usually just under your rib cage on one side.
Inhale and then as you exhale, use your fingers and thumb to lightly pinch or squeeze this area. Apply pressure upward and inward, toward the center of your body.
Relax your hand as you inhale and then apply light pressure with your fingers again as you exhale. Continue this light massage for five to six breaths.

, Inhaling and exhaling with bigger breaths will allow your diaphragm to relax and relieve pressure on your liver and intestines.Focus on bringing your breathing into your belly, as opposed to in your lungs. This will help to oxygenate your blood and relieve pressure on your organs.
You should also avoid shallow breathing when you working out. Shallow breathing keeps your diaphragm raised and can create more pressure on your ligaments., One theory on the cause of side cramps is the rhythm of your breathing as you run affects the level of pressure on the ligaments that connect your diaphragm to your liver. Synchronizing your breath with your movements should help to relieve any pressure on your diaphragm.Determine which side of your body aches. For example, maybe you are experiencing cramps on your left side.
Exhale when the foot on the side that doesn’t ache hits the ground. In this example, you would exhale when your right foot hits the ground.
Inhale when the foot on the side that does ache hits the ground. In this example, you would inhale when your right foot hits the ground.
Maintain this breathing pattern (exhale for the side that doesn’t ache, inhale for the side that does ache) until the side stitch subsides.

, Stretching is important in relieving cramps. To do this, stop running or exercising. Then, raise your arm on the side that is cramping straight up in the air. Lean to the opposite side to stretch the cramped side. Hold the stretch for 2-5 seconds. Relax and repeat the stretch 3-5 times., Stop running or exercising and try to touch your toes. This will help to alleviate pressure on your abdominal area, especially if there is trapped gas in your intestine that may be causing the cramps., This will help to lessen the pressure on your liver and reduce the cramps. Run at distance of about 15 meters with your body bent at the waist and then slowly straighten up to keep running."
"
Avoid eating a meal one to two hours before running or working out.,
Don't eat wheat-based foods, like bread or muesli, before you exercise.,
Stay hydrated throughout the day and during all physical activity.",How to Get Rid of Side Cramps2," Follow the one hour rule and wait at least one hour before doing strenuous exercise. This will give your body time to digest., If you do feel you need to eat or are worried about having less energy during your workout, eat complex carbohydrates like a handful of dried berries or nuts like almonds half an hour before a run or workout.Complex carbohydrates are good snacks before a run or workout because they are digested in your small intestine and have a faster gastric emptying rate, which means they leave your stomach faster. You then won’t be running or working out on a full stomach., Some studies show that side cramps could also occur as a result of dehydration. Rather than drink a lot of water right before a run or workout, focus on drinking at least 8 glasses of water throughout the day. This will ensure you stay hydrated, even through strenuous exercise."
"
Get medical attention if you experience severe abdominal cramps on your right side, nausea, and vomiting.,
Seek medical care if you have severe pain in your right upper abdominal area as well as your right back, shoulder, or chest area.,
Get medical attention if you have severe lower abdominal pain, cloudy or bloody urine, and a burning sensation when you pee.,
Go see a doctor if you have pain on your left or right side and you are pregnant.,
Talk to your doctor if you experience severe abdominal pain, a gurgling stomach, and nausea or vomiting.",How to Get Rid of Side Cramps3," In some cases, side cramps that are severe, especially on your right side, and occur along with other symptoms can be a sign of a more serious medical condition, including:Appendicitis: Your appendix is located on the right side of your lower abdominal. If your appendix starts to swell as the result of an infection, this can lead to some intense pain on your right side and possibly a fever. Your appendix will need to be examined as soon as possible to prevent a rupture. Treatment includes surgical removal of the appendix and if severe, possible treatment with antibiotics.
Ovarian cysts: If you are a woman, severe pain on your right side could also be due to ovarian cysts. These cysts form in your ovary and can cause ovarian cancer. The cysts can be removed through a surgical procedure called a laparoscopy.
A doctor would order blood work and possibly an abdominal CT to diagnose you. Other medical conditions that cause similar pain include testicular torsion, ectopic pregnancy, intussusception, intestinal malrotation, and bowel obstruction. Other causes for women include pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), pelvic cysts, or masses.

, These could all be symptoms of gallstones. Gallstones are stones that form in your gall bladder and can be very painful. But they can be removed through a surgical procedure called a cholecystectomy.Biliary disease is a condition of the right upper quadrant (RUQ). This usually represents itself as right upper quadrant pain due to stretching of the capsule of the liver with inflammation. There can be stones or infection of the biliary tree that leads to this diagnosis. Usually blood work and abdominal ultrasound are used to diagnose this condition. Fever may also be associated. Surgery is the treatment option for this disease as well.

, These could be symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI), which occur when bacteria enters your urethra and your bladder.UTIs are more common in women. Women tend to get a UTI after sexual activity or when using a diaphragm for birth control., If the pain persists, this could be associated with an ectopic pregnancy. An ectopic pregnancy occurs when the fertilized egg implants itself outside the uterus, often in the fallopian tubes.If an ectopic pregnancy occurs, you will feel pain based on which side the egg has implanted itself. The only treatment for an ectopic pregnancy is to terminate the pregnancy.

, These could be symptoms of an ulcerative colitis or a stomach ulcer. Your doctor can prescribe medication to relieve these symptoms.Stomach ulcer result from an overuse of NSAIDS and can be very painful. Other causes of stomach ulcers are H. Pylori bacteria.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease may be causing your abdominal pain. Treatment with antacids may be necessary.
Ulcerative colitis is unusual for this type of pain, but it does lead to belly pain with diarrhea and inflammation of the bowel.

Warm up before you exercise.,
Do plank to strengthen your core.,
Do a dumbbell exercise to strengthen your diaphragm.,
Focus on your breathing as you run or workout.,
Be assured that with consistent exercise, side cramps should go away.",How to Get Rid of Side Cramps4," You should warm up your body no matter what type of exercise you are planning to do, but warm ups are essential if you plan to do a long run or to run at a fast pace. Loosen up your muscles before you attempt an intense run or workout to prevent cramping., Strengthening your core will help your ligaments get used to pressure and tension. Plank is a simple but effective exercise to strengthen your abdominals.Place your hands in line with your shoulders on an exercise mat. Stretch your legs out, hip width apart, so you are in a push up position.
Put weight into your legs and the palms of your hands. Squeeze your abdominal area.
Hold plank for 10 to 15 breaths. Repeat the exercise several times.

, Buffing up your diaphragm should help to lessen your chances of getting side cramps when you run or exercise.Lie on your back on a weight bench. Keep your lower back flat against the bench.
Slowly raise a dumbbell (go for a low amount of weight) with your arms extended up and over your head. When you feel your lower back begin to rise off the bench, stop moving the dumbbell.
Keep your lower back on the bench and take 5-10 breaths. Then, bring the dumbbell back to the start position. Repeat this exercise several times.

, Deeper, fuller inhales and exhales will help to reduce pressure on your diaphragm and will keep you energized as you exercise., Recent studies have shown that the more you run, the more infrequent side cramps become.In fact, as your fitness improves, the likelihood of cramps and pain will decrease. So commit to a running or workout routine and breath through your cramps, as long as they are not too severe."
"
Massage the muscles.,
Stretch.,
Take a bath.,
Elevate the area.,
Use a little ice.",How to Get Rid of a Charley Horse1," Charley horses are typically experienced in the calf, feet, and sometimes thighs; massage these areas to help reduce the pressure and painful cramping. Use medium pressure with your thumbs and fingertips in a circular motion at both the direct area of pain and slightly above it to improve circulation. Continue this for a few minutes until the pain subsides or you wish to move onto another treatment.;
, Your muscles have become constricted as a result of spasms, so stretching will help to relax and soften them. Performing one or several stretches which elongate the muscles in the affected area should help to provide quick relief.


Stand up straight, and then get into a lunging position, with your back leg being the one experiencing the charley horse. Straighten out your back leg while keeping your front leg bent. This will force your weight onto the toes of your back leg; you can lean forward onto your bent knee slightly if it is more comfortable.
Sit down on your bed or the floor, and put your legs straight in front of you. Lock your knees, and point your toes back towards your face. Grab the toes and pull your foot backwards slightly on the leg you’re experiencing the charley horse on.
Stand up straight on your tippy-toes and hold it for as long as you can manage. This will stretch the calf muscles and reduce the spasming. Take a break every few seconds and then continue stretching., Fill your bathtub with warm water and epsom salts and take a soak for 10-20 minutes. The heat and the salts will work together to soothe your tight muscles and distract you from the pain.

, Raise the affected area by propping it up on pillows or the armrest of a chair or couch. Elevating the area will help to improve your circulation and move blood to/from the spasming area more effectively.

, To calm down the muscle spasms, use an ice pack or cool compress on the area you’re experiencing the charley horse. Never apply ice directly, but wrap it in a towel or bandage before placing it on your skin. Do this for 5-15 minutes for the best results.

"
"
Stretch regularly.,
Consume more potassium.,
Consume more calcium and magnesium.,
Keep hydrated.,
Avoid diuretics.",How to Get Rid of a Charley Horse2," If you are exercising or working out on a regular basis, proper stretching beforehand can prevent strain and future charley horses. Stretch for 2-5 minutes before performing any exercise. The best stretches for charlie horse prevention include quad stretches and lunges.


To perform a quad stretch, stand straight up and bend one knee. Continue bending your knee as far as you can, and then grab your foot behind you and hold it for ten seconds.
To do a lunge, get in a kneeling position on the ground so that one leg is bent at the knee and you are resting completely on the other calf. Then, raise yourself off the ground so that both of your legs are bent. Do multiple lunges by walking around the room in that position, going back and forth between legs.

, Low potassium levels are related to an increased likelihood of muscle spasms and cramps. Eat potassium-containing foods at least once a day including bananas, avocados, and oranges. You can also look into getting potassium supplements from a local health foods store.

, These vitamins work hand in hand in preventing muscle cramps and keeping your body in tip-top shape. Make sure you’re consuming enough calcium and magnesium by supplementing your diet with these minerals in the tablet form or in the foods you eat. Dairy products and nuts are full of the combo., When sodium levels in your blood are high, it affects your muscles and circulation. Keep your sodium levels low by drinking plenty of water on a regular basis. When you’re working out, supplement your intake of water with sports drinks that have added electrolytes.

, Anything that causes you to urinate more will reduce the amount of water and electrolytes in your body, a no-go for muscle cramps. Avoid drinking too much caffeine and don’t take any pills that cause frequent urination whenever possible.

"

Eat a banana.,
Avoid caffeine as much as possible.,
Drink (decaffeinated) chamomile tea.,
Try a sports drink.,
Take omega-3 fatty acids.,
Try other beneficial supplements.,
Have 1 tsp (5 ml) of Blackstrap Molasses.",How to Get Rid of Cramps (Girls)1," Bananas contain potassium, which may reduce cramps, as cramps could be due to a potassium deficiency.Other foods that contain loads of potassium include:


White beans, such as Adzuki, soy, or Lima beans
Leafy greens, such as spinach or kale
Dried fruits, such as apricots, prunes, or raisins
Fish, such as salmon, halibut, and tuna;
, Having too much caffeine can make your cramps worse. Some sources recommend avoiding foods and drinks that contain caffeine, such as coffee, teas, colas, etc before and during your period., A recent study done by the Imperial College of London found that drinking German chamomile tea (also called Matricaria recutita) helped relieve pain caused by menstrual cramps.Chamomile contains glycine, an amino acid that can relieve muscle spasms. By relaxing the uterus, chamomile appears to be helpful in relieving cramps caused by periods.

, Although there is no scientific evidence to suggest that drinking a sports drink will help with period cramping, it can't hurt. Sports drinks contain electrolytes, which help regular cramping.


Why might sports drinks be ineffective? Regular cramping may be caused from hyperactivity or a deficiency of essential nutrients such as potassium or magnesium. Period cramping, however, is caused by contractions of the uterus, which tries to expel the uterine lining and any eggs that went unfertilized during ovulation. Because period cramping isn't caused by the same thing as normal muscle cramping, sports drinks may be less effective than advertised.

, Taking a daily fish-oil supplement — high in a healthy fat called omega-3 fatty acid — could help you reduce pain caused by menstrual cramping. One study found that women who took daily fish oil supplements had less pain associated with cramping than women who simply took a placebo., Ask your doctor about supplements before you begin a serious change in your diet. Some supplements may interact adversely with one another or with medications that you may be taking. The following supplements may also be beneficial to your health and keep you from reeling with pain when your period does come:


Calcium citrate, 500 - 1,000 mg daily. Calcium citrate helps by maintaining muscle tone.Vitamin D, 400 IU daily. Vitamin D helps your body process calcium as well as help fight inflammation.Vitamin E, 500 IU daily. Vitamin E may help reduce menstrual pain.
Magnesium, 360 mg daily, for 3 days before menstruation starts. Magnesium helps reduce the prostaglandins, or chemicals released during menstruation that cause muscle contractions, involved in menstrual pain., Derived from the sugar refining process, blackstrap molasses is a nutrient-rich syrup. This grade of molasses boasts high amounts of calcium, iron, potassium, magnesium, manganese, vitamin B6 and selenium. These nutrients reduce cramping by minimizing blood clots, relaxing the muscles and restoring the system’s nutrient level.

Elevate your legs.,
Try acupuncture.,
Place pressure on your stomach for 10 seconds.,
Massage your abdomen.,
Walk around.,
Go jogging for a little bit.,
Do a few sit-ups.",How to Get Rid of Cramps (Girls)2," Keep your legs a foot or two above the rest of your body with pillows. This can force your uterine muscles to relax.

, In several studies, women who were treated with acupuncture reported less pain and needed less medication.Acupuncture works by balancing out the qi (or energy deficiencies) in the body. In the case of menstrual cramping, the qi imbalances are purportedly in the spleen and liver area., Gentle pressure is best, and repeat in 10-second intervals as needed. Your body will start to notice the sensation of the pressure instead of the sensation of pain caused by the menstrual cramping. More than just offering a distraction, the pressure could also soothe some of the pain.

, Massage the front of the abdomen, working back to your lower back. Have a friend or a family member massage your lower back if possible. This will reduce a lot the pain for some time. 

, Walking is an effective and easy remedy for pain associated with menstrual cramping. For best results, walk briskly, and do this exercise for 30 minutes cycles at least three times a day.Walking will help get your beta-endorphins going, as well as reduce prostaglandins.

, This will give you enough exercise to keep you in less pain. In lieu of exercise, you can try other forms of aerobic exercise. Again, shoot for 30 minutes of controlled, medium-intensity aerobic exercise, 3 times a week.


Biking
Swimming
Dancing
Sports, such as soccer or basketball, that involve running

, Any exercise may be beneficial, but sit-ups work your abdominal muscles especially, focusing attention away from cramping and toward the pleasant burn in your outer tummy.


Exercise releases beta-endorphins in your body, which are internal opioids, or the morphine that your body produces all on its own."

Use preventative care.",How to Get Rid of Cramps (Girls)3," Alternate the hot water bottle by placing it on your lower back. (You may need to have two hot water bottles handy in order to do this.

, A warm bath is another form of heat treatment used to reduce the pain of cramping in women. Warm baths are believed to relax the muscles of the body, making the pain less noticeable.


Try putting a cup or two of Epsom salts in the bath. Epsom salts are high in magnesium, a deficiency of which may cause cramping. Soak in the bath for at least 30 minutes.
Try adding a cup of sea salt and a cup of baking soda to the water. This combination might further relax the muscles of the body. Soak in the bath for at least 30 minutes.

, Choose painkillers like ibuprofen, paracetamol or painkillers designed specially for period cramps. Just be sure to follow the directions on the bottle!

, For severe pain associated with menstrual cramps, talk to your doctor about birth control. Taking birth control pills may reduce pain, bloating, and cramps associated with periods.If you have severe cramping and pain during your periods, talk to your doctor about the birth control options available to you.

, Painful menstrual cramps may be prevented before they even start to bother you. Avoiding the following may help give you a break from period cramping before you even have to deal with it:


Alcohol, tobacco, and other stimulants
StressInactivity

Consider drinking tonic water with quinine.,
Apply a hot compress to the extremity.,
Get potassium into your system.,
For pregnant women, try taking magnesium supplements.,
Drink plenty of water and avoid dehydration.,
Try taking calcium channel blockers.,
Stay away from tight bedsheets.,
Stretch your calf muscles before retiring.",How to Eliminate Leg Cramps at Night1," Tonic water containing quinine has been shown to help people suffering from nighttime leg cramps. On the other hand, the FDA has just advised against using larger doses of quinine, found in the drug Qualaquin, to treat muscle cramps. 1997 Cohrane Review of published and unpublished trials on the quinine trials have concluded that although improvement was seen in the patients taking the drug compared to those taking placebo, the side effects, tinnitus in particular, was also more often associated with the group taking quinine. The authors have concluded: ""owing to the side‐effect profile of quinine, non‐pharmacological therapy such as passive muscle stretching is the best first‐line treatment, though the use of quinine is warranted if this therapy is ineffective. Prescribing physicians should closely monitor the risks and benefits in individual patients."".;
, A hot water bottle or electric heating pad could relax and loosen up the muscle, easing the cramps. Just be sure not to fall asleep with an electric heating pad on if you choose to use one.


If you both have a heating pad, try massaging a generous amount of VapoRub into the cramp area. Eventually, the cooling effect should kick in and relieve the cramp.

, It's possible that a potassium deficiency could lead to nighttime cramps in your extremities (usually your legs).If you're not getting enough potassium, consider eating more sources of potassium, listed below, or begin to take potassium supplements with meals. Good natural sources of potassium include:


Fruits like bananas, nectarines, dates, apricots, raisins or grapes.
The cabbage or broccoli family of vegetables.
Oranges and grapefruit.
Saltwater fish, pork, and lamb.

, Younger pregnant women are more likely to benefit from magnesium supplementation, which is critical to normal bodily function.Unfortunately, for older or non-nursing adults, studies show that magnesium supplements are far less conclusive.

, Nighttime cramps can sometimes be a result of not drinking enough water. Make sure that you're drinking enough H2O during the course of the day in order to prevent cramps during the night.


How much water are you supposed to drink during the course of the day? According to the Mayo Clinic, females should aim to drink about 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) a day, while males should aim to drink about 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water a day.How can you easily tell whether you've had enough water to drink? Look at the transparency of your urine. Clear urine signals adequate hydration, while yellowish urine signals less adequate hydration.
Steer clear of alcohol. Excessive alcohol consumption robs the body of water, making the possibility for cramping that much worse. Cutting back on alcohol consumption is great for your overall health as well.

, Calcium channel blockers keep calcium from entering various cells and blood vessel walls in the body. Though they are primarily used to treat high blood pressure, they can also be used to help with nighttime muscle cramps.See your doctor for a prescription and specific dosage information.

, Tight bedsheets or covers can cause you to unconsciously point your toes downward while sleeping. This movement can trigger calf cramps. Stick with looser bedsheets to minimize the chance of toe-pointing; pull your toes back toward your body if a calf cramp suddenly sets in., Stretching your calves before retiring to bed at night can help ease muscle tension. See section below for specific calf muscle exercises to try.

"
"
Stretch your calf out using a towel.,
Stretch your inner calf.,
Stretch out your leg with the aid of a wall.,
Stretch your Achilles tendon, which attaches the heel to your calf.",How to Eliminate Leg Cramps at Night2," Set your leg on a towel or bed sheet stretched horizontally out. Fold it in half hamburger style, so it encloses the part of your leg which has the cramp. Grab the open end and hug it as a child would hug a security blanket. This stretch works by compressing the leg and effectively massaging it.

, In a sitting position, stretch one leg out and another leg (the calf you want to stretch) bent, so that the knee approaches your chest. Take hold of the bottom of the toe from the bent leg and pull it toward your body as much as you can., Lie down on the side where the thigh does not have the cramp, and face the wall. Extend the leg that has the cramp so that it is perpendicular to the rest of the body, and so that it is fully straight and touches the wall. Hold for 10-20 seconds before bringing your leg back, to stretch the muscle in the back of the thigh.

, In a sitting position, stretch one leg out and another leg bent. Bring the heel of the bent leg close to your buttocks. Keep your heel on the ground but lift your toe up, holding until the stretch loosens up your muscle.

"
"
Put an ordinary motel sized bar of soap under the part of your leg which has the cramp.,
Try drinking cow's milk.,
Try primrose oil.,
Try brewer's yeast.,
Take both valerian and skullcap as relaxing herbs.",How to Eliminate Leg Cramps at Night3," Alternatively, apply hypo-allergenic liquid soap directly to the center of the cramp. Wait a few seconds and your cramp should be gone or almost gone!


Why does soap soothe nighttime cramps? Although it does not seem to work in all cases, soap placed on the calf possibly allows a molecule to diffuse out of the soap gel and provide lasting relief.It may be that the acting molecule is capable of diffusing in air, or it may require direct contact with the affected area.

, The theory here is that milk can help shuffle out an imbalance of calcium, thereby helping with nocturnal muscle cramps. On the other hand, milk contains high amounts of phosphorous, which may make the cramps even worse. Try this home remedy for yourself and see if it works; many people swear by it.

, Primrose oil is used for a wide range of treatable conditions, ranging from acne and eczema to high cholesterol and heart disease. It's possible that primrose oil can help with leg pain and leg cramps caused by blocked blood vessels, although insufficient evidence so far exists.Take 3 to 4 grams before bed.

, Brewer's yeast may improve circulation in the legs by supplying additional B vitamins. It is recommended by some doctors, but clinical trials have not yet produced verifiable results.Try taking one tablespoon of brewer's yeast per day.

, Skullcap is an anxiety and insomnia treatment, mostly taken in combination with valerian, which is another sedative.Although clinical trials have linked skullcap to liver damage, it's usually only when used in combination with other botanicals.Follow the label directions when taking valerian and skullcap, or make tinctures out of both. Note that valerian has a distinct odor that may find unpleasant and may take some time getting used to.

Watch out for short-acting loop diuretics.,
Watch out for thiazide diuretics.,
Know that statins and fibrates may also cause leg cramps.,
Be on the lookout for ACE-inhibitors.,
See if anti-psychotics aren't causing leg cramps.",How to Eliminate Leg Cramps at Night4," Short-acting loop diuretics help get rid of excess water in the body, sending it to the bladder and turning it into urine. You can probably guess why these kinds of medications may spell trouble for people suffering from cramps. Cramps are sometimes caused by dehydration. If you take one of these and experience leg cramps at night, talk to your doctor about adopting long-acting loop diuretic, or other possible solutions., Thiazide diuretics, like short-acting loop diuretics, deplete key electrolytes in the body, paving the way for possible cramping. Thiazide diuretics are used for high blood pressure and heart failure, among other conditions.


Another class of hypertension drug, called beta-blockers, can also cause muscle cramping. Beta-blockers curb the adrenaline hormone, thereby slowing the heart rate. Although scientists aren't completely clear on why they cause leg cramps, they believe it may have to do with the constriction of arteries.

, Used to combat high cholesterol, statins and fibrates may interfere with muscle growth, causing a decrease in muscle energy. Ask your doctor whether it's prudent to sub statins and fibrates for vitamin B12, folic acid, and vitamin B6., ACE-inhibitors are hypertension drugs that curb angiotensin II, a hormone that causes arteries to constrict. ACE-inhibitors can sometimes cause an electrolyte imbalance of potassium, leading to muscle cramps.

, Schizophrenia, bipolar, and other conditions may warrant the use of drugs that treat depression, hallucination, and agitation. This class of drugs, which includes Abilify, Thorazine, and Risperdal, can induce fatigue, lethargy and weakness, sometimes resulting in leg cramps. Talk with your doctor if you believe that you may be experiencing leg cramps as a result of antipsychotics.

"
"
Try pain medication.Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen provide very effective pain relief for cramps.,
Apply heat.,
Massage the area.Massaging your abdominal region and lower back is a great way to loosen the muscle tension and to relieve cramps.,
Have sex.Depending on how you feel about having sex while on your period (and also what part of your period you are on — for instance, it is easier to have sex in the final few days when your blood flow is lighter), consider having sex to relieve pain from menstrual cramps.,
Drink hot tea.",How to Get Rid of Cramps1," NSAIDs tend to work quickly, easing the pain within half an hour or so. They are available over-the-counter in most countries. Follow the dosing instructions on the bottle. Generally, you can take 400-600mg every four to six hours as needed.Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is another option that can help with the pain of menstrual cramps. It can be used in addition to NSAIDs as they work via different mechanisms in your body. Tylenol and ibuprofen should be alternated and not used together at the same time.
If over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen are insufficient to control your pain, you can speak to your physician for a prescription-strength alternative which may be more effective in controlling your menstrual pain.
Do not take aspirin if you are under 19-years-old without first consulting your doctor. Aspirin may cause a rare but serious condition called Reye's syndrome.;
, Menstrual cramps are located in the uterus, which contracts to release its lining when you have your period. The uterus, like any muscle, relaxes in response to warm temperatures, so applying some heat to your abdomen may help relieve cramps.Fill a hot water bottle and lay it across your stomach while you are resting. Let it sit for as long as you'd like.
Make sure you do not fall asleep while the heating pad is on you.Another option is to draw a warm bath and soak for about half an hour. Try to relax your muscles in response to the warm water.

, Place your hands over your stomach or back and gently knead the area. A vibrating self-massaging tool applied to your back can also help, or you could ask a partner to massage you.

, The chemicals released in your body during sex act as pain-relievers, and can also help to relax the muscles in that area of your body.

, Tea can help to settle your stomach and to relieve aching muscles. Certain types of tea have properties that can relax the uterus and help to get rid of painful cramping. Brew yourself a pot of one of these types of tea:


Raspberry leaf, which eases muscle cramps
Cramp bark, which relaxes the uterus
Dong Quai, which soothes the nervous system.

"
"
Don't ingest substances that make cramps worse.,
Move your body.,
Try taking a hormonal birth control pill.Some women take hormonal birth control pills, which contain estrogen and progestin, as a way to control the severity of their menstrual cramps.,
Get a progestin IUD inserted.This is a device that is inserted directly into the uterus.,
See your naturopath for supplements.,
Quit smoking.Smoking has been linked to a higher incidence of painful menstrual cramps.",How to Get Rid of Cramps2," Caffeine, alcohol, and sugar can make cramps feel worse and cause them to last longer.Limiting these substances throughout the month, and especially during your period when you feel cramps coming on, can prevent cramps from feeling as painful.


Limit your intake of coffee, black tea, and caffeinated soda.
Avoid drinking too much wine, beer, or hard alcohol, especially while you're on your period.
Reduce your consumption of fast food, snack foods, and other foods that have high glycemic indices (foods that are high in carbohydrates, salt and sugar).

, Studies show that women who exercise regularly don't experience cramps as severely as women who don't exercise regularly.Exercising throughout the month helps to prevent severe cramps, and exercising while you have cramps can loosen your muscles and ease some of the pain.


Incorporate running, walking, biking, or swimming into your routine.
Strength training strengthens your muscles and contributes to overall wellness, so it's a good idea to add this component to your workouts.
Yoga is a relaxing form of exercise to try while you are experiencing cramps.
Also, being closer to your ideal body weight has been correlated with reduced pain during menstrual cramps., The birth control pill thins the uterine lining, so the uterus doesn't contract as much to release it when your period comes. Speak to your doctor about getting a prescription for birth control pills if this is of interest to you. It is actually the first-line medical treatment used in cases of severe menstrual cramps.


The same hormones as those found in the birth control pill can also be administered using injections, a patch, or a vaginal ring. Talk to your doctor about the best method for your needs.
Another option is to try progesterone-only treatment. This is usually tried as a secondary measure if the birth control pill does not work; however, for some women, it seems to be more effective., It functions both as contraception, and has the added benefit of greatly diminishing menstrual flow and menstrual cramps. Some women find that their period almost disappears when they are using a progestin IUD (the bleeding and cramping becomes very light, and for some women it can go away altogether). Getting a progestin IUD may be more expensive upfront (speak to your doctor about the costs, which are usually a few hundred dollars); however, they are often covered by insurance and you can leave it in and it is effective for up to five years.


Having a progestin IUD inserted is one of the most effective long-term solutions for alleviating painful menstrual cramps.
The progestin IUD is also the ""gold standard"" of contraception, which is the term doctors use to describe the fact that it is the number one most effective way to prevent unwanted pregnancies.

, Some supplements such as Chasteberry, Macagen, and Magnesium, among others, have been shown to reduce painful menstrual cramps. Other complementary alternative therapies to try are ginger, zinc sulfate and turmeric. All of these have been shown to help with pain relief of menstrual cramps due to its anti-inflammatory and analgesic (pain-reducing) properties.Speak to your naturopath if this is an avenue you would like to explore.

, Therefore, if you have been considering quitting and also happen to suffer from painful period cramps, now may be the time to quit smoking as the benefits to your health are multiple.

Ask your doctor about endometriosis.Endometriosis is a painful condition that results when endometrium tissue (the tissue that normally lines the uterus) is found outside of the uterus and causes pain every month during your period.,
Consider endometrial ablation.If you are an older woman who is no longer seeking to become pregnant, another way to handle painful menstrual cramps is through a surgical procedure called endometrial ablation.,
Always see your doctor in more severe cases of menstrual pain.",How to Get Rid of Cramps3," This happens because the tissue responds to the menstrual cycle the same way as when it is in the uterus and builds up, breaks down and sheds; however, because this tissue is not in the uterus, it has no way to leave the body and the excess build up causes inflammation, scar tissue and severe pain. Pain medications and hormonal treatments may not be enough to control the pain from endometriosis. This is because it is typically a condition that requires more extensive medical evaluation and intervention.


If you suspect you may have endometriosis, the first step is to book an appointment with your doctor who can set you up for the necessary tests.
The only way to confirm (and to treat) endometriosis is via laparoscopic surgery.
You will have a daytime surgery (of less than an hour duration) where an OB/GYN medical specialist will insert a camera through some small openings in your abdomen to check for the presence of uterine tissue outside of the uterus.
If any uterine tissue is found in the abdominal cavity, the surgeon can perform ""ablation,"" meaning getting rid of the tissue that is not supposed to be there.
Following this procedure, your menstrual pain should be greatly diminished (if not eliminated altogether).
It is important to treat endometriosis if you suspect you may have it because, if present for a long time, it can lead to complications such as chronic pelvic pain or troubles with fertility.
Speak to your doctor for further information if you suspect this may apply to you.

, What this means is that a device is inserted through your vagina into your uterus, and the menstrual tissue lining the uterine wall is ""burned off,"" or removed. You will be under general anesthesia at this time, so you will not feel any pain.


The next time your period is supposed to come, there will be very little to no menstrual tissue left to become inflamed.
As a result, you will experience minimal to no bleeding at the time of your period, and it should also make a notable difference in getting rid of your pain.
Your surgeon will aim to remove 90% of the uterine endometrial tissue at the time of surgery, so often about 10% remains. This is to make sure that your doctor does not accidentally damage the uterus itself.

, In extreme cases of painful menstrual cramps, it may mean that something more serious is going on. Your doctor may need to perform blood tests, or even to insert a laparoscopic camera into your lower abdomen or pelvic area to see what is going on. If you have more complex issues that go beyond simple period cramps, it is important to have this diagnosed and treated appropriately. Most solutions to more complex issues are surgical.

It strengthens pelvic muscles and helps with menstrual cramps. It also has a soothing effect on the brain and, thus, relieves fatigue and anxiety.Sit on the floor spreading your legs forward. Bend the right knee outward to about a 90 degree angle. Both your right leg and your thigh will touch the floor. Now bring the right foot towards the left thigh so that the sole of the foot touches the inner thigh.
Grab the left foot with both hands, inhale and bend your torso over the left leg. Make your spine as straight as possible instead of allowing it to be curved.
Breathe slowly and deeply for one to two minutes. Then sit up slowly and repeat the pose for the right leg after a minute of rest.;
, This pose is intended to stretch the groins, hips, back of the thighs and legs. Relieving back pain, sciatica, and menstrual cramps are its main therapeutic uses.Lie straight on your back with your head on the floor. Lift the right leg by partially bending the knee.
Clasp the right toes with the right fingers. Press your left thigh with the left hand to prevent spontaneous lifting of the left leg.
Now exhale slowly and straighten the right leg as much as possible without overexerting. It may feel difficult to fully straighten the right leg because your lower limbs are longer than the upper limbs.
To equalize the lengths, you may use a belt or towel to wrap around the right foot and hold that belt/towel with your right hand at a suitable length. Your right leg will now easily become straight.
Hold your right leg straight and in an upright position. Breathe gently and hold this pose for one to three minutes. Bring the right leg back to the floor and repeat the pose for the left leg.

, This pose sets a person into a state of relaxation. You also give a workout to your pelvic floor. Thus, anxiety and the discomfort of menstrual cramps are benefitted.Sit on the floor comfortably with your back straight. Spread out the legs and bring the soles of your feet together bending your knees horizontally at 90 degree angles.
Keep your knees in contact with the floor, thus both your legs and thighs will touch the ground. Both lower limbs will now form a diamond shape. Lean forward gently while you breathe in. Exhale in the leaning position and again come back upright while straightening your back.
Repeat this for about two to three minutes or as long as you feel comfortable.

, This pose stretches the hips and groin as well as strengthening pelvic organs. It can also reduce discomfort from menstrual cramps, fatigue, and anxiety.Sit on a floor comfortably with your back straight and knees bent. Move your left foot under your right thigh so that the sole of the foot exceeds the outer border of the thigh.
Now stack your right leg on top of the left thigh. Your right leg should rest on the lower part of your left thigh and your right ankle should be outside the outer border of the left thigh. If it feels tight or difficult to bring the right ankle over the left knee or thigh, simply sit with your shin crossed.
Place the palms of your hands on the floor in front of your shins. Now exhale and lean forward by bending at your hips. Remember to keep your torso straight, not curved at the abdomen.
Breathe deeply and slowly for one minute. You will notice that the torso rises a bit with each inhalation. Stress the front of the body during this time so that there is lengthening from your pubis to sternum. You may feel like you are a bit convex forward at the torso.
Hold this pose for one minute and get back upright and uncross your legs. Repeat the pose with the left leg on top of the right.

, This is a very popular pose worldwide because of its numerous benefits. Even little ones know and enjoy doing this pose. It is believed that lotus pose improves concentration as well as relieving anxiety, depression, and fatigue. It also stretches the pelvis, spine, and abdomen and helps in sciatica, low back pain, and menstrual cramps.Sit on the floor with your legs spreading straight in front. Bend the right knee and hold the right leg using both hands as a cradle. The outer edge of the right foot will rest on the left elbow-bend and right knee on the right elbow-bend while both hands remain clasped. Swing your leg right and left a few times to explore the full range of movement of the right hip.
With a smooth but quick movement at the right hip, place the right leg over the left thigh so that the outer edge of the right foot is locked into the left groin. Press the right heel into the left lower abdomen.
Keeping your back straight, hold the left leg at the ankle and shin with both hands and place it over the right thigh. The alignment will be similar to that of right leg which is that the outer edge of the left foot will be locked into the right groin and the left heel will press on the right lower abdomen.
Bring the knees as close as possible. Keep your hands over the corresponding knees with the palms facing up and the thumbs touching the little fingers.
Hold this pose for just a few seconds the first couple of times you try it, then gradually increase the duration. Over time, you should be able to hold this pose for up to one minute. Do this pose three to four times daily during your period.

, This pose is so named because you look like a bow while practicing, with the trunk/torso resembling the body of the bow and the arms the string. You need to start by lying on your belly while keeping your hands by the side of your body and palms facing up.Now bend your knees to bring the feet close to the buttocks. Keep your thighs parallel to each other. Lift your hands and grasp your ankles.
While taking a deep breath pull back your ankles strongly with your hands so that the legs are lifted away from the buttocks. This will passively lift your thighs and also your upper torso and head off the floor.
Continue raising your legs while pressing your shoulder blades firmly against your back. This will open your ribcage and make the chest look wider.
Breathe slowly and deeply for about half a minute. Then release the pose while exhaling slowly. Stay lying on your belly for the next half minute. Repeat the pose two to three times.

, This pose stretches the spine, neck, and chest. Such stretching stimulates abdominal organs and the lungs; strengthens the legs; reduces menstrual cramps; and helps with anxiety, fatigue, and backaches.Lie on the floor facing up, keeping a folded blanket under your shoulders to support the neck. Bend your knees, keeping the flat of the foot on the floor and heels close to the buttock.
Now raise your hips, pressing your feet and arms on the floor while exhaling slowly. Your buttock will tighten in this position. Support your body by keeping the entire length of the arms on the floor (palms facing downwards as well).
Continue lifting your hips until the thighs become parallel to the ground and lower legs upright. Do not keep your knees wide apart.
Keep your head and neck straight and on the floor. Now firming the shoulder blades against your back, raise your chest so that the chest comes close to your chin.
Stay in this position for up to one minute. Then gently bring your torso down to the floor while exhaling slowly. Lie down comfortably for a minute.

, This pose stretches thighs, groins and spine. Tones of abdominal organs are improved helping in digestion and bowel movement. It also relieves back pain and menstrual discomfort.Take a squatting position with the feet together and keep your thighs and legs in contact with each other. Swing both of your knees to the left and your torso to the right. Place your left arm over the right thigh just above the knee. Now turn the left arm and forearm in front of the legs and further to the back of the left leg. Thus you will actually wrap both of your folded legs with the left upper limb.
If it feels difficult for you to wrap both legs, do it for only the left leg. That is, keep your left arm in between your thighs and turn the left forearm to wrap around the left leg.
Take a deep breath while moving your right arm behind the lower back so that the right hand can reach the left hand and clasp it.
Turn your head to the right stretching the chest and breathe slowly for about a minute. Now release the pose while exhaling slowly.
Take a break of one minute and repeat the pose for the opposite side (your knees to the right and your torso to the left).

, This pose stretches the front of the entire body and improves the muscle tone of this area. It stimulates a refreshing mood and relieves fatigue and anxiety. The stretching also helps relieve menstrual cramps.Start by kneeling on the floor keeping your knees a bit apart and your feet fully extended at the ankles. Thus, the shins and dorsum of the feet (upper surface of the feet) will touch the floor.
Arch backwards while hanging the arms freely. At some point, your hands will touch your heel. Now grab your ankles firmly with your hands.
While taking a deep breath, lift your chest. It will make your body more arched. Then push the hips forward while you exhale. This move will lengthen and stretch the front of the body.
Keep your head and neck parallel to the ground while looking upward. Keeping this position, breathe slowly for 30 to 60 seconds. Then release the pose while exhaling slowly. Repeat the pose a few times with one minute intervals between.

, This pose is very different from the poses mentioned earlier. This pose lengthens and releases tension from your spine. It strengthens the arms, shoulders, and muscles of the back of the body and lower limbs. It also helps relieve the symptoms of menopause and the discomfort of menstruation.Get on the floor on your hands and knees. The palms of your hands will touch the ground and remain spread. Keep your thighs upright and hands slightly forward.
Start lifting your knees off the ground with a long breath. Do not extend the knees completely at once. Also, keep the heels lifted away from the floor for comfort.
Now exhale and elongate your tailbone away from the back of the pelvis and press it gently towards the pubis. Raise the sitting bones using this resistance. Your legs and thighs will form straight lines. Push your thighs backward to place your heels onto the ground. Roll the upper thighs inward so your hamstrings will be less tensed.
Maintain light pressure on the floor with the bases of your index fingers. Widen your shoulder blades and move them downward (toward the tailbone). Keep your head and neck in line with your arms.
Stay in this pose for one to two minutes while breathing gently. Then get back to the floor to take rest for another few minutes.

, Yoga will help to relax the body and the mind. This is seen through the varied breathing techniques that are employed when doing yoga. The movements that are used in yoga do not add any stress to the body, but they help it to relax.

, Yoga helps the body to achieve flexibility. When one takes part in yoga, the muscles that were previously tense are relaxed and stretched. This helps to reduce the muscle cramping and relieve general pain in the body., The techniques that are used in yoga help to relax many different muscles in the body. This helps to reduce tension and stress in the body.This is achieved through the different techniques that are used to inhale and exhale, allowing one to relax.
This allows the release of all the tension that has been contained in the body and allows one to achieve peace of mind.

, Yoga techniques help in promoting the function of the endocrine system, which controls the release of hormones in the body.Hormones that are released during the menstrual cycle are one of the major causes of menstrual cramps. Therefore, when the hormones are balanced through yoga, the cramps are controlled.

, The yoga poses will help to tone varied muscles in the body. This helps to keep you in great shape and avoid being overweight. This also helps you to avoid accumulating fat, especially around the abdomen, because the abdominal muscles are toned by yoga."

Girls and young teens have soft, white hair on their cheeks, while older males don't.",How to Pass As a Boy when Being Small Sized," A good binder can make the difference. If your breasts aren't large, a well-fitting binder could flatten your chest so much that people would think you just can't be a female.


If you don't have a binder yet, you could try some temporary solutions. Each has its own advantages and flaws: Ace bandages should never be used, because the health effects are too risky. Lycra tights (With the legs cut off and a cut in the middle, to be worn alike to a sports bra.) are cheap and available, however they rarely last for more than a couple of days. A sports bra with high Lycra content (Title 9 has a good one branded as ""Frog bra"".) can do if you have small breasts, but it could never completely bind them as a binder does, and will have less effect on larger breasts.;
, If men's Small size is clearly too big for you, avoid it. It will only emphasize your tiny measure and make you look frail. In that case, however, go to the children section and pick carefully for items for boys in your size, usually European 10-16 should do. Try to pick carefully and avoid anything that is clearly aimed for children: Nothing that has childish prints or has words like ""Youth"" and ""Kids"" on it. Button-ups, dark T-shirts that aren't tight, hoodies and etc. can be good for you.

, A button-down shirt over a T-Shirt, a loose T-Shirt over a tighter one, etc. This can make you appear flatter.

,, Many Emo/Scene boys are short and slender, and appear somewhat feminine or androgynous, so it will only seem reasonable on you. Also, since Emo is identified with teenagers, it could explain why you don't have face hair yet/have such a slender body/Such gentle face. This could work well especially if you live in a place where Emo/Scene is rather common and popular.

, If your feet are small, you'll have a problem finding good shoes. You can try the children section, or stick to unisex brands—Vans, Converse All Stars, Doc Martens (Docs could also add about an inch to your height) etc. Try to stick to solid or masculine models and avoid strange colours. Unisex shoes are healthier to your feet rather than children shoes. Take that in count.

, This is a little difficult because it demands a constant awareness, at least until it becomes a habit. Try to get yourself used to speak in a lower key (Think Contra-Alt). You might not be able to reach low enough to sound exactly as a biological male, but the closer you achieve, the better it is.

, Men tend to catch more space than woman. Sit with your legs parted. Don't cross your legs but prefer square-cross.

, It is a rather girlish move that will emphasize how narrow your waist is.

, Not only it is a feminine mannerism, it will also attract attention to the feminine structure of your face.

, This, of course, does not catch when it comes to your partner. Also, try small talk. Men do not tend to share intimate information with people they aren't close to, while girls tend to open up rather quickly.

, Avoid a marines cut or anything too short, because it could emphasize the feminine structure of your face. Avoid bangs, or prefer emo-ish side-swept ones. Square off your sideburns (Those little bits of hair in front of your ears)- This is a girlish feature. Alternatively, keep your hair long and in a loose ponytail- This could mostly work if your face is rather androgynous/masculine.

, Consider shaving it off, but first check out how shaving effects your skin. For some people it can make hair grow darker, which might be good or bad for you, depending on your own feeling. Try to shave a small portion of body hair somewhere else where its similarly light and soft, and check out if it suits you or not.

Most Pink Jocks will wear French braids, ponytails or messy buns with neon headbands and hair clips etc. Messy buns, at the moment, are particularly in style, and the higher you wear it on your head, the better. Pink Jocks are perky; every hairstyle you wear must be HIGH UP on your head. Think Whoville. Droopy, at-the-neck ponytails? So amateur. Blue Jocks want to be boys, so hair? Think boys. Short, shaggy and cropped. Hair accessories are a big no-no. Except for an exercise band that makes you look like Mikey's older brother from Goonies. If you have long hair and don't want to cut it or can't find a wig, then go for a messy bun. Ponytails and braids are way too girly for a Blue Jock.;
, Pink Jocks, wear sweatsuits. Preferably pink or purple ones. With sequins. And glitter. And gems. Sunglasses are an added bonus. If it's too hot for a sweatsuit, buy an off-the-shoulder pink T-shirt with someone like Katy Perry on the front and pair with pink knee-high sweatpants. Blue Jocks, your favorite jersey and a pair of shorts is the way to go.

, Something that doesn't require chipping nails. Blue Jocks, you like the more physical sports. Soccer, football, baseball. These are just suggestions; often they can be switched.

, Track shoes, tennis shoes, and Converse are the way to go.

, First of all, know what you're talking about. If you choose football, choose a favorite team like the Jets or the Bengals. Watch a few football games. Learn the names of different plays and what a Wide Receiver is. If you choose tennis, read books on Justine Henin and talk about her all the time as your role model. Most importantly, PLAY your ""favorite sport"" so you can know what you're talking about. Then...talk about it!! That sport is your life. What else IS there to talk about besides your sport?

, They'll probably know more than you do. If they DO mention something you don't know about your sport, DON'T ADMIT IT. A jock is extremely conceited and popular and knows everything. Just shrug and say, ""Yeah, whatever,"" and shift the topic to something you do like. If they ask you a question you don't know the answer to, just say, ""If you really knew the sport that well, you wouldn't need to ask such simple questions,"" and ignore them.

Wear a backpack.,
Get yourself a suit and tie.,
Carry a suitcase.",How to Make a Girl Look Like a Boy1," Whereas women are expected to combine a variety of tops, many men tend to reach for the t-shirt. Simple, easy to clean, and draws little attention. Since this is a safe choice for self-presenting as a boy, it's easier to have some fun and pick out shirts that align with your interests.


Many men wear t-shirts of their favorite bands, or with artwork from their favorite TV shows and movies.
If you want to give off an athletic appearance, consider buying plain white, gray, or black shirts. Also, sportswear would be a good choice for an athletic male look.;
, Most men can be seen wearing blue jeans, navy slacks, and khakis. Take a trip to the department store or even a thrift store to save money, and pick up several pairs. These will give you a solid foundation to build multiple boyish or manly outfits.


Be sure to pick pants that fit comfortably.
Currently, skinny jeans are becoming more common among men, and these could be a good fit for your new look. Keep in mind though they are more revealing of figure (leg musculature) and could potentially reveal your sex. These could be great for muscular women or gender fluid people who want to embrace their non-dichotomous self-presentation.

, A common representation of women's shoes is flats, heels, and sandals. For men you will more likely see sneakers (high, mid, and low-tops), boat shoes, boots, moccasins, and loafers. Do you want a sporty look, or more professional? Knowing the answer to this question can help guide you toward the right shoes for you.


Skateboard shops, department stores, and brand name outlets are good places to find fashionable male shoes.
When wearing formal wear, be sure to pair your outfit with smart dress shoes. It is best to have them polished without any blemishes in the material.

, Considered by some to be the ""common man's crown,"" baseball hats give you an athletic, relaxed look, that can compliment any male outfit.


Do you have a favorite sports team? Or simply a city you love and want to represent? Answering these questions can help you find a cool new accessory.
The way you wear your hat - forward, backward, angled, cocked, tilted - can convey different things about your personality, and allows you more expression in your new male look.
Be aware that sports fans may engage you based on mutual support or rivalry.

, Although they are undeniably used by girls and boys alike, women commonly carry purses instead. Trading in a purse or clutch for a simple backpack can add to your simple male appearance.

, For formal, business, and even some party occasions, it is appropriate to wear a suit and tie. Whether this is a simple blazer and overcoat, or a personally tailored tux, suits are an easy way to give off a male appearance.


Transforming the common female body into a male look often means minimizing hips and increasing shouldersConsider getting coats with shoulder pads to accentuate the appearance of a masculine build.
Loud colors like green, pink, and teal are extremely uncommon among male formal wear. In order to pass as male, you will have better luck with suits in shades of navy. Pants are typically khaki and navy. There is more wiggle room with ties. A good question to ask yourself is how much you want to stick out. For example Neil deGrasse Tyson often wears eccentric ties and garners some attention for it. On the other hand, your everyday business man on the street can usually be seen wearing a paisley, striped, or single tone tie.

, If you are older, or simply want to give off a more mature appearance, suitcases are a classic symbol of the business man. Traditionally, leather suitcases are the go-to for professionals. However, shoulder strap, and bicycle bags are steadily finding popularity among young professional men.

Cut your hair.,
Use a wig and wig cap.,
Bind your chest.,
Invest in suitable underwear.,
Do not wear make-up.,
Consider pursuing hormone treatment therapy.",How to Make a Girl Look Like a Boy2," Although there are a fair number of men who choose to grow their hair long, this is largely considered a feminine trait (at least in European-American culture). Common male hairstyles include crew cuts, comb overs, fades, faux hawks, shape-ups, and waves.


Take a look at professional hair salon photo galleries and pick out a style that appeals to you.Oftentimes it's easier to look at male celebrities to determine what kind of hair style feels appropriate or comfortable for you.

, Shaving, or even just cutting your hair isn't necessary, especially if you want to be able to wear it down and dress as a girl. If you have long hair you will need to braid it and pin it up. Then place a wig cap over your head and secure it to the hair with pins.Once this is done you can wear any wig of your choice.

, Breasts are an immediate physical trait that let people know you are a woman. In order to alter your appearance - especially for those women with curvier figures - using a binder will help you create a flatter, masculine chest.


There are companies who make binders specifically for trans men
Do not use Ace Bandage or duct tape as a binder, as this can cause scarring, limit breathing and create fluid build-up in your lungs, among other possible injuries.
Do not wear a binder for 24 hours. 8-12 hours is a safe maximum range for binder use. Do not wear a binder that is too small for you.

, If binders are too intense for you, or simply unnecessary thanks to your body size, sports bras do a good job of securing breasts and creating a masculine appearance.

, Although it may seem possible to use it to your advantage in giving your face a masculine look, ultimately the mere presence of make-up on a man (or someone dressing as one) draws attention.


If you're dead-set on integrating make-up into your transformation, try using a small amount of brown or dark eyeliner to fill in your eyebrows.

, For those transgender people looking into a serious physical transition, this can be the next major step in their lives. It's advised to always pursue hormone therapy under the guidance of a primary care physician and primary psychologist. Be sure to educate yourself on the health protocols for transgender health before seriously pursuing this."

Alter your voice.,
Avoid feminine body language and habits.,
Use typical male greetings.,
Speak to convey information.,
Spend time with male friends.",How to Make a Girl Look Like a Boy3," Pitch and pronunciation go a long way in conveying different gender presentation. Although it is common sense that a lower voice denotes masculinity, research shows that it has more to do with two things: the pronunciation of your ""s,"" and the presence of a ""vocal fry.""If you have a high-pitch voice, do not strain yourself to speak in a baritone. Instead, aim for a slightly lower, more monotone version of your natural voice.


The presence of any lisp or softness in the ""s"" is a marker of female speech patterns.Vocal fry refers to the creaky, deepened, elongation of vowels at the end of your sentence. This is also a marker of female speech patterns and is best to be avoided if you want to self-present as a boy or man.

, For example, crossing your legs, batting your eyelids, and playing with your hair.


If your male look includes long hair, don't toss your hair over your shoulder, or spend too much time touching your neck.
When sitting, lean back and allow your legs to be slightly apart.
Don't hold your wrist limply or expose your wrist too often. For example when women smoke cigarettes they sometimes hold their hand with the wrist turned out and visible.Men are more likely to turn the wrist down or hold the arm by their side.
One safe posture is to put your hands in your pockets as this is far more common among men than women.

, Although it is socially common for men to hug, it is perhaps more prevalent to greet with different variations of hand shakes and high-fives.


When shaking someone's hand, grip firmly (though not attempting to harm them), and maintain eye contact to give a confident, friendly impression.
When going to do a high-five, aim for the elbow to prevent missed connections that lead to awkward moments.

, Research shows that women often speak with the intention of creating connection and community, whereas men speak more to transfer information and determine status.


If this is a struggle for you, consider taking an assertiveness class, as this is an attribute respected among men.

, In the process of self-presenting as a man, we can get hung up in the socially conditioned notions of ""how to be a man."" However, the truth is there is no one right way. And a great way to find out how you can comfortably present as one yourself, is the hang around individual men or boys and observe their personalities and behavior.


If you have any close male friends you are comfortable discussing it with, talk to them about your attempts to self-present as male and see what solutions you can come up with together.

Stick to black clothing.,
Wear big jewelry that matches your clothes.",How to Look Like Winona Ryder," Wear red lipstick or dark peach or pink. Smooth all makeups on lightly. Wear dark mascara and eye shadow. Make your eye brows a nice oval shape.;
, Winona's hair has been several different shades and cuts over the years.


Winona's hair has been dark brown most of the time, but has taken on many different cuts. For example Heathers era Winona's hair was a mid length, thick bob, Girl Interrupted era Winona had a short layered pixie crop and Turks and Caicos era Winona has long, slightly waved hair.

Her hair has also been different colours though, such as her black straight Bob circa Mermaids, her long wavy strawberry blonde circa Edward Scissorhands, and a lighter blonde-brown curl circa The Darwin Awards. It is best to choose the style and colour that will suit YOU the best! A general safe bet would be mid length, dark brown.

, Winona almost always wears black or other dark, muted shades, not loud, extravagant colours. Keep this in mind when trying to emulate her style.


When you are going out to a dinner or similar casually formal event, wear short dresses with heeled boots, heels, or casual shoes.
When you are dressing casually, do not over dress. Wear shorts or pants with a comfortable shirt and shoes. A simple pair of black jeans with a black shirt, leather jacket and boots is very nineties Noni!
When you are dressing for a formal occasion, wear long elegant dresses with heels.







, Since Winona has a generally simple, minimalistic style, big jewellery can help make your outfit a bit more detailed!

Skin Care.,
Recreate River's makeup.,
Curl your hair.,
Dress the part.,
Hold your head high.",How to Look Like River Song," The first thing people see when they look at you is often your face! This makes skin care a very important factor in replicating River Song's look. River has clear skin in a lighter shade, but even if your skin is a different shade it's still possible to make your skin color work.

Keep your skin clean and healthy! River Song's complexion is always clear and without blemishes. Wash your face every day, use sunscreen and moisturizer, and avoid excessively touching your face; it leaves dirt and bacteria that cause pimples. For more skin tips, try How to Get Clear, Smooth Skin or How to Have an Acne Free Face.
If you want to make your skin color darker or lighter to match River Song's skin, you can do so with makeup; however, this is a tricky feat that requires time and practice to get down perfectly, as changing your skin color can make you look oddly unnatural sometimes. As intense and time-consuming as this step is, try saving it just for days when you want to do a full-out River Song cosplay.;
, Most of the time it's very natural-looking, and very basic, with some slight variations depending on what she's wearing.

For the base, apply a tinted moisturizer or foundation that matches your skin shade, starting in areas the need more coverage, like under the eyes. Then blend the moisturizer/foundation evenly over the rest of your face, going down your chin onto your neck. Dust just a little loose or pressed powder evenly over the foundation. The idea is to have a smooth, simple, natural look.
Add some simple eyeliner and a tinted lip gloss to finish your easy look.
If you want to dress the look up a little, like River does when she goes out for a night on the town with the Doctor, go for a skin color or soft taupe on the lid, with brown or black liner (depending on how natural you want to go). Use whatever coverage foundation or BB cream you prefer, and a berry or pink lip color with a slight gloss.



 


Another thing to try is to go with red lipstick and a smokier eye color.






Look around at some pictures of River Song from the different episodes she's in, and pay attention to her lipstick and eye color. Try recreating her different makeup looks, and see which ones you like best.

, River Song's hair is one of her most well-known physical features, so getting this step down is key! The main idea is a wild mop of corkscrew blonde curls.

If you already have naturally wild, curly hair, good for you! Just add some light product to add volume and make your hair shine, and you are done!
If you have long, straight or wavy hair, there are a variety of methods you can use to get tighter curls. Try looking at some articles like how to Use a Curling Wand, Use Hair Rollers (smaller rollers make tighter curls), Create Pin Curls, or Curl Hair with Rags. If none of these options work, you could try going to your hairdresser and getting a perm (a.k.a. permanent or permanent wave). This option is far more, well, permanent than the others, so think carefully and make sure it's what you really want.






If you do decide to go with your natural hair, but it's not the right color, you can temporarily or permanently dye it. River Song's hair has darker roots, and lightens up in the middle and at the ends. Look for boxed/bottled dyes at your local stores, or go to a hairdresser and have them do it. Either way, be sure to print out several pictures of River Song for reference so you get the right shades of blonde.
If your hair is too short to curl, or you don't want to mess with all the styling, you can always buy a wig. Any wig that is blonde, fairly short, and very curly will work just fine.

, Out of all the characters in the 'New Who', River's apparel is possibly the most difficult to replicate, since she rarely ever wears the same outfit twice. Not to mention that Doctor Who is very science fiction-looking, so River sometimes wears some very interesting articles of clothing.

If you want to take a modern look, you could adapt River's denim outfit from The Impossible Astronaut episode. This outfit includes a pair of jeans, a matching denim jacket, a simple white button-up blouse with a collar, and some brown cowboy boots. Be sure to fold the shirt collar over the jacket collar, and wear the jeans over the boots instead of tucked in.
Another fairly easy option would be the army outfit from Flesh and Stone. Simply find matching brown camouflage pants and a shirt (in your size!), tie your hair back into a ponytail, and viola!
A classier idea would be the dress from Time of the Angels. Any black dress with a 'v' neckline, empire waist, and long sheer sleeves would suffice nicely. Pair this with red high heels and lipstick. Or try the green dress from Day of the Moon; long, empire waist, 'v' neckline, olive green, with wider shoulder straps and no sleeves. Wrap your hair up in a messy bun to complete this style.
If you're feeling very ambitious, you could buy or recreate River's gray dress from Day of the Moon. This outfit is probably one of River's most well-known, but due to the strange style, is hard to get. You could browse online for a pattern, or alter a pair of loose gray harem pants sewed to a matching gray tank top. This look goes with a wide black belt and tall black boots.
Don't forget the accessories! River always carries around a blue journal that looks like the TARDIS; you can find replicas on ThinkGeek and Etsy. She also occasionally has a time vortex manipulator, her own sonic screwdriver (both found on ThinkGeek or Amazon), and her trusty sonic blaster (you'll have to be creative and make your own version, as no replica of this has yet been made).
You can always make your own outfit as well. Just remember, whatever River wears, she wears proudly and with poise, no matter how beautiful or ridiculous it is. Carry that attitude over and strut your stuff!

, River Song always adds an air of glamor to whatever she's doing. Even though you can't necessarily 'wear' glamor, your posture is a physical feature, and good posture adds a lot to the glamor factor.

Straighten your spine and pull back those shoulders! River hardly ever slouches. Slouching informs people that you are uninterested, or don't care, and River is just about the opposite of those ideals! For more information on correct posture, check out How to Improve Your Posture.
Be graceful. Although River doesn't always walk like a model, she's nimble and light on her feet. Whether she's running through the TARDIS console room, wielding her sonic blaster at some Silence, or walking in high heels through New York City, you can bet she's as smooth as silk.

Be mysterious.,
Congratulations.",How to Look Like Serena Van Der Woodsen," Serena's skin is flawless. Of course, everyone's skin has bad days and nobody's skin can be blemish free, but there are ways of making sure you prevent the build up of acne.


Cleanse and tone your face daily both morning and night to prevent the build up of grease and oil in your pores.
If you have acne, don't wash your face more than twice a day, if you do, your skin is likely to be inflamed and make the problem worse.To fix blemishes, use a colorless foundation and dab it on noticeable zits, don't cover up the face, let it breathe. The less coverage means the quicker your face will get rid of the acne.;
, Serena's skin is described in the Gossip Girl books as perfect, smooth and fair. Her cheeks are often flushed and rosy. Her complexion is flawless, and often tanned after exotic holidays in the Caribbean or on a private island. For the less fortunate (which is most of us), here are some steps on how to obtain that look:


Moisturise your skin daily to keep it soft and hydrated.
Make sure your legs, underarms and bikini line are always well groomed (for example waxed or shaved).
Serena looks tanned and healthy all year long. To achieve this apply a gradual build-up tan. Do your research on the safety of tanning and tanning lotions before you use them. You may change your mind and you should make an informed decision, not simply follow the beauty herd. Serena would never do tanning beds. Don't overdo the spray tanning or self tanner. An orange bod is so not... hot.
Make sure you always smell fresh by wearing fragranced deodorants and applying light amounts of perfume or body spray.
Visit your dermatologist for a healthy set of products to get your skin in perfect condition. If you have minor acne, just get a gentle cleanser and maybe an over-the-counter cream.

, Serena does not wear lots of make-up. Less is always more and it's best not to wear a lot of facial products on your face as it can result in the build-up of acne.


Eyes: Serena has huge, navy blue eyes, with thick lashes that never require any form of makeup. Some of us aren't that fortunate. If you have small eyes, don't make it worse by lining the eyes with eyeliner on the top and bottom, that just makes the closeness appear worse. To make the eyes look bigger, line the inside corner of the eye with white eyeliner, it widens up the look of the eye. If your eyes are large, don't do that, the majority of the time it just looks weird. For mascara, don't load it on, coarse lashes are clumpy and ugly. Try using a little brush on the bottom, an a large brush on the top. Two swipes on top, and one on the bottom. Don't overload on eyeliner, it looks trashy and Serena isn't. Just line the top of the eye with a thin line to define it. If you like eyeshadow, use a pretty coir that complements the skin tone.
Mouth: Serena has perfectly shaped lips. Her lips are not too thin, but not too plump. If you have thin lips, try using lipliner. Make the line discreet though, and make sure it matches the lip color. Or, get a lip plumping lipgloss. Try Sephora for one. Serena usually just dabs some cherry chapstick on her lips, so make your color natural and opt for chapstick or Vaseline, or a clear gloss. Also Serena has a perfect smile that models spend years trying to achieve. If your teeth are far from perfect visit your orthodontist if you can, or use a straightening system such as lumineers. A beautiful smile is worth the money. Serena's teeth are white. So brush brush brush! Or use whitening strips, but don't over-bleach the teeth so that the color looks unnatural. No one wants a horse mouth!

, Serena's body is free of flab, toned, taut, tall, and lean. Serena has the surreal gift of not exercising, eating what she wants, and never gaining an unwanted ounce. Hardly any of us have that, so exercise, and eat right. Yeah, you've heard that a million times, but it works. Not keen on running or lifting weights? Do pilates, it will kill the flab on your limbs and keep your body lean and your skin tight. Or try yoga, if you're feeling stressed, it practically will have the same effect. Don't go to unhealthy steps to be skinny though, that's wrong, you should love your body for what it is. If you are on the short side, try some killer high heels.

, Serena has gorgeous, pale long, blonde hair, often said to be flaxen. To achieve this, use a shampoo that fits your hair type, and that smells good..


For example, if you have oily hair, don't use a moisturizing shampoo.
You don't have to dye your hair, but if you do, and if you have the time and money, go to a professional. If you can't do that though, just get a natural blonde color from a trusted dye company. Try going to a beauty outlet, one that has a billion colors to choose from. Don't bleach it though, Serena's isn't bleached.
Serena's hair is straight, but not stick straight. Just straighten the strands of the hair that are curly. Make it look natural like you just woke up with it like that. If your hair is sensitive to heat, don't fry it by using a straightener, try a straightening shampoo.
If you're a brunette and you don't want to dye, try getting honey highlights, but don't make it streaky.

, Whatever your hair add some mousse to it. Then tousle it dry or use a diffuser, straighten any flyaways and just use some hairspray. Serena has messy bedhead hair which is always looking healthy therefore if your hair is dry use a nightly leave in conditioner treatment on your hair to restore its natural state.

, Serena is said to be able to pull off any piece of clothing at any given moment. Not everyone has the luxury of that. Serena wears crazy prints, her brother's Oxford shirts, grungy boarding school clothes, and pretty much anything. She always looks perfect in whatever she is dressed in. She even goes topless on the beach. Serena doesn't have a signature style though, which leaves this part up to you. Fashion is a form of self expression and shouldn't be copied, but created. Be unique and shine!


Wear what flatters your body and feels comfortable. After all, wearing a piece of clothing that doesn't feel right is the same as wearing a piece of clothing that doesn't look right.
Wear what suits you and express yourself.
And all of you gorgeous girls that wear glasses, try looking for contact lenses.

, For example, a pair or two of skinny jeans, a well fitted black blazer, a cricket style jumper, a well fitted coat or jacket, tank tops, polo tops, formal dresses, flat boots and flat ballet style shoes.

, Serena likes to wear a lot of chunky necklaces, delicate bracelets and classic earrings. For example, a pretty silver charm bracelet and pearl earrings, nothing too trashy. For a handbag, choose something like a town and country handbag which is fairly large, as Serena often likes large and colourful handbags. Perhaps attach a silk scarf around your neck or handbag to bring back that old school elegance look.

, Serena has a signature scent, try to find a perfume that matches your personality or do your own fragrance (it's very easy, just find right essential oils and mix it), and never forget to wear it. Make sure it's light and airy, and not thick and musky, headaches aren't fun.

, Have good table manners and good communication skills.

, Serena is known to always cheer her friends up, after all every cloud has a silver lining.

, Serena as known to be a party girl, so go to parties, enjoy yourself. Dance until dawn and flirt up a storm with the hot host, to the nerdy bookworm in the corner.

, Serena keeps her cool in even the most gruesome situations.

, Serena is kind to everyone. Even if you totally hate someone, keep the claws in, and vent to your besties later.

, Serena is oblivious to her perfection, and never boasts about her looks, so you should do the same. Don't brag, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

, Serena is never alone, always travel in a pair, or group. Though, don't be afraid to be alone. Have confidence, always hold your head up high. Cats prey on insecurity.

, Have a cloud of mystery around you, leave people questioning about who you are. Keep some secrets to yourself.

, You are now a real life Serena Van Der Woodsen! Enjoy being yourself!

Only wear clothing from the quality food groups.,
Take care of yourself.,
Remember that oral hygiene is crucial.,
Keep nails on the short side, and natural.,
Have your Highlights be fresh and as natural looking as possible.,
Tweeze/wax eyebrows to keep them neat but never too thin.

,
KISS.,
Dot expensive perfume on your wrists and behind your ears.,
Eat right, exercise.,
Accessorize!,
Carry a bag that will last for years.,
Don't talk about how much money you have/don't have.",How to Look Like Old Money," Tweed, cotton, wool, linen, silk and cashmere. These are lasting fabrics that will hold their shape well and will not develop the small balls of threads and fibers that collect on garments from wear. Avoid acrylic, rayon, polyester and other such blends.


Color of tops should be kept somewhat neutral. Black, beige, brown, white and pastels.
Sweaters and coats are best kept black because they will go with everything.
Wool pea-coats are something worth splurging on. They have been classy and stylish since the 1940s. It is something that you will wear for the rest of your life.
T-shirts, tank tops and light sweaters can be found for between $10-$25 made from quality cotton. Shop at discount stores (Saks Off-Fifth Avenue, T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, Loehmann's, Burlington Coat Factory, etc.) for pricier items, such as cashmere or wool sweaters.
Jeans are always a safe choice, just make sure that they fit well. They don't have to be designer either. Levi's are just fine for hanging out around town. Keep in mind that rhinestones on your bottom are not okay.
Wool or tweed pants are nice for gatherings, dinners, coffee dates, etc. Pair them with a nice blouse or sweater.
Avoid logos on clothing. Brand logos suggest that you have a need to impress others, however clothing without brand logos suggests confidence and security with who you are.
Shoes are another area that will be worth the splurge. Invest in a versatile heel, something appropriate for all occasions. Black, leather, medium heel, slight peep-toe have been the most widely used in my experience. They can be worn with everything from a little black dress, to an interview or simply out to lunch.
Comfortable, durable leather flats are also a great choice, Cole Haan makes them in all sorts of colors and they are available at the Cole Haan Outlet for 50-75% less than retail.;
, Don't pick at your skin, use whatever keeps it clear and use it consistently. Old money can afford to do what it takes to keep their skin clear and healthy (facials, Crème De La Mer, whatever).

, Brush and floss 2-3 times daily.

, No fake long acrylics that destroy your natural nails. Keep polish neutral as well; beige, opaque white, light translucent pink. Don't forget about your toes, if they're going to be showing! Find a cheap salon that you can stop by 2-3 times a month.

, Hair can be any length as long as it's trimmed, natural colors (not pink) and styled in a tasteful way (no mohawks).

,, Keep It Simple Silly! Makeup should be kept incredibly simple. Sheer foundation, concealer where needed, easy blush, mascara and lip balm. Not gloss. If your activities call for eyeshadow, stick to taupe and browns or pastels.

, Even the most pricey perfume costs a mere 35 cents a day if you go through one bottle a year. It compliments your own natural scent, you don't want to swim in it.

, Old money is rarely obese.

, Develop signature pieces that you love (and will love for years) and wear them every day.


Wedding/engagement rings, diamond/pearl pendant necklaces with gold/white gold chains, Tiffany & Co. right hand rings, diamond studs (ALWAYS classy), pearl earrings. No stretched ears, quadruple piercings, etc. Keep it to one or two jewelry accessories.
Wear really nice jewelry with casual outfits. If you have on jeans and a nice shirt (but still casual) put on a nice pair of diamond studs and maybe a ruby (it can be fake, or just a cheap quality, but make sure it looks nice/real) ring. Remember not to brag about your nice jewelry. If you were really old money you wouldn't have to brag because it is assumed by others you can afford nice things and it is considered bad taste to brag.

, It will save money in the long run if you have one or two bags that you will use for 20-plus years. Coach is a good choice and will repair and clean damaged purses you have purchased from them, no charge, for a lifetime. L.L. Bean totes are incredibly durable for overnight stays and beach days. Even the customized totes they make are less than $50. No big, noticeable logos.


A Timex Easy Reader with a leather strap can keep you from constantly digging through your purse for your cell phone to check the time. It also sends the message that you have places to be, people to see.

, Don't discuss the financial status of others. Don't lie. Think before you speak. Go with the flow. Relax! You just got back from your summer house in the Hamptons after all.

Nicole's hair is blonde.,
Wear make-up.,
Wear ""glamorous"" clothes.,
If you want to take it one step further, a green cocktail dress is great for a night out.

Don't completely push everyone away!,
Be a real girly girl.,

Nicole lives in Sydney, Australia, and so she speaks with an Australian accent.

,
Nicole is a beach babe.",How to Look Like Nicole from Home and Away," It looks as thought it has been bleached, so don't worry too much if your hair isn't naturally blonde. You don't have to dye your hair, blonde highlights are fine. Nicole's hair is straight but sometimes it looks like she has curled it but so it looks wavy not really curly so you can curl your hair but not all the time. Nicole usually leaves her hair out but she is also occasionally seen with it in a bun or in a ponytail. Her hair is also quite shiny so look for products that help make your hair look shiny.;
, Nicole uses foundation, eyeshadow (usually a peachy pink or for a more dramatic look, dark brown/black), lipgloss (usually a light pink), blush (usually a dark rose), mascara (black) and eyeliner (quite dramatic on the bottom and top and a black color)also if you have acne use something to treat it.

, Gold waistcoats, dark skinny jeans, silver heels, pink miniskirts with matching leggings, sparkly scarves, anything you have seen her wearing. Maybe try creating your own style. A casual outfit for Nicole usually consists of a white or coloured top combined with something as simple as a denim mini skirt. To make the look stand out more, Nicole uses simple accessories, such as a headscarf or, her signature item: oversized sunglasses! Although living in a small town, Nicole is a sophisticated city-girl at heart, and that means she is always prepared to dress up for more formal occasions. A nice and elegant look can easily be created by wearing a black, silk-inspired top with a white or otherwise lightly coloured skirt.

,, The last thing to add in order to copy Nicole's elegant Hollywood style, is a black purse, and voila, you're good to go! Take notes while watching the show and look in google images and eventually you will get the idea of her style. Also if you see something she's wearing that you really like write it down and while your shopping if you see a look-a-like of it buy it.

, At least 15 sit ups a day will be enough. If you begin feeling tired, or suffer pain from exercising, you can stop.

, Try to figure out the difference and balance of being independent and being a loner.

, Honestly, have you ever seen her wearing baggy sweatpants and an old grey t-shirt? No! She always wears perfect, well fitting girly clothes (as mentioned before).

, There is no point in doing this all if you are not enjoying it! If you feel it's not really you, just be yourself again.

,, Soak up the Aussie sun on the beach in a bright coloured bikini. Nicole has been seen in a bright yellow and a hot pink bikini. Make sure you have a toned stomach though.

Hair.,
Makeup.,
Clothing.,
Pout and add a bit of a smirk to your smile like Louise did in her movies.",How to Look Like Louise Brooks," Louise was one of the women in the 20s who cut her hair short ""a la garçonne"" in a bob style.


The easiest option is a sleek and straight bob with front bangs, the length being just at the end of the cheekbone but there are two other options.
*The other option is one Louise herself sported in her later days in hollywood, soft finger waves (which is easier for wavy and curly hair).
*The third, for people who don't want to cut their long hair is a low bun covered with hair folded over it. Louise didn't wear it, but it is a good alternative.
Pair your 'dos with flower crowns, cloche hats, drapey scarves, feathered headbands and berets.;
, Makeup is very simple, as few makeup products were available in the 20s.


Matte Powder. Louise had light skin, so if you have dark skin use a shade lighter than usual. If you want to feel really 20s use a powder puff.
Louise had her eyebrows plucked and drawn on, but a modern girl who wants to keep her eyebrows could simply cover them and draw on her shape. Use a dark eyebrow pencil in either case.
Black kohl around the eyes to get a piercing gaze.
A light puff of red blush, barely noticeable was Louise's signature look.
Dark red lipstick, extending the cupids bow a bit onto the skin. Don't forget the lipliner!

, Wear knee length undefined waistline, sleeveless, boat and scoop neck dresses, loose swing coats, tutus, sheer brown stockings and even occasionally a tuxedo! For colors wear white, black, silver and jewel tones. Don't forget leather french heel shoes!

, Make your expressions a bit emphasized, not as much as a film star, just more than your girl on the street. Remember, Louise was a movie star and she presented herself like one.

Always wear something comfortable.,
Always have a keen eye.,
Increase your vocabulary, and stay away from slang terms.,
Buy the preppy style clothes.,
Here are some suggestions for that type of clothing:


Polo shirts
Oxford shirts (unlike polos, oxford shirts should always be long-sleeved if it is warm outside simply roll up the sleeves)
Rugby shirt
Cable-knit vests and sweaters (traditional cricket sweaters)
A jacket or blazer (navy blue is a staple; try seersucker or madras plaid in summer, tweed or corduroy in winter)
Chino pants-could have cuffs
Khaki pants.,
Wear preppy shoes and accessories like these:


Pearl necklaces and earrings are a must, as well as diamond jewelry (make sure it's small, not fake-looking, and doesn't look too trashy or tacky)
Most preps wear their mother's, grandmother's, or aunt's old diamond and pearl jewelry, as an ""old money"" thing.,
Stand up to others.,
Wear Vintage clothing.",How to Look Like Nancy Drew," If you put your hair in a braid, ponytail, or up in any way, wear a ribbon. Do not put your hair into a messy ponytail. Bangs are okay part your hair to the side and wear a headband if it is down. You can dye it strawberry blonde or red if you want and get colored contacts for blue eyes.;
, Take a shower at least once a day. Brush your teeth and wash your face twice a day. Shave into your wardrobe. Lots and lots of plaid. You can usually get plaid clothing such as skirts and jackets from department stores (Kohl's or Candies in the U.S.). A little sleuthing is likely to get you a pair of adorable plaid shorts. For a well put together outfit, use a complimentary color combination. Match one or two colors from the plaid design with a top, jacket, headband, etc.

, Be modest and wear preppy clothes from stores like J. Crew, Lacoste, Ralph Lauren, Banana Republic, etc. If you want more high end clothing try Burberry, who is known for their plaid. Be original too. An interesting option are pleated or pencil skirts. They add to the timeless sincerity of the outfit.

, Nancy Drew’s style is in stores right now, so you can usually find quite a collection of cute, wind-banded headbands in stores. Keep your color combinations in mind when buying them.

, They are practical and sincere, just like Nancy Drew. If you can't find penny loafers or ballet flats, try Sperry boat shoes.

, They add polish and also keep you warm. Neutral, flesh, ivory or white are best for the look.

, It will look lovely. Nancy wears one with her initials on it. If you don't have one like that opt for a pretty butterfly brooch.

, Get timeless, classic clothes that will always look stylish. DO get brands such as J.Press, Ralph Lauren, Brooks Brothers, Jack Rogers, J. Crew, Vineyard Vines, Lacoste, Nantucket Brand, Amanda's, Burberry, Lilly Pulitzer, Bloomingdales, & Saks 5th avenue.

, Nancy Drew often ties sweaters around her shoulders.

, Nancy knots them on the side of her neck. You can get scarves at thrift stores, or just about any store that sells garments.

, Don't wear something like, a leather jacket (makes too much noise), flip flops (makes running difficult), and jeans (brushes and makes noise when walking or running). These kinds of clothes give yourself away very easily. Try to wear matching clothes so you look sophisticated. sporty clothes are good for running and don't make much noise.

, There is always something interesting happening. Never let anything out of your sight. Nancy Drew saw everything very quickly, and you have to do the same in order to be like her.( remember everything is some kind of evidence, not all in the same case though!)

, Never swear around people who might take offence to it (such as older people, teachers, or children) or say racist/sexist/homophobic comments.This makes you ugly on the inside and rude.

, Just because you got some clothes from an upper class store doesn't mean they are preppy. Buy clothes that are classic, and clean-cut. Don't be afraid to splurge on these a little, as preps tend to hold onto clothes for a long time. Remember to make sure your clothes are always clean, and always match. Good fabrics are very important. Get rid of any polyester. Buy mostly 100%cotton, wool and cashmere. Wear preppy colors. Bright and happy, like green, pink, light blue, nautical red, white and navy blue and preppy patterns such as plaid, stripes, gingham, polka dots, argyle, floral, paisley, nova checks, and tartan.

, The prep equivalent to jeans
Bermuda shorts (khaki, madras plaid, seersucker, linen or preppy prints and patterns)
Skirts (khaki, madras plaid, seersucker, linen, preppy prints and patterns such as Lilly Pulitzer)
Tea dresses and summer dresses (in madras plaid, preppy colors, seersucker, or linen). A-line dresses, halters, and flowy dresses are acceptable.
Tennis- and golf-inspired shirts, skirts, and dresses

,
Small handbags in simple colors and patterns or large, monogrammed tote bags (L.L. Bean, and Lands' End have good choices). Vera Bradley handbags and wallets are also very preppy but make sure to get the right pattern (in preppy colors)
Hair accessories such as headbands (silk/satin scarf headbands or hard headbands with ribbon bows) and grosgrain ribbons in preppy colors, prints, and patterns.
Ribbon belts in a variety of preppy prints, patterns, and colors or, especially for guys, black or brown leather belts.
Preppy girls wear ballet flats, top-siders (boat shoes), ribbon/canvas flip-flops, Rainbow sandals, and simple leather high heels and wedges in shoes.
Wearing a pair of top-siders without socks is classic preppy.

, You can't let your partner be let down. You have to be nice to be a prep. Don't be too nice though because people will think that you are a weirdo. And Nancy Drew isn't a weirdo. She will speak up and be kind to everyone.

, Such as Old Blazers, Long trench coats (Woman's), only slightly heeled shoes (Preferably with a strap and/or bow) and pleated skirts! Oh, and always remember a magnifying glass!

Find out if any of your current medications cause excess saliva production.",How to Stop Drooling in Your Sleep1," Side-sleepers are more prone to drooling during the night simply because gravity is causing the mouth to open and allowing drool to pool on your pillow. Try sleeping on your back and tucking yourself in so that you do not shift around during the night.;
, If you can't sleep without laying on your side, trying propping yourself in a more vertical position to encourage your mouth to close and create a better air flow.

, The main reason that people drool is that their nasal sinuses are clogged. As a result, they end up breathing through their mouth and drooling in the process.


Try applying sinus-clearing products like Vick's Vaporub and Tiger Balm directly under your nose to loosen clogged nostrils.






Smell essential oils such as Eucalyptus and Rose before going to bed to clear sinuses and soothe yourself to sleep.






Take a hot, steamy shower before bed to allow the pure vapors to cleanse your sinuses., Untreated conditions can cause post nasal drip and excess saliva while you sleep., Excess saliva can be a symptom of many different medications. Read the warning label and ask your doctor about potential side effects of your medications.

Resort to surgery.",How to Stop Drooling in Your Sleep2," If you experience difficulty sleeping, heavy breathing, loud snoring, or heavy drooling, you may have sleep apnea. Sleep apnea causes your breath to become shallow and thin during sleep.


Some behaviors and conditions can increase your risk of sleep apnea. These include smoking, high blood pressure, and people at high risk for heart failure or stroke.






Your doctor can determine if you have slept apnea by running various sleep monitoring tests and learning about your sleep history.







, Drooling is also a symptom of a blocked airway. Visit an ear, nose, and throat doctor to find out if a blocked airway is affecting your ability to breathe through your nose while sleeping., If you are overweight, you have a heightened chance of experiencing sleep apnea. More than half of the 12 million people in the U.S. that experience sleep apnea are overweight. Alter your diet and exercise regularly to reach a healthy weight and decrease your neck girth for easier breathing., Sleep apnea is treated a number of different ways in addition to weight loss recommendations. Those diagnosed with sleep apnea should avoid alcohol, sleeping pills, and sleep deprivation. Simple nasal sprays and saline solution rinses can help clear nasal passages as well., Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first treatment that people who are suffering from sleep apnea undergo. CPAP outlines that patients must wear a mask that forces air through the nose and mouth while sleeping. The idea is to have the right amount of air pressure filtering through the air passages to prevent the upper airway tissues from collapsing as you sleep.

, These devices prevent the tongue from collapsing into the throat airway and can advance the lower jaw to open an airway further.

, People who have obstructive tissue such as a deviated septum, enlarged tonsils, or an over-sized tongue can be good candidates for various surgical procedures.



Somnoplasty uses radio frequency to constrict the soft palate at the back of the throat and open the airway.
'Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty' (surgical procedure), or UPPP/UP3, can remove soft tissue in the back of the throat surgically to open the airway.

Nasal surgery consists of several procedures that can fix obstructions or deformities like deviated septums.

A tonsillectomy can remove oversized tonsils that are obstructing your airway.

Mandibular/maxillary advancement surgery consists of moving the jawbone forward to create space in the throat. This is a rather intense procedure that is reserved for only the worst cases of sleep apnea."

Physical activity increases blood flow to all parts of the body, resulting in you feeling more energized overall.Studies show that you are more productive after exercise.


If you have time to hit the gym mid-afternoon, do so. You may have to slow down on your regular workout routine due to energy deprivation, but any amount of physical activity can help you recharge for the remainder of the day.If you're stuck at work, try taking a short walk during your lunch break or doing some light stretches at your cubicle.Strive to get at least 30 minutes of exercise in mid-afternoon for the best results and the most energy.;
, A cup of coffee in the morning or mid-afternoon is a go-to for many for a reasons. Caffeine is a powerful stimulant that can wake you up and help you stay alert throughout the day.


People have a substance called adenosine in their brains that binds to nerve receptors, which slows down nerve cells and causes drowsiness. The brain mistakes caffeine for adenosine and receptors bind to it instead. Instead of slowing down nerve cells, caffeine speeds up nerve cells resulting in your feeling energized.Timing is important when it comes to caffeine consumption. It takes about 20 or 30 minutes for caffeine to start working, so aim to have a cup of coffee right before your afternoon meeting.Doctors recommend you only consume 400 milligrams of caffeine a day, and an eight ounce cup of coffee has about 100. Keep this in mind as you consume caffeine so you don't go overboard., If you're feeling fatigued, it's best to skip a heavy lunch and instead eat a small meal packed with energy-rich foods.


Sleep deprivation can affect ghrelin and leptin, which are the hormones responsible for controlling hunger. This means when you're tired, you may have an increased appetite and crave high-calorie, high-carb foods. However, the way refined carbohydrates like white breads and white pastas work cause a sudden spike and then drop in blood sugar, leaving you feeling sleepy shortly after eating.Instead, stick to healthy, whole grain carbohydrates and fruits and vegetables. For lunch, try a small salad with nuts and a small piece of whole grain bread. You could also try something with lean protein, like fish, along with some greens and fruit., Engaging in brief periods of meditation can help you re-energize during the day by momentarily relaxing your mind and body.


Try to aim for five minutes of meditation towards the middle of the day, when you're most likely to have a dip in energy.
Lie on the floor with your arms on the floor and your legs on a wall. Move from focusing your mind on one part of the body to another, relaxing as you go.If it's hard to lie down, you can simply stay in your chair and pull your calves and feet up to the seat. Raising your legs can alter blood flow and help energize your body., If you wake up after only a small amount of sleep, it might be tempting to hit the snooze bar and enjoy an additional seven or nine minutes of rest. However, this will actually result in you feeling more tired in the morning.


The sleep you have during those few minutes are of minimal quality. You end up going straight back into REM sleep if you're pulled from sleep too quickly, and the shock of waking from REM sleep repetitively leaves you more tired than you would have been if you had simply woken up.It's better to set the alarm as late as you can possibly sleep and get up and get going on the first buzz. Even if it's hard, you'll end up feeling more energized throughout the morning., Eating breakfast within 30 minutes of waking up will improve your cognitive performance and overall energy throughout the day.


Once again, if you're tired you'll crave simple carbohydrates and sugar, but you should strive for a healthy, energy boosting breakfast instead.Choose whole grains and fruit for breakfast. Have yogurt with berries and granola or oatmeal with fruit., Try to get outside for a few minutes shortly after you wake up. Sunlight will help energize you, even if you're running on a small amount of sleep.


Bright, natural light boosts energy and body temperature. It'll also stall your circadian rhythm, slowing the urge to get back in bed.Do not wear sunglasses. Sunglasses block the UV lights that you need to energize., If you're prone to fatigue, you should make an appointment with your doctor to rule out potential medical problems.


Iron-deficiency, anemia, and hypothyroidism can all cause chronic fatigue and can be diagnoses with a simple blood test. If you're diagnosed with one of these disorders, your doctor can prescribe medication to lessen symptoms, including fatigue.If you have trouble sleeping, your doctor may able to prescribe or suggest a safe sleep medication or herbal supplement to encourage sleep., Look through the medications you're currently taking and see if any of your meds may be causing your fatigue.


Many prescription drugs include fatigue in their possible list of side effects. If your dose is too high, fatigue is more likely. If you think a medication you're on is causing you to feel tired throughout the day, talk to your doctor about altering your dosage or managing side effects.A lot of psychiatric drugs can cause fatigue. If your tiredness is so bad you're having trouble functioning in your day-to-day life, your psychiatrist may be able to switch you to an alternative med to see if the side effects are less acute., Developing good sleep habits can help improve the quality and duration of your sleep at night, resulting in less fatigue throughout the day.


Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, including weekends, can help you fall asleep and wake up faster as your body will adapt to a schedule.Do not use electronics half an hour before bed, as the light generated by laptops, TV screens, and smart phones interfere with sleep. Instead, try a low-key activity like reading or doing a crossword puzzle.If your exercise regularly, make sure to time your workouts effectively.
